I know people want realistic but I... I prefer playing as Mrs. Squid shooting paint everywhere.I tried each of the three main weapons and fell in love with the Splattershot. The Roller wasnt bad but I felt helpless most of the time during the couple rounds I used it because I had no range against Splattershooters. The Charge Shot...

3923454,0,t3_35dyu2,I was actually on three teams with no chargers versus teams with multiple rollers and we won every time. I played charger every time and all you have to do is NOT GO IN. You stay behind and DEFEND at vantage points. I felt OP at time just sniping and covering yes it can cover well just in straight lines and you dont have to charge all the way land. You know those jump off parts on to the lower bridged off area in Saltspray Zone? I camped at the jump off point and killedinked anyone and everywhere  in the area. All I had to do was check the map constantly to make sure no one was behind me and Id kill them. And if I was confident the lower half of the map was covered id move to the high points on the map and just take land and kills. Rollers couldnt do anything at a distance and on the ground.,splatoon,cr3id04,3,t5_324q4

Rollers are pathetically easy to shut down on Saltspray Rig neither of the two most important areas work in their favor with how easy it is to gain higher elevation than them. They have to go to the less important side areas where theres a smaller chance of being killed and someone can easily see where theyre going on the minimap and hunt them down.,splatoon,cr4gljp,2,t5_324q4

3934868,0,t3_35i7y2,Depends in which way you look at it.Public Matches?  Nope and I am happy that it is that way. Games like CoD TF and pretty much any game with voice chat defaulted to on are known to have a lot of issues when it comes to voice chat. That is micspamming cursing or simply being an asshole to other playes. Friend only matches?  Possibly yes. The game doesnt work like other shooters where a player being killed is a huge deal because it makes the other team win. Splatoon is a game where the objective is to claim turf in a fastpaced  minute match for now. Voice chatting is kinda useless where the objective is clear and simple. Now if Nintendo added a Team Deathmatch mode then voice chat WILL be handy and almost necessary.For now I am happy with Nintendos current decision.If people REALLY want to voice chat while playing Splatoon with friends there are a lot of VoIP software like Skype Teamspeak etc.,splatoon,cr4t659,2,t5_324q4

3954425,0,t3_35qpfn,Of course covering area is the objective but better movement is a more efficient means to an end. Moving faster is important to getting to choke points faster escaping a lethal situation and leaving you alive and getting better positioning to get kills and cover more area. A personal example was once I was deep in enemy ink trying to retake and an enemy came up from behind. A lot of people panic and try to squid away instantly but the enemy ink covers your feet and youll die before you can return fire. What I did was kept moving forward and used Splathopping to escape through their ink until I got to a safe place to set up an escape route.Theres a lot of advanced techniques that people think are useless to the objective but end up giving you an advantage. For example the objective in Smash Bros is to knock the enemy off the screen so why not only use smash attacks with Bowser and send them flying? Because its only one part of the game. You have to rack up damage dodge your opponents attacks and try and recover yourself if you are knocked off. I know some people who scoff at wavedashing and dash dancing as if they are totally useless but its one of those things that you cant understand until you actually incorporate it into your gameplay.,splatoon,cr71du3,2,t5_324q4

3982891,0,t1_craa156,You must be prepared for the possibility that the rollers popularity may never die off. Every shooter has that one weapon that is the most popular to use. Weve been limited to only four different weapons so far thus its still too early to tell which weapon will be the most popular.To be honest I hope some other weapon becomes popular so I can enjoy the roller without being accused of using a cheap and OP weapon. I like the roller not because everyone thinks its OP but because its very fun for me to use.,splatoon,craa9ll,1,t5_324q4
3985265,0,t1_crah62o,I understood the question as if I have roller with power up an defense up I cant change the stats freely instead I would need a new roller with other stats. In the Nintendo video I remember that you can also buy a copy of the equipment used by a oponent in the plaza and will have like half the stats that the original had and the other half random and new equipment have all stats random... so I think a Roller with defense up is possible....,splatoon,crak0on,3,t5_324q4

3996354,0,t1_crbmf90,Another workplace difference North America prioritizes efficiency and results usually. So if you are good at what you do and you do it quicker or more efficiently than your workplace peers you are a more valued employee. If person A gets the job done just as well in  hours when it takes employee B  hours to do it to the same quality person A will be more valued.In Japan the HOURS you work are looked at moreso than how well you get work done in those hours. If you are willing to work  hour days every day you will be more valued over someone who collapses after  hours of work. Those  hours dont have to be EFFECTIVE but they do have to be hours where you are attempting to work. I have read stories and watched blogs of Westerners moving to Japan and have seen many MANY cases of this. They are able to get a project done in  hours with very high quality and their peer is able to get the same project done in  or  hours. The Boss doesnt care that they could get the same quality of work done in less time. They value the amount of time instead.This leads to people being terribly overworked and less efficient workers because they are culturally expected to BE AT WORK for so many hours in a week.,splatoon,crbtfgx,5,t5_324q4

Because you know there will be that one parent I dont really feel like it needs voice chat but I guess the option wouldnt hurt. It does tend to be Nintendos nature though to minimize that sort of stuff what with the strict Miiverse rules and the shut down of flipnote and even the rules about ganging up on people in smash bros online too much. Ill give it to em for stickin with their guns so to speak. Theyre really good at taking a stance and standing by it no matter what.

4089737,0,t1_crmg0ni,gt Thats what adds replay value. You want to keep playing because its fun AND because you can get more shots at rerolling stats on your gear.What I cant just enjoy the game for its own sake if theres not some external skinner box attached? I hate that concept so damn much and it infuriates me to see so many modern games do this. If its a fun game Ill play it. You dont need to tack on some bullshit grinding to make me have fun.gtAlso this basically prevents the over popularity of cookie cutter setups and forces you to try out multiple solutions and adapt. I cant see how this could ever be bad.If cookie cutter setups are an problem then that just means the game is poorly balanced. And if thats the case then its even worse that not all players have equal access to the best setups. I dont see how that can ever be good.And if you want me to experiment? Then how about actually giving me the means to experiment on my own instead of forcing me to put up with whatever the RNG allows me to use? Being able to freely pick my build would allow more experimentation not less.,splatoon,crmgdri,1,t5_324q4

4097372,0,t3_37juib,I always thought it would be cool to have a super weapon that creates a tidal wave of your ink in front of you. It goes a short distance blocks shots and instantly splats foes. The only downside being its short range and overall slow speed.,splatoon,crnbqwd,2,t5_324q4

The automatic weapons far outrank them in that gamemode especially the splattershot jr considering how strong the bubbler is right now. Im MVP  games and I credit the bubbler exclusively for that.. The roller has its uses sure. But get more than one roller on the team and you can pretty much count it as a loss. Get one charger and your risk of losing increases by a lot. Get two? Youre screwed.Ive never seen a charger do well sure theyll have a bunch of kills but their score will be awful because they cant spread much ink.

4143876,0,t1_crrz1l9,I too am primarily a KBM guy but all I really had to adjust to was the sensitivity and the fine motion. The motion of getting near the target was fairly easy stick into gyro elevation but I had to learn the default sensitivity to not overshoot where I wanted to go basically controlling the gamepad and my wrists and not trying to fine tune with the right stick. I tried shifting it around during the last prerelease tests tutorial but nothing felt quite as right or unnecessarily unresponsive as the default settings. Come release day and a few games under my belt I feel about  of the sharpness I would get from KBM fine aiming. Theres practice to get that last bit out but thats the bit that comes with just playing the game.While I do sometimes wish I could quickly switch to twin sticks during a long stint at that point its probably a good idea for me to end the session and just take a break instead.,splatoon,crsmaso,1,t5_324q4

If you are in range of your opponent they are probably going to win the exchange so backtrack using your paved escape route and force them to chase you while you charge up and take them down. If you picked an unsafe time to charge learn to reflexively cancel the charge with a dive instead of becoming a sitting duck.Competitive mindset helps.

You then looked out of your window and saw the victim dead on the ground and the defendant was there holding a Splattershot Pro correct?...Yes. He killed her isnt it obvious?Not quite. Take a look at these results from a field test. As you can see the minimum amount of shots required to kill somebody with a Splattershot Pro is... three.Well yes bbut Im sure the kid had some damage upgrades or something...Im sorry to say witness but even with full damage upgrades three full shots are required to kill even a balloon.Uurk...Now then the question is what couldve happened? The defense proposes a theory. Seeing as how theres enemy purple ink all around the crime scene I suggest that the victim was weakened by standing in the purple ink to the point where any shots would be lethal. And as weve previously established these patterns could only be made by a roller.slams deskTheres only one person who fits all this criteria someone whos a roller is known for loving purple and frequents the crime scene Arowana Mall... the defense calls Callie to the stand!audience murmurs...jeez why did I write this again?,splatoon,crxxd16,7,t5_324q4

And also cracks open a huge opportunity for v and maybe v for those who would also want larger teamsIn other words I feel like this game type could easily adjust to any multiplayer preference. Think of it this way if you could by watching this briefly...replace the game with splatoon characters and the towers with the sponges yadda yadda and you have a capture the flagtower defense. I say that because it is a hybrid. What the creators of this game are pushing for is FRESH ideas just like turf wars is completely its very own game type to fit the game. That is why I think this could be added in conjunction with a CTF game type. Maybe I am alone in my vision... Which could very well be the case... ,splatoon,cs1nezr,1,t5_324q4

No Stealth JumpInk resistance ability on Helmet or Clothes only on Shoes LOCKED REROLL Basically the same thing we currently have but the ability to lock skills for an extra  per lock! Have  skills you really want to keep on your gear but have that Bomb Throw Range just really bringing you down? Well pay  to Lock those  abilities you want to keep for a single roll amp  Or a Super Sea Snail to reroll the unlocked ability like normal. It may have a steep cost but it will allow players to essentially Perfect their gear amp make it work with their play style. REARRANGE ABILITIES Freely rearrange the order of your abilities this has no actual gameplay effect it would just be more aesthetically pleasing for neatfreaks such as myself or people who suffer from OCD.. ,splatoon,cs4dw1u,2,t5_324q4

The only map that comes to mind where immediately taking over middle with four players would not be beneficial is Kelp Dome which has a dozen different flanking paths many of which are from above on grating that cant be inked and allows the enemies to spray ink absolutely everywhere before engaging. Other than that map I cant think of any other location that doesnt give you a benefit and allow you to ink territory to predict enemy movement and counter any flanking. ,splatoon,cs7fh6b,1,t5_324q4

Or having properly balanced teams in terms of skill WONT make games closer? Do you have any idea how stupid you sound? The biggest problem with group matchmaking is the fact that skill is so goddamn variable from person to person that at any given time you could have an unwinnable game simply because someone on your team is dead weight and not because your team as a whole failed to step up. The team could and then you could have one dense idiot dragging them all back down. The idea is to group dense idiots with dense idiots and skillful players with skillful players not a mix of both.

4313358,0,t3_3acbhl,Read the post and all comments so far heres tips that havent been posted yetCheck your gamepad for uninked spots. This goes for your side of the map and their side. Yes you take their points when you cover their ink but remember the name of the game is turf war. Cover ALL the spots you can.If you have an inkstrike around the end of the match save it til the very last  seconds then shoot a sweet spot. Yes the ink from your inkstrike will count even after the timer hits zero. Ive won many close matches this way.Ninja Squid Jump slows you down for about a second but can seriously save you from losing approx  seconds of enemy inking. This is important in Turf Wars but CRUCIAL in Splat Zones so consider finding gear that has this ability.Splat Zones can be fun but it can also be MADDENING you are not alone weve all been there. If you find yourself constantly losing to a KNOCKOUT completely then please take a break from Splat Zones. Dont come on reddit and post I H SPL ZONS CUZ No one cares. Turf Wars is alot fairer and way less stressful as you still get points even if you lose.The last but definitely not least most important tip of all.....STAY FRESH!,splatoon,csbub8d,5,t5_324q4

In order to verify abuse when it is reported snippets of audio need to be recorded and processed. This costs bandwidth storage and as analysis is a TURK task requiring human beings to make judgements manpower.From a business perspective there is no GOOD reason to add voice chat to a game that has already sold  million units and is receiving good press.I checked my play time since launch.  freakin hours! Yes my husband and I trade off and such but between two people a single player game got  hours. They dont need to add voice chat. The lobbies are fast because all players are in one lobby system. I often end up the token American on Japanese teams. If voice chat was a priority for players youd have to do lobbies by language.

4407170,0,t3_3bi69u,I think theres a combination of some actual cool lore from Nintendo and you also looking into some of it too deeply.Captain Cuttlefish is a pretty eccentric guy so I think he probably likes hanging out in Octo Valley wearing his weird old man rags and keeping an eye on those Octarians. The only part of Inkopolis we have access to looks like its very hip for squid kids which is probably why there arent any adults hanging around. If you go into the weapon testing range you can see a bunch of apartments so adults and other Inklings and species who dont care about Turf War probably all live elsewhere in the city.Jelonzo has enough understanding of Inkling to communicate even if he has poor grammar. Theres no reason to think there arent other jellyfish in the city who can speak it as well they just arent in our little hub area.A common theory is that the Inklings are actually living ink. Thats why they can transform at will and swim on a completely flat surface they just become the ink. They dont really die when splatted they just explode and then form a new body out of the ink to inhabit. So theyre more ink creatures than they are squids.Judd is definitely a mystery. He was frozen for  years but also was somehow active in the Great Turf War so his nature is unknown. It does seem like hes probably the only cat around anymore.I dont recall anyone mentioning eating squid other than Marie saying seagulls are predators of squid.,splatoon,csmf83w,13,t5_324q4

Im an NZap main and am able to beat out . gals with proper spacing always know when you are in range and maneuvering as they have a fairly slow fire rate. The NZap has plenty of power and margin for missing more so than the . gal does. Also a very easy way to beat a . gal is to run a main Def up and maybe  subs optional that rd hit will take them much more effort to kill and will slow down their kill speed allowing you to potential and more often than not effectively kill them faster.,splatoon,cspe8be,1,t5_324q4

It was harder especially when I was in an A lobby and got deranked but I learned new ways to approach each map. I fell at B and stayed there for a bit and got unlucky and fell back to B at some point. Got paired in a B lobby and applied what I had learned playing against A players on those poor guys. It didnt take long to rise up again to A.Point is dont give up and learn from your mistakes.

4448261,0,t1_csr2pdb,I actually loved playing against Japanese players on Arowana Mall because of that. Those game would go more or less like this I use the Splat ChargerI shoot and swim left look up the map on the gamepad while running over the grate. If there was any ink the hall I would throw a splat bomb over the wall as soon as I reached the solid platform killing two guys then shoot the other two who just climbed the hill of the middle path. While my team is taking the zone I would go down the left hall where I just throw the splat bomb turn right and cross the grate to the platform with a box on the enemy side. From there I would just shoot down any incoming enemy leaving only the hall as an entry point. The game would sometimes be done within  seconds. That was at B rank.I managed to pull the same strategy against western players but never as easily though since they tend to disperse a lot more and take the zone from as many places as possible.,splatoon,csre0ki,2,t5_324q4

4489144,0,t1_cswg22f,Theres two types of aiming theres tracking and flicking. Tracking is when you try to keep your crosshair on the target as much as possible and flicking is when you try and move your crosshair past the target and fire when your crosshair is riight ontop of them. Some people are better at one some at the other. Try both out and see how it works out. Im very fond of flicking but I know some people are far more comfortable and accurate with tracking.Additionally aim isnt that important in a charger. Its much more about positioning and spacing yourself so that any shots you DO get are easier on you. Its for this reason I prefer grenades since it reduces the amount of movement options the opponent has leaving me a far more predictable shot.,splatoon,cswio2v,3,t5_324q4

Even when he was forced to miss E because of the surgeries he still took time to address fans and do his work from home and answer emails. Thats dedication to a tee he would never allow a thing like his passing to get in the way of the games he worked so hard to push through. Thats how you truly remember the guy not with yells or extreme mourning but with a controller in your hand a quirky smile on your face hopefully some folks to enjoy your favorite game with and optionally the happiest tears you can muster.Sky Williams made a really touching tribute to Iwata and he ended with the note that hes going to dedicate his next playthrough of Super Mario RPG for him.

My problem is the girls Ive known who have been treated sexually be it with looks words or even actions by adults when they were as young as . And stuff like this normalizes that behaviour and yes Im sure the bulk of the people who see no real problem here would never treat an actual kid like eyecandy this way but the people who would see this and they think Yeah all these people do it too this is okay this is normal.

As an avid user of burst bombs its good to know people are catching on to their usefulness.That being said a minor tweak some of the kill thresholds require subs as well as mains to get to  damage. For example the custom jet squelcher actually requires a main AND a sub to hit . against somebody with  defense ups. Therefore its not enough to just wear one piece of squidforce gear and hit the secondary abilities jackpot. I got excited when I saw that it only takes  damage up but in testing Im hitting for . damage maximum.Also the splatterhero shot doesnt need  mains but  main and  subs to be able to hit for . against somebody with  defense up main.

Choke points is one thing but I like to play by getting behind the opposition and shooting them in the back and thats very difficult in Urchin Underpass in particular.In fairness its a fair bit better in tower mode in ranked matches as people tend to congregate around the moving tower superjump a lot more and generally give more opportunities to get behind and around people and surprise them.

They lost the popular vote...and not just by a little.  If anything they proved that the system works exactly as it should.  If you dont win the vote you have an uphill battle.  Cat Lost the pop vote by a lot and barely won the head to head battle despite the advantage of having fewer less skilled players negatively impacting their win rate.

Ive noticed that Japanese players tend to be more skilled to the point that even without the lag I wouldnt typically be the top player like I am matched against NA and EU players. But Im certain of the lag its not usually that crazy teleporting lag just like everyone is a second or so ahead of me. Im sure theyre just as frustrated with me being a lousy addition to their team as I am.Internet traffic from Alaska first gets routed through Washington so I would probably get some additional lag compared to the rest of the Northwest.

4755661,0,t3_3g0qit,The best way to use it is to make your team better. Disrupting foes so you or your team mates can close in for the kill is how to get the job done. Doesnt matter who gets the splat as long as its done. A bomb range up helps disrupt foes from even further away. Only use echo when at least all  enemy squid icons show theyre alive. For best use use it when all  squid icons are alive. More gear suggestions  At least one run speed up helps the gun feel a lot more fluid and its coverage. Consider special saver special charge up and tenacity to help build and maintain echo. ,splatoon,cttzvu9,1,t5_324q4

Its not too hard to avoid ink mines if youre paying attention plus they give you enough of a warning that you can run off swimming to the opposite side of the post from the mine can also protect you from its blast as with all the other explosives. Splash wall being on the tower doesnt necessarily kill or force everyone off either so as long as its not raining on you youre safe. Shooting at it will make it die quicker too. Really if handled properly it shouldnt keep you off the tower more than any mine or bomb.Its when these items are used skillfully or when someone isnt paying close enough attention that theyre dangerous which sounds like how it should be to me.,splatoon,cu0usxj,5,t5_324q4

I think there is other substance. Im not saying I think this is useless over and over I have wrote paragraphs not saying those words.  Its not ironic. Thats the incorrect usage of the word. What youre looking for is hypocritical. But Im not. I think expecting people to play your way and saying only your way is the best way to play is arrogant because it is. Im not saying my way is the best way Im not saying people should only play the way I do or only use my strat I certainly dont mind playing with groups who incorporate other strats.

I find that you can keep yourself calm by having something therapeutic around.

4916681,0,t3_3i5m8h,This is a common gripe and series of arguments but it comes down to a handful of specific bullet points really     Fun is subjective so everyone who plays may not have the same ideas about what is and is not fun. No one players idea of fun supersedes another players. Each player is then encouraged to play in ways that they find to be fun if it happens that playing in and of itself is not fun to them.   If the game is competitive then winning is ultimately what matters above all other considerations. Fun is not a legitimate consideration unless all players agree by consensus on what is or is not fun. If your idea of fun is more narrow than that of the other players it is on you to engage other players in a way that does not artificially restrict their gameplay.   If a given action is a thing that players can do in the game that does not rely on breaking the game somehow it is acceptable and legitimate. If the thing is unbalanced then it will be nerfed but it is acceptable until it is.   Serious play discussions dont entertain cheap douchey cheesy or other disparaging terms in regard to playstyles. Additionally a players credibility and authority are judged by their performance. If you play ranked have a high rank and have a firm grasp of the games mechanics youre qualified to talk about highlevel play in an authoritative way. If you dont play ranked but youre a high level and have played a ton of Turf War you MAY be qualified to talk about highlevel Turf War play.   Anything goes in Turf War. Literally anything because you have nothing to lose in Turf War. Many veteran players use Turf War games for working with weapons that theyre unfamiliar with blowing off steam leveling gear or even just messing around.    Are some ranked players tools? Yup no doubt. Do some people take it way too seriously? Yes definitely. Is it outright rude to talk down to people who are lower ranked than you? Absolutely.    Now is spawn camping a legitimate strategy? It is and has been for a very long time. As a matter of fact its a dangerous and skillintensive highlevel strategy. Especially in Splatoon where there is a dome of invincibility over you when you spawn that your opponents cannot penetrate. But its naive to think about Turf War in terms of only putting down ink. Splatting your opponents puts down your ink wherever you splat them and it also takes away their ability to put down more ink while they respawn. On top of those an opponent whos deep into your side of the map also serves as a super jump point for the rest of the team which makes splatting them even more valuable as a strategy because then youve effectively zoned their team out of a whole section of the map.    By using terms like cheap when talking about other players tactics youre showing that you have a narrower idea of what is fun in the game than they do. Imagine if everyone agreed not to spawn camp each other how would games play out? If one team got pushed back to their spawn what does the other team do then? Theyve inked the rest of the map so do they just squid around and wait for someone to come and contest whichever arbitrary location they happen to be in?    At that point youve given the other team a handicap and thats exactly what it would be. Youd be rebalancing the game in a way that discourages a team from seizing the lead in a game and pushing to the opposing spawn. So what happens then? Players start camping mid instead waiting until the very end of the game to try to create a gap and push through. Now youve conceptually traded a game full of spawncampers for a team full of highleveled Dynamos Tentateks and Krakons that will all try to push through right at the end of the game. Youre trading one situation to gripe about for another.    Something to remember about camping in a specific place is that its never guaranteed to work but its almost guaranteed to work just once. After that if they fool you again shame on you. ,splatoon,cueaa7n,0,t5_324q4

If youre going to devote to one weapon you cant go wrong with the Tentatek Splattershot.  The suctions bombs are very handy and the Inkzooka can take care of pesky snipers once you get good with it.    In turf wars the last minute of the game matters most.  Dont spend the first minute getting every square inch inked on near your basethey may just inkstrike it anyway.  Get to the contested areas and give them hell.  When respawning cover some more area near base or outoftheway areas as you go. Stay alive near the end.    Set a concrete goal for yourself like a  to  splatdeath ratio.  Your teams will be good or bad without you but you can measure your own ability with set numbers like that.,splatoon,cuf1lr5,1,t5_324q4

If you make a terrible ripoff OC like making a green Shadow the Hedgehog and calling him original because he controls plants or something that I can understand. But personally I think well thoughtout characters that could actually fit well in that universe are completely okay. Really I just thought itd be interesting to see how I would fit into the Splatuniverse if I could be an Inkling. Then did thorough research on squids themselves until I found an original species I hadnt seen before and went from there. I do get the idea that Original Character the OChog do not steal can clutter up certain fandoms but from all the Inkling OCs Ive seen out there already I dont think Splatoons headed in that direction. People have done pretty well with whats been given to us through the established universe and I havent seen anything so far that doesnt make much sense.

But to be honest Im just flat out better with a Squiffer and tend to win more with that when I need a ranged weapon.It would be fun to get really good with Rapid Blaster though. I averaged about  splats per game even though we ended up losing each one regardless. Itll take a lot more practice.I find it hard to go aggro with it though. Its absolutely fantastic for stopping an enemy push but its not so good for pushing back in return. How do you go about playing it offensive instead of defensive?,splatoon,cuq6402,2,t5_324q4

Nobody seems to understand that nor the fact that spraying turf is useful to get anywhere.I was playing Rainmaker today and after splatting the other team and inking a path straight to the enemy base for my teammate with the rainmaker he kept standing there shooting at fucking nothing for the next  seconds before someone took him out. This is only the second day Ive been available to play Rainmaker so I refrained initially from picking it up since I suck with Inkzookas. Eventually with a minute left I was just like fuck this. Took the Rainmaker swam through turf I had already inked in preparation on the flank and won the game with no help. My teammates in just about every game were faffing about pretty consistently.

5049299,0,t1_cuu4gu1,Yeah there are definitely some items that are harder to find on others. The reorder strategy is most efficient for  slot gear. The gear isnt very expensive so you buy it and level the first two slots. If the frist two come up with matching subs you add the rd slot. At that point you are paying K or  SSS for a  chance at a perfect peice of gear This is assuming youre going for the favored sub on that particular piece of gear.  With  slot gear he will usually charge you K or so to which you might say why dont I just reroll? It all depends on if he prefilled that first slot for you which he often does. Only needing to fill those second two slots means you have a  chance at perfect gear for K vs rerolling which is a  chance for the same price.With slot gear its still technically cheaper to do the reorder trick but its not as much of a gain and the frustration of adding that rd slot and then it not panning out can be rough haha. Now all that said what this is doing is getting your rolls for cheaper with the tradeoff that because you can only get  thing from Spyke per day it is like you are limited to  reroll per day. If you are generally earning more than K per day with your play then you will start accumulating money and at some point it may make sense to supplement this strategy with straight rerolls.,splatoon,cuumr3w,1,t5_324q4

When I use it I dont care for killsdeath ratio I go on an inking spree and usually get the most turf inked even if my team loses. Only time when I stop moving is when I launch the ink strikes and Im in charge of recovering our turf on our side on every match only when our side is mostly our color then I move forward and try to take big areas to stop the other team recovery. For the ink strike I use it mostly in the middle only using it on their base as a last second attack.

5192839,0,t1_cvbwcc9,You may or may not want to take my tips since I dont use motion controls which is frowned upon around here although I am pretty darn good with my bucket.. Use the sloshers ability to splat over walls to your advantage. This is the best perk of the holy bucket. Head on firefights are something you should avoid. Although the slosher is a HKO its still slower than most shooters. Try ambushing or flanking to attack if you can. Or even hiding in ink.. If you are in a head on firefight one burst bomb  one slosh is better and quicker than  sloshes. It might take a while to remember execute but once you do it will save your squid butt more often than not.. Jump  slosh to cover more turf faster. Swim in your ink to recover your ink tank amd repeat. Its also wise to get to a higher elevation and slosh away.. Select good gear. Although im a firm believer in freshness gtgt perks some of them will benefit your slosher more than others. Ink saver main ink saver sub ink recovery up run speed up are what I would recommend. The slosher can go through your ink tank pretty quick. . Use your inkstrikes wisely. Chances are if you strike near the enemys spawn itll get cover up in a few seconds. I try to strike where I think the enemy is or is heading to or right on my teammates who are engaging the enemy.,splatoon,cvbxig9,11,t5_324q4

5208265,0,t1_cvdrxqw,Yes. It existence and some players extreme proficiency with it and the implicit parallels youre drawing to the TriSlosher dont help its case. This is because The Inkbrush is crazy fast which really helps with flanking and surprising enemies. At least the Inkbrush has Sprinkler for distracting  building special and Inkstrike for zoning. The Inkbrush is quite widely viewed as the worst weapon in the game particularly the Nouveau which has exactly the same issues as the TriSlosher seems like it will poor range a barely offensive sub and the Bubbler. Except the range on the Inkbrush is even worse.Thinking about it the Inkbrush Nouveau should really have Disruptor instead of Ink Mine that would be a cool set.,splatoon,cvdsdqz,2,t5_324q4

Keep your range. Try to get enemies that are a decent amount of distance away in your range but not TOO close. You dont do very well in close combat. Dont miss any shots. Ever or else youre dead. While youre at it dont even use this weapon it will make you really angry. Naw just kidding. This weapon requires practice. It helps your aiming alot. Before you do though practice charger snapping. Thats when you hide your charger laser then pop up and attack the enemy while its charged and they wont ever know what hit them.,splatoon,cvfe2f5,5,t5_324q4

Nintendo always announces a new console at least a year in advance and there was no news of anything coming in .So assuming a new console comes in  Splatoon will still be good until then and even probably a few more years into the new consoles life. By that point it will only be the real dedicated players still going online and matchmaking will probably take quite a while but it would still be playable. Hopefully by the time the game is dying down like that a sequel will be on the horizon to bring the larger community back.These are all major predictions without any evidence so just my own thoughts.,splatoon,cvk6d1n,4,t5_324q4

5312181,0,t1_cvqljpq,On the relatively rare flipside Ive also faced a KrakOn who may have spent too much time defending their Beakons. They got onto the tower on the right overlooking our Splat Zone in Moray and played at least two Beakons over there. Trying out the L Nozzle I went over there to destroy the Beakons but the Roller popped up and splatted me... several times. At least . But they didnt seem to actually be doing much about our Splat Zone considering that we never lost control of it. And the KrakOns teammates didnt jump to his Beakons or to him until the very end....I always miss Beakons when Im not using my Octo. Once in Bluefin Rainmaker I had placed a Beakon on our ledge  middleright exit. The enemy Rainmaker and their team went up that way destroyed the Beakon and progressed up our right side. But I had respawned in time to hit the Beakon before it broke and super jumped to it behind the entire enemy team and splatted the Rainmaker carrier in the back. That was fun.,splatoon,cvqoyty,1,t5_324q4

For the tanks they used a sheet of thin but firmish clear plastic and foldedrolled it into a tube shape. I think they used a bit of glue on the seem which was against their back and then attached the green canister parts which were made out of painted foam. To give the appearance of ink they used a roll of colored posterboard inside of the tank.It probably sounds like craft store garbage from the way Im describing it but it looked seriously legit in person.

5530489,0,t1_cwijhdm,Nearly all  PVC and joints.  Bought  segments of it from Home Depot and just fastened them.  Did a little bit of cutting to make them fit when needed.  Overall the project was pretty simple once I figured out how I wanted to make it.  The bottle is just a  liter with some PVC parts glued together on top.The roller itself is a long roll of bubble wrap also from home depot.  I carefully cut off a bit of the length to make it fit then wrapped it in cloth using spray adhesive.Edit  To add a bit to this if you really want to replicate it.  Get some sand paper and a mini hacksaw for trimming the end of the pipe.  Sanding the entire outside of the pipe is good for spray painting.  You also need some PVC cement which you just swab inside the joints with to fasten the PVC.  It is also good to sand the ends of the pipe and inside of the joints where they come together.As for the bottle it was empty but I dropped in a tiny bit of baking soda and vinegar to make it swell back up to full so I could tightly fasten it but have it still hold its shape.  ,splatoon,cwikhc0,3,t5_324q4

Or a tactic to appeal young male teenagers ? Fact is I have more fun as an adult in Splatoon than super serious AAA games I ve been trying CS GO  Qlive new version and PlanetSide  recently and still go back to splatoon. This Family award  Best Nintendo does not help against this categorization. This award categories make no sense.

5728316,0,t1_cx6zdco,I cannot wait to not play for several days while people try and get sick of this weapon thus sparing myself an endless barrage of what might as well be YET MORE ELITERS.  Let me explain.The weakness of the Hydra Splatling is obvious close range.  If you werent charging then the weapon has no immediate recourse.  If you were charging then you have no mobility and an attacker in close range can use that against you.  But just like with the Eliter the devs shamelessly give the weapon a perfect sub Splat Bombs this time so that it has a solid recourse in CQC anyways and ensure it can remain toptier for all time.  Both these weapons have obscene range greatly benefit from camping for the entire match and have the Echolocator to help them find targets the EZ way.  Watch theyll release this weapon and then well get nothing but Eliter Mall and Eliter Towers on rotation too.  If you do decide to play after release make sure you equip ColdBlooded or prepare to get rekt.I value my sanity so Ill just wait a few days till this madness is over.,splatoon,cx75j6r,-2,t5_324q4
5731294,0,t1_cx67ieg,Hypothetical An enemy is approaching you and you throw a grenade at them and its a direct hit. If its a splat bomb or suction bomb it does nothing and since theyre probably standing in their own ink they can most likely easily escape before it explodes. If its a burst bomb theyre significantly injured and standing in your ink so will have difficulty avoiding your followup attack.,splatoon,cx7iud8,1,t5_324q4
5732175,0,t3_3tn7rc,The design is cool and Im always a fan of the echo locator but Im not liking it so far. Everything about it is too slow and the range doesnt seem to really give you any sort of advantage as far as I can tellIm in the process of testing the range now. Half of my battle time is just charging the dang thing up. Mobility is really bad. And splat bombs? Seriously? I was expecting burst bombs to counteract the Hydra Splatlings inability for close range attacks.  Its like a subpar ELiter.

Hiding on walls waiting for people to walk by is always either the best or worst thing to do be careful. Suction Bombs are hard to use but are useful when you get the hang of it. Beakons are very important. ALWAYS take advantage of them. If you heavily rely on them get at least one main Quick Super Jump. Special chargeSwim Speed up is bae. Kraken OP pls nerf wail is okay great on smaller stages. You dont need damage ups unless you dont want to get close. Quick Respawn is the best too.For DynamosKeep your distance and dont think too much remember where your kill zonedistance is all the time. Spat Bombs are the best thing ever and sprinklers are too sort of. Inkstrike can be useful in any mode and every team should have an Echolocator. Ink saver main is bae. You dont need damage ups to kill whatever you want whenever. Highly recommend quick respawn here too teams can become complacent with the pressure a dynamo can give and let their guard down.I just wanted to give the jist of it didnt want to write an essay.

5774803,0,t1_cxcwtqq,gtI misunderstood the patch notes Nintendo posted then as I assumed damage had been hardcapped not just adjusted to prevent Eliter Squiffers running around.Its one of the fun parts of patch notes  ambiguous phrasing can mean nothing or it can be an oversight from whatever developer  producer got tasked with whacking together a list of changes  In this case however it appears that the absence of the even with gear that increases damage from the ELiter update notes wasnt an oversight.gtI wonder then if this is supposed to be an optional playstyle for the Eliters foregoing other abilities in order to assassinate more forcefully or if Nintendo is overlooking a potential exploit to the weapon.Thats the interesting milliondollar question here. Theoretically theres nothing wrong with allowing an Eliter to splat more forcefully I like that phrasing btw because theyre going to have to optout of a lot of other potentially useful abilities to get there.

Splatoon was designed with these controls in mind so it has a proper button for centering the controls. Without that way to center yourself both with the controller and in game this might be a bit of a pain in the ass. Ill still probably get a steam controller but not for the motion.

5944803,0,t3_3wsshp,Im someone who uses the SSP and sometimes Dual Squelcher both shooters that occupy the range bracket just below the Jet Squelcher.  What the JS and CJS gain in range THEY LOSE IN EVERYTHING ELSE.  Its turf covering is pitiful garbage compared to the lines the SSP lays and one could only ever rank the CJS higher than those if you are at that magic maximum of your range and just outside of theirs.  Maintaining such a distance is difficult to say the least and Chargers often fill roles like that better.Even if you wanted to play a heavy ranged support and camp while firing into the fray safely but you hated Chargers... then the Heavy Splatling and Hydra Splatling both outclass the JS in every way but perhaps not the CJS because its sub and special are both more useful for close combat than any of the Splatling load outs.Ive gone back and tried to enjoy pretty much every weapon now but the JS is Just Shit.,splatoon,cxyw6kq,3,t5_324q4

If you perform poorly itll slowly lower your MMR. When searching for a match it will try to match people of similar MMR.I suspect low levels have a multiplier applied to gainslosses in MMR as on my alt I was matched with ONLY level s almost no level s by the time I hit level .

The idea is that a notinsignificant portion of the highly skilled players will vote first for the side they think will win. If no such clear front runner is obvious the reasoning goes they will perform a sort of internal coin flipone biased in favor of Callies candidate who is always mentioned first in every listing. Choosing a Squid Sister or a symbolic concept is of minor interest to the hypothetical power players.But again the rationale is that were pretty much past that point now.

One point on Hammerhead Bridge my team Past spanned levels  and Future spanned ...they choked us at spawn and that was that. I put up a fight and managed to take two of them out before getting splatted at the middle...but too little too late. I hope their guy with  KD was proud of himself for slaughtering so many hapless younglings.

6262398,0,t1_cz19zk4,Unless future Splatfest results take a turn siding with Callieparticularly in the NA regionhas become the rational choice. Note that Im using the economists rational here. Quote the great wikigtDetermining optimality for rational behavior requires a quantifiable formulation of the problem and making several key assumptions. When the goal or problem involves making a decision rationality factors in how much information is available e.g. complete or incomplete knowledge. Collectively the formulation and background assumptions are the model within which rationality applies.Globally Callie has won  of  Splatfests thus winning . of them. In the NA region she has won  of  Splastfests or . In neither case is a win by Marie surprisinghappening roughly  tries out of  globally and one out of  in the NA region. However let us assume that the odds of a win by Callie are the same as the odds of a win by Marie. This would place Callies odds of winning at  and is the likely goal of the developers.If the odds of Callie winning were actually  and  random trials were run the odds of Callie winning at least  of them are only . .. A binomial distribution with p  .  trials and  successes gives a cumulative probability of .. This means that if thousands of pools of  trials were run we would expect a record as good as or better than Callies  to occur in only about  . of those pools. The assumption underlying this calculationa  chance of Callie winningis therefore likely to be incorrect. Her odds of winning are likely higher. Alternatively one of the assumptions of the binomial distributionthat trials are independentmay be violated as players remember the results of previous Splatfests and align their behavior accordingly. Thus absent data indicating otherwise such as a boycott of Callies team by prominent toptier players or a string of wins by Marie the default assumption for future Splatfests should be Callie will win.What Im still struggling to answer to my own satisfaction is why Callie is doing so well.Edited to correct some numbers.,splatoon,cz1gr73,19,t5_324q4

6280165,0,t3_41k2tw,B is tough because it seems to have a reasonable number of people who have game skills ie they can shoot you but a lot of them are dreadful at strategy. That is they wont get on the fucking tower or they hang back away from the splat zone so they wont get splatted or because they are charging their special or scratching their asses.How to get out of B dont play tower control EVER. You cant carry your team in that mode if you get with a bunch of doofuses who wont get on the tower. Yes you can get a lucky win now and again but it will mostly be more losses than wins. Only play Rainmaker if you are super excellent at picking up the Rainmaker and booking it to the end. Be very cautious playing splat zones try to avoid the maps where there are  zones because your dumbass teammates will mostly be doing WTF ever when you grab one zone and then you go grab the other one and in the meantime the enemy has the first one back again. Port Mac and Moray are THE WORST for this.You want to play splat zones on maps with one zone. Why? Because this maximizes your ability to drag your team to the goal and they can only do so much to fuck that up for you. Your approach has to be that you are going to carry the team. They can probably splat opponents who are not that smart so focus your attention on doing the stuff they dont do. Take out the snipers. This is super important. A lot of B players wont take out the sniper and this makes it hard to control the zone. Make sure you are covering the zone as much as possible. If you have to kill people to do it do that but dont get distracted getting splats. Let your teammates chase down guys who are acting as decoys. Keep right on top of the objective all the time.Remember this is not about getting the most kills although you might do that its about keeping the team focussed on the objective. The last  seconds are super critical in matches where you appear to be winning too. As an AA playing in B lobbies I have noticed they tend to lose focus at the end if we are winning and that can let the other team in. Obvs if you are losing dont give up at the end you might squeak a win.,splatoon,cz3hg9a,2,t5_324q4

6352910,0,t1_cz9v05v,Thanks for doing the math. Following your asumptions and considering it is true to believe that the inkling calendar still has  weeks there still one little dettail from cannon.The scrolls says the human skeleton is dated  years. The tricky part is human years or inkling years?If we asume that inklings rediscovered earth rotation we can be confident that an inkling year has less days than the human caledar. Thus the  year canon is subject to the relativity of the measure of time. Give me some spare time and I can come with a regression model to calculate the actual lenght of the inkling calendar compared to the human one.,splatoon,czbr7g3,1,t5_324q4

Transitioned to the OctoBrush because I wanted something speedier and I got some gear that had a few DMG UPs on it that I liked.

6447513,0,t3_43zia6,Motion controls give you some of the same advantage that a mouse gives you over an analog stick. An analog stick only lets you control the velocity of your aiming reticle while motion controls or a mouse let you control its position directly. Its much easier to be good with motion controls and the ceiling of how good you can become is much higher. Its particularly critical for sniping snapping your shots hiding your laser from your target until the moment you shoot is practically impossible without motion controls.,splatoon,czm7oc2,3,t5_324q4

6459915,0,t3_44536a,Your gear is good but Id swap the shoes for orange lotops or black seahorses squid girl shoes look dumb that aint fresh. Swim speed up will be more beneficial for you with escaping the enemy. Octobrush is about playing smart and using your flank. Its better to stay alive than it is to trade splats with someone. You have to be aggressive but also pragmatic. Most people will outrange you but you have a quick timetokill count if you catch them by surprise and utilize the ink coverage. If youre about to splat someone and theyre able to get some ink on you? Retreat. Its not worth it to keep pushing to be splatted due to tunnel vision. Your ink coverage is great enough that you should be able to zip around the side and get them later with just a few seconds of patience.Also never underestimate the benefit of covering turf! You have insane coverage and can coat the field for your teammates much faster than most so every now and then take the time to do it!,splatoon,cznhy7t,4,t5_324q4

6475214,0,t1_czp0yuc,Yeah its definitely harder on some levels definitely the smaller levels or levels with tight areas. You really have to work hard on keeping the distance and knowing where you can and cant go. Ive done well with it in piranha pit and I like saltspray it can be good to hit people camping the battlements during splat zones. And I like it a lot in the big open ceenters of Mahi Mahi. I had assumed it would be good in moray towers with its ability to hit people on the tiers above or below and to shoot people down a ramp from you. But I was playing yesterday and I had a lot of trouble its just not fast enough to deal with a hard flank from a tentatek or sploosh and you still have to watch out for Eliters. Im hoping to try it in a few hours for rainmaker walleye and kelp dome and see how that goes. I think I remember having success at walleye but Im not sure about kelp dome. Im hoping it will work well to harass the sniper spots but i guess we will have to see.,splatoon,czp30n0,1,t5_324q4

6724661,0,t1_d0eme1d,if you like to splat try the splattershot either version. its better at splatting people IMO than the splattershot jr but has a similar feel to it so its not totally foreign to you. either that or use something that has bubbler or kraken so you can charge it up then go splat the entire other team LOL. trislosher is fun you dont need to aim as much and its great for close combat kills plus one of the versions has a bubbler! Nzap takes longer to get used to because it takes more hits to kill but it inks like a maniac. i get pretty good kills with it i just have to remember to stay back a little instead of rushing right in for the kill. also when i feel discouraged or bored i try an entire new weapon. killing with rollers via flicking just pressing ZR instead of holding it is so much fun plus they are so fun to play with in turf war because they are good at inking too. buckets are one of my favorites both slosher  trislosher because they have amazing ink output and pretty high damage. plus when i am tired of trying to aim with shooters these guys let me play more loosely but still get splats. ,splatoon,d0evzq3,1,t5_324q4

6729359,0,t1_d0etko8,Thanks for a really detailed reply!Youre very right especially about the bugs which I completely forgot to mention. They have fixed a lot of them but definitely not all.Personally I find lag is rarely an issue but its very obvious when it is. Ive yet to invest in a Wii U LAN adapter but Ive read it makes a world of difference.The rotation of modes and maps can be annoying for those of us who just want to stick to our comfort zones but by ensuring everyone is participating in the same modes and maps at the same time it probably makes it much easier to find players online to fill the teams and encourages people to try new things which could just as easily be viewed as a drawback.What do you mean by no legitimate match making? Do you find youre matched with incompatible team mates or is it the lack of matchmaking options that you dislike?I havent actually played any of the games you listed Im one of those weird people who only owns Nintendo gaming devices but Ive watched Lets Plays for Fallout  Witcher  Metal Gear Solid  and Bloodborne and even just from watching I have to agree with you.

6737815,0,t1_d0g7pdo,The . deco definitely takes skill to do well with. Ive been playing a lot of it lately and there are definitely tricks to learn. The problem with it is the HUGE RNG element to the shots which lets you cheese kills at max range you really have no business getting just because you had good RNG. At the same time though you can sometimes get robbed of kills you deserve at shorter ranges.You definitely need to be a good player to do consistently well. Finding the optimal range to space shots is tricky with it since its so much shorter than the actual max range. I do concede though luck can carry you at times. I wish they would just cut that max range the weapon can cheese at and make it more accurate along mid range.,splatoon,d0g8y9b,0,t5_324q4

6756542,0,t1_d0i5hzk,Stacking abilities can be very powerful for certain weapons even taking into account the diminishing returns. So it can be very beneficial to put a lot of stock into one or two abilities that help you a lot as opposed to putting an equal amount into several abilities that would help you some. For example the splooshomatic is a weapon that you want to play very fast so you can outmaneuver other players. So if you are using the sploosh you might want to get all your abilities in swim and run speed which will help you a lot as opposed to using something like ink saver main which would help but isnt something the sploosh really needs. Also certain weapons have thresholds that abilities can take advantage of. Like using Eliter with the equivalent of  mains and  subs of damage up you can do  damage per uncharged tap against a player not running any defense so that would be a quick two tap kill. Some weapons like the rapid blaster rapid blaster pro and bamboozler cant kill in one direct shot. But if you stack enough damage up you can make a shot do . damage to a player not running any defense. This means if the player has any damage on them at all or is even standing in your teams ink it becomes a one shot kill.,splatoon,d0i6llh,2,t5_324q4

You might as well be gaining the large amounts of experience that you get from a Ranked win while also honing your ranked skills.That said if you dont like Ranked just shoot for as much inking as possible but keep in mind that the more enemies you kill and that dont kill you the more time youre out there to ink. Thats also the same mentality you need for Ranked btw survive and keep pushing the objective which is inking turf in Turf Wars.P.S. I like Turf more than Ranked but I definitely wish Id started playing Ranked earlier because so many experience points are going to waste.

6841724,0,t3_46049l,A and ranking up Slosher Deco user here. I play it different than the other post and very different than Vanilla Slosher. Still doing rerolls but my gear is Tenacity then ink saver and special up  swim speeds but I plan to convert it over to more ink saver and special up asap. I only use splash wall in rare situations like quick intercepting a tower. I believe take advantage of all the subtleties within the context of my playstyle gear deco set. Im always using all the strats based on situation switching up my approach constantly. My gear serves to let me get to Kraken mode asap. My strats arent just  different but I add a lot of turf control psychology predict and dont be predicted and speed and reflexes. I push the paint control the movement and go for overall team success over personal kdr not that it tends to be bad but not as good as when I used luna blaster. I set the sensitivity to max so that I can change directions fast. My aim with chargers might suck but I spin and stop with an aim good enough for the slosher shot to land. I dance around like someone taking the rainmaker to the goal in the middle of a losing firefight I actually do that a lot. I use the delay of dropping ink to control players by making them unable to safely move to one side with enough time to fire more shots that do that same thing. I tend to both die and kill at a lower rate normally I am around  kills  deaths in a full length match.Against short range weapons I time the kraken to save my life and stop them from escaping. Against chargers I am will to use it just to get close if I have to as my dancing and prediction ability amplifies the edge the weapon already has. Against mid range weapons I kind of dance my way and just kraken when I feel their aim almost getting good enough. Or sooner if there is also a sniper. Because I push the map paint and charge up my kraken I have some paint strats. I always remember that my paint does damage so I rapidly assess the situation before painting instead of during. I usually flank spam with my back to our color but if we are severely out painted or I have snuck in there base on my own I aim about  degrees up hold the joystick sideways and spam the trigger. The attention this draws tends to work in my favor as it quickly builds up my kraken meter  If  forced into a more straight up in the open fight I am spinning and shooting and swimming like a mad man. At best I have won and survived a  on  but not often. Sometimes teammates come in and sometimes I am such a distraction that even if I die and dont get killed its more than worth it. I get in those situations most often when my super meter is low and there much ink push need or opportunity and running the clock is top priority but sometimes I get stuck fighting that way and sometimes they own the ink and it still works. I hope this helps or gives people some ideas for either weapon. Even if my exact setup isnt for everyone there might be some takeaways? The delay of gravity on a falling ink arc is powerful if you move and think fast enough.Please note that while some things I say might disagree I am not saying I dont utilize other slosher aspectsstrats already mentioned. I mix in everything that I can no burst bombs especially since prediction and unpredictability is my game.,splatoon,d0rtc73,2,t5_324q4

However Im still carryng the RM if no teammate is close but sometimes they all rush ahead leaving me alone with a hidden enemy that they did not see so I keep shooting slow and steady trying to kill him while they all are spamming Cmon to me from the other side of the map.Idk maybe this happened to Ben or maybe he needs to understand that there are better players to push the RM who knows?,splatoon,d0xivkq,2,t5_324q4

6940557,0,t1_d130stt,I actually like the idea of Echolocator on shorter range weapons and you chasing down the opponents opposed to sniping them off from a distance. And sadly TriSlosher Nouveau is probably the only weapon with Echolocator that can do this decently. The other two short range weapons with Echolocator Custom Splattershot Jr and NZap  are too slow and unreliable to do this.So the Echolocator on the Tri Slosher Nouveau is a higher risk higher reward scenario than with the Bubbler on the vanilla TriSlosher. The problem mostly with the TriSlosher Nouveau is that there are other weapons that can function like it Splooshomatics Carbon roller but not as many weapons that functions like the normal TriSlosher with its safe ambush options with the Disruptor and the Bubbler.,splatoon,d131i4r,2,t5_324q4

6961803,0,t3_4b20md,Alrighty so For context there are  spinning towers with elevated platforms on the map.  is in the center and each team basically has  towers each that fall into their territory one closer to the center of the map and a smaller one closer to the spawn. Total .The enemy team can very easily get to your spinning tower that is closer to the center. Its big and connects directly to the center tower. Now using one of the platforms on that tower they can jump over a ledge and onto a smaller stationary platform close to your teams other spinning tower the one that is close to your spawn. This ledge will be to your left as you get closer to the enemy spawn if youre riding a platform on the spinning tower. Now at this point if youre the enemy team it looks like youve hit a dead end. You cant get any higher than the platform youre on since all of the walls in front of you have ledges that stop you from going up and over and the smaller spinning tower has the same type of ledges. However this smaller spinning tower is rotating with  walls extended kind of like a fan all of which can be painted and do not have ledges stopping you from going up and over. From the stationary platform that you initially jumped to from the other spinning tower see previous paragraph you can paint those moving walls jump towards one when it gets close go squid right as you make contact and latch onto your paint. From here you can swim up and over and voila youre on top of the smaller tower with access to the enemy spawn. It sounds more complicated than it actually is. Its just about timing your jumps right. Its also not entirely practical unless no one is there to guard the base. Youll be jumping around and waiting a lot... an easy target. But its fun to try!,splatoon,d15gfjk,3,t5_324q4

The burst from the shield would almost always guarantee a killer wail ready to use. Most of the time if that wail popped the shield it would net another wail ready to use immediately after.

7062909,0,t1_d1gwxdj,Burst cancel probably wont be as bad as it is with Carbon ew.A burst bomb can be anywhere from  to ish damage and an Inkbrush unboosted is  damage. With a bit of damage boosting yeah you could probably hit KO... But thats assuming a direct hit which a Carbon almost never gets. In reality itd probably be more along the lines of three hits which puts it along the same lines for killspeed as an Octobrush.If you stack enough damage up and happen to get a direct hit then yeah easy Hit KO  per main times Three mains   damage boost . times   . for burst bombs  times .  . for an Inkbrush hit. .  .  . more than enough to kill . Im not sure how Splatoons inate hitsperKO factors in for this so only testing will show how it actually works... But it looks like another weapon will be a viable burstcanceler. That makes . Uh oh!The scary thing about the Inkbrush is that their specials have ALWAYS been great with their main weapon.

Yes its him blowing hot air out of his mouth and making empty promises but he really should have known better than to suggest religious ID badges.The mexican wall statements are grandiose nonsense. The they send over rapists part is factually untrue as most illegal immigants avoid comitting crimes like murder rape and so on minor theft I believe is the most commonly committed crime in that group because if they get caught breaking the law in a country theyre not supposed to be in they get in much more trouble. So that accounts for the racism accusations.The sexism stuff is the usual SJW nonsense. Though him calling his daughter attractive and saying hed date her is a bit creepy Im aware he didnt mean it in the incesty way but it dosnt stop it from being off putting.Hes actively offered to pay for lawyers and legal fees of people who assault protesters at his ralleys while saying he doesnt condone such activities bit two faced there.Hes no antichrist but hes a pretty big asshole who really needs to learn to think before he speaks.On a more on topic note.

7130661,0,t3_4d7zag,As a sloshing machine player I dont see why anyone would use the neo over the default. Generally the inkzooka is great for taking on people on ledges or behind walls but thats already the sloshing machines greatest strength. Point sensors are nice because the sloshing machine relies heavily hitting enemies who are out of sight but not having a bomb means that your options for applying pressure and dealing with rushdown weapons are greatly reduced. ,splatoon,d1oocz5,2,t5_324q4
7138650,0,t3_4dc212,It depends on what weapon you are playing. That is a lot of attack up abilities and having so many is really only useful on a few weapons. Its great for the Eliter bamboozler the rapid blasters and maybe the splat chargers. That much damage can help the charger weapons kill without fully charging and will help the rapid blasters indirect and direct shots do more damage. As for defense up I think for it to really be beneficial you need at least a main or maybe four subs. I think  subs would help but defense is definitely something that benefits from more stacking.,splatoon,d1pl59f,1,t5_324q4

Besides aiming and reflexes theres also knowledge of the metagame availablepopular tactics amp strategies good spatial awareness good decisionmaking how to support your team mates this one is super important IMO and generally leads to a much more enjoyable Splatoon experience for everyone etc.Like I remember seeing so many people going on about ELiters and Dynamos. Those two weapons among others have a very hard time inking walls in general not so much vanilla ELiter thanks to burst bombs more so Custom. The veterans have their own optimized ways of doing so but in general its always helpful when the better weapon for the job helps out.All these improvements take time and for some people it might be easier due to their gaming background or mental approach.Pardon me for the relatively long comment!

Octobrush happens to have all of them... But alas your weapons only have some of them.Id prioritize an inking weapon Probably the Dynamo. Ink first push foward later. Whenever you get the zone always cover the opponents side in ink to delay them and to get your specials back. Be weary of any opponent that may climb around on your left side at any point in the game especially the beginning.

Range does mean a lot but weapons with more range still have drawbacks. Look at the Jet Squelcher for example it may have the longest range of any shooter but it has poor ink coverage a bad TTK and slower rate of fire still a great weapon though.

You know theyre out there and theyre gonna rise from the inky abyss to get you before you can react... providing youre not safe in your own ink. So in matches versus a good Carbon user I prioritise safe plays and strong turf coverage.ampnbspEliters in specific matchups on specific maps. I do appreciate what they bring to the game but depending on the map and team composition some matches are just writeoffs  most recently I had a SZ Triggerfish game our entire team was closerange shooters... there was an Aerospray a TriSlosher two other short range guns. Theirs was a Zink Mini a Hydra and two eliters. They had total map control  we couldnt get close. It was incredibly embarrassing. Not that that was the fault of the eliters as such but eliters tend to cause that kind of matchup more often than other weapons. Im still glad they exist though.ampnbsp. gals have remained on my i hate this weapon list for so long thatd Ive actually stopped mentioning them since its assumed. Their TTK is just crazy.E but forget all of the above and replace it with anything with bubbler and a fast charge time because my internet does not have a great ping and I swear getting those two key slosher shots in only to have a delayed bubbler appear happens every second match lately.

8119672,0,t1_d4smjko,museum is rough and any slip ups can lead to a reversal but i tend to do well by alternating between three spots if we gain the leadthe first is obviously the top of the spinning thing. you can get shots on almost anywhere and itll take a moment for even strong opponents to work their way to you in which case youre not far from safety in your base.the second is your teams square keeping an eye out for flanks since everybody else is focused on monkeying around the enemy base. i dont tend to get a lot of splats here but even just forcing opponents to take the main route and abandon their flank is a victory.the third is the most fruitful to me which is the enemys square facing their base. i get a lot of jump shots here of the enemy base. a lot of people try to work their way around the back and a lot of snipers try to get some range on your team by standing on the spinner.your extra vulnerable to ambushes on this stage though so im frequently moving around,splatoon,d4sq2o7,1,t5_324q4

8140021,0,t1_d4v13ro,Im a gameplay only type of person.The dungeons in Twilight Princess left a bad taste in my mouth.  The only redeeming one was Temple Of Time which I would place just behind Stone Tower Temple as the greatest dungeon sequence in Zelda.However the number of oneoff items in TP was at its peak. It was trying way too hard to be Ocarina Of Time v.. The collection quests were lackluster Zant could have been fleshed out better said as a gameplay only person.I was overhyped for TP and it really undersold. It took a while for it to set in it wasnt until about a week after I beat it that I realized that I didnt really enjoy it all that much.  Now the benefit of this is that I went into Skyward Sword with negative expectations.And I fully understand the complaints of linearity in the game as well as the complaints about Fi and Im not dismissing those.Skyward Sword is my favorite Zelda game behind Majoras Mask. The dungeon design in Skyward Sword is absolutely phenomenal nearly every single dungeon sequence everything from the previous dungeon boss to the next looked at discretely is nearly on par with the quality brought by Stone Tower Temple.I loved the stealth elements introduced in Skyward Sword as well. Stealth and Zelda games werent something that I thought could go hand in hand but SS made it work in universe. I know I know. I said gameplay only.Anyway. . .tldr Twilight Princess was overhyped.,splatoon,d4v1r09,4,t5_324q4

Yes swim speed does affect your bomb throws and yes swim speed will make your bomb go farther if your bomb throw is swimming forward and pressing the button.  This is however irrelevant because swimming forward and jumping this is called power throwing makes the bomb go even further because swim speed does not affect your speed while jumping even if you get a running start.Its definitely worth investigating if a sub or two of swim speed could give me access to some specific throws but my experience in general is that power throwing is always a better option than investing into swim speed.,splatoon,d6tkv3w,2,t5_324q4

9077110,0,t3_54lcij,i main the heavy splatlings but i honestly dont remember how i deal with snipers.  Ill try it tonight and pay attention for a decent response.EDIT alright my thoughts after a few matches . If you are far from the sniper try to take cover behind objects and ignore them as you do your thing.  You cant outrange them effectively. . If youre actively trying to take down a sniper a. Preferred choice Sneak up on them.  Try to take them from behind or their sides where they cant see you. b. Less safe choice Frontal attack  Get in MEDIUM range of them.  Example some guns and rollers need to get CLOSE to get a chance to splat which causes snipers to spaz out since theyre usually horrible at upclose fighting.  Against other snipers they play chicken from FAR to see who can splat their target first.  For the Heavy Splatlings get in close enough that your furthest shot goes just beyond the sniper.  They will be forced to take time to charge their shot if they want a chance to get you.  This is exploiting both your long range and faster charge time.  Helps if you can find an obstacle to hide behind to charge your shot and keep peeking after they shoot so you can get them while theyre charging.,splatoon,d82x6iy,1,t5_324q4

Maintaining a solid rank is a much more accurate assessment of individual player skill just because of how win streaks are basically required to rank up. If Player A goes W W L W W L W and Player B goes L L W W W W W Player B might rank up while Player A doesnt even though they had the same win rate.ugleepglap is correct though  over time given a large enough sample size of matches where random factors are evened out the only common factor in these games is you. Other players who do manage to rank up are facing these same interferences.Its important to remember that in order to rank up you need to perform consistently better than your fellow players. If youre not carrying via top KD or smart objective play the majority of games youre actually sitting at the correct rank. And thats a good thing!

If its just become an obsession to get to S or something and you dont think you will maybe its time to move on. In the end having fun is the reason to play. Edit I am not an S and I never will be. I just accepted that fact quite sometime ago. If I find myself getting too obsessed with the points in ranked battles I usually put down ranked for a while and just play turf wars. Its a little more relaxing for me. Edit  wow there were a lot of dictation typos in that last edit by Siri,splatoon,dcmwuqs,4,t5_324q4
10404779,0,t1_dcmy6bb,gtActually the biggest difference I find is that S players are better about reacting to taking hits and escaping before getting splatted.A big part of that and protecting yourself from flanks is map awareness and map control. Just make sure you ink everything in your free time and make sure you check the map every now and again if you have a moment to breathe.

10459393,0,t1_dctjuyl,I didnt really think very much about how things would work before the game released though I remember always thinking Roller looked amusing and fun as hell to use. In the early stages of the metagame Splat Rollers mostly could get away with rolling all day because nobody could aim in general and a lot of longerranged weapons werent released yet. Im speaking from experience btw I played the first month as a Splat Roller.Most people also hadnt fully understood how Dynamo should be played when they first got their hands on it people started rolling with it at first heck even nowadays some Dynamo users roll with it in some really odd situations by which I mean at times when they shouldnt be What Im getting at is things changed over time thanks to the dripfeed release of weapons maps balance updates etc. and as much as some people want to believe strictly turfing alone wont get you anywhere. It still contributes heavily if you know what youre doing but someone on your team is generally going to have to do some killing so that your team can maintain an advantage in turf control.Anyway like I mentioned to another poster give Splat Roller a try its fun and still requires quite a bit of skill to perform with and when played well is very rewarding too! youll most likely come out of the experience with a different outlook on Rollers.,splatoon,dctoeuh,1,t5_324q4
10459516,0,t1_dct2dc3,Oh if you feel the Dynamo can be oppressive in many situations thats certainly true and I can relate to that. Not being able to roll effectively is still a penalty regardless of the strength of its flicking. I mean memes aside the Dynamo isnt literally killing you from halfway across the map.I see you use the  gal the penalty is requiring  hits as compared to OHKO weapons and also your range and turfing ability isnt the best but it kills faster than almost any other weapon in the game so none of those are penalties by your logic.,splatoon,dctowyv,6,t5_324q4

10799314,0,t3_5ufvvk,Well since youve obviously played a lot of ranked you know how to play the objective so thats already going to put you miles above the average nb. There is most certainly no ink just press R to reload. You are of course unable to shoot while reloading. Only one character Sombra has stealth capabilities and only one character Mercy can fly to teammates. Character customization is strictly cosmetic and two people playing the same character will always have functionally identical stats and weapons.There are currently  different characters separated into  categories Offense Defense Tank Support. For the most part the roles of those categories are DPS area denial tank and healer. There are exceptions such as Symmetra in support who can grant shields but not heal and Junkrat in defense who can often top the DPS charts. Recognizing the characters by their silhouettes becomes important as you play so that you may adjust your team to better combat the other team. Oh yeah you can switch your character midgame from a spawn area!Going into each character in depth would  be a bit much for this post so heres a link to the official heroes page.Playing competitive games with friends is by far easier to pull off in Overwatch. You just add your friends to a group. The end. Just in case you are not familiar with competitive play ingame chat it is the reason why the ESRB has that lovely notice Game experience may change during online play. This is sometimes a massive understatement. If anyone gets downright belligerent report and move on dont give them too much attention.Treat control point maps like tower maps except the tower doesnt move and you go for a timebased win. Spawns will remain in their constant locations and you hold the map center. Similar strategies can be employed here. Some on some off the point towards incoming enemiesTreat payload maps like a mix of rainmaker and tower but one teams objective is specifically to stop the other from pushing instead of moving forward themselves. Spawns will move up attackers and back defenders as the cart passes checkpoints. The cart will only move when attacking players are very close and no defenders are in the same range.Arcade mode has the v deathmatch  v  duel capture the flag soon and a whole slew of bizarre game modes called brawls. Outside of v and v the overall mood in Arcade is far more casual.All cosmetic collectables are found in lootboxes or bought from the customization menu via credits. You will be rewarded one lootbox per level up and  per week via arcade mode wins  per box. Occasionally lootboxes will drop piles of credits and any duplicate rewards will grant credits as well. I would suggest not buying nonevent related cosmetics and saving up your credits for events. The normal cosmetics can be found at any time while the event ones are not only three times more expensive but only around for a limited time. Finally dont buy any event cosmetics until the end of the event draws near. Murphys law would suggest that the  credit skin you just bought will be in the next lootbox you open. I personally got every Chinese New Years cosmetic without purchasing any lootboxes although it was a scramble for those last few sprays. Of course if youre not an insane person like me who must have everything just grab what you like when you like.As for story that is all in the cinematics and comics. Anything happening in the game is noncanon. ,splatoon,ddtveom,16,t5_324q4

Because of that and because of the Squiffer requiring even a short time to charge the inklings assaulting you will just pop in and out of their ink to confuse your aim waiting for either the Bubbler to dissipate or your charge to be released ineffectually.No the Bubbler does seem to require a weapon capable of throwing out some quick ink in such emergencies otherwise it just buys you time to superjump back to base. The Kraken of the Fresh Squiffer gives you that important crisis management tool along with the ever handy Suction Bomb.

Theyre giving players more options to utilize in game.Besides the rollers speed boost they can choose to either standing flick or jump flick both with their own type of attack and situation. Chargers are able to hold their charges for a brief amount of time allowing snipers to have more evasive options and deal with pressure more effectively.And the dualies roll looks to be great for mixing up opponents aim and timing.God this game looks so good so far.,splatoon,deamsfd,8,t5_324q4
10965244,0,t3_5wl0dm,Havent played in a long time but heres a bucket list of stuff to look for from my experience. Practice practice practice. Shooting range lets your practice techs and other stuff and then in turf war practice on live targets. Dont give any damns about winning or losing in turf because your primary goal is to practice.. Knowledge Know your sniping points and weapon matchups. Sniping points is basic sniper knowledge but know your weapons matchup against several other weapons. Get a general sense of how far some weapons can shoot so if facing them you know how to effectively deal with said weapon.. Objective The main goal of the sniper is to protectsupport the team by providing paths and eliminating all possible threats before they present themselves. Even if you cant land the kill and have to go  if you ward off the enemy enough and harass them then youre doing the job right. Ive seen many a horror story where squids try to go  with snipers and have costed their team the game due to just trying to rack up kills. OBJECTIVE COMES FIRST. Get the zonetowerrainmaker and push the objective while protecting your team.. Perseverance Dont falter in your decisionmaking do not be intimidated by sudden ambushes that kill you and most of all keep a clear mind. Never go on tilt with a sniper as the sniper is a weapon that requires the most out of the player in terms of cool collected calculation. Keep calm support the team know when to push and retreat. Snipers are the lifeline of the team and your perseverance is the most important element needed.. Let experiences from other games flow in. Fighting games like Smash teach stage positioning subconscious decision making etc. in a different context. Other shooters let you hone your skills outside of Splatoon. Let these experiences flow into your gameplay and vice versa as these lessons can be molded to fit the situation youre stuck in.,splatoon,deazkdx,11,t5_324q4

11324501,0,t3_61mg0u,You really have to consider match times compared to other shooters. Splatoon is probably the most fast paced shooter and with shortest match times. There are way less ebbs and flows in Splatoon like in for instance Overwatch that allow for weapon switching. ,splatoon,dffm3fv,11,t5_324q4

11377613,0,t1_dfkozio,On the YouTube front definitely.With nontransferring VC games I think their idea is that theyll lose money if they make them transferable. However so many new customers are buying Switches that I dont think it will be a huge cut into their profits. It makes even less sense now. Theres also the issue of certain titles not being possible on the Switch like Wii and DS games,splatoon,dflmtes,1,t5_324q4

11404486,0,t3_62cg4f,Theres no official word on it yet but I would assume theyll do another one given how they did something similar when Splatoon  came out. Maybe about a month or even two weeks before launch theyll do another testfire? You know just to get everybody on the hype train and talking about it. Just my thoughts tho.,splatoon,dfoomwn,2,t5_324q4

11435706,0,t1_dfs5j6g,It seems like theyre going for a more subdued colour scheme of a lot of stages. Maybe they want a contrast between the nonpainted areas and painted ones perhaps?

11498429,0,t1_dfz8166,I mean... I guess but I really think this is in large part a case of you having inflated expectations. Its a loading screen minigame. Ill grant that the sync issues should be fixed they dont have to be as good in this as they do in a full game but Ill grant that theyre currently too broken to be enjoyed but a real scoring mechanism would honestly be annoying. Rhythm games in my experience really depend on getting into the groove. You cant do that when youre constantly yanked away at arbitrary times to play a match. At most Id expect a hitmiss counter nothing more. Also this one was no good they should never try to improve on it is just a weird sentiment in general. ,splatoon,dfzchkk,2,t5_324q4

11779939,0,t3_682xjk,Well the short answer is yes you should definitely get it if youre this interested Im sure you will have a good time with it.The longer answer is that yes sometimes you will be paired with higher level players. There are two modes for online play in Splatoon turf wars and ranked matches. Turf wars are kind of a free for all there are some algorithms in place to try to pair you with players of your skill level but they are far from perfect and you will often end up playing with some better players. But the good news is turf wars are the more casual mode. There really isnt anything to lose so most people play turf wars to try new weapons and just kind of mess around.Then there are ranked modes which are objective based and more competitive. These let you raise or lower your rank based on whether you win or lose matches. This is great because you will almost always be playing with people in your skill level. And as you get better you will naturally rank up to higher levels of play.,splatoon,dgval1d,8,t5_324q4
