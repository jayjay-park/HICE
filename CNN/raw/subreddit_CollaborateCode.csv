Why not?edit frontend typically means html css and javascript. It might include extensions of these such as jquerylesssasswhatever. Im not familiar with scripting but I have a lot of programming experience and its definitely worth learning.,CollaborateCode,chez1ca,2,t5_2xdr0

Its great that I can make a web page what do I make tho or great I can make an app what do I make. Biggest thing is I cant seem to figure how to go from here is a function that does x to a full blown application. ,CollaborateCode,chezpcx,1,t5_2xdr0

It all comes back.Happy baking!,CollaborateCode,ckh32vq,1,t5_2xdr0
