7357624,0,t3_4g3uk9,If the problem is the same across the registers then the pads open too far. Take it to a skilled repair tech tell them thise pads are disgustingly out of tune and would like them redone. When he or she is done bring a tuner and test it there so yhey can make any final adjustments.Also E F and F are generally a hair sharp. I cant remember why at the moment but its how it is.
