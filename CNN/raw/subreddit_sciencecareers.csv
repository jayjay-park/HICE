3127081,0,t3_2vyzwk,For an academic career the name of the school matters A LOT! If you dont go to a T school then the reputation of your advisor is what matters.  For the industry route then I think it may be a little more up in the air.  Here is a posting from chemjobber   Basically you need to go to a school where YOU can be the most successful while giving yourself opportunities to make those all important connections.  Those can come at conferenceslocal events like local ACS chapters and recruiting days at your university.,sciencecareers,com4c84,3,t5_2u6fx

Biochemistry environmental chemistry chemical engineering  that seems to best fits your interests. If all you have is a general notion that you like the field as a whole focus on getting as much experience in the lab as possible and test out the ones that you can while building up a strong base skill set that can be easily specialized at a later date.   The one biggest regret I have from getting my B.S. at a small school is that the facultys research interests were limited so look into that topic before you decide on a school. ,sciencecareers,df46xnf,1,t5_2u6fx
