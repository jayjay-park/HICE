Even if the light being emitted from the orange was extremely dim  hours..? I would think maybe  minutes tops. Maybe theres something Im not currently educated about that Im missing.

11383105,0,t1_dfltwn2,There is a perfectly real reason most of the western world believes that the only dignified thing to do with dead people is fill them with formaldehyde and put them in a  box.I mean apart from everyones fear of turning into nothing. The funeral industry perpetuates the idea that burning the dead traditional in many other cultures is somehow disrespectful.  Instead pay them a shitload of money to taxedermy them so everyone can look at them for  minutes before burying them along with a super expensive box.The last time I saw my father he was alive.  Why anyone would want their last memory of their loved ones to be a lifeless doll in a box being lowered into the ground is beyond me.The worst part for me us that as soon as it rains the coffin fills with water.  Then person soup.The funeral industry is fucking disgusting and everyone falls for it.,MostBeautiful,dfm97q9,2,t5_37oez
