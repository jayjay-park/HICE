10794194,0,t3_5suk8f,Time crystals are able to move without containing any sort of energy which gives the illusion it is perpetual motion because well actually it is. A Zero energy state that is still moving. This allows the crystal to be used as a clock like crystal oscillators currently being used. This is where the Time part of the Time crystal nomenclature comes from.This will be used to count the time in electron computers and eventually in Quantum computers to keep the programming lines from over lapping each other and causing the computer to fail.It has nothing to do with Time travel.,time_travel,ddtcety,1,t5_2x32e
