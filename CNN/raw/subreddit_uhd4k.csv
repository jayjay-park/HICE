9788025,0,t3_5fe4ba,Nvm it looks like I found the answer.  Angry Birds is from Sony Pictures and I found this on the Sony Pictures websitegtIf you are redeeming an UltraViolet code from a Sony Pictures K UHD disc you will be granted the K UHD right and will be able to stream in K with the ULTRA K Movies and TV app available on  Sony BRAVIA K Android TVs. Please note that you will only be able to stream up to HD quality on SonyPicturesStore.com downloads are only in SD.Thus it is only a k digital copy if redeemed directly through them and you can only access it on their newer tvs. ,uhd4k,dajl55l,1,t5_368vj
