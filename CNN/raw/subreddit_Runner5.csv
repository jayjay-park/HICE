111203,0,t3_1vaq9z,Great! Hope it fixes My issue with the walk not tracking my activity correctly.,Runner5,cer3d9o,2,t5_2tn3u
608632,0,t3_213y7j,I havent found a download all feature but it sure would be nice. I just tend to download them one at a time in  mission increments. ,Runner5,cg9gd09,4,t5_2tn3u
748419,0,t3_22poak,Not sure about other devices but in IOS there is a Shuffle option when choosing your playlist in the mission selection menu underneath the Start Mission button. You can also turn on Distance and Time notifications by tapping More then Settings.,Runner5,cgpco56,2,t5_2tn3u
751447,0,t3_22quda,No AFAIK. What Ive done is to reset the whole base so I dont lose materialssupplies and rebuild the whole thing at once.,Runner5,cgpp2an,5,t5_2tn3u
866101,0,t1_ch2mr7e,I shall!!! I am so excited to find a support group too. My husband just thinks I am nuts. Lol,Runner5,ch2qbli,2,t5_2tn3u
1211325,0,t1_ci5unrw,True but Id kinda miss building up Able too. Im just about at the point where I can start upgrading buildings.  Guess I can split time between missions and races.,Runner5,ci5w4wa,3,t5_2tn3u

1722252,0,t3_2dqj7k,I dont actually even know what Im supposed to do with my stuff.Do the expansions buildings andor population grow automatically or do I need to do something with these items Im picking up?,Runner5,cjw95kf,1,t5_2tn3u
1879771,0,t3_2g40sz,If you want to turn them off after a few chases youll have to pausestop the mission then restart it where you lift off with chases turned off.I hear theres a way to skip songs on iOS but I dont remember how as I dont have an Apple device but Ive never heard about that feature on Android if you or anyone figures out how to do it please let me know! ,Runner5,ckfpepx,4,t5_2tn3u
2094291,0,t1_ckxvwq2,I have indeed skipped over a song during a run.  Using the iPhone before you unlock the phone you are presented with audio controls of pause skip forward and skip back.  Hit skip forward the song changes and the game continues.  Ive only done it a couple times but it did work for me.  ,Runner5,cl61448,1,t5_2tn3u
2493578,0,t1_cmj9vn3,Another option could be having one person run with chases enabled. While the other person is going to miss out on the audio cues for the chase it might still be fun to shout Zombies run! to let the other person know to start running with you.,Runner5,cmk1rga,5,t5_2tn3u
2502190,0,t1_cmk1ngf,I agree! Ive been investing in some goodquality running stuff for this year. Totally worth it. I need some windproof stuff for anything under degrees but otherwise Im good for now!,Runner5,cml6a6t,3,t5_2tn3u
2531300,0,t1_cmoteqm,There is no shame in having Pacific Rim on there. or if there is I should also be shamed,Runner5,cmoz6xc,2,t5_2tn3u
3023273,0,t3_2uskdj,I thought it was a good break from all the heavy drama of the previous few episodes. Lighthearted and it made me laugh while running which I enjoyed.  And yes youll be back to the action in SM.,Runner5,cobcy26,3,t5_2tn3u
3244809,0,t3_2x8m4r,I was really hoping this was going to be a date announcement. I was too optimistic. Still I loved reading through the sneak peak of the features yall are working on. Very exciting!,Runner5,coybz61,3,t5_2tn3u

3541046,0,t1_cpvrwe1,Actually after using that link I can see that it did. I had no doctor getting excited about the files Id found in the hospital and other story around that point. ,Runner5,cpvwh2i,1,t5_2tn3u
3723975,0,t1_cqgr6wn,so you can listen to it while running and it is an alternative to a mission?,Runner5,cqgrbxt,1,t5_2tn3u
3897291,0,t3_34bezi,I just had this one too and I got emotional on my treadmill. I wasnt able to make a run outside due to weather but I did go to the gym instead. Im getting all misty eyed when he just yells at you in relief. It was a very emotional episode which Im hoping no one noticed me getting teary at the gym.,Runner5,cr0ix10,1,t5_2tn3u

4155073,0,t1_crtvbwq,Also using it for weight loss and I gotta say  its been great motivation to push myself further than I normally would have. WalkRunning . miles almost every day has been great.

4513059,0,t1_cszdxg2,This is correct. Get on wifi and download a bunch of episodes in a row.  Download your season of radio mode while youre at it. ,Runner5,cszinsg,2,t5_2tn3u

4791668,0,t1_cty9sdj,If you want but at some points in the main plot it will be weird where Runner  is left in a cliff hanger and the next side mission we are Im a row boat. ,Runner5,ctyj1p1,2,t5_2tn3u

7423812,0,t3_4gz755,Apple Watch and Strava which is excellent for segments cycling and running. The problem with the Apple Watch and youve no doubt read is that people dont trust it so its hard to use or trust as a baseline. The thing that got my running under control more was Spotifys running playlists...!,Runner5,d2m1ewa,3,t5_2tn3u

9487694,0,t3_5anlri,I finished season one before starting the races.  Thats fine but they do take place in the middle of S.  On Rofflenet people have suggested this order if you want to keep the story chronologicalS Mission  Abel K New Canton K S Missions  Abel K New Canton K Abel K New Canton KOne thing about that though running the New Canton missions will change your perspective on events late in S.  It might be better to hold off and do those after.,Runner5,d9ik7qy,1,t5_2tn3u
10686946,0,t3_5stzbm,Dont think it has any other use than a minigame on the side. It was fun for the first few months but I havent touched mine in over a year. ,Runner5,ddia1ja,6,t5_2tn3u
