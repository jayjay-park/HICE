7757516,0,t1_d3nyhml,I wake up hearing you yelling my name not realizing I had shrunk. A large tree trunk had been jabbing at my side but I didnt think anything of it since I was still groggy. I begin to open my eyes and sit up but I quickly realize Im naked. I grab a blanket which happens to be my top and try to cover myself up. All I see is a strangely painted room that makes it look extremely large. I begin to look around desperately for you not thinking anything had happened. Annie? Annie where are you? Where am I? How did I get naked? Why am I on this denim bAs I talk I look up and see a towering behemoth many stories tall. Her face partially obscured by her breasts I start to notice more and more about her. Her dark hair her eyes her makeup her clothes her denim shorts. This giantess looked extremely familiar. Slowly I realize that the giant I saw was youAnnie!? How!? When!? How did you get so big!?,HearthsHome,d3nyy6z,2,t5_39lm4
