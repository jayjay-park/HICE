3637448,0,t1_cq6uuyh,I would like to see Sonic Adventure  alsomy second favorite game. But that is for my unhealthy hope Jon and Arin would play it if Jon was ever on as a guest.It would be funny to hear Jon and Arin sing City Escape again. Also there would be good game discussion on Sonic Adventure . ,NeoGrumps,cq6wa2r,1,t5_37m50
