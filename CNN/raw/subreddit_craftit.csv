151736,0,t3_1vtkk1,Ehhhhh looks like soldering and other jewelry metal working like bezel settings. The pendant in first pic looks like the little balls would be soldered on but the way the balls are grouped together in the second pic it honestly looks like carving the whole thing out of wax and casting it would be simpler. Im not sure what you exactly want to know...  ,craftit,cevppvf,4,t5_2s3yk

2914104,0,t3_2tg92z,Im not sure if youd have time for this  but maybe you could look into having a table at a local storefarmers marketcraft showsome kind of town event. Theres so much competition online for handmade items but often people will be more inclined to purchase if they know youre local and if theyre already at an event where they intend to spend money. Just a thought and best of luck to you. ,craftit,cnzcaor,2,t5_2s3yk
