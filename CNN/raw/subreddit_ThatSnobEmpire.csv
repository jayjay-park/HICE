And in the latter season Reinhardt himself says hell forgive him if he comes back.... So really it just his myopic devotion that leads him.gtHe isnt motivated with high ambitions like Reinhard do....like Reinhardt is. An that makes him all the more blind and unsympathetic. At least Reinhardt has an impetus. Yang is just blindly obsequious to a cause he doesnt believe in.gtAlso do you remember the time when he is winning on a war but the government officials wants him to go back? He is just following orders as a soldier do....as a soldier does. Yes but that makes him a plot device and an uninteresting twodimensional character. Also he obviously does want to defend the Alliance. After all his order states that he can choose to intervene Reinhardts forces not that it is mandatory. Yet he still does so...gtAlso theres this episode when Reinhard and him talks to each other....Reinhardt and he talk...I do remember that.

I recommend that you watch it again.gtand many people train hard or play a lot with a passion at Ping Pong yet only a few ones manage to be superior just like in LotGH and its not to be expected to be excused.And yet there is a REASON why those people are as good as they are. The main three are the one who trains night and day the one whose strategy is to throw a ball all over the board and see his opponents weaknesses and the one who is motivated by his friend and by his own neardeath experience as well as by the training he got from the old pedophilic woman that was redundant since all women are pedophiles.gtI dont think so. You see how their Ping Pong club perform? They all play at the same time on various tables and dont receive individual coaching. At least the characters didnt prior to the show so theyve already become good without it.Are you serious? The only one who was remotely good was Smile and even he lost to the Chinese guy. Only after training did they get good...Go watch the show again.gtDont use double standards since all shows do this. Even detective stories do it.I was replicating your sophistry.gt...you mean Gurren Lagann?Gurren Laggan doesnt parody mecha tropes. Its just absurd and not a parody.gtJoJo defined shounen and its the likes of One Piece and Hunter x Hunter who got inspired by it not the other way around. and it isnt like Dragon Ball which was a Journey to the West parody early on after transforming into the formulaic nekketsu later on.You can switch the word shounen for the word superhero and itll mean the same thing contextually.gtSo I guess something like YuGiOh which was heavily influenced by JoJo must be parodic with all the characters with crazy haircuts playing with cards or something...Except it didnt make light of tropes.gtLike Kaminas arrogance Thats a personality trait. And doesnt he die?gtnonsense motivational philosophyWhich is funny and not a parody.gttons of drills everywhere or I dont know mechas growing exponentially to epic levels.Overthetop.gtBizarreness doesnt imply parody. It actually excuses JoJo a great deal for its characters reactions since the events are very unusual.Not innately. It also has to make fun of tropes.gtWith your logic TTGL is a parody of mecha or Michael Bay...TTGL is not but Micheal Bays films definitely are.

8807496,0,t3_50sa3q,Snob said that he had no sympathy for the characters because they were making and selling drugs. I find this a stupid reason and I would argue the exact opposite for the first two seasons. Walt needed the money for treatment so he wouldnt die and so breaking the law to try and not die is a very understandable thing to do. Obviously its harder to sympathise with Jesse because he decided he just wanted to make drugs to get money so he wasnt so poor but he absolutely could have avoided his situation.Thats how we were meant to feel about them for the first two seasons. At the end of season  Walt makes the change where he becomes Heisenberg for real. This changes the dynamic entirely. It becomes harder and harder to sympathise with him until it gets to the point where you straight up hate him. Jesse started out being a loser but he couldnt get out of the mess he made for himself due to external forces and when the only way out was death he became trapped and thus the focus of our sympathy.,ThatSnobEmpire,d76jhvn,1,t5_3elcm
