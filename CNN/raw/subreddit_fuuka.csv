4674604,0,t3_3ez30k,I guess you could say... the rabbitz out the bag... ah... get it... sorryAlright chapter. I have to be honest I felt the Koyuki reveal felt meh to me but Im just not the biggest fan of her character dont hate me.I feel like this chapter was missing my girl Fuuka Aoi I was hoping to catch her in the back ground cleaning some toilets or something...,fuuka,ctjs8xs,3,t5_316tc

6872539,0,t1_d0vakbv,Oh no... I think you might be right. Things might be going too well. Inb another truck and another Fuuka? ,fuuka,d0vbbs9,1,t5_316tc
7708797,0,t1_d3ifmil,Lol agreed! I was about to chuck my phone when I saw the truck thing. He totally has a thing or maybe that was just fodder for his audience at this point. Like a haha! Thanks for sticking with it!,fuuka,d3ifswo,1,t5_316tc
7710273,0,t1_d3ilnqh,But what if it was also Aois dad at the wheel of the truck that almost hit her? Then its Truckkun isnt it?????,fuuka,d3iludp,1,t5_316tc
8381681,0,t1_d5ouhii,Oh yeah when all these Manga sites callously steal a chapter that can be read for free. Mangafox literally states by Crunchyroll on each chapter making it blatantly obvious theyre ripping them off.I got my Crunchy account a year back as soon as I got a bank account never looked back.,fuuka,d5p9bcl,2,t5_316tc
8487465,0,t1_d61sd0h,Im down with Koyuki too! Too bad though. I liked the content this time just wondering if the love arc pacing isnt a bit fast though?,fuuka,d62ha5t,1,t5_316tc

10195319,0,t3_5lzewn,First of all Im kinda worried about this. By no means this is gonna bean atrocity like KNIM but the last PV shows passable animation and way too obvious panty shots. But the most worrisome is the story the pace of the manga doesnt fit well a  episodes adaptation.For the longest time Ive been going with the ending at Budokan but when I try to divide up the chapters by episodes I fall short when including everything. So Ill be reducing  Le Bard dispute and v battle of the bands Yuu going blank and not knowing what to sing for the second twitter photo with the introduction of manager girl. Also note that Im reducing the time to for getting the band back together the backstories of what they were doing before fair wind and them droping out of their new engagments. Id also drop Shelley although her appearance is already negligable as it is. I had a reduced role for Koyuki to bring Truckkun on the th but given the PV it seems unlikely her arc is easy relatable and gives music. So Ill also place Truckkun on episode .For the complete songs Id go with One Koyuki song Hedhehogs The town where it rains stars Fair Wind For You and Im guessing an other fifth by either of these bands.,fuuka,dbzp1qd,2,t5_316tc
10244719,0,t1_dc5acft,I literally just read what kinda of anime Im into. Reading Naruto and Bleach was back when I was just getting back into it. Now I watch a lot of RomComs so I read those. Only issue is I now find a lot of them generic. Ill watch and read them all because I love it but some wear out easy. I definitely am glad I picked up this one though. Though Im gonna need a lot of jovial shows this season cause between this and gatsu Im gonna be really stupidly sad a lot.,fuuka,dc5anse,1,t5_316tc
10247216,0,t1_dc5kh0r,that chapter was shocking. What came after that was a series of liver blows and tears.,fuuka,dc5kuh1,1,t5_316tc
10513387,0,t3_5qh60d,basically gist of it if im reading it properly  aoi was feeling guilty about the whole song thing shiranui wanted to recruit her.the band freaking out over no vocalistyuu goes lookingsakura admits she wanted aoi gone something along the lines of i felt at the time that if aoi quit blue wells joined shiranui it would be better...then she felt guilty about the ordealshe tells yuu how she told aoi the song was written for herself not aoi and now this whole thing makes her feel regretshe knows aoiyuu love each other very muchsakura says theres no way for her to intrude?...i think thats how i can translate itshe felt that if there was a way to rid aoi from here that wouldve been goodyuu asks why are you telling me this nowmaking me aware of thissakura says cuz this girl aint akitsuki fuukayuu becomes puzzled and sakura tells him to go as aoi is waitingthen the part i mentionedthe more i read it the more fd up it is haha . sorry about formatting. i have no idea since reddit noob,fuuka,dczsz2x,2,t5_316tc
10727993,0,t3_5t7f8a,I hope Aoi gets ran over by a speeding Yamato. All she does is create drama because of her selfishness. Shes the reason for the fall of Fuukaoriginal the reason Fallen Moon is gone and now shes trying to impact two different bands at once.,fuuka,ddmigfk,-1,t5_316tc
10729826,0,t3_5thklx,Welcome to the family btw! Tuesday nights for Crunchyroll Premium and latter during the week with no consistency for other sites,fuuka,ddmp9fg,1,t5_316tc
10729875,0,t1_ddmp9fg,Thanks man! Looks like im getting premium back then will get me back to watching more stuff anyway.,fuuka,ddmpfz7,1,t5_316tc
10789556,0,t1_ddst4zk,gt Id honestly be okay with no explanation on the Sakura part of it and just leave it to the fans to come up with their own answers.Well its already only fan theories  although Seo pushed hard to make people think about itAoba?,fuuka,ddsv7as,2,t5_316tc
10795748,0,t3_5tmcc1,There seems to be an halt of somesort... sad,fuuka,ddti68g,1,t5_316tc
10986508,0,t1_ded8fov,What I meant was that it seemed like SEO was building up an internal conflict for Yuu as well as an external conflict for Blue Wells. But then it wound up being a misunderstanding of all things. BTW I dont remember your theory theres a lot of em and I lost track. Sorry.,fuuka,dedaaub,2,t5_316tc
11025718,0,t3_5xc1e8,Scums Wish. Probably not the same as the others but I recommended reading it if you want a romance one. NSFW. ,fuuka,dehqkaj,2,t5_316tc
11115823,0,t1_derycio,Its stronger than me ,fuuka,derywjy,1,t5_316tc
11212231,0,t1_df2urj1,spoilerss they dont necessarily need to kill her just make her leave the band or something. Then the rest of the story could follow roughly the same pattern with Aoi joining them. Id be a little sad if Aoi were just a secondary character in a season .Yeah my wish is that they made the anime faithful to the manga but I guess that would require multiple seasons and could be a little tricky.,fuuka,df2w6cu,1,t5_316tc
11334951,0,t1_dfgjcaa,doesnt seem likely,fuuka,dfgsp6w,1,t5_316tc
11635500,0,t3_660q2u,The songs are the best part about the anime and the cover art on the CD is awesome!A little offtopic but Tamas hair color confuses me. It was depicted darker on vol. cover. I guess its just artists freedom right?EDIT Nice flair though,fuuka,dgewajf,2,t5_316tc
