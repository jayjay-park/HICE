3647293,0,t1_cq7ywna,Wow what a messedup set of mixed signals!  No wonder you dont know if youre coming or going probably neither does he!How to let go emotionally?  Start by blocking him physically because for the next little while if he does contact you itll be a trigger.  Then get out amp do things!  Hang with friends go out with guys.  Mostly you let go by filling your hands with other people amp activities.  Good luck!,RBNRelationships,cq80ojn,3,t5_332wo

Im paying  a week instead of  which honestly still isnt bad. I feel like Im getting a lot more out of it than I did with conventional therapy. They have phone sessions available too though Ive never used it. I highly recommend trying it. At betterhelp the first week is free.,RBNRelationships,ctteozt,1,t5_332wo

5361403,0,t1_cvwyxow,If it happens to be something other than a personality disorder which I doubt sure maybe that could help but the fact of the matter is that there are no reliably effective treatments for personality disorders. They tend not to see anything wrong with what theyre doing and therefore dont seek help even when its available. Many therapists wont even take on a client with a personality disorder because they are so very difficult to deal with and they end up as a drain on the therapists emotional resources in the same way that theyre a drain on the emotional resources of the ones close to them. Even if you overcome those obstacles it takes a very skilled therapist to make any headway at all with them and they never really get better except in exceedingly rare cases. Sometimes they end up manipulating the therapist in the same way they do their victims and if this happens absolutely no headway can be made. Even if there is some measure of success in the treatment its VERY slow going and generally requires lifelong maintenance therapy to keep the change up. Ive dealt with people like this both in my personal life and in my professional one Ive worked in psychiatric institutions. They suck the life out of you to the point where youre little more than an empty shell. gtshe may be abusive from time to time but all the others she is the sweetest little thing on this planet.This is how every battered wife speaks about their abusive husband. Get yourself some therapy whether you stay or leave. This is textbook abuse victim mentality and it leaves lasting scars.,RBNRelationships,cvwzaah,3,t5_332wo

8996327,0,t3_51tv3b,I know this is a little late but I am in a similar position  my own issues get in my way of trying to be a better SO to my SO. Ive got no magic but it sounds like youve tackled the biggest hurdle which is identifying  there is actually a problem to work on and  owning your part in it. So lets celebrate that its really hard to do!And then... What next?  Ive tried lots of things two that seem to do us some good maybe theyll help you. The first is when I realize what Im doing I take a few minutes to collect my courage and I tell my SO flat out what is going on. I confess that I know its not helpful to be so disproportionately frustrated or angry and it likely has nothing to do with the situation at hand and I am having trouble reconciling what I feel with whats going on and Im not sure what to do about it. Call it out not judging it but also admitting its no Im causing pain. Admit I dont know what to do to fix it. Let my SO know they dont have to fix it either I prefer not but address the barbed wire elephant in the room.  This has taken  years of work and Im stilling not great at it but it is turning in to my SO instead of pushing away. Second thing which is easier and I feel like a complete cop out but I do it when I cant do the above or its gone on all day I ask for a do over. Literally this is awful can we just start over?  Especially helpful when my SO is also poorly managing things on their end. Im always astonished that it actually works. I have no idea why it works. But its like a magic reset button we can push and hug regroup and move forward. All that aside job lossx and crosscountry moves x  holy hell thats an amazing amount of stress. Enough to overwhelm the most robust of us. Hang in there. It can and will get better. Remember youre getting through it together together being the operative word in the sentence.,RBNRelationships,d7t7wb7,2,t5_332wo
