4571202,0,t3_3dn4xm,Ah! I remember making lots of use of Excite in the mid to late s. Do you remember ExcitExtreme? It was an experimental enhanced version of Excite that made even the beefiest Pentium processors complain which presented search results as a spinning cluster of related solar systems. Heres a news articleI remember the first time I saw it I immediately thought wow its like The Lawnmower Man or something. The future of the web... is VR! Then... a few minutes later I realised that making you look around for the information you were searching for was actually a step backwards not forwards and I switched back to regular Excite.Also oh my god! Somehow Excite still looks exactly the same!,forgottenwebsites,ct6t78q,6,t5_2yzub
