The main concept is to transmute the built up energy into another type and that involves deep concentration. I recommend meditation and yoga though any exercise will suffice. The way you are going about it now sounds terrible! I urge you to not keep torturing yourself! Begin transforming your obsession into creative energy now before you confuse yourself any more. You are simultaneously trying too hard and not really putting in enough honest effort at the same time. Lightly child lightly!,Celibacy,cpwo73v,4,t5_2ro6b

Note that your sexual energy will always be a challenge whether you control it or not.For the time being just try the following If you feel that youre having too much sexual energy i.e. you are horny just do something be productive do sports etc. and just imagine using your sexual energy for it. You will feel that you are more motivated and energetic that way. Thats basically how it works its nothing magic in fact.  If you make this a habit it will become more easy and natural.,Celibacy,dgu6kre,3,t5_2ro6b
