133228,0,t1_cetkthy,Well first and foremost Id reccomend you get some guidelines both vertical and horizontal to keep your letters the same hight and all vertical. Check the wiki it has some great advice. Then find a good book to learn from. Again check the wiki it has good suggestions. Then focus on your technique make sure your nib is held at a constant angle on the page  I think for the script youre writing in keep your downstrokes straight and your spacing even.And be sure to keep practicing and definitely keep submitting your work for feedback. Everyone here is helpful and more than willing to offer advice. Keep at it and youll get better in no time.Any other questions?,Calligraphy,cetlrkz,1,t5_2rkjt

542810,0,t3_20bk22,I started with a calligraphy fountainpen set from Sheaffer and just fooled around really. I was paying attention to the little booklet and on how to draw the letters. I quickly wanted to get my hand on a pointed pen after. So I bought one and it was terrible absolutely couldnt work with it. I thought I had bought the wrong pen and the wrong ink so I sticked with the broad pen for a longer time. Went on the internet for info found this sub and with it Iampeth.Iampeth is like the best resource for books on pointed scripts. A lot are set up to be selftaught so a lot of exercises and information on how to hold your pen etc. etc. I devoured that basically. Joe Vitolo his videos were helpful as well of course. I applied what I learned to my first love see flair and working on my hand ever since. Funny thing. I was absolutely sure I had bought a terrible pointed pen the first time together with terrible ink. So later I decided to see if I was right. But I was wrong. The pen is actually pretty decent and the ink performs not that bad either P I just didnt clean it properly and had no clue... ,Calligraphy,cg1z2ik,1,t5_2rkjt

1545524,0,t1_cj9y1uv,Its equally nice to see you posting again after another hiatus!Thanks for the kind words Im glad you were able to  see it and enjoy the piece. The film is a favourite of many it seemsyoure not the first person to suggest theyd like one too.Thanks for the kind words. I do like drawing the little arched flourishes over the w to make them stand apart but maybe theyre a bit much when they appear so unnaturally frequently as they do here. | The rest of the letters are soso I had to restrain from doing a few common sharedspine letters for legibilitys sake and the whole thing was more rushed than I would have liked as I left it far too late. I literally finished the painting made sure it was dry with a hair drier then rushed to package it and flew out the door to the wedding. |There are two different gold sizes used one for the flat gilding Miniatum Ink and one for the raised gilding Instacol. I like both but Ive had a bit of a problem with Instacol wrinkling on me lately. Not really sure what Im doing wrong there its not a drying time issue maybe Im burnishing too hard too early or something. Ill have to do some further experimenting at some point to sort it out. The problem didnt really materialize in this piece though because I didnt raise the gilding very much as there was no time. However the one or two coats I use did help out the versal letters a bit in helping them pop out a bit from the page.I think either Miniatum or Instacol can be made to work well its largely a matter of preference I guess. I think both are pretty similar formulations.Theres also Tressers Liquid Jesso which uses TiO instead of Lead carbonate so its nontoxic but its obviously a bit more involved to use apparently you need to give it a few days to dry once applied before adding the gold then a couple days after that before burnishing. But unlike the acrylicbased size you can work it a bit once applied to roundsmooth it out and create a nicer finish. I havent used it yet but I do own a bottle I have to spend some cuddle time with it and decide if its for me. It definitely wouldnt have worked on this project because of the time constraints and it is much more expensive than  Instacol to be sure. On the plus side it will apparently last for years if refrigerated whereas Ive been told Instacol is generally only good for a year or so then you have to toss it and buy more.,Calligraphy,cja06y4,1,t5_2rkjt
1546746,0,t3_2byj5y,Hi there!Looks pretty good. Im not sure if youre looking for feedback or not you may wish to update your post with appropriate flair to help us out.I did however observe and you probably did too there are a few errors ... bulldozing the grocer and ... on the third line is missing the c and sileint has an extra i. If I may make a suggestion ...While I realize how impractical it is to do practice on highquality paper a good exercise for us all is to conduct regular practice on paper similar to that we intend to use for finished pieces. Mistakes like these are not uncommon and its a good exercise to practice making corrections for the same reason you practice writing the text itself You will make errors on finished pieces and you want to be able to correct them with the same confidence that you can write the letter forms themselves.Mistakes aside it is also a healthy habit to produce work similar to that we wish to create as finished pieces Edward Johnston was a big proponent of not practicing in the sense that just writing for the sake of practice only trains you in a small number of disciplines compared to actually creating a final piece.

1722419,0,t3_2e5g0k,Hiii!So Im on my phone and about to sleep so this wont be too extensive but your letter width is pretty good! Theyre a bit far apart though. Try decreasing your interletter spacing. The tails on italic letters can connect although that is more of a natural result of good spacing not a forced thing Second thing about Italic is that it has a branching structure in which the downstroke reverses to form the arch. Thus m and n are formed out of a single stroke with no pen lifts. I would link you an image but Im on my phone. If you look very recently in my comment history though I directed someone else to some images demonstrating the branching.Also make sure your downstrokes reach the baseline Hope this helps keep it up and good luck!

1809011,0,t1_ck74niy,It varies depending on the project and what Im trying to achieve. Hot press watercolor paper of a moderate weight and good brand is probably the most commonly used paper for finished works but there are plenty of others. Many of the quality papers to be found at your local art supply store can be usedthe important bits are of course that they are ... Acidfree archival if you want them to last without yellowing Internally sized to handle wet media watercolour paper again being an obvious choice here but many other goodquality papers are designed to handle wet media without being explicitly for watercolour use  Textured suitably to work with your intended use very smallfine lettering is going to be difficult on heavily textured paper and but big letters may benefit from it and writing on a beautifully textured surface can be a very pleasant experience. Coldlightly pressed paper may cause problems with fibres coming loose under your pen which can ruin smaller letters. Paper that is too smooth or shiny may not have enough tooth to allow you to be able to control the pen.Keeping those in mind everything is more or less fair game and it is a great idea to buy single sheets of a variety of papers to experiment and see what works and especially what works for you. Appropriate papers for lettering projects come in different weightsthickness texturesfinishes colours and and price ranges.I was lucky enough to attend a class through my local guild last year which was a hour introduction to the various tools of calligraphy and one whole hour class was dedicated to paper. Our instructor handed out swatches of a good fifteen or so different types of paper of wide varieties for us to try and experiment with in class including several bad papers for lettering on directly so we would be able to tell the difference.This approach is a very good idea and I recommend it without reservation When you buy a paper for the first time take a strip of at least a few square inches and set it aside from the rest and use it to test a few different inkspens on it to see how it behaves. When its dry label it then add it to a binder or folder along with its brandproduct name and other particulars. When you plan your next project youll have a book with all kinds of paper options available to you and can decide what you think is most appropriate for the piece in the comfort of your studio. Its also great to be able to show a client what options are available when performing a commission without requiring an expensive trip to the art supply store to retrieve samples.,Calligraphy,ck75qz7,2,t5_2rkjt

As a noncalligrapher who is in awe of medieval script Im super jealous!!!This looks like an example of early Gothic script otherwise known as transitional Gothic protoGothic etc. very common in French manuscripts of the twelfth century especially those produced in Cistercian scriptoria. Incidentally the classical form of haec is still preserved here only with an e caudata to represent the ae diphthong the e has a little tail like . This eventually fell out of use. The reason it looks like a Humanist script I think is that the Humanists were imitating Caroline miniscule and transitional Gothic as its name implies was halfway between late Caroline minuscule and fullblown textualis. But the Humanists generally dispensed with the sorts of abbreviations we find in this manuscript. ,Calligraphy,cly4tec,6,t5_2rkjt

2429913,0,t3_2nb76u,India ink isnt a good idea for calligraphy. It contains a nonwater soluble material called shellac which is used to confer a measure of waterresistance to the dried ink but means that when the material dries inside your pen the addition of more water wont get it flowing again. In addition to which shellac is thinned with alcohol which evaporates more quickly than water meaning the ink dries more quickly on your pen.Since calligraphy takes time this is a doublewhammy that spells bad news for calligraphy pens. It can damage or even destroy pens when used.The solution is not to buy prepared inks. If you want the blackest black letters money can buy buy some artists grade ivory black designers gouache and thin it with a bit of water.Unlike india ink it always remains  water soluble meaning you can let it dry completely in a pan then just add a couple drops of distilled water to reconstitute and use it for writing. It also generally stays perfectly matte on the page unlike india inkthe shellac makes the letters shiny.The only down sides to gouache are that it can be a little on the expensive side although black is a relatively affordable colour and it will last you a long time and that it is generally too black and needs to be mixed with another colour or thinned a little further to look right.,Calligraphy,cmc1loa,3,t5_2rkjt

2460631,0,t1_cmdycny,Sorry I took so much time in responding. Holidays and such. Yknow. So as you noted yourself you do have rather heavily weighted strokes. Though that does help you to see your hairlineshade transitions. And speaking of hairlineshade transitions... this is probably where you should focus the majority of your attention. You seem to do quite nicely in rounded letters such as your e in which the right half of the letter is perfectly straight along the main slant but the left curves around. However if you look at the straight downstrokes such as the second part of h especially apparent in the nd stroke of m. This example is from my Engrossers guide Should illustrate what I mean in regards to the individual nib tines. There is an exaggerated gap between the downstroke and the hairline exit stroke. But this is the same principal when you invert it. I dont like the example I penned in the guide so disregard that one. I was trying to find examples to link you to from the IAMPETH site. But its currently under maintenance so I wont be able to link to all  of them. If you look at this piece here it very effectively demonstrates the individual nib tine movement thing. As a note its particularly evident in your l on the top line. The right nib tine actually comes back in to the left. Try to avoid that and maintain the stroke perfectly straight the entire way. The same thing can be seen in your t.Something else to pay attention to is the slant. If you look at the word Zanerian look at the strokes of the a and n. When comparing them to the slant lines visible through the page you can see its a little off. In the line below that in your i strokes really try to maintain the straightness of both sides of the stroke until right before the baseline. Its particularly evident in the first i in which it kinda tapers throughout the entire stroke.Lastly try to make sure the lower hairlineshade transitions are oval shaped. If you look at the as in the bottom row the exit strokes seem a little angular. You do a much better job of that earlier in the piece so it could just be fatigue. But its something to take note of. Id really suggest just working on fundamentals for a bit. Dont even do full letters like i. In regards to this image again dont even pen the exit stroke. Just pen the weighted downstrokes and try to get the individual nib tine movement down.Youve come really far though and Id love to see some more of your work! Keep practicing and keep posting. Shoot me a message if you have more questions. When IAMPETH comes back up Ill try to link you to some examples.,Calligraphy,cmfu3aq,1,t5_2rkjt

2688607,0,t1_cn9htup,Your points are fair though Im not sure Id consider either to be particularly compelling arguments.The requirement for straight strokes is accurateso much so that the consistency required is in itself a challenge especially for a beginner you see problems with wobbles and teetering letters frequently. Foundational is more forgiving in this respect.I disagree that spacing is easier in Gothic compared to Foundational the rules are different but not simpler. Ive definitely seen people mess up and even actively resist instruction on correct spacing in Gothic compared to other hands because the former is not intuitive nor familiar to modern readers. The average beginner is also completely ignorant of white space they only see the mark they make not the forms they create where the pen doesnt pass you dont need any more proof that this is the case than to look at the average beginners work that goes right to the edge of their paper.Once you get into more advanced Gothic work the white space and relationship of the letters to one another becomes even more important than the letters themselves subtleties like where to place thorns connecting the feet of letters careful placement of entry serifs to make letters distinguishable and legible. Gothic isnt meant to be an illegible mess the good historical texts are actually pretty legible. Its our modern amateur interpretations that dont understand these many nuances the experienced scribes put into their work ... And these nuances are a problem for the beginner. Even professional scribes like Sheila struggle with them unless they have dedicated a considerable amount of time to studying the forms to gain a deeper understanding of them. Unsurprisingly skilled German scribes like Koch Zaph Neugebauer and Hfer have a better understanding of the Gothic hands than most other Europeans especially the English and those of us across the pond because it has been ...  unsavoury to show too much interest in the works of a nation with whom there was considerable political friction for many decades.Is good Foundational immune from these nuances? Of course notpen manipulation and numerous kerning pairs are present there too just look at page  of Foundations of Calligraphy for proof of both but I would assert that Foundational suffers less dramatically when these quibbles are ignored compared to Gothicand that the list is considerably shorter as it does not concern itself with the biting of bows obsession over certain archaic letter forms Rrotunda long  etc. numerous complexities arising due to misunderstandings and ignorance regarding the use of majuscules and their proportions slower writing speed and the numerous other pitfalls which beginners find themselves down in the weeds over.All of this is just my opinion of course and not meant to infringe upon or replace yours.

Check out the buying guide for some ideas if you need help with what tools recommended to use. You are following your slant guidelines well which most beginners have trouble with. Generally letters with ascending loops b f h k l would go up a step higher into the nd ascender space. Letters with descending loops g j q y z would go a step lower into the nd descender space. If its your first time I suggest taking a step back and practice basic shape drills. Im not sure if the book you are using has a section for it. edit A few other things you could look at when I started learning is Joe Vitolos videos for basic letterforms. You can find them on youtube easily He groups up each video with letters that have similar forms in them. They are all short videos anywhere between    or  minutes.

3413070,0,t1_cph9gx2,I dont know who you include as being webut the Bastard hands are not very widely practiced in modern times especially compared to Fraktur. Fraktur is by far the most commonly practiced Gothic hand in modern times likely because it is so flexible and varied and is more legible than Textura due to its spacing especially to modern eyes. Virtually all the modern Bastard scripts Ive seen posted here have learned them more or less exclusively from David Harris His influence is farreaching but unfortunately all tooeasily recognizable for his works many faults oversights and idiosyncracies. His book The Art of Calligraphys greatest fault is probably that the author dissects each script into individual letterforms without adequately explaining how they are meant to work together and only offers a partial script analysis to his readers. This is why for example we see so many people making the Textura hands with c r and t as he draws them with a hairline to the right but fails to explain that this only happens at the end of a word never in the middle of one or how he fails to explain that Bastard Secretary Italic and Carolingian are some of the fastestwritten hands and thus writing rhythm is crucial to their usewhile Capitalis Quadrata Insular Majuscule formal Uncial and other zeroslope scripts are among the slowest and generally speaking the most difficult to pen and even more challenging to maintain consistency due to the broken rhythm of writing them.Better calligraphy books will offer a ductus but will also illustrate how the text looks in a block. Jackie Svarens book is excellent in this regard for example. Stan Knights Historical Scripts is even better in this regard since it shows choice historical exemplars of each script instead of modern interpretations.Perhaps it is this unfaithful interpretation or the result of incautious examination that would lead one to believe that Fraktur and Bastard Secretary are easily confused. If written properly they shouldnt be.,Calligraphy,cphbc9z,3,t5_2rkjt

3579970,0,t1_cq0b5qf,To study music we must follow the rules. To make music we must break them.It is certainly the calligraphers prerogative to decide when and where to bend or break rules.The allimportant word here is decide. A calligrapher makes an informed decision to do so knowing exactly what the rules are why they exist and what they hope to achieve by breaking them.This deeply informed and educated approach is entirely distinct from the common claim look at the new script I invented. No you didnt. You took bits and pieces from memory often misremembered and threw them down on a page. There is a tremendous difference between that nave approach and the work of the likes of Edward Johnston Irene Wellington Donald Jackson or John Stevens. The latter have all created new scripts in the lifetimesbut none sprang forth from the vacuum they were rather developed from a lifetime of study and deep understanding of the letters and the evolution they have all undertaken throughout their long lives.I believe beyond a shadow of doubt that welleducated calligraphers are the most aware individuals when it comes to the design and use of our letters. It is glaringly obvious to a trained eye when design rules were broken by a clear informed design decision vs. ignorance.,Calligraphy,cq0cf8u,8,t5_2rkjt

4910827,0,t3_3i5azd,I recently went on holidays for two weeks and I took some nibs some pen holders a small bottle of ink and some paper with me. All I was carrying was a single small ruck sack. The calligraphy material didnt take much space at all. On the way back I carried much more because there happened to be a shop with lots of decent calligraphy material.I always carry a broadnibbed italic fountain pen with me. These pens are ideal when youre starting because you dont have to dip all the time. Of course I also carried a small bottle of fountain pen ink with me.If I had to do this again Id also take a roll of paper with me because it is easier to carry than sheets of paper.Now getting back to your starter kit I wouldnt buy them because theyre may more expensive than the sum of the components in them but there are exceptions. What is more you probably wont need everything in the kit so itll be more expensive than just buying the components you need. Just get yourself a few nib holders some nibs of your choice some pencils hbh a soft eraser and a long ruler. A book with some samples of different alphabets may be useful especially if it has instructions on how to draw the individual letters. A small box for the nibs nib holders pencils and erasers may be worth your while.Draw some pages with guidelines on goodquality heavy paper at home and take them with you.

5035821,0,t1_cusyz92,I think this is the best answer.If you know the intent behind the scripthand youll have the best frame of reference for how to practice. For broad pen theres a large difference between how batarde and Textura were written. Understanding that will allow you more accurately reproduce to the hands.gt With limited time available why not spend all the time with pen in hand one can?It is absolutely imperative that you train your eye along with your hand. For example well look at Engrossers Script. As TK mentioned Engrossers is penned slowly almost like engraving on paper. Knowing this will help for you to understand the shadehairline transitions pen lifts writing speed nib tine manipulation etc.. Unlike modern copperplate. If you dont really study that much they can look similar. But with a bit of reading into the background on both theyre worlds apart. ,Calligraphy,cut0als,6,t5_2rkjt

5438944,0,t1_cw6v4ti,I was taught to use a brush for ink dipping. Basically you dip a brush or a different dip pen in the ink and then you apply the ink on the top of your working nib. This way it doesnt get underneath the nib. Also watch how the ink spreads on the nib if its covering the nib firmlyevenly  its probably clean if some places dont get wet or repel the ink  clean it. The easiest and the fastest way is to use a lighter. Or a toothpaste. Or some dishwashing liquid. Basically you want something to vanish oils.

The way I approached it was to use a spatula to scoop a little from the bottle into a palette then gradually work in some water with an old brush till I got the right consistency a thickish paste.

7949612,0,t1_d49kqeb,OK so let me preface this by saying quite a few things. First I feel a bit conscious that I may be giving you not so good advice. The thing is that while I would say my TQ is decent Im hesitant to give advice. So as always please take what I say with a hint of skepticism and see for yourself on the historical exemplars.Also your As and everything are correct its my preference that they have a diamond as a foot but its not incorrect how you are doing it just fyi.The S as I said is quite good and if you like it then great! but there are a few other options for the S just so you know.Finally. Dont despair because of the spacing. Its something incredibly difficult that the only way to get it correct is to practice a ton. Im for example trying to do Foundational and man after a few months and a ton of practice sheets I still can make two N have the same width... its impossible!So heres my actual comment lol First Im sorry for the not so good.. anything Im having dinner and I did it in a bit of a hurry although its not awful haha.Imagine if you will two Is together with the proper spacing and everything now if you join their bottom diamonds with a hairline you have a version of the u right? well the a varying with your hand of course that is to say the style is pretty much the same. So heres my take The first letter is a I and then my take on the A but the one you are doing is slightly different and again as valid as any other version that instead of joining the diamonds what you do is to have an elongated diamond in a slightly different angle to join the two strokes. Its pretty much the same thing though you start the foot at the same place.Also heres my take on the word Saga to show you that the spacing should be consistent the S is an exception though or at least try to be haha.

You could practice for  minutes a day and make progress but of course the more the better. That being said dont compare yourself to someone who has  hours a day to practice when you might only have  minutes.

10941438,0,t3_5wa8by,I think this is rather good. Being a bit of half uncial nerd and assuming this is for cc  Id say this doesnt suffer as much as your regret at the choice of script implies. Couple of small things  the cross strokes on the t and the g should be straight and were usually done in the main insular manuscripts with a very flat pen angle so they tend to be very thin and crisp. The triangular serif on those cross strokes according to Timothy ONeill was added with the corner of the pen and filled in though most modern ductus imply it was done as a pen twist. Somewhere in the book of Kells theres a d or a t with the serif outlined but the scribe seems to have forgotten to fill it in! Your n is too narrow and the downstroke of the R usually doesnt descend below the baseline. And in the interests of being maddeningly and infuriatingly pedantic it might have been better to use the secondary form of d  Ive done a crude scan here  As you can see its very similar to a modern minuscule d.Youve got the basics of half uncial down  keep at it its a beautiful script when done well with respect for the original forms which you clearly have in shovelfuls!,Calligraphy,de8j64a,7,t5_2rkjt

11262944,0,t1_df8j0q1,Not sure how specific of a response youre looking for it kind of looks like a Brause EF but a little too grainy to know for sure. Any flexible pointed pen nib would work though. You may be confused about the nib vs holder they are separate. The nib is what will give the thin upstrokes and thick downstrokes. Then there are straight and oblique holders that you put the nibs in. Oblique holders are used to help with getting the steep  degree slant used in traditional roundhand writing. The wiki and best of have additional info if you are interested!,Calligraphy,df8mzgv,5,t5_2rkjt
11263398,0,t1_df8n5s0,You wont be able to write that large with a standard nib. The shades will either need to be built up or you will need to letter the whole thing. You can certainly do the writing at a smaller size scan it in and blow it up then retrace and reink.,Calligraphy,df8ou9b,6,t5_2rkjt

11651870,0,t1_dgdf6r5,Yup doing all the right things here! I like that crossbar on the t which is very stylish. A few things  nice though the praise from the poster below is I think your serifs could be sharper and personally I prefer the absolutely flat top serif that comes from a flat angle. Theyre the right size though and most of your letterforms are showing proper construction. Dont be afraid to use a corner of the nib to give yourself a sharp straight entry stroke before the diagonal on the serif.  Likewise the top of the f starts in a very thin stroke and twists out. Youre getting that bottom ligature pretty consistently which is good and not always easy.Overall my main criticism would be that youre not really having as much fun with hairlines as you might though I suspect thats the pen and ink combo. This looks like it was done with a rather watery ink and a PPP but whatever it is is inhibiting the thickthin contract that will really lift the script.,Calligraphy,dggr59s,2,t5_2rkjt
