9027378,0,t3_53rpxk,I personally like to believe that Cassiels sacrifice was not in vain but was a necessary step in sealing a magical contract strong enough to bind even Auric Ascended. Cassiel was the archangel of Force after all and Dagdas sphere specializes in both making and enforcing agreements. Force magic can make political boundaries stronger than physical walls. Auric may not have explicitly agreed with Cassiels terms but by not rejecting them and then accepting what Cassiel offered his life and the blood that made Auric an immortal he became bound nonetheless. The Grigori lands would thus be the safe from the Illians and the White Hand forever or at least as long as Auric lives with Cassiels blood in his veins. Even as the new God of Winter plunged the world into another Ice Age he might have been forced to leave the climate of Grigori lands unchanged. Other enemies could of course still threaten them but long history of governing as little as possible should leave the Grigori people more prepared than most to continue without a strong leader. I think the Grigori would continue to thrive although some cities might break off under certain ambitious politicians like Minister Koun or might rebel in order to preserve their old traditions in the central government was taken over by such ambitious men.  I believe the Grigori identity is strong enough that they would not easily submit to any foreign empire particularly one with a state religion. Their culture may be a melting pot but the result is too potent to be assimilated into another culture even if temporarily conquered. Some enemies may see Cassiels demise as a sign of weakness and use the opportunity to invade but I think they would fail. However the need to fund a war effort might wear away at some of the great Grigori traditions. Im afraid the Grigori would not be able to rely entirely on voluntary donations but would have to start levying taxes. They would probably rely on War Bonds more than taxes during the war which would necessitate even higher taxes after the war in order to pay back their debtors with interest. I suspect that figures analogous to Alexander Hamilton would emerge who would use the need to preserve the full faith and credit of the national debt as an excuse to push for a stronger government better suited to the desires of the elites. They would not get everything they want as the theme of their patron sphere is Compromise. Theyd establish a new Constitution which would basically be a big government coup but would preserve enough individual liberty that it would be the envy of the rest of the world and would be revered almost religiously by the more libertarian elements generations later once the government has expanded past its legal bounds. I expect the practice of selecting uncompensated magistrates through sortition would mostly replaced with the democratic election of politicians who receive taxpayer funded salaries.  I see them as remaining relatively Laissezfaire long enough to develop the strongest economy in the world but then attracting the attention of the Stewards of Inequity. The worship of Mammon would be far more welcome among the Grigori then the worship of any other god as even most of the most devout followers of Mammon do not believe they worship anyone but themselves. Once a few Grigori are rich enough they would conspire to crush compensation and keep themselves rich at the expense of others. Eventually the Grigori would become a corrupt and litigious society with far more regulations than are good for them.  Remember that Lawyers are represented by the Force sphere not by Law.It is possible that the Luonnotar would gain popularity in some regions. I do not believe the worship of The One would ever become a de jure state religion but it could become associated with Grigori Patriotism and fill a role similar to Evangelical Christianity in the Bible Belt of the USA. Before this happens it would of course splinter into many different denominations with major disagreements with each other. Some would welcome the position of a civil religion some would find it blasphemous some would try to exterminate other religions by government force and some would see any alliance with the state as evil.,fallfromheaven,d7wy6b7,6,t5_35pkj
