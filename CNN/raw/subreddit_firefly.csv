61717,0,t1_celg9c9,Jayne was not stupid.  He knew full well that harboring River and Simon was dangerous to all of them.  Further Jayne had a crush on Kaylee  which meant he hated Simon from the moment Kaylee liked him.  That he would turn on Simon and River who he had no loyalty to was perfectly understandable though certainly not laudable.  But none the less Jayne was sincerely sorry for having been disloyal to Mal even though at the time he had thought it would be best for all of them if Simon and River were gone  he really had not considered just how much of a betrayal to Mal his calling the Feds was.As I said  Jaynes intentions to those he was loyal to could be trusted  that does not mean he was not sometimes stupidly impulsive.  I might add after the fact he was sincerely sorry for turning on Simon and River even though he still hated Simon because of Kaylees attachment to him.,firefly,celgg0p,1,t5_2qs24

411402,0,t1_cfne9iw,I can respect that.  I never really got into comics for this exact reason.  Im a bit of a completionist and I would rather just not become invested at all than to risk missing an issue and left unfullfilled.  I started reading Walking Dead with the volumed collections before the show came out.  After falling behind a few times between the release of the newer collections I found a local shop that would save new issues for me and call me when they were out.  Its not quite as satisfying as sitting down and reading a bunch straight through but its more current and if you start following a couple different things at once its not too bad.  Its kinda like watching a show as it comes out vs. waiting for the DVD set.  To each his own.  Ive been on both sides of that fence too.  Personally Ive just grown too impatient to wait the extra time it takes for the full collection to be released for all the mediums. ,firefly,cfnep2m,2,t5_2qs24

I really really like Early such an intersting character and I wouldnt have minded a spinoff series with his earlier adventures. Also River was great in that episode.  Out of Gas is probably my third favourite episode actually but Im not a hundred percent sure I might need anothe rewatch or two or three to decide.

1871001,0,t3_2fzr4b,I would suggest the short film  The R. Tam SessionsThis excellent deleted sceneDeleted scenes Deleted scenes After that you are pretty much left with only text content.The script for season one episode   Dead Or AliveEarlier version of the script for the Serenity movie  has some good scenes in it that did not make it into the movie. Also has a better ending at least in terms of a possible continuance of the series.After that you are down to fan fiction  there is tons of it much of it not very good. You have to search and pick what you like for yourself.Many consider My Own Kind Of Freedom  by Steven Brust to be the best of them. At least it is written by a professional Scifi author.You can also search for a lot of fan made music video montages  some are quite good  but sadly Fox keeps getting them yanked almost as fast as they get made. You Cant Take The Sky From Me is one of the better ones. Also I really enjoyed Simon amp River  Magic There were several others I could have recommended but they have all been pulled.After that Firefly is largely done. You have to look for other things to watch. You might take a look atWonderfalls  though a comedy and not really Scifi but it was Tim Minears next project after Firefly and his brilliant writing and sudden  degree plot twists really shine. Also Jewel Staite Kaylee guest stars in some of the episodes.Journeyman  another brilliant SciFi timetravel show canceled way too early.Terminator The Sarah Connor Chronicles  not in the same league with Firefly but it is SciFi and worth a look. Stars Summer Glau River and she is always worth watching.Farscape  also definitely not in Fireflys league but it is not only SciFi but SpaceOpera as well. Though there are some pretty bad episodes there are also some excellent ones as well.Firefly was SciFi and cowboys mixed  if you have any interest in cops shows by all means take a look atLongmire  which is cops and cowboys mixed  very well done  another series people cant help but binge watch.And finally here are some wallpapers for you.,firefly,ckendej,3,t5_2qs24

1978205,0,t1_ckribmv,Yeah well they need to get a reality check about game design. RSI is doing early access as right as they can.

Again Double Fine and other did the same but they failed to deliver finished products. In fact Double Fines only completed project in the past few years has been Costume Quest  amp  neither of which were crowdfunded. In fact they werent even announced until they were about to launch. RSI has targets. They have a business strategy. They have professionals working on it. Theyre building a AAA game using independent funding. AAA games take a long time to make and theres a reason for it.Dont get me wrong I hate the way the big publishers work. Its not right.

2077801,0,t1_cl3wjvm,Being at work means I do not have all day to explain to you point by point of why you are wrong about Adam Baldwins twitter comments. I follow him as well as some I dont agree with and the trend is this. Someone says something Adam doesnt agree with and he challenges them on it.. They respond with an insult or some insinuation that Adam is a bigotracisthomophobe or whatever.. Adam sometimes responds in kind with evidence of this person doing exactly what they accused Adam of doing.If you want to see a recent example of this go read the back and forth between Adam and Tom Arnold. Another thing if you do not get it when Adam is being sarcastic or is being absurd to point out other absurdities then you probably shouldnt be reading his timeline.Some quick specifics from your last commentgt I called Adam Baldwin an asshole because I think being an apologistgt for misogyny and being confrontational while at it is being an asshole.This hasnt happened and is an example of comments being taken out of context. Read the full twitter conversion not the one comment and assume you have the entirety of the conversation.gt I just felt you were being combative.No you just didnt like being challenged on your assertions. I understand Reddit is pretty much one sided politically leftist so being challenged isnt common. I typically dont say anything but sometimes things need to be said. You are completely wrong on Adam Baldwin.gt I dont like it when he does bizarre shit like challenge Devin Faraci to a fight even if its in jest.Again dont read his timeline. Its not meant for you.gt Thats not a straw man thats me saying I hear a lot of conservatives and centrists liberals whatever. Mostly gt conservatives. who are always whining about things like the thought police because I happen to think its not gt OK to call someone a faggot. Or unlike Baldwin I think Paula Deen or anyone else should be castigated and gt scorned when they use the Nword. Is it unreasonable to think someone should have to apologize for that?This entire paragraph is more of the same fallacy crap. You obviously dont know what a fallacy is. ,firefly,cl3xmji,0,t5_2qs24

The Blue Sun expansion adds more board to the table as well as two new Contractors and more Reaver interaction. The Pirate and BH set adds more player interaction. Dont forget to get The  card promo pack and the Artful Dodger promo pack from Amazon. The Artful Dodger is a th Firefly ship that is a little different from the standard ships.

5823215,0,t3_3uw912,The design of Serenity itself show a remarkable lack of computer control.  Perhaps rareearth elements are far more uncommon in The Verse than in our solar system.The Verse after all is huge by our standards  with more than  earths in it.  Without FTL travel even of a message from one side of the rim to the other probably takes weeks  and actual physical travel months or years  little point in maintaining data regarding things on the other side of the rim.  Combine that with a relatively high cost of maintaining vast amounts of data and I think what we have is simply a society that has different expectations and different methods than ours.As we saw in the twohour pilot episode there are deadspots where computers can be out of touch with rest of the solar system.  Perhaps that has something to do with why they are not relied on or why they are not all sharing the same data.What seems crazy or inexplicable to us might just be the way it is to them.,firefly,cxiy5mr,3,t5_2qs24

7172297,0,t1_d1tewgf,gt I dont know if any of this will help you but oh well.The main problem is the ReaverAlliance ships and negative events. They inexplicably pop up VERY frequently. I end up losing a LOT to that. Then you get into a scenario where you have a full mission hand that cant be done  either because it requires skill rolls you cant complete anymore thanks to Reavers killing them or because your passengers are dead or because your cargo was confiscated. Then poor morale hits the crew and they leave. Getting those cards early and often is BRUTAL and it always seems to happen to us. Luck of the draw sure but definitely NOT just confirmation bias. In my play group there are several other people who refuse to play Firefly now because theyve seen this shitty mechanic in action. So yeah thats my biggest problem  cant keep a crew cant keep passengers routinely lose cargo and contraband due to random events and end up literally unable to complete any missions without finding a way to buy new cargo or contraband which usually requires a random event that someone else always seems to get. End up burning my meager starting money on fuel trying to  find the event. IIRC you need to have already done missions with the missiongivers to buy shit from them so its a massive shitty catch right out the gate when shit like that happens.So I always end up limping from system to system and being forced to stop and do odd jobs for the  per turn or whatever then limp to a place I can buy gas and that is my entire game. By this point other players who arent met with shitty lucky are usually already  objectives in trying for the last one and the game ends soon after.Look I get what the response will be just shitty luck. Fine. But its shitty luck that happens to someone every single game. Literally not one game weve played hasnt seen someone get fucking destroyed by the random event cards early on leaving them unable to recover the rest of the game. Thats a terrible game right there. I hate Firefly for the same reason I hate Catan most games might even be fine but it SUCKS to be in a position where you know you literally cant win but are still in the game and have to act out your turns and watch and wait. My first ever game of Catan was like that too. The guy teaching us blocked me in and I couldnt do anything but draw cards every turn as he left me  options. He thought it was hilarious I thought this game fucking sucks. Being helpless in a board game isnt fun especially one that lasts  hours or MORE sometimes and takes  minutes just to set up.,firefly,d1tf82v,1,t5_2qs24
