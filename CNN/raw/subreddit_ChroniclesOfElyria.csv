7498019,0,t3_4i2gsm,Yeah this is rather interesting. Id like to know how all that will work too since eventually mining and other resource gathering jobs will be obsolete.,ChroniclesOfElyria,d2uhi76,2,t5_35ag3
7513819,0,t3_4i9s57,I just love the way theyre approaching PvP with this game.. pretty much something Ive been wanting to see in an MMORPG since forever.,ChroniclesOfElyria,d2wa82u,4,t5_35ag3
7542572,0,t1_d2zh1yg,Thats how projects work you have a limited budget and you have to make hard choices about what you can really do with it and sometimes those choices arent apparent until you come to that bridge.Imagine buying your first car. At first glance you have the money for the car of your dreams but then the reality sets in that you need to buy a title and a tag pay for gas and insurance maintenance etc. Next thing you know you arent driving the car you envisioned yourself in but you are in the best thing you could afford. Thats just how things are for most people unless you are incredibly privileged.Realistically this games budget is small for an MMO and while vision can really push the genre forward and make an awesome game sometimes you have to sacrifice some of your vision for the sake of making things fly.,ChroniclesOfElyria,d2zjye0,3,t5_35ag3
7615679,0,t3_4jl674,Yes a console port is planned but low priority. The game is designed to easily be ported once complete. Dont expect a console version at launch but down the road it is planned. ,ChroniclesOfElyria,d37v2s3,0,t5_35ag3

7689344,0,t1_d3e60rs,there is another factor  has a talent but not everyone of those  has its talent activated so very few players will likely have active talents.And besides Magic talent is rare even among the talents so perhaps  playerson  will have access to that,ChroniclesOfElyria,d3g89k5,2,t5_35ag3

7782057,1,t3_4lw8xu,When will we hear more about the plans for taming and training animals?Will we be able to expect the ability to modify animal breeds for instance making them larger making them more dangerous i.e. would it be possible to create hunting rats or something equally different from the norm?,ChroniclesOfElyria,d3qr72z,3,t5_35ag3
7784449,0,t3_4lw8xu,IP and Kickstarter will give a lot of access to initial income and in game profit. If a person plays every day for  hours a day but doesnt have the ability to invest real money. Can they still be at a competitive level?,ChroniclesOfElyria,d3r0zag,1,t5_35ag3
7784633,0,t3_4lw8xu,Q How realistic will communication be? I understand that as far as an MMO people will need to be able to talk easily but this project seems to focus a lot on the real capabilities and properties of in game tools. How about NPCs? Will we have to wait for news to arrive by mail or go back to talk to anyone we want to? To what extent has communication involved in the game?,ChroniclesOfElyria,d3r1qdd,1,t5_35ag3
7789996,0,t3_4lw8xu,Id like to hear a little about the AI and NPC behaviour and the seeded town content. For example will they have different ratios of buildings so one town may go hungry and pick up activity when a merchant trades a shipment of food. While the foods scarce will people hang around town and stop woodcutting or mining etc? If buildings fall apart will they move town potentially? Will NPC children have a  chance of taking their parents profession and otherwise the most in demand trade at the town etc?,ChroniclesOfElyria,d3rnhm6,1,t5_35ag3
7793155,0,t1_d3s0161,Nah man to get a truly random number you need to hire a bunch of workers like about k people.Have them sit in a giant warehouse with each of them getting a cube.The cube contains a computer with a number pad a light a d or  and a camera for verification.When a roll command is made a cube will get a red light. The cubeperson will roll his dice and input the value manually. That value is returned to the player.It really is the only way to get TRUE random.,ChroniclesOfElyria,d3s0biv,5,t5_35ag3

9019635,0,t3_53t3k5,Not trying to be rude but we know when the store is going to open. It will open on October rd. It was in the dev journal of September th which can be read here They had some delays but they were and still are very open about the development they are always around on IRC the forums and discord. I still have much faith in them. Developing a game is really hard following a schedule when running a company and trying to develop a game is not easy. So yes there will be delays and that is almost inevitable. But they have always informed us of delays the were always there answering our questions they never stopped doing that. They can handle criticism quite well they have constantly be scrutinized with people constantly thinking this project will fail or end badly and they have held up really well. If you read through the dev journals and looked through the forums more you would see where are constantly active and answering our questions. You just have to open your eyes. Sorry if this came off a bit rude,ChroniclesOfElyria,d7w0ouk,12,t5_35ag3

10219273,0,t1_dc2atlh,They said they want and will get a publisher for marketing only. However youre somewhat right. They intend to develop the whole game by themselves without rd party having a say in that.Just to clarify marketing costs are not a small part of the total cost see below for examples.GTA  development mil  marketing mil The Witcher  development mil  marketing mil Final Fantasy VII development mil  marketing mil Im also not sure to what extent the partnership with Improbable goes BUT! it seems like partnering with Improbable brought down the cost by a huge amount.,ChroniclesOfElyria,dc2euk4,3,t5_35ag3

10438561,0,t1_dcr6e9k,The information on the growth of settlements and the structures required to be considered the next step up are still the same.. Everyone is in charge of the safety of their people but ultimately Dukes are the ones who run the police force within the Kingdom  specifically within each settlement in their Duchy. Barons are the recruiters but the Dukes have the final say in that respect unless they plan to play differently. Im not quite sure what that has to do with the similarities as far as Hamlet gt Village gt Town gt City vs Keep gt Stronghold gt Castle.,ChroniclesOfElyria,dcra9rw,1,t5_35ag3

10663074,0,t1_ddf1ruz,I think youre confusing Influence Points IP for Exposition Points EP.If you go into the store you can see your EP in the top right. That is the total amount of EP you have from the amount youve bought as well as what your pledge gives you. These can be used in the EP store to buy items for exposition.IP can be viewed if you go into your account on the site. This tells you your total Influence. Influence is a scale of how much money youve spent in the store and how many people youve recruited so far kickstarter backers also got a very small amount of influence.Influence is amongst others used to determine when you get to choose your land during land selection as the list of players will be sorted by their amount of influence and then going down from the top of the list in descending order.Influence points cannot be used to buy items in the Exposition store.,ChroniclesOfElyria,ddftcbh,2,t5_35ag3

11458368,0,t3_63ka5g,Ive thrown  into the game which is more than Ive ever spent on a game. I have confidence in the developers moreso than the game. Even if the game isnt perfectly as described I think SbS would have a sufficient reason or compensation. For one Caspian is much more accessible than other developers. Ive literally played league with the guy. Hes chill. Ive also seen how hands off they are in the subreddit in a place that would be extremely easy to censor and manipulate conversation wise they dont. In my mind theyre a solid company with a solid plan. That was enough for my support. ,ChroniclesOfElyria,dfusqr9,10,t5_35ag3
11617187,0,t1_dgcqlzf,gtAgain I just think its super sick that this game isnt like a typical MMO. If world of Warcraft had giant Horde vs Alliance battles everyone would be joining in because everyone is the same but with CoE Im excited to be part of something bigger than my individual gameplay.I think you hit the nail on the head as to what separates CoE from a regular mmorpg. CoE focuses more on the repercussion of events than just the events themselves and allows for a wide array of reactions to those events.,ChroniclesOfElyria,dgcth39,5,t5_35ag3
11664172,0,t1_dgi2yu5,I believe what theyve said before in regards to that is that such features are highly likely to appear in the game regardless of their stretch goals being met on time...But only those that have had their stretch goals filled in the time given are assured of being present in the game on launch. So Id imagine mounted combat despite missing the stretch will be present in the game relatively early on. It just might not be in the game on the day of launch. Which strictly speaking isnt going to impact many folk straight off the bat barring vagabonds and highwaymen as well as guards out to chase said vagabonds and highwaymen down so by the time were all settled in and ready to start with the proper smash and slash it should be in hopefully!,ChroniclesOfElyria,dgi5dax,6,t5_35ag3

11797548,0,t3_68beld,Honestly Im always paranoid that I dont have all of the information when I go to answer questions about COE I usually end up researching the topic more as I type the answer out. That being said we do have a lot of great resources like the wiki that are under utilized and not maintained by the community as well as it could be. Plus I think if everyone could keep up with all of the information about a game it would make for a really generic or boring game. Hell Ive been playing  days to die for  hours and Im still finding new things out. ,ChroniclesOfElyria,dgxajbw,3,t5_35ag3
