Ive played with quite a few very good warriors and their dps is great in the hands of someone that knows what hes doing. But its like that with any class in TERA if you play well your dps is going to be good and if you play badly even if your gear is relatively good you are not going to have as much dps.Most groups dont want a large number of warriors though since the endurance debuff they put on enemies doesnt stack with each others and they can also interfere with each others dps this is to do with the edge mechanic which is only applicable at higher levels.,TeraOnline,cgppgva,1,t5_2s527

1066558,0,t3_26b3zn,The difference between the two is that MT allows open world PvP and MT people tend to focus more on PvP.  As such when you see the successful  messages or inspect people at  more often than not theyll be in Strikeforce or better gear.I feel that the people in MT strive more to be the best at PvP than people in other servers.  They dedicate more of their time to learning gearing and focusing on becoming better so they can win in s FWC or even just duels.  Youll often find groups of people dueling outside cities and of course in Velika Outskirts.On the negative side of that I feel that during my time spent in MT that people were more aggressive and tend to look down on others more.  Now this isnt the case for every player but I did notice a rather large amount of people who behaved as such.  I hope you have thick skin and dont let others get to you.  Youll need it as a healer as well since they often times get the brunt of everyones hate if people start dying.If you want to do end game PvP but cant find a decent PvP guild on TR that will take you in by all means go to MT staying here may just hold you back.  Be aware that theres also good PvPers and PvP guilds on TR as well.  A few PvP guilds I can think of off the top of my head would be Aegis has entry requirements however Vulnerable Not sure on reqs for joining.  Castanic Brotherhood is another good guild that does a lot of PvP.  You can almost always find members of Castanic Brotherhood out in Velika Outskirts practicing and even run into them when queuing up for s.  Castanic Brotherhood is also recruiting new members right now if Im not mistaken and no theyre not restricted to Castanic race if thats an issue for youAs someone who PvPs on healers I would like to recommend you try out Priest.  Priest has a much easier time surviving and kiting enemies during PvP which is something you have to learn how to do FAST or youll be dead on the floor and often times in s if you cant stay alive youll be kicked.  Mystics are great too but definitely have a higher learning curve.  Mystics revolve around CC crowd control and support Priests are your all out heal machine.  Warning you now the s community is toxic so expect to be kicked.  Another warning for PvP as a healer Youre going to be focused. Dont be surprised when people go straight for you.  Learn to kite and remind your teammates to peel if you struggle with a  certain class say Warrior for example which tends to be one people tell me they struggle with due to the fact that a Warrior can lock you down and keep you from using skills and reacting.,TeraOnline,chpit7p,1,t5_2s527

Easy to get decent stats and it requires no enchanting so no money sink involved!  Then start getting Molten Tokens Baldurs Temple Channelworks Shattered Fleet Kezzels Gorge to buy your Steadfast gear.  That will require enchanting when you get it.  So save up every piece of Tier  gear that drops because youll need it for enchanting fodder just like those weapon shards you used to use on your Avatar weapons.Alliance stuff is nice but not really essential right now they dont contribute to gearing up as much as other quests.  Work on joining a guild that will automatically put you in an Alliance and your guildmates will be able to walk you through the Alliance dailies.  Dont sweat it until then.Once you join a guild you can do other stuff like run the Nexus which is very profitable.  Its easy with a big group you literally just stand there and watch the rewards roll in.  In the meantime make gold and lots of it.  You will need it for enchanting.,TeraOnline,chsfm5x,3,t5_2s527

1238138,0,t3_289jsq,Im making a new video on sorc rotations basic and advanced and glyphs later this week mainly PvP oriented but in the mean time these guys have some good advice. The main thing is you want to couple overchannel with fire blast as much as possible. One thing to note though Overchannel is consumed by the next ability you use and this includes the ticks of hailstorm.If you are interested in PvP I would be glad to give you a rundown of techniques and general rotaions to use vs different classes. Again I am nearly all PvP oriented so rotations change based on what you hitmiss and what is off cooldown.

Its not so much pay to win as it is pay to win quickly the game is essentially designed to fill up your inventory as fast as possible and beyond a couple of bags awarded from quests the only other way to directly purchase inventory space is through the cash shop although players can then resell the bags for ingame currency.Its also very hard to get coalescent wards in NW without paying which would be roughly equivalent to if TERA made you pay to Masterwork an item.,TeraOnline,ci8xkfg,5,t5_2s527

1299468,0,t1_cifsdop,Appreciate your post  The first link was pretty much what I was looking for excluded a few things but its alright.I guess youre right about asking better questions  But its hard to asking questions about something you dont really know what it is.Take WoW for a example. You reach max level after your questing or dungeoning journey  The first thing youll get is a quest in your log automatically popping up and telling you Go HERE and youll get some starter gear for endgame. Once youre done with that it tells you JOIN THIS and youll be able to get better gear  And then everything just goes on a line until youre max geared.In Tera it all seems so blurry for newly dinged players. Im sure experienced players see the game clearly and know almost everything of whats where and where to go to do what but I just feel confused.Ill try redo a proper question list  In what order should I be doing the dungeons for gear?Lowest tier gear gt High tier gear. I obviously dont want to do low tier dungeons again once I got better gear than that  How to make out if something is really good or not? What numbers am I looking for? I know its very class dependant which stats etc but there has to be some sort of system to let me know if a item is better than another without being very experienced as a player  And I dont mean with the green numbers that says  damage or such  Im talking if two items are similar in damage but other stats are different.  Is there PvP Gear and PvE Gear?  Simple explanation of Alliances amp Factions?  Whats the current Youve basically completed the game until the next patch instanceraid?  How do I know Im gearedskilled enough for a specific instanceraid?

Pretty much the only places that require a healer are Manayas Core NM amp HM and Abcess HM because of damage ticks from mandatory debuffs that will kill you if you are not healed through them and maybe Rifts Edge unless you can literally avoid everything and dont mind running to the gate every time for lightning since you dont have anyone to plagueregress the last boss. But if youre running with  zerks you probably want to optimize one of them to tank for the party so the other  can backcrit.

As a priest I use prayer of peace and drop all agro when the reinforcements come they run right to the dps and get hit enough that they dont bother me.for your item level rationalization you said you pulled agro with a good crit.  agro is not an indication of total damage or dps.  theres a formula to it and a good crit here and there can get agro to even the worst DPS.The nd boss of ABNM targets the first person to walk down the hallway.  As long as nobody attacks the adds if the first person jumps on the wall the adds will despawn.  I do this quite often.About charms and starting the dungeon early.  A lot of the times if you pug you will find the leader doesnt realize he is lead doesnt know how to set loot and nobody has brought charms.  I particularly dont need charms to run these dungeons at a quick pace and dont see the need to toss  gold out every time I join a party so that the rest of the group does.  In general as soon as someone moves up the rest of the party does too.  If you want charms and the party has moved up simply request charms before the first boss.  Mostly every dungeon has adds before the first boss.Heres a contribution If you know how to set loot and want your loot to be set please tick the checkbox to be able to lead the party.  If you dont want to be the leader pass it afterwards.If you dont know how to set loot and you are leader heres how.the loot options UI to change this to auto roll on fodder in the Exceptions For section the dropdown Distribute change to Randomly.  Tick the checkbox for nonsoulbound items and leave it as Roll the dice.  Nonsoulbound items means bind on pickup items deva jewelry.

2694402,0,t3_2qwi77,Honestly some of the requirements that I see in LFG chat can get ridiculous some times but I can absolutely understand wanting to make sure youre bringing someone who is at least going to pull their weight.When someone applies to your group and you inspect them theyre still using the level  gear no zyrk crystals only  crystals in their weapon and stalwart crystals in their chest piece its eluding to a potential failed run for the other four members of the party. Granted you can ask them if they have other gear etc.In my opinion if you didnt care enough to get your Idoneal gear set that is GIVEN to you by following the story quests and dont care enough about using the correct crystals on your gear then I probably dont want to group with you because youre not going to be as invested in clearing BRRG as I am.Caring so little about your character is likely eluding to bad dpsspell rotation incorrect glyh setups etc. Like other people have said if you dont know the person this is all you have to judge them off of.When the expansion first came out I did several instance matched and LFG groups I had good experiences and bad experiences. With a solid group you can clear either one of those zones in  minutes maybe a little longer if your DPS is undergeared. With a bad group youre going to waste several hours to essentially walk away with little or nothing.TLDR  Many groups look for experienced people because people come unprepared and waste everyones time.

Thats right youre blind? Its okay training wheel class got you covered you only need a maximum of  fingers and long as they are evenly distributed between  hands so for those of you that survived some horrific incident where the mafia cut your fingers off this training wheel class has got you covered.  So let me list again.The requirements to play Warrior effectively are.  hands  fingers on each hand A functional half of a brain Tera account Someone to sign in for you and do other UI stuff. A working computer with a mouse and keyboardThings not required to be a good Warrior. Eyeballs completely useless aim nothing. More than  fingers you only need a small range of buttons.

Is it wrong to want them out the group when they are holding the groups progression back.  Its about progression and having a strong group.  If someones pulling low damage they can see that and find ways to improve.  You should be ashamed if your damage is really low and your gear is better than some others.

3042574,0,t1_codc1jx,It changes from patch to patch but with current content I feel that Priests are way more useful. They are better at keeping up MP of damage dealers up than Mystics which directly affect how fast can you clear dungeons. Of course you could use potions but why waste gold in super easy dungeons if you can just take a Priest with you and not worry about MP.Sorcerers are currently UP not because they are weak as a class but again because of the content which give an edge to melee DDs. Dungeons are too easy to require a tank so many runs are tankless  bosses moving around and turning a lot. Without mobility of Slayer Warrior or even Berserker Sorcerer cant deliver comparable DPS because its physically impossible to be on the back of the boss all the time. That might change though when we get hardmodes that require proper tanking.Sorcerers are also way harder to play now since Nova skill has limited range which forces this glass cannon class into melee combat. And multitude of skills and very tight skill rotations make this class very hard to play for beginners.Overall I would recommend a melee DD preferably Slayer or Berserker since they are powerful now and rather easy to play. ,TeraOnline,codd1f3,1,t5_2s527

Redesign typical for FP games is mainly about making game easier in order to close the gap between casual and hardcore players. Its more about time spent and luck than about players skill.The question is whether youd enjoy it? Do you like games that try to stop elite from being elite just to make wallet warriors happy and feel enabled? Would you like to play a game where only  of effort you need to put into reaping rewards like new best gear depends on your skill as a gamer and remaining  is a mindless grind of dumbed down content to encourage you to throw some money at the game?My answer to you is yes you can do anything in this game for free. The point is you dont want to. Belive me you really dont. You want to do only part of it part that is challenging as much as it can be recently that is fun for you to play.

3194590,0,t3_2wpb9b,For Lance Rolls I would go Cool Down Reduction Crit Rate  damage and last Crit Damage or Attack Speed if you have a th roll.For Armor  HP Regen per   decreased damage If you have a th slot Either heal per hit or another type of decreased damage. However VM has  PVP damage I think so take that if youre using it and I am not sure if reflect works off block or not but if it does that might be a nice stat to consider if youre not using VM.For Berserkers its pretty much the same thing in armor but dont even consider heal per hit.  As for Berserker weapon probably prioritize attack speed over the  and dnt consider crit damage cause the others are all much better. If you do consider it do it instead of  damage.For boots go with Endurance Movement speed Regen per Id say thats probably regardless of class I mean the last one can be rerolled for classes that dont use regen that well but there isnt much else to put on it maybe decreased slow.For Gloves Crit Rate Power Endurance For berserker I think there are some who take AS but Id never recomend it  isnt as good as EnduranceAs for Jewelry every class uses the same  rolls ideally . hp and  reduced stun duration the only other thing worth considering is . hp per  but the other two are just too good to pass up most of the time.For rings its pretty much just Crit Rate and Crit Damage Idt people really know which they prefer take either both are good.Necklace gets a single roll again same as rings Crit or Crit damage.All of this advice is for PvP assuming you are using the current line of PvP gear.,TeraOnline,cot4at3,2,t5_2s527

If you multibox then you must control your accounts manually.In other words dont code up scripts that will play characters separately for example coding a script that plays a priest as a bot for your warrior.  As far as using programs like ISBoxer it sends identical keyboard and mouse input to multiple game windows is concerned Id be inclined to think that its OK since youre actually controlling every character.  Of course that limits you to more simplistic activities like harvesting or controlling a group of identical characters.  Harvesting would probably only work well with the Felicity pet due to character collision mechanics preventing too many characters from clustering around a node try to dodge that with scripts and youre probably back in the realm of banworthy offenses.,TeraOnline,cqis1o3,3,t5_2s527

In addition to this run RG for Firebeat ring.  You want a lot of power but also some crit rate too for skills like burst fire that dont have high crit chance or crit chance glyphs.  Ideally you should have Firetune rings and earring Deathwise necklace and earring.  Deathwise earring comes from Vault both solo and  man.  If you havent already join a guild in an alliance so you can do vault.  Deathwise necklace costs  Bellicarium credits so spam CS and Kumasylum.Ambit gear is recommended for going into BRHM or SCNM Sky Cruiser Endeavor at least masterwork  unless you feel comfortable with running harder dungeons in idoneal and find a group willing to take you but the dungeons will hurt so since youre a new player I dont recommend jumping right into the harder dungeons.After Ambit you work your way to Discovery brhm and scnm both drop discovery or craft Generation for the extra epeen if you have a few hundred thousand gold to throw away.l ,TeraOnline,cr6c88l,2,t5_2s527

You also have access to kick and stun trap. As well as stagger on rapid fire. Thats  skills that are used by archers in PvP. Against most new people you can easily do staggergtkickgtstun trapgtradiant arrow to the back for ez damage. Zerks Err I dont have much experience with zerks so Ill hold off on them. Lancer You have access to  stuns shield barrage shield bash leash kinda. You also have good damage on spring attack and a kd on wallop. A self heal is also really nice. If youre good enough with block canceling you can abuse lancer combo attack. Charge is nice to catch up to those ranged players. Mystic Heals CC damage jaunt are all available to you by . Good luck finding a class that can stick to you enough to kill you through your heals. Priest Heal Thyself self cleanse slow and fiery escape shocking implosion into kd. And a sleep that destroys people who dont know how to iframe. Against lower skilled players who dont know how to stick and pressure people youll be nigh unkillable. But itll be significnatly more annoying trying to kill someone. Sorc With the proper glyphs you can do ice needlegtsleepgtfireblast. Though youll probably have to time gyre first. Honestly sorc will wreck most melees. As a sorc you will have Time gyre sleep kd trap stun trap  ice needle glacial retreat backstep and tp jaunt to get away and cc your opponents. Not to mention flaming barrage is basically ez free damage on ppl who dont know how to iframe  . This is just my quick analysis on the classes and what they can do  level . Overall rangedgtgtgtgtgtmelee. In both duels and especially so in CS. But tbh you should really just play what you like. Warriors and Slayers are both incredibly strong  endgame.

Upon completion you will receive a full set of Idoneal gear which serves as a good baseline while you grind for the better sets.In terms of PvP armor the hierarchy is as followsControvert gt Defiance gt Renegade VMBiSThe way you obtain them is pretty simple.

4130150,0,t3_37yzsj,Sry if Im repeating what someone else said here but there are different ways to deal with damage mitigation. And yeah priest dps is not even close to an actual dps class not archer not anything.Make sure hes using the correct crystals you usually want Fine Hardy or plain Hardy will do.Check the mobs lvl hes fighting and then look at his gear you usually want nonenchantable gear if you are on the cheap side or Echantable gear  if you have  pieces of  armor thats the same lvl as the mobs you are fighting you should be able to practically face tank anything.the reason you might be doing more damage than him is the weapon Im taking a guess here but you might have an avatar weapon thats close to your lvlthe mobs lvl and he doesnt. Once he gets the avatar weapon thats similar to the bams lvl or any moster for the matter he should be onetwo shoting everything the other thing that might come to mind is crystal set up and positioning if hes not backcriting hes not doing even  of the damage he could be doing... and the other thing is player skill this just comes with time and practice.,TeraOnline,crr27ar,2,t5_2s527
4141580,0,t1_crsbjyo,I had a blast hitting  on my gunner. When I found out my option after the nonstop fun in dungeons and farming BAMs was to manually travel everywhere have no good dungeons that gave expgear and start an endless grind for the ridiculous endgame stuff that youre describing it totally killed my interest in the game. I strongly feel that this XP promotion and the whole way they restructured the leveling process should a have carried over all the way to the newest content and b was intentionally designed to get people invested in the game so theyd get into the content where you needed the special mats they sell in the store that cost you a buttload to  or whatever your gear. I really truly felt more than any game in recent memory that my experience from  was a bait and switch compared to what waits for you at  and then at . I hate bringing up WoW but if you level to cap in WoW theres a clear progression path. Quest gear gt man normals gear gt man heroics gear gt LFR gear  Crafted gear gt Normal mode gt mythic mode. The gear at each previous level is more than sufficient to get you into the next mode and failing that theres numerous catchup mechanism and theyre all very accessible and readily available to new players without having to form your own group or get carried.

4153965,0,t1_crtq1iu,Brnm is a healer carried instance imo. You did fine. The guy was fine. My biggest issue was that of his mentality. He complained that nobody would take him on runs and that the community is elitist. But he had  green crystals in  red crystals for flat boss damage and  lvl  hp crystals. Like  effort what so ever. And his reasoning was that he was saving money for his generation set and buying crystals with vg credits would slow that down. Then the notion that back crit and power crystals are worthless since a good dps should always be moving and therefore you cant hit the bosses back consistently enough to be worth it and relying on crits is stupid and any dps who uses them doesnt think for themselves. W.e. People will be themselves for better or worse and some people cant accept anything unless its first hand and their choice and thats fine.To be fair he did like standing in front of the boss and shooting so maybe my recommendation of crystals was wrong for him. ,TeraOnline,crtrk7a,5,t5_2s527

4222968,0,t1_cs1ld8z,Yeah people care more about experience which is a problem if you havent run much and want to get the experience. Even just making an LFG post inviting ambit players is difficult too I tried a SCNM earlier with an ambit party and we didnt clear the first room fast enough so there was a bunch of trash mobs still running around while we fought the boss and our tank DCed so we pretty much did it  man while being chased by mobs. We did get to the second boss without wiping but then the tank first time and didnt know any of the mechanics ran into the room before the party was ready so one person got stuck outside. Then they didnt help block any of the lasers so only  were blocking so we wiped pretty quickly then they quit the party and we just disbanded. It was my first time in the dungeon too but I watched a guide first so I would know the important mechanics but plenty of players dont which makes Ambitlearning runs hard when people dont know what to do then quit the party after wiping.,TeraOnline,cs1lj1n,1,t5_2s527

4324528,0,t3_3ahul3,Not to minimize the complaint in any way but this is a pretty common problem in game design and SFampF race design in general. A lot of designers are reluctant to make the women of large races anywhere near as big and burly or big and fat as the guys nor even give them equally as nonhuman or monstrous of faces. This is partially because they expect that a lot of their fans will be straight guys and want to provide fanservice and partly because of ideas that women arent or shouldnt be big and muscular which it seems a bit silly to apply to nonhumans but whatever. So theyll go all out with the male design and then create something pretty different and generally more humanlike for the female design.,TeraOnline,csd3q1i,2,t5_2s527

4381050,0,t1_csjh9sq,Heres the Urban Dictionary definition of lolita  gtLolita is a nickname for Delores.  It is also a term used to describe a prepubescent or adolescent girl who is attractive and sexually responsive.  She lusts after older men and is lusted by them in return.  The term originates from the Vladimir Nabakov novel Lolita which told the tale of the love affair between middle aged Humbert and his  year old stepdaughter Lolita.  It became a popular term in the s when the teenaged Amy Fisher who shot the wife of her older lover Joey Buttafauco was called The Long Island Lolita.  The term was also used a lot during the controversy surrounding the s remake of the  film version of Lolita directed by the late Stanley Kubrick.  The film which starred Jeremy Irons and was directed by Adrian Lyne had trouble finding backers due to the controversial subject matter.   year old Dominique Swain played the title character and the fact that a child actress was playing an underaged character involved with sex with adults fueled the controversy.  Lolita is also used as a euphemism for child erotica child porn or barely legal adult porn.My  year old daughter is starting to act like a lolita.Amy Fisher the Long Island Lolita was arraigned today.I just saw the new version of Lolita and its better than the  version.about | flag for glitch | Summon urbanbot what is something?,TeraOnline,csjhad3,1,t5_2s527

4559550,0,t3_3di76s,You dont have  gloves that will give you an extra  aggro from attacks. Im seriously doubting you will get into an AIHM with Fulminate gear as the tank. You need to pop noc onslaught scrolls bravery etc on bosses too. Etchings help too. Also  chest  boots gets you  more endurance which is huge. BTW what rolls did you get on your weapon?What crystals are you running? And what do you have glyphed?Make sure you glyph shield barrage for  more aggro generation dmg on wallop and spring attack increased aggro where you can and dmg on attacks and shield counter whenever possible and glyph for shield counter increased aggro too. Also generation geared dps can easily pull aggro off of you if they dont eclipse pot. If they dont hold back a little its unlikely you will hold aggro against them in a standard tank and spank. Shout when up you can save infuriate too pop adrenaline rush use empowered or quick carve brooches to get aggro back. ,TeraOnline,ct5ckoe,3,t5_2s527

4861315,0,t1_cu63woi, Healing in this game is really easy. The main difficulty comes from party members refusing to cooperate i.e. standing in range of AoE spells or picking up motes and fighting the controlsUI lockon skills are weird. Mystics suffer from it more than Priests due to all their skills having harsher positional requirements.   Utility is mostly mirrored every healer gets a party mana recovery an Offensive buff and an Endurance debuff. Currently Priests are strictly better as far as effective healing goes. Artifact Weapons make leveling content trivial since everything dies so quickly. But in general TERA suffers from a lack of PvE variety every BAM of the same type will have the same basic skillset. With bosses having a few unique mechanics thrown in.   There are no mana problems at level  unless you die and lose your Infused Charm. Healing is really all about dodging fire keeping buffsdebuffs up and healing people with the primary difference being that your healing range is really short.   tldr Healing is easy. Combat is unique and fun. If youre expecting an epic raiding endgame this isnt the game for you.,TeraOnline,cu7b086,1,t5_2s527

I guess healers can complain the most from this due to how bad the leveling gear is and how little they heal but still we all have managed. I havent level anything in the last month but I belive nothing have change in those dungeons and maybe MCat is the only one who would be dangerous for a fresh  but certanly it is doable you just have to be patience and not expect a faceroll run.                   You shouldnt believe everything people says not only in game but everywhere My lancer has schima weapon and the rest is fully worth since it is an alt that I only use for ainm runs I didnt see the point in gearing her up further than that I do perfectly fine with my set havent have major issues holding aggroo but for example my reaper skipped worth completly all this before they gifted schima at ainm how did I do this ? I went to aihm gear runs they were slow a lot of times we would wipe but at the end I got my gear not a big deal and well it is hard to enchant because this gear will give you the option to skip worth  the next patch and possible complete the end game dungeon wich now its shit and can be done in worth but in the past it was pretty important.     I started playing at Rift Edge patch I was   new to the game and mmo overall people told me just skip patron ambit  and go for devastator schima  I went to rehm and I realize Hey I cant skip patron cause Im a walking  shoot I dont want to get carry  so I did my fair share of renm got my full set patron then went to rehm where I got my devastator and then to abhm where I got my Amelior I didnt quit once stop playing cause devastator was too hard or cause I didnt have enough gold. Instead I went out of my way to farm gold and spend most of my days doing alliance and nexus funny thing most of my friends would farm LoT but since I was a priest that was pretty much out of the question.         Gearing up is part of this game rng is also part of this game the sooner we acept it the better and if people decide to rage quit cause they are unable to gear up or they are frustated they should find an easier game to play cuase Tera is alredy easy enough pretty much you can get everything you need for enchanting out of ainm without spending  gold taking away mes or bes.,TeraOnline,cure8lm,0,t5_2s527

5459370,0,t3_3pskqh,CC had always been a function of crit factor  crit resist. I did testing in PvP a year ago to confirm this.Because the maths is done well and Im sure the testing is too the general structure of that formula may be correct. There is  major critique I have with thisIf you look at the front PvP hits slope and front PvE hits they dont line up. This means the hypothetical  crit resist for Kumas is probably wrong. Although this will not change the general structure of the formula all the coefficients may be off.If you look at the PvP graph  CC on AA is about . while PvE it is .. If . is equal to PvP . then real Kumas have a C res of almost . If we consider the PvP base crit at  bonus like the chart showed Kumas have a C res of about  close to what I found.If that is true we can approximate crit chance on Kumas to be .  crit factor  c res  . if back. This would make perfect sense if preArun bosses had C res around .Also it is generally accepted that empirically crit is about  lower chance from the front but this experiment apparently tells us that front crits arent bad... if this is true when front crit and side crit crystals come out  DPS  healer front spam might work out to be pretty decent. It will bypass reposition and allow you to possibly do more DPS in a real fight.

I doubt those  people are skilled with their class if you say your gear wasnt even rolled.Can confirm that glyph is bad comparatively to some alternatives. ToB only makes up less than  of your total aggro generation  if you cannot scythe source The only reason ToB is a good skill is because it reduces aggro of party members and I agree that it should not be glyphed unless you cannot scythe.Also Im no the OP you responded to but you shouldnt need to resort to personal attacks.

5932945,0,t1_cxxb3mm,Class balance in Tera isnt particularly stellar but its not broken to the point of a class doing x the damage the weakest class can put out. BHS isnt amazing at class balance but at least they kind of try.At worst I would say the weakest dps will do about  of the max. damage of the top classes when played at their highest potential. This changes as patches come and go theyre always buffingnerfing the classes that need it. Also need to throw in the fact that high skill floorsceilings are a thing in this game. Nearperfect dps is significantly harder than in your traditional tab targetting MMOs. A lot of classes have a high skill floor and skill ceiling and can easily outdps most above averagegood players on better classes.,TeraOnline,cxxc8dc,4,t5_2s527

6038914,0,t1_cyb36ex,I actually run with two DPS wars in my static. I do agree that it takes tremendous coordination to make it viable however which is not something youll find it PUGs. Were on voice chat every time we run and if theyre both on their warriors rather than alts they alternate broochDG burns so that theyre not wasted. Id dare to say that its not any slower than other party makeups but I dont have any math to back it up. But theyve been running together as double war for months now so theyre extremely attuned to each other and both skilled enough with warrior to build edge too fast for only one to use.Its certainly a viable option but its not something I would ever do in PUGs. Sometimes wed let a second DPS war into a raid in AINMHM but we tried to avoid it unless they were a friend due to the lack of coordination.Edit One thing I would say about warriors is that I completely agree theyre a hard class to master. The only harder one is sorc IMO because their rotation is a lot more strict. Knowing which skills chain into what and which filler skills to use between CDs makes the difference between a mediocrebad DPS war and a very good one. Its not an easy class to pick up and takes practice to get good at.,TeraOnline,cyb7p6n,1,t5_2s527

Speed top roll flat back and kd Dmg on the bottom or CD for one of them with this your main focus is to kd chain them as much as possible but this is a pretty basic build and if you switch to A stance youd do fine in a  v X situation just gotta watch your mana and hp. ,TeraOnline,cygp3tu,1,t5_2s527
6084739,0,t3_3yw5ou,from dps point of view its all about positioning and buff  debuffs for the whole group if the tank can keep the mobsboss in one place and keep the back to the dps it would be awesome easier to get back crit and the debuffbuff will increase the overall dps  from the healer point of view i really like a tank when he know how and when to block  evade  getting agro from minions that usually agro the healers since some tank didnt agro them at first. so if the tank can minimize the damage he received and keep the mobs from attacking the team it would be easier for healer to do their jobs.  thats just my opinion though other may have different point of view.,TeraOnline,cyh6tsb,1,t5_2s527

6563860,0,t1_czy8yrs,For the purposes of data collection Im generally not too worried about what DPS you do because it can vary by quite a large amount due to gearconsumablesetc. As long as you do decent DPS it doesnt really matter what your DPS actually is because we can assume youre doing a decent rotation. But if your DPS is low then that indicates somethings gone terribly wrong and Id have to keep that in mind when analysing your data.Dont worry too much about what extra buffs you have. Charms  scroll  nostrum should be enough to get you beyond decent DPS and anything over that is not really relevant to me.Personally though I am pretty curious as to whats going on.  ,TeraOnline,czy9apb,1,t5_2s527

6779641,0,t3_48lbp6,Ive been playing TERA for  years now and for the first time I dont want to play any more.When the level cap was  daily green quests Jax Trust Velika Bastion etc. were fast around  mins and earned approx.  gold with elite.  Nexus gave another  gold plus MES fodder etc.  So MWA was more expensive but the gold earning was there so people could buy it fairly easily PLUS you could farm KN and LoT for MWA  unlimited runs all day if you wanted.When the level cap was first raised Vanguard dailies paid less gold but the credits enabled you to buy MWA boxes after the community complained and EME added them to the store PLUS you could still farm KN and LoT for MWA which was eventually removed but then we had TAR.  Dreamstorm and Ghillieglade added more gold MES etc.With this new patch  I dont know how to earn decent gold anymore.  And  per day doesnt cut it when there is NO OTHER WAY of farming MWA.  My guildees have already cancelled elite and I would except I locked in the .month price and I am going to give EME a month to fix things before I cancel elite too.Question for people familiar with KTERA  how do they earn gold and MWA  I know they have other ways?

7081960,0,t3_4ckyob,To be honest this could go either way theres no telling because we have no proof. The portrayal of both Danicia and Spacecats by this alleged EME employee is almost cartoonish though and that sounds fishy to me.Regardless we dont need any EME staff or exstaff to come and tell us the level of communication in general isnt ideal that BHS doesnt really care much for NA feedback or that the game isnt doing too hot because thats been made clear to us in various instances for months now.Two things need to change for things to start going better.First BHS needs to start really listening to feedback regarding content and class balance and doing sensible changes and not halfassed crap such as a passive skill for archers that doesnt even work properly or nerfs to the OP classes that arent even a slap on the wrist because they change nothing.Second communication between EME and BHS needs to be more efficient and fast to bring changes faster to us. And I dont mean it for whole big patches I mean for things that we should be able to get within reasonable time frames instead of having to wait for months and months and then its too late for example solutions to unrewarding drop tables.Do I have any hope for that? Not really. BHSs mindset seems to be what youd expect out of a Korean MMO company. Ill just play while Im able to enjoy the game for what it is and move on when I finally cant bother anymore. Im kind of stubborn though so Ill continue giving my two cents where I can.One last thing this might sound stupid. Assuming he really works at EME why is this guy not a Community Manager for Tera he seems to know a lot about the game and very connected with the issues players have...

But few patches later VM got its  damage reduction overline stat back and as it is now it completely demolishes VM in terms of stats. Has the same stats only at  it actually has still more defense than  Starfall chest. If you dont plan on ing your armor the difference between  VM and  VM is so big that it makes it look as if Starfall was introduced not one but two patches before VM.Only invest in full Starfall if you are short on funds obviously it will be cheaper to make Starfall armor than VM or if you plan on doing some pvp. ,TeraOnline,d35je72,1,t5_2s527

They just had high aggro modifier on FB which gave the illusion of high DPS. Theyre still viable. Warp barrier is great for cheating mechanics and the AoE is nice too. Solowise theyre great for leveling but at endgame Im not a fan of using them for IoD dailies. I dont think they solo bams as well as most of the other classes. Just play whichever one you like or even both. Slayer is generally better for PvE but sorc has its uses too.

My lancer takes more damage from the same hits than my brawler. mobility wise for small movement lancer wins because of shield barrage but for anything else brawler is way better. bullrush moves you farther and you dont really have to worry about colliding with anything lancers charge stops if you run into anything. brawlers iframe is longer and you dont have to worry about attacking the boss if you want to use it again as soon as it is off CD. lancer if you have to iframe multiple times in a row you wont even have the resolve to block the RE change was a nerf not a buff Also there is no beating a free nd life every mins. In terms of over all party effectiveness for mobs  brawler takes it over lancer. Lancer is shit tier compared to brawlers when it comes to CC. as for boss fights they are pretty close now and comes more down to which boss you are fighting and if you could keep up GF on the brawler.  ,TeraOnline,d49gmhs,3,t5_2s527

Doing quests in dungeons more or less just wastes a lot of time and its much more efficient just to clear it and reset and clear.

Oh sure theres going to be people telling you go one or the other but youll find one of the two that youll like.   Play both classes through the Intro area and see which you like more.  Brawler has a bit more damage output but lancer is more Classic Tank.Whomever is going to be healing should do the same play Priest or Mystic  Priest is far more Dedicated Healer Mystic is perfectly capable but has a bit more swiss army knife.    The other three should be focusing on DPS.  Let them pick what they like theyll be sticking with it for the whole game too.  You could argue which class is bestest but really?  the newer ones are higher DPS but the others are Just As Good With Friends.Seriously unless youre trying to minmax and turn this game into a job dont take it seriously.

Depore used to get hate on VoT for the same reason hed go on rants about things that werent really important or were opinionbased. that is why you two form the supergroupim sure youve seen the merged name.you just need learn to be a tad quiet and not take offense to others ppls opinions. as you mentioned it is a game and people have different ideas of what they find fun. your complaint about being killed for no reason on a pvp server is a pretty stupid one as the server is labeled a pvp onenote i joined VoT as it was recommended didnt realize it was pvp till i got to popolion but it was never too bad. if being harassed by people is too much of an inconvenience for you you should have probably transferred to a pve server a while ago. i think you actually enjoy this and are not aware yet.good luck with the merge try to be more calm.,TeraOnline,d6xe2x4,6,t5_2s527

9103942,0,t3_54yelw,This is why I just DPS when I level healers. Since a lot of people are new they dont take full advantage of crystals glyphs and positioning so you end up usually doing much more DPS than them and speed up the dungeon a lot.But yes usually not much going on early game to make you feel useful healingwise. Leveling in Tera is nowadays designed to be rushed through with little difficulty. As others mentioned focus more on using Triple Nemesis glyphed for endurance debuff Energy Stars fully glyphed and Mana Charge this is your support rotation. Throw a heal here and there a well placed Restorative Burst is gonna take care of most of it and at endgame its gonna have a mana restore glyph so get used to spamming this too and do some DPS on the boss if you feel like it. At endgame youll usually have to be healing a lot more while using the previously mentioned support rotation at the same time.,TeraOnline,d865bqh,3,t5_2s527

For archers try to get near  crit rate since base is . Bench mark attack speeds for doing your combo are  bench mark to get out of combos full brawler attack speed Prob gt  double energetic iiis double attack speed rolls on weap  Bravery I recommend anywhere between  through  Attack speed. As far as rolls go I PVE as well and only have  bow so I use  AS Top  Behind  flat  critpower  CDR  with Power III Etch and Energetic III On Glove. Having a Heavens Elixir is also beneficial towards stats and will boost crit by .Ive tested this over and over and over again in duels full crit gt double crit and its not the way to go. I went full crit accessories and tested a RoA VS Non Crit and youre gonna be upset but like opening lootboxes its RNG. Like I said theres so much crit resist and in Big group PVP You generally want more white dmg. White dmgnon crits Will be way higher as well which is important for consistant burst aoe dmg on a groundpound  giga.

If it is not you have many other choices and options in other playstyles or games that may be worth your investment.I personally do not like Elins.

10985173,0,t3_5wrznu,Tera dps is very reliant on back crits which means that ALL dps classes have to maintain as high back time as possible by that i mean positioning is important for ALL dps. As for movements Archers tend to move in towards the boss and back away a lot to set up traps ROA skills that require a certain distance. Reapers also move out with pendulum to use whipsaw and then back in with grimsunderingcable. Both are leather classes both reasonably durable archers recently got buffed and are at a very good position right now and reapers are soon getting buffed which will help them catch up in dps a lot.Shiny armour wise... there are plenty of costumes out there its how the game makes most of its money so they do put SOME effort into the design. One piece of advice try thing on before u buy them it will save you a LOT of money.Server selection is region dependant. In EU Mystel is a safe choice it has the highest population so you are bound to find someone you get along with. For NA i guess Tempest Reach or Mount Tyrannus are the equivalent but someone who actually plays on NA can verify that.P.S.

Without any crit in their builds everything else has an abysmal crit chance.Zerkers are also easily one of the strongest classes right now.Then you have to go into the issue of having to prestack Ragnarok before every fight to sync up with  enrage which wastes your partys time more than Lancers stacking.,TeraOnline,dg246ts,1,t5_2s527

11615037,1,t3_65qzbj,Well to start you got Lancers they do the least amount of damage of any class aside from healers and in most cases do less than one of the healers. They got great CC and decent buffs but the CC is hard to land and the buffs fall short of actually being worth it most of the time. Overall a bad class but that doesnt mean a good player on one cant be threatening.Then you have Slayers if they were good theyd be overpowered they do a ton of damage but most of their shit is difficult to land the stuff that is easy to land has a ton of counter play Backstab is a snare and stunning backhand has no duration They can be good but theyre hard to play and unless you like the class for aesthetic reasons Id say theyre not worth playing either.Berserkers are at the point where the game starts to get a little easier Berserkers at their best are another difficult class to play but when fighting mediocre or bad players you dont have to be that good yourself just charge up and run at them dodge what you can and smash em for most of their hp. When you fight someone who knows what their doing the class actually gets really hard though unlike Slayers they are better equipped to actually deal with good players but its definitely harder than a lot of other classes. Speed in everything you do is important to a berserker lots of animation canceling and lots of practice required.Ninjas are okay they rely pretty heavily on gear because theyre not really that good in a fight they catch someone in a hard to land CC then they press buttons and hopefully when they are done the enemy is dead it can and does happen but when it doesnt they dont do a lot IIRC I used to hear people call Ninjas a hit and run class Im starting to think this is what they mean Ninja does its thing and when it fails it runs away to wait for another opportunity. Ninjas are also owners of the worst skill in the game its a trap move that actually has a lot of things going for it but way more issues than should ever be considered worth using.Reapers attack fast but lack skills spacing out your skills is very important as a reaper not only to prevent them all from going on CD but to permanently stagger your opponents and make them not want to fight you. Reapers got okay defensive options mostly just what ninja has  the fact that they are ranged Retribution is lower CD than Smoke Bomb so arguably better. The biggest thing about Reaper though is just how hard they are to play against due to the fact that they have a huge advantage in the most important stat in the game.Sorcerer is another class that is super easy against bad players but requires some effort vs people who know the game. Sorcerer can do a lot of damage with a sleep combo and thanks to time gyre the dumbest lock on in the game landing said sleep combo is childs play. That said anyone who knows the class well is gonna be careful of this and some classes even have answers to time gyre most classes if theyre willing to give up important shit for it That basically means you gotta land the sleep combo without it which isnt the hardest thing in the game but its not effortless either.Gunners have the least amount of good moves in the entire game they basically have nothing but what little they do have is S tier they have a slow moving skill shot that they can detonate for over half your hp and its explosion radius is ridiculous Like m out each way AT LEAST Theyve got a big damage laser that always crits but it unlikely to hit in smaller scale PvP. Lastly they have a robot that heals them for ridiculous amounts regardless of what anyone says its not actually that much compared to the damage a DPS class can do but Lancers and Healers basically have no chance vs this class. It heals like k hp every  seconds its manageable and not enough to make anyone think the class is good but it is stupid.Brawlers used to have a lot going for them now the only things they really got are Ground Pound an easy to land AoE knock up that with enough AS is near unavoidable as well as the fact that half the shit they use blocks theyre annoying to fight but low AS Brawlers are pretty awful and if you have a way to deal with  survive ground pound its on a high enough that most classes can kill when full built. I would call it another hit and run class but since they block so much they dont run as much as they do just stall and block everything. Definitely not a difficult class though.Archers used to be a ridiculous melee class with  big weakness that made them useless despite being the best that was that if you dont want to fight an archer you dont have to no matter your class you could get away from an archer they had no chase potential. So even though they one combo you with some of the dumbest shit in the game they werent that big a deal then Blow Hole Studios had the genius idea to give them a dash that up until that point was restricted to true melee classes. If youre a melee class archers fuck you if you beat an archer v as a melee class without backstab ever you are the better player no room for debate this class is easy and a complete counter to melee classes. As a whole this is the most horrible idea for a class in the entire game but there is at least one more OP than this.Warriors are the most overpowered class in the game. A lot of classes have low skill floors but most of those classes arent that hard to deal with so even though a Berserker or Sorcerer will completely dominate a noobie that doesnt last long you find players that can deal with it pretty quick. Warrior is not like that at all. Most of the people who claim its not that bad still get owned because Warriors have a skill that allows them to gap close and stun you with no effort and then they just kill you before you can play again. There used to be minor ways of dealing with it aside from predicting but Blow Hole has set out to remove all of those. Now your options are predict and then iFrame or Block. iFraming it is extremely difficult blocking it is above moderately difficult. There are signs that a warrior is about to back stab you but none of them actually matter because they can delay it as much as they want. This is the class you should recommend to a  year old if you wanna play with them. Little Brother lancer is too difficult for you to handle play this one its basically the same but way easier and way more damage.Lastly you have the new class Lunar Dancer. They kind of take what made Warriors so OP and they tone it down a bit theyre still an easy class but they provide the illusion of skill while also having tons of neat shit to deal with other classes like a  hit shield Idk if it blocks CC yet but thatd be a wicked counter to backstab The class is dumb and probably shouldnt exist but it does have the coolest weapon in the game itll get nerfed eventually but probably never get the nerf it deserves which is to remove the stagger on its backstab. Your younger brother is now  hes sick of being babied but he still sucks and requires it to do anything this is the class you give him good way to practice getting good at the game without actually having to be any bit good at the game.The healers are healers not much to say you either like being a full on support or you dont Mystics are fun v but nobody would ever v you so there is no point you got the one that has a ton of healing mobility and a really good shield or the one with lots of CC crit aura and miscellaneous shit.,TeraOnline,dgckp1g,-1,t5_2s527

11638029,0,t1_dgf64zf,O.o do you even read guides?  One of your highest dps skills Rapid Fire is one of the most ping reliant skills in this game.  Anyhow high elf males seem to have slightly slower animations and amani is just plain awfully slow.  With  ping i would reconsider using Rapid Fire as part of my rotation or if you care about your damage use fastfire injector at your own risk.,TeraOnline,dgf6mep,2,t5_2s527
11638934,0,t3_6623py,In case you havent noticed Instance Matching System for level  is cancerous thing you can possiblity experience in TERA. People make up their own rules no matter how well you do there will always be that one person that will never be happy. Which is why LFGGuildiesFriends is how you survive the harsh community of TERA. Also you can have  full Guile with yellow rolls on them but you mostly need to roll them that fits with the meta. If I see a  Guile weapon rolled for Crit Factor x crit damage and attack speed then prepare to be kicked even if your item level exceeded the cancerous instance matching system recommendation. Like this individual that made me puke. The crystal and rolls are atrocious and yet it still gives maximum item level regardless. I wouldnt be taking this sorc into my runs. ,TeraOnline,dgfabj8,1,t5_2s527
