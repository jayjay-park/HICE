Over and over and over all for nothing more than a little digital token saying we did.Well punish our selfs doing things others would consider torture because we think its fun.Well spend most if not all of our free time min maxing the stats of a fictional character all to draw out a single extra point of damage per second.Many of us have made careers out of doing just these things slogging through the grind all day the same quests over and over hundreds of times to the point where we know evety little detail such that some have attained such gamer nirvana that they can literally play these games blindfolded.Do these people have any idea how many controllers have been smashed systems over heated disks and carts destroyed n frustration? All to latter be referred to as bragging rights?These people honestly think this is a battle they can win? They take our media? Were already building a new one without them. They take our devs? Gamers arent shy about throwing their money else where or even making the games our selves. They think calling us racist mysoginistic rape apologists is going to change us?

Our obsession with proving we can after being told we cant is so deeply ingrained from years of dealing with big brotherssisters and friends laughing at how pathetic we used to be that proving you people wrong has become a very real need a honed reflex.Gamers are competative hard core by nature.

7022985,0,t1_d1cbozq,People crucify me for this but I think this is the best AC game to ever be released. Warning Big wall of text ahead. First the gameplay difficulty scales well no counter spam or finisher comboing scrubiness that happened in previous games mash attack until you kill someone then jump from an enemy to the next one. Enemies are more than just a nuisance and this time if youre not careful youll get outnumbered and probably die. The weapon types are pretty varied and distinct combat is fun pacing and speed is excellent gadgets are cool and the free run mechanics are a bliss once you get hold of the controls. Crowds provide nice strategical variety in infiltration enterable buildings make for enjoyable vertical gameplay the three factions guards extremists and revolutionaries provide some interesting combat situations the mission variety is pretty wide and side quests are actually fun murder mysteries and enigmas are a very welcome addition. Plus if youre a collector like me there are hundreds of things to keep you occupied throughout Paris. Equipment customization is a bliss of its own. Setting revolutionary Paris is the perfect setting for an AC game. The period allows the medieval with modern mix to be historically accurate without sounding too far fetched like Syndicate plus it is the only game where I dont feel weird by walking around dressed as an assassin with a weapon in my hipback and being unnoticed since a lot of people walked with weapons fearing for their safety during the revolution and the periods attire was colorful and pompous even for the lower classes. The feeling of walking around the streets and watching people fightingshoutingdoing random things is absolutely immersive. There must be a hundred or so random things pedestrians and crowds do from throwing chairs into a bonfire to hurriedly hauling stolen artifacts from churches. The environment is pretty varied as well each area is somewhat different from the other. Plot the only thing I liked but not loved in this game. Cant say anything without spoiling it but sometimes its predictable and other times it offers some wild plot twists. I think the main critique of Unity made by AC fans was that the game didnt focus on the modern day plot which I found pretty tedious and boring IMHO so this counted as a plus for meGraphics are beautiful and AC Unity is definitely the best looking game Ive ever played. Even its successor Syndicate and Ubisofts golden boy The Division arent on the same level as Unity. Baked GI really makes a huge difference and HDR among other techniques makes everything look photorealistic. NPC density is glorious and really help making the world a lot more believable animations are superb and texture work is excellent. Hundreds of buildings have enterable interiors which are as incredibly well designed. The only negatives are poor draw distance noticeable popup and distant scenery looks like puke and NPCs faces. Multiplayer is definitely fun the missions arent repetitive and if you have some buddies to play together youre going to have a pretty good time. Nowadays its a pretty stable game. Ubisoft patched the hell out of it and in my entire h playthrough only found cosmetic bugs NPCs behaving weirdly the occasional animation bug but zero gameplayimpacting bugs or glitches. The framerate isnt too good sometimes it dip into the fps range in the PS but Im not bothered by this. Overall I loved each second of playthrough. I bought the game dayone but left it aside a week after and only got to play it last month. Ubisoft gave us the Dead Kings DLC for free which was also pretty neat of their part its very good as well. Highly recommended. ,Gamingcirclejerk,d1cenqr,8,t5_2sf2b

Reading through the comments you can see where the running jerk is KotOR  is more Star Warslike while  is darker le edgier and better written but unfinished. Lol DAE TOR not exist. What they said about KotOR  is right though BioWare were looking to make a Star Wars trilogy within a single game complete with beginning with a bang to plot twist to finale with villain being sympathetic and they succeeded. Obsidian succeeded in writing some compelling stuff wrote an amazing character in KreiaTraya introduced some interesting crafting systems and expanded on the galaxy in interesting ways that were actually thoughtprovoking. But with an overlong bloated intro Shadow the Edgehog villain in Darth Sion Darth Boba Fett Effect Nihlus character arcs that are never fully resolved and an ending that would disappoint Dexter fans it doesnt ever really surpass its predecessor nor deliver on its promise of a deep plot that challenged the morality of the Star Wars universe. ,Gamingcirclejerk,d1e447d,4,t5_2sf2b

8046392,0,t3_4pf0yf,Wish me luck boys amp girls Ill be pulling some quotes from that post to critique.gt...Why would you expect it to be almost as big as the largest DLC landmass theyve ever created? Im guessing itll be similar to the Pitt pretty small but dense.gtETA Unless theres a landmass separate from the park. The wording on their site makes that seem possible. Still I doubt its going to be approaching Far Harbor in terms of size.Far Harbor was  and Nuka World is . With it only being  cheaper I think youre seriously underestimating the size of NW.gtDefinitely. Four DLC dedicated to an part of the game a lot of players just ignore is silly. Why the hell do these guys keep lumping Automatron in with the Workshop DLCs? Did they seriously just forgotten about the  hour questline two huge dungeons and large amounts of lore relating to the Robobrains? How is that possibly similar to the Workshop DLCs in any way?gtIt is lacking content tho. If you build settlements that is a huge timesink but other than that there is not much content at all. Very few quests almost a third of which are radiant quests that have no soul or story. And then what is left could be anything from Here Kitty Kitty where you find a lost cat in  seconds to that quest where you talk the raiders down from sacking the diner near the start of the game. Theres a handful of others that are just fetch quests and a small pool of well thoughtout and unique side quests. Thats really almost nothing if you compare it to any other game in the series hell even Tactics...Six upvotes for this load of rubbish.gtThe issue most people have is that Bethesda wasted resources on making the craftingsettlement system.... that could have been used to make the game more fallout. gtInstead they drifted from a fallout style game..... to Minecraft fallout....what.gtBecause writing stories quests and dialogue is hard. Its easier just to steal ideas from Modders and pass them off as your own.Six upvotes.gtI would have been happy with a fallout game to tell you the truth.It was a Fallout game as Bethesda made it so since they decide what is or isnt Fallout. Tough shit if you dont like it.gtI didnt really care for the workshop DLC but Nuka World better be Blood and Winesized for the price its at now.Not even rfallout is safe from The Witcher III circlejerk.gtThe whole game should of been an upgrade of NV but no we got a shell of its former self.I bet that if the game was literally New Vegas . a lot of these people would be bitching about Bethesda ripping off Obsidian.,Gamingcirclejerk,d4kho60,8,t5_2sf2b

This means that every area has to be self contained to allow you to go on a murder spree and the games storyprogress to not shit itself. For example Murder the Boomers well the game certainly doesnt want to stop if you do that so itll essentially shrug its shoulders and move you to the next quest but that also means it doesnt really change until once again the final quest and epilogue if you ally with them since to prevent the Boomers death from mucking things up their living cant affect too much either.,Gamingcirclejerk,d4l8t17,2,t5_2sf2b
8053464,0,t3_4phcdn,ujI have a PC gaming background and slowly moved to console for no particular reason it was sort of a natural thing. What I can remember from that time between  yo was that assembling a PC was not a particularly difficult task. All these components come with manuals and if youre not sure what to buy you could always ask a store clerk unless you buy used parts in which case youd have to be pretty sure about what you were buying.What keeps me into consoles is a mix of  things. Nowadays hardware evolves really fast. Its hard to keep up with the updates. As a gamer I like to play the games in the best settings possible. Will that game run on my PC? Uncertainty year by year. And you never stop putting money on your machine. Sure upgrades are cheaper in most cases but they never end until an essential part of your PC is a piece of trash after  or  years.. Trading. I was a hoarder until I realized I didnt have enough time to play as much as I wanted. Then Id have a pile of games I didnt play for having a sense of attachment to them. Theyre mine. I love these games. I paid for them. Last time I bought a console PS my wife was very upset. Of course nongaming wives may not understand if I already owned a desktop computer and a PS why the fuck would I need my brand new PS? She pushed me to sell my PS and to avoid conflict as smart men do I gave it for a very fair price to a close friend thinking Id like to play my old games once in a while so it wont be a problem as this guy lives close by... Never did. But I got a big chunk of my money back as I could sell the games I had separately and all are still fun functional and probably traded by someone else after around  to  years in some cases.rjSo I think those guys holding themselves back from PC gaming because they cant assemble one are utterly retarded.,Gamingcirclejerk,d4la9zk,4,t5_2sf2b

8150791,0,t3_4qsp5d,I know this is a lot of text theres a TLDR at the bottomIn the original Star Wars trilogy the Jedi were few and far in between. Only two Sith existed in the universe. Lightsabers were incredibly rare and every time they were brought out it signified an important conflict. These things were special and a lot had to happen before youd see people use the force.Then came the prequels. Suddenly there was a threecourse buffet of Jedi the Sith were disposable quickly replaced and lacked characterization and lightsabers were everywhere. Suddenly there were double lightsabers there were people using two lightsabers Im surprised General Grevious didnt use four double lightsabers for shits and giggles at some point. It made for good action sequences but the novelty of it all wore off. It was no longer special for the Jedi and the Sith to face off for the powers of the Force to be exhibited. It was just routine procedure something that was pulled out to flash in front of the audience. All that stuff that came before the Jedi and the Sith fought with lightsabers and the force? Thats gone. Scenes are categorized by an opening section where lightsabers are used and then a series of other sections that only serve to separate all the lightsaber scenes. Its just not special anymore.And then you have Fallout. If any of you played Fallout  and  youd know that power armor was extremely hard to get. It was on the cover of the game but youd go a longass time without seeing it. In Fallout New Vegas the only game that didnt have power armor on the cover you would only see the suits at Hidden Valley the Battle of Hoover Dam and on dead paladins hidden at  places on the map. And then theres deathclaws those terrifying creatures that would run faster than a motorbike and instakill you with a glomp the force of which senpai has never seen. You could finish Fallout  without ever seeing a deathclaw and when I played New Vegas the first time I only ever saw one right before it killed me on the road to New Vegas. Theres something elegant about the most iconic images of a franchise barely being seen at all. In fact its the rarity of something that keeps it from becoming the average.And then theres Bethesda. On the first mission of the minutemen questline Fallout  has you donning power armor and using a minigun to turn a deathclaw into a cobb salad. You dont even have to seek it out the event starts when you walk into Concord. Theres a threecourse buffet of power armor deathclaws are plentiful disposable and easily replaced and the ammunition for your shiny new minigun isnt hard to find. Suddenly your power armor can nullify fall damage you get night vision you get a fucking jetpack Im surprised you didnt get an Iron Man chest cannon for shits and giggles.Notice the similarities?And now for the controversial part of this massive wall of text. I know its not really popular to hate on Fallout  but it had a serious problem with this. You couldnt finish the main quest without running into the brotherhood of steel and sticking with them for a longass time. The novelty of power armor was entirely lost because it was everywhere by the time the game was over. Theres brotherhood members in power armor theres enclave members in power armor everyone has power armor by the end of it. This supposedly rare thing has become commonplace its become the norm and as such the bar is set at having power armor instead of power armor being defined by how high above the bar it rises.Fallout  and  are still entertaining to play and the Star Wars prequels are still entertaining to watch. If anyone judges you for enjoying them theyre a dick. Still its sad that the iconic parts of those franchises feel hollow and overused.TLDR Star Wars ruined the novelty of lightsabers by stuffing the prequels with them and Bethesda ruined power armor and deathclaws the same way by stuffing Fallout  and  with power armor and stuffing Fallout  with deathclaws.,Gamingcirclejerk,d4weab8,1,t5_2sf2b

8453428,0,t3_4vgqlt,This game has been decided to fail. PC gamers are smart. Theyre the smartest gamers out there. They dont think but know things other people might not and one of those things is population counts. PC gamers dont think but know that a multiplayer game like Battleborn needs players to be fun. However they also dont think but know that there simply arent enough people to go around. Between Overwatch CSGO TF CoD Battlefield hell even the MOBAs who is left to populate the Battleborn servers? PC gamers dont think but know that theres nobody left. In order to strengthen Overwatchs player counts PC gamers made a tough choice that they didnt think but knew was for the greater good. They decided Battleborn would fail. Nobody would buy it nobody would play it and all so Overwatch could be the best game it could be. Today millions of happy gamers frag out in Overwatch. Battleborn and Gearbox should just cut their losses. When PC gamers decide something its decided and no amount of dev work will change that decision. Lets just say I dont think Gearbox will hemorrhage money from this continued support.I am a bot and this action was performed automatically.

I spent about  to  hours for the platinum and it was well worth it. Only problems were that there were too many load screens.  Like seriously there was a loading screen for getting cured wtf. Also it was kinda buggy. I had my game quest bug out causing me to reload a previous save which could have happened hours ago. So some days that  hour I had to play got wasted but still that game was something else. . Star wars battlefront. Holy shiiit wat a game. I started since wensday and have  to  hours clocked in at lvl . I absolutely love it. Its like Im in the star wars movies and I love flying the fighters. My only problems is that I wish it had a campaign mode because the survial and battle missions are so lackluster.  Also hero hunt is the worst mode to ever exist in any video game ever. There are also a lot if balancing issues but I love this game. Im going to play until I at least get the platinum and I might even get the dlc,Gamingcirclejerk,d7i0plz,17,t5_2sf2b
8907552,0,t1_d7ihje1,I like the dialog wheel. In older fallout titles theyd throw in  ways of saying the same thing which led to the same response. The only thing Id add would be a biowareesque more option which had more choices. And maybe make the dialog a bit more clear.Id definitely keep the perk system IMO for an FPS the entire skill point thing was just cumbersome and this streamlines it nicely. Id also keep the voiced protag but offer a few voice options. Id keep the armor layering and all that too but more choices plz. The amount of underarmor in the game is damn near criminal and you get all of this cool clothing that you literally have no reason to ever use.Home plate was kinda ass if you ask me. Too limited you couldnt build a bunch of shit that Ida really liked to. Im with you on unique cities but to me the settlement system could interlink with that. Hell by the end of ? Its more than possible that you can control diamond city. Its time to make some improvements around here!Id keep survival mode. Id expand the settlement mode with campsites and fix the mechanics snapping especially ocdecorator would also be vanilla. Id keep the weapon and armor customization but add in a few weapon types. Id actually controversially I bet keep the magic weapons but Id also add unique variants with unique skins. As for what Id leave behind? I wouldnt include a faction if they didnt have equal quest time to everyone else looking at you minutemen. BoS has x the quests you do. and I dont know that Id include the Brotherhood at all. A few random members maybe but at this point theyre reaching Enclave levels of how are you motherfuckers everywhere at once? and its stretching belief. As well the first person to suggest a full DLC where you have to be purely evilpurely goodmade of cheeseactively on fire would be thrown from the roof of the building and replaced by someone who actually understands gamers. Id also bring back the special checks in conversation and a few more nonviolent options. I would NOT however go full New Vegas you can talk down the general that has every reason to murder you and make him leave you alone because we want options with how I did it.Automatic weapons would also receive a buff as would heavy weapons.

9052397,0,t1_d7zycep,It seems you are possibly discussing stealing or stealingrelated topics. Although this is against every countries rules and even a pesky commandment or two to those nonatheist filth its important to remember to be responsible. Content creators can only create said content because they receive funding from things you shit on.Stealing is an important freedom in our fascist dictatorships and its important to remember these things before you pass rightful judgement on thieves discussing itgt Some steal games because they believe the creator doesnt deserve financial compensation for the state of the product that was released. Those people are dicks.gt Some steal something that they already bought simply to remove the DRM. Which is just another word for stealing.gt Some steal to emulate NES games they definitely had  years ago. I signed that waiver Bill Clinton.gt Some steal to try products before they make a financial commitment to them. Just like WinZIP.gt Some steal simply because they cannot afford it. They are like Aladdin. But instead of stealing life sustaining nourishment its No Mans Sky.gt Some steal to get something thats no longer available. Nobody actually does but well leave this here because its the one of two somewhat legitimate reasons.gt Some steal because their country censors or doesnt import it. Despite the irony that pirating was stealing things from other countries this is a somewhat valid reason to do so. Please move to a new fascist dictatorship.gt Some steal games because of timed exclusivity. If they dont have access to it yet they use piracy as a method to access it before its available to them. Just like when Greg who works at Gamestop slips me a copy on Monday. Ill totally pay him er uh Gamestop later.Lastly heres a few tips AdBlock is awesome for hiding fake download links. Fake download links are usually a sign of a reputable website please dont help fund them. Deluge is an excellent opensource client that isnt in close cooperation with the MPAA unlike uTorrent uninstall it as soon as possible OH MY GOD IM GONNA CUM. Oh and remember torrenting in itself isnt illegal and its probably not stealing! Its simply a method of transferring copyrighted files. Its what copyrighted data you transfer that matters.I am a bot and this action was performed automatically.

9422536,0,t1_d9abl3f,gt Youre at home because youre the caregiver to your parents something thats very admirable and definitely thankless in my opinion.That was true for my mother though my father is fine healthwise besides a bit of back pain. Hes pretty spry for his age hell hes got more upper body strength than I do. That said we live off our checks his retirement and social security checks and my disability check. I also have  in food stamps each month which isnt much but every little bit helps.gt Sorry to hear about your bullying I have kids in middle school that will be entering high school shortly and its terrifying for me right now mainly for my oldest.gtgt Shes on the spectrum has anxiety social issues and selfconfidence issues making her a potential easy target. She is at her happiest when she can escape on her laptop playing Wolf Quest or other animal related sims and rpgs. If there is something wrong she is very reticent to speak about it. I wouldnt worry too much if she hasnt seen too much trouble by now she hopefully wont at all. Speaking from experience things got better for me by highschool the bullying stopped as all my peers matured and had to deal with other stuff like learning to drive. Something I should point out that I cant really do due to my medications making me drowsy and my occasional blackouts.If it might help here are some anxiety home remedies I shared on rChristianity. Dont worry its all natural stuff that doesnt involve just prayer or anythingThough I would recommend changing the prayer part of the list to meditation as self reflection can be a great way to achieve peace of mind and boost selfconfidence.A lot of this I wish Id known years ago for sure.gt I cant really relate too much to your current situation as Im not really religious or anythingI wouldnt call myself religous per se rather spiritual with Christian values. I dont go to church or read the bible every wednesday but like Ghandi said I like your Christ. I do not like your Christians they are so unlike your Christ. I realize my experiences during prayer are mine alone and irreplicable I dont claim absolute certainty or anything. Hell I couldnt tell you if what I experienced was God my dead ancestors or the collective inteligence of the universe itself. But whatever it was it did right by me so theres that.gt all I can say is that you seem normal enough to merj scoff How can any normal person still believe in magic sky wizards?

The police have left theres now little authority or accountability. The fumes are intoxicating. People want the parade to end so they begin breaking into storefronts stealing merchandise. Theyre bitter bitter about the long line of exceedingly boring parade vehicles. Pitchforks materialize from the bones of old beaten dead horses. The music from the parade turns dissonant and deep. Few are actually having fun. The piles of rank manure grow the gases from the unending line of vehicles suffocate. Its pitch black when all of the sudden a flood of lights appear blinding you.

You start in the first year of high school in Australia year  and try and make it to Year .Various challenges including dealing with your parents divorce friendships relationships and balancing your work and your life. Would have a Life is Strange aesthetic with a folk rock  folk synth soundtrack.Gameplay is mostly about choices with you making the movements opening lockers choosing who to talk to what to write etc.Some randomly generated school life issues such as rumours spouts of depression and general issues.You can play as either a boy a girl a boy who wishes to be a girl a girl who wishes to be a boy etc. Choose a sexuaality and that will impact your life.Is this too weird? ,Gamingcirclejerk,dc74q3y,4,t5_2sf2b

10303025,0,t1_dcbrjt4,gtThey do not consider all complexities of Skyrim or Fallout  worthy.What would those complexities be exactly? They are big games with a lot of things to do though in the latter New Vegas is bigger but complex is not the word I would use to describe them. Being able to do many things definitely makes it a complex videogame when compared to Pokmon for example but their gameplay and roleplaying complexity pales in comparison to many other RPGs.I loved Skyrim I must have played  hours of it but that was beforer I cared less about exploration and doing lots of quests and more about roleplaying.gtThey also like a good book like Planescape Torment which doesnt have many choices but is well written.Ive played Planescape Torment this year and the game has a surprising amount of choice in how you can tackle quests what you choose to say and how what you say influences the NPCs you talk to. To say it doesnt have many choices would be a lie. Its also silly to compare Morrowind to a game from  which is why it is usually compared to Gothic a game that truly nailed faction progression and relationships and if Im not mistaken came either one year earlier or months later. For example Morrowinds NPCs as you say are static they cant enter or leave buildings whereas in Skyrim they can move. That alone gives you a higher degree of freedom on how to make a game.gtMorrowind way of doing static factions when they just give you quest and require specific character build.Like any great roleplaying game really. Remember cRPGs have their roots in tabletop roleplaying games. My warrior shouldnt be able to become Archmage of the College of Winterhold. Its also not a matter of well just dont join them! its a matter of how little did the game actually take my build into account. A complex RPG should care about those things but Skyrim just doesnt.gthere are different playstyles but they prefer classic RPG idea of freedom of progression when your character is defined by how close he is to objectively best build. This is also not true. Otherwise you would be negating that which you just saidgtwhere theres a main story with varied outcomes and you influence it all and you can replay it several times to get a different experienceOther than that its true the Codex really prefers RPGs that take your build and your decisions into account and its why Skyrim is generally seen as a mediocre hiking simulator. Its good for imaginary roleplaying but then you actually do the games quests and find they are all related to fetching stuff or killing Draugr...EDIT I just noticed another user recognized the issue with the College and no wonder he says just dont do it.,Gamingcirclejerk,dcbwizf,1,t5_2sf2b

You can argue all day that the games an FPS primarily for entertainment and youd be right.That doesnt mean that theres no creative direction behind the game. You dont have to think cor thats sad for it to have a message. The reaction of people to the inclusion of black soldiers and to the fact that most maps arent in France reveals that the game is challenging the public perception of the war. Why do you think the covers got a black soldier on it and why do you think the marketing showed people like the Harlem Hellfighters and soldiers of the Arab Revolt? The game is first and foremost a shooter yes. Having fun killing polygon soldiers is the main draw of it. That doesnt mean the game cant still challenge our idea of what World War One is. gtAm I supposed to feel remorse and I think of my great uncle Albert who lies in a grave in Northern France while Im blasting the face off a polygon man whether they have white skin textures or black skin textures? I dont think theres anything this game can teach me that I havent already learned from decade old Call of Duty games or Band of Brothers or The Pacific.A game doesnt have to make you feel sad to have a message and a message isnt necessarily a lesson that youre bludgeoned with. The simple portrayal of WW as extending beyond the usual perception is a message in itself.And I think the fact that CoD Band of Brothers and The Pacific  not to mention the vast majority of WW media  has focused on European and American soldiers proves that games like BF are needed to challenge the usual perception.So long as our popular culture focuses on one particular view of history the public perception wont change. The average player of BF has probably heard of Verdun but maybe not the Arab Revolt. Games like BF widen that view of history for the average person and expose them to the ignored untold and forgotten. ,Gamingcirclejerk,dcvx64q,7,t5_2sf2b

10499522,0,t1_dcy4qjr,You are the densest most straw man dependent person I have had the misfortune to encounter on redditCoD has since advanced warfare turned its back on boots on the ground gameplay. Infinite warfare was the tipping point for people getting sick of that change in gameplayThat change in gameplay is a result of the missing the actual stereotypical problem criticism of CoD that being CoD is the same every year.  The actual issue was that Activision put all their eggs in one basket and forced CoD to be pumped out every year. When you do that the formula gets stale because there is no time period to want a new game. This cooldowngrace period as it is sometimes called is how franchise like Zelda Pokemon and Mario can last decades. They leave their fanbase wanting more and giving them the time to WANT more.Activision use the burn brighthalf as long style franchise handling ie release as much of as possible as fast as possible for quick profit so as result their franchise die much faster. But Activision seem to like to forget that the downside to that strategy is they need a new game to take the place of that candle the candle before CoD being GuitarDJ Hero the next one is set to be Destiny and they then have to prolong a franchises death until the next candle gets going. CoD straying from boots on the ground is a direct result of this scenario and because it doesnt play like the original CoD anymore people have rejected it. The upside or downside depending on your view of CoD to this is if they release a boots on the ground CoD soon they could actually keep the franchise alive by reigniting interest in the old play style.My point IS that this is a similar situation to Halo right now,Gamingcirclejerk,dcy8cig,-3,t5_2sf2b

10535799,0,t1_dd2ahud,gtBut chances are Id have skipped it and gotten something else if it launched at  when everything else around it was  just because the developer says its worth .Hmm I understand what you mean. I assumed developers being able to freely price their games would have actually benefited some of the lesser less content games.For example between CoD and Fallout  I would certainly buy Fallout . Its the same price but the latter offers just much more content so its really a nobrainer for me. On the other hand if Fallout  was actually around  then now I would have to make a decision.The problem is of course that what I suggest means that a games price depends on what the developer thinks of the game. In these examples its much easier to make a choice since all of us know what to expect from Call of Duty or Bethesda games but if it was a much more obscure title then the dev would have almost no choice but to give it a fairly reasonable price lest people refuse to buy the game.,Gamingcirclejerk,dd2ckx2,1,t5_2sf2b

10787783,0,t1_ddsokkx,It seems you are possibly discussing stealing or stealingrelated topics. Although this is against every countries rules and even a pesky commandment or two to those nonatheist filth its important to remember to be responsible. Content creators can only create said content because they receive funding from things you shit on.Stealing is an important freedom in our fascist dictatorships and its important to remember these things before you pass rightful judgement on thieves discussing itgt Some steal games because they believe the creator doesnt deserve financial compensation for the state of the product that was released. Those people are dicks.gt Some steal something that they already bought simply to remove the DRM. Which is just another word for stealing.gt Some steal to emulate NES games they definitely had  years ago. I signed that waiver Bill Clinton.gt Some steal to try products before they make a financial commitment to them. Just like WinZIP.gt Some steal simply because they cannot afford it. They are like Aladdin. But instead of stealing life sustaining nourishment its No Mans Sky.gt Some steal to get something thats no longer available. Nobody actually does but well leave this here because its the one of two somewhat legitimate reasons.gt Some steal because their country censors or doesnt import it. Despite the irony that pirating was stealing things from other countries this is a somewhat valid reason to do so. Please move to a new fascist dictatorship.gt Some steal games because of timed exclusivity. If they dont have access to it yet they use piracy as a method to access it before its available to them. Just like when Greg who works at Gamestop slips me a copy on Monday. Ill totally pay him er uh Gamestop later.Lastly heres a few tips AdBlock is awesome for hiding fake download links. Fake download links are usually a sign of a reputable website please dont help fund them. Deluge is an excellent opensource client that isnt in close cooperation with the MPAA unlike uTorrent uninstall it as soon as possible OH MY GOD IM GONNA CUM. Oh and remember torrenting in itself isnt illegal and its probably not stealing! Its simply a method of transferring copyrighted files.

Ive rarely heard anyone mention the Sogdians an Iranianspeaking peoples from Central Asia when talking about the Silk Road even though they played a critical role in not just the economies but the politics and cultural diffusion across much of the Iranian plateau Central Asia and China. Or actually it just misses out a lot on the Silk Road in general and just portrays it as a happy la la land of multicultural magical trade. Another example is the USA vs USSR who contributed more to WWII fights you see a lot. Matter is both countries were crucial to the war effort but people just turn it into an avenue for their own political biases depending on which one they support and it also misses out on the contributions of other countries  few people talk about how China was very critical in tying up Japanese forces in Asia for instance. I guess as we seem to agree on in trying to appeal to a general audience you end up going to things they would be more receptible to or think the audience is receptible to but the cost is that you often  lose a lot of academic clout because not a lot of people are good at being both academically solid for their respective field and able to talk to laymen. I suppose thats just what happens with pop history whether theyre Eurocentric or not it always ends up unsatisfactory in the end for me as someone with more of an academic background in history. In general these days I only go to academic books for my history but unfortunately not everyone has a decent academic background in history like me.,Gamingcirclejerk,dedj6oa,1,t5_2sf2b

BotW shares a lot of familiar mechanics but makes it much easier more friendly to use. Openworld games have always been hard for me to get into. Contrary to popular opinion Bethesda games have always been my favorite openworld games and its because even though I can craft gather hunt quest and more I dont have to. Im not required to gather to make potions cook food and build new weapons. Straight from the start I have this sense of adventure and curiosity and every single place I see can be explored. I love that feeling. And really Breath of the Wild is the only openworld game besides Bethesda ones that really ever give me that feeling.

Ive determined that in the early s internet forums and gaming communities actually looked like wholesomely enjoyable places to be.Heres an example from the Through the Looking Glass forumsAn entire thread dedicating to praising the work of  Emil Pagliarulo practically calling him a prodigy of game and level design. Where Looking Glass employees joined in to call him an infectiously happy and inspiring coworker. Emil and his wife even join in to thank everybody.This kind of grounded praise is way to rare in more recent years probably a product of way more people talking about games on the internet.

11320794,0,t1_dff6d9s,Oh yeah MEs gameplay still holds up pretty well. What doesnt hold up is some questionable decision making ending aside I found it serviceable with the extended cut. Weird sexy space robots with swords Cerberus magically going from a shady black ops group to having a comically evil stupidly massive military force in less than sixth months along with a cool new bad dude completely devoid of personality. I thought the last encounter with the Illusive Man was really well done and I dont know why they didnt find a way to make him more prominent in the story. Cerberus just seemed like filler in parts of the game simply for the sake of gameplay variety which isnt entirely bad but the way theyre involved in some missions feels really contrived. Also EDIs BODY GOD WHY WAS THAT NECESSARY?tldr CerberusI havent played ME in quite a few years so I probably wont notice its flaws much more now. Playing Leviathan for the first time made me realize how pointless MEs big reveal was if it could just be introduced in the next game in a much more interesting way xfiles in spaaaaaaace. But the actual suicide mission and being able to pull it off with everyone alive without resorting to any guides whatsoever was a very unique experience.

11599363,0,t1_dgamami,I also havent played the game......but totally agree with most of what youre saying. We should have all types of characters evil gay good gay morally grey gay and rapey gay etc...But when the only two gay characters in the game are portrayed as incredibly sexually aggressive towards what Im gathering is an underage man then yeah things become weird. Im not gonna make a jump and assume the developers feel a certain way about homosexuals but currently in this moment I dont feel good about viewing the only homosexual representation in the game act super rapey towards a minor. What I think youre saying is not everything is meant as a political statement social commentary or an attack but you cant deny that these people feel attacked. You cant deny that these people are inferring this as a political statement a very ugly one at that. Asking them to step outside of it and not view it as an umbrella attack or a broad statement about a minority is silly. Its counterproductive when the end goal is always being more empathetic towards each other. But they didnt mean it... doesnt hold strong when the offense has already taken place. So to me it doesnt really matter what the intent was here the damage has been done. Peoples feelings are hurt and lines have been drawn. I feel the intent isnt important when what youre dealing with is inherently problematic. ,Gamingcirclejerk,dgasok3,10,t5_2sf2b

11709542,0,t1_dgn3yia,Ive always thought of the series as PS exclusive out of coincidence rather than an intentional choice. Persona    and  came out on consoles PS and  which were absolute behemoths. I also think might be wrong though that porting at the time was far harder because you had to code radically different architectures. Not only that but a game such as P Golden could never have run on a DS and the same goes for PP on a DS. And it didnt make sense to make Persona  for XBOX  and XBOX One because those consoles dont even exist in Japan. We know that Sony doesnt own Persona otherwise PQ could never have come out on the DS and Persona  Arena could have never come out on XBOX One. So the big question is has Atlus signed an exlusivity contract with Sony? And if so does it apply to possible expanded versions of the game as well? Atlus is property of SEGA now. I think that if SEGA feels like an opportunity is there and that there is nothing stopping them theyll go for it. ,Gamingcirclejerk,dgnb1bb,3,t5_2sf2b

Some people see the difference very much some dont see it so clearly.But I am currently playing Witcher  at FPS on my PS as we speak and the game looks and feels good. Completely smooth. Like I dont know whats the big deal about Muh FPS are cancer.,Gamingcirclejerk,dguw5zy,2,t5_2sf2b
11776702,0,t3_680cfx,Not to mention that the textures are pretty photorealistic anyway. Theres a ceiling to texture quality.,Gamingcirclejerk,dguxd3o,3,t5_2sf2b
11779808,0,t1_dgv8ytg,Oh that sounds super interesting I might have to do something similar when I make my next character or if I go back to one of the ones I abandoned early on like my Altmer. When I made her I was going to make her a strict Archer but I just found archery to be so... Boring for lack of a better word. Im not sure why but it just wasnt fun which is weird because I played through as an Archer once before years ago. Ah well kinda bummed i wasted a cool character design and name but I could always come back to her later.,Gamingcirclejerk,dgva1on,2,t5_2sf2b

11784211,0,t1_dgvr2kx,Correct. The only issue with them is that finding the maps can be hard and you can find stuff out of order and the teirs can be confusing. I got the basic level legendary Griffin armour then I found the diagrams for the Surperior Griffin armor and took it to a Smith only to find out that I needed the Enchanced Griffin armor first which I dont even have the map for. Its kinda weird how the game gives you the maps for the upgrades in random order so you can get the scavenger hunt for the highest upgrades before you even know where to find the basic level armor set. ,Gamingcirclejerk,dgvs1oq,1,t5_2sf2b

11809961,0,t3_68htta,Thats the least diverse faces Ive seen since first Pong.Three white women and one has a stupid side cut that you can find on rd of soccer moms walking from grocery store. They all even have been modelled after conventionally attractive models. Im scared of what they would do if Bioware was actually inclusive.,Gamingcirclejerk,dgyp7nu,12,t5_2sf2b
