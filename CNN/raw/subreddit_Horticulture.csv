7075352,0,t3_4ci1ht,Hey everyone thanks for looking. I noticed these odd beadlike spots in my snake plant a couple days ago. It looks bigrelated to me. I did use lava rocks instead of pond stones for drainage and I had just started a new bag of potting soil. But I havent seen these in any of my other plants I have about  at least  of which were repotted along with this one. Any ideas? Thank you for the help!!!!,Horticulture,d1ics6i,1,t5_2qor7

11103295,0,t3_5yidx3,I worked at a retail nursery one summer while going for my hort degree. Helped immensely once woody planttree ID class came around. I still stop by on occasion  years later to catch up with the yard guys. Lots of heavy lifting long hours in the sun a good knife and being able to tie knots helps as People try to fit a  caliper maple in their CRV. Learned a bunch of Spanish too. Pay wasnt that great but I didnt plan on making a career there soooooo.. ,Horticulture,deqjrt9,6,t5_2qor7
