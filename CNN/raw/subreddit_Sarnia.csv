8389467,0,t3_4ueo4u,The goodwill on Michigan has a large selection and they have  off days periodically I am not sure how often. VarageSale Sarnia has some pretty good listings too. Value Village is crappy and overpriced and most of the books you can probably get better new. The Rotary club has a HUGE booksale a couple times a year at Bayside mall there are some great finds especially old and classics. About once per year the library also has a huge book sale. Its like . to fill up a shopping bag. ,Sarnia,d5q8br3,2,t5_2rrc2

Replaced it with a molestation accusation now from a different account. So transparent. Complains about harassment from multiple fake social media accounts as she creates multiple accounts to push her agenda. Hypocrite. ,Sarnia,ddnj8j8,2,t5_2rrc2
