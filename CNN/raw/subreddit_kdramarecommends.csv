3241323,0,t3_2x2ina,Honestly I dont like any high school genre at all. All the actors are in their late ss and are dressed up as high schoolers... Its just not right and I kinda feel kdrama writers should just abolish this genre alltogether. Dunno I guess Im too old to watch high school kdramas.I guess my favorite highschool kdrama is Reply  but then again that really wasnt the best part kdrama. s It was the second half that really set the show apart though where they had careers and stuff.... I do admit though that the highschoolness made that last half better though.,kdramarecommends,coxyy0a,2,t5_31t53

Partially started ExGirlfriend club mostly because of her since I was curious what she was up to after leaving the group.  Really liked her rap sequences while she was in the group.

He posts his experiences on an online forum and asks for advice on how to go about dating her.

6440386,0,t3_43v7c6,Late Night Restaurant is different from most dramas but is quaint and charming. It doesnt really have an overarching plot but is a series of vignettes focusing on different characters each episode. Almost the entire series takes place in the tiny restaurant so it does have a low budget feeling but it has heart. Plus every episode is named after a food that has special meaning to the character being focused on. Has a very slight Lets Eat vibe as far as the food porn goes.Its not going to appeal to everyone but I found it refreshingly different. Im hoping for a season .,kdramarecommends,czlh3os,2,t5_31t53

8717392,0,t3_4zd4wj,I am also watching Sukina Hito ga Iru Koto right now I love both reverse harem and cohabitation dramas.If Cinderella and the Four Knights isnt based on the weird Jdorama Atashinchi no Danshi they have to be coming from the same source material. The romance is less overt since she is the guys widowed stepmom in the Japanese version. And the house is crazy.Click Your Heart is a web drama. It is short and sweet and shows who she would end up with depending on what choices were made. Every ship gets to sail here!Every version of Youre Beautiful has its own charms though the Kdrama is my favorite followed by the Taiwanese Fabulous Boys. She was going to be a nun ends up posing as her twin brother and joining a boy band. All the boys be loving her.  The whole thing is hilarious and selfaware.Flower Boy Ramen Shop  takes place at her deceased fathers ramen shop. Main contenders for her heart are the narcoleptic new ramen chef and the  year old high school student she mistook for an oppa before she then discovered she was his new teacher. Ooops.  Hes totally rich and hilariously spoiled.Sungkyunkwan Scandal is another gender bender this time set in the past. It is a fusion drama though so it is comic and has a modern sensibility. She reluctantly lives as a male scholar at Sungkyunkwan University with two roommates and a neighbor who suspects she is a girl and is regularly trying to expose her.  They all become friends and all three guys have crusheslove for her to varying degrees. A very cute and funny drama with great action too.,kdramarecommends,d6vbaaa,2,t5_31t53
9110608,0,t3_54sl74,I guess you are asking for a Drama with Action elements?If soBring it on Ghost aka Lets fight Ghost.Cute with a lot of Action.

Wait for me Healerya.Iris  Athena  Goddes of WarExplosions and eye candy.Anything Lee Jun KiWhile being very very pretty Lee Jun Ki has a great grasp on Action and I could watch him become the hero of People again and again.

9784243,0,t3_5f9xuc,Im going to second a lot of the ones already mentioned. School  Misaeng and Signal are prettymuch cheesefree.ampnbspThe Reply series to be honest has a few cheesy moments but I think that as a whole theyre very real and not cringey. ampnbspHealer Kill Me Heal Me Its Okay Thats Love I Hear Your Voice and the Producers are all ones that I would say walk the line of being cheesy at times. I personally didnt find them as cheesy as say Descendants of the Sun or Heirs but they each have moments that some may find cringeworthy. I consider all of these to be very good though and I think that overall they avoid a lot of cliches. If you can look past a few cheesy moments sprinkled throughout youll probably enjoy the overall stories.ampnbspAnother thing you may want to look into are the historical dramas. Many may come with their own variety of cringe or cheesiness but I think they can be a good change of pace from the stereotypical kdrama format. I will admit that they can be a tad overdramatic at times but they still might be something youd enjoy. Sungkyunkwan Scandal and Gu Family Book might work. I wouldnt say that theyre super realistic or free of all cheesiness but personally I find that the cheesiness is more limited and more palatable in the historical dramas than in the modern dramas.,kdramarecommends,daj4dfr,1,t5_31t53
