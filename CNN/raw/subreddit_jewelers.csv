225604,0,t1_cf3rcud,I agree that one of the problems was the economy a few years ago and thats what drove him from the industry  years ago as well. Definitely seems a fest or famine type of job when the economy is down fewer people are spending on jewelry so fewer places are hiring at all. Hes content for now with our home studio finding its easier to take it up as part time work than something we need to rely on for the bills but Im always in awe of people who can do that. ,jewelers,cf44pku,1,t5_2s8y8
380144,0,t3_1ydf86,I had a very unstructured apprenticeship if you could even call it one. I did get into it after graduating from a threeyear jewelry program so I already had intermediate skills. This is what I got out of it so maybe you can gain something from it?My boss never hovered over my shoulder to check my work but would always critique it if asked. He was willing to trust what I already knew how to do so I was never afraid to ask him for help or have him do a quality check. The problem with that is that unless I asked him directly to show me something new I was never pushed to expand my skill set or to reach that extra level of perfection.I was paid  of all custom work but was also paid  hours biweekly to work some shop hours where I assisted customers cleaned and did some light bookkeeping and inventory management. This allowed me to make a small but decent living. It worked when I was young and had a lower set of living standards.The store allowed me to use the bench for personal work at the time I had work on commission in a few other stores but it was rare I got time for it and most of what I made ended up being sold through my workplace storefront anyway.I was never asked to sign a noncompetition agreement. I was treated so well in general Sick? Take a day off! Late? Thats okay just dont let it happen three times in a row. Forgot your lunch? Take five bucks out of the till and go get something! Customer treated you like shit? Want some chocolate? that Im still very loyal to them even though I work on my own in the same city now.,jewelers,cfk6186,3,t5_2s8y8
386017,0,t1_cfkp55b,Now that is a very nice idea thanks. Easy to do and means I can keep the nicelooking small contact points on the front. Presumably adds a bit of stability when soldering too  when I was making this I had a couple of petals blown out of place by the torch Im using a plumbers torch at the moment which is probably a little too powerful...I was going to remake this rather smaller  about half the size roughly xmm petals  and using .mm fine silver at that scale I think it will definitely benefit from some more reinforcing.Thanks very much thats a really great tip.,jewelers,cfkryjv,1,t5_2s8y8

1790915,0,t1_ck2udts,I have to disagree that custom means relatively expensive. It doesnt mean cheap but it can be competitive with a lot of other jewelry and typically quality for quality can be much more cost effective. Custom isnt necessarily for if you cant find what you want its for making what you want specifically for the person you want to give it to. Personalizing it and making it special.,jewelers,ck4w9ei,2,t5_2s8y8

I also have a drawer full of wooden blocks and dowels that I use with Jett Sett This stuff can be extremely versatile once you figure out how to use it correctly. A hot glue gun works too but a little harder to clean up after. I would also invest in a small gravers vise Theyre expensive but worth it if you do a lot of setting especially pave and the like. Try Ebay you can find a decent deal there once in a while. I even found one on Craigslist once for . ,jewelers,crr6ipf,3,t5_2s8y8
4249590,0,t3_39kopw,Having a GG or GD will help you land any retail job more quickly than someone without it. Now if selling retail is not your thing you are probably going to need to search for a job in NYC or LA in the diamond districts. After GIA I went to work at a company that did wholesale jewelry and watches in Beverly Hills and am now running a pawn shop for the same owners. Most of my friends I went to school with ended up at either luxury stores BVLGARI VCA ect. working for family businesses theirs or someone elses or  working for wholesale distributors downtown. By no means are the jobs available lumped into these categories they just seem to be the most common. Just do not go into it thinking that once you are done youll be doing sothebys magnificent jewels right after. ALSO GIA does a west coast and east coast career fair.

5373869,0,t3_3ol5tw,Its not bad per se but it does SIGNIFICANTLY  or more reduce the value of the diamond. So DONT pay the same price you would as for a natural stone. And bear in mind that clarity enhanced stones are MUCH more difficult to resell later if you want to upgrade the ring down the road or whatever.Honestly youre better off staying away.,jewelers,cvykm9o,2,t5_2s8y8
5732020,0,t1_cx7iws8,Some CAD software is predominantly drag and drop. And some users in the jewelry industry never really learn to use much else. This is what I like about Rhino it necessitates what I call a clean sheet of paper approach. That I ended up with Rhino was in part a happy accident it was all I could afford and I found it learnable. gtyou could get really cool effects if it was handcarvedYoure right but my argument is that if it was hand carved it would be different simply because CADCAM is just a tool like any other and every tool leaves its tell tale mark. I dont believe it took me any more or less time to complete the model than if I had hand carved it. So its advantage in this case is not its efficiency. What is an advantage in this case is the ability to maintain consistent wall thickness and achieve the kind of geometry I was looking for. And remember it is partially hand carved and that everything else assembly setting finishing is done by hand. ,jewelers,cx7m37z,2,t5_2s8y8

6146074,0,t1_cyns33l,You might also consider a lab created emerald. They are more expensive than other lab created stones the process of creating beryl crystals in the lab takes quite a bit longer but still way less than a natural emerald and since they are flawless the fracture problems that natural emeralds have wouldnt be an issue.

7245223,0,t3_4en3zj,Moissanite is doublerefractive like a cubic zirconia which means essentially its more sparkly. A trained eye knows pretty quickly that what they are looking at is not a diamond to the untrained eye youre likely to assume its a sparkly diamond. Everything else boils down to personal preference. She likes it its what she wants? Thats what I would get her theres nothing wrong with this stone in particular everything has its up and down sides but nothing youve expressed would lead me to believe she would be unhappy with this stone all that matters is that she is happy. You should get many years perhaps a lifetime of wear from it with little or no problems which is speaking purely about the stone the mounting is an entirely different subject,jewelers,d21qabe,3,t5_2s8y8

11005741,0,t1_deefv05,Thank you for the detailed response! That makes a lot of sense to me and Ill talk with my fiance about the points you brought up.    What it comes down to is that the reject diamonds are cool to us we like that they arent sparkly and can smash easy. Sounds stupid but there it is. Also faceting it makes it difficult to see into the gem but we also think thats cool! Were a fan of the geometric shapes it takes on when light reflects off it and the fact that when inspected closer it has more depth to it than your first look at it reveals.    Sorry to vent but weve been to so many jewelry stores and its been a pretty frustrating experience. If we went in trying to make this ring without the knowledge of all the downsides to both the ring design and the stone choice then it would make sense to be told those downsides... But the response weve gotten across the board has been more to the tone of You know the downsides? Oh well good then you know that its a horrible idea. What you still want it? You must not understand the downsides let me explain them again. Its so hard to get across that yes this is what we want and we understand the downsides. We know its not traditional but its what we like! ,jewelers,defgx23,1,t5_2s8y8
11343053,0,t3_61uun6,The simplest way is to buy a gold coin that is larger than your pinky.  Go to a local coin shop and ask them for their cheapest gold coins. Hammer down the edges very gently with a ballpeen hammer or a spoon until the edges mushroom out.  This will take a very long time so do it while watching movies etc but the slower you go the better it looks.  Once the edges have reached the approximate size of your pinky drill out the center.  this makes a lovely very strong ring due to the hammering ?annealing? the molecules.  look up coin ring if you need more info.  Best of luck.,jewelers,dfhprep,1,t5_2s8y8
