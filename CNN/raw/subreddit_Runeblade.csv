4149301,0,t3_387ub5,In order to unlock the new artifacts you have to be on your fifth OVERALL generation. This includes your very first run your second run after the forcedretire plus three more retires. Not sure if this applies to everyone but the new items were unlocked when I started my fifth gen.

It requires you to enter your existing Artefacts to work correctly as well as the number of Crystals you have to spend.The  and  change the Artefact levels by  and the ltlt and gtgt change the Artefact levels by .This is the current version but I have an August version ready to go when the update is released to help everyone with their upgrade planning.Hosting it on my dropbox for now but trying to incorporate it into the wiki but theyve had the javascript locked down for  weeks due to a security breach.Feedback welcome!

4933203,0,t1_cufsn8f,Right what I am interested to see is at what point would you start usinginvesting crystals in ROE instead of say leaving ROE around say  conversion for a while  crystals and instead dropping those same crystals into SRS and EW respectively. I think the priority for me personally will be to max Rozh next run which will cost  to unlock plus  for the max  and then Amulet to around  or so which will cost just over  crystals  to level to  and  to unlock. Obviously Ill also need to make sure I have enough crystals saved at this point to make sure I have at minimum  crystals to get to at least X damage modifier.Im going to try the Aoxoa method once Im done to get my Amulet to  I can usually get to  in under an hour and repeat that as many times as I can throughout the day until bed and go for it.  Youre sacrificing your current run for the long term goal. Youll obviously get stuck somewhere waiting at a Guardian while you sleep but the idea is that you can zerg out of the s pretty quick the next day right?

5649202,0,t1_cwwt119,Remember that the multipliers are based on the original amount not the current amount. So if your headband goes from  to  thats a  increase not . By the same logic increasing SRS from x to x expensive is equivalent to increasing your Rozh bonus from x to x cheap. So I try to level up all the multipliers together instead of focusing on just one. ,Runeblade,cwxc6yj,1,t5_380bi
5653419,0,t1_cwntchh,Was it worth raising up Wristband? What is your TAP damage at the end of your run compared to your DPS? I mentioned something on another thread and Aoxoa suggested to stick with DPS right now because of the building synergies from Mithrode Jewel and ROE. ,Runeblade,cwxv1fn,1,t5_380bi

6004256,0,t1_cy66l8c,Hi PirateNinjaaNot seeing Diamonds is most likely a separate issue which is not related to TBEs. Sometimes there are issues with the UI framework which stop certain elements from being drawn and when theyre not drawn you cant activate them. This issue is fixed by closing Runeblade long press social button and long press again and starting the game again.Just to be sure we did take a look at the code today and no changes have been made anything related to Diamonds so hopefully the above solves the issue for you! Let me know if the problem persists and well fix this one way or another?,Runeblade,cy6oscu,1,t5_380bi
6025455,0,t1_cy9ga14,Sounds reasonable. Post level  is season  and thats when hopefully the developers will bring on a stable version for all of us again. Sorry for all that have to deal with a broken build now D,Runeblade,cy9gj8d,1,t5_380bi
6068499,0,t3_3ynfx3,Sounds like youre doing really well. I spent almost a week getting to lv. on my first go. Even after that I was typically retiring from generation runs every week or two..I think my mistake early on was not retiring enough to build up crystals. Id instead opt for trying to go deeper and slower into higher levels but it didnt help me in the end. So try to find the right balance that works for you once youve crossed lv. for the first time.,Runeblade,cyf2j4m,1,t5_380bi
6422277,0,t1_czjkmbv,Good luck! Those last  levels are pretty slow going unless you have a super pimpedout build. But it feels like a real achievement to grab that level .Im really glad that were getting more milestone achievements now  and that corresponding rewards seem very worthwhile like the  damage that you get for reaching  the first time if I read RunebladeGMs screenshot correctly. So far there hasnt been much incentive to go deep. Before I made my run for  the highest I had been was level  or so.,Runeblade,czjllvc,1,t5_380bi

7310296,0,t3_4fgods,I suspect the basic fallacy at play here this question comes up a lot! is in not treating HoP as a kind of damage multiplier. Pulling forward the rune upgrades by  or  or whatever levels allows you to so the same damage now as youd do  or  levels from now. Thats huge. Youd slow down much sooner. Also unless youre burning Jaagu all day every day the incremental boost from an additional  to  gates on every idle adds up and lets you do your runs way quicker.My gold boost is effectively x at level . Dont think in terms of linear gates  think in terms of the massive damage boost you get at any particular level by being able to buy an upgrade thats x more expensive.Also the gold increase per kill is slower than the HP increase of the monsters. However the discrepancy isnt so huge that you can just ignore the gold increase altogether which is exactly what youre doing if you do a basic only  levels more calculation. You need to factor in the massive slowdown youll get from not being able to upgrade in the deep end.  I am virtually certain that I wouldnt get much beyond  without HoP whereas my average farming run gets me up to  these days. And thats simply because without gold to upgrade your runes you cant make progress. Think about. By this reasoning of the massive difficulty increase at least x per  levels a simple calculation would lead you to believe that a level  Samadun x damage multiplier only gains me an extra  levels. But thats not true. Because without it my overall damage would plummet and Id grind to a standstill much much much sooner than I currently do.,Runeblade,d294q3o,1,t5_380bi

9987219,0,t3_5imipm,It will eventually level things out if you consider the long view. Sell back artifacts and make instant effective use of crystals in the challenge. If you want Aoxoa levels of crystals you can do that too by grinding in the first  levels for a few more months with a level  MS earning as many as you want for as long as you want. Meanwhile the players that have done  months worth of grinding already can still tap away in the SC experimenting with other builds and earning enough to cover the sell back  loss. Over time and if competitive play is introduced things will equalize. New players will be able to catch up after  months to a year of play but they wont be able to do it over night. They will still have to earn it. ,Runeblade,db9d2cg,2,t5_380bi

10317463,0,t3_5nqb7k,Shadow Challenge mode isnt a bad thing... but I agree with you. Part of the fun I had in Runeblade was that it was easy and somewhat automatic to play. I didnt have to play it as aggressively as SW GOH on my phone checking in multiple times for energy etc. Unfortunately I dont have a save game to revert back preSC through some weird coincidences. I thought I had saved one but I guess I overwrote it. SC requires me to play several times every hour to keep progress moving forward thanks to Baloys Gift it kind of gets easier as time goes on but the pre grind in SC is fairy slow even starting around  with Orb.I hope that uRunebladeGM could somehow work a patch in the future that lets you toggle between SC and Standard mode. SC is just not that fun for me and now Im stuck here again had a save game to revert but I guess got pushed down. I really dont know how much longer I will continue with the game in this mode. I may have to pause it until they come up with something else content to push towards etc.,Runeblade,dcdjgpm,1,t5_380bi
