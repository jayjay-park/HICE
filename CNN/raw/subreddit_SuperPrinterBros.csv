I was able to get mine since it was delivered to a sorority right across from my fraternity so definitely call USPS. Like they also said it was delivered to my address but they looked further in to it and it was delivered to a similar address by mistake across the street.,SuperPrinterBros,dfsc6n1,2,t5_3jb32
