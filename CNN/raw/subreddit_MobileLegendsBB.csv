9665867,0,t3_5dft4u,This is AWESOME. Of course you are not supposed to chat when you are in the action but its going to be awesome to use it when you die and waiting to respawn! Just allow players to block comunications from the score screen maybe and put a little cooldown in place so you cant spam dont make it too long either though.,MobileLegendsBB,da4ir4m,1,t5_3gvux

9953341,0,t3_5hxj1m,Fanny is nerfed again in recent patch. Now her energy regeneration is  worse and it wasnt really prominent before. You need a lot of time to fully regen and fountain doesnt help.No I agree she is still strong in a good hands. Dont make the false assumption I dont know what Im talking about its me in this video.But I strongly disagree that Fanny needs a nerf.Fanny is godlike in teamfights only if she is in blue buff. Else she relies on killing opponent to regain energy and thats not very consistent.  wirlwinds that she can do with her full energy meter DO damage and contribute to victory but so much as any mage or assasin can do. Its not even on AlukardYunMarksman level. And she can be countered with CC spells her health is too low to live past say second stun effect and sometimes even Yun grab.You dont need to nerf Fanny to nerf her. You need to slightly nerf blue buff or rework it so it doesnt affect Fanny that huge.,MobileLegendsBB,db4y1yr,1,t5_3gvux
10058008,0,t1_dbhvxxc,Thats what I thought but after some testing Im pretty sure it is extremely buggy and Franco is almost playing  skill. He has  base movement speed after attacking a jungle creep and retreating your movement updates to  so thats working fine after about  seconds problem is his HP Regen stays the same! So atm you get  movement speed out of combat as a passive and thats it which is pretty much the worste passive in the game...,MobileLegendsBB,dbikzpq,1,t5_3gvux

10467587,0,t1_dctei6y,Its not that easy finding the percent attack speed you need. Im guessing you want to max it out? Each hero has a different base attack speed but with each level it goes up not only that but red buff gives you attack speed so you want to take into account for that too along with any passives that might help.,MobileLegendsBB,dculw64,1,t5_3gvux

10676871,0,t3_5smh4g,Im hoping there is because tbh its really easy to get legend compared to other mobas with elo systems for ranks.Ive been diamond my whole life in league and I know its going to take more to at least get to d or master.With mobile legends I got the game octnov. then reached legend last month as well. Keeping it there for the rank rewards and thats about it.The climb from unranked to legend is like halfway the climb to glorious legend imho.,MobileLegendsBB,ddh8lpt,1,t5_3gvux
