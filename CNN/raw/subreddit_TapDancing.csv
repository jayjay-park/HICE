10781896,0,t1_ddqwqty,Ive grown used to them so they feel easier to dance in than my capezios which feel too light and slipperlike. They have weight and momentum which helps my feet to swing through shuffles and flaps with less actual effort. Granted my styles pretty loose and less crisp than formal tap technique I practice Drunken Monkey style tap so my sound is a bit slurred  but the heel has a good chunky bass tone and the toe tone while not exactly bright on the beat up plyboard I dance on have an audibly different crisper tone.I weigh  and my right ankle requires gentler consideration so I cant do toestands in any brand of shoes. Heel stands arent an issue though.,TapDancing,dds2og6,1,t5_2vho0
