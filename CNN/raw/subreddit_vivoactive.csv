4238122,0,t1_cs3bt5f,gt boring and pointless support questionsHow dare you call my boring post boring.  Totally kidding.  I agree.  When i first got mine it was pretty close to when they came out so i was surprised to see that this sub was already created by someone yet nothing was posted.  So i figure id try to get some activity going and seeing as how there isnt anything really here dont see the harm in posting support questions in case there are reddit users who also are having issues.  ,vivoactive,cs3c66q,1,t5_361hf
9868177,0,t1_datrzn8,Thanks for letting me know.  Im not so worried about inaccuracy when strength training.  I got it more for triathlon training  racing so I could monitor what heart rate zone Im in while Im cycling or running and for the swim data.,vivoactive,datuh4l,1,t5_361hf
