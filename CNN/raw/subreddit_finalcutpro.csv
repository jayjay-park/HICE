9901230,0,t3_5h7e7s,Im no pro but have been playing around with pro editing software since middle school on avid media suite pro then premiere and then was out of the game for a while.  Never really liked iMovie because I think I was trying to look at it like the old pro software.  Needed to start editing again for fun when video from the cell phones became such good quality.  Jumped in to FCPX and I love it.  I never understood the hate for it except for the face that I know some people just dont like change especially on something like this that they work with everyday and dont want stuff moving around on them.  ,finalcutpro,day5iyu,2,t5_2shoi
