Like when your parents tell you not to touch the hot stove and you did it anyway. He gave us free will but still wants so much to help us. Too bad we suck at taking good advice.I do believe that hell and heaven are literal places sort of. As in God lives in Heaven and Hell is where he tossed those who rebelled against him. I dont really feel that hell is where bad people end up though i believe hell is something you go through and dying without learning and repenting means you will continue to be in a hell of your own making until the end. Big emphasis on the learning thing though i cant stand the way people do things and think that saying the religious equivalent of sorry my bad is enough. If you dont learn from your mistakes and change then you arent sorry!Dont take my views as the normal SDA view. Im a bit of an oddity.,BlackFaith,cilgpsv,2,t5_32buv
