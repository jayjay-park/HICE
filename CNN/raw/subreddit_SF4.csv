109849,0,t1_ceqpflb,The tried to dp message after the tatsu Your safest option after a tatsu that puts the opponent at disadvantage but isnt punishable is to block and then do a delayed tech after a few frames. This allows you to punish them if they dp and tech a throw if they throw you.If the opponent teleports dont bother trying to work out which side of you theyre gunna land on just throw some crouch jabs until they hit and then confirm once they start hitting. Its good to see you have your antiair dps together in this match! After a divekick why the st.mp starter? cr.lp to st.hp is much better since if you see them blocking you can stop the blockstring after a couple jabs and go for a tick throwframetrap. Also you drop Evil Ryus punish way too much to be using it in matches. Just use st.hp xx tatsu gt dp for now which can FADC to ultra if you have meter.Just crouch block if Akuma players go for a random teleport U gimmick. It wont even chip you in most cases.

118839,0,t1_cervopf,Ah yes zoning  This is something i still struggle with.  Guile is a annoying zoner because he recovers so fast from his sonic booms to your window to punish him is small. Patients is key The trick is to vary the way you deal with the fireballs and not just jumping in all the time and eating something like a flash kick. Walk forward a bit and block  neutral jump over them FBA and even focus dash forward through some to get closer and gain meter. If you mix up how you deal with fireballs theyre not gonna know when your about to strike. So your opponent may throw a sonic boom thinking youre just gonna sit there but really you jumped in and you can punish him. You have to make it a guessing game as to what your gonna do. Also stick close to them where you can get in with one jump that way they have no breathing space and one bad guess will screw them up. Watch my fav Honda HERE and see how he mixes up how he deals with fireballs and at the same time stays in his face. Makes the Ken think before doing anything.More often than not theyll crack and will stop zoning and thats when you can have fun  If they keep zoning you despite all that theyll typically have a pattern like throwing back to back fireballs or something. If they have a habit of throwing back to back fireballs after you see the first one its a good guess that another one is coming and you can jump in at that moment.Oh and remember that Vegas backflip one of his Ultras and Ex Sky High Claw goes through fireballs too so thats another few ways to mix up your approach P,SF4,ceryp1p,2,t5_2r4cj

159402,0,t3_1vvmdr,Probably not the best suggestion but I find Abels TT throw invincibility from the very first frame mind you has saved me multiple times especially against online giefs.if you stepkick half the time theyll instinctively try to mash ex spd and just end up wasting meter.if they try greenhands spd you can easily grab them out of that too which is just hilarious.By far the most satisfying is when they telegraph an Ultra input and you grab them out of Ultra.In most cases after TT you can follow up with forward dash j.mk to beat out his lariat on wakeup again online giefs love to mash this out  of time. Abels an easy character to scrub out online giefs free.That being said a good gief with solid footsies is going to know not to do dumb shit and so you cant rely on TT throw invincibility as much. The matchup becomes much harder because his spd outranges yours you still have the throw invincibility but thats a dangerous gamble if youre out of its immediate range.Realistically though the best characters are going to be good fireballs zoners like Sagat.,SF4,cewl7qb,2,t5_2r4cj

203030,0,t1_cf1d6u7,Its a nice principal but the problem is this is a normal match between these two characters as cold hearted as that sounds. The Makoto player gets momentum and Seths health bar drains.  Its pretty typical if youve ever watched these matches enough. It also doesnt help when you look at the last minute of this video from an analytical point of view and realize it was mistake after mistake after mistake by both players.  It was a sloppy mess of a game during the comeback. Not all comebacks are note worthy.  I dont mean to be a dick about it but thats the sad truth.   What makes a comeback impressive is when the situation is actually pretty messed up.  Why was Justin Wongs come back with Cyclops in Marvel  impressive?  Because in Marvel  Cyclops is an assist character who sucks out on the field and typically if you got down to your anchor when your opponent still had all  characters you were finished.   It was not normal to run it all the way back. Now lets say look at Marvel  come backs are common in that game.  Hell they are way too common in that game.   You pop XFactor get  successful hits and  BAM! gt Comeback.   Even without XFactor a lot of characters are good at making comebacks. So no I really cant.  Sorry to say. ,SF4,cf1kh9o,0,t5_2r4cj

239672,0,t1_cf5gwuk,I think you could benefit more from positioning yourself at your st.mk range. Like you said it sucks playing footsies against Ibuki who can vortex off of a seemingly random neckbreaker. From the video in your neutral game you were always crouch blocking at her ideal range jump in distance. Walk forward and st.mk or walk forward and crouch block You anti aired well with cr.hp when you could but I think you might see better success by avoiding the whole situation. Walk forward in the neutral game until your opponent lets you know they are going to neck breaker but in a long set you might lose that round but then you can bait a neck breaker by walking forward and crouch blocking. Your offensive pressure was good and you basically always want to keep pushing her into a corner which you did well in the matches that you won. Anyway hope that helps.,SF4,cf5ldd2,1,t5_2r4cj

When you consider a characters kit too Id give it to Akuma sweep. Its literally what makes his vortex work. He can go for knockdown setups off sweeps at footsie range. Its fast and difficult to punish at footsie spacing. Can sweep off his tatsu for more setups. He can use it to go for counter demons both as an anti air sweep lowers hitbox and to beat focuses can cancel when he sees the focus. It allows him to combo into a hard knockdown from a  or more opportunity.Other than the select few who play him solely as runaway Akuma its what makes the character work.,SF4,cg3ufrb,3,t5_2r4cj

WE used to record matches on the VCR as well I wish we still had those tapes. eventually we got a proper Gamepro strategy guide for Turbo and I think at the back of it it had an interview with John Choi or someone like that... i think whoever it was played guile tho so it might not have been him. ,SF4,cg9an3n,2,t5_2r4cj

Ken has an option select i can confirm it works on Honda dont know much about Ken though. dont see why it wouldnt work on full cast where he does a safe jump on hard knockdown if I press any button I eat ultra if I just block he just gets a free tick. it would be wise to learn about how powerful kens option selects are once you get your execution down.,SF4,cgh9hmb,2,t5_2r4cj

954451,0,t3_250a02,As a Rufus player I would recommend you to avoid playing Rufus first... Hes a very mind game oriented and reaction based character. And the new USF will make his game almost obsolete since he does not have good footsies.OK time for tips. for shoryu heavy opponents just learn to predict them and instead of avoiding them provoke them ! One problem we have as Rufus player is that we abuse dive kick wayyy to much. Rufus jump is so slow a Ryu or Shoryu based character will usually focus on your dive kick and punish it either jump back HP or just shoryu on reaction. Use this as your advantage. Do short safe whiff dive kick in front of them to bait their reaction. If you hit them with a dive kick and they block just do nothing youre  on hitblock so technically opponent can only throw or shoryu you. The point in my opinion is always to make an opponent hesitate on his defensive options. Once hes nervous he will stop the shoryu spam because he does not want to be punished. The EXmessiah is more a spam free jail out move when youre pressured. Best time is having  bars to cancel it if opponent block or adding an ultra if it hits. The others versions are practicaly useless. Exmessiah is better because of invicible frames and being a great punishing move. The dive kick is more like a footsie tool. The purpose of the move is to enter and break an opponent tech habits. Lets say you do a dive kick and your opponent blocks you might want to throw him since hes doing it. However if you can predict hes doing it doing another dive kick while hes trying to break you mashing crouch tech LKLP or simply grabbing you while standing LPLK will leave him defenseless. And your dive kick will hit him and you will be able to combo off from this point. That is in short one of the many aspect the dive kick metagame offers. Another use of the dive kick is to punish any low whiffed moves. If a Ryu player abuses his crouch MK for example and you predict it a dive kick will be it clean from the ground and you get a free combo. A blocked dive kick is almost a  mixup for you and your opponent. The advantage will depend on the height where you touch your opponent ideally the feet. You either  do a block string to make is safe fastest move is a f crouch LK or LP throw do another quick dive kick if you feel they will techbreak your throw.If your at disadvantage lets say you hit them at their head because your dive kick was too high either  throw because its your fastest move  a f move just do nothing if you think they will reversal do another instant dive kick if you feel they wanna throw youany other options will get you punished if your opponent has a f move because Rufus does not have any... Snake strike is more valid in his ex version either for a anti air punish or a Jump HK follow up combo. I recommend you to learn to anti air with down MP or standing far HP or standing HP for cross up Rufus has another alternative combo with standing HP gtgt qcf HP or standing MP gtgt down LP gtgt ex qcf  PP. But his  frame are max damage punish version and you can learn it by doing the plinking method search on youtube even vesperarcade covers it. an aracde stick will indeed be a better option since Rufus is an execution heavy character. But Ive seen people being able to pull out on controller. Its really a matter of personal taste. I prefer sticks since its more consistant and meant to be played for fighting games.Some final thoughts  if you wanna be an excellent Rufus player the first thing you should practice is your footsies. Footsies are basically space control and being at the extreme distance where you punish any virtual whiff move. You can either force your opponent to press a button to do it or punish it because you predicted your opponent options based on the distance reading.Rufus crouch HK is very good for whiff punish. Try to search for juicebox footsie guide to have a better understanding of the process. Since Rufus walk speed is very slow he can only rely on either is whiff punish move crouch Hk which leads to knockdown and agressive dive kick metagame.Most of Rufus winning lies in good punishing combos and dive kick mix up especially when you have your ultra which is your main come back factor. Hope this could help you understand this character in better way. Have fun using him !!! ,SF4,chcs2ds,3,t5_2r4cj

1062062,0,t3_2692ji,Its weird how some characters just got lateral changes and the new systems were left to decide if they were improved or neglected. Balrog got a faster reliable but useless damage wise overhead and slight quality of life buffs to his standard game. His U on the other hand was fixed and simultaneously nerfed to do metreless BnB damage making it remain inferior to U except for maybe a few match ups where shitty wake up is certain. Abel got nerfed all round because his buffs were mostly concerning his vortex game and that was hit harder by delay standing. The balance team must have really focused their time one the most popular characters and T. Hawk where only the most dominant characters got significant nerfs and the other well played characters got substantial buffs. The changes seems reek of not prioritizing their focus on characters that needed it but only on those who were going to be used the most.  ,SF4,chp0epr,2,t5_2r4cj

1324372,0,t1_ciillzc,the mak video or the ken video?I dont think the button you plink with for makoto matters the punch button The kick buttons change as he uses a different strength of kick for the axe kick. Much like the ken player does.There might be some difference with the punch button used it both cases but if I had to guess I would say it didnt matter at all. Air normals at least most of them dont effect your characters movement path. So any normal that abided by that rule should do fine.  I dont think you could do a command dive kick on akuma for instance but a normal move should work  i think it just about changing some state property of your character in the game.But as with most weird bugs in video games a lot of the time it wont fully make sense why something is happening. Thats part of the reason they werent caught in the first place and can be very hard to fix.,SF4,ciilxfq,1,t5_2r4cj

1795321,0,t1_ck5crqy,Well I just use the standard  controller which happens to fit perfectly in between a space on the handlebars so I can set it down whenever I need to. Ive tried a variety of different games while using it and SF works best for me though I never really played any sort of fighter before I got my bike mostly due to the fast pace. So what I do is just do random matches so I can quit or take a break in between opponents and then stand and increase intensity in between rounds. Works surprisingly well although my bike is broken at the moment got a warranty just waitin for the part. Ill upload a pic of my setup in a bit if ya want.,SF4,ck5g6s7,1,t5_2r4cj

Maybe that feedback is not useful for the people who try to find the underlying problem but it is still feedback.The topic has to be brought up again and again because if everyone just shuts up about it noone will bother to fix it. For a lot of people the game is in an unacceptable state and as customers they have the right to complain about a malfunctioning product. Capcom does not have the best reputation when it comes to fixing their games.gtOP literally just started a hate thread and sat back to enjoy the circle jerkComplaining about a broken game is not a hate thread.

The weekly threads for replays were originally designed to promote players who might otherwise not want to post to do so. We want to help as many people as possible get better at SF and some people might be too embarassed to make their own thread.The line between text questions  friend requests and posting videos of replays is where we draw the line for removing content. Its just the best possible way for people to get help and we dont want to stifle that in any respect! This subreddits goal is to help people get better after all. Were trying to take an active role in that rather than just sitting back and being stream monsters.Our current set of rules have two guidelines at the bottomOne guideline for finding players and the other for posting questions. These are both text posts that end up being small and personal rather than engrossing or helpful. Videos from other redditors no matter their skill level have the extra ability of helping others at that skill level see flaws in their own game too. Again sorry for the confusion!

If he isnt fireballing but looking for HP because he thinks youre in range stay right outside that range and get him to whiff it. WHEN HE WHIFFS IT that is when you can fireball and dash in because now he has to recover from HP and you have a ton of time to then take advantage and get your fireball out on screen first this is importantSpacing is keeeeey,SF4,ckmz8xn,2,t5_2r4cj

The key word here is Attack  youre not canceling into RF and then dashing out of it youre completely right there isnt a difference between regular focus and red focus when you dash out of it youre cancelling into RF and letting it hit. This is a dumb idea with regular focus unless that one extra hit will kill or something but with Red Focus that single hit will always crumple even on a level  red focus attack. That means you can go into whatever crumple combo you want which for a lot of characters means an Ultra that they normally couldnt hit.

We have a google document we link through our wiki which is pretty good but it isnt up to date and I am not even sure who updates it and how they decide to update things.I also think it depends on the type of content you guys want to see on the front page.

2328119,0,t1_cj6ko50,Why recovery?  Arent you cancelling from the active frames?  So how would recovery factor in when it isnt even played?Wouldnt it be the hit stun  recovery  dash duration  ?Hit stun is how much frame advantage you have on hit after the entire attack plays out.  If youre cancelling at the active then there is no recovery.  So you subtract recovery but then add in dash duration   for the focus animation.   or  a few frames depending on what active frame you cancel on.  This is what makes sense to me at least.,SF4,clzgvkr,1,t5_2r4cj

2500601,0,t1_cmkip2g,Nah thats cool man i get you. With that in mind i had to relate to how i got into this game. My roommates in college played and just by being around them i picked it up. I understand your thought process but I feel like for beginners to this game maybe its a little bit overwhelming to be showing big tournaments with top players. When I started I didnt even know there was tournaments. I thought this was just a game that people played online and it ended there. When I started finding out little by little that there are enormous tournaments where thousands of people enter it kinda scared me. So I respect what youre trying to do. I respect that!My two cents If I made a documentary or whatever video this would be my direction through and throughGet them interested in the game itself. The only way to get more playersexposure is to show viewers why we love this game. Why we spend countless hours practicing combos. Why this game is different from every other game. What this game means to everyone. Why people play choose certain characters as their mains. Everyone that plays this game has some sort of emotional connection to it whether they admit it or not otherwise no one would have stayed with it. Show players lives off stream you know? Personally Im much more interested in why others have stayed so loyal to this style of game rather than showcasing a tournament.Obviously this requires interviews and resources that I dont have but it would be amazing to see something like this from start to finish.,SF4,cmkystt,3,t5_2r4cj

2995120,0,t3_2udz8h,Elf is strong because the FGC in general does not want to learn the match up on account of them thinking hes a joke character or cheap and giving all credit to Pepeday for being a low tier hero. Make no mistake Pepeday has put in the work to make his character strong. I have a couple of strong Fuertes in my area and am very thankful to them for playing the character so I can learn the match up with confidence. Heres some tipsplease chyme in if I have incorrectly stated anything or have left something out. El Fuerte has  things he can after he enters a run Stop. This can be used as a mixup for a point blank normal throw or ticktortilla propeller set up and even Q bomb. There isnt anything inherently threatening about this move. Pay attention to the set up and player tendencies. One more thing Fuerte can Rungtstop gtslide at a safe distance giving them a throw set up afterwards. Note the distances. Flop. This is the overhead splash you are probably most familiar with. This can be blocked left or right or Focus Attacked through. Do not try and reversal your way out of this move. Fuertes that hit you with this know that you dont know and will continue blowing you up. Example of a simple punish on block SweepProtip El Fuerte makes a noise when he does a splash when English voices are turned on. He does not make a noise when he goes for the grab. This is reversed with Japanese voices turned on. Grab. This can be avoided with a jump back normal neutral jump or even a back dash. You can reversal this attack. Punish this move with a fast far reaching attack. Think Shoto sweep. Check your spacing on this one as   spaces is close to maximum distance vs normal sized characters. A common set up is once a Fuerte has you cornered they will harass you with a block string before back flipping into the grab. React to the back flip with a jump back normal.Protip As mentioned above Fuerte will not make a noise when executing this move with English voices turned on. This is the reverse for Japanese.  Slide. As the name implies Fuerte goes into a slide that must be blocked low. This is usually used as a final tool in the mix up game. Except for a maximum distance use this move is very easy to punish on block. Go nuts. Finally the Run can be executed as an EX move giving El Fuerte  hits of armor. If he EX runs to the wall he can get  more hits of armor resulting in  focus attacks. This can be used to EX Run cancel instantly into Ultra .This completes the Run options for Fuerte. Quesadilla Bombchest bump This move must be charged by the Fuerte by holding down a kick button. You must respect this move like you would a horizontal shoryuken. The EX version has some very good invincibility properties that can give Fuerte a strong wake up option and antifireball tool. This move is also punishable as hell on block. At  on block feel free to come up with any punish you want including most ultra combos. Example Kens Ultra  is a fantastic punish with a start up of  frames and good extending hitboxIf you can dont hesitate to take a peek at the Fuertes buttons to see which ones they have held down. It could save your life.WARNING Elf can red focus this move on block leaving you to eat a shit load of damage from a Run Stop Fierce or Ultra. Usually the set up for this comes from how often you punish a blocked chest bump. They bump you block you go to punish like usual and end up eating a Red Focus. Watch their meter.Addressing Run Stop FierceRun Stop Fierce is some of the highest damage that a Fuerte can punish with. These loops are very damaging and often lead into Red Focus or a reset of sorts. This behaves just like any other Run input. They can suddenly go into Flop Grab or Slide. Do not mash reversal for this reason. Once youre in a RSF loop just eat the damage until they either finish with a reset or drop the combo. Again even if they drop it a reversal is very risky as the spacing and frames of Close Hard Punch will usually recover. You can prepare for a counter attack by watching the range of Fuerte as they hit the RSF loops. The longer the combo the farther away Furete will push when hitting you. You can anticipate splash by teching the RSF with focus attack. This covers a dropped combo slide or reset splash. Assuming youre not cornered you can try a back dash to avoid a rungrab reset. Quacamole Leg Throwair grabNot much to say about this one. Properly spaced this is one of El Fuertes strong antiair options. The EX version is very fast and has little recovery on landing so it is often used as a way to escape the corner. This can trade weirdly with jump in normals. UltrasUltra the one where he jumps on your head is a very strong tool than can catch a ton of things namely jump ins. Jumping away from this attack serves as a good option. Most Fuertes will not take this Ultra.    Ultra the slidegrapple. Firstly this move is a GRAB. You cannot block this. Time and time again I see people get scooped up by this ultra simply because they were caught holding back. This ultra has a good amount of low profile and invincibility at the start up so it can be used to get in under fireballs in case of a frame trap situation. Neutral jump or reversal this move on the way in. Do what ever you want just dont block. My final thoughts on Elf are this I feel he plays at the same spaces as a solid Ryu would. Respect the chest bump and know the maximum ranges of rungtbackflipgtgrab and the match is much easier. Once you under stand the ranges of this character the match up feels much more manageable. A solid punish for Chest bump is needed to win at higher levels. Too many people let that move go for free. Lots of people play this character differently so picking up on patterns is important. Good luck!Edited for formatting.,SF4,co8fx98,5,t5_2r4cj

3027586,0,t3_2uqpre,Lets discuss the AIThe AI actually does different things according to the character.Who do you think is the bestworst to play against?I never play an AI Cody Ken or Balrog because they Zonk knuckle through everything DP through any gap in a blockstring seriously its fucked and turnaround punch all the time. Its really annoying pretty dumb not realistic at all and just not fun to play against. Oddly enough Ryu doesnt seem to DP through blockstrings. I play against AI Ryu and Guile because theyre pretty fair although dont use Ultra  for Ryu or U for Guile because the AI will often quite literally let it rip the immediate moment you press a button.How do you think they could improve the AI in SF?Obviously its pretty difficult to program good AI but I think they should add at least a ms  frames delay for a lot of things to mimic human reaction times and maybe shorten it if algorithyms show you do a lot of the same stuff.Overheads and tick throws dont really work on the AI either they always seem to block overheads and tech tick throws. However on the other hand they never seem to tech Kara throws and you can get perfects all day on the hardest difficulty by holding down a focus attack to level . Try it its the easiest way to complete arcade mode. They just block. Like the devs programmed in the AI and then added in focus attacks.,SF4,cobt2jh,2,t5_2r4cj
3031440,0,t1_coc72ev,Its pretty amazing just how damn predictable the AI can be.If youre playing against Seth just hold down back and he doesnt know what to do.

3115454,0,t1_cokqggl,I cant guarantee that this is what is messing you up but in Ultra Ken not sure about Akuma and my main Sakura got a nerf that prevents them from moving forward when doing a tatsu while they still have upwards momentum in their jumps. This was to prevent them from really easily escaping corner against characters that rely on that because they could just roflcopter out of there.The way to avoid doing an air tatsu in place like this is to input the move after youve reached the apex of your jump and have started falling down again.,SF4,cokwzvo,1,t5_2r4cj
