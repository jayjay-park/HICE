3306299,0,t3_2y0ljy,Some musicians around the world are obvious living legends Paul McCartney Bob Dylan Mick Jagger Neil Young David Bowie etc. Theyre all pretty old and their legacy is established.So my question is who do you think is the youngest musician to qualify as a proper legend?The youngest one I can think of whos surely a legend is Thom Yorke . Maybe Kanye  but Im not sure Ill consider him that. Cant think of anyone else.What do you think?,musichate,cp557dd,1,t5_36zj7
