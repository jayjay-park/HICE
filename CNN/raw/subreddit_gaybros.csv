The more celebrities come out the less people will feel like they have to hide and the more people will come around because their idols opened their eyes.There are straight male idiots claiming he cant be gay because hes too good at football and a gay guy would be terrible.Why do you want him to hide in the closet? Im the same age as he is and I know what its like to be a closeted adult. The difference is he has the opportunity to change lives and change perceptions.

But that would be missing the point either the poster is more rainbow already so the case is he isnt limiting himself but rather asking what rgaybros think of the issue.

When you advise OP to be more broad while theres no corresponding onus on gaybros to behave the same way thats a double standard. Thats wrong.Third racism amongst gaybros is not offtopic. Its kind of incredibly relevant. And like I already said in my first comment its not the bro way to try to avoid these things. Rather than insinuating that these posts are offtopic the right thing to do is to encourage an environment where these talks can happen.

They are just trying to escape the extremely flawed paradigm of supernaturalism. The true foundation of morality is that it is wrong to cause suffering to other sentient beings. And no matter what you believe the golden rule holds fast treat others the way you want to be treated. You dont need magic for this to make sense. Its just reasonable. If you want to have a good quality of life dont go around ruining the quality of life of others as it will send blowback onto you. Treat others well and they may be inclined to do the same.

Usually people with a family history of mood disorders will have endogenous depression. Having endogenous depression is better helped with medication.I am not sure how much my sexuality contributed to my depression. I was not out at the time however I was struggling with other things. I coped well until my first mood episode at age  of depression. It was not my worst depression but it was different from the usual sadnesshopeless that went away the next day. I slept all day ate nothing melancholic and nothing cheered me up. It went on for months until the depression cleared up on its own only to return again in much greater severity in a year or two later. No amount of therapy or exercise helped with my depression in fact I would not advice anyone who experiences severe physical symptoms from their depression to exercise. It led to an injury.

198170,0,t1_cf0zbk6,That is patently and utterly not at all the point.Sure its the doctors responsibility. Absolutely . I work with doctors all the time and . of the time they fully inform their patients. It is their responsibility and job to make sure you understand completely what you are getting into.That does nothing at all whatsoever to absolve you of your responsibility as a patient to help your doctor do that to ask every single fucking question you can possibly think of about your procedure and do your own research both with and without your doctor to make sure you and your healthcare team are making the best decision. There is a misconception that the attending physician is the doctor making the calls in a healthcare team. In reality it is the patient themselves that call the shots. It is no ones job but theirs to make sure they are fully informed. Everyone in the team is supposed to be the advocate for the patient but ultimately it is the patient that has to live with the results or tragically not live of the procedure.It is the best lesson I ever learned in life and one that will serve me well for my entire life. You have GOT to be your own advocate in absolutely EVERYTHING you do or want. From signing up for classes and insisting that your adviser get you into the classes you want to making sure you know everything you need to and more about the medical procedures you are about to undergo to making sure you ASK your partners directly if they have or could possibly have HIV or another STD. That doesnt mean they wont lie but that is the risk you take I suppose. Minimizing those risks and advocating for your needs in the however short lived relationship go hand in hand.No one can do that job for you ever. Sure it is lying by omission if the person doesnt disclose. But that protects absolutely no one. It is not their job to tell you precisely because they dont have a dog in the game. They are already infected they might not care about you past getting their rocks off. The problem I have with the discussion is that of attitude. Just because the doctor ought to tell you about all the risks just because your hook up ought to tell you he has herpagonasyphilaids doesnt mean they will. Taking responsibility for your own needs is paramount to staying safe and getting the most out of every relationship.,gaybros,cf10ia5,2,t5_2tdzg

Because my Biochemistry degree would have me believe otherwise. Besides Paleo advocates for eating as many vegetables add you can so its a bit of a moot point. gtIn general some of the prohibitions are irrationalahistoric to the whole anthropological record and relying on a snapshot in time as a bible of dietary needs seems shortsighted.I hate this misconception about Paleo. Yes it started as a lifestyle built around our best guesses of what palaeolithic humans wouldve eaten. However it also acknowledges that weve got a wealth of nutritional science to draw from to further inform our dietary choices. Palaeolithic man wouldnt have eaten rice for example but we know that it is relatively harmless as long as you use the energy it provides you and dont overconsume. Lots of Paleo athletes thus eat rice. Anyone who only uses the anthropological justification for the diet is certainly uninformed  ,gaybros,cf1klu9,3,t5_2tdzg

212535,0,t1_cf2mkio, Agree with you. But due to that we as a user have to take every interaction on there with a grain of salt sense of humour and thick skin. Social Media Facebook Grindr etc is a Wild West with no hard and fast rules about what is and isnt socially acceptable  we have what we feel is social acceptable individually but is it wrong for us to judge the stay at home mom who posts inspiring quotes everyday? All I am saying is that if you liked this guy and he liked you he wouldnt DISLIKE you for an accidental transgression  as long as you explained that. Because if thats the mistake that throws him over what will happen when you burn the lasagna?As a queer individual we have the opportunity to redefine our interactions to be less judgemental and to be more supportive of each other. Conservative views that sexuality is wrong in ourself or others doesnt help evolve us as a whole. Dont beat yourself up over having a dick pic for accidentally sharing it or for even being open about your desires. Learn from the mistake and move forward laughing at the slip up.

Also if youre a serial monogamist rather than a casual sex practitioner youre already lowering your risk.

270523,0,t1_cf8rwzl,I dont think the LGBT community should condemn all living Christians for thousands of years of misinterpreted text. Its not like most Christians pray that all homosexuals are killed converted etc. And regarding that minority they still have the right to do so... just not actively harm others. And when they do the LGBT community should defend itself rather than attack the foundation of Christianity. Ultimately arguing is feeding the fire and not contributing to a solution. The LGBT community cant forgetignore Christianitys role in our current situation but a little tolerance on both sides goes a long way. I think it starts with education the LGBT community needs to see an accurate picture of Christianity while the Christians need to understand how harmful their antiLGBT doctrines can be when communicated in a a particular manner. But again they still have the right to share their beliefs... just as you have the right to reply. ,gaybros,cf8st5u,1,t5_2tdzg

Only that finding an opposite sex relationship is x easier and sustaining one publically is still easier than a same sex one. So it would make sense that people choose those more.Id assume the angst youre talking about probably comes from the fact that youre trying to say they might as well be straight like its a choice. They would like to be known as bi because thats what they feel they are. Its no different from being gay and being told why not just be straight its easier you get more benefits. They like who they like and yes because they can like both sexes and get approached more by the opposite sex they will more often be in opposite sex relationships but that correlation doesnt mean all bi people are more heterosexual than not as much as it is just an odds game.,gaybros,cfdguwi,1,t5_2tdzg

Its unfortunately how our system of parties is ran but if you want to go anywhere in a party you have to follow the guidelines the party has set about certain issues.

375972,0,t1_cfjn85i,You need to stop with the ad hominem attacks. They only serve to discredit you and your position. Maybe instead you would be interested in a real conversation?In your writing you conflate a good number concepts. I dont think you make a significant effort to differentiate between femininity and how that term can be applied as in female prescribed to gender as in effeminate a descriptor of social behavior and character traits traditionally expected of women as in effeminate to describe a gay stereotype flamboyantqueenFirst of all at the end of the day I feel think and see myself as a man. I wouldnt use any other term to describe my gender. If you were addressing a transgender FTM you probably wouldnt shriek Hey guurrrrl. That is because you respect that they identify differently. Why wouldnt respect a cisgender man straight or gay the same why?In light of some of my character traits and some of my interests I think society would cast me as more feminine than your stereotypical man. In general Im more sensitive and more invested in the people around me getting along. Last year I got really into an artist went to their concert and was surprised that almost everyone in attendance was a girl or gay. First Marina and the Diamonds concert I was like whatthefuckamIsopredictable?. I have no problem being seen as effeminate in this way. I dont see femininity as inferior  some of the most powerful intelligent talented resourceful and honest people I know are women. One of these women happens to see herself as oneoftheguys and shot guns beers with us. She enjoys that label and we joke about it. But this assertive athletic neuroscientist still identifies as a woman. Great right? I wont judge what labels and jokes you and your friends are comfortable with. Amongst yourselves I dont assume there are any implications to your use of genderedpronouns. Finally fem as in the flaming gay stereotype is obviously more loaded variant of the term in this forum. I have no problem with guys basking in this stereotype and they should feel empowered by society to do so. I wont flip out if a guy approaches me at a bar and says Hey gurrl whatre you drinking? But that isnt me. If that person and I were to become friends Id expect them to be okay not referring to me that way. And we might not become friends if they embody the obnoxious dramatic and hysterical aspects of the stereotype. I find such behavior taxing from anyone manwomangaystraight. When dealing with people you need to take a step back find out what makes them comfortable and respect them for that.  Sure you can try to educate them with regard to facts and express your opinions. But dont vilify them for their opinions and preferences especially if they dont negatively impact anyone.Yikes I apologize for writing so much. Some of this was partially written for myself in order to sort out my thoughts on the matter. But I hope you do take the time to read it. I think there is some decent advise here. I find your writing vindictive and your tone militant. To me that suggests you are dealing with your own insecurities. Then again most people are. ,gaybros,cfjqgqg,6,t5_2tdzg

410175,1,t3_1ypt5a,Although I oppose the Arizona antigay law passed by the state legislator because it gives power to religious organizations so they can sue for discrimination I do support private sector discrimination being legal for ANY group of people.  If a business doesnt want to serve to people because of their race sexuality gender religion etc. thats their right to do so.  We shouldnt divide people into their own special classes that need to be protected.  Thats what MLK talked about when he said dont judge people by the color of their skin or sexual orientation but by the content of their character.Now that being said I think any form of discrimination.  Any business that discriminates should be immediately boycotted.If a business or organization is public or takes any kind of tax payer money thats different and shouldnt discriminate because we all pay taxes and government shouldnt discriminate against one group or other but the private sector should not be intervened by the government to set policy.Freedom means stuff that dont like.

502187,0,t3_1zuv32,For me I feel like forgiveness is not about squaring past deeds or contextualising mistreatment its mostly about a mental shift that you undergo yourself for your own wellbeing a resolve to not hold onto old pain or old memories.You know i think sometimes we go through life feeling like were owed something like were owed a basic level of dignity or respect. In some senses we are as a species we need some baseline to aspire to in order to collectively move forward but certainly on an individual level its a crap shoot some people are blessed in life and some people are not we have to make do with the cards we are dealt and resolve to be part of the solution going forward.Family is a difficult thing to deal with and just as you had no choice in the family you were born in your family had no choice in the culture or cultural attitudes they were born into. Although I do think that people are really only the sum of their experiences in life I dont think it completely absolves them of responsibility or at least it doesnt let them off the hook when it comes time to change attitudes about something. This is really something youre going to have to feel out with your family over the next few years you know they say blood is thicker than water so perhaps they will surprise you.I had a lot of difficulty with my coming out my family are all evangelical christians and were heavily involved in that whole dogmatic scene my dad was a preacher in the fellowship. It took me a long time to come to any sort of peace. I resented the pain my family put me through for many years afterwards especially I blamed my father for his weakness and the betrayal i felt at his hands. I struggled with depression and self esteem and all of that eventually i realised that I couldnt control what happened around me and I couldnt go back and change what had already happened in life all I could do was adjust my own reaction not even my feelings at first because theyre so ingrained and unconcious just the way I reacted to my own circumstances and the choices I made thats all I had control over. After a while those actions start influencing the way you think and your emotional reaction to things around you.I think as you say youre on the right path already making changes and being financially stable and so on it all adds up for sure the less things in your life that need active attention the better it will let you focus on having the mental and emotional fortitude to deal with things that perhaps you havent dealt with yet. Anyway I think you will be fine mate! You seem to have a good head on your shoulders from this post. All the best.,gaybros,cfxcopy,1,t5_2tdzg

Like do you think its possible to just turn the emotional responses on and off or do you think that tap dancing back and forth between just sleeping around and looking for something more may make the latter more difficult?

Im not trying to hookup with anyone hence why I dont use them.I dont get what you mean by my sexual nature part so youll have to be more clear. And as for me getting defensive. I wasnt. If you look most of the guys here said  Im stuck up or on a high horse which is completely untrue. I dont think wanting to pace anything is bad but Im mostly on here getting criticized for it. Im not judging the gay community as a whole if you look at my initial posting and get past the sexual part youll see what Im really asking is if this is what is considered the norm and from what everyone has told me it is.Tell me why do most guys in the age group i listed just want to fool around?  I never understood why people want to just hit it and quit it but I guess I never will. Its not for me and to each their own.,gaybros,cgfrfmh,1,t5_2tdzg
667379,0,t3_21rsd8,I lived in Botswana for half a year. Homosexuality is illegal there though the young people are generally pretty tolerant. I also traveled a bit to Zimbabwe and Zambia which have similar lawsculture regarding homosexuality. It really depends on how much youre willing to be discreet. If you want to go hook up with guys every weekend youre probably better off not going to Uganda. But if youre willing to give up sex for the time that youre there and you think its worth the internship do it. You might find that the younger people are more openminded than the older folks. I dont know how religion is in Uganda but in Botswana it was generally the Christian folks who were more homophobic. Wherever you go the sector that is younger and more educated will be more tolerant. ,gaybros,cgg4p57,3,t5_2tdzg

690613,0,t3_22213t,Is there any chance that you might make a good case with your family for you to go to study at a university in a western country?  Perhaps using the argument of getting the best education in a particular field...It could be a way for you to find an out...I grew up in a rural conservative Catholic farming community in the Midwest region of the US in the s.  I had zero examples of healthy gays around me and no reason to believe that my family would be accepting.  As Ive said in other Reddit posts I also had no concept of what it was like to be openly gay so much so that when I reached puberty I could only imagine myself as a girl having sex with a guy because I had no examples of two males having sex. It took awhile till my midtwenties actually but via scholarships at universities outside this region I was able to come into a new experience of myself and to come out of the closet.  In short use whatever experience you can to give yourself a leg up or a headstart on breaking out of where you are at least for long enough to come into your own...Dont ever think that you are alone AND dont ever think no one has had it as bad you do even today there are lots of guys out there who dont even have access to the internet!.

693351,0,t3_2237qg,Unfortunately your experiences are pretty common among young gay guys.  Gay people dont get the datingsex crash course that straight people get to go through in middle and high school.  I think this leads to a lot of young gay guys not being mature enough for apps like grindr.  It really sucks you had some really bad experiences on there but you even admit you basically searched them out.  You need to take ownership of your past and see that while grindr was a tool you used to inflict more harm on yourself it was not the source.  It sounds like you have grown and are in a much better place and I am happy for you in that aspect.  Im worried that your therapist and your past experiences might send you down a sex negative road which is only going to cause more problems in the long run so maybe seek out a sex positive therapist that can help you work through any shameful feelings sex causes you. Its great that abstaining from sex has helped you to heal but dont let that make you feel like your better than a slutty person. Different people can be happy and healthy all over the prudeslut spectrum.  Search out the kind of sex you want if that means only in a monogamous relationship there are plenty of people out there that feel the same.  If its random hookups be safe and know that there is nothing wrong with that either. ,gaybros,cgj33x0,9,t5_2tdzg

728651,0,t3_22hlzx,OK so  isnt old and I myself am not actually old  this year but aging doesnt happen like a trigger it happens of course over time.  These days my hands hurt sometimes built a log house for my ex with them so they hurt and losing weight seems near impossible although I have bouts of really good fitness just not thinness.  Hair is turning white and migrating south from my head to shoulders and stopping on the journey to rest in my nose and ears.  Oh and then moving to my back.  These are all really manageable effects of aging nothing to be actually afraid of and again they dont happen all at once so you have time to come to terms with one before the next rears its head.  At some point you will notice the pile of things you have gotten used to and that moment youll feel old and say this sucks but it really doesnt.  My brother died at  of lung cancer left  kids behind.  My aching hands and migrating hair high blood pressure none of that is worse than what he got out of life. Enjoy your body while it hurts less do the things you want while your body will cooperate and then when the body hurts do the things you like that wont be affected by joint pain and some minor mobility limitations. Other than that remember that life is to be enjoyed spend time with people you like respect trust and admire.  Have all the fun with them they are willing to participate in.  Then if things slow down you have no regrets.   Best of luck to you getting old beats the alternative.,gaybros,cgn3ngg,1,t5_2tdzg

824243,0,t3_23jf8h,Came here to say pretty much everything that all the other great comments here have. Theres a lot of literature out there on the Internet about this that I strongly suggest you read. This is just a brief summary of what I thought worked best for me when I struggled with my sexuality and my faith. I think a great place to start is obviously Scripture and tackling the main verses that are normally used against us. Youll find that there are only a couple of passages in the Bible that refer to men having sex with men with one passage referring to lesbian sex as well. The Old Testament references for one are a part of the old law which we as Christians are freed from which is why we can eat shellfish do not have to be circumcised etc. and even if we werent the contexts in which homosexual acts are prohibited in the Old Testament are definitely questionable Sodom is more of a gangrape of two innocent travelers rather than an example of a committed gay relationship. In the New Testament the words translated as homosexuals in English are translations two vague Greek terms either arsenokoitai manbed or malakoi soft both of which can refer to a whole range of things. Taking it further this is evidence that others have already shared about the centurions servant and the relationship between Jonathan and David. From a fuller understanding of scripture and exactly what those verses means you can negate any argument against Christian homosexuality. Taking that away means that I no longer feel like I have to choose between faith and who I am on the contrary Scripture empowers me to be an even more faithful and loyal servant of God. A gay Christian is not a hypocrite.After Scripture the second half to tackle is the Christian community. I was able to realize that my relationship with God is loving but that doesnt necessarily mean that your faith community will be as accepting as Jesus is. This often is where some people feel they have to choose one or the other as you say. However there are many LGBT affirming denominations of Christianity as someone has linked below. While a personal relationship with God is paramount a solid network and Christian community is important and beneficial to any believer. Like I said check out the literature written on this topic and most importantly pray about it! God wants you to fully understand this issue and what he intends to come out of it. He can help you through this turmoil and bring you to peace.TLDR The basis for Christian homophobia comes from misinterpretation of Scripture. Understanding what these verses actually mean coupled with a strong affirming faith community will help lead you to a stronger relationship with Christ and an acceptance of your sexuality and your faith.,gaybros,cgxyv6f,3,t5_2tdzg

Or finally seeing the sun still waiting here in NYC after a dark winter.  Recently I saw my niece crying after her first school play ended. She was brokenhearted the production was over that something special was gone for her.  That moment however made me stop.

The onsen is a true hot spring and the sento is a manmade bath from what I understand. The sentos I went to were really hopping with people having a good time. Much more lively than the guys in the video but I think time of day matters. Even though you can do a bath at home my take was that the sento was like a getaway like going to the gym after a stressful work day. Its for the relaxation not just to get clean.Theres even super sentos that have all kinds of tubs like ones with jets and even electrified ones.

Unlike basic gender privilege racial privilege and arguably class privilege that are immutable where you live is something you chose.

If you think it would put you in any serious danger or would make you lose someone you are dependent on financially then hold off for a bit.  Furthermore since you dont seem definitive about it yourself yet you may want to hold off telling anyone.  Do you have any friends you can trust? You can try and seek their help about the feelings you have.  Hell you might be somewhere in between straight and gay or either! Also you can just try dating and see where it takes you.

Im not going to stop you.The fact that I prefer one subreddit to another doesnt mean I dont want to stay active in both and up until today I didnt need to determine whether I preferred one to the other because the communities were linked. You created that schism you forced that choice. Id love to go back to enjoying both.gt Thats because a huge number of subscribers have also completely stopped following this sub. Its not because mod actions have driven them away its because they came here to be guys first gay second and instead found rainbow. In my opinion theres nothing wrong with that and I wont apologize for this view. It doesnt mean that I hate effeminate gays that I am incapable of being a good father that my parents dont love me that I have serious internalized homphobia that Im die! cis scum that I hate all aspects of Pride or that Im a variety of other insults that have been lobbed or cobbled against me in the past few days. Frankly I took the weekend off from modding to go shooting and riding and I came back to find that everything had simply exploded. Jesus Christ.How does this answer my question like literally at all? This doesnt address at all what I asked. Youre talking about people not following the sub anymore Im talking about people participating in threads today voicing their opinions about the direction youve taken active right now in the subreddit. Perhaps some of them are gone now because you deleted their poststhat does tend to drive people awaybut they were here as recently as this afternoon. gt This sub will remain a sub that is dedicated to guy things. Im sorry that it cant be a catchall but Im sure there are a great number of other subs that can cater to what youre looking for. Looking at our front page right now theres hardly any serious difference between rainbow and rgaybros in terms of content. We will pair that down even if it causes us to have growing pains.Why is what the users may want not entering your consideration at all? Who do you moderate for? Thread after thread posted by the mods trying to calm and appease the masses is overrun with opposition to your agenda and all you do is continue to bury your head in the sand.To an extent I understand the frustration you guys must havetheres no question that rgaybros has strayed somewhat from the original purpose. But when online communities grow they dont necessarily grow to your specifications especially when they start getting broad attention. Are you willing to alienate a majority of your communitys wishes just to enforce your idea of what guy stuff is? Do you really think the community will survive that?Im a moreorless masculine gay man. I like guy stuff. That doesnt mean I support actively antagonizing other gay men for their interests and that doesnt mean I want to create a gated community. Based on the reaction you guys have gotten time and time again thread after thread I think I stand with many others on that.gt Yes which we are in our right as mods to do. We dont even vaguely delete a fraction of the shit that most subs do and Im tired of being portrayed as some autocrat for merely exercising editorial control.In our right fine. But why? And why are you surprised when users get upset about it? Do you not see that if you really have to resort to mass deletion and obfuscation your moderation agenda might not be that popular? And again who do you moderate for?P.S. Ive said my peace and Ive said my piece are both accepted Ive always thought Ive said my piece makes more sense but alas but if were being snarky and grammatical...gt We will pare that down even if it causes us to have growing pains.FTFY.,gaybros,cighl2i,7,t5_2tdzg

1310050,0,t1_cigok35,gt Everyone I that thread was using the upvotes and downvotes as an agree or disagreeyoure wrong button.I agree with this being a violation of reddiquette in all other cases but in a serious meta discussion this is unavoidable. Its a way for people to express their opinion without repeating what others have already said. Rather than  people saying I agree! those  people upvote a post because they agree with it and want to float it to the top of the discussion. It just makes sense and youre never going to be able to stop it from happening. I dont particularly like the downvoting people you disagree with side of it but upvoting people you agree with makes sense to me.Given thatgt contest mode somewhat removed that bias on otherwise civil discussion.I think it did the opposite. The mods here want to run on a silent majority platformtheyve said as much multiple times. They want to say that despite how many people are complaining and opposing whats going on theres a silent majority who is just fine with what theyre doing. That would be fine if it was true but the massively skewed upvote totals disproved that it showed that the silent majority was and is with the opposition. Contest mode conveniently covered that up and floated the promod comments that had previously had maybe  or  upvotes to the top. It introduced bias through false equivalence.,gaybros,cigzwmw,6,t5_2tdzg

Thats been our central goal since day one.Good. Im looking forward to that part of it.I do have a response to the break eggs to make an omelet statement but I think itd fit better in a response to something you said somewhere else so Ill hold off on that here.gt I want to just take a moment to say how much I appreciate your last two posts which were immensely helpful and insightful.Oh stop it. Im blushing.On a more serious note though I can say the same for your last comment. I started reading it in the angry pitchforkandtorch state of mind I began this situation with but as I read it I found myself much more sympathetic to you and what youre doing. Please show everyone else that side of it. There are always going to be some people who want your head on a stake no matter what but I think that if the whole community read what you said to me there about creating that space for men who feel atrisk or incongruous with the communitymen who feel they are the same as they were before they came outtheyd like you a lot better. Being from a rural smalltown area I know exactly what parishes youre talking about and your words on that really did reach me.

Gaybros started out one way and was owned by the founders. but the founders do not own that community now.Can they increase moderation? Sure. But the community has spoken against that. So as they continue to try and make this community the one they want they systematically start destroying what it already here which can lead to an entire breakdown and collapse of the reddit.

I mean it in a vague sort of way. I dont want every detail of their life and everything they believe over coffee or a light meal. If you think divulging your childhood and your upbringing on a first date are acceptable topics I feel your issues are even more immense then mine. It was just a question though. However discussing politics with my significant other is a very important thing for me. Its something I look for in someone. Not that they have to have aligned beliefs with mine.

1406572,0,t3_2a8epz,Copenhagen specifically and indeed Denmark as a whole is probably the most gayfriendly country in the world. I wouldnt be surprised if both things youve heard are true namely that its good for gays and theres no community. Culturally many Danes believe in culture without emphasis you are welcome to do whatever you like with whomever you like but putting yourself on display is generally if not frowned upon at least uncommon. This isnt just for gay people but indeed anyone  even the wealthy in Denmark dont really show off as much as they do in the states. See So gay people might generally just behave like normal people with regard to social circles if that makes sense and rarely congregate in gayonly crowds. And since theres little to no stigma attached they likely dont feel the need to. To me this is refreshing as it paints a picture of a future with no discrimination against gay people. To others it might be depressing as some people take great comfort in a public gay identity.

Its also ironic given that youve spent so much time talking about how you feel youre intellectually superior to me i.e wow youre a bloody moron. wow youre so dumb I cant bother with this. Its like youre in denial right now. First you say that I never asked any questions even though theyre literally there in this thread. Now you deny saying anything along the lines of No blacks. You never used the word nappy but anyone with half a brain would know what youre referring to when you say stuff like I dont like black peoples hair. The receipts are all there in this thread. End of story.Youre a mess if you think calling out racism is a form of racism. and yes Ive done and said racist things. But I dont anymore because when you know better you do better. So no I dont actually call everyone racists. If you choose to continue whatever it is youre doing on the other hand then I will call you a racist. If anyone needs to look up the definition of racism its you. I dont mean with just a dictionary. Go read up on institutionalized racism go seek out scholarly articles go take a sociology class. A one sentence dictionary definition of racism isnt going to provide you with an allencompassing knowledge of racism how it works its manifestations and its characteristics. ,gaybros,cj8p0rz,1,t5_2tdzg

1535472,0,t3_2btgk4,Im of two minds on the subject. On the one hand Im deeply deeply opposed to shaming anyone...ANYONE for whatever sexual preferences that they might have. Slutshaming and kinkshaming are pet peeves of mine and believe that no one has a platform from which they can issue some kind of ruling on whether or not someones sexual preferences are legitimate.BUTAt the same time I realized that sexual preferences are not formed in a vacuum.  There is no one right or wrong way to be a man. Theres just not but the overwhelming message of popular gay culture including porn is that attractive men are white traditionally masculine chiseledbodied models with  inch dongs that are perpetually hard.  No fats no fems no blacks bro.And if thats what youre attracted to theres nothing wrong with that but if thats ALL youre attracted to well...I dunno that seems like a great opportunity to realize that youve let your concept of what attractiveness is be colored by pop culture. Ill put it another way. I was raised in the south and didnt get a lot of diversity in food when I was younger but love all sorts now. I was taking a friend from home out to dinner one night and he turned his nose up when we ended up at a Thai joint. We argued for the next five minutes over whether he actually liked thai food or not. That motherfucker had never had Thai food in his life and he was trying to tell me he didnt like it. I finally talked him into ordering it and you know what he loved it. I personally dont buy that you cant control what youre attracted to. I think what youre attracted to depends on what you feed it. Personally I try to diversify my tastes as much as possible and if along the way I find something I genuinely dont like after I try it then I steer clear of it the next time. Its a strategy thats served me well and has led me to some amazing guys and fantastic sexual experiences. ,gaybros,cj8qwr1,9,t5_2tdzg

The whole idea that they will do what they want no matter what comes from a time when the only discussion about an issue was Im your father  thats why.  You seem logical and capable of having an honest and rational conversation with your son  so do that.  If the only power you had in this situation was the ability to grant or deny permission then yes  he would most likely defy you in the end  but you have a greater power than that  the power to sway.  Talk to your son about the positives and the negatives  how his age and growth pattern would affect his decision  how it affect him the rest of his life  for good or ill.  In the end the goal isnt to be able to make decisions for your son for  years and then throw him out on his own  but to shape his decision making process and then continue to be a positive factor in that process for the rest of his or your life.  ,gaybros,cjgbr5x,3,t5_2tdzg

Those kinds of people cant last in a fictional relationship no matter how much their partner looks like them. Also me jacking off in the mirror isnt any more related to that personality disorder anymore than watching porn and imagining yourself in the place of one of the actors is.

Venice you can park in Mestre and take the bus thus avoiding a e parking fee pretty much everything. The most amazing city in the world. Verona the arena Juliets castle etc km from Verona theres my hometown Vicenza which is pretty awesome Andrea Palladio an architect from the Reinassance built a lot of magnificent buildings here. fun fact his designs were among the blueprints for the White House.Also theres a lot of Americans living here cuz of military bases. Bologna has an amazing nightlife is a university city also km from there is Ferrara which next weekend hosts the biggest street artists festival of Europe I studied there amazing place! Milan granted its an acquired taste but youll love it. If you book in advance youll also get to see the Last Supper.The newlybuilt area of Garibaldi is quite breathtaking in my opinion I live here during the year.Lots of diverse gay clubs pick your flavor! Along with Bologna the most gayfriendly city in Italy Turin such a lovely place to live so much history and great nightlife too its a great university city. Genoa home of one of the most beautiful Aquariums in Europe its such a surreal place and its so lovely in the summer.Hope this helps if you need any more tips hit me up!

1875241,0,t1_ckemqia,This is why I typically advocate for the disuse of the words.  You defined what being a man  being masculine meant then you admitted that in addition to those qualities you felt you also had qualities that encompassed what being a woman  being feminine meant.  How meaningful then are those identifiers?  And how meaningful is it to categorize a diverse range of interests or qualities as distinctly masculine  maleinterest?The reality is that we attribute these qualities to gender orientations because of a long complicated history of Europeaninfluenced gender roles.  Before I ever did some meaningful thinking or reading about gender I had a very binary model for how people were.  Gradually that model changed.  Im sure youll recognize some of these ways of thinking from what people have written here on gaybros or from a way you previously thought. individuals can either be masculine or feminine a binary system that individuals lie somewhere on the spectrum of masculinityfemininity a twodimensional spectrum masculinity ltgt femininity it should be noted that I was conveniently placed on the masculine side of the spectrum individuals have a variety of masculine or feminine behaviors that define them.  You can think of it like youre creating a sim and you get to choose some qualities from  different dropdown lists.Notice that each step is a more nuanced model than the last.  And with each step any single behavior  interest  quality becomes less relevant to the total gender of the individual.I am very strongly for the idea that gender is extremely dynamic and that interests or behaviors dont have inherent gender assignments.  People are diverse and quirky.  Peoples SES ethniccultural background and age typically play roles in informing their genders.  I didnt just go off on a tangent for no reason  you said that gaybros was the community you created to bond around masculine qualities.  My response is that its unnecessary to group those qualities or more accurately those interests by gender.  If you wanted to create a community for gay men to talk about guns grilling sports and technology you did it.Ive noticed that as time goes on the less the sidebar description is concerned with gender.  We talk about traditionally masculine topics turns into we like guy stuff turns into mens interest community.  What kind of thinking informed these changes?  Were you scared of PCesque criticisms?  Did your thinking about masculinity change?,gaybros,ckf5rar,5,t5_2tdzg

Im under the impression that you can influence peoples choices within a given institution by changing their costbenefit analysis. If sexual assault is more severely punished and punished at a higher rate I would expect it to happen less frequently. Youre right of course well never completely eliminate the problem  there is no accounting for the irrational and crazy.

If theyve been spent tons haphazardly and the problem wasnt resolved that doesnt mean were done attempting to address the problem. I dont think just another layer of bureaucracy would be helpful. I think it would make sense to independently review the existing structure. If its found sufficient thats great. Im assuming that there is not an independent line of reporting for the branches besides the Air Force  because otherwise the drafters of the legislation are well... kind of ignorant. If the AF has this in place perhaps they could simply expand access to the other branches or mimic its structure for the other branches? I think it would be sufficient for my boss to find out ifonce I choose to press charges. I think the decision and ability to press charges shouldnt be influenced by the boss who as you say has an incentive to preserve even a semblance of harmony for the sake of productivity. I suppose the relative importance of productive work environment versus the rule of law is the fundamental level of this debate. If any boss or commander decides prioritize productivity over the rule of law I see that as a fundamental problem. ,gaybros,ckl3vy5,1,t5_2tdzg

So when I met somebody I liked he threatened to kill himself because I was the love of his life and he couldnt live without me. So I went back to him.But he was closeted also and refused to let anybody know about us so while I was trying to be open about my life I had to have a secret boyfriend that only he knew. Im pretty sure most people figured it out and eventually I told several of my friends. But he constantly would belittle my secret boyfriend to everybody. His boyfriend is a real asshole he did this and that and I had to sit there and try to defend him!Theres so much more over that I can rant about but I think that covers  of the big bisexual related issues.

2128779,0,t1_clabzmh,gtIf the pastors are preaching politics from the pulpit I think that the government has every right to get involved. If they want to preach politics they should be paying taxes.Thats totally asinine. There are a multitude of nonprofit groups that encourage very specific voting platforms including the HRC which issues its own Congressional Scorecard. By your logic we should therefore tax and survey the communications of every single nonprofit group in the nation. This is utterly misplaced vitriol.gtOn another level if the sermons were inciting violence I can see why the government should rightly get involved. You can have your own beliefs thats fine but when the pulpit is telling people that God wants them to commit acts of violence they become no better than zealot terrorists.Once again this is a matter for the police not for the City of Houston. If you want to investigate possible violence then you should dispatch the police who will operate under established legal guidelines. Even if we did encounter a church that advocated outright violence against gays we would havea no guarantee that the church would send unredacted or unedited sermonsb a very unlikely chance that any of this would be admissible in a court of lawc a question as to whether or not we have specific legislation that addresses this violenced a strong chance that antigay pastors will switch from violent language to coded language which once again would place us in an even more precarious situation while placing them in the legal cleare an astounding level of animosity towards gay people by evangelical radical Christians many of whom are fencesitting on this subject anywayThis is a stupid piece of guidance and Fox News I cant believe Im saying this analysis of the situation is completely on target.,gaybros,claexns,2,t5_2tdzg

2193120,0,t1_clic6pn,gtIf you agree with the general principle of something that being equality of the sexesWell Ill just pause you right there first. Why did we choose feminism to be the word for the progenderequality movement. You can argue that thats what the movement is about nowadays sure but you cant convince me that that name doesnt come across as womancentric. gtand your own interpretation of it then why does it matter that other people who identify as feminists might disgree with you? Well if there are a lot of people who identify with the same genderissue related movement as me and people disagree with me then theres two outcomes Im afraid of. . People will automatically jump to the conclusion that I do agree with them because we identify the same way. . The people who think differently than me will think that I agree with them because we identify the same way and use it to support the potentially harmful viewpoints. When someone decides to speak for all feminists which happens a lot I get dragged in. gtI of course support gay rights but think that many gay people focus on some issues like gay marriage more than other more important ones like LGBT homelessness transphobia... but that doesnt mean Im going to separate myself from the whole movement and say I dont support it. Its a little different. Supporting LGBT rights isnt the analogous to identifying as a feminist.  Even if you identify as an ally people dont jump to as many conclusions as if you identify as a feminist. The LGBT rights movement is about LGBT rights. Maybe some more than others but over all thats what it is. What is the feminist movement about? Gender equality? Ok sure. But see you can easily say I support gay rights but I dont think gay marriage should be a priority compared to LGBT homelessness or transphobia and people will probably understand. If you said Im a feminist but I think a lot of people are taking this rape culture thing too far or Im a feminist but I dont really think the wage gap says anything about sexism in the workplace at all. or Im a feminist but I think grouping all of societies problems together and pretending they all stem from the same thing the patriarchy is a really unhealthy viewpoint. do you think people would really accept you identifying as a feminist still?The word feminism is associated with so much more than just gender equality.

I have been told some rather harsh things by people I dont know on social media apps. That being said yes it can be unhealthy to be overweight. Yes the bear community can be as judgmental as the twinktwunkfitgym ratetc communities. The issue I see is this. In a community that has already been disenfranchised the gay community there are now fractured communities that dont get along. We tear each other down so no one can be better than the other. What this does though is that it creates selfesteem and body image issues which can lead to eating disorders and even mental problems. And this is transcendent of the different classifications.

Basically the reasons I was a virgin were I had some confidenceshyness issues I lived in a tiny town in the Italian Alps where I only knew other  gay guys and they were all twatsBut then in September last year I moved to London to start university and I slowly got used to being in a big city with an active gay scene. I started going out with a group of other gay students but it still felt a bit awkward Im quite introverted.One night we were all fairly drunk and as we were dancing one of the other students came to me and told me he really liked me and he wanted to kiss me. My brain went blackout for about  seconds and the poor guy was just about to leave when finally the alcohol gave me the courage to tell him that I wanted to kiss him too. So we made out and he proposed to go to his place. On the way there I kept on telling him that I was completely inexperienced and he kept on telling me that he didnt care. That night we didnt do much he told me he wanted me to sober up first so that I wouldnt regret anything so we cuddled for a bit and went to bed. The morning after we blew each other and it felt amazing. I fucked him a couple of days later and it was good although I was way too clumsy. When I finally asked him to fuck me he took a really long time making sure it wouldnt hurt at all. We never really got together none of us was looking for a relationship but we kept on fucking each other and we still do it now sometimes.,gaybros,cmlgpvu,2,t5_2tdzg

I have also found stuff on the CDC.gov that says theoretically if youre bleeding like mad out the mouth and so is your partner its possible but doesnt state that its ever happened.Im thinking the confirmed case is a myth. I cant find a direct this is the case of Joe Smith and his HIV partner John Smiff and only see theorycrafting. No official sites so far say its happened for sure and I only found one site that said its happened once but doesnt really say how or when or the individuals. HmmIm gunna go with theoretically its possible but probably hasnt ever happened. Im not sure why youd be making out with someone when both parties are bleeding profusely.

But now its pretty much science fact in the near future.House of Leaves is pretty thrilling but is more of a metamystery since its the culmination of all things postmodern in postmodern literature.

My typical schedule includes work going home and hanging out with my family and family friends.  I tend to work in positions where most of my coworkers are women  years older than me which isnt the best for making friends and instead of driving  minutes to the big city I travel  minutes to smaller towns where its difficult to meet other young LGBT professionals.  I went to college over  miles away from my home and most of my college friends live in that region.Ideally Im hoping to meet another professional whom I can hug all the time and can have intelligent conversations while doing all sorts of activities.

2753922,0,t1_cnh1l0d,The glut of JDs isnt as bad as it used to be when the recession was hitting and everyone was going back to school but its still a significant problem.  The amount of money being spent on legal services worldwide is going down.  Law firms are scrambling to cut costs and steal business.  The number of lawyers the big law firms are hiring goes down a little bit each year.  And still every year there are more graduates with law degrees than there are lawyers.As for what kind of job youll get youre also right to be concerned.  Well a good job can mean a lot of different things but assuming youre referring to the prestigetrack highsalary kind of job at a bigname big law firm that everyone tells you you should want youre right with a caveat.  You can get a highpaying job at a big law firm out of law school from a lowertier school but its a lot harder than coming from HarvardStanfordYale.  I work in big law and Ive definitely recommended we hire people from law schools outside the Top and the firm has done so in some cases.  But those people were at the very tippytop of their class and edited the law review and were like presidents of everything and interviewed very well.  It can be done but you have to really work at it.Also you should think hard about what you want from a career before launching into law especially big law.  Its stressful long hours working with clients who are either at their most stressed at their most untrustworthy or on their worst behavior.  The money is good and reasonably dependable but it top out nearly as high as say investment banking or the many things you can do with a business degree.  And even high degrees of success in this world often lead to a miserable lifestyle.  Ive seen too many unhappy people at all levels of my profession.  Being a partner at a law firm making millions of dollars a year wont really make you happy if you hate your job your life and the person youve become.  Think not just about what you want to have in five or ten years think about how you want to feel in five or ten years.So now that Ive covered all the reasons why not to do it heres why you might want to law is a field of inquiry based on a unique and weird melding of politics philosophy intuition and language.  On a good day at work I come home feeling like Ive been solving puzzles all day figuring out how all the little pieces of what happened can do or should fit in with the little pieces of how things have worked in the past and how things ought to work in a perfect world to come up with an answer that feels fair fits how things have worked in the past and would be an acceptable outcome to my client.  Standing up in court on someone elses behalf is exhilarating and stressful and awful and amazing all at once.  Words will come out of your mouth and you will have no memory of what you just said.  If you end up doing transactional work you will get to watch dozens or hundreds of companies or deals be born and live through their life cycles building and selling products and services that the people and businesses around you rely on.  And you will have helped them avoid the pitfalls and dangers that could have derailed their path to success because you already thought about every possible thing that could go wrong and helped them figure out how to steer clear of the worst and decide which others are worth the risk.TLDR Law school is definitely not a ticket to automatic wealth and success.  But if you can be nerdy about the right parts of the job it can be very rewarding.,gaybros,cnh3y4d,2,t5_2tdzg

Were actually the newest fraternity at my college we just got started last semester so that kind of helps. A lot of gay guys joined because we all liked the idea of being in a fraternity but most of the other ones on our campus are pretty stereotypical when it comes to how they treat gay guys. So we all kind of jumped on board for this seeing as how we get to be the founding members and we can set the standards for how we want things to go  We are located in the south so some groups and people on campus have been unsurprisingly judgmental and outspoken and we get a lot of shit for being a gay fraternity but we just ignore it and do our own thing. Its been great so far! And we have several straight guys too and theyve all been cool with it its been fun.

3159128,0,t3_2wa5x7,YES! Collecting records is more than a hobby for me its truly a passion. To me there are very few things that are more appealing than spending an afternoon sifting through stacks of vinyl looking for that one hidden gem in a used record shop. Theres something about the smell that I love its very similar to the smell of really old books. For me theres something about owning a physical copy of an album. I certainly love listening to music in other formats but there is an experience and process surrounding vinyl that I am enamored of cataloguing cleaning records maintaining a turntable setting up a speaker system holding the album cover in my hands etc. Its not as simple as just hitting play and I like that. I also love to think about who has owned these LPs before me and what they meant to those people because we all have a special and unique connection with music.Ive made some great friends through record collecting too. My favorite record shop PJs Records in Ann Arbor  gotta give them a shoutout! is owned by two brothers Mark and Jeff who seem to have never left HaightAshburys counterculture. While Mark Jeff and many of their friends are several decades older than I am I get along well with all of them. I spend hours talking about anything ranging from music to politics to sports with these guys and I consider them to be some of my best friends.My point is that record collecting can be a great and engaging hobby.Anyways heres my setup and collection currently around  LPs The turntable is a Rega P with a Rega Bias  cartridge and an upgraded belt drive. There is an NAD PP phono preamp not shown in photos. The receiver is noting special a lower end Pioneer VSXK but it gets the job done. The speakers are Paradigm Mini Monitors v.,gaybros,copfwn2,1,t5_2tdzg

I cant count the number of times someone has come up to me and a friend in the bar and ask if we are together or compliment us on being so cute together. My friends always laugh it off and I usually respond with an eye roll and no sorry just friends hes straight. Which then elicits an OMG Im so sorry I didnt mean anything I just assumed! You would make a great couple though! This is another one of my least favorite things about gay culture that people feel the need to go out of their way to compliment gay couples  I for one would never go up to random strangers and compliment their heterosexual relationship. ,gaybros,couhhvi,1,t5_2tdzg

I do have to say that from reading his Wikipedia I am intrigued at some of his ideas on manhood masculinity and homosexuals while some of his other personal thoughts later on in the entry just really arent for me White Nationalism. Misogyny isnt enough to ban an author. Bukowskis Women was pretty offensive to women yet hes considered a vaunted author. Banning books in general is a bad idea regardless of the content as the librarys duty is to provide information not deny information.

3270131,0,t1_cp10635,DARTMS is pretty cool but its not perfect. The reason that it isnt perfect is that your LCMS gives you two descriptors retention time and mass spectrum while the DARTMS can only give you one descriptor mass spectrum. Also DARTMS usually gives the MH or MH ions depending on if its in positive or negative ion mode. Other ions such as M are possible but you will never see the same degree of fragmentation as EI CI ESI or APCI. Depending on the application this may or may not be a problem but for forensics usage DARTMS will always be more of a presumptive test that would need to be confirmed by other analytical techniques.,gaybros,cp10sa8,5,t5_2tdzg

3473774,0,t3_2zzilu,Im really hoping that Looking gets renewed for a third season and possibly more. I feel like the characters and story are relatable even for those of us who dont live in big cities. There are lot of shows on TV which are much more cringeworthy that are or will be renewed yet people are looking at ratings for Looking and are forgetting that HBO is not NBCABCCBSFOX.The season finale is one episode which couldve easily been an hour long.  I feel that the PatrickKevin drama took up too much of the film though it couldve been even longer.  I dont think theyll break up but do feel that there needs to be a lot more discussion between the two before the relationship really works.  Will Patrick top Kevin against the double paned window while all the guys from the party watch?  Probably not though it might help Patricks self confidence.I think that Patrick wanting to stay and watch the supposed orgy was said sarcastically and am surprised the creators didnt mention that when they discussed the episode afterwards.I want to see Dom have a successful business for Augustin to settle down a bit and for Richie to find the love he deserves.  Itd be good for Lynn to return as well though Im not sure if the production schedule for NCIS New Orleans allows for it. ,gaybros,cpo8hxn,2,t5_2tdzg

3566193,0,t3_31021k,Hey I live between Livermore and Hayward. I grew up in the area so I know it well. If I had a internship in Livermore Id live in Dublin or Pleasanton close to the BART station then you could take BART to the city or wherever really at any time and be relatively close to work. Also Pleasanton and Dublin are pretty fun even though they are suburban nice downtown movie theater complex and tons of stores hiking malls wineries  ... a summer county fair. Traffic is bad I would never live in Emeryville or San Jose or Berkley  Oakland as you will have a hour commute each way and it wont be fun. Dublin  Pleasanton is a good area cheaper than if you go closer to SF expensive or sketchy... Id take a weekend trip and drive around for the best view. I attached a link to a map of BART and counties to see.  There is a driving range right by the Freeway near livermore. Most people use Grindr in the East Bay and dont party we are suburby we move here to be away from city scenes into nature and open spaces. You will find bars wine bars and beer halls all around. If you want gay head to the city there are tons of parties for a more chill scene try Berkeley gay college students or Oakland. Even Castro Valley has cheap rent and between Pleasanton and Hayward. Id buy a used bike on Craiglist and BART if I didnt have a car. Checkout rooms on Craigslist. Id research up on these sitesAlso join for events and cheapt stuffLiving Social SF Bay Area And Groupon SF Bay AreaYELP is your friend download it tons of restaurant and other suggestions.  ,gaybros,cpyrtj2,2,t5_2tdzg

I also cant even at bullshit like thisgt The people who are fucked are the ones who do it slavishly for looks and usually they dont manage to hold on that long.People who work out for aesthetics are more motivated to keep up their physique in the long term. Many athletes stop training when their seasoncareer is over because they have no need to and get out of shape.As to the article itself Davey Wavey is absolutely right in saying that you will never look like a personal trainer or a bodybuilder if your job is not being one. This is not a matter of Dont tell me what I can or cant be because you cant have a to job and a social life and still go the gym  times a day.

Oral and anal are still sodomy and will turn you to pillars of salt not literally.

4079312,0,t1_crl1tmb,Absolutely feel free to ask anything if I dont get to it. While Its not for everyone I found my fitness pal to be the key to my success. I like stats and numbers and once I figured out weight loss had math involved it made everything work for me. Even if tracking calories doesnt seem doable to you calculate your TDEE Total Daily Energy Expenditure which is the number of calories you can eat to maintain your current weight. Google TDEE and there are a bunch of calculators. Next there are  calories in a pound. So if you wanted to lose one pound a week youd eat  calories less than than your TDEE  x  days is  calories. I was amazed at how I could eliminate the mindless guessing of what I was eating and actually hold myself accountable. If youve already done all this my apologies!! Other key factors for me included Moderation of everything. I still eat burgers and fries at restaurants. I like Iced Capps too. Track everything I eat. Even if I have a bad day I track it all and it means I can stay honest.  Go slow. Make gradual changes. Over the course of time which will fly by these small changes compound and make a noticeable difference before you know it.  The hardest part is to start. It really is. Once you build momentum and a routine its simple. Smokers will say the same thing when quitting. That first week can be tough. The first month can be frustrating when you dont notice any change. But just stay committed and youll be amazed how quick changes will come.  Motivation is not the key discipline is the key. I kind of go by the philosophy that discipline is the key to success. Motivation fluctuates but discipline means youll do something regardless. For me I use motivation to take me from one level to another but discipline to make sure I get it done. For instance I know that I want to get a  minute bike ride in x a week. Discipline ensures that happens but if I have extra motivation it takes me from a  minute ride to an hour ride. Its the cherry on top. Any other questions? ,gaybros,crl9mix,4,t5_2tdzg

4150216,0,t3_37zvom,I have a very similar situation! I just moved in with my boyfriend of . years met in school dated since my sophomore year. We have a pretty big social circle and we have a lot of mutual friends but also friends of our own. We live in SF so the cut in rent is lovely but I personally would never choose to live with someone else just to cut down on rent. He works for an accounting firm so sometimes he will travel and be gone for  days at a time so its nice to have him around when I come home and he is in town D To be honest the biggest thing for me is sleeping together like in the same bed. I am  and tend to move around a lot so I will wake him up a lot and I will sometimes wake up myself. I also dont always like the way that people react when I tell them that we are living together mostly because we are young and just out of school but I am pretty much over that now. I also know that I am moving back to LA in about a year and that we will probably try to do long distance. We have just gotten to that point where we think years in advance which is exciting for me. If its an option I would recommend what one of the other commenters said about getting a place for the two of you not just his because I felt like that created some problems for us early on but now we are doing great. Also figure out how you are splitting up all the bills  dont let that create problems. In conclusion the decision can make sense for your relationship or it might not and you probably have the best grip on that. Dont rush into anything and consider why you are doing what you are doing  saving rent money isnt always the best reason you should be ready to commit to this new lifestyle. ,gaybros,crtc7ho,1,t5_2tdzg

4214336,0,t3_392aay,Rather than address any of the predictably asinine comments in this thread Im just going to share my own experiences as the OP asked.  I was obese as a child and as an adult Ive cycled between being both overweight and at the higher end of the normal weight range with the general weight trend being downward over time.  First Ill say that the individualization of obesity its solely about willpower self control laziness etc is both wrong in many cases and decreasingly accepted by medicalpublic health professionals.  For example I recently watched a documentary called Fed Up about childhood obesity in the US.  What I found most fascinating was how the parents thought they were making healthier choices for their kids but in reality they were just buying healthier processedjunk food.  They simply didnt have the knowledge about what constituted healthy food choices.  I was obese as a kid because I had little to no control over what I ate or the serving sizes I was offered.  Overeating and processedconvenience foods were normalized.  I was raised by a single mom for part of my childhood so we ate a lot of fast food.  Because I was very introverted and cerebral I was not drawn to sports.  It wasnt until I was in high school that I discovered yoga and became more active doing that.  Once I got to college and had more control over what I ate I had to learn what constituted a balanced diet.  I knew nothing about simple v. complex carbs glycemic index glycemic load different types of fats etc obviously you dont need to know all of this to eat lesshealthier but it helps when youre making the decision between Chipotle and Panera or deciding what to add to your Chipotle burrito bowl.  I went through a multiyear process of acquiring the nutritional knowledge that would inform better daytoday decisions about food and finding a balance between foods I would enjoy and that would be good for me.  I also had to learn my body actually pay attention to what made me feel energized and recognize physical cues around satiety for the first time.  Im still learning not to use food as a coping mechanism and really many of us do it to some degree regardless of our weight but first I had to realize I was doing it in the first place.  In addition I engaged in regular moderate exercise depending on how busy I was.  Eventually I was thinner but still overweight.  I had no health conditions as much physical stamina or more than my friends and stable energy levels but I was still overweight.I think the thing that shifted my perception around body image as a gay man was noticing the difference in attention I received from other men when Im at the lower end of my normal weight range.  Its kind of disheartening because  pounds isnt some drastic transformation for me its basically just the difference between being average and slightly overweight but it clearly changes how Im perceived in what seems like a fairly significant way.  Ultimately realizing this changed the way I view datingrelationships because if someones initial interest in me is solely about the superficial thats not even the most important part of compatibility.  Thats only what gets you through the gate in my opinion.  Sexual attraction obviously has a physical component.  Thats undeniable.  But what I dont understand is how rigid that is for some people.  The people for whom physical appeal doesnt take a range of forms suffer from a huge lack.  There are obese people Ive found attractive and not solely or even primarily for their weight and those Ive found unattractive.  The same goes for thin people.  I dont even find that Im primarily attracted to one over the other.  Plus appearance doesnt tell me how much Ill enjoy sex with someone.  That comes from how comfortable I feel around them and how connected we are.Anyway I continue to improve my diet and explore new ways of being fit not so I can lose weight to be attractive but so I can learn more about food and have different kinds of experiences in my body.  I still do yoga but Ive also added lifting to my repertoire which is an entirely different kind of physical experience.  And I like it because it makes me feel stronger.  Maybe Ill gain some muscle or lose some fat.  Maybe not.  Ive put a lot of work into being happy with my body and making it happy and thats more important than the work Ive put into just losing weight.,gaybros,cs0mai3,4,t5_2tdzg

Lito is in love with a guy but he is concerned about his career. This has lead him to become a proficient liar. Which is something I think that a few of us can relate to. Nomi however has to deal with the prejudices that still surround being transgender while having already accepted herself. Throughout the first season we see both characters grow and Lito come to terms with what he wants and who he is. I think its kind of beautiful.

However its not unimaginable that the most reluctant states will wait until lower courts officially order them to do so.Technically this opinion applies only to states under the Sixth Circuit Kentucky Michigan Ohio and Tennessee. It does establish a clear precedent however. That means lower courts across the nation will simply issue a summary judgement in favor of samesex marriage ordering the holdout states to immediately grant licenses to samesex couples.,gaybros,csjlq8k,3,t5_2tdzg

I think for some in my generation although not for me and I think for almost everyone older than me who came of age during the worst of the epidemic there is a degree to which they experience this in a way similar to the way Moses experienced the trip to the promised land they can see that we live in a world where homophobia doesnt exist in day to day life but the scars they bear and the wounds theyve experienced are such that they can never really feel it can never really experience it emotionally even if they know intellectually that its true.Thats got to be a profoundly wierd experience to win the victory ... but only for others not for yourself.,gaybros,csknrwn,3,t5_2tdzg

They will be marked by dishonor huge difference  they failed to properly raise and teach one of their own their communitys teachings etc.   Its easy to blame a book. Its not the book its the people. Its necessary to make the distinction because if you are going to try and convince these people where they are wrong you have to show them the difference.  Read the article againgtgtImam and Islamic scholar Dr Usama Hasan from the Quilliam Foundation says there are many hadiths and traditions ascribed to the Prophet Muhammad and his disciples on the subject of punishment for homosexuals. However all are disputed and there has never been any consensus on them especially since they seem to contradict the Koran . He adds that some scholars have argued that Muhammad could not have given any such ruling since no confirmed case of homosexuality was ever brought to him  People talk about how homosexuals should be dealt with in Muslim societies. Why cant they all agree on a manner of execution if they are all reading the same book? The Quran doesnt have multiple versions  just the one. Why is it that only ISIS and the Taleb who do this fanatical witch hunt? They punish their victims by raping them how does that make any sense? It is rather like how the Nazis persecuted the Jews and homosexuals  it en vogue and quite reactionary to current events. I have a feeling the more acceptance homosexuals gain in the west the more fanatic ISIS will become in showing how the west is wrong. They want to show the people wherever ISIS is the difference between themthe locals and the outsiders west a nebulous term in on it self. They are trying to perpetuate the idea of otherness and xenophobia about the western infidels,gaybros,cte045c,4,t5_2tdzg

5125699,0,t1_cv3twgs,I agree that there will probably be a social gathering every few days if not every day for LGBT people.  And I also agree that you might find the average age to be pretty old not all cruises but most... most cruises are for old people and their parents. With respect to GrindrSrcuff or other geo location apps dont bother with those.   Firstly getting Wifi access on board is stupidly expensive and nobody else does it.  Your cell service wont work because youre too far away from land.  And even if you DO get wifi your location is all messed up on cruse ships.  When Google drives around with street view cars theyre scanning for open Wifis.  When the spot one they mark the latitudelongitude of that wifi.  So when WiFi hotspots move they no longer have the correct location tagged to them.  I was on a Med cruise a gay cruise and we were ouside off the coast of Italy and my Grindr was saying I was in Florida which would have been where the hotspot happened to be tagged when google drove by. So if you want to flirt with guys that are really thousands of miles away but appear to be very close go ahead and fire up Grindr.  LOL sorry for the long and nerdy explanation...

Martin Shkrelis done it before with a formerly owned company he started Retrophin using a medicine for kidney failure. Another old drug Retrophin bought the rights to it and increased its price by x .gtBut wait theres more! There is so so much more.gtThat older company Retrophin? Shkreli doesnt own that anymore after he was kicked out by the board of directors and sued. They are alleging that he misused company assets to stave off other lawsuits. What other lawsuits? I mentioned that he was a hedge fund manager but it turns out he actually owned a hedge fund MSMB Capital that specialized in short selling biotech companies meaning hed get paid when theyd fail. Except it was MSMB Capital that failed and failed so spectacularly he was accused of defrauding his investors and threatened with a hail of legal action. As if thats not enough as far back as  there were calls for the SEC to investigate MSMB Financial due to claims that this guy actively disparaged the drugs of companies he was betting against in order to manipulate the market among other shenanigans. Since early this year it was disclosed that Shkreli is under an ongoing federal criminal investigation.gtSo just to rehash Shkreli may have manipulated markets to make money betting on failing biotech businesses with his hedge fund until it cratered so hard that he was threatened with lawsuits from investors so he made another company in the same offices  bought and marked up a  year old drug x and used the company assets to placate the original angry investors only to be ousted and sued by his own company for it then founded another pharmaceutical company that purchased another old drug and marked it up  drawing so much negative attention to himself that presidential candidates have already commented on it.This son of a bitch would be a bond villain if he wasnt so inept.,gaybros,cv9woyx,9,t5_2tdzg

But random citizens cant take personally motivated vengeance and then call it justice.  Maybe he really does deserve to die but you dont get to decide that.  Taking justice into your own hands is a slippery slope if people did that we would have anarchy.  TLDR We already have a system in place for making sure people who do bad things are punished.

For reference by  Illinois was the only state that had struck down sodomy laws it was illegal everywhere else.By  he was celebrating gay pride setting up a gay pride day when he was Mayor of Burlington.In  it appeared that he was against Dont ask dont tell when he defended gay soldiers in front of Congress after a Representative from California attacked those who voted for homos in the military.Yes in  he wanted civil unions in Vermont for gay couples instead of full marriage. However that in no way invalidates his past. Going from a CBS poll only  of Americans supported full gay marriage with  supporting civil unions and  against either. He did not want to completely divide a state. That does not make him any less of a champion for gay marriage.Sanders chief of staff explained that his DOMA vote was because of state rights. Slate seems to assume that that was his only reason and therefore he didnt support gay rights but that isnt even close to necessarily true. If I support getting rid of the federal ban on marijuana for both personal reasons supporting marijuana and for constitutional reasons believing it should be a state choice I would definitely mention the second reason over the first one when voting for a federal law in Congress.Meanwhile you didnt bring this up but I saw a few people saying that Bernie and Hillary were just a few years apart... below Hillary didnt support a change from mother and father to parents one and two on passports in  even though she had just said gay rights are human rights to the UN just before and didnt come out for gay marriage rights until .That said to say Bernie has been anything but for gay rights for a long time is completely dishonest.,gaybros,cw3srvy,8,t5_2tdzg

And what does it say in a world ruled by straight people. And where do gay acting people stand in that world? That is what bothers me. We all know not all straight people give their blessings  the fear of the unknown is what creates friction stigmas and the inability to accept others. By saying you are straight acting to me it says you have a fear of being associated with gay acting and thus in a way agree with the points of view of a small portion of people that will do anything in their power to opress the LGBTQIA community.

He advises people who come out even not about sexualityjust about personal lifestyles to their parents to give their parent a year.  Give them a year to fight kick scream rant and be a total toddler about you being the healthy mature adult individual that you are. Let them ask any questions they want and forgive them anything they say however hurtful. BUT ONLY GIVE THEM A YEAR. After that you are reinforcing their negative behavior. Trust me on thisI have seen it work time and time again. If you make your parents realize that your presence in their life is subject to their treating you with respect and respecting your life and if they cant do that to at least have the decency and maturity not to talk about it and pick a fight then you can develop a more healthy dynamic built on mutual respect.  Dont spend years letting her think that being super negative to you is the healthy right thing to do.

See rTotallyStraight NSFW. Internalized homophobia aside I can believe that this could be a real thing in some cases.We ignore how deeply ingrained sexuality is in our identities. Sexual orientation is intended to only describe your sexual behavior but both gay and straight people use it as a fundamental descriptor of who they are as a person. I think this is partly due to shortcomings in common English which fails to distinguish between sexual and romantic attraction. After all most people dont know that heteroromantic is even a word. Given the limited choice of descriptors in common use I think its fair that they label themselves straight.

6089149,0,t3_3yvj7e,I finished an  years old relationship a couple of months ago we saw everything through each others eyes we were beautifully bound we were together since we were both ... but then I went abroad and realised how naive  I had been thinking I was ready to spend the rest of my life with him... I experienced and saw many things that made me change a lot I went through many things and life was showing me something else... there were also temptations of course I had never experienced hookups or just seeing guys for brief moments even partying not that my ex was controlling me but for different reasons I never had the chance to do it and then our communication started failing miserably.Then one day he came to visit me  I didnt know he was coming  and my world shattered in front of me it was an incredibly dramatic moment when I saw him again after so long.. because at that point the situation of our relationship wasnt very clear and he was looking desperately for answers while my head was spinning around like crazy. I couldnt connect the dots of reality it was the clash of my past my present and my future a massive supernova of suffering tears and lots of revelations since he found out about many things Id done... he went to my night stand and found a box of condoms which he threw to my face out of frustration... he saw empty bottles of alcohol in my room I just drank when I was with some guys in my room sometimes and forgot to take them out I didnt have an alcohol problem but I suppose for him it seemed like that especially since he always hated alcohol and found out about many other things.. he had regretted to visit me to see what was happenning but I cried on my knees grabbed his legs and begged him not to leave  I was as destroyed as he was but in a different way  he just wanted to take his suitcase and leave. Finally I convinced him to stay but I didnt understand reality anymore and I didnt know what to do but my guilt was killing me... Anyway many things happened but I knew for certain that we were going anywhere together and then finally one of those days we had a huge fight I finally told him I didnt love him anymore. I broke his heart in one thousand pieces perhaps more he was devastated and I was dying inside because even though I wasnt able to continue our relationship for many reasons I still loved him  and even now but in a very different way I mean we lived many many difficult things together including the death of my parents lack of money academic stress family drama and we were always there for each other. Always.Now when I look back I realize we were too young we still needed to see other things first we werent meant to be.After breaking up we decided to keep in touch and help each other as much as we could. He had to go back home defeated depressed without knowing what to do and I stayed abroad going on with my shattered life trying to find a way being consummed by this horrible guilt for hurting the most precious person in my life. I wish I had never hurt him. ,gaybros,cyhrk4z,7,t5_2tdzg

Jussie Smollett is one of them. Im so glad hes out there. Hell I look up to him even though hes considerably younger than I am. Because that guy is a role model.

6650013,0,t1_d074l8t,Japanese gay men would disagree with you they simply arent interested in marriage as much. The western concept of gay as being an intrinsic sexuality is different than the Japanese paradigm of just being something that guys do. Its not considered a sin and they dont have a belief in an all seeing deity who can watch you have sex behind closed doors. Even in most of western culture except the past  years marriage has been simply for procreation. Love and sex were sought outside of that. Japanese society is still more similar to that than our western love marriage ideal.  of Japanese couples have a baby within their first year of marriage and  of children are born to married couples. In other words marriage  babies. Japanese gay men arent as interested in marriage as much because they know they arent going to get babies. You cant just go around judging cultures based on your assumptions and you cant assume other gay men want the same thing as you just because theyre gay. Japanese gay men are very different and actually tend to be straighter than Japanese straight men. Yes they want sex but anything else might have to be reconsidered.,gaybros,d0763a4,18,t5_2tdzg

6652116,0,t3_46ri5q,Hey! You remind me of myself the majority of my friends consist of guys who are pretty sporty. For as long as I can remember I struggled with my sexuality being teenagers you would hear how badly some of them talked about being gay.. I also used to see some fem guys who would get so badly bullied at my school so I thought if I just keep these feelings at bay then eventually I would not have them any more. So I did! But the feelings never went away and I started to hate myself more and more.. I just wanted to be normal. So fast forward a few years and Im in a foreign country getting my degree.. I found tindr at this point I decided to meet a guy.. Right then and their I knew. I was seriously on the down low though after finishing school.. I came back to my country. Continued on meeting guys I decided I wanted something more.. I would have to explain myself to everyone first though. So first of all I just sat down with my sister and brother in law we had some wine and then I just told them they needed to know something. I spat out the words Shaking at this point  they were so happy  . After that it was a pretty easy process. I only told close friends and family it doesnt have to be some massive announcement. The world doesnt have to know at once. Good thing is I havent lost a single friend. Youd be surprised!! Came out like  months ago. ,gaybros,d07dx24,2,t5_2tdzg

7165416,0,t3_4dl89d,my boyfriend and I met on OKC  we both came away from our first date thinking the other was okay but there wasnt a whole lot of mutual interest.he ended up getting back in touch a month later and was like want to see eachother again and just see where it goes? I figured yeah why not... and where it went was like four or five hours of the best sex Id had in years. I had forgotten how much fun it was to bottom.we got back together a few more times until I asked where we were going with this  hes poly and had a primary at the time  and we settled on actually officially dating as opposed to just being friends with benefits or hooking up... then he started to kinda fall in love with me and then I started to kinda fall in love with him and pretty soon I was the primary and then there werent any secondaries just the two of us.we kept our relationship open though it seems like hes settling into being pretty monogamish which is really my preferred arrangement. we both meet people were curious about occasionally and hes a bit more sexually driven than I am so when Im unavailable its nice for him to go out and get laid without feeling guilty about it. its a very if you love someone set them free and if they love you theyll stay kind of an approach from my perspective.,gaybros,d1sn12k,4,t5_2tdzg

In a straight couple theres always this looming image of the girl who does all the cooking and cleaning and the guy who does all the fixing and heavy lifting and Ive seen it cause a lot of tension when their actual skills and personalities clash with the expectation. Two guys living together are pretty much making it up as they go along so its much easier to share responsibilities and strike a balance.The role thing extends beyond just responsibilities too. On crappy days when I just want a hug Ive always felt really comfortable laying next to a guy and wrapping his arm around me. But then the next day I can turn around and be the one supporting him. Straight couples can obviously grow this dynamic too and I think many of the healthy relationships that end up lasting do but theyre constantly fighting against the stereotypes being shoved down their throat in every movie book and tabloid magazine.,gaybros,d2e61cb,44,t5_2tdzg

Many openly gay people have more accepting straight friends now than theyve ever had before and can now freely participate in more societal mainstream things than ever before too so there is less and less need for being corralled into gay only safe havens. To many the whole point of gay equal rights is just equal rights not to have those equal rights but remain separate from the rest of society. Those who started the whole equal rights for gays movement should have had the foresight to see this coming. Gay is not a club or a cult like many seem to act like it is.

He doesnt have to talk about hookups which he still does a lot of in his podcast and book to be a positive influence to gays.

While I cannot claim to represent all gay Arabs or the gay Arab experience because there isnt just one sometimes I do feel like being a gay Arab is a contradiction of sorts. I feel like I am caught between my culture and sexuality as if being one conflicts with being the other. I am not Muslim so I can only imagine what throwing that into the mix can do to ones sense of self.The Orlando massacre really got to me as a gay man and a human. It is just horrifying. In its aftermath now there is renewed discussion on homophobia and Islamophobia in the U.S. Clearly these conversations should be happening. For anyone who happens to be a gay Arab gay Muslim or all three they will likely find themselves in the middle again. They will likely be called faggot from one side and a terrorist from the other all while probably just trying to mourn the victims and the loss to our LGBT community.On a lighter note I just got to see Mashrou Leila live for the first time a couple of weeks ago while they are on tour here in the U.S. They put on a great show and the band members were all so fn dreamy.,gaybros,d4b4ym4,11,t5_2tdzg

8004810,0,t1_d4c5m9c,Ive read that the gay uncle hypothesis doesnt have that much support. Instead what Ive read is that homosexuality in males is a by product of reproductive advantage women have.It has been noted that the female relatives of gay men have more children than female relatives of straight men. This gave rise to the idea that something which increases the chances of homosexuality is passed on the Xchromosome which all men get from their mother and share only with the mothers side of the family. And this same allele also makes the women carrying it more fertile having more children.A continual study for this looked on how these female relatives from the mothers side of gay men were like. It was found out they are more promiscuous have more marriages divorces sexual partners which leads to having more children. The researchers speculated that the sexuality of these women was boosted by something in the Xchromosome and as a side effect it increases the chances their sons are gay. But as the heightened sexuality gives greater reproductive benefit to the species than having gay sons diminishes the allele remains in the population. Like a family without this gay allele would have  babies in  generations but  gay males and a family with this gay allele would have  babies and  gay males in  generations. Even with the gays the family with the allele has more babies and the females pass this allele to their daughters who get evolutionary benefit from it and to their sons who as a side effect maybe dont mate with females.,gaybros,d4fteb3,1,t5_2tdzg

So why are we the only community that is being essentially banned from saving lives? Gay men have a significantly higher rate of new HIV infections compared to the general population and yet only represent a small  of the population. By eliminated gay men from donating you eliminate significant HIV risk. gt Technology exists today and has actually existed since the s to test for HIVAIDS in blood so why is it necessary for this ban? When the blood is tested it is tested in a big batch. If there is one bag of infected blood in that batch the entire batch has to be thrown out. It is also very difficult to test for new infections and gay men account for a huge  of new infections see the above linkgt Why are we as a collective not seemingly showing an active interest of changing this legislation?Because most gay men realize this is not about a fight for equality and just a matter of good public health administration and statistics. Gay men are not the only ones who cannot donate due to statistics.

The fact that politics and gay money and LGBT rights go hand in hand doesnt mean that issues that effect all LGBT people of color like finances shouldnt also be top priority.Ive never seen the Human Rights Campaign at a black high school just talking about college education. Instead theyre talking about HIV prevention if that. Ive only seen HRC interact most with the Latino community but not Latino youths. Its like HispanicLatino Men and Black men are the ones with HIV and thats what the nonprofit landscape looks like without trying to help solve the problems that get HispanicLatino Men and Black Men to that point anyway which is income inequality and education inequality.Which is WHY I WAS DISGUSTED that the Human Rights Campaign was showcasing Vote Hillary propoganda at the Pride event I attended.The Clintons havent done much for this LGBT people of color and to ask for their votes and continue to do nothing is a shame.

8146682,0,t1_d4vsjfb,Ive heard a lot of sports fans say Im going to kill X person.  Again Im going to think about these statements within context not one that means to incite dispute.  This will be my last argument about this What Im saying is that there is a clear misrepresentation about what the goals of the BLM movement are supposed to be.  If you choose to value these threats which I acknowledge that they are and sidestepping the orientation of what the larger goal is then go right ahead.  I would only ask that you acknowledge that the organized movement is trying to bring attention to a larger systemic problem.  If we become tangled in what these spectacles then neither side is going to get any work done and the media just gets more aimless viewers.,gaybros,d4vvrcv,2,t5_2tdzg
8160042,1,t3_4r0hqa,I was going to say that if you want video games go to rgaymers but most of the content there is fan artrule  irrelevant discussions and begging for friends to play with. gtHas it sorta deviated from that? Are gay men by large not interested in football or wrestling unless its about how hot JJ Watt or John Cena is? Or about video games unless its about LGBT in gaming?The answer to that should be obvious. The only reason there would be a gay subreddit for those topics is because they want to talk about the gay stuff. Is that really a shocker? If I want real video games discussion I go to rGames  if I wanted to have real sports discussion I would go to that sports respective subreddit. If I want to talk about how hot a videogame character is or a sportsball player is Ill go to rgaymers and rgaybros.And just to add on a little note to the end You have to consider that what you think of as masculine behaviour is different to what someone else thinks is masculine behaviour.,gaybros,d4xjxg0,3,t5_2tdzg

8160088,0,t1_d4xdv30,gt  of guys are straight so statistically if you develop a crush on a guy from schoolworkwherever he will be straightThis is really it right here. Also why the gay community  clubs  etc is a thing. No matter where you work there will be very few gay people  so the chances things will click are low. Youll be around someone straight and you just fall for them. Kinda like developing feelings for someone whos married or in a long term relationship. You know theyll never reciprocate but you cant control your feelings. gt the average straight guys is more masculine while the average gay guy is more feminine. Gay guys overwhelmingly prefer masculineactinglooking guysEh maybe. Its changing recently but gay culture has been a turn off for many. Thats why I originally came to this subreddit.

8302858,0,t1_d5feml7,I dont think normalization is the issue its more a matter of people feeling entitled to whats a relatively personal part of someone elses life. There should be a stigma about asking a complete stranger because unless youre planning on asking them out then its really not relevant to the conversation. If youre getting to know them and they bring it up no biggie. If youve known them for a while then I dont think asking is a huge deal. I think its still a pretty intimate part of most peoples lives and its inappropriate in a lot of contexts  for example workplaces. I work at a school and its not something I want being circulated by teachers or students who I dont know because it would undermine my authority due to a really shit attitude about the tie between homosexuality and femininity and submissiveness and incapability to exert authority as a result of that tie and sexist attitudes. And I cannot possibly imagine a context in which asking a relative couldnt be awkward. The problem is that people assume the answer is either yes or no and therefore definitive. In reality aside from not being a yes or no answer in a lot of instances it also forces a lot of people who are in the closet to lie about it which always made me feel guilty and there was always a lot of panic about perhaps not being convincing enough in my responses. I think people should be careful who they ask and in what context. Its not an easy question to answer for a lot of people and it can drag up a lot of emotion for some people. Not trying to advocate for oversensitivity in that no one should ever ask but it should be handled delicately and the way people go about it with celebrities i.e. Bieber is crude obnoxious and inappropriate like most of the way people act towards celebrities in regards to their personal and private lives.,gaybros,d5fey6c,1,t5_2tdzg

There seems to be drug abuse estranged father multiple beatings taking place over the course of a lifetime. Brokeback mountain depicted the struggle of two men in love with each other.

What happened to accepting your sexuality on your own terms? Most gay people are scared of coming out its a reality and its not by shaming people who take too long to come out of the closet that youll help them accept who they are. Imagine if he had come out in his teens do you think that theres no discrimination and that his career path would be the same?Obviously not we all know discrimination and we all have to at least recognize that theres a whole process to coming out wether its through social media to millions of fans or just to that close friend while hanging out.,gaybros,d743fvs,6,t5_2tdzg

Both cities are hr away by train tickets are affordable for once each one has a couple of interesting museums to see and it feels so great to be in a humansize city where you can simply walk to places through stunning narrow streets and just chill on some fresh green grass. Some interesting Downtown Abbeylike castles can be visited from Oxford...I preferred Oxford but Cambridge could be more romantic the punting tours are bigger.Then I dont really know what to recommend in London not knowing your tastes but Camden Towns market is quite unique and the canals are pretty nice. Shoreditch is very hypehipster lot of good thrift shops... I renewed my entire wardrobe there.Museums The Tate Modern opened a new extension recently. I really like the National Portrait gallery especially the Tudor portraits I loved the fashion and the ugly pale faces each portraits could illustrate a fancy card set and the Tate Britain because it spans accros several centuries of paintings in one single museum and its not too big. The British Museum has impressive monumental displays.

Do you think any of the k a year staffers at the BBC The Guardian or FilmUK are fawning monarchists? Having a soft spot for the queen is less elitist its the most workingclass position one could take.It is undemoctatic yes. It does bring in more tourists. I live near Sandringham. How much tourism does the German Chancellors summer residence bring to the surrounding area.But the best thing about the monarchy is that mil is spent and must be spent where possible in the UK on employment and craft and investment in heritage. The French Art Council pays almost as much as that on just the Ballet de lOpra can you imagine something more... elitist?

Its been about  years since I lived there though so apologies if anything I say ends up being inaccurate.Its definitely a college town so a lot of what there is to do is centered around college students or night life on The Strip or downtown. The only real gay bar is Icon but a lot of other bars are at least gayfriendly if you avoid the frattierlooking ones... I think my friends like to hang out at places like the Druid City Brewing Company the Downtown Pub Egans or The Green Bar but locals can probably do a better job of recommending places to go. There are lots of historic sites and museums if youre into that and sportswise the University of Alabama has tons of different teams whose games you can go to. There are sometimes decent cultural events in town like art festivals theatrical productions at the Bama Theater or on campus movies food festivals... you may wanna check out the Visit Tuscaloosa website  for their event calendar to see whats going on while youre there.If youre there for a few weeks and will have a rental car Id recommend taking the hour drive to Birmingham sometime.

The HIV guy that spread the virus to the negative guy on PrEP was on meds to suppress the virus but he was just on them and didnt have a undetectable viral load. Most importantly PrEP forces people to get HIV testing every  months. A lot of people on PrEP wont use condoms and never will. If they are unfortunate to get HIV while on PrEP it will be picked up quickly by a test and they will be put on meds to surpress it. You are preventing most HIV strains and stopping newly positive people from spreading it. ,gaybros,d9131hk,5,t5_2tdzg

You are so young and have so much time for relationships and mistakes and you dont have to compare yourself to others especially those in straight relationships.Someone once said advice is just asking someone to tell you what you already know. You seem really smart and selfaware but if youre serious about taking advice here it is actually put yourself out there. You dont put yourself out at all. Look at your schedule its all about youself. Bettering yourself through learning coding working and the gym which is great of course but you wont meet your soulmate while youve got headphones in and youre totally zoned out on the weight bench or treadmill. Do you ever think to ask out another dude while youre at the gym? Probably not. And the other gay men there probably dont either. Or playing video games at lunch... by yourself. Or spending time with your pets at home alone by yourself. Youve gotta talk to people to start new relationships romantic or otherwise. Invite a coworker out to lunch and ask if they know anything about the gay scene or have a friend who might know.You say you arent in the scene and I understand its not for everyone but if you arent in it at all how do you ever expect to meet another gay man? If youre in a bigger city check out the gay bars theres lots of different kinds of gay bars gay intramural sports gay video game clubs whatever. If youre in a small town most colleges or communities have gay groups pride events drag shows something. Its not segregation well it is but its a way to find potential mates or even just friends who share common interests. And if all you do is go to the gym play video games work code and hike with the same group every year you arent extending your social circle for either friends or relationships which sounds like it needs to happen if you want to meet new people.,gaybros,db8oxfj,4,t5_2tdzg

10045768,0,t3_5jk5xx,No hard and fast rules other than they have to be an adult.  I will say how seriously I consider the odds of things being successful varies inversely with the difference in age.Im s my body is ss depending on where you focus my music taste is s and my political ideals are s.  I typically find younger guys more attractive physically but hotness comes in a lot of ways other than physical beauty.  So I guess maybe the level I connect with someone on influences whether the age feels like a match or not.To me dating someone near my age provides an unspoken commonality on many things and feels very warm and comfortable.  Dating someone outside my age group or background provides more of the dynamic found in a mixed gender relationship where there are areas of thinking and living we have to talk through and understand in each other and that can be quite interesting.  I cant say one is better than the other  everyone is so unique for me its difficult to generalize by age.,gaybros,dbgzmhv,3,t5_2tdzg

10055905,0,t1_dbh88aq,gt And then there is the curious fact that between the last two sections they seem to have completely dropped contact for more than a decade which is just glossed over. Thats the lingering question I have leaving the book is why that contact withered when it once was so fervent. Was it due to lifes tug and pull of demands and responsibilities eating into available time or was it something more deliberate that to carve a life for herself what was required was to weaken that bond. In the end she writes as if the bonds intensity never really ebbs so it makes you wonder. gtShe shows her relationship to Robert in an almost sanctified light.Aside from Robert that was true of her relationship with most of the characters in the book. Theres a remarkable lack of bitterness and a concentration on the most positive aspect of what she got out of the relationship a gratefulness of having had it. Perhaps this plays into her demureness she could care but focused instead of the optimistic aspect. Still not sure if its an incomplete picture or its a byproduct of who she is. I hadnt know who Patti Smith was going into this. I like her but at the same time find her unremarkable dropped in a remarkable setting. ,gaybros,dbib4l7,2,t5_2tdzg

This time is all about family and a lot of us have complicated relationships with our families because of the threat of losing them associated with coming out.

10612347,0,t1_dd92suo,Thats not a lie. The ban applies only to Muslims it suspends people coming in from majority Muslim countries but it makes exceptions for religious minorities which means only Muslims are banned so it would seem to me its perfectly accurate to describe it as a Muslim ban. The term is not inaccurate. Its perfectly legitimate for you to object to use of the term because you think its biased because it doesnt ban all Muslims and because it doesnt mention that its temporary. But you cant say the term is inaccurate. In the same article that describes the ban the writers perfectly described what the ban is it makes it perfectly clear that it applies to seven countries makes exceptions for religious minorities etc. The reader has enough information and access to actual facts to determine whether they agree with the term Muslim ban. So I dont buy your argument that this is a case of a lie in the New York Times. Your problem seems to be that the article did not frame the ban favorably which Ill you that one.

No gay player has bitten though.Dont forget hockey has a very sad tale about a gay player named Peter Karlsson he was killed by a neonazi because he was gay. The nazi got only  years.

From my perspective I can honestly say that Montreal falls in the top  cities to be gay in the world the others being Tel Aviv and San Francisco but thats how I see it.

It didnt help by the fact that French culture while pretty liberal by world standards is still quite conservative in some aspects especially societys stance towards gay rights despite having some of the best progay laws in the world. When I arrived in Montreal I was amazed by how much people couldnt care less of your sexual orientation at parties even straight guys arent too uncomfortable by the idea of kissing another guy while being drunk something that I never saw happen in France. At the same time I arrived I was slowly coming to the realization that I might have a thing for guys since I never held any sexual attractions towards women. Coming here made it possible for me to find more about myself than I ever would back in Nice and I dont know what the outcome would have been like if I chose to study elsewhere. All of a sudden I could finally live out the life I was destined for without the fear of being judging me here it is generally agreed especially on campus that whoever has a problem with that is either an asshole or a selfhating closeted guy who hasnt come to terms with himself yet.If you had any doubts about being gay in Montreal or in myyour case at McGill then hopefully this might help you forget about them ,gaybros,dde61vq,1,t5_2tdzg
10650471,0,t1_ddeg5dc,The coin flip is fine... in a turn based game like football someone has to start first. The problem is that theres no chance for rebuttal if its a touchdown thats scored on the opening drive. Im also not a fan of there being a kickoff for OT especially under the current rules set.In a perfect world both teams would get one guaranteed possession with the ball at their own  yard line. Make them go all the way down the field to score. If they do the other team gets the ball at their own  to start their rebuttal drive. Essentially it would be college OT rules but make them start their drive further in their own field. It gives the defense a way to effectively end the game before the offense takes the field by causing a safety which is extremely rare. ,gaybros,ddeiii8,1,t5_2tdzg

From his cabin he starts reflecting on societal norms what does it mean to be a man? His views helped me see that everybody is just trying to figure out who they are.

11210707,0,t3_5zpqn2,I dont generally keep contact with guys I dated but Im not much of a relationship guy in general so its not like Ive had a bunch of long term close relationships. However my roommate remained friends with his former boyfriend of two years. I think my roommate was the one who officially ended it but it was fairly mutual. His ex didnt have a ton of friends and ended up being really well liked by me and the rest of our friend group and my roommate really enjoyed spending time with him  it was just that there was no real romance any more. So with all that in mind they decided to really work to stay friends. They didnt talk for a few months and then slowly started texting and hanging out then hanging out with me. Then my other friends would invite him out and slowly but surely everyone got over the weirdness of it. We also all understood that if it got too weird for my roommate we would respect that. Now the ex is a really good friend of ours and we all hang out regularly and were all really happy they were able to preserve a friendship. Theyve both introduced guys theyve dated but so far neither has had a serious relationship which my roommate said will be weird  but well cross that bridge when we get there. In a nutshell I think the things that made it successful werea breakup that wasnt acrimonious a real desire not just from the couple but the friend group to try and preserve what did work in the relationshiptime off to allow for emotional processinga slow reintroduction almost dating all over again as friendsinclusion from the friend group so it didnt all fall on my roommate HONESTY from everyone at all times,gaybros,df2pyrs,2,t5_2tdzg

11378788,0,t1_dflr5mi,I guess Im maybe a little sensitive to portrayals of gay characters and especially gay men because thats what I am so whats simply a subplot in a broader story can affect how I perceive the show as a whole.I dunno I just feel like youd never see a story about a gay guy forcing his way into a straight relationship like that and if there was such a story no way theyd let the gay character off the hook so easily. And then this show gets a lot of press specifically because of its LGBT themes and characters. I realize its doing some really good things for representation across the LGBT spectrum but to me this subplot isnt one of them. And the article I linked to discusses a similar story line on the show involving a lesbian character. Im probably just being paranoid but I hope viewers dont think lesbian or gay male relationships need to be tested or improved via an oppositesex partner. ,gaybros,dflrltx,2,t5_2tdzg

I mean I love that kind of shit.I definitely dont look to television to present social norms i.e. to teach people about gay relationships about how to be a good lesbian or about politically correct queer behaviour. If I had even a whiff of that I would switch off.The Nomi character is interesting but it is close to getting a little too unbelievable and preachy when it comes to her.

11756536,0,t3_67r3gw,Pretty much the same but I cared a lot more about what people thought of me in regards to more than just my sexuality which made taking advantage of me a lot easier for people. Oh and I dated lots of girls and feigned interest in them which caused a lot of anxiety.I will never forget there was this girl at my high school who shall remain nameless and she was a well known slut who literally fucked everybody she could get her hands on. Well for a few months she was after me and all my friends were egging her on and trying to get me and her to hook up. So one day I was hanging out at the movie theater and one of my friends hears that she was there looking for me so she could find me and suck my dick. I tried to say I wasnt into her but nobody would listen and I didnt want to put up too big of a fight since I wanted everybody to think I was straight and straight guys like it when girls even slutty whores suck their dicks right? sSo anyway she eventually catches up to my crew and I walk around the side of a building and let her start doing her thing. But you guys it was seriously like  degrees out and on top of that I wasnt into her at all so of course I had severe shrinkage and nothing happened except for an exacerbation of my STD phobia and a lot of guilt and insecurity and shame.Wow now that I think about it I guess you could say I was raped a little bit that night. Raped not only by her but her in collusion with all my friends. I mean I didnt protest but the reason I couldnt was absolutely due to the intense social pressure. Then to top it all off one of my friends at the time later heard I couldnt get it up and started routinely making fun of me for not being into it like any straight guy would. I remember clearly my friends all laughing along to his remark that any normal guy would get hard from a girl giving them head. Then she kept stalking me driving by my house and speeding off and because I was still closeted it was hard to say leave me alone or tell my friends I wasnt interested. Im sure she had her own emotional problems and I think she is probably a better person now but holy fuck what a train wreck of a whore and I dont use such words on women lightly she was for a  year old girl I am telling you.Good times. Oh well. Life is much much better now Im  I have the full acceptance of my peers and parents and just a week ago started dating the cutest sweetest guy Ive ever met. Couldnt be happier.,gaybros,dgsmss5,11,t5_2tdzg

11765313,0,t1_dgtd9ur,rgaybros when I joined several years ago was at least implicitly a sub for masc gay guys who felt alianated from other parts of the gay community. Its morphed a bit over the years but is still definitely for gay men to discuss shared interests that are broy. The sidebar explicitly mentions media so Id say this fits that.A common theme discussed on this sub is fitting in at work and  coming out at school and work while remaining true to myself and my self identity is definitely something I struggled with when I came out. I remember a thread a while ago about jobs and there were a few guys working in mediaproduction and I know fitting in to both gay and straight spaces is a common theme on this sub so I thought this was a good thing to share here.I use a variety of terms in my post because the group Im building already includes people who are not cisgender men and at least a few of whom explicitly identify as queer.
