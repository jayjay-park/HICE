What you suggest is all cool for people who have discipline already obviously I do have problems with discipline otherwise I wont be asking this question it was completely unnecessary to rub it into my face accompanied with some Productivity  advises. I want Memrise to help me increase my productivity because I like to learn new stuff watering is not so exiting.,memrise,cil6e7g,-4,t5_2t1bu
1422799,0,t3_2afk8e,Hi cosOlivia from Memrise here.Thanks for reaching out through twitter. It looks like Ill have to consult with the tech team about Problems  and  looks like there might be a bug crawling around in there.Regarding your original question to enabledisable strict typing you have to go to your Database page you can access it from your Edit Course page. Once there click on the name of the column you want to edit and in the popup window select the Testing tab. Youll be able to adjust the strict typing option there.And about your Problem  it sounds like you are in the feedback page rather than the Knowledge Base. Is this what you are seeing? Knowledge Base When you perform a search you should see articles first and then ideas. If you only see ideas there might not be any articles to answer your question.You can also contact support by clicking on the question mark icon at the bottomright of the screen in the website. The widget will first try to locate KB articles to answer your query and if it finds none it will give you the option to send us a message. Hope this is helpful!,memrise,ciumixq,6,t5_2t1bu
