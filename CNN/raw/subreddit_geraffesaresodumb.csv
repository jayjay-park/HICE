2626352,0,t1_cn1dji5,Pizzazz!! How are you? Oh I posted it in epicthreadgtIll make a long story short.gtI was outside with my brothers talking the dogs out when a taxi cab driver pulls up asking for directions. I oblige him for a minute and tell him where to head. gtRight as we finish up my dog makes his way towards the driver side looking for me. At that moment I hear my brother yell to the top of his lungs stop! Here Im confused and telling the taxi cab to stop. gtIn a matter or a second I see my dog laying on the ground in excruciating pain and Im panicking and trying to help him. At first glance I thought he had been run over  I was filled with rage and sadness. However once we drove him to the vet he calmed down.gtThe vet told us that he just has a minor fracture to his leg and that his ligaments were damaged. He believes that in the moment of the taxi turning my dog tried to run out of the way and in that moment he was pushed. With the contact he jerked and damaged his ligaments and his bone fractured due to the strain.gtWe were extremely guilty.gtI am to blame and I feel absolutely horrible about it.The thing is we usually take out the dogs in the front without their leashes. Weve been doing that for years and nothing ever came of it until the other day.I blame myself for not being more cautious for not picking him up before talking to the taxi cab driver for not telling the taxi cab driver to hold on a sec to make sure he was not near the cab to not take him out with the leash to not be so careless and comfortable. I love my dogs so much and I failed him.I feel horrible about it.,geraffesaresodumb,cn1efcg,7,t5_2vjsb
