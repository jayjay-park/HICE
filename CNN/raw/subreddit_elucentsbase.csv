5426322,0,t3_3pahhp,Sorry but this pack is not running well...something is causing tps to be hit in unloaded dims. Weird world gen in those dims too....so were rebuilding a pack that may or may not have some of the original content. Edit Have a completed mod list. Has the core of your pack but we have had to shed Space Atum and Randon Things to limit the number of dimensions. I would prefer stability over variety at this point. Will be putting it together tonight and checking through configs tomorrow....should be launched sometime tomorrow afternoon. Will post a link here with the updated pack details. ,elucentsbase,cw59os4,1,t5_387lh
