Basically this is the exact same scam which is being talked about on the main sub which KKD has seen and has now commented here saying to be careful despite the fact that this scam has already taken place and was the one which triggered him to come here and say to be careful.So I think Shizumis comment was more of a sarcastic one based on this information.,SIFTrades,cpuwxvt,1,t5_33sbz

But so far none of the gaming stores Ive found sell the game at all.Well if the promo came from a movie the person who paid also got to see the movie and get the signed whateveritscalled.
