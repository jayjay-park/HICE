7066162,0,t3_4cdxen,Best of luck with your presentation. I witnessed a guy named Juan Carlos evade my Ragnars Bolter overwatch with the same squad member two turns back to back. The next turn he moved his hero to my blind side amp somehow it triggered overwatch as if I was facing a different direction.  Strange days are upon us.,WH40kSpaceWolf,d1hb8ky,2,t5_3bkku

7102984,0,t1_d1lh9vq, Thans  i actually want to see the probabilities with your teammates  i wonder if its possible to manipulate them also  Edit  too implied the wrong meaning     Here is a simple probability calc of the sprints     P         .        Roughly .    For only drawing  of the initial cards as a sprint and then drawing each successively on the turn they were used.     Initial draw chance for  run card   .       Draw chance for second card       Draw chance for rd card.    ... cards left     ,WH40kSpaceWolf,d1lhv5j,1,t5_3bkku
7791194,0,t1_d3ocw61,Terminator is fun but without upgraded teleports its nearly impossible to compete at the top level like playing scout without double wolves.,WH40kSpaceWolf,d3rsco9,2,t5_3bkku
7965347,0,t1_d4bd2ax,True. I only got bots for two days now. Easy grind for a change.,WH40kSpaceWolf,d4bdpsc,3,t5_3bkku
8150903,0,t3_4qv5u6,By the way does anyone know if the cards currently on offer will become available for forging as well?,WH40kSpaceWolf,d4wesgi,2,t5_3bkku
9381739,0,t3_57ning,I finished comfortably today. Got partially lucky. I missed a swing that would have ended a wave but resulted in a stunned cultist taking up effort. This allowed for an easy wave  after taking time to setup my troops. Wave  amp  had no commander and lots of hulks.Also I made a few moves and attacks that where not the best available. All my squad was there at start of wave  but only I finished. So I think with the deck I have survival while harder is still easy.,WH40kSpaceWolf,d957a8b,2,t5_3bkku
9608586,0,t1_d9w2qsm,Because old Itchinesu has the intellectual capacity of an onion. He has a long history of accusing people who beat him of cheating because he just cant bring himself to believe that he isnt the best at everything all the time. Its probably best to just ignore him.,WH40kSpaceWolf,d9xgdia,1,t5_3bkku

10139480,0,t3_5kfuid,The scout has with its abilities way too many low cards. With movement and wolf skill this allows  cards with  or less effort if used. They also can cycle through cards better than other classes with wolf skill and the Wolves effort adding ability.Today I played my first PvP game with scout. I made at least  big positional mistakes and still manage to get in a position where the opponent in his power armour quit.,WH40kSpaceWolf,dbt6fvr,2,t5_3bkku
10455010,0,t3_5pmpot,Im looking forward to the Ray review. He is one of my favorite squadmates in PvP.,WH40kSpaceWolf,dct6hlh,2,t5_3bkku
