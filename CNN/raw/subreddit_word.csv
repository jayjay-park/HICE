3905112,0,t3_355l3z,You didnt mention where you are copying from but generally speaking yes.EDIT Did a bit more research and its actually easier than I thought. Paste Special allows you to paste several different ways one of which is unformatted text without images.  If thats not what you mean send me a PM and Ill see if I can help.,word,cr1f0qq,1,t5_2qitx
