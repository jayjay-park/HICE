2672229,0,t1_cn71av0,I havent looked into it too much. Mainly because Ive been migrating all our websites from svn to gitgitlab and creating each of their own chef recipes. Ive finished that stage and have everything workingdeploying through opsworks so the next step of my plan is getting our debs working locally. The devs currently work on my dev git server it has a postreceive hook when they commit to the dev branch so they can see it on dev.website.com then when its ready to go live they create a merge request through gitlab..I approve it and deploy through opsworks.Do you know if its possible to create a virtualbox running docker as their local dev environment then use the same docker file to my opsworks instances? My only concern from my understanding of docker is that instead of deploying a few updates files in a website branch to opsworks Id now be redeploying a whole servercontainer using docker. That sounds like overkill and more time consuming for small updates.,vagrant,cn7dsu6,1,t5_2utou

We have no clue what tutorial or guide you are referring to or where youve gotten your configuration from.  Please post your vagrantfile if you want additional help.,vagrant,cyvsqgm,5,t5_2utou
