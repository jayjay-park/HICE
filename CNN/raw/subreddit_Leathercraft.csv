905510,0,t1_ch6a5fs,Most of what I do is vegtan so I can dye and finish it whatever way I choose. It adds time over buying finished leathers but for some things its worth it. I always have   and  on hand for bags and wallets  amp  for belts and straps and theres some skirting floating around for the really heavy stuff.  hides each and I usually keep it stocked. Finished leathers are more of a per project or per sale basis. A friend wanted saddlebags for his bike so I got several sides made his bags and  other sets and a bunch of crap out of the scraps till it was gone. A while ago Springfield had a sale on brown suede for  a side. Not great leather and I didnt have much need for it at the time but I still bought  of them. It pushed me to develop new ideas of how to use it up. Basically at some point if youre having fun and producing a lot youll start to approach this hobby more like a business its kinda inevitable after youve given people leather for the rd Christmas in a row. Always have materials on hand to make what you want and figure out a way to make something out of whatever you have. ,Leathercraft,ch77n55,1,t5_2sufa

Cut the design out of the card stock like you would with the leather trace pieces onto leather cut the leather and you are good to go.I mostly make sheaths so I rarely need anything too big to be cut out of a single sheet of card stock but if I did I think I would just line up the two pieces as I went to trace the design onto the leather or if that became a problem tape the sheets of card stock together.,Leathercraft,cigreyh,2,t5_2sufa

I circled where I felt it wasnt necessary to have  layers. Id consider playing around with the the interior pocket design to reduce bulk and the varying edge thicknesses. Your design doesnt quite allow a proper t pocket design but I tried to introduce elements of it in my comments pocket design changes that should allow for the same functionality while making your edges more even thicknessthus easier to burnishfinish! which should make it more visually appealingpeople like symmetry.

3796107,0,t3_33wcnw,Hi Reddit LeatherpeopleSo this is the latest wallet I built.  The client wanted a natural vegtan wallet with blue Ritza Tiger thread which in retrospect means every single mistake or blemish I make will show.  He opted for three card slots and a cash slot.It goes without saying that this was the most frustrating build Ive done so far.The construction part went quite well.  I used oz Hermann Oak vegtan leather and proceeded with construction the same way I always have.  One catch though...THIS TIME...was the first REAL time I was using proper pricking irons and an awl to make my holes this was a big change from my previous method using stiching chisels.  This resulted in my stitches on the opposing side traveling a LOT and was very frustrating.  I pulled the back piece off twice before finally settling.My solution to get over the hump was to punch each piece through the holes from the piece above it a technique I saw Nigel Armitage do and that worked pretty much.  The holes traveled far less and I was more pleased with the result.To top things off I forgot to press my logo on the inside pocket so I did it afterthefact and ended up with lines where the die got pressed into the leather.  I finished the item with a saddle soap scrub a coat of Obenaufs Heavy Duty LP and carnauba cream.  In that order.I was quite disappointed with this wallet over my previous results and I reduced the price for the client he didnt complain.  Thankfully the client was very pleased which probably means Im a much harsher critic on myself than I think.The good  Construction was clean and efficient.

3802181,0,t3_33yzlr,I am now lucky enough to be the owner of two antique Vergez Blanchard knives.  I recently bought these from a leatherworker in France who was kind enough to let me pick through his lot that he bought from a retiring leatherworker.Both knives belonged to the Angot amp Freres bourrelerie saddlers in Rouen Normandy. This hawkbill knife and also a head knife that Ill share once I get the sheath made for it.  Theyre both probably  years old. The aging on the steel is incredible and still so sharp. I will be handing these down to my children. They are apparently made with Thiers steel.The sheath was made by me out of black Horween Chromexcel and Fil au Chinois thread seemed an appropriate choice.  Edged with tokonole and beeswax.If anyone has tips or tricks on how to sharpen and maintain these Id welcome them.,Leathercraft,cqpog2b,1,t5_2sufa

4014058,0,t3_36gqgs,Hiya RedditorsSo this is my latest project a Simple Wallet with pockets of differing styles on both sides including a cash pocket on top.  The client also wanted a matching passport sleeve as he was about to travel which was very simple to make.The wallet build went really smoothly a little TOO smoothly usually SOMETHING goes wrong I have to fix.  I got a nice side of Horween Chestnut Essex from Maverick Leather in oz weight.  This was a design I had done before but previously I had either done pockets with centered chevrons or reverse angled sides.  I decided to do both on each side you know...for variety.The build started with a straight strip of leather cm wide.  Then I cut each piece out of that thus ensuring they would all line up when assembled.  Cutting went smoothly as did the embossing details done with a wing divider and the sharp end of my bone folder.  I also took the time to hot stamp my logo this time using a hair dryer to heat and I gotta say I like the results better than simply whacking it with a hammer.Stitching was a wee bit wonky on the thin part at the top where the leather was thinnest.  I used .mm Havana Cigar Ritza Tiger Thread and  John James needles.  Marked with Blanchard  irons.  Stitching went quite nicely.  Burnishing was done simply Seiwa Tokonole gum trag replacement and local California beeswax you know..for allergies.  The final piece gets a rubdown with Obenaufs Leather LP before being handed over to the client.The Good  Cutting was smooth and all lined up in the end with little evening.  Stitching was smooth except for some difficult times at the top.  Burnishing went REALLY nicely.  Sometimes simple is better.  Hot stamping the logo works much better than thwacking.The Meh  Need to center the logo better on the corner in the future probably by getting a better stamp that has even placing on the plate.Album ,Leathercraft,crdu0jn,1,t5_2sufa

I didnt want there to be a space between the inner piece of leather and the pigskin that back it so I glued it shut in the middle.  Because I glued it I put a line of stitches there.

5645849,0,t3_3s3axk,Cowboy boots saddles and traditional leather goods use linen a lot still. The advantage is that it bounces back instead of stretching as in quite UVresistant since its a natural product. Irish linen Barbours is the big name but there are other good ones especially in the finer sizes.Polyester and nylon are much stronger for their size. Nylon is stronger but more UVsensitive than polyester. Most of the commercial stuff that is massproduced will use nylon.Its worth mentioning Maine Thread which is a waxed polyester and comes in many colors but much more budgetfriendly than Tiger thread in the U.S.Thread strength is only one factor in the strength of a seam though. You probably want the thread to give out before the leather tears. Its easier to restitch a few stitches than to patch or replace panels. Just a few thoughts.,Leathercraft,cwwx7el,1,t5_2sufa

I knew I should have just searched Reddit!I have a small batch brewing in the kitchen sink right now. I went with the heat approach warming white vinegar up to about  degrees Fahrenheit before pouring over  pieces of super fine  steel wool that I carefully unraveled and stuffed into a mason jar. Theres a fair amount of bubbling going on and the vinegar turned reddish brown.Im not sure about the tannin content of the leather gloves I want to dye so I also have a French press that Im going to let sit for as long as I can stand so I can get a very strong coffee to soak the gloves.,Leathercraft,cx0qisy,0,t5_2sufa

5757000,0,t3_3u04cq,Some details for you White .mm Tiger thread sewn at mm oz leather for the interior oz exterior all of it Herman Oak from Springfield Dark red Fiebings dye the regular stuff diluted to half strength Red denim from my wifes sewing stash Glove snaps I already hadThis was made by request of my grandmother for my cousin who lives in Alaska. Not really a commission since I only charged for material.I think it turned out rather well although there are some bumps along the way. I didnt intend to line the interior with the red denim. I had to do this because the dye rolled around the edge. Since it looked horrible I had to come up with a way to conceal the booboo. Also because I lined it I had to sew the edge where the wallet folds over. Some of the stitches had to be spaced out a tad further due to the stitch hole falling right at the edge of the leather. I had this problem on the previous wallet I made see my post history and dont know how to fix it. I assume my pattern needs adjusting. If you have any suggestions let me know.

It might help even it out and bring it down to a really thin edge.I dont really like to skive the leather when its wet but that might just be personal preference.It might be easier to just fold once and finish the inside edge.

My husband is a knife maker and uses a lot of high carbon steels that would absolutely get funky if left in wet leather overnight. I usually do a couple of layers of masking tape on the blade and then wrap the entire knife in plastic wrap. The masking tape keeps the blade from cutting through the plastic wrap or the leather or your hands and the plastic wrap keeps the knife dry and protected. Ive never had a problem with this method and the slight amount of bulk the tape and plastic wrap adds to the knife has never caused any problems with the fit of the final product.,Leathercraft,czggpeh,3,t5_2sufa

6697236,0,t1_d0as6oh,You might be surprised. In my experience going too high end can mean less money. You might sell one  item a week but be able to sell three  items a day every day. In that case youd make a lot more money focusing on the  items.That can be the hardest part. Finding the best price point for what youre selling and finding a way to gear your time and product to match. Personally I could go higher end put more detail add tooling more timeintensive finishes on my work and charge more to match that.. but Id make less money overall. Im riding the happy medium. I make good quality but not highend. I charge a little bit less than a lot of similarquality competition. But I guess doing this full time You end up competing with a lot of hobbyists and parttimers in this trade and the practice and economy of scale that gives me allows me to charge a lower price but still earn  an hour on average.Another pitfall can be charging too little. If you are undercutting similar competition by too much a lot of customers will assume that your product is crap or defective in some way Why else would you be willing to sell your product for so little? and therefore not buy from you. If everyone else is selling a product for  and you charge  you may lose customers just based on the price. Youd end up seeing a surge in sales if you bump your price up to  or . Finding the right price point and what quality of product to sell at what price can be a crazy process. You really have to be willing to experiment and throw everything at the wall to see what sticks. Ive seen a lot of people try to start out super high end not get the sales they need to sustain that and then refuse to budge the high price or even raise their prices higher to compensate and fail as a result. Ive also seen a few people never get beyond a few sales to friends or friends of friends because their prices were so low it made customers doubt the quality of their work. Never get too attached to any specific price point and always be willing to bend where the market takes you.,Leathercraft,d0c1vuy,1,t5_2sufa

But I would go with an osbourne haft and one of their in awl blades. The in will open up the hole a bit more. But that will put you around . You could get a barry king awl but that would set you back I like the bulkier thread on sheaths and tend to use either royalwood ply waxed linen or maine thread  .. Which is why I recommended the larger size awl blade. You could probably get away with a tandy awl at  but be prepared to struggle getting the needles through since the hole will be a little to small.So if you want to make your budget. A tandy mm  and  prong chisels and a tandy awl  puts you at .

Also there are so many small things that youll need even tools under ish that add up and youll be halfway into a project before realizing you need even more.

7860767,0,t3_4mzl5t,I do a fair bit of wet molding when I make my costume armor. You pretty much submerge bare vegtan in water let the air bubbles do their thing by getting the water into the core of the leather. From here you can put the leather into whatever shape you want. Lie it over a dress form into the shape of armor you want wrap it around a mold of a gun if youre making a holster etc. Then you let the leather completely dry out. It will retain the molded shape. Heat will make the leather stiffer. So if you simmer some water over a stove then submerge the leather into that the higher temperature will make the leather super stiff when it dries out. Youll notice that if you use full boiling water the leather will shrivel and blacken when only submerged into that after about two seconds. When the leather dries out youre left with something very brittle and weak. The leather also shrinks dramatically and the shape is warped. You can test this with a thermometer and scrap leather so you can see what your max temperature should be when doing this. Using a heat gunblowdryer after youve molded the leather helps to speed up the drying process and help incorporate more heat to get the leather stiffer. I like to dry the leather out in the hot sun all day it produces a lovely tan to the leather and helps to stiffendry faster. You can also wet mold with hot melted wax. Get a big pot and fill it with water then put a second container filled with wax beeswaxparrafin and let it float in the water. Once the wax is fully melted dip your leather into it. Use tongs to remove the leather from the wax and carefully mold your leather into what it needs to be. If the wax is hot enough most of it will run off and the rest will impregnate the leather . You can then polish it when it dries. Wax will make your leather water resistant and makes a great finish. ,Leathercraft,d3zmdcf,1,t5_2sufa

7886823,0,t1_d42il0j,Ah thats a combination of a resist technique and paste antique. And since Im not some reticent old timer Ill share whats considered to be Sheridan correct. Once the leather is oiled to the darkness that you want you let it dry overnight. This is essential if youre going to paint the background but even if you arent it keeps inconsistency in hydration from effecting your resist.  Next coat it with whatever youre using for resist clear lac bee lac neat lac resolene etc. Let that dry an hour and do it again.  Rub the antique paste on thick with sheepswool and then quickly wipe all the excess off with a paper towel or what have you. Let it dry long enough to haze up about  mins. Sheridan correct antiaue paste is  and  Fiebings mahogany and light brown. It comes out too orange for me so I use Fiebings light brown only. Buff with clean sheepswool.

Ive been practicing A LOT and it isnt really improving. Im being consistent with the way the needles pass each other and having watched both of Nigels saddle stitching videos plus Ians video.

8492231,0,t3_4w0bxd,Not exactly favourite tool I like to have an awl with a flat sections on handle and the awl blade aligned  degree to that flat. Holding it tightly against my palm I can always find  degrees without any fidgeting. Another thing I must have on my awl is to sharpen the point till it is rounded  mm wide point yet still sharp. Having just a sharp point .mm wide on the awl IMO is not great because the hole has to stretch more than necessary showing stretch marks. Japanese leather knife. Would be great with a white steel version and blue steel. Sharpen the bevel till it is flat and follow up the back till it is curved in a way that when you cut the leather holding the bevel angle  degrees you get an even cut. When you practice enough you just tilt the handle to the right angle even sanding the top of the handle so you can measure the correct angle helps too. I have the angle at about    degrees so I dont have to put as much pressure. This knife is not great past  ounces of leather curves cant be cut at all. A round knife would take over from there. Example of angled cutting using single bevel Japanese knife. ,Leathercraft,d632t0h,2,t5_2sufa

Just like in wood work a finish helps protect the item from premature wear.  It helps preserve the leather.This is the wallet I have been using for  years.  It is the first prototype of one wallet I sell.  My puppy chewed up the corner  years ago pretty good.  It was originally stained black.  Now I dont know if you would call that glow patina or not but I like it.I see some people selling unfinished work and they show pictures of it after a year and it just looks grungy and dirty to me because they didnt bother to put a finish on it.  I have only been doing this  years so I dont have a definitive answer if the unfinished leather will fail sooner than the finished leather.  Maybe some old timers will know but I suspect that professional results come from doing a professional job which includes a couple coats of finish.,Leathercraft,da26s57,1,t5_2sufa

My edge burnishing process is as follows..Use edge beveler.Even out any hard edges with sandpaper so the edges are rounded.Use water and saddle soap on my finger going in one direction to lay down the fibers and wet the edges..Use either a hand burnisher or cocobolo dremel attachment at  rpm to burnish the edges. .I used to use just dye but edge kote actually has a flexible coating that forms and I like it alot..Repeat steps  and  until edges are smooth individually dont do step  then  and then go back to etc..I use edge sealer from goods japan to seal the edge kote and to bring down the shine..I rub bees wax on the edge and finish by rubbing with canvas,Leathercraft,dalm5la,1,t5_2sufa

I use them for wallet shells and rolled strap handles or anything that either takes a lot of weight or is subject to more than normal surface abrasion. Horweens CXL horsebutts are also really fantastic for exterior wear faces. Theyre super durable and somewhat soft for added flex but still confusingly hard enough that you can get a decent burnish on them if you really work at it as opposed to the bovine CXL thats pretty tough to burnish. ,Leathercraft,db3qw17,1,t5_2sufa

10312812,0,t3_5ni8sy,Ah the old Tandy beginner kit. Im betting more than a few folks on here started with one I know I did. Have fun and pound away. The only piece of advice I can offer that hasnt been said is if you like the experience of tooling leather when youre done making the items in the kit throw away those tools. Especially any stamp with a Z in the tool number. Theyre cast from crappy metal and the impressions they give will never look as good as other higher quality stamps. Im betting that even after you properly case the leather bevelling will be difficult due to the round edge on the toe of the beveller. I ended up using a jewellers file to square mine up and it worked better than out of the box but it was still one of the first stamps I replaced. My bevelling went from ew to ok just for spending those few bucks. And improved drastically after that. ,Leathercraft,dcd0hvy,1,t5_2sufa

10787673,0,t1_ddsnqlx,Custom stamps are our specialty!What we consider readymade art is very similar to a singlecolor screen print process. Art files must be full vector preferably in Adobe Illustrator .ai or .eps format. Like screen printing no vector objects must be colliding or overlapping. Adding text is very simple. So if you have the logo or artwork available in singlecolor vector format we would have no issues adding text in your font and layout of choice. Do keep in mind that our machining process will have a threshold of . for low complexity or . for high. What this means is that no small openings or spaces between objects or letters can be smaller than those diameters. Ideally it would be advisable to add another . to that number for the best possible depth and clarity when marking.  Thanks for your question!,Leathercraft,ddso5tp,3,t5_2sufa

10883881,0,t1_de2ib92,sure thing. Investigating your materials and their usage reveals about the limits of a process. Its just good craftsmanship to experiment and understand your craft. There is no reason and no excuse to pursue a craft based on assumptions. I think a large portion our community of leathercrafters glorify saddle stitching unnecessarily and demonize machine stitching. This is probably a result of seeing tons of poorly machine stitched goods from large low qualityhigh volume factories in addition to the fact that leather sewing machines are cost prohibitive when saddle stitching is remarkably inexpensive. Interestingly when it comes to productionprofit for the leathercrafter sewing machines are less expensive as they save so much time. And there are plenty of amazing people using machines to excellent effect. Even Hermes machine stitches. Though not exclusively. Many of their bags using machine stitching for internal pockets or low streets points but employ saddle stitching on high stress points. But then the bags such as the Birkin are relatively simple in pattern... so its not a huge ordeal to saddle stitch. edit and maybe the motorcycle leathers is a but unfair of an example... its a different stitch. a much beefier double stitch line with epoxy covering exposed thread. But the idea is there  know what youre using and why youre using it.TLDR experiment with all facets of your craft and employ each technique purposefully and with your awareness of each techniques limits,Leathercraft,de2lff3,2,t5_2sufa

I think we all know someone that has a nice handbag or watch they only wear on special occasions because they dont want to ruin it etc. Many high end wallets are beautiful works of art and Im both envious and awestruck at the craft. Im not one of those artisans. I want our stuff to be utilitarian more of a tool than an art piece  a big part of that is making it accessible via price point and availability and overbuilding it to withstand anything someone throws at it.We have a lot of customers that work construction and tree service and outdoor physical labor and they definitely need a thicker saddle leather with polyester thread for a wallet to last. We have guys that have clipped into our belts as a harness to support their own weight in a pinch  wouldnt recommend it but we build them to handle it as best we can.  Nothing against linen thread or thin leather its just not heavy duty enough to last for a lot of our customers and theyre not looking for a work of art they know is going to get beat to death  theyd wear holes right through it. ,Leathercraft,dfamhro,3,t5_2sufa

11333359,0,t1_dfbtlng,I second this comment. I tried so hard to burnish many scraps I had only to find out veg tan leather was the only one leatherworkers generally try to burnish. ,Leathercraft,dfgm7jg,1,t5_2sufa
11343001,0,t1_dfhc40e,I havent used any of these ideas yet.Something like these? Coated ones so they dont corrode and you can see the force they can exert in the specs.No guarantees from me that super thin ones will be strong enough or wont be broken by coins  you could glue the magnet in then glue some cloth over it to stop it from shattering?,Leathercraft,dfhpjrr,1,t5_2sufa
11348947,0,t3_61xet4,I have had the issue with the lip with some stretchier parts of veg tan leather I believe a looser grain portion placing the item flat and taking the handle of the burnisher applying light pressure and working out towards the edge can help form a more rounded bevel.  ,Leathercraft,dfidrv0,1,t5_2sufa

11498088,0,t3_644arb,New tools from okadatools! I received them in the mail about  weeks back and wanted to test them out before posting.  The tools are quite beautiful I got a planer  a diamond awl with a grenadilla wood haft and lastly and my favorite aestheticallly a round awl with Japanese black persimmon haft .  Here are my thoughtsThe planet is absolutely wonderful it it quite sharp and I was able to use it right away that is without sharpening or polishing.  It took time to figure out how to use it and how to position the blade but I can only get better.  The diamond awl was quite sharp but poorly polished and I had to take it to a highgrit water stone  and then over to the strop.  The tip suffered unfortunately likely due to my polishing and stropping.  It needs to be reshaped sharpened since the tip bends now.  The round awl similarly needed a slight polish not as much as the diamond awl but it was a bit rough in and out of the leather.  The black persimmon is so beautiful I wish I had used it for my diamond awl since I use it more frequently.  Ill add more once I get back home and on the PC. Cheers,Leathercraft,dfzb3i8,1,t5_2sufa
11508449,0,t3_649y19,The construction process was pretty much the same as uDeusis wallet how ever I hand stitched the pieces onto kangaroo instead of machine stitching. I think it turned out nicely however the middle pieces dont fold properly. Lesson learned! Shell Cordovan off cuts outside kangaroo inside! ,Leathercraft,dg0hfx1,4,t5_2sufa

11638410,0,t1_dgf6gji,No problem. And use thin coats of neatsfoot. I learned the hard way overoiling a few sheaths. I poked a small hole in the seal of the bottle and turn it upside down quickly on the cloth. With black you wont have any issues but for other colours nestsfoot can darken it quite a bit.,Leathercraft,dgf86fy,1,t5_2sufa

11716018,0,t1_dgo0obd,The projects you mention above do not require a lot of stitching indeed can be done entirely without a stitch. But anyway all you really need for sewing is an awl ish a couple of harness needles the thick ones with a round point and some thread. Refer to the side bar for more specifics.,Leathercraft,dgo1fwm,1,t5_2sufa
11728798,0,t1_dgpgnhn,You know I was worried about that going in but then I thought it out and came up with a plan.  One. I dont care about spending a little extra to get a sense of scale and ergonomics of working with a larger piece. So early in this project I realized a few mistakes Ill never make again hopefully preventing that on something more complex. Two. I would spend about as much on a bag this size anyways so might as well buy the hide and enjoy the process of making it. Three. I was still a little worried about regretting it so I went with a super simple design that I like.  It fits into a specific genre I love function dictating fashion.  Four. I can easily repair and fix as needed pulling the leather lace would be easy and the hide its self isnt gonna tear under any normal circumstances. I double ran the stitching at the top inch of the handles.  Five. If at some point I hate it which is entirely possible I can recover like  of the leather.  Which is presumably after use for a while.   I plan on using it as a weekend bag for a time and then swapping it to a beach bag where the sand can run out the sides.  I feel your comment and I was worried about it for sure but I think I solved those concerns in the design and end of life planning. ,Leathercraft,dgphn72,4,t5_2sufa
