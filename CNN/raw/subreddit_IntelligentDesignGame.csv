For human made structures the range of influence is shown when you build them.  Plants I dont explicitly show you but you can see the effect... if a plant is getting enough resources it will grow faster.  If you see a tall plant amongst lots of short plants its probably sucking in all the moisture.  I have been thinking about more obvious indicators but I want to keep some of it for you to observe using experimentation.,IntelligentDesignGame,dahwsvg,2,t5_3erix
