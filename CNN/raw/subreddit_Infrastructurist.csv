6385927,0,t1_czfgsd2,Because of compound interest. Money spent now on something that wont start earning a return for  years means the actual cost will he twice as much due to capitalized interest. The financing costs on large projects like this is often more than the capital costs. Paying a second contractor  more is nothing compared to spending  more on capitalized interest.

6875784,0,t3_49vyuf,Strange how the article posits a number of theories on why they never flourished here in the US but seems to leave out the highwayoriented road planning and guidelines that emerged out of the planning for the Interstate System.In the midth Century most municipalities let alone counties or states didnt have road and street design standards so they adopted roadway guides from USDOTFHWA. From my understanding of US transport planning history this seems to be a big contributing factor to the proliferation of stroads in addition to poormisguided land use planning and lightcontrolled intersections designed to keep traffic moving at speed.It seems FHWA has only recently adopted roundabouts as a means of promoting road safety but the damage has already been done. Itll take decades for state DOTs to adopt these new guidelines let alone apply them to state and local roads with transportation budgets at all levels groaning under exploding repair needs.,Infrastructurist,d0vomfy,3,t5_32h2a

8815646,0,t1_d77heag,People didnt leave downtown because of highways either it was the influx of blacks into Northern Cities during WWII to fill manufacturering jobs and then those same blacks being laid off first when manufacturering started dying leading to black urban ghettos. In the time period in question Rochester went from  white to  white. Again white flight was going to happen regardless. Insofar as urban highways are an issue its as a symptom of urban decay not a cause. Whites decided to abandon downtown first and then built highways second so they could still get to their jobs after moving out to the suburbs. Europe had less of a problem because they had less black people. Just that simple.,Infrastructurist,d77irab,2,t5_32h2a

9312671,0,t1_d8weo2e,The fact they are so important is exactly why the Government needs to stop letting excessive regulations and unions hold these projects hostage. Political will needs to be brought to bear to stop environmentalists and NIMBYs from causing years of delays and Billions of dollars in overruns. To force unions not to drag their feet while demanding   an hour wages working excessive overtime. etc.EDIT And ESA isnt even that necessary.

9327773,0,t1_d8y9gci,The level of the river never really changes much. The entire length of the river has a deep tunnel drainage system under it that collects stormwater and sewage and takes it way out southwest of the city treats it and sends it toward the Missisippi. In very rare instances during heavy storms the combined sewers can overflow into the river and the locks on the North Shore Canal north of the city are opened to let water flow out of the system into the lake. We get more flooding on low lying expressways than we ever will on the main parts of the river through the city,Infrastructurist,d8yd3mc,6,t5_32h2a

10629127,0,t1_ddcaz0n,Trump proposed spending  billion in infrastructure tax credits over  years there has been zero actual progress on it  where do you get approved is precisely what Im saying is not going to be skyrocketing demand for asphalt  especially since it will substitute not supplement public infrastructure spending. And since its to be invested in privately owned infrastructure that means those federal dollars will be converted into private profit not public benefit To attract investors they need to believe  trillion in infrastructure will generate  billion in profit per year.Democrats proposed  trillion in actual funding for infrastructure that belongs to and benefits the public.

11172593,0,t1_dew0sfx,Electrification suffers from a problem most people dont account for which is infrastructure density which can be approximated by population density.   The overall US population density is much lower than Europe the average density in the US is about  per square km whereas Europe is about  per square km.  All electrified traction systems require regular power injection points.  The ease and cost of building these systems is correlated to grid access meaning youre more easily going to find access to high voltage power near large population centers like the Northeastern US than in the middle of the Nevada desert or Midwest plains.  This is why diesel is a more viable choice for much of the US.  It is also worth noting that the US transport more tonnage of freight by rail than anywhere else in the world.  Part of this may actually be due to the population density of the US being relatively low making population centers further apart giving rail a competitive advantage over trucks.There was also another key point which the article touched on which few consider and that is taxation.  Building electrification infrastructure costs money every year in the form of propertyasset taxation.  Yes some of this tax is offset by capital depreciation but its still a large expense.  Diesel on the other hand has a lower tax profile as only the engine is taxable not the engine and electrical power system.,Infrastructurist,deyeg8z,1,t5_32h2a
