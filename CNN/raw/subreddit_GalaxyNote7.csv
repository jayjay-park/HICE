I usually go for the defender and remove the crappy screen protector but only commuter for this phone it seems at least thats all I could get from best buy. It does a lot better on the slippery issue I had with my S but still not as grippy as a defender Im used to. The sides are almost not protected at all due to the edge screen. It does cover the buttons which is nice. The upper and lower lip are barely enough especially with reports of how easy it is to scratch.

How the fuck does samsung  carries expect me to go well its cool Ill go back to my piece of shit Note  for an undisclosed amount of time till something comparable hits the market. Maybe the S is out in  months. I dont want a fucking S or Sanything. I want a fucking note. Even if i buy an S ill want the new note  months after i buy the S that when the next note drops. i dont want and be stuck paying  selling the fucking phone I dont even want off and taking a loss. Fuck that. I like the Note phones are like cars as soon as you drive it off the lot it loses value. Why should I have to drop  on a phone I dont want if I did Id have it then when the next Note comes out take a couple hundred dollar loss selling it to buy the fucking phone I wanted in the first fucking place.Its fucking bull shit. I still have my old Note  I almost sold it. Id be livid if I got rid of it and was SOL.  The only reasonable solution to this in my option is samsung  carriers should go yeah this is fucked up you can get this SE or whatever on loan until they fix the note  or the next note comesWhy should I have to get something I dont want and eat the depreciation because samsung made a bomb.

9373392,0,t3_586za4,When you get your box you can backup your phone with your laptop SD Card or GoogleSamsung Ive used all three ways and after a some modifications my phone is back to normal. I bought a Note  phone from Samsung Sherway Gardens and brought a broken Samsung flip phone to get  off. My friend said that Samsung wont be offering this anymore because too many people were using this offer. It was a time limited offer similar to the free Level headphone SD card etc. offers that Samsung has and it ended around the end of August. Samsung Sherway Gardens said that I could use the  credit or get a  refund along with the cost of the phone and Samsung case. Samsung Canada sent me an email saying I could get a  credit from my carrier eg. BELL credit or Samsung Online in your case if I buy an SE which is what I was told by a couple people I should buy. I can keep all my Note  accessories so I now have two extra adaptive chargers and USB C cables for the future Note . I was also told that the release of the Note  may be earlier by a couple months because the Note  was recalled. They did not have the SE in stock so make sure you can buy an SE or whatever phone you want before you return your Note . They said that they are not told when they will get new stock. They did say that their guess is about a week. They will call me when they get new stock. Im enjoying my almost perfect Note  meanwhile. Heres to hoping Samsung can Harness the Power in the new Note ,GalaxyNote7,d9456vr,2,t5_2zzb0

9408814,0,t1_d97kvdr,gt Many of the fires were user imposed wrong chargers covered with clothes sitting in the sun running the battery down playing games for hours straight while its getting hot etc and I dont even count those as incidents. That happens with any smartphone that is abused.Those are all situations where the phone should still not explode. Wrong charger?  It either shouldnt charge at all or charge very slowly.   Covered in clothes?  Phones should shut down or throttle down if they detect a spike in heat.  My LG G and Note  would both throttle down or shut off completely if they got too hot. Sitting in the sun?  Same thing should have shut down before exploding. Playing games for hours straight?  Same thing should shut down before exploding.Those are very much problems with the phone because theyre situations that hundreds if not thousands of the phones will face every day.  Previous Samsung phones handled all of those situations correctly.  If those situations were abuse that could result in exploding phones then every manufacturer would be seeing  explosions per day.,GalaxyNote7,d98msxc,1,t5_2zzb0

And actually any of the other regular types would be somewhat valuable too if Samsung does not refurbish any of the millions that were returned.  Anybody in possession of these should hold on to them bricked or not. People forget this was a worldwide news story that lasted for months at epic levels that impacted modes of transportation and the lives of many people.  This will go down in history as a major event and owning a piece of it will be a very good thing.  Personally I dont believe Samsung is concerned about anybodys safety they want them back so the users wont profit from it.  If it was all about safety they could have bricked them immediately for safety concerns. People begged for weeks for return boxes or at least a return call and got nothing.  But no they bribed everyone with a measley  to get them back.  Im not that stupid Samsung.  And besides that theyre withholding their investigative findings from the public probably waiting for every unit to be returned and then a major bombshell announcement will be released.  Again as Ive stated numerous times on this forum I dont trust anything they say.Keep your phone!,GalaxyNote7,dbbc2pz,3,t5_2zzb0

10452085,0,t1_dcst7or,gt The part of the benefit of the doubt is a judgmentNo. Benefit of the doubt means its doubtful if all lithium ion batteries will explode. Which means all phones get the benefit of the doubt seeing that they are not defective batteries. This phone does not because they have a defective battery and a defective battery will explode. The only criteria here is time and other contextual factors. I didnt call it a bomb but it can be justified because bombs explode. This is all semantics at this point. When you say bomb its simply a chemical reaction that releases heat after a release of energy. In other words it explodes. It doesnt have to be big or magnanimous. By saying it explodes were referring to the release of sudden heat and fire when a lithium ion battery is defective. It could either do that or quietly go up in flames. One means it exploded the other means it caught fire.,GalaxyNote7,dcsues5,1,t5_2zzb0
