251973,0,t3_1wxx8k,I went to the doctor for the nd time in about  years yesterday.  Called Healthcare Partners in Redondo off of Torrance blvd and had them pick one of the doctors for me.  Ended up with a fill in doctor who seemed VERY intelligent and she was super nice.  All the nurses and secretaries were great too.  A couple years ago I went to see some Borsook dude on Lomita blvd in Torrance and he spent all of  seconds with me and they tried to put me on thyroid pills and vitamin D pills.  Wont be going back there.,SouthBayLA,cf6vdqq,2,t5_2soym
2357065,0,t1_cm31gvj,Personally and this may be an unpopular opinion but I dislike Sharkeez.  The one in Hermosa? STAY AWAY. Its so crowded and just a mess.  The one in Manhattan isnt much better.  The music is so freakin loud and its packed and dark and its just not my type of place.  People seem to love it for whatever reason but if youre anything like me and like to just hang out at a place where you can actually have a conversation and SEE the person youre talking to I would not recommend Sharkeez by any means.  Im sure Im totally forgetting of some amazing places! Are you moving here or just generally looking for places to hang outdrinkhave dinner?,SouthBayLA,cm31lhg,7,t5_2soym
