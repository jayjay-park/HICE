5453286,0,t3_3pqa9j,Theres a fine line these businesses like Nike and Pepsi have to walk when they release products like these. Too limited of a release  they dont get as much brand exposure. Too general of a release  they fail to create demand. This is just how marketing works and well have to live with it. These companies exist to make money and produce products to create awareness of their brand that in turn sell other products of theirs. They dont exist to please fans.You compare these to Jordan retro releases. Anyone in the sneaker collecting culture will tell you that obtaining Jordan retro releases these days is also very difficult. You cant just walk into a Footlocker right now and buy a Jordan  in your size right off the rack at  for any of the generally popular desirable colors at least  the  is among the least popular designs. Nearly all sell out within minutes and for most where I live you have to enter raffles for the chance at an opportunity to even purchase the shoes before you had to camp in store lines overnite or have  browser tabs open smashing F every half second.The limited or special aspect is what makes people want the shoe. The only reason why the Air Jordan retro is so desirable enough for people to be willing to pay  for a pair is because of the Michael Jordan name and the everybody wants one but not everyone can get one aura that surrounds the shoe. Most of the cheaper mass produced and general release Jordan brand products sit on shelves and collect dust. If you could just strut into any Footlocker at any time on any day of the week and get a pair of Mags especially anywhere near the  price range I can almost guarantee you they would not sell as much as you think or generate as much revenue for charity as the auctions will.In addition it may not seem like it but in reality products like the Mags or retro Jordans are really more of a niche product and arent in as big of a demand to the general public  its just the internet makes it seem that way. Jordan brand makes only a small fraction of its revenue from retro product. Pepsi only sold out because maybe perhaps only  people were scrambling over  bottles Im guesstimating here but you see where Im going?. If they produced M bottles thered be  just sitting around. Comparatively the rest of the billions of Pepsidrinking population doesnt care what kind of bottle it comes in or havent heard of BTTF or remembered that Pepsi was even in the movie.All things considered I think the public auction is the best possible way they could have released this product. Theres still at least a widespread opportunity to obtain a pair unlike other limited releases  the Bruin is available in less quantities and only obtainable through like  outlets and it raises more direct awareness towards charity.How many people in the general public even know the Mag is even releasing this time around? I could walk out on a busy NYC street and ask  people and probably be lucky if even  knew it was. See the reasoning here? Im sure Nike has taken this into consideration already.,BacktotheFuture,cw8pjqb,1,t5_2rdxy
