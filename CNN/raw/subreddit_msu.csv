534365,0,t1_cg0p4aw,Having gone to school for five years here and being currently in my first year teaching for the university Ive gotten and appealed and paid more than my fair share of parking tickets and from my experiences dealing with that awful division of the police department I have to say I am honestly shocked that they repealed your ticket with that reasoning.I once got a ticket for the same reason but I was parked in a faculty space as a student for a total of about  minutes loading my suitcase onto a University bus for a Universitysponsored trip in the parking lot about  feet from my parking space.  The truck rolled up the guy got out and immediately started writing a ticket despite my hazards my open trunk and me calling to him across the parking lot as I walked over having completed my luggage transfer.  Jackass shrugged stuck the ticket under my wiper told me I could appeal it and drove off.I did appeal the ticket via a fiveminute appointment with the parking supervisor who briefly glanced over my ticket ignored my verbal recollection of the events as above and promptly denied my appeal.  I was so pissed off if the meeting hadnt been at the police station Id probably have showed her my finger and slammed her door on my way out of her office.  I really dont think Ive ever dealt with a more infuriating anticompassionate group of fuckers than MSUs parking police.  Good fucking luck on your appeal OP.,msu,cg10il4,3,t5_2qldh

I dont think being put in a particular dorm is really that important and the dynamics change frequently and every floorwingwhatever is different.

Burning couches isnt a tradition either. It started because lazy assholes left them on Munn Field when you could tailgate.

Not to justify any discrimination but you wont be Asian if you are a native English speaker.  Youll be the American who is Asian if that makes sense sort of like your friend you make from Texas who is black or your new Jewish or white friends.  No big deal.If I were to try to explain what concerns you might have I think its just a cultural difference between international students and their perceived inability to relate to the locals as well as possibly a bias against those perceived as rich which right now is stereotypically represented by an Asian international student driving a crazy nice car.TLDR Just drive a shitty car youll be fine I keeeed I keeeeeeeed.

3624506,0,t1_cq5315n,Im also a west coaster  grew up in SoCal living in SF  and can confirm all of this based on my impressions of EL. I also got accepted into grad school at MSU and visited for about  days with my SO recently. It does feel completely different from a big city e.g driving around and seeing how lonely the streets are seeing how quickly everything devolves into rural land once you leave the city potentially hitting deer on the way to a friends.I got to see how some grad students live and had reverse sticker shock. Rent is so cheap! Some people lived in luxury resort condos for under mo  min driving distance from campus. That was a major draw... picturing ourselves living in a gorgeous apt complete with home office dogscats and spending money to spare. That said my partner expected eating out to be cheap and it was not. A lot of the restaurants we went to had prices on par with SFs though maybe this is because we sought out nicer establishments.The worst part of it for me was not having access to Trader Joes or good Vietnamese food... not just because I love JoeJoes and pho but because its my personal metric for development and diversity. The Trader Joes thing actually may not be so bad since the metro area has some great local health food stores. Theyre building a Whole Foods and Horrocks even rivals the Bay Areas grocers. However the Vietnamese food thing is hard to get over. Im used to big immigrant communities. Diversity isnt great in the area  even the Asian population here is mostly international rather than AsianAmerican. On the plus side everyone is really nice and openminded and the sushi is excellent.Nature is great. Michigan sounds like a true natural wonder. Weather was not that great. Winters seem brutal. People in my program sound like they go a bit stircrazy in JanFeb. By spring break everyone needs to escape EL for a mental health refresh. The cities nearby seem great for that reason and often have more amenities shops restaurants Grand Rapids Ann Arbor. I wouldnt knock Detroit either. It sounds like its got some really upandcoming developments and culture.Personally I think it is totally feasible to make EL work for you. It will take a lot of adjustment but people seem just fine. It is worth mentioning that the economy seems a bit depressed so you may want to check out your particular industrymarket if you need work. Personally Im still weighing the proscons of moving there. Its a big decision so best of luck.,msu,cq5f5gy,3,t5_2qldh

5157967,0,t3_3lllxs,There are always positives and negatives to any University. I considered both MSU and UofM but decided on MSU. I grew up around Ann Arbor and spent a lot of time there in High School and still do.Honestly my biggest complaint about MSU was the city. I liked Ann Arbor so much better. There is a great downtown within walking distance and so much more to do! In terms of academic prestige I would say that UofM is ranked higher in general. But that really depends on the program. For instance MSU has a great physics program Vet program etc. But the UofM has many many great programs as well! It can definitely be said that the people at UofM are pretty pretentious but the vast majority are not. Some of my best friends graduated from there with degrees in ME EE and other types of engineering.You will also see many international students at both schools. And you will also find complete and utter idiots that attend both universities.I dated a girl who got in because she was legacy and I definitely wouldnt classify her as super smart. I also have met people that go here that are dumb as rocks. So if you dont want to read my ramblingTLDRAcademics depend on your program. The city depends on your preference but I much prefer Ann Arbor. Students are a mixed bag but there are definitely a few pretentious people at UofM. As well as a few dumb ones at both universities as it is in life half of all people are below average. If youre into Football we have won the past few years and do very well. If youre into parties MSU takes the cake. Driving is terrible on both campuses but worse at UofM. Dorms are terrible everywhere. And thats about all I can think of.If you have any other questions feel free to ask!!! Good luck!,msu,cv7q6wl,3,t5_2qldh

I thought the class was challenging because Im not great at math but youll be fine.Like I said all the firms are different in their own way. Big  isnt inherently bad if it fits your personality type. I wont say which one I worked for but Ill tell you a bit about each.Deloitte These are your cream of the crop straight . students with no social skills. Really great at accounting but good luck communicating.EY Basically like a frat house in the business world. If youre into that sort of thing thats great. If not look elsewhere.PWC This is the default big firm for MSU students. Its great for people who are above average intellect and social skills but really just want to use the company as a slingshot to leave public accounting. This is the absolute best firm to join if your end goal is in fact to leave public accounting in  years.KPMG Cant say I know a lot about these guys since their practice is very small in Michigan. Not a lot of great direct exit opportunities in Michigan but having KPMG on your resume in almost any other big city besides Detroit is a VIP pass. Great place to start if you want to work out of state anywhere.Plante Moran The default midsize firm for MSU students. I felt like it was super fake but a lot of the people who work here really love the company culture and their coworkers.Grant Thornton Exactly like the Big  culturally but it has that small town feel it everyone knows everyones business. Some people thrive on that and others want nothing more than to get away from it.BDO If you hope to work internationally this isnt a bad mid market firm. Otherwise its basically the Spirit Airlines of accounting firms.Doeren Mayhew The default small firm for MSU students. Most of the partners there are MSU grads and theyll hook you up.Rehmann These guys hire A LOT of interns but bring on maybe  of them full time. Great way to slingshot your way to another internship later on. Also convenient because they have a few offices around Metro Detroit and Michigan in general but are still a small firm.Crowe  Baker Tilly  UHY  Virchow Krause amp Co.  Yeo amp Yeo These guys dont really recruit at MSU but arent a bad option to fall back on or get a head start with.Benjamin Goldstein CPA Johnson amp Johnson CPAs etc.  H amp R Block  Liberty Tax Dont work at any place like these. Theyre all shady or complete jokes. It will basically preclude you from any real accounting jobs if youre caught working for places like these.Ford Motor Company Dow Chemical Company Meijer Great companies to work for if you like private or managerial accounting.If you like audit and want to leave public accounting bigger is better. If you like audit and want to stay in public accounting mid size firms. If you like tax want clients synthetically handed to you and hate your life Big  is the only way to go. If you like tax and relationship building small firms are ideal and medium firms arent bad.,msu,d0xz6cj,4,t5_2qldh
6951209,0,t3_4aw4eg,Seeing as you arent totally sure what you want to do if you think you want to study those fields you would apply to James Madison. But it would be a much easier application process with the same end result if you just applied for a non james madison major and just transferred in. Not only that but there is a really good chance you will change your mind about what you want to do after a semester or two. Almost everybody does. Its just impossible to know what the different fields really are when you are in high school. And most people tend to overestimate what they want to dowhat is realistic for them. For example of the  or so freshmen i knew who entered MSU in the honors college making a more difficult application process and more work the first couple semesters only like  actually decided to stick with it. It wasnt that it was too hard they just realized it was a waste of time and wasnt advantageous. But regardless of all that its hard to tell you how selective they are without really knowing your credentials. GPA and what not,msu,d1492td,1,t5_2qldh

As and one fail is a lot easier to explain than a mix of Bs Cs and a fail.Its definitely not a good thing but if it will be enough for them to either deny you or not let you in to that major is impossible for anybody to give you real advice.If I were you I would see if theres any way at all to still pass the class. If not and youre  sure youll fail Id go to your adviser at GVSU. They may have some better advice as to how to handle the situation better than us.,msu,d1j3k25,1,t5_2qldh

The major thing for transfers is you meet with your adiviser to discuss which classes convert smoothly and if theres any issues with transferring credits.

8276816,0,t3_4st90w,The best way to deal with this is the way I saw them deal with it in Japan.Indoor smoking rooms that are well ventilated and do not make the hallways smell at all. That way you dont have people crowding outside the entrances of buildings littering everywhere. The smokers simply vanish into some dark room until theyre done and their litter stays off the floor.Banning smoking simply is not going to work. I say that as an exsmoker who hates the smell of cigarettes especially the smoke of inconsiderate shitbags that I have to walk through on the way inout of the office.  People who want to quit have trouble stopping. You think youre going to get someone to drop it because of a policy change?

Criminal Justice is in the College of Social Science popular for students. Im sure theres also a student organization related to criminal justice.

10651825,0,t3_5sbiuv,I echo the leaving the door open... otherwise the rugby club would have never walked in and I would have missed out on the best group of friends I ever had...To go with that be open to new experiences and ideas people are very different from very different walks of life.  Those kind of friendships enrich your life and encourage growth.Dont be afraid to socialize move seats in lecture ask to join peoples activities invite people to do things with you. Dont be sedentary feel free to stay seated just do it in many different places. Campus is BIG no seriously you think you know that but trust me its BIGGER a than you think.  That affords you lots of chances to make a first impression and meet new people.Dont be guarded with your circles allow them to cross and mix.  If you want to play basketball ask if you can bring a friend or better yet if you can help find more people. Cant tell you how many times we went random door knocking to invite people out to seemingly small things.Fall  will be sooner than you think time goes fast been a decade now since my freshman year and it is probably where I made the most of my deepest friendships.Doesnt hurt to say GO GREEN freshman are pretty full of spirit... like alumni too but were nostalgic Pro tip avoid lanyards dead give away that you are an underclassmenwoman! ,msu,ddenjq5,2,t5_2qldh
