3135992,0,t3_2vlqor,I rolled a toon to romance Sera and then went But but Cullen. So I have to reroll into a Qunari or Dwarf if Im going to romance Sera so I avoid that temptation.,CullenMancers,con1j60,5,t5_36ajr

3878835,0,t3_34u4ae,I posted this on the other oneIf it doesnt have to be only Cullen related then Ive got oneI would like to see the relationship between Cassandra and Leliana during the time period before the next Divine is chosen see how they truly feel about each other being elected see how their friendship alters. Hell throw Vivienne in there too if you want. Maybe written in journal entries? Maybe a special section written by Mother Giselle showing her opinion? And if Varric is a believer but would never step foot in a chantry who does he hope becomes the new Divine? Whoever is chosen will obviously somewhat represent the Inquisition who does Josephine hope becomes Divine to make her job easier? Templars and the Chantry are obviously closely intertwined what does Cullen hope for? Does the idea of Leliana becoming Divine frighten him?Im just really interested in seeing something political. Thanks!,CullenMancers,cqyf5t8,2,t5_36ajr
4419368,0,t1_csmsk0g,At least you say it in a positive way lol Apparently the organizers got a lot of hate mail from Cullen haters saying Cullen doesnt need a positivity week because he is already so popular.  ,CullenMancers,csnsq01,1,t5_36ajr

5009544,0,t1_cuptwkr,Im sorry.  I dont know when Ill get the chance to play the DLC nursing school yay so Im seeking out spoilers like mad.  I GOTTA KNOW WHAT HAPPENS.  Sucks that people dont tag their stuff why do they have to ruin it for everyone?,CullenMancers,cupu8cy,3,t5_36ajr
5067789,0,t1_cuwtndr,I havent seen anything.  I think Battye did a great job.  There are a few awkward moments that cant be explained away with Cullen is an awkward romantic but overall I think Cullen came out great.Plus mabari!,CullenMancers,cuwuywd,8,t5_36ajr
5136510,0,t3_3lcmiw,Well for the last few days Ive been on my family trip still am actually and acting like a lazy bum when i told myself i was going to learn how to type good on my phone and put out some writing but i end up reading more Cullen stuff than writing Cullen Why are there so many talented writers in this fandom?! I just want to read them all and if i cant Im refreshing Ao constantly for updates than actually writing something of my own. ,CullenMancers,cv5537i,2,t5_36ajr
5177982,0,t1_cva0j1i,I might take a swing at this one! I think my total lack of baby care knowledge can only benefit me in this P although Im sure knowing me that itll turn out longer than a drabble!,CullenMancers,cva4xg8,1,t5_36ajr

5336479,0,t1_cvtm9c3,Yes!  Alistair is just...such a KID!  I cant see him as anything more then something akin to a brother.  Trying to flirt with him just makes me embarrassed for me AND for him!I can relate a heck of a lot more to Cullen as well.  Hes got more years on him but he also has a history behind him that has taken him down some dark roads.  But those experiences have made him stronger and given him that edge that you describe.Yeah...I can go on and on about Cullen.  I guess thats why were both here huh?  HAHAH!!I absolutely adore Dorian both as a romance and as my Inkys best friend.  I think the one thing to be aware of with a romanced Dorian is that he can be sassy and say things that could be interpreted as hurtful.  But the thing about Dorian is he tends to avoid expressing emotions in a way that is sappy.  Theres a couple times you can say things to him that are very sweetsappy and hes like Next thing you know youre going to be giving me puppy dog eyes! or something like that.  lol  In lieu of saying things that are sappysweet to his LI he teases instead.If you want to romance him I would highly recommend either an elf or a human.  Qunari and Dwarf both have some issues with positioning that can be a bit jarring at least it is to me.  As far as Im aware there really isnt a difference in his response to your character in terms of what race you play.  The one complete romance I did with him was with an Elf and I thought there might be some dialogue regarding the fact that in Tevinter elves are generally considered slaves but nothing like that came up.  Unless you count the dialogue with him at the beginning where you discuss slaves in Tevinter but that comes up no matter what race you play.  Not even sure if it makes a difference if youre playing an elf...  He might have a comment about that.  Either way it doesnt make a difference in the long run....Im rambling now sorry.  I think I need sleep.  LOLI wont give away too much.  You can PM me if you want more details.,CullenMancers,cvtsm2b,1,t5_36ajr
5393739,0,t1_cw13pqm,Yeah I dont really get the whole Sullen thing...Mine was Cullen gets kicked out of inquisition by a inquisitor with bad intentions goes back to Kirkwall and hooks up with Varric and Isabela and somehow pirates!shrug. I got like two chapters in before realizing that it was wayyyy more plot then I was prepared for. Im thinking about returning to it after I finish my kenricxharding story!,CullenMancers,cw13zdu,3,t5_36ajr

5419785,0,t3_3p9wxt,As I said before do what will make you feel comfortable. And besides when the fic is good readers will come. And if people are already enjoying and coming to read your story imagine how many more will once you are in tune with the story ?,CullenMancers,cw4fo3b,4,t5_36ajr
5483886,0,t1_cwbvaxa,The freaky thing is that the big ones are not the ones you should be scared. I mean they are spiders and I am not going to share my house with them but I get a bit less worried when I see a huntsman than when I see a red back,CullenMancers,cwcm8l7,2,t5_36ajr
