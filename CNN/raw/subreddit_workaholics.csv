4489907,0,t3_3ch9us,I think seasons  and the first halfish of season  was the golden age. Season four had like a  episode streak of bad episodes and only maybe  episodes that really made me laugh. Season  had some forgettable episodes and some gems and I have yet to watch season . Terrible product placement turned me off them spending a lot less time at work its the name of the show! turned me off focusing on pointless stunts instead writing funny material turned me off. Its evident that the guys are masters at impromptu awkward humor but they are not the most creative comedians.  Saying that in my opinion a good workaholics episode is the best funny thing to watched stoned tied with Curb your enthusiasm.  ,workaholics,cswm48y,1,t5_2shlj

It really has stopped being the Workaholics and is instead Workaholics and friends. Whether you agree with my opinion or not just step back for a second because this show has lost it. Just hurry up and get to season  so itll be over with for good. Edit I just finished the episode. What in GODS NAME was this episode even supposed to be about?
