2917133,0,t3_2tjx57,Scroll lock is what turns them on and off again. Its an annoying way to do it but I modded the keyboard to be always on. I always meant to do a guide on how to mod it I guess now there is a reason to do it but for now just use the scroll lock to toggle the lights.,coolermaster,cnzopic,1,t5_2txf0

10708536,0,t3_5t3582,Hi thereGoing for a Pro S RGB and setting it to white can always work. But a true white LED will always be more crisp white then on a RGB LED as they have to mix R G and B to achieve white illumination. The difference between the Pro M and Pro L in general can be but on the same keyboard all the LEDs should be the same brightnesscolor. If this is not the case like it seems on your Pro M you can apply it for RMA. Actually we are close to launching the Pro S also with white LEDs please refer to the link below ,coolermaster,ddki770,1,t5_2txf0
