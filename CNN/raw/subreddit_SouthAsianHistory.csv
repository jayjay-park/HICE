This mountainous region the culminating point of the peninsula is that which today bears the name Gondwana. It serves as a refuge for those dark populations too weak to defend themselves the cover which they find here manifests its security less from its ruggedness and untamed nature than from its dangerous climate mortal to strangers. The yellow invasion in this manner stopped divided itself into two branches of which one went up the valley of the Ganges while that of the other continued its march towards the South and proceeded along the coast of the Bay of Bengal. The first melanges between the Asiatic conquerors and the negroes of India resulted in the populations called protoDravidians which one may consider as nearly indigenous given the preponderance of the primitive element. The new waves of invaders drove back in turn these populations into the mountains and spread out over all the southern part of the peninsula bringing about another set of combinations among the races. This time the union did not take place more directly with the blacks but with the protoDravidians giving birth to peoples who deviated further from the primitive type and who are named Dravidians or Tamils. If one then looks into the major facts concerning the influence of the yellow invasion upon the races of India one will see that this influence predominates in the North throughout the valley of the Brahmaputra where undoubtedly over the centuries pressed the multitudes that were dispatched to Eastern Asia. The inhabitants of Assam numbering  belong to a nearly pure yellow race. The Bengal although presenting an extremely mixed population preserves heavy traces of the first invasionsinvasions which continued to spill out unimpeded over the fertile plains. In proportion as one descends towards the South extending along the Bay of Bengal one sees the yellow element more and more drowned out by the ancient dark layers however it is more recognizable in the plains among the Santals for example than in the central mountainous region where the Khonds Paharis and Gonds remain nearer to the primitive type and where one can still find authentic descendants of the negritos of bygone ages. Finally in southern India from Godavari down to Cape Comorin live the numerous Dravidian populations along with their different groups of which the most important are the Tamil group and the Telugu group. They represent the mixture of the yellow peoples with the negroes but to which were joined much later still other elements and especially the Turanian element. Before we talk about the Turanian invasions coming into the West of India and in order to finish with the yellow races we must say that the inhabitants of the high plateaus of the Himalayas and the valleys situated between this chain and the Karakoram if one excepts those of the Cashmere are composed of Tibetans absolutely like their neighbors of western China. But in this place we do not have to deal with the results of a violent and sudden invasion. These valleys and plateaus are less a part of India than of Tibet from the geographical point of view and the people who inhabit them have the same origin customs and religion as those of the former country. Ladakh Dardistan Baltistan Bhutan and a part of Nepal are occupied by Tibetans  possessing prominent cheekbones and constricted eyelids. Whereas one is unable to trace any exact time when the invasions which penetrated India via the Turanian gateway occurred and one has not seen any descending down this route since the beginning of historic times one does know by means of their detailed accounts the dates of a great many of those invasions which emanated from western Asia and which passed through the Aryan gateway. However the most remote invasions such as those of the yellow peoples are lost in the darkness of time and are known only by their ethnological results. The Turanians and Aryans are the invaders who have left behind the greatest civilizing traces. In a general fashion one can say that the populations of Hindustan owe to the first their bodily proportions and facial features whereas they owe to the second their language character religion and morals.  Hindus speak Aryan languages and yet only a very small fraction of this multitude is connected by blood to the pure white race. The Turanians arrived first. They initially established their domination throughout all of the Indus basin and also in a part of that of the Ganges then as their numbers increased by the arrival of new bands they advanced still further into the interior of the peninsula and at length penetrated into the Deccan. With their approach like what formerly happened with the yellow peoples a pushing back process occurred and the populations which were attacked too weak to victoriously resist took refuge in crowds within the mountainous and wooded regions which form the center of the Deccan. It is as we have mentioned in this elevated massif of the center that one must seek out the last representatives of the primitive inhabitants of India the protoDravidians or pure negroes. The most numerous and important of these peoples of ancient origin take the name Kol. They occupy the Chota Nagpur in the high basin of the Mahanadi River. They are divided into several tribes more or less Indianish but the true Kols who number about  have not yet adopted any of the customs or beliefs of the Dravidians who live in the valleys and plains. The denominations Kolarian group and Kolarian language borrowed from the name of the most remarkable among these indigenous peoples apply to the majority of the inhabitants and idioms understood throughout the mountainous region which traverses across the peninsula from the Gulf of Cambay to the Ganges. It is especially towards the eastern part of this zone that the primitive peoples become evident in great numbers and unmixed. Near the sources of the Brahmani River to the north of the Mahanadi live the DouangsJunglis or people of the junglewho call themselves the most ancient of men and are total savages. We have just mentioned the Kolarian language. We must hasten to add that languages are not able more in India than elsewhere to serve as the delimitation of races. The people who speak the purest Kolarian idiom are not at all an indigenous people it is the Santals group which is very strongly impregnated by the yellow element. As for the Dravidian languages they dominate in the South and yet that is not where it is necessary to search for the most numerous representatives of the oriental Asiatic race which imported them into India. Finally we see that while the original Aryan idioms are by far the most widely prevalent the peoples who can glory in having Aryan  ancestry are very much the least numerous. ,SouthAsianHistory,cjzu9hu,1,t5_2xhfg

8349686,0,t1_d5krje5,gtHumans generally like to have simple answers to complicated problemsI know I hate complex answers  they are always far less satisfying than having a person group or religion to blame.  The current political climate leads me to believe  that many people share this aversion to nuance.gtAll of those theories are true and together contributed to what happened and what is happening.It seems that when someone pushes one single theory it sort of tells you more about their own personal narrative or political leanings than historical events.  Though of course all history is an act of writing narratives rather than reading facts as I had previously believed.gtwe are to blame too because we let ourselves be pushedAnd many were all too willing and ready to ally with the British and attack neighboring kingdoms.  gtWhen people blame the British or the Muslim invaders I tell them that is just an excuse a cop out.This is absolutely true in the context which we speak of.To go off on a little tangentrant which is not directed at anything which you have presented I believe that the pendulum seems to be swinging back towards The white mans burden narratives and I always want to push back against that.  Ill need to do more research but even if somehow British colonial rule had a net benefit for India every serious book or published paper Ive read seems to disagree with this premise but that could be confirmation bias on my part it still does not speak to the morality of the action.  I agree that we are to blame but that also does not excuse the immorality and indecency of English intentions I also know that this is not something you posited just venting.  Of course  it is a complex story and there are no clear goodbad guys but I would submit that whether or not the affects of imperialism were good for India  this was despite  not because of Imperial intentions which were purely economic.  Ghengis Khan  tamed the steps promoted religious freedom unified cultures secured trade routes including the all important silk road uprooted ancient hierarchies and promoted meritocracy created trade policies which would lead to increased prosperity throughout Eurasia  did a lot of creative destruction etc but very few people would consider him a good guy outside of Mongols and their allies or blame Persians for his conquest of Khwarezmia apples and oranges since India was not a centralized empire.The British on top of common rape murder and looting  employed inhumane short sighted and  merciless policies i.e forcing Bengal to export  of its produce while it was in the midst of a famine which led to the death of  to  million people worldwide and created the third world Im not directing that at you since this is not what you were addressing  just using the chance to push back against the white washing and romanticizing of the British Raj which seems to be resurfacing with a vengeance in popular culture the blogosphere and media ,SouthAsianHistory,d5l9ifh,1,t5_2xhfg
