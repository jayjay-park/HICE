93104,0,t3_1v5l6i,We do a combination we start with spoon stuff yogurt oatmeal other blended things that arent finger food then onto finger foods for the rest of the meal.,BabyLedWeaning,cep12wd,1,t5_2znli
183889,0,t3_1w48ba,Thanks for sharing I really enjoyed this article. I usually make up a small plate for my . year old and then get him more if he wants more of something. Ill try having him serve himself. ,BabyLedWeaning,cezdrgf,2,t5_2znli
476974,0,t1_cfu60e6,Yeah thats what we normally do but we were out and didnt want him to get too messy. He also kept trying to shove the spoon as far back into his mouth as he could so my husband decided to hold it cause he was scared that our LO would choke haha.,BabyLedWeaning,cfuhgjh,1,t5_2znli
1410274,0,t3_2a9svc,I cant finish a whole roll either so I usually end up giving kiddo the rice while I eat the other goodies . He has had vegetarian rolls and loved them. Im going to be in trouble when he begins to ask for foods...,BabyLedWeaning,cit22mg,2,t5_2znli
1654965,0,t3_2cvo47,We started with cheese. Although we also introduced plain yogurt  my son loved and still does! it  their palette isnt the same as ours. ,BabyLedWeaning,cjnrsp4,1,t5_2znli
1860805,0,t3_2fwcrv,I have a similar concern. My wife is due to go back to work next month when LO will be . months. Were about  days into BLW and obviously theres a reliance on the  feeds from the breast and  bottle feed that I give which is pumped.  Pumping at work isnt really going to be an option for my wife so all we can think is that formula will be the way until she get to grips in actually eating more. ,BabyLedWeaning,ckdf6vp,1,t5_2znli

2087746,0,t1_cl56hbb,Youre viewing this in a selfcentric way. Perhaps the OP would read your response about waiting for bacterial development would want to learn about how to speed up the process and...VOILA! there is a relevant response in the same comment thread about the same issue. Doesnt that blow your mind?Especially since OPs baby seems very eager to begin BLW but is not yet at the recommended by some age of  months.,BabyLedWeaning,cl575ul,3,t5_2znli
2241257,0,t1_clofmjx,This! Make it so only by taking a bite can they get a piece in their mouth. It may mean offering a huge piece of food like a piece of bread or chicken breast but if you demonstrate for them theyll get the idea.,BabyLedWeaning,cloptyl,2,t5_2znli
3953288,0,t3_35qsbs,I think it just has to deal with how your baby is responding to the foods. We started out with  meal a day at  months. She tries to eat everything we put in front of her so we slowly added more meals in. Now at  months she gets  meals a day plus an afternoon snack. Shes also still breastfeeding times a day too.,BabyLedWeaning,cr6wpoe,5,t5_2znli
4433400,0,t3_3bt5cw,I ate these last night with a dash of cinnamon. They were awesome. My  year old thought so too.,BabyLedWeaning,cspinno,2,t5_2znli
4456726,0,t1_cssg2fm,Thanks!. Which foods have you tried with your baby?  ,BabyLedWeaning,cssga61,2,t5_2znli
5197232,0,t3_3m3puc,Hes still so young!! I didnt start offering once a day until over ten months and then only because I really felt like I should. She did not start eating consistently until  months! Shes tiny....less then  a percentile for weight but our dr isnt worried so neither am I. Although to be honest when she was  and all her friends were gobbling down food and she would just throw it and smoosh it between her fingers I was a little worried. ,BabyLedWeaning,cvcgkd0,1,t5_2znli
5210674,0,t1_cvdpmhy,All babies develop at different rates remember. My LO is  months and is only just started to chew up her food properly in the last month or so. ,BabyLedWeaning,cve2um5,2,t5_2znli
5564043,0,t3_3rblap,Looking at food and interested in food ! being ready. Six months is the earliest you should attempt and check with your pediatrician to make sure your baby has all the readiness signs.  sitting up unassisted put food in without gagging constantly and reach and help steer etc. The signs indicate DIGESTIVE readiness which may be different then when your readiness is. Dont let the grandparentscaregivers sway you on this. Babies go through several intense growth spurts from  months and it will seem like they are ready for foodalways hungry. False. Wait for their signs of readiness. ,BabyLedWeaning,cwmrq7u,13,t5_2znli
5809905,0,t3_3ur0at,One thing you can do to get extra iron in him if he wont eat pures is to make other food out of iron rich baby cereal. We do pancakes make a huge batch usually throw in some spinach or something like that freeze them and he gets a thawed one with his breakfast. Or just give him lots of meat beans dark leafy greens etc in his regular meals. No formula necessary. My kid likes pures well enough... I dont. Haha. Id much rather let him feed himself so I can eat too. If Im spoon feeding him theres a good chance Im not going to have time to finish my food. But baby pancakes are awesome. Good way to use up that extra spinach I always wind up with too. ,BabyLedWeaning,cxh9v5s,5,t5_2znli
6534640,0,t1_czv86f0,Hilarious! I hope you dont have to tell your husband to spit it out! when he eats a ladybug because that happened this morning  to my baby not my husband!,BabyLedWeaning,czv8fsy,4,t5_2znli
6558024,0,t3_45g4lk,Not at all. My daughter is offered a good selection of everything  veggiescarbsprotein and I just plonk it in front of her and leave her to it. Some days she will eat all the veg at one meal and not much else. Some days she will eat the meat...some days everything! I go with so long as she is offered everything and we are not giving her crap and she has milkyogurtcheese as snacks then she will pick out what she needs. Honestly I just wouldnt worry too much. I know of mums whose BABIES live on crisps and coke and chips!! So long as you are giving a healthy variety dont fret. You cant FORCE them to eat anyway. ,BabyLedWeaning,czxnjpe,14,t5_2znli
9329283,0,t3_532roa,We are introducing our son to an open cup. The new amazing health Canada guidelines for feeding suggest skipping a sippy or straw cup all together. Worth looking at even if youre not in Canada. ,BabyLedWeaning,d8yjz9e,1,t5_2znli
