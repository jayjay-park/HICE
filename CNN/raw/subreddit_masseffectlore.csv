178530,0,t3_1w49jg,Turians. I love the militaristic background and sense of loyalty and honour. Also I love the look of them. Favourite character from that race is Garrus. I dislike how they deem loses exceptable but understand the mindset and reasoning for it. Least favourite? Batarians. They are never portrayed as anything but pirates and mercs. In the entire series they are never depicted as anything but evil. Maybe Im reading a little too much into that but even the volus and hanar have their strong points. Also have to mention that the Arterius brothers are some of my favourites too! Many thankies for the flair!,masseffectlore,ceyrpe4,3,t5_2wk7k
247800,0,t3_1ww8z6,The Elcor serial killer. The Elcor werent really fleshed out as a race so to hear a mention that theres one of them thats a serial killer on the Citadel was really funny and made me wonder how that would work.,masseffectlore,cf6frue,3,t5_2wk7k
590821,0,t1_cg7cwnq,This isnt  canon but there are a few references to their aquatic roots plus they have the features. Head tentacles little folds at the sides and back of the neck. To me its not much of a leap.,masseffectlore,cg7fhwv,1,t5_2wk7k
3284048,0,t1_cp2lse2,Husks are created by Reaper tech by sucking the hydration out of a human and then replacing it with cybernetics to reanimate the corpse. Thorian creepers are constructs made by the Thorian similar to the Asari Clones that it makes constantly. They are not and were never human although they may be based off of human code like the asari clone was.They behave similarly because both creatures methods of attack require getting up close and personal to claw or spit acid at you. So to answer your question there is no connection between them.,masseffectlore,cp2lwks,3,t5_2wk7k
9185276,0,t3_4vw0ep,were there any big reasons for the extended lifespan of humans or is it just better medicine and technological developments,masseffectlore,d8gaubo,1,t5_2wk7k
9650715,0,t1_da2dshu,ME SPOILERS! It mentions the raloi left the citadel during the reaper invasion and rushed back to their planet where they destroyed all their satellites etc in the hopes that the reapers would see them as a pre space flight species and let them live. Thats an awesome idea and would make a really cool and kinda spookyscary story in and of itself. The galactic equivalent of turning off the lights and hiding in the closet as the axe murderer hunts around your house. ,masseffectlore,da2nfjb,6,t5_2wk7k
