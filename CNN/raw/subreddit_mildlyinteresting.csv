If it isnt the manager itll be the cooks if it isnt them itll be the customers. I will admit to not leaving tips from time to time. Rarely is it because the service was that bad sometimes you just didnt bring the bills or spent more then you had meant to.

That all being said  the history of Heiniken is rooted mainly in its attempts to both appeal to american markets but also be seen as a higher class beer.   They put WAY more effort historically speaking into marketing their beer as a uppity beer  than they ever did in making a good beer.that all being said  i dont mind it.   The night my girlfriend now wife moved in with me from out of state she drove a long  hours to my place with all her stuff  when she arrived at am we sat in my room drank heiniken and watched music videos youtube playlist.

Ingredients of article  Nondairy creamer NSFW ! gtTo replicate the mouthfeel of milk fats nondairy creamers often contain vegetablebased fats although nonfat nondairy creamerswhiteners also exist. Other common ingredients include corn syrup and other sweeteners orand flavourings such as French vanilla and hazelnut as well as sodium caseinate a milk protein derivative from casein that does not contain lactose. The use of a milk derivative prompts some individuals and organisations  such as vegans and Jewish dietary law authorities  to classify the product as dairy rather than nondairy. Those who rely on this classification will either not consume the product e.g. vegans or will not use or consume it in conjunction with any meat products e.g. observant Jews.gtInteresting Red Star EP | International Delight | White coffee uortusdux can reply with delete.

504340,0,t1_cfxiufx,I am going to disagree on the grounds that national gambling or gaming regulations of the United States and the UK are not comparable.  The United States functions with a federalist system of governance whereas the UK does not I think.  There are federal laws in the United States that regulate gambling and gambling machines but the majority of the regulation is left in the hands of individual states.  The regulations of individual states vary quite dramatically.  States that permit gambling will generally have a governingregulatory body  these are often known as a Gaming Control Board.  These entities likely function similarly to the British Amusement amp Catering Trade Association BACTA.  So develop a reasonable understanding of SWP games in the United States it would require research to be completed on the regulation of individual states.It is likely that few states have andor heavily enforce SWP games.  There are a few states that have actually banned games that could be considered skill with prize SWP  I dont know the nuances of the ban or how strictly they enforce it.  Ohio has placed a  limit on SWP games.  It would not surprise me there is a lack of regulation because few people have brought forward grievances to judicial branches of government.  This is something that few state legislative branches are going to concern themselves with as it is not a very pressing issue.  State regulation bodies too are likely ambivalent because it is not a pressing issue.  If crane games exploded in popularity then regulation would likely follow.,mildlyinteresting,cfxlhq7,1,t5_2ti4h

In the case of Autowikibot it just has to look for something in the format  take a note of that link and then query Wikipedia for the first paragraph of the article. Apply some formatting post it as a reply done. Minus things like the error handling code network outages being banned somewhere etc its likely just a few lines long.

845543,0,t3_23s24i,In short the difference between him live and him tv is because of the signal delay.  Considering his body position compared to his body position in the tv screen it is probable that the tv is set to the broadcast from the cable provider rather than an in house line.  The signal from the camera takes time to get through the electronics.  Here is an example from Spaceballs that shows a video monitor with an in house video feed line.  Notice how closely the positioning of the actors are compared to themselves in the video monitor.  It is virtually indistinguishable because the signal from the camera isnt passing through enough electronics to cause a noticeable delay.  Conversely OPs picture of the person being interviewed is noticeably different than what is shown in the tv in the background.  This means that there has to be a longer delay.  That delay can be explained by having the signal pass through more electronics before arriving at the tv in the background.  Most likely is simply that the signal from the tv station is being sent through the local cable provider which is then broadcast to the tv channels that the everyone can view.,mildlyinteresting,ch0e4oq,8,t5_2ti4h

Anyone familiar with French Russian Middle English or one f countless other Westerninfluenced IndoEuropean languages are aware of the tv formality system in which you use the second person plural pronoun to talk to someone who you dont know is older or is in a position of authority. In such languages you always agree with the pronoun not reality so talking to one person you could create a sentence like vi ne skazhete gde tut tualet? could you please tell me where the bathroom is around here? where you have vi you plural which agrees with skazhete you will tell second person plural.This is all to say that while the form is plural the reality and meaning is indeed singular.,mildlyinteresting,ch5av5t,1,t5_2ti4h

Then you cut the tree from the other side. This prevents the opening image from happening because the other side of the tree is already cut and there will be extra pressure if it tries to splinter out in that way even earlier.It has the added benefit of aiming the tree more easily when it falls over.,mildlyinteresting,ch9wbc5,1,t5_2ti4h

1071538,0,t1_chq23e1,Love is a temporary madness it erupts like volcanoes and then subsides. And when it subsides you have to make a decision. You have to work out whether your roots have so entwined together that it is inconceivable that you should ever part. Because this is what love is. Love is not breathlessness it is not excitement it is not the promulgation of promises of eternal passion it is not the desire to mate every second minute of the day it is not lying awake at night imagining that he is kissing every cranny of your body. No dont blush I am telling you some truths. That is just being in love which any fool can do. Love itself is what is left over when being in love has burned away and this is both an art and a fortunate accident.

1103822,0,t1_chtpd9u,miscibility and dissolution are largely an entropically driven process for the biologicals. think of the Gibbs free energy of the system where enthalpy is essentially zilch because the solubility parameters contribute so little compared to the TDS component.  and change in entropy is minimal because the leaves have so many confirmations in a random arrangement of flowers that addition of a few droplets of water contributes virtually nothing to the infinity of possible leaf and flower arrangements. this is why the cut flowers wilt incidentally water cannot get into the plant because it has no real entropic contribution. ,mildlyinteresting,chtreqw,1,t5_2ti4h

1186654,0,t1_ci2etub,gtGiven the recession that we are in and the old used Taco Bell hot sauce market has taken major hits Id be willing to take it off your hands for  but you have to pay up front.Ive been saying this for years you should have diversified into gold hot sauces e.g. China has recently replaced India as the worlds largest consumer of hot sauce. Uniquely it also ranks as both the largest producer and the biggest importer of hot sauce. Yet a big question surrounds the true state of the Chinese demand for hot sauce the answer would determine how global hot sauce prices are likely to fare. The expectation that Chinese investors will sustain a voracious appetite for hot sauce has helped to spark a recent rebound in hot sauce prices.Speculation abounds about a large trove of hot sauce that seems to be missing from the global hot sauce market. Analysts calculate that up to  tons or more are stashed away based on the difference between Chinas domestic hot sauce production of  tons in  plus its estimated hot sauce imports of at least  tons and its annual demand of about  tons. The Chinese government does not release an import figure so this number is disputed.Now its easier than ever to add gold hot sauces to your portfolio. By using my patented step method you can protect your hot sauce portfolio from downturns in the market. We all remember the great Srirachapocalypse of  None of my clients have lost any hot sauce in the current recession using my hot sauce investment strategies.

Ended up as a supervisor but turned down the driver position for some odd reason.  This was yeeeeeeeeeears ago.  The amount of shit I heard about employees having a small crime ring of stealing shit was unbelievable mainly cell phones...they busted the packages open and somehow discared them.

And I just looked at the graph  what you could have done was just googled military spending and gotten a pretty good breakdown like here Since your knowledge of the military spending is apparently  satiated and already smoking a cigarette by just looking at an upworthy graph heres a better breakdown of the spending. billion for continual training of the armed forces. million for a DoD institute for infectious diseases. million for a counterterror program.. billion in military family support  that is high quality healthcare and education for their children.. billion in military health systems such as new hospitals. million towards traumatic brain injury medical costs. million to the medical support of the wounded ill and also towards medical research and PTSD treatment.. billion invested into military defense technology. billion to modernize the weapons systems for soldiers in the field.. million in cybersecurity research and defense.. pay raise for active military personnel.So I have literally done all of the work for you. This isnt the entire spending report but its a fair chunk of it. What would you cut from the budget? Because I feel like you believe the money goes  into guns and bombs which is pretty hilarious.And heres a link to the actual budget. Take your time.

1400413,0,t1_cirt0fk,Thats so rude and unnecessary. If all it took was not being a whiny bitch nobody would be overweight. Its so much more than that. Along with weight loss journeys comes a whole slew of other factors that are mental physical interpersonal etc. Ive seen some people drop weight quickly and efficiently but have horrible emotional battles because they had to learn to cope with underlying food addictions. Ive seen some people struggle horribly to lose weight despite hard work and consistency because they physically couldnt exercise or they had medical conditions that made the weight harder to lose example several close friends with PCOS weight loss is a bitch for them and Im amazed to see some of those friends sticking to it despite the pain. I can understand that you personally may have had an easy time with it and find it as simple as doing some math and lifting some weights but just because thats your experience doesnt mean that it is everyone elses. I cant imagine how you can honestly justify calling other people whiny bitches for going through the same journey as you. If anything you ought to be really appreciative of the fact that your own journey was apparently so easy and should respect others for sticking to their guns despite strugglessetbacks. ,mildlyinteresting,cirtm01,6,t5_2ti4h

No ones arguing that.As someone who is a scientist who studies sprinkles I am telling you specifically in science no one calls jimmies sprinkles. If you want to be specific like you said then you shouldnt either. Theyre not the same thing.If youre saying sprinkle family youre referring to the taxonomic grouping of Toppings which includes things from nuts to caramel to whipped cream.So your reasoning for calling a jimmy a sprinkle is because random people call the rainbow ones sprinkles? Lets get chocolate and licorice in there then too.Also calling someone a human or an ape? Its not one or the other thats not how taxonomy works. Theyre both. A jimmy is a jimmy and a member of the sprinkle family. But thats not what people say. They say a jimmy is a sprinkle which is not true unless youre okay with calling all members of the sprinkle family sprinkles which means youd call all other candy sprinkles too.

1717642,0,t1_cjvngdw,Oftentime the Its just tap water argument is less about it being literally tap water though it certainly often is and is more about it being not different in a meaningful way from tap water.  It doesnt have to meet more stringent quality nor purity standards than tap water. Indeed in the description you just gave it would appear that mineral and spring water in Norway is actually held to standards that imply a worse qualityofproduct to drinking water.  You arent allowed to remove as many impurities or disinfect the water chemically or through other means which could very much be a step toward increasing quality and purity.  And drinking water could certainly have minerals or live cultures added to it if it was desired.I always prefer to phrase it as Its worse than tap water but then again I live in one of the parts of the world that has a great watershed and fabulous natural water so its particularly idiotic when I see people drinking bottled spring water.  Spring water is whats in the taps.,mildlyinteresting,cjvo6ss,134,t5_2ti4h

1799508,0,t1_ck5pywd,Its a holdover from Prohibition when we made a constitutional amendment to ban alcohol It didnt last long.Being an alcoholic is considered a very immoral thing in America. Its not about how much you drink Its acceptable to get wasted at a bar every night or why you drink Because you have unresolved issues or a chemical addiction that makes you an alcoholic. In America being an alcoholic means being drunk at the wrong times and places Showing up to work every morning hungover or being unable to sit up straight in a parent teacher conference. Banning drinking in public lends to the notion that one should be sober in public and not conduct yourself in an unseemly manner. If you can hold your shit together in public nobody cares that you drink everywhere else. Your friends might be honest with you about your problem of course.And you damn well better stay sober because public urination will wind you up on the sex offender registry next to rapists and pedophiles. At least drunk and disorderly usually isnt usually that bad but you also get tagged with resisting arrest usually and then youve got a rap sheet that subjects you to further profiling as a criminal.,mildlyinteresting,ck5zdf8,0,t5_2ti4h

We had one customer approve it and we were seriously questioning them on it afterwards. I also have to calculate ask strings for mailings and there are often times where the calculation the customer asks for does not make sense and I have to show them why. For instance we have a last gift. Ask is lg rounded to nearest . Ask is lg. and ask is lg. The wording will say double your last gift to ask. Only their calculations will have . which ask rounds to  but ask ends up being .. So I have to educate them that ask has to be ask. and then go through the process of them not understanding why. ,mildlyinteresting,ck8kad3,1,t5_2ti4h

Proponents of the technique claim that aligning a subject with these points creates more tension energy and interest in the composition than simply centering the subject would. citation neededgtgtImage from article iInteresting Rule of thirds diving | Rule of thirds military | The Rule of Thirds Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwckkjv oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeleteckkjv.

2083269,0,t1_cl4ji6o,FIFYgtActually soothingness is a word. It is a word that you created. It is a neological word that has its own distinct meaning and there is nothing anybody can do to prevent anybody from using a neological word such as soothingness.    gtNeology The Word That Created NeologygtI always wonder what I should do when I dont know the meaning of a word. Should I look it up in the dictionary? Should I use context clues? Should I ask somebody what it means? It has been  years that I have been living by these questions. However today I realized something it isnt essential to know the meaning of intricate words in order to sound perspicacious. I learned that to sound smart I can simply use neology to make a new meaning for words or even make new words altogether. Neology or the practice of making up words or meanings for words is useful when one does not have the most insightful diction.gtOne example that comes to mind when I think about neology is a thread on Reddit.com called VXJunkies. On this thread users of Reddit post issues or developments on their transdirectionally magnetized motors. To the everyday person viewing this thread these words look extremely smart. Some might even think these issues and developments sound genius. Another thought that most people think when they see these posts is Wow I must be an idiot. I have no clue what these people are talking about. I know that is how I felt when I first saw VXJunkies. Now from the point of view of somebody who posts on VXJunkies it is quite hilarious when a newbie submits a post like What the heck is VXJunkies?gtThe funniest thing about VXJunkies and the neology that is used to trick people is when somebody says This is all bogus. All of the big words you guys use are fake. When these posts happen everybody in the VXJunkies community comments with neological words and usually nobody breaks character.gtHere is one example of a post of rVXJunkiesI just fell prey to a pretty embarrassing prank today. A buddy of mine works on trac cordons and is intimately knowledgeable about the diamondmatrices in modern VX oblidisks. I was having some trouble reading my deltas and pinned the problem on the oblidisk so I asked him what I should do. He asked if there were any wireless cormionphasers nearby he knew there were as it turns out and when I said yeah he looked very concerned and said you should cover them in foil when your VX is running. If uncovered they interfere with the borgonprocess Id do it today. If its not done soon you may lose your oblidisk.I then spent the better half of a day covering all of my labs  cormionphaser modules in foil. My buddy works in the same facility and after I finished he came by and told me oblidisks dont utilize the borgon process. You shouldve seen the grin on his facegtOne word to note is oblidisk. What the heck is an oblidisk? I dont know and nor does the person that wrote this post. Even though oblidisk doesnt really mean anything it is a very common word on this thread. It has grown from a nodefinition word to a part of the VXJunkie jargon that lots of people dislike. With the use of neology many people have given a meaning to the word oblidisk as such it wouldnt be surprising to see this word in the dictionary eventually.gtThere are over  new words added to the Oxford dictionary every year due to Neology. Some would say this is a duplidocious amount of words.  words added to the dictionary every year is crazy considering this editorial has less than  words. However it is duplidocious because this amount of words is also an impressive number. Not many people could say they thought of  new words all by themselves. Neology is not only an interesting word due to the structure of the word the placement of the N and the Os is absolutely perfect in my opinion but also because it is necessary to have lots of people to create such a vast amount of new words each year. Finally Duplidocious is an example of a neological word that was created at the beginning of this paragraph.Next I think that some words are difficult to pronounce. One word that comes to mind is pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis. Another word that comes to mind when thinking about lettery words is floccinaucinihilipilification. These words are unnecessarily long and could easily be shortened to pneumonicano and floccination. On a more logical note I made up the word lettery Why did I do this? Well for starters I wanted to prove that neology is actually somewhat useful once in a while. Secondly I did not feel like using a browsing a dictionary to find the correct word for difficult to pronounce so I decided to use lettery which is similar to wordy.gtSome people all over the world are beginning to experience things that dont necessarily have a word for them so they just make up a word that fits that feeling. Other people dont know how to pronounce words very well. As a result of this need for new words and the lack of knowledge of the pronunciation of other words neology has a special place in the English language and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.gtEdit This an essay I just completed if you couldnt tellFIFY on Reddit you need to leave a line in between paragraph breaks. Oh and TLDR A rambling essay about Neology which is pretty decent actually.,mildlyinteresting,cl4mnlx,4,t5_2ti4h

No ones arguing that.As someone who is a scientist who studies phone cases I am telling you specifically in science no one calls that TPU plastic. If you want to be specific like you said then you shouldnt either. Theyre not the same thing.If youre saying TPU plastic family youre referring to the taxonomic grouping of Plasticy which includes things from purple plastic to blue plastic to black plastic.So your reasoning for calling that TPU plastic is because random people call the phone plastic green? Lets get fancy plastic and not so fancy plastic in there then too.Also calling someone a human or an ape? Its not one or the other thats not how plastonomy works. Theyre both. A phone case is a phone case and a member of the TPU plastic family. But thats not what you said. You said a phone case is TPU plastic which is not true unless youre okay with calling all members of the phone case family phone cases which means youd call blue cases black cases and other cases phone cases too.

We tackled a different friend and started scratching him with it. Why? I dont know kids are stupid.So we thought we were just effectively scratching him and were all laughing having a jolly good time when we see blood.Then more blood.Then more.Our friend freaked out. We realized that every single scratch wed made was an open and bleeding wound. He stood up and there were no less than  trickling lines of blood across his body. Amazed that someone could start bleeding at something so innocent I ran the ruler down my arm half a dozen times. It felt no different than if I had used my nail. Sure enough though blood slowly started trickling out.We started freaking out because this was on a group trip of some sort and we just made our friend look like Carrie.

During the autopsy on Wednesday the mortician found the game pieces lodged in the victims throat were the rare boardwalk piece and a free coupon for a small soft drink.

2484265,0,t1_cmity19,ampampamp Karg sfw gtgtKarg is a character in the  movie Masters of the Universe by Cannon Films. The movie was based upon Mattels bestselling toy line of the same name although Karg was a brand new character created by the films writers who never had an accompanying action figure.gtPlayed by Robert Towers Karg was a minion of the films main villain Skeletor Frank Langella and the head of Skeletors bounty hunters who commanded Skeletors militia. He was designed as being half man and half bat although this is not immediately apparent from his appearance. He is a strange grotesque creature with high and long white hair pointed ears and a tight bodysuit his torso covered by shining black armor. A long black cape adorns his back his shoulders covered by a fur stole and he has a hook in place of his left hand. His overall appearance with his elegantlycombed hair and carefullyfitted clothing is almost regal and resembles a mediaeval monarch suggesting an element of respectability and even vanity about his character contrasting strikingly with his undoubtedly ugly gruesome visage.gtgtImage iParent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcmity oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeletecmity.

Vaccines are unnecessary and do not help. The diseases they claim to prevent are unproven independently and more often than not cause more harm and damage than the diseases they are marketed to prevent. The fact that soulless medical corporations must use such underhanded tactics to push lies speaks volumes.  Such pathetic and over the top PR would not be necessary if the vaccines worked and were safe.  Your tactics are just sad.  Speaking of public education as though its beneficial to anyone.

2515023,0,t1_cmmqwp0,Someone once told me that up to MHz electronics is a science but after that magic begins. I cant really tell you because I dont know  I was just told that it wouldnt work. Possibly because not all cores are good enough to get to such a frequency so its easier to choose the strongest and overclock that than to overclock every core. Also notice that the voltage was upped to over V so the amperage that would go through the all cores could destroy something on its path but since its lowered for just one coreblock its OK. I dont know the pinout of AMDs sockets nor for Intels but whatever but if the power pins are shared across all cores it could be a problem.Sorry I couldnt tell you where the problem lies.

In the Australian system a territory is any territory in the Commonwealth that isnt claimed by a state and cannot legislate itself.  NT and ACT are both territories but have been granted the power to selfgovern by the Australian Government. So I think thats basically it. States derive their ability to selfgovern through the Australian constitution and selfgoverning territories derive their ability to selfgovern through the Australian Government. I believe selfgoverning territories also have a more limited power than their state friends.Australians Im sorry if I got that wrong.,mildlyinteresting,cmt37tu,2,t5_2ti4h

It definitely has reason to exist to drop that awesome story on the western audience that doesnt want to watch a foreign film and thats okay. It does a stand up job at doing that. The original is a piece of art the remake is a recapturing of the piece of art. Its akin to a translation of book of course it wont be the same.

2636216,0,t1_cn2d5bs,Ill give it a goTo understand the offside rule try to understand why its in place whats its trying to achieve. Ill give you an extreme example where Ill assume you understand the basic terms of footballsoccer...Imagine one team in a typical football formation keeper defenders midfielders and strikers. Now lets say the team they are against for some crazy reason has their whole team except for their goalkeeper standing on the halfway line.If one of the first teams strikers were to run beyond the opposing teams line of players along the halfway line and toward their goalkeeper he would be in an offside position. Why is this unfair? Think about it if one of his teammates had the ball all they would need to do is boot the ball in the air over the halfway line in the general direction of their striker.Now the second team would have a player oneonone with the keeper with no one else around to challenge him. It would typically take  seconds of fullon sprinting to get from the halfway line to either yard box.So if you understand why this scenario would be unfair you understand the offside rule. To make it less extreme and more realistic simply move the line of defending players closer to the opposing striker. There are some special cases to the rule but essentially you cant have an attacking player between the oppositions last defender and their goalkeeper if the ball is being played passed to that offside player specifically.EDIT Clarified offside player needing to be involved in play vs just standing in an offside position.,mildlyinteresting,cn2oq5x,1,t5_2ti4h

2641414,0,t1_cn3chcl,It all began at a restaurant out on a pier in Galveston appropriately named Jimmys on the Pier. At the time I was  so I cant really say I was too young and naive to know better unfortunately. Family Vacations with my stepdads side of the family were fun but they were all very conservative so no cussing or other vulgar comments to make the trip more memorable. We sat down at a big table and our Ukrainian waitress took our drink orders right away. The atmosphere became pretty boring alongside the topic of conversation so I walked out onto the actual pier for some fresh air. The sun was setting as I watched waves steadily roll into the shore and soon all the sounds of waves rolling in made have to pee. So I walk through to the back of the restaurant and go into the single person bathroom. Thankfully the door had a lock because Ive always been paranoid of someone busting in while my pants are down. Everything was pretty standard in there urinal toilet sink. And I as went to wash my hands... I noticed a small bowl with matching tiny spoon full of orange crystals. Immediately I stopped and had to smell it of course. And my what a smell like freshly mangled orange peels. At this point I was still really hungry and I made a connection in my head somehow spoon plus bowl plus good smell must equal food. So I fucking eat it. A big spoonful. Now most of you are aware Im sure what I just ate. For those of you who arent it was scented salt scrub for your hands. I quickly knew exactly what it was and spat out the stuff all over the sink and washed out my mouth  times or so. Later I had to go back to the table with my head hung low and explain what the hell I just went through in there. Everyone had a laugh at my perfumy Orange breath and the story of how it came to be. As for me I learned that valuable lesson of not trusting spoons. TLDR Fuck spoons. ,mildlyinteresting,cn3d5jt,12,t5_2ti4h

Say NO so he takes you to the door. . Then go into the museum and go upstairs and talk to the Lady who says I want My boyfriend to catch me a Pikachu! . After you talk to her immediatly come out of the door and once you come out of the door do not take any steps forward. left or right. Immediatly use fly and go to Celedon City. . Go to the Safari zone and catch a Tuaros. Leave room in your pokemon slots. So only bring  when you go to catch him. Then put tuaros in your st slot. . Go into the Game Corner and talk to the Lady that says Go Next Door to the Coin Exchange Corner to use your coins to get great Prizes! . But this time she will say Hey? You have all the badges? WOW!

Then go to Proffesor Oak and he will say the same thing he says when you give him Oaks Parcel it will still say YOU DELIVERED OAKS PARCEL! . Then when you go into your pokemon line and it will replace the Pokemon in your first slot. So put a spearow or something in first.

2763212,0,t3_2roft5,I happened to work in the hospital where I had mine done and the fortune to be buddies with the doc doing it. He let me scrub in on the procedure on my own junk and I got to hold the clamps that were holding my vas def. It was remarkably interesting to feel an internal sensation from something my hands were doing. Okay that sounded really weird but Im gonna leave it. And the procedure barely hurts at all most people are just freaked out by the thought of their tackle being sliced and cooked which makes them feel way more pain. I did mine sans anaesthetic no problem. But then again Im the weirdo who teaches junior medics how to suture using my own flesh. ,mildlyinteresting,cni60a3,1,t5_2ti4h

Unsaturated colors such as pink or purple variations such as magenta are absent for example because they can be made only by a mix of multiple wavelengths. Colors containing only one wavelength are also called pure colors or spectral colors.gtVisible wavelengths pass through the optical window the region of the electromagnetic spectrum that allows wavelengths to pass largely unattenuated through the Earths atmosphere An example of this phenomenon is that clean air scatters blue light more than red wavelengths and so the midday sky appears blue. The optical window is also referred to as the visible window because it overlaps the human visible response spectrum. The near infrared NIR window lies just out of the human vision as well as the Medium Wavelength IR MWIR window and the Long Wavelength or Far Infrared LWIR or FIR window although other animals may experience them.gtInteresting  nanometres | Optical telescope | Geometric albedo | Ultravioletvisible spectroscopy Parent commenter can toggle NSFWmessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcnrzszi oror deletemessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot DeletionampmessageBdeletecnrzszi.

2931874,0,t1_co1cgpb,Adamson What about your Tom and Jerrys in comparison with Hanna and Barberas? Yesterday in the projection room you said you never understood Tom and Jerry.  Jones Well I didnt understand them the way Bill and Joe did. I tried to make them like Bill and Joe tried to think the way they thought but it didnt work out well so I just kind of changed the characters to fit my own way of thinking. They used a kind of violence I seldom used and if I did use it it was a mistake and I regretted it. One example would be in their golfing film where the ball hits Tom in the teeth and leaves a hole there and then the teeth fall out. They would have an axe come down and take all the fur of the back including his tail. That kind of thing to me is much more hurtful than somebody falling off a cliff. Or if the Coyote lights a bomb and the whole thing explodes hes left there all black and then you cut immediately and hes whole againdeath and resurrection. So mine were Id say much gentler than theirs but probably not as funny. I was never able to get quite as much character in Jerry. I thought they did a smashing job on Jerry I thought his personality was always delightful. I probably got a more human personality out of Tom than they did but not the same character. Tom was pretty vicious in their stuff and was a clearcut villain.  As I developed if I developed it was on the idea that nothings clearcutand it shouldnt be in comedy. You should be able to understand either side. You should be with the hero hopefully the idea that Gee I wish I could be that waybut with the villain you should also recognize There but for the grace of God go I. So you get involved. In all of my things I get involved. In The Dot and the Line I associate completely with the Line I knew what he was. But I also understood the Squiggle I knew what his problems were. Thats why Bully for Bugs was a particularly good Bugs Bunny because the losses were equally shared. Bugs had almost as many problems as the bull did.Q Could you compare the Road Runner series with the Tom and Jerry series which you took over in ? They seem similar enough that there might be some overlap in concept.  A I wasnt really at home with the Tom and Jerry characters. HannaBarbera handled those characters beautifully much better than I did. Jerry was a much more charming character in their best cartoons than I could ever make him simply  because I could never understand him. And I couldnt really draw Tom very well I had to turn him into a different cat really. So I purposely said The hell with him. And I tried to keep Jerry attractive personally more like the Road Runner in that he never really hurt Tom in my version. Bill and Joes Jerry would sometimes cut Tom into slices. It became sort of halfassed with my Tom becoming a combination of the Coyote and the original Tom. Its difficult to work with someone elses characters.Chuck Jones Conversations Univ.

However cash and cash equivalents such as checks or gift cards that can be exchanged for cash must never be accepted in any amount.

When buildings share a walllot line any  window on the lot line is not considered a real window in terms of designating rooms for bedrooms and what not bedrooms require at least one window. So because a lot line window is not really a window most buildings are not constructed with windows on the lot lines since they are a waste of moneytime.It appears that because theres no building built up to share the same wall someone has gone ahead and inserted a window.

3249757,0,t1_coxral3,In general or just fasteners?The US has a different size gallon and bushel.  Because we dont use the stone our ton is  lb.On fasteners the UK never widely adopted Unified National Thread which comes in Coarse and Fine flavors so Imperial usually means Whitworth whereas standard is mostly UNC with some usage of UNF.  UNT is specified by a thread diameter and pitch threads per inch an SAE standard provides for head dimension across the flats vs thread diameter.  I cant adequately explain Whitworth but the threads are formed differently and will jam.  Also the wrenches spanners for Whitworth are specified by bolt diameter not the head.,mildlyinteresting,coyugdm,1,t5_2ti4h

I was god awful at it and I was always saved a spot as th chair Most of the song you rest and the other parts you only really need one hand. Needless to say I didnt practice ever or show my licorice stick the right amount of respect. Which makes me an expert to comment on this photo.What most likely happened Before ulysser  practiced some sort of snack or sugary substance was consumed and then transferred to the reed. ulysser may have taken a break from cranking out some wood wind magic. This ant most of been a reincarnated trombone player because it has no respect for the wood wind folks. Those who say ulysser did not properly take care of his reed and mouth piece are wrong. The reed looks no older than a week and has no molding.If you spent any time in the trenches of the rd and th chair clarinets you would truly understand what poor reed and mouth piece care looks like. Reeds that have black mold spotted on them mouth pieces with a thick white film of dried saliva. Hell we use to share reeds with the other rd and th chair folks.

Thats great and what a rare pleasure it is to find something that we connect with so good for you! However objectively speaking her books are very dry and the language isnt complex or lyrical. There isnt much character or original plot development. If you remove the powerful philosophical message in her books the language and style are mediocre and would have been forgotten a long time ago. For people with different philosophical ideas the metaphors in the book are heavy handed and relentless. The book becomes a long dry boring sermon.Just my thoughts. ,mildlyinteresting,cpkqkcs,1,t5_2ti4h

You can look her up google Becky harris Bosworth accident. She lost her left eye and had  breaks through her left femur along with a collapse lung among other things broke. They also did not bother to contact me until the next day. I found out when a friend called me to tell me how sorry she was to hear of the accident. I then contacted the hospital to be told yes she was there and in very bad condition. The drunk driver that hit her died and all she got was k that did not even cover the cost. The only upside was the awesome coffee shop they had down stairs. There are  of them but i only used the one across from the garage in the main area. The rest of the stay up there was me taking care of her and complaining nurses not doing there job. KU Med is a  hour drive. So we ruined the other vehicle we had left since her car was destroyed. We also just put a k mile engine in her car not even a month before and they offered us  bucks for it since his insurance was Geico. Please dont drink and drive.

When I told them not to they said that they didnt feel confident about the repair and wouldnt work on the timing. So I could pay the  for the spark plug bullshit or a  dollar diagnostic fee that would be waived if I let them do the repairs and still have to tow it to another shop to get the timing done.

You can get clothes that are like new or actually new for dirt cheap.  Ive bought clothes there that still had the original stores price tag on it.  Also you can find some cool old Tshirts.

FT the original sign before the metric conversion sign was added actually means  feet and  inches.People dont generally measures fractions of feet in a decimal way so the . should not be taken as a decimal point just a separator. Just like . is used to separate hours from minutes in this old page from the Radio Times  note how The Queen and the Rebels is shown as . meaning  minutes past  this used to be an acceptable notation for time in the UK at least.They commissioned the new sign to show both imperial and metric measurements but never got around to removing the original.,mildlyinteresting,cqrgsv4,1,t5_2ti4h

The act of reflectionrefraction preferentially selects light with a specific polarized alignment.As a result one can cancel or enhance polarized rainbows by rotating a polarizing filter such as in sunglasses until you either see the rainbow or it disappears entirely.In addition for the OPs example the ambient light is very bright and randomly polarized while the polarized rainbow is very faint likely due to light rainfallprecipitation.  As a result when using the sunglasses the ambient light is largely controlled while the rotation of the sunglasses is such that the rainbow is best enhanced.Source I also teach physics.,mildlyinteresting,cr3rqy6,56,t5_2ti4h

3960482,0,t3_35tnri,In an area I used to mountain bike had a trail that led along a ridge filled with old growth cedar and fir trees.A bunch of us noticed the smell of burning wood even though there were no campfires burning ban during fire season.As we made out way up to the lookout someone looked back and down and could see fine wisps of smoke coming up from one tree a massive cedar.Any how one of called the fire department as he was a volunteer with them and waited.A helicopter came out and circled the area and within  minutes the local fire department had brought up a small crew. They had to drop the tree to get it to a place where they could put it out. It was burning on the inside dry heartwood of the tree.Since this was very nice red cedar I borrowed my friends  ton and cut some single bolts from it.

3960908,0,t1_cr7qagu,I was  and had recently started experimenting with alcohol. Up to that point Id never even considered smoking a cigarette. They stunk and I knew they were horrible for your body... but the night I first tried vodka lo and behold smoking a clove cigarette seemed like a new and awesome thing to do. And it was! It gave me a huge rush of euphoria on top of already flying high on a vodka buzz. Plus as an added bonus my lips tasted like maple syrup. And I felt more mature somehow. Like a man... a man who makes his own god damn rules.For awhile it was just a thing that was fun to do while drinking. I loved to get wasted with friends but realized I couldnt do it all the time. Smoking though? I could smoke on breaks at work while driving etc. So I started smoking regularly just to get a taste of those good times during the work week. Eventually I switched to Marlboro reds I think after a friend made fun of me for smoking cloves. Smoking Marlboros was for God damned tough guys. Guys who made their own rules. Yeah I see the irony here.Anyways the euphoric rush i got from smoking started to fade until eventually I got nothing out of it. I ended up having to keep smoking  just to feel normal. If I couldnt have a smoke every couple hours Id get anxiety like a motherfucker. It became a  year addiction that made me feel like shit physically and gave me an easy way to avoid dealing with emotional issues. Just smoke them away. After ten or fifteen attempts to quit I feel like Ive finally kicked the urge to smoke. Its been months since I had one. The difference from previous attempts is that when I smell someone smoking Im no longer jealous. I used to love that smell but now it makes me feel like barfing. This is a good thing. ,mildlyinteresting,cr7rzd1,71,t5_2ti4h

4003968,0,t1_crcn608,Frogs are amphibians but survive on the principle of low energy investment in each offspring individually but massive production overall of eggs. See a species can only invest a finite amount of energy into each offspring and they have to use various strategies to ensure to the best of their ability that their investment is not a waste. Generally the strategies come down to two main categories high parental care or high numbers.High parental care This is the strategy thats most used by mammals and birds and involves producing small numbers of offspring e.g. humans producing only one or two children birds maybe  or  per clutch etc but then focusing lots of attention on them. Humans generally have approximately two children on average in firstworld countries but we then focus extremely large amounts of resources on caring for them for an extremely long relative amount of time  long past sexual maturity. Birds produce larger numbers of offspring per clutch and as such they invest less energy into each offspring but they still invest large amounts of energy over a long time on only a few chicks.High numbers These are those organisms that invest little to no energy on parental care but instead divert all energy into producing a great many offspring in the hopes that enough will survive to adulthood to replace their parents. Insects amphibians fish and similar use this method producing hundreds thousands or even millions of offspring on the understanding that almost all of them will die before reaching sexual maturity. So with some exceptions most frogs will produce massive numbers of offspring but provide minimal parental care. In a koifilled pond theyre hoping that at least two of the thousands will survive long enough to reproduce.,mildlyinteresting,crcomcp,5,t5_2ti4h

And sure doneness varies from person to person I agree.  I really was giving a specific example where my friends girlfriend likes her steak literally cooked for  minutes per side on a grill which is well beyond the point I would consider it properly cooked.Youre making it sound like Im making some outrageous argument but its really simple.  Things should be cooked to a certain point and not beyond that point or else you lose flavormoisture and the meat gets tough.  There are even many caveats to this such as smoking or cooking in a water bath especially things like tough cuts of lamb that can take  hours to cook properly.

Or they can just buy in bulk in advance.  And if you have the same hardware you can image a drive with software and drivers in minutes saving all sorts of costs. You were saying that the original hardware they used could have somehow been cheaper because linux.Are you changing your argument now to say that in the future they can make the same thing happen with more cost efficient parts?  Sure but thats common sense and theres no reason to switch OSs especially with virtual machines.  A company that size probably has plans out  years at least in the future in terms of hardware or upgrades already. Or theyll just replace the machines for a certain timeframe and retire the physical service when they transition over to full streaming.

Much faster.  All of them move in the same direction so the ones on the bottom layer move at x speed the next layer up moves at x speed the next layer up at x speed ect.  As a higher layer reaches the front of the pile they get rolled over so to speak and end up in a lower layer.  When the lower layer works reach the back of the pile they climb up to a higher layer and thus the cycle continues.So theyre clumped so they can escape the flooding faster.Edit  as for the dirt it looks like worm castings to me.

If i thought my neighbor was up to something suspicious but had no proof I do not feel that i would be within my rights to show up at his door and demand he give me a key to every lock on his property.This scenario would be like the whole town agreeing that i should be able to do so and that if he refuses to give me the keys i could remove him from his home at gunpoint take him to my house and lock him in my basement until he gives them to me. At which point i could determine if my hunch was right.I dont want to live in that town.edited people that read other peoples sincere personal thoughts on basic human issues and instead of responding with anything of their own simply choose to click a little i vote to censor this button... man you are super cool. good job.,mildlyinteresting,crx8obx,-2,t5_2ti4h

I was not talking about sexual harassment groping ogling. Its just like ufifthredditincarnati said is an epidemic and I empathize with her.There is a culture of sexual repression and victim blaming although not to the extent of islamic countries that is the primary cause of this.TL DR I was specifically talking about rape.

Any increase to the cars environmental impact by such a small subcomponent is inconsequential and the lifecycle analyses prove itAs you can see from the lifecycle analysis the overwhelming majority of any cars environmental impact hybrid or not is inflicted in operations not manufacturing.

4483475,0,t1_csvhx7h,Its why I really loved taking biology classes in college. The amount that you learn about plants and animals is jaw dropping. Here are  other cool plant facts. Photosynthesis is the process of taking CO from the air and releasing it as O. The carbon is used to synthesize water into sugar and other plant matter. Plants are not made from the soil they only use the soil to trap nutrients and water. Plants are made from the air. Some plants can detect if a neighboring plant is an intruder or kin. If it detects an intruder then it actively grows its roots to choke the nutrients out of its invading neighbors. If its a kin plant then it continues growing harmoniously with each other. Plants are very selective of what nutrients they absorb. Some even require toxic concentrations of heavy metals such as cadmium and zinc in order to grow. One plant in particular has an affinity for gold and can be used to phytomine. This plant literally mines gold for you.,mildlyinteresting,csvt35i,2,t5_2ti4h

4582144,0,t1_ct86bb6,gt The sphere traps air underneath it and the liquid above pushes down. As the sphere melts it allows air to escape which is replaced by liquid.I get this my thought was why it was replaced by liquid instead of the sphere lowering to fill the gap. But now that I think about it the air has to get out so it needs a path and it pushing up will also open a path for some juice to get through. This will start to carve a channel in the side of the sphere allowing it to continue.The only way I believe to avoid this would be to have it so symmetric that the air comes up as a ring around the whole thing but I dont think theres any practical way that this would be possible.If I had an ice press Id be tempted to try this with a plastic cup with a hole drilled in it near the bottom. That would give the air a second avenue for escape and Im curious if it would change anything.,mildlyinteresting,ct86jlt,1,t5_2ti4h

If you know a dogs anatomy and start hitting soft spots I bet theres a good chance they let up.All this is moot point because if a military or police dog is on you then there are military or police with guns right behind them.

I prefer the flatbread lately even though I realize its not freshbaked in store every morning. As long as the teenage sandwich artist can make sandwiches without crosscontamination as in getting tomatoes dropped on the lettuce earlier and then using that lettuce in your sandwich when you are allergic to tomatoes it takes pretty good for a few bucks. It costs more to go to Jimmy Johns for a smaller but better sandwich.It doesnt hurt that there are more Subway restaurants than McDonalds by a rather large margin. Its a lighter and in some cases less expensive meal than a big mac and fries. Truthfully Id take even a Quiznos sub over McDonalds but thats just me.

In the US you have to be as competitive as possible and this coupled with less tight food regulations means that its almost half the price for whats essentially the same product meat is probably very different and it cant stay out for as long from the same chain.

4926845,0,t1_cuef3oy,We used to have family dinners pretty often  anyones birthday any holiday or just for the heck of it wed go to my grandmothers house.A pretty normal meal would be a huge roast mashed potatoes brown gravy squash casserole dirty rice macaroni amp cheese real baked stuff not the garbage from the Kraft box peas or greenbeans or butterbeans and dinner rolls. Really... not so far off from a British Sunday roast.  My mothers side of the family is mostly of English and Scottish descent but so far back like th and th centuries that these are perceived as American dishes not as something from some ancestral homeland.  Funny though  in areas with a lot of German immigrants centuries ago smoked sausage and kraut would be perceived as normal American food...  thats the trick with America  from coast to coast various groups came and left their mark but they all assume that the regional culture is generic American.  When visitors see the same chain stores off the highway its easy to assume that the culture is uniform.Heres another example  my family NEVER had alcohol at family dinners.  They didnt care if you drank but it just wasnt something that happened at family dinners old school Methodists.  My inlaws would be aghast at a family dinner without a bottle of wine... and thats before even starting with the fierce arguments about Thanksgiving what should be on the table when the dinner should take place etc..,mildlyinteresting,cufkg8l,1,t5_2ti4h

5291929,0,t3_3ngstv,There are numerous Baja Sharkeez. I live near the one in Hermosa Beach and theres one in Manhattan Beach. Both within a few miles of each other those cities are only a couple square miles each.SO I will admit Im also like that sign to a degree. I like the beach atmosphere because its chill. The temperature is literally  degrees cooler than downtown LA just  miles away. The people are very relaxed. It is the beach volleyball capital of the world. That gives you an idea. The major crimes by an astronomical degree are theftwhich is almost always outsiders stealing stuff.But it is also because it has a giant beach a tourist destination. And you cant really control who comes touristing. But you can make it difficult for them. I stopped going to clubs around here not only because Im old but because it wasnt locals anymore. If I want to go to a Hollywood club I can go to Hollywood. Youd go to clubs down here because they were fun and relaxed and not all douchedup with some aggro dudes all up in your grill. Yo.But humans are tribal. We are always looking for ways to exclude others and make ourselves belong. My city with a Baja Sharkeez is  square mile. There are literally people who will hang out on one block by the beach and use those volleyball nets and surf there and will give you a hard time if you try and come in. Not like beat you silly just be less friendly.Im going to steal my neighbors anecdote. Hes a big time surfer. And his sister foolishly said that her boyfriend and brother my neighbor should go out surfing since they both did it. These guys are in their s keep in mind. The boyfriend said he couldnt go surf with my neighbor because ltrolls up sleevegt he had a tattoo that said like th Street Surf Lords or whatever.

You sit down and if someone likes you they come and sit with you can you played checkers I think the game was.  I could be mistaken.  It was just outside the common area in the school where kids go for breaks.  I was on break and watching people try it out.  Seemed like fun.  I decided to try it out.  I was not shy.  I have learned to be shy since.  Went and sat.    Nobody sat with me.   Eventually I got a tap on my shoulder by the girl who had set up the table and she asked me to go so other people could try it.    I remember how she smiled at me.  It was not the smile of oh you poor thing.  I feel bad  it was the smile of can you fucking move so the good looking normal people who i made this for can use it now please?  A girl I knew in my class decided to try and and I shit you not two guys got into a kerfuffle on who was going to sit with her.  I did because I thought I was like the rest of the kids there.  I was wrong. Way wrong.It did teach me something that I was never  sure about.  My looks.  I was never sure about what I looked like.  May be I was average.  Or more than average? But no.  I am just garden variety ugly.  Forgettable.I am ok with it now.  People like me for who I am.But  year old me did not take it very well.  I hate the fucking table.

5332085,0,t3_3nzusb,Funny things about Zimbabwe In the year  Zimbabwes government took all farm land from any farmer who was white over  farms and randomly distributed it to black people who may or may not have been farmers causing their food exports to completely disappear. In April  selfstyled war veterans led by Chenjerai Hitler Hunzvi began invading whiteowned farms. Those who did not leave voluntarily were often tortured and sometimes killed. One was forced to drink diesel fuel as a form of torture. That month Parliament pushed through an amendment taken word for word from the draft constitution that was rejected by voters allowing the seizure of whiteowned farmlands without due reimbursement or payment.  In late January  the Zimbabwean finance ministry reported that they had  in their treasury. Zimbabwe asked for  million USD to finance the  election. Zimbabwes mining exports generated m m in the first four months of . The  elections were seriously compromised with as many as one million people unable to cast their ballots. Often and frequently people approaching ballot boxes were shot with automatic weapons. Mugabe told the press If anyone is dissatisfied the courts are there. I invite Tsvangirai his competitor in the election to go to court if he has any grounds to justify what he has been saying. The nation Southern African Development Community Sadc said the vote reflected the will of the people. With all of their farms decimated Zimbabwe depended entirely on tourism for income. However poaching and deforestation have resulted in many of the landmarks people were coming to see having been destroyed. In most places in Zimbabwe there are no working toilets or running water so people are accustomed to just shitting in the street.  Catherine GrantMakokera of the South African Institute of International Affairs in Johannesburg reported that Investors are very reluctant to put more capital into Zimbabwe at the moment  and that is leading to a slowdown in growth. According to the United Nations World Health Organisation the life expectancy for men was  years and the life expectancy for women was  years of age . In   of Zimbabweans had HIV. Mugabe decided to give  ownership of foreign companies operating in Zimbabwe to the people who having no money could not afford to finance those companies. In January  Zimbabwes Reserve Bank said unemployment was .. But many others organisations such as the UN put the figure as high as . Mugabe calls himself the Hitler of this time. Mugabe owns three farms seized from their owners without compensation to provide food for himself and his clan ensuring that the decimation of the local economy and agriculture will not starve them as well. Mugabe blames food shortages on drought and the cumulative effect of sanctions imposed against the country. Mugabes wife Grace Mugabe was granted a PhD in sociology from  University of Zimbabwe two months after entering the program without presenting a thesis. The degree was granted by Robert Mugabe Chancellor  University of Zimbabwe.If you put all of that into a funnel what comes out the bottom isZimbabweans die before middle age of starvation and easily treated illnesses and diseases because the billions of dollars generated by Zimbabwes industries go directly into Robert Mugabes bank account. He commits mass murder to prevent people voting then changes the vote counts to ensure a majority preventing him from ever being taken out of office. He is blatantly racist against anyone who is not his ethnicity to the point of theft torture and more mass murder. ,mildlyinteresting,cvt8f6n,56,t5_2ti4h

That allows the film to find its relaxed state and shift to release the tension they are wound under.

You cant grip it around the outside.Also its hard to put the lid down on the table in such a way that the side which contacts the food isnt touching the table and you still can pick it up without touching the part which touches the food i.e. get PB on your hand.Also with this design the threads which are raised now prevent you getting a straight shot to the bottom of the jar because they are on the inside.Just make the jar flouted. Make the sides start less than  degrees from the bottom and constantly bend away to vertical. The sides will be concave top to bottom on the inside. If you make sure the angle is such that you can reach from the opposite site of the mouth to the wall at the bottom of the jar then you will be able to reach any point in the jar with a straight inflexible knife. And the threads and cap can still go on the outside without protruding beyond the circle formed by the bottom of the jar.So the whole thing fits within a cylinder with a bit of a narrow waist and packs nicely in boxes.,mildlyinteresting,cwj88gl,1,t5_2ti4h

While there are translations of the Quran in nearly every language to truly read what Muslims believe to be the word of God you have to read it in its original Arabic. This idea is considered to be true by Muslims for the Torah Psalms and Bible as well In order to be a Muslim you have to accept the original untranslated versions of these texts as the word of God too. However because these texts do not exist in their original forms anymore a final revelation the Quran was revealed to the final prophet Muhammad. Final because according to Islam God promised that the original Quran will remain unchanged until the day of judgment making it unnecessary for future prophets.

5630181,0,t1_cwux0lk,I used to keep a plastic yogurt container in the sink. Generally speaking I used the dishwasher but every time used the sink I rinsed soapy water off into the yogurt container. The other uses of water were collected in dry dishes sitting in the sink or used to prerinse other greasy dishes.In other words kitchen sink water was heavily reused before it even touched the drain. This helped me save on dish detergent too.Unfortunately I could not make use of other grey water but every drop helps.If you really want then you can find a big tub to store grey sink water or maybe laundry water and then use that water from the tub to pour into the toilet tank to prepare it for flushing. You would need to turn your toilet water off. At first it might be inconvenient but after a while you might get used to it.I never had the opportunity to try the latter idea though.,mildlyinteresting,cwuz7b3,2,t5_2ti4h

Then its much less likely that they can screw things up while operating a programable remote. A lot of devices support those commands even though they are not included on the devices remotes.

Each flush would replace the tank with chlorinated water which fish cannot live in very well without treatment.. Changing out a large portion of fishes tank water is detrimental to them. Most freshwater tanks should only have a  water change once a month unless other issues are present. This would be  multiple times a day.. Toilet water in the tank is pretty cold usually. This would wreck any temperature regulation you had going on in the tank and likely send the fish into shock.The good news is when all of your fish die they are a very short trip to their final resting place. ,mildlyinteresting,cwxlgpr,3,t5_2ti4h

5699990,0,t1_cx3knxw,I am about to graduate with a BS in Geography. Meteorology was one of my favorite classes. I will try to explain this briefly as I have to leave soon.As others have said you are looking at the convergence of two different temperature air masses known as a front. On the left is a warm air mass and on the right is a cold air mass. When two air masses of different temperatures meet they create a front. The temperature of the dominant and moving air mass is what determines the name of the front. The line of clouds in the OP is the front.  Warm Front  In this diagram you can see a warm front in action moving from left to right. The major rules you need to know about this is that cold air is MORE DENSE and therefore heavy while warm air is LESS DENSE and therefore light. As a result warm air masses will rise above cold air masses when they converge. Also you need to know that when moist air rises to a sufficient altitude height clouds will form. This point is where the dew point causes water to condense and form clouds. This altitude is called the condensation level.As this warm air mass advances from left to right in the diagram into a cold air mass the dense cold air stays close to the ground while the lighter and less dense warm air gets forced upwards in a wedgelike fashion.  In comparison to a cold front a warm front is much more of a gentle advance and this creates that long drawn out wedgelike rise in the warm air mass. This results in less cloud formation and generally less precipitation. Warm fronts sometimes bring light to moderate showers that can last a long time. Cold fronts are much more intense because of their increased density heavier. This causes a cold front to rapidly force all of the warm air directly up and this rapid change causes large towering cloud formations cumuluscumulonimbus clouds that cause heavy thunderstorms or snowblizzards the only difference is what temperature it is. This is why cold fronts generally bring shortlasting but intense precipitation while warm fronts generally bring longer lasting but lightmoderate precipitation if any.  TLDR Warm air is moving over cold air and gently being lifted to the point that clouds form. The line formed is the boundary of this warm front.,mildlyinteresting,cx3n0j6,10,t5_2ti4h

5755705,0,t1_cxaixlz,dude im not disagreeing with the coverages and riders just that the insurers really arent trying to NOT pay you.However they base the premiums on lots of things. Many people dont want catastrophic flood insurance so its better business to break that off as a rider rather than try to sell it to everyone. As to Act of God this is an interesting clause and varies state to state as to whats covered based on reasonableness.  For example most of the time trees falling just as floods hurricanes and tornadoes are NOT excludable as Act of God... unless normal people dont have trees or more likely the homeowner didnt buy the windhurricane policy. Because if you think about it anything natural is an act of god.Act of God would exclude for example a volcano popping up in Chicago but not a flood. since you can buy a flood rider along that flood plain. source homeowner once an actuary and once insurance agent.,mildlyinteresting,cxajt2t,2,t5_2ti4h

Those will then connect to other shafts underground which may be covered with some rotten boards and dirt. You can very easily fall down one of those and die. Another big one is bad air. You can have pockets of air with no oxygen in them in these old shafts and you wont realize anythings wrong until its too late. Also extracting people from them can be too dangerous for rescue crews in some situations.

5817234,0,t3_3uv48k,Once upon a time at the dawn of the recycling craze the Danish government decided it would be a great idea to do an experiment on getting the population to sort their trash. The experiment was made trash was sorted and the population eventually discovered that all their well intended sorting was for naught since the very same government that had asked them to sort their trash was throwing it all in the same container at the recycling centre. The people were confused and angry as to why all their hard work was undone and they stopped caring about sorting trash completely. Some months maybe even years passed and the Danish government decided to go through with their plans for garbage sorting since the experiment worked well even though it ended awkwardly. But soon they discovered that no matter what they did they could not make the Danish population sort their trash again because they refused to believe it wouldnt just be thrown in the same container just like last time. And thus ends the Danish trash sorting adventure which to this very day faces extreme difficulties. The Danish population remain sceptic and unwilling to sort more than the very basics of garbage because of an old tale of deceit and betrayal.,mildlyinteresting,cxi6kmb,3,t5_2ti4h

5909199,0,t1_cxu3in7,It must have been just after dawn when we set off from our lodging in the Cingjing Farm in Taiwan. We had arrived a day prior from Taichung on the west coast and were now headed for an obscure bampampb all the way on the opposite end of the country. We had a heck of a drive ahead through the mountains and had decided to make the most of the day by setting off as early as possible.  To tell the truth I was glad I hadnt really enjoyed the Cingjing experience because of the crowd.A few hours in the sun had completely risen as we pulled into a rest stop halfway down the mountain. It was a quaint little thing  a teahouse manned by a husband and wife and we were the only customers. The winding mountain roads had made me a little carsick and cranky at that point so you probably can imagine how welcome the tea was. The owner put on some jazz and we sat back and chatted a little.As we were preparing to leave I noticed that a fog had rolled in while we were indoors. I watched it from the deck. It was thick and silent and it had totally transformed the scenery.  The temperature had also dropped quite a bit and the air was now cold and sharp. The best thing though? No crowds. Just us and the mountain.  And in that moment everything felt alright.,mildlyinteresting,cxu88w4,5,t5_2ti4h

If I get up and go to the bathroom right now my Shepherd will copy me and do it at the same time. I didnt teach her that but she knows me going to the bathroom at night means its almost bedtime. She sleeps in my room with me and has only ever woken me up once  even when its easily  hours since shes been outside. I would never do that to her intentionally of course and she is fully aware of how to ask to go outside. She wont go to the bathroom on walks either if were going somewhere shell run to go pee before we go she picks up on things like me getting ready to leave me getting car keys grabbing a leash etc. Also when in doubt there are diapers for dogs  then you basically just have a really large baby. ,mildlyinteresting,cy34flp,9,t5_2ti4h

The world Trade Center in the heart of New York was destroyed by multiple planes in a vehicular accident.You may be thinking this is enough evidence to conclude that these redditors did  but we have to go further  is not only the day of the worst terror attack on American soil its also the American and Canadian emergency hotline. Canada and the USA both have white and red on their flags. What is reddits mascot? The livable alien named Snoo. What colors are Snoo? Hes white with red eyes. Yes we can stop here and say Snoo used Osama as a puppet to bring down America but theres more. As I said Snoo has red eyes. The Canadian flag has one red leaf. If we take off one of Snoos eyes what do we get? A one eyed alien. What else has one eye? You guessed it. The illumWait stop there. You guessed wrong. The cyclops has one eye. Pirates have one eye. Fetty Wap also has one eye. I mentioned  things that have one eye what shape has  sides and  angles? A triangle. Whats a triangle with one eye represent? Yes thats correct.

Simply having a copper roof wont necessarily increase the odds of a lightning strke but it would be wise to ensure that the roof is grounded with a suitable conductor so that if it was in fact struck the charge would follow that path to ground instead of passing through the structure underneath.  Lightning rods are designed to do this too  but in addition to conducting a lightning hit to ground they can act to dissipate charge buildups before enough potential is built up to trigger a strike in the first place.,mildlyinteresting,cymrrpl,4,t5_2ti4h

6192819,0,t1_cysy5fb,Ive eaten turkey eggs they are basically just slightly larger chicken eggs in flavor and appearance.  Why is there no big market for turkey eggs?  Turkeys are worth more for meat than for egg laying and while we have a shit load of turkeys its nowhere near the completely INSANE amount of chickens we have especially on a global level.  Turkeys due to there size and physical requirements and less than ideal for full on factory farm egg production.  So basically a turkey egg offers nothing a chicken egg doesnt while also having a decent deal of issues to go with it economically.  Im sure you could get some jackoffs in Portland to eat turkey eggs as a higher quality natural egg free of the terrors of chicken egg production if you could get them off there vegan diets but most people would just go chicken eggs are a dollar cheaper per dozen fuck those turkey eggs! and that would be that.  ,mildlyinteresting,cytk3uq,1,t5_2ti4h

Roads can be very shit in some places.Textiles and etc do cause death usually in their production almost hardly ever as a direct end result the use of their product by their customers. Tobacco cant say the same. Smoking will  of the time have to account for acts of god and drunk drivers end your life faster than if you hadnt smoked.Not sure about the clove cigarettes it may be that they arent regulated but are banned from sale.

I was noticeably swollen for about six months though not extremely the whole time and looking back at picture up to  months later I can still see that my face was puffy. It took about six months to a year to get feeling in the top part of my face and several years for the feeling around my mouth to normalize. I still have dulled feeling in my chin and lip but honestly I would trade it again and again for the improvement in life I have.

6326876,0,t1_cz8gpv3,In my case I have a skeletal open bite an occlusal plane of deg and a mandibular plane angle of deg. And my teeth have been destroyed by reflux and bruxism from sleep apnea I was repeatedly told it was stress. While I see your point I also dont see how a textbook case like mine also goes unnoticed. The orthodontist in my city who does the most adult surgeries recently looked at me and described my case as very routine. Two others reacted the same way in addition to all my general dentists and childhood orthodontist. The only explanation I can come up with for this oversight is that these people are no better at detecting poor facial growth patterns than the general population. By contrast Im sure theyd have noticed an underbite overbite or gummy smile as would I.Its not true that long faces have no functional impairments theyre just reported to other specialists and because no one thinks to mention it to their dentist it only appears that way. My occlusal plane was so steep for example that it was blocking my Eustachian tubes making flying very painful. I used to get fluid every time thatd take weeks to drain. TMD can cause all kinds of problems and its etiology is often rooted in skeletal problems. Sleep apnea would be the worst offender with all kinds of unexpected associations.I see your points about how clinicians are sensitive about it though. I probably would be too in your shoes.I have a question about growth patterns though. Long face syndrome is fairly easy to recognize once you know what to look for. Are people without open bites but with out of bound planes still considered long face? I also see people with normal morphology but generally undersized faces. I dont even know if that can be called a growth pattern but if it is what do you call it and whats the general etiology? Id assume just a mixed bag of lack of sleep malnutrition minor mouth breathing frequent infections etc?,mildlyinteresting,cz8sp5l,1,t5_2ti4h

I am in favor of a livable minimum wage and i understand that in the food industry that means increased menu prices.  Thats fine with me but I dont expect everybody to agree.Also remember the hr is only for the slow hours.  The rush hours have a much higher tip rate also corresponding to much higher effort put into hard work during busy hours! so that the average comes out to a median of hr including unreported tips.I think that while tipping is the dominant restaurant culture in the US the current rules are fair but the numbers have fallen behind inflation and the min. wage needs to gradually increase to something more reasonable.

6389930,0,t1_czfw99f,This is just from personal experienceopinion The best drugs to do are ones that allow for more emphatic connections with other people or allow you to see things from a different perspective. Not ones that sort of just draw you into your own body or feel good or numbing.Drugs are a way to get to know yourself but you should also know yourself fairly well if you are going to experiment with drugs. So it is a sort of catch . The keys are  learn about drugs from someone who you admire who uses them. Someone responsible who you wouldnt mind being more like someone who seems smart and has their shit together. The second key is set and setting. You need to be in the right environment and be in the right state of mind.That saidAlcohol I think it is a good idea for secondary are kids to have a wine cooler with dinner when they eat with their parents. Most alcohol abuse in youths happens due to being sort of a dog let loose to run free. If parents would teach that drugs of which alcohol is one can be beneficial if used in moderation there would be a lot less problems. Parents should monitor the childs behavior guide them on what they are feeling and how to control their behavior while still enjoying the experience of being more social and relaxed etc. a drink or two at dinner a few times a week actually getting drunk  to  drinks at cocktail parties teaching them how to get drunk and taper off before getting to drunk. A lot of people drink so it is possible to get a good guide to alcohol but it is also a very dangerous drug so it takes a lot of training to use it right....a lot of people never get it and become alcoholic unfortunately. Personally In my late s I have one or two drinks about twice a week and maybe five to once every three to  months. It is not my favorite drug but it totally can be fun and used safely. Cannabis Similar to alcohol but I would suggest starting a little bit later. Cannabis is great for alternative insight enhancing sex social interaction making moving your body more enjoyable dance and all around feeling great. But it takes work to learn how to get very high and not look silly. Personally it is once a week drug for me and I like to get really high it is like a relaxation message for my brain. I always wake up feeling refreshed after a long week of hard work. Some people enjoy light daily use but that is not for me. I only get properly messed up once a week with only this drug because it is the only one with a  recovery by the next day for me. Although some people still feel groggy the next day. Mushrooms Having a well versed guide is absolutely critical You will gain a lot of insight that is hard to explain if you havent tried it. But I can say that the clarity that I feel the next day after last with me for about a year or so. It feels like my mind has been cleaned up and all of the old junk has been thrown out. I only trip about once a year. Also I suggest waiting a little bit longer before trying mushrooms maybe even above age . I think you need a pretty firm grasp of yourself and a relaxed ego. Failure to have those things can cause people to have really bad trips or so I hear.LSD Similar to Mushrooms but different. Also everything I said about a guide above is important. Note testing your LSD is a pain in the ass and a dose of fake LSD is a terrible thing to take. I would try it about once a year but due to the difficulty obtaining it I only do it every few years.MDMA My favorite drug period. with exception to the drug god caffeine which I am not even mentioning here. Because of the way it depletes your serotonin you should have at least wait a month in between your rolls. Ideally not having more than  or  in a year.MDMA is hypertherapeutic and there is still a lot of research that needs to be done on it. But if done with the right people in the right mindset it can be an amazing experience. The increased sense of empathy you feel for literally everyone is almost a religious experience. Everyone has different but similar experiences and it is hard to put into words but Ill try my best.I feel fully at home with my body the way you feel after sex when you are naked with someone you love. I feel fully accepting of myself and aware of what I want to change about myself without judgement it jump started my path into fitness. I feel  kind to everyone I met and interested in learning about them and celebrating our differences. Not to mention your body physically feels better than it ever does. I could go on and on needless to say I like it.This guy knows a lot about all kinds of drugs and gives very educated and safe advice. I highly suggest his channel. Moderation is key to getting maximum enjoyment out of everything so just explore the world and your mind with care. Cheers  Edit sorry if that post sounds a little paternalistic. I have no clue how old you are but I wrote it as if you were an inquisitive teenager with ignorant parents because you never know.

6423751,0,t1_czjenix,The glass must have has some tension from the manufacturing process. With highquality glass they do a process called tempering which heats the glass to just below the melting point well just below the glass transition point technically which is where it starts become soft which allows it to rearrange its christal structure and heal defects alleviating that kind of stress. Since this looks like a cheap pressed glass they likely didnt do that here and just left it as is. And as it happened OPs glass got a small scratch somehow at the bottom of the missing piece the stress found an outlet and a stress fracture formed. It could go in any direction but as chance would have it here it curved up and in on both sides meeting at the top in such a way that it ended the fracture progession. Add a little change in ambient temperature to make the glass contract or expand a little as a whole and pop the piece falls out. For an extreme example of prestressed glass fracturing have a look at Prince Ruperts Drops.,mildlyinteresting,czjr3o5,1,t5_2ti4h

6828709,0,t1_d0pulu1,Weird thats about how old my cat was when we got her. Her original owners abandoned her on the street and she was alone for a while. She mustve had a hell of a mother before that because she was well taught in survival. Based on her complete obsession with eating every bug she could find we think thats how she survived while she was alone. I say all this because she despite this is very conservative with her food and she is the spitting image of a healthy weight. I guess the source of foodbugs that she found may have been the difference?Meanwhile Ive had my other cat since his birth. Never gone truly hungry in his life so if he goes  hours without eating he thinks its the end of the world. I have to get super creative to keep his weight down.In comparison a local feral cat likes to hang around my house. Sometimes hell show up with a freshly bleeding injury from some fight he lets me treat him and I give him a little food to help him heal. He scarfs that food down like he hasnt eaten in a week even during his good seasons where hes a more bulky weight and Ive seen him eating plenty at the time. If I had to guess that mindset is what keeps him alive bulking up whenever he can for a rainy dayor month.,mildlyinteresting,d0qc1od,1,t5_2ti4h

Aluminum sheet with a wood lining with a light oil or grease lube.Add a magnetic hook on the back side to attach your lever to and then add a thin layer of non magnetic material to the active face.

7391626,0,t1_d2i9qv3,Wikipedia saysThe attainment of high efficiency in blue LEDs was quickly followed by the development of the firstwhite LED. In this device aYAlOCe known as YAG phosphor coating on the emitter absorbs some of the blue emission and produces yellow light throughfluorescence. The combination of that yellow with remaining blue light appears white to the eye. However using differentphosphorsfluorescent materials it also became possible to instead produce green and red light through fluorescence. The resulting mixture of red green and blue is not only perceived by humans as white light but is superior for illumination in terms ofcolor rendering whereas one cannot appreciate the color of red or green objects illuminated only by the yellow and remaining blue wavelengths from the YAG phosphor.,mildlyinteresting,d2idm4s,1,t5_2ti4h

The buildings that were talking about are buildings inside buildings with reinforced concrete walls of around  feet thickness. You could maybe sabotage the systems for hydrogen gas management. I think it was hydrogen gas that caused the chernobyl explosion. But levels of hydrogen are managed pretty carefully with lots of safeguards. You would have to sabotage all of the safeguards too.I know that if you could get all the radioactive crap into the air you could really cause a ridiculous amount of panic especially with the plants close to the cities. Im just wondering if a conventional terrorist plan wouldnt be more likely to create a relatively small containment issue and cause the unit to be damaged beyond repair. No panic no running down pedestrians no mutant zombies...I guess you could fly a  in there. That would probably do it.

Water will still be an issue but stumps can last a long time if theyre just getting wet.  Its when they are hollow and have excessive contact with soil that they break down really fast.You could take the bonsai out of the stump and replant.  bonsai trees should be OK with being transplanted since you manage the root balls fairly frequently anyway. ,mildlyinteresting,d34wgmc,1,t5_2ti4h

Im in the left of the  exit lanes and someone flies up past all the traffic and attempts to merge in front of me. Now usually Im fairly reasonable but today I was running late and I already let one person by. So anyway I make sure this guy cant merge in front of me. The guy then proceeds to drive down the shoulder still attempting to merge in front of me at every opportunity. Slightly up the road on the shoulder is a cop who had pulled someone else over but they were no longer there. This guy is now fighting me tooth and nail to get in before he runs out of road to the cop car. The cop sees him and just flags him down without moving the car. I watched the cop write up something and bring it to him. It was glorious.

The danger of this thinking in my opinion is in the conclusions it can eventually justify. Imagine for example that there was statistical evidence that the presence of some subculture detracts from the economic wellbeing of a country. Would that justify the expulsion subjugation or  god forbid  the genocide of that subculture? I dont think Im falling down a slippery slope here either because Im not suggesting that my extreme example has to be the final conclusion just that this style of math and science gives us all answers thinking can engender a dangerous disregard for our common humanity.

7963774,0,t1_d4b59wf,Some policy makers were really desperate for a standardized badging system back then and a good number of people were advocating this method. It was supposed to be less intrusive and more difficult to forge. Since only a handful of artisans around the nation would receive Federal certification each grain could be tracked to an individual shop and those shops were responsible for keeping track of all their work. The problem is that the shops were monitored at the state level and many conservative leaning legislative bodies were vehemently opposed to the program in its entirety. As a result these watchdog agencies  normally referred to as a Regional Identity Certification Enterprise were being systematically defunded by the time G.W. Bush was elected. The artisan shops in most malls went under. It was more profitable for the mall to set up stands selling cheap cell phone accessories than it was to have an unenforceable government program eating up floor space.,mildlyinteresting,d4b7d24,15,t5_2ti4h

Octane was introduced to gasoline to replace lead which makes the gasoline less volatile and keeps the gasoline from prematurely detonating in the cylinder.  If your car doesnt knock or ping on the lower grade thats all you need.  The higher octane is for hot running engines like in performance cars.  Also be sure to run fuel injector cleaner in your tank every  miles or so.,mildlyinteresting,d4p5ae2,1,t5_2ti4h

8163355,0,t1_d4xswbq,I think I can handle most of it in this one long winded post.       I was a very small solo operator. This was over  years ago and did it every year for  or  years.   I would have somewhere between  and  wholesale cost in inventory and would make frequent trips to the wholesaler for top ups.   If I had  in my pocket and  worth of fireworks left over Id call it a reasonable success.    My worst year I only cleared a couple hundred profit at a not so good location.  My best years I made a  grand and had a heap of fireworks left over to shoot myself.     Its all about location and the absolute hardest thing to do is get people out of their cars.    People only seem to stop for beer gas and cigarettes.  My best year was when I was attached to a convenience store.     It also matters what day of the week the th falls on.   Saturday is of course the ideal scenario.    Some years if the th was mid week I wouldnt bother.   Markup is bigger the smaller the item.   I would usually take my cost into a calculator and multiply times . and then round up.   The extremely big multi shot  gram aerials would cost about  at the wholesale level and sell for . So more like regular retail margins on that stuff.    A gross of lower tier brand bottle rockets like Moon Travelers cost . wholesale at the time.    The stands that are selling them for . or a dollar are truly selling them at cost or a loss as a draw so they can make it up on other items.   Same thing with Roman Candles.  The promo roman candles are often at cost.   It was generally worthwhile and is only about a . week event from start to finish  but it is some long days of sitting and watching cars go by in some very hot heat often with very few customers till the evening. Many people would ask where is the good stuff like the under the table stuff?  I dont think they really expected an operator to be selling real ms or similar but they always thought they were amusing by asking.    People tell you their firework stories all day long.    Usually about something that happened with an m way back in the day.   nd most favorite story was a group at the beach shooting fireworks and when they got back to their car late they realized they had locked the keys in it.    Pre cell phone days and no rocks or tools around they decided to sacrifice one window with an m to gain access.     They of course blew every single window out and had to drive home like that.   st most favorite story was a real old timer describing when he was a kid they got in a tree in the middle of the town square and sent ms in random directions with a slingshot for hours and caused much pandemonium in this small town and then slipped away quietly.       ,mildlyinteresting,d4xyubc,2,t5_2ti4h

The stuff about surrendering yourself to godjesus because you are worthless is nonsense. ,mildlyinteresting,d59l49f,1,t5_2ti4h

Think about how many things can go wrong constantly having a loaded weapon in your possession an accidental discharge using it accidentally in a moment of confusion having police or another carrier mistake you for an aggressor using it regretfully in a moment of passion having someone overpower you and take the weaponNow think about how many times the scenario you just described happens. It for sure describes less than  per year in the US probably far less. Meanwhile there are  deaths per year from accidental discharge not to even touch on the other issues I mentioned above or even just the added responsibility that you have to take on at all times by being a carrier.Im not trying to even discuss the legality of it just the practicality of it. I love me a day at the range in a controlled environment where safety precautions are taken by everyone present but carrying on a regular basis just isnt worth it to me on several levels. And honestly the mindset of some open carrier activists who are openly confrontational and often intentionally escalate tensions just makes it a group I dont want to associate with.,mildlyinteresting,d5ck15m,0,t5_2ti4h

Pizza topping with pepperoni seasoning is allowed because the mix is seasoned with the same spices youd find in a true pepperoni.Think of it this way Your local ice cream parlor is run by a pedantic asshole.

8369936,0,t3_4u94a5,Freedom of the press is an invaluable part of a democratic society. Many liberal nations allow free exchange of information without restrictions. Over the recent years a decline in press freedom was reported by international organizations in Turkey. Violation of international human rights and Article  of the European Convention on Human Rights in Turkey is one of the prime reasons of investigation. In this research twentytwo journalists were interviewed to extract information on the freedom of the press in Turkey. The data was analysed using triangulation. The results indicate a growing dissident of the journalists union in Turkey due to the lack of reporting freedom on critical issues such as politics religion and terrorism. Reports also suggest a global backsliding of the government to fulfil its promises of democratizing the country. The findings of this paper match with the observations of international whistleblower organizations such as Amnesty International Reporters without Borders and Committee to Protect Journalists CPJ.,mildlyinteresting,d5nsizn,1,t5_2ti4h

8412255,0,t1_d5sykby,gtKudzu kills or damages other plants by smothering them under a blanket of leaves encompassing tree trunks breaking branches or even uprooting entire trees. Kudzus ability to grow quickly survive in areas of low nitrogen availability and acquire resources quickly allows it to outcompete native species. Of the plants that can successfully compete with kudzu many are other invasive species such as the Chinese privet and the Japanese honeysuckle. In the southeast the spread of kudzu is especially troublesome because of the high level of biodiversity in this region that is not found in other regions of the United States. Kudzu and other invasive weeds pose a significant threat to the biodiversity in the southeast. They reduce the environment to impoverished vine barrens. The fast growth and high competitive ability is achieved through several key features of kudzu that are detailed below.,mildlyinteresting,d5t2qo6,2,t5_2ti4h

Apparently I had randomly stuck my leg out and my roommates started laughing at me till they realized what was going on and called .

But duh of course less intelligent people are more likely to be poor but that does not mean that all unintelligent people are poor or that all poor people are unintelligent.

Out of  men with single whorls . percent had counterclockwise whorls. This was a higher proportion than the . percent counterclockwise he counted in  men from malls stores and the beach at Atlantic City most of whom would be straight. This result got a lot of attention in the popular press France  and is mentioned on a lot of web pages about gaydar. However two more rigorous studies did not find a significant difference between gay and straight men in the proportion of counterclockwise whorls. Rahman et al.  and Schwartz et al.  separated gay and straight men based on a questionnaire not which beach they went to and determined their whorl type based on close examination not from a distance. Rahman et al.  found  percent of gay and  percent of straight men to have counterclockwise whorls while Schwartz et al.  found . percent in gay men and . percent in straight men. In both studies the observer determined whether the whorl was clockwise or counterclockwise without knowing whether the subject was gay or straight which may be an important difference between these studies and that of Klar .,mildlyinteresting,d7eou0z,1,t5_2ti4h

8921374,0,t1_d7jv3ht,Sorry for the wall of text TLDR at end. Had a really bad experience like this on my last flight. Ended up in C boarding group through some booking snaffu through my work. No big deal really I am generally a patient person and dont mind being stuck in a middle seat if it means I get where I need to be ontime. Eventually I get into the plane and find the first overhead space with a seat associated to it about  rows in. Quickly throw my bag up there and grab the middle seat to get out of the aisle. This is a small bag too put up on its side it is about  inches wide in the overhead space not like the ones you have to put in long ways that take up half a bin alone. I then proceed to get my audiobookon so as to ignore my surroundings for the next  hours. About  minutes later plane almost full I hear some yelling and commotion. I look up. A business woman about  rows forward is yelling that someone took her overhead bin space. She is yelling for the flight attendants to help her and she is pointing in the direction of the bin over my head. Meanwhile this commotion is blocking the aisle for the remaining people trying to board the plane. Her and a flight attendant make it back to where my row is and starts tapping on my bag and bitching to the flight attendant that this bag took the place where her purse was! Now I am really thinking to myself is this woman out of her mind? My bag has been there for a while and I didnt move anything to fit it in there. I take off my headphones and politely ask if there is a problem with my bag. She proceeds to curse me out directly saying that I took her spot in the bin and demands this be corrected. I calmly tried to explain that I had been in my seat for sometime now and that there were no items in that spot when I boarded the plane. This made her even more belligerent she apparently was with Business Class boarding and had put her purse there when she first boarded the plane. She then later got back up to retrieve her purse and get items out of it and as she claimed she was waiting until boarding was finished to put it back in that spot because she didnt want to block the aisle AGAIN While at this moment she is doing exactly that. She went on to tell the flight attendent that she would be filing a complaint and that she expected compensation for this mishap. At this point I was planning to see this through there was no way I felt that I was in the wrong on this and had no intentions of relocating my perfectly placed bag. I could see in the flight attendents face that he was getting pretty upset at this situation. I got the impression that he no longer wanted to deal with this and that me moving my bag would be his easiest recourse for calming this woman down. Which is exactly what he does he politely asks me to move my bag so that they can finish boarding the plane. I tell him to go ahead and move it where ever he likes even check it if he must. He returns some seemingly scripted speech about not handling bags and that I would have to move it myself. Now I am getting pissed off which is rare for me. I had to crawl my happy ass out of a middle seat and move my bag to the next nearest open spot which at this point is about  rows behind the row I am in. The flight attendent apologized to me immediately which was enough to return my state back to calm. At least someone else realizes how ridiculous this is. He gave me one free drink which was nice of him. The woman however demanded multiple free drinks and extra stuff from the flight attendents the entire flight. When it came time to get off the plane she also held up everyone behind her row to the back of the plane. She forced herself the  rows back from hers to retrieve her purse instead of waiting for a few more rows to clear out behind her. I was overit at this point let the guy next to me clear out and I went back to sitting in my seat until most of the plane was clear so that I could retrieve my back  rows back. The flight attendent apologized to me again on the way out he mentioned that another flight attendent told me they have had negative encounters with that woman before. Makes me wonder if she has acted like that on multiple occassions at what point will the aireline ban her from flying with them?TLDR Some crazy woman claimed I took her bin space  rows behind her seat about  minutes after my bag had been in the bin already. Ended up having to move my bag to calm her tits. She proceeded to be a bitch to the staff and everyone around her the entire flight. Her tits are not calm to this day.,mildlyinteresting,d7k7vk7,6,t5_2ti4h

8982606,0,t1_d7rihv0,Every single economic system that has ever been tried has some kind of management position. Were a tribal species we naturally gravitate towards leadership and hierarchy. The working class cannot manage production on their own because managing production is a skill unto itself that people need to be trained to do. When production is mismanaged we dont merely see a reduction in profits we have famine. Reliable management is absolutely invaluable because without it we die. This idea that managers are a parasitic class is what lead to disasters like The Great Leap Forward. We are not huntergatherers anymore there being some kind of management class is a simple reality of specialization of labor.,mildlyinteresting,d7rkl4t,-5,t5_2ti4h

9053821,0,t3_547z8f,When I studied animation I was told there was a game that artists from Digital Domain played where they would go to a movie and make a list of every mistake they saw in CGI scenes.

This is what companies get when they hire cheap small studios to do their ads on a tight time line.To be honest however and after having doing work in the field my guess is that the client for whole foods was saying things like No I think these people should go here make them smaller so the store is more visible  and move this here we need a bigger shadow here blah blah.

An example for upcycling could be melting down cans refining the melt and then producing airplane frames while recycling of the cans would skip the refining step and then produce a bicycle frame. An then there is downcycling where the materials of a waste product are still used rather than fully scrapped but the product is low quality.

9230734,0,t1_d8lwhzk,Thats not supported by contemporary accounts of what happened. Hamiltons pistols were built with hair trigger toggles both of them but theres no evidence Hamilton used that feature or that he intended to kill Burr but missed. No one knows for absolute certain what happened because both seconds and all others present turned their backs until shots were fired. Hamiltons letter stated that he would intentionally throw away his shot but some historians argue this was done to ensure Burrs reputation was permanently ruined if Hamilton died if not the letter would never be read. So there are enough doubts and ulterior motives that no one knows what Hamilton did or didnt do or what his intention was. He had participated in ten duels and hadnt shot in any of them before this.The one thing we can say for certain is that Burr intended to kill Hamilton and succeeded in that endeavor. The appeal of exonerating Burr seems to be solely about a desire to be some kind of insider who knows the truth denied to the peasants  all of Hamiltons criticisms of Burr were accurate and Burr had very few redeeming qualities dying in obscurity after fleeing the country for a time following credible treason charges.,mildlyinteresting,d8m2a35,2,t5_2ti4h

As for Medicare my point was that they both involve being paid into by payroll taxes to support a large generational group Boomers that didnt pay enough into the system to support themselves. I think Kickstarter is a terrible comparison because you can you know choose what to support.        As for a compromise between Dems and Repubs with Medicare whats wrong with what I said before? Medicare already makes contracts with payers why not just change the contract system to benefitspayoutstax breaks? Its perfect for conservatives covers the same ground for liberals and actually allows for dynamic expansion and contraction of the system as needed.

9359861,1,t1_d92eprw,So there are  two parts to your question. First will the washing machine render the bullets inert and second will the dryer set them off if not?If the gunpowder inside the cartridge gets wet then that will essentially ruin them at least for a while. However merely submerging them isnt enough to get the powder wet. Even being agitated in the washer wont necessarily stop them from being fire able they may be temporarily too wet but are designed to dry out and still fireSo yes they are still able to go off when they go in the dryer. Will they go off? Probably not...The raw heat of the dryer is a threat. Still it takes some extremely high temperatures to set off gunpowder without an actual spark and that would melt your clothes so thats not happening. note the mythbusters have checked to see what temperatures will set off bullets,mildlyinteresting,d92fhnh,-2,t5_2ti4h

9483572,0,t1_d9i1n8f,So yeah AV hugely increases tally workload. Its job is to simulate an array of elections in one voting session in fact its often referred to as Instant RunOff Voting.As for the logistics of counting AV theres always going to be some compromise made with vote tallying. You can elect to do it mechanically which has problems. Or you can elect to do it manually which has problems. Thats about it. I cant think of any other valid solutions to the tally problem and both are pretty weak in confidence. This isnt unique to AV though and applies to ALL voting methodologies including FPTP. Its just compounded by the fact that AV has multiple votes per person up to nx where x is the number of candidates running for the position in any given election and n is the number of applicable voters as opposed to just n or more precisely n for FPTP. nx gets even larger if you allow voters to writein candidates as well becoming nxw where w is the number of allowed writeins I imagine if allowed then w  BUT! Keep in mind your votes only get retallied if your preferred candidate loses. Then it moves your vote to your next preferred candidate. Technically AV can require just as little work to tally votes as FPTP since the minimum range of AV is n either everyone voted only once FPTP in AV or everyone voted for the winning candidate as their first pick but is incredibly unlikely. Rinse and repeat until you are out of votes your candidates all lost v lt x or you voted for the winner One of your candidates won v lt x Where v is the number of votes you cast. I like to think of AV like a game of chance you can always win P Almost like a game of roulette where you break even every time if you bet identically on every number. If you vote for every candidate you can never lose! The only thing that loses is your priority preference. ,mildlyinteresting,d9i1yp7,23,t5_2ti4h

This is the kind of backwards thinking that causes people to overlook potential opportunities to curb this terrible behavior. Yeah its not the typical approach but that doesnt mean its automatically not effective.Itd be easier to imagine an abusive person wouldnt respond to this because they are so different than us but the fact of the matter is theyre human beings who care about things like their job and their reputation. Now I agree with some of what TokenMartian said about it not being a very good poster on first glance but maybe the creators had some research about the audience that I dont have access to I dont know.

Once or twice a day the display coolers go through a defrost where instead of pumping cold air it pumps warm air for about a minute or two to make certain there is no build up in ice near the back of it It cools the entire case from the backso to reach the front it needs to cool a little more than your fridge other possibilities are if ice built up and stopped the cooler flow concentrating more cold to a particular area or this particular egg case was placed above the load limit near the back it may have frozen it as well.Source Ive worked for a grocery chain for  years  Ive seen this type of thing at least  times and that is why it happens,mildlyinteresting,dahbvi1,1,t5_2ti4h

Okay... first of all youre exposed to poop particles all the time. Youre not going to get sick by touching a poop particle. You can use a paper towel to avoid touching a bathroom door handle but what about the door handle after that one? Poopy hands dont go away after one door handle. And how often do you wipe down your credit cards? Cell phone? TV remote? I can almost guarantee that youre exposed to other peoples fecal matter on the regular. Second of all its really not that common to get sick from touching germs. What makes you sick is when you ingest those germs. As in touching inside your mouth without washing your hands. Or someone sneezing on you and you breathe in their germs.

Take MKULTRA and other programs... imagine if the project survived all the way into .gtAlthough the CIA insists that MKUltratype experiments have been abandoned some CIA observers say there is little reason to believe it does not continue today under a different set of acronyms. Victor Marchetti author and year CIA veteran stated in various interviews that the CIA routinely conducted disinformation campaigns and that CIA mind control research continued. In a  interview Marchetti specifically called the CIA claim that MKUltra was abandoned a cover story.gtIn  with funding from a CIA front organization Donald Ewen Camerons experiments were designed to first depattern individuals erasing their minds and memoriesreducing them to the mental level of an infantand then to rebuild their personality in a manner of his choosing. To achieve this Cameron placed patients under his care into druginduced comas for up to  days and applied numerous high voltage electric shocks to them over the course of weeks or months often administering up to  shocks per person. He would then perform what he called psychic driving experiments on the subjects where he would repetitively play recorded statements such as You are a good wife and mother and people enjoy your company through speakers he had implanted into blackedout football helmets that he bound to the heads of the test subjects for sensory deprivation purposes. The patients could do nothing but listen to these messages played for  hours a day for weeks at a time. In one case Cameron forced a person to listen to a message nonstop for  days.gtImmediately after World War II researchers at Vanderbilt University gave  pregnant mothers in Tennessee what they were told were vitamin drinks that would improve the health of their babies. The mixtures contained radioactive iron and the researchers were determining how fast the radioisotope crossed into the placenta. At least three children are known to have died from the experiments from cancers and leukemia. Four of the womens babies died from cancers as a result of the experiments and the women experienced rashes bruises anemia hairtooth loss and cancergtFrom  to  at the Walter E. Fernald State School in Massachusetts in an experiment sponsored by the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission and the Quaker Oats corporation  mentally disabled children were fed oatmeal containing radioactive calcium and other radioisotopes in order to track how nutrients were digested. The children were not told that they were being fed radioactive chemicals they were told by hospital staff and researchers that they were joining a science clubgtFrom  to  U.S. scientific researchers in Guatemala injected hundreds of mental patients with gonorrhea and syphilisclaiming they were being given vaccinesand encouraged many of them to pass the disease on to others.gtIn the Tuskegee syphilis experiment from  to  the United States Public Health Service contracted with the Tuskegee Institute for a longterm study of syphilis. During the study more than  AfricanAmerican men were studied who were not told they had syphilis. In an effort to better understand the disease researchers denied the men access to the known treatment of the antibiotic penicillin.,mildlyinteresting,db14ykn,511,t5_2ti4h

9945361,0,t3_5hyb7e,One of my childhood friends owns the tire shop in the small town I grew up in. Hethe shop is pretty awesome and I will will schedule my oil changes for friday at  pm so we can sit around and bullshitdrink beer after they close at  pm. Anyway theyve got a jar where they collect stuff that has been found in tires when theyve been brought in to repair. Off the top of my head the best is a deer antler that is maybe  inches long and has two tines separate antlers. There is also an unfired bullet a large caliber maybe  . inches?. They also have a big ball made up of stickers that they take off of the new tires. Its probably like  feet wide by now. The best thing was when I came in there and they had a sex swing set up in the back where they do all of the oil changes. I guess that the funny tire salesman had got it for them as a christmas joke. They got a lot of mileage out of that one.,mildlyinteresting,db3wloz,3,t5_2ti4h

Are you telling me that cuntstains who buy into this bs of brand whoring actually use them until they wear out? Im sorry the only way you would do that is if youre poor and they were the one purchase you treated yourself to but now that they are a few seasons old they need to be replaced or your uppity friends will start to wonder if the stock markets have turned against you. You see built better for more is only an argument you can make if you always wear thing until their worn out not out of fashion. So the fact that I can have  pairs of flip flops to your one at which point I am changing styles or colours? Tell me for one goddamn second that your chihuahua isnt going to chew them in that time and that you will wear those pieces of shit for  decades? Your full of shit so why dont you dismount you arrogant cunt and just say the truth I like shiny expensive things and can afford it at least Id have to respect that as its your decision.

Homogenization makes the milk fats evenly dispersed through the liquid rather than the cream rising to the top you get with unhomogenized milk. There are a few different types of pasteurization too that have different impacts on the milk. If you live within  miles of dairies find a grass fed milk that is vat pasteurized also called LTLTlow temp long time and nonhomogenized. Good milk is unbelievably good.

10017786,0,t1_dbdcc0q,Ill never forget my first encounter. I was sitting in my bed in the dark when I felt something crawl up my thigh. This was prestinkbug days so I instinctively smacked the fuck out of that critter. I was immediately horrified by how awful that smelled and somehow I had myself convinced that I had killed a wasp. Because nothing could smell as disgusting angry as hateful and rage filled as that other than a yellow jacket. It was the only logical conclusion I could come to in my postnap haze. Ah I miss the days when you could just punch the living daylights out of a bug without any recompense. Then a few months later I started to see swarms of stinkbugs in my room. I always found it so fucking creepy that they would just huddle together on your wall staring at you. It took me a looong time to finally figure out how to kill them without the smell. Throwing them in a bottle filled with water would still release that smell one way or another. I had just given up and settled for using a piece of paper to throw them out of the window. However that just wasnt satisfying enough. So one night I had become fed up thinking about the fact that I couldnt use my goddamn phone in the dark. So I picked up an empty water bottle and threw all these fuckers in that bottle. The first time I had actually wanted to see MORE stinkbugs for maximum suffering. I filled that bitch up with bleach. It was the most liberating moment of my poststinkbug infestation era. Did they really come from China? Wtf. ,mildlyinteresting,dbdcgos,1,t5_2ti4h

10156518,0,t1_dbv20am,The reason you are not getting an exact answer is that it is impossible to know exactly without knowing more about the mug.  If it is made out of a carved Cow Pelvis then it will react differently than semitreated nuclear waste.  Most likely it is a type of plastic that contains a nonmicrowavesafe hardener... like metal flake.  Metal flake which could be preferentially excited by the microwave frequency and locally melting the plastic.  Melted plastic is not as dangerous as running with scissors but it is not safe to inhale released fumes nor imbibe other petrochemical by products.  It could also not be that.  It could be Titanium Oxide used to whiten the glaze.  It could be a voodoo curse.  I dont know anything about the mug other than it is was white holds held coffee and microwaves poorly or well if mysterious poison bubbles are your jam.,mildlyinteresting,dbvaq8k,12,t5_2ti4h

Its so much easier to help a kid use the bathroom when you can easily close the door and maneuver to reach their bottom.  Ive occasionally used the handicap stall to breastfeed when there are no better options because I can stand in privacy without the baby touching anything gross.  I also make sure to take care of business and leave promptly while being mindful if anyone is waiting for a turn which is a good policy for using any public toilet.Edit  I also forgot to add that some places place the fold out changing table in the handicap stall.  If theres no changing table there is room on the floor of the larger stall to lay out my travel mat without blocking the way for other people.,mildlyinteresting,dbw2rdy,53,t5_2ti4h

10163853,0,t3_5lgrna,I once ate at a restaurant where the eating area was outside and handicapped parking spots were close to the tables.  A young guy I would say approximately  years old and  of his friends parked in one of the handicapped spots with a handicapped hang tag in the window.  They walked out of the car and looked like perfectly healthy people.  An older guy probably in his early s got up from his table and walked to the car and put his face right up to the window looking at the hang tag and to the guy who parked his car there.  The old guy also had a disgustedjudgemental look on his face.  The younger guy asked if he could help him and the older guy said did you steal that tag?! And the younger guy replied I was born with bad lungs I cant walk far distances call the police if you want.  I was glad I was able to witness it only to see how well the younger guy stood up for himself and how big of an ass the older guy made himself out to be.

I always give mine a generous rub with sea salt both sides and then put it on a rack in the bottom of the fridge for at least  hours preferably overnight. Pull it out an hour before cooking and allow it to come to room temperature. I sear it in a  mix of high fat butter and olive oil  minutes each side basting constantly.

10228608,0,t1_dc3fn2l,Heh. One piece of my cast iron collection is a Rnneby pan for tiny pancakes. D Im a Finn BTW.Im perhaps not the best person to talk about this since Ive grown up using cast iron and even though I had a few Teflon pans at one time Ive gotten rid of them ages ago. You could say Im a bit biased.Cast iron is a somewhat different way of cooking from Teflon  to me its the easier and better one being far less precious for instance you can use metal utensils for doing things on cast iron with no problems in addition to the aforementioned thermal capacity but its not as insanely nonstick as Teflon so it might take a bit of getting used to as might the way a heavy pan with a lot of thermal mass behaves if youre used to the much lighter Teflon pans that heat up and cool down quite rapidly. In the end I personally like cast iron a lot and find it convenient and easy but ymmv. If your family likes to cook and have cast iron why dont you ask if you can try theirs first?I dont know how well you treat your Teflon but I certainly couldnt make my pans last for more than maybe  years when I still had Teflon so if youre like me youd be at least saving the money and aggravation of buying a new pan twice a decade.,mildlyinteresting,dc3gxhq,0,t5_2ti4h

Typically burial plots at least here in UK are allocated for  years. What happens after that? Dig up the tree? Also there would be very little space left to bury people. The UK is a fairly small country and there is no land which isnt owned by someone and burial space is limited and very expensive. Lets face it what is the point of a burial site really? I think its better if we are just cremated .. or better yet .. give our bodies to science if they want mine i doubt it.. ive abused it too much,mildlyinteresting,dc69zk2,6,t5_2ti4h

It is used as a flavor enhancer and is a way to make things more salty or savory without adding more salt. It had a big push with older generations because they thought too much salt in a diet led to lots of health problems that have now been proven to not necessarily be true. You can get it at pretty much any grocery store. Some people can have reactions to it but it is rare.

10282817,0,t1_dc9lgfv,Ive actually found that entomologist LOVE reefkeeping so its super funny you should say that. There is an abnormally large amount of them in our local fish club.  Probably because in my opinion its a more socially palatable way to keep invertebrates so I think they prefer saying hey look at my fire shrimp vs insert weird insect here  Funnily enough Im terrified of bugs and insects but my heart nearly bursts from the cuteness when i look at shrimp or crab or even the conch OP posted.  In terms of sea cucumbers pretty much everything i said still applies  check out the bullet point here on venomous   Usually cost is what drives the popularity of inverts in the saltwater reefkeeping world and reefsafeness aka will they engage in chemical warfare or irritate move the corals or eat them. No one wants their  LPS eaten by a  invert.  It happens. I had a  shrimp eat a  fish once. Im still not over it.  Fun fact about l.tesselata is if they find another pom pom crab without poms micro anemones they will either share one if they have two or if they only have one tare the one in half anemones can be propagated this way not ideal but survivable and give the other half to the crab that doesnt have any.  Is that not the cutest thing? She also recognizes at least i like to think so  when i hover over the tank she comes out and immediately starts waving those poms probably thinking Im about to feed the tank every time. I love them so.  I dont blame on you wanting to be pet free for a while. I travel alot mostly for concertfestival going purposes and its definitely difficult to train someone to care for the tank appropriately and to my standard and trust them to make good choices when i go away. Luckily the tank can generally care for itself for atleast  days without me worrying. Lights are on an auto timer I dont feed every day i feed every  days frozen only  time a week tanks been stable for  years now etc. That being said there have been a few times where Ive considered taking it down so that i can travel more.  The only thing that stops me is knowing that considering how established the tank is  most of the inverts wont survive the stress of a tank change.  How could i knowingly kill them after caring for them for  years? Cant do it.   Anyway if you change your mind about the pet situation and have questions feel free to dm me Ive kept many a rare pet including being a toucans mother briefly. haha.,mildlyinteresting,dc9m3uw,2,t5_2ti4h

Theres a lot of stuff you can do with multifinger gestures. Rightclick is a two finger tap like on all laptops nowadays. Two finger swipe scrolls. Two finger pinch zooms. Threefinger swipe updown shows the desktop and restores view respectively. Three finger swipe leftright switches windows. Fourfinger swipe up shows all open windows in thumbnails down restores. Fourfinger swipe leftright switches workspaces. Fourfinger pinch opens application menu.Having never used it before I picked it up in about an hour and then felt a bit crippled on my Linux laptop or when using a mouse on the mac.Theres a lot of things OSX does in odd ways but apples UX engineers are definitely top notch.,mildlyinteresting,dcg20ve,9,t5_2ti4h

10380847,0,t1_dckpkcv,For me it is severe constant pain. The things the books dont generally say is that bodies like equilibrium. When your tendons and ligaments are hyperlax and arent doing their job something else has to pick up the slack. So all of my muscles are constantly super contracted from holding my joints in place themselves. I tell people thats its like this if you jumped up this moment and did a triathlon followed by a full circuit of the gym machines as heavy as possible you know what your body would feel like the next day? Thats about average for me.Then there are the injuries. I dislocate something a few times a week. For me its most frequently vertebrae  about  daysweek I have one out of place which makes doing anything impossible. I also do just about every other joint though  fingers are easy shoulders and knees are rough and hips are the worst. Thankfully right now my hip only rolls up on the joint before snapping back down properly rather than coming all the way out on the wrong side. I learned how to reset my own shoulder at . I use a wheelchair to go to the mall and stuff because Im often injured and even if Im not I can be just by standing up wrong. There are people who have it better than me and some who have it worse. I cant work any more some people can work part time and on the far end some peoples doesnt interfere with work at all. Its a wide spectrum. ,mildlyinteresting,dckqeo4,3,t5_2ti4h

10417589,0,t1_dcogbsz,I recently worked for a spine company and designed my own set of these screws and rods.  If you dont mind me asking you can also PM me  what age are you? Also just to note spinal fusion should always be considered the last course of action taken at all costs.  The chances of bony fusion are .... Which means  of cases are not considered successes.  So while this abnormality of your bodily shape and form may be unpleasing to yourself you really really need to consider how scoliosis effects your quality of life.  Generally in single level lumbar cases where one of your discs is this issue fusion of two vertebra fixes the debilitating pain caused by pinching of the nerves.  This seems all fine and dandy but u fortunately this loss of mobility is translated into more movement of the superior and inferior discs.  More movement of adjacent discs  shorter life span of these discs.  Essentially the fusion will cause your other discs to fail sooner.  This isnt an overnight failure but may happen anywhere from  years from surgery.  There are lots of factors involved in determining whether or not surgery is the best option.  If your scoliosis is stable xrays taken over  month intervals show no increase in the angle of incidence of both the lumbar and thoracic curvatures then surgery most likely isnt something that should be considered  unless of course it is causing serious quality of life issues trouble breathing due to compression of the lung inability to support oneself in an upright position and so on. The no surgical treatment options include injections for the pain a bandaid type fix that has diminishing returns certain external bracing I actually dont know much about external bracing so I will not comment on its effectiveness or even just certain stretching techniques again not an expert on these.  Lastly Im not a medical professional.  I am in no way qualified to be diagnosing or advising you to do anything  Thats what the doctors are for.,mildlyinteresting,dcowh9e,2,t5_2ti4h

I agree. But Obama chose these nations as dangerous places because of mass violence war and chaos erupting within their borders. ISIS and other groups are waging a holy war beheading gays minorities and enforcing barbaric sharia law on the people. This is not a gang they are running the government in some places. So you can make judgements about groups of people and place extra scrutiny again what Obama did on certain countries in time of strife.Every nation on earth has had debates on refugees and the pros and cons of how you should go about helping or not helping them. So this is not some blanket ban on muslims like the false news media is portraying it as and willfully lying about this is a sovereign nation making sure the previous administrations policies were effective.My god.

10623389,0,t1_ddbiwek,I wouldnt even say theyre hacking printers. This happens all the time. This is like sending advertisement faxes to random fax machines or all black pages to waste their toner or making crank phone calls to random landlines out of the phone book or putting junk flyers in the mail and sending a bunch of coupons to peoples homes. Youre using the devicesservices exactly as theyre designed but for a different purpose.The printer is on the internet with services enabled specifically for anonymous printing. Thats what those services running on port  are designed to allow you or anyone to do. So some dude looked them up in the internet phonebook shodan and started printing to them.

Depending on needs sometimes dies the name of the thing that contain the actual black magic are binned selected either for max performance clockspeed low power or both. Other times if some parts have defects part of the chip can be fused off like turning a core CPU into a core CPU. Other times perfectly good features are turned off because marketing see intels hyperthreading as a common example. Perfectly good die with features turned off only so they can charge you more to turn them back on.

10775954,0,t1_ddrfxjw,You can always go take a ferry to Madeline Island in the apostle islands. theres a town there  Bayfield WI and you can rent kayaks in the area Im sure. It may be good to find a guide as Lake Superior weather can change in an instant. I was sailing last year one day and wavesstrong winds absolutely came out of nowhere. It can be quite surprising! Duluth is simply the greatest city on Lake Superior and Ill fight anyone who says otherwise! Theres cheap hotels all around. Canal Park is fun but I prefer Minnesota point no fires allowed or Wisconsin pointfires allowed for relaxing on the beach. The North Shore is a mustsee. Tons of camping spots all along and the Superior Hiking Trail can entertain you for a whole trip. Carleton peak and Oberg mountain area are some of my favorites for camping but you can hike literally anywhere. Im sure theres places you can find for renting to go boatingsailing but idk because i got my own boat heh On Wednesdays sailboats race around the bay in front if Duluth and you can join as crew if you have experience or as ballast if not. Make sure you check out Duluth Trading Company I believe they have a lifetime warranty on most stuff for sure bagsbackpacks. Expensive but trusty! grand Marais is the second best town on Superior but its quite aways up the shore almost to CANADA. Sleeping Bear Dunes is another great spot to camp etc. but the season is a little too structured for my taste but you can get a kayak and have a ferry take you to islands South manitou perhaps and you can explore there. Oh and Isle Royale Take a ferry hike to the other side and return!

This would stop the barcode and text on the side from being seen on the display at any angle.  As someone who merchandises I love it when manufacturers do this for us.  And honestly some times when they do this you can actually end up getting more items on the shelf in the same amount of space depending on the product dimensions.  Stockers do not want backstock and if Oceanspray has two front facings on the shelf but now I could do it sideways and get three in the same space and that gets me two more bottles on the shelf at a time?

10825041,0,t1_ddw7md9,At McDonalds a few months ago I ordered a Big Mac.

Hes like The machine only lets me put x on the order is that cool? Nine times the pickles and onions? Seems a little excessive but whatever. If its that crazy Ill pull some off when I get the sandwich.My order comes up and my thengirlfriend and I sit down at the table. I look at our order. Shit I say they fucked up and accidentally gave me a Double Big Mac. This better still have the extra stuff on it at least. Turns out when you order x the pickles and onions your Big Mac no longer fits in a Big Mac box. No word of exaggeration the layer of pickles on each section was about as thick as a patty and there were so much little onion pieces that trying to eat it without losing some into the box on every bite was a lost cause.I didnt remove any pickles and it was the best Big Mac I ever ate.,mildlyinteresting,ddwiyz8,1,t5_2ti4h

10826582,0,t1_ddw375z,gt Putting the toilet parallel to a wall saves a lot of space and most house designs make bathrooms quite small. So unless youre lucky enough to have a large square footage in your home then youd most likely benefit much more from a standard toilet. It depends on the layout.My last apartment had a really tiny wellplanned bathroom. When you opened the door the bath was on your left the heater and external window were facing you and the sink and toilet were on the right. The sink was by the door and if theyd had the shortsightedness put the toilet in the traditional way you would have nowhere to put your right leg. Mine was not a cornershaped cistern but a normal lowflow oval one and it was perfect for the space.,mildlyinteresting,ddwoou3,1,t5_2ti4h

10929366,0,t1_de76jvk,gt Your post assumes incorrectly that it is never possible to discern that another person may be transgender.Your post assumes incorrectly that its any of your business what genitalia someone uses to urinate with.   gt How do you know this type of act wont become more frequent if rules allowing trans people to use the bathroom of their gender identity are effected?Going into a bathroom is completely different from harassing or assaulting someone in a bathroom.  It is and will still be illegal to assault or harass people in bathrooms regardless of gender or orientation.  Gay men are already allowed in mens bathrooms and gay men harassing or assaulting straight men in bathrooms isnt a widespread problem.  Lesbians harassing or assaulting straight women in bathrooms is similarly rare.  Are you worried that a straight person is going to use Im trans as an excuse to get into a bathroom where they will then harass or assault someone?

11094857,0,t1_depkh9u,Not to try and actively be an ass but No shit. Im not a moron. Also everyone has seen that comment about a million times.That said if you previously had a diet with a nontrivial amount of sugarheavy caloriedense foods in removing those items from your diet you are obviously subtracting the associated calories.If you were previously consuming those things and not actively getting fatter then you must be eating at an average maintenance intake of calories. If you were at maintenance and you subtract a calorie source from your daily consumption you will now be at a deficit. Which means losing weight.So all else equal the only way to remove those things from your diet and not reduce your calorie intake would be to replace them with equally caloriedense food items. If you drink two oz cokes a day and replace that with seltzer your diet has suddenly dropped about  calories. Youd have to replace your soda drinking with eating like  loaf of wonder bread extra every day.ampnbspHence the weird.ampnbspAnyhow this isnt magical thinking. The only problem with sugar besides the fact that it hits the pleasure centers of our brain really hard and therefore rewards us strongly for consumption is that its so stupid calorie dense that its easy to have a crapton every day without realizing it and unnecessarily jack up your calorie intake.ampnbspOh also stop spreading this all calories are equal trope. Raw calorie count is a really great rule of thumb for keeping an eye on general daily consumption but its not even remotely true  ,mildlyinteresting,deplbzs,2,t5_2ti4h

11117130,0,t1_ders2iu,I believe people are down voting because they dont know the difference in meteor impact craters and asteroid impact craters. The biggest asteroid craters in N. America are the Manicoagan crater in Quebec that has an estimated diameter of  miles  the Chicxulub crater on the Yucatan peninsula which has an estimated diameter of  miles  and the Chesapeake Bay crater that had an estimated diameter of  miles. Still it is incorrect to say the Barringer crater is the biggest meteor crater in N. America because it only has an estimated diameter of . miles.  The Pingualuit crater in Quebec was caused by meteors and it has an estimated diameter of  miles and the Ames crater in Oklahoma also caused by meteors has an estimated diameter of  miles.  That being said Barringer is still very cool to see in person.,mildlyinteresting,des48sc,3,t5_2ti4h

Planckton is passionate about sharing art exposing arts importance in society and advocating sustainable living throughout the United States.Planckton her partner Leroy and their two small children live in what they call Dragonflybus a converted  Chevy  School Bus with a  Blue Flame van welded on top for additional space. Planckton says weve got solar panels a refrigerator and a really warm stove our floors are finished our walls are finished my bed reclines down from the ceiling my kids have bunk beds in the back. I am an extremely happy homeowner. The walls are insulated with repurposed denim and the stove is woodfueled vintage and sturdy.And its truly a homeDragonfly bus looks inside like any other home to a family with small children. Trinkets and toys are stashed and strewn and the welcome warmth and color are undeniable. When I visited there was even a blanket fort in progress.Plancktons art is an eclectic collection of portraiture still life and scenes from her travels. And while Planckton is an artist the exterior is crowdsourced art. Whenever the bus hits a town Planckton issues an invitation for residents to add their own art to the bus.The Pajama Factory community enjoyed having Dragonflybus and Plancktons family with us for a week and a half their commitment to living a life of art aligns with our ideals and mission. Were looking forward to another visit when their travels bring them back this way.,mildlyinteresting,dey5j8w,5,t5_2ti4h

11223425,0,t1_df44njg,Very different Sicily speaks a different dialect but the differences go way further back.  IIRC the Greeks colonized at least part of the island before the Romans and even the Carthaginians had a handle on the island before the Romans took over.Fun fact On a completely separate note the Sicilian dialect is closer to proper Latin than standard Italian.  That is why the word vincere is pronounced with the w and k sound winkere whereas the normal Italian dialect pronounces it vincere with the soft c as in chew.Yup you guessed it.  Veni Vidi Vici is supposed to be pronounced Winny Weedy Weeky.,mildlyinteresting,df45tjh,1,t5_2ti4h

So if there is sufficient light intensity level inside the car or train and at the same time not very bright ambient background outside the car you will see both images overlapping onto each other where one is passing through the glass from the outside and another bouncing from inner airglass boundary inside the cartrain.And light is not scattered because it has been reflected from enough smooth surfaces. ,mildlyinteresting,df4aji6,1,t5_2ti4h

They are often drawn in continuous patterns that repeat reinforcing the swastikas relation to rebirth and renewal.Sauvastikas are typically drawn with arms that suggest clockwise movement and the arms are about halflength compared to a swastika.These are associated with misfortune and curses. There was a time when drawing one on someones home was considered a method of placing a curse on that family.

11300437,0,t3_618da3,This makes me nostalgic for my childhood. My mother used to tell my sister and I made up bedtime stories about a little gnomefairytiny person named and Im not joking Hazzabaga. She would tell us about how he built furniture out of little twigs and used leaves and flower petals for his roof and carried flowers as umbrellas and had a pet lizard that he would ride to the secret fairy market that was buried deep under the big tree in our yard. He found a fairy girlfriend and together they learned to tame the tiny birds that hung out in our yard and helped protect their nests during storms. I always loved those stories.My wedding last year was in the woods and just off the path my mother put a little hut made out of sticks and a tiny lawn chair made of wire on a stump. I think Im the only one who noticed but it made me very happy.,mildlyinteresting,dfcvyz9,1,t5_2ti4h

11361036,0,t1_dfjlaht,Hello little man. Boy I sure heard a bunch about you. See I was a good friend of your dads. We were in that Hanoi pit of hell together over five years. Hopefully youll never have to experience this yourself but when two men are in a situation like me and your Dad were for as long as we were you take on certain responsibilities of the other. If it had been me who had not made it Major Coolidge would be talking right now to my son Jim. But the way it turned out is Im talking to you Butch. I got something for you.This bill I got here was first owned by your greatgrandfather during the first World War. It was spent in a little general store in Knoxville Tennessee. Spent at the first place to ever sell wrist watches. Up till then people just carried pocket watches. It was spent by private Doughboy Ernie Coolidge on the day he set sail for Paris. It became your greatgrandfathers bill and he kept it every day he was in that war. When he had done his duty he went home to your greatgrandmother took it out of his pocket put it an old coffee can and in that can it stayed until your granddad Dane Coolidge was called upon by his country to go overseas and fight the Germans once again. This time they called it World War II. Your greatgrandfather gave this bill to your granddad for good luck. Unfortunately Danes luck wasnt as good as his old mans. Dane was a Marine and he was killed along with the other Marines at the battle of Wake Island. Your granddad was facing death he knew it. None of those boys had any illusions about ever leaving that island alive. So three days before the Japanese took the island your granddad asked a gunner on an Air Force transport name of Winocki a man he had never met before in his life to deliver to his infant son who hed never seen in the flesh this old bill. Three days later your granddad was dead. But Winocki kept his word. After the war was over he paid a visit to your grandmother delivering to your infant father his dads lucky dollar. This bill. This bill was in your daddys pocket when he was shot down over Hanoi. He was captured put in a Vietnamese prison camp. He knew if the gooks ever saw the bill itd be confiscated taken away. The way your dad looked at it that bill was your birthright. Hed be damned if any slopes were gonna put their greasy yellow hands on his boys birthright. So he hid it in the one place he knew he could hide something. His ass. Five long years he kept this bill up his ass. Then he died of dysentery he gave me the bill. I hid this uncomfortable hunk of paper up my ass two years. Then after seven years I was sent home to my family. And now little man I give the bill to you.,mildlyinteresting,dfjr3h3,2,t5_2ti4h

We are actually recognizing the disability in places we didnt used to.Also Id like to point out that just because something is natural or isnt doesnt tell us anything about how good it is for you.

Whats double confusing is that electrical switches and breakers are closed when energized as in red. But valves that control the flow of something like water are open when red and green when closed. It all boils down to red means its allowing the flow of something green means its stopping it. ,mildlyinteresting,dfsm4i0,1,t5_2ti4h

Didnt help. And then all growing up hearing my parents say if it still bothers you when you are  then you can get plastic surgery to fix it I looked forward to that day so much. I was crushed when my mom said no! Its your special finger! Its who you are.... Grr. It still really bothers me. I find I keep it curled under a lot to keep it from being seen.

11533310,0,t3_64k8p9,What you may not know here is that is actually a very mature praying mantis.  When manti are born they have a very short growth period reaching full maturity within a matter of months. After feeding and mating and the otherwise dangerous life rituals that they come to master they then move on to philosophy and lastly turn to shaman within the mantis community known only for their immense level of awareness and achieved peace with which they help guide their tribe even contributing to therapy decision making and even sorting out marital issues for newlymated younger manti.As they develop this level of awareness their own body begins to diminish not dying but instead receding to their smallest necessary form and instead displacing their elements into the other creatures and matter around them allowing other life to come from their own life and lightening their overall weight on the structure of the tree or shrub where their tribe resides.  These elders only hold these powers for such a short time before finally diminishing to nothing more than air but relinquishing their powers into the parent structure. ,mildlyinteresting,dg3awxx,13,t5_2ti4h

11581632,0,t1_dg8nwe2,Thats a nice thought but if you compare states that HAVE passed various strong pedophelia laws and those that HAVENT you see that there is no difference among the states that did laws and those that didnt. For example the sex offender registry is completely ineffective and hugely counter productive ruining tons of peoples lives for simply peeing on the side of the road.There are things that ACUALLY work with these sorts of laws but like always the US takes a heavy handed and delusional route to law enforcement and would be the last people to actually implement policies that work.In fact almost every single criminal law the US passes goes against the recommendations of academics the whole system is a disaster resulting in the US having the highest prison population and the least effective legal system in the world. If youre putting more people in jail than anyone else thats a sign that your system is the least effective in the world not the most effective.An effective legal system is where crime prevention is so good that youre shutting down prisons because you dont have enough inmates to fill them. An ineffective system is where youre constantly building more prisons and have more and more inmates every year. Which of these two do you think the US resembles the most?Its a little sad when you point to the US legal system and people in the US dont realize that its obviously the worst system in the developed world.,mildlyinteresting,dg8s9gg,3,t5_2ti4h

11614578,0,t3_65prjf,Hey allSo to expand on what a few of you discussed already the shoot apical meristem analogous to the roots is the root apical meristem is an undifferentiated hemisphere of cells that are demarcated into  layers as a result of the orientation peri or anticlinal of the cellular division The SAM is also divided into zones from the periphery to the center. Chemical signals either environmental hormonal etc. or perhaps a damaged or mutated meristem induces a change in the orientation of division of single cell from anti to perclinal I believe. This signals peripheral cells to also change the orientation of their cellular division. The change in division orientation creates a strict polarity between what becomes the dorsal lower part of a the lead facing the earth and the ventral side upper which is is regulated by a pathway of microRNAs. This is how a simple leaf is formed. For compound leaves as in the case of this plant the steps are similar but more redundant. The entire compound leaf including the rachis stem of a company leaf and leaflets are the result of the same physiological pathway.In the case of this plant something like a mutation of a transcription or cofactor signaled the plant to produce a leaflet rather than a rachis which is the result of cells having the wrong identity.Miraculously the plant recognized that the cells making up that organ were misidentified and reverted their identity back to undifferentiated cells and subsequently were reassigned to become a rachis.Yup plants are pretty amazing.Also someone should add to this if they know a little bit more about signaling pathways in leaf production!,mildlyinteresting,dgcitiq,11,t5_2ti4h

That they simply swap out from apartment to apartment until theyre too broke to work anymore.If you want to change your locks do it yourself. Its really not that hard and they sell all in one kits for both the knob and deadbolt and double packs for those of you with an outer and inner door so its all on the same key. Just make sure your landlordmanager gets a copy in the event of an emergency.... And dont think you shouldnt give them a copy of your key. In most states they have a right to enter your apartment via notice or in case of emergency and if it involves them having to break down the door? They will either charge you for the damage or evict you. So just... Spend the two bucks get a spare made let em have it.,mildlyinteresting,dgupmjp,5,t5_2ti4h

Every decade or so brings a new awsthetic due to the technologies and taste of the time. The car companies are then just hashing out variations of the current aesthetic. That said  the designers arent nececarily  to blame. We want to make cool unique cars every time.
