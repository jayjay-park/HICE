I think at the beginning I genuinely felt that my sex was wrong but now it just feels like my motivation was sort of an escape.  A big part of it was I felt like it was almost a life or death situation.  As in I had to do whatever it took to escape the male sex role and the two options seemed to be transition or suicide.

These communications were then passed on anonymously to the University administration and as uAstraloid post suggests Jezebel.I think I speak for nearly the entire University community when I say that this behavior if true is disgusting and morally reprehensible. It is not representative of AUs culture and community and it will and should remain a black mark on our reputation.Speaking from a personal note I think the Jezebel should be ashamed of themselves for posting nonredacted emails.

860825,0,t1_ch1yc34,gtQuestioning a clients perceptions that they are the wrong gender is considered to be reparative therapy akin to trying to change someones sexual orientation. Thats really puzzling to me. If someone has a dysphoria which is a way of saying hatred about their body surely there must be some other solution other than to validate that hatred. No other mental illness is treated the way that gender dysphoria is treated. A person with gender dysphoria hates or feels really uncomfortable with a part of their body and these so called mental health professionals think the best solution is to validate that hatred by having them mutilate that body part off or to get plastic surgery to change it. Seriously what other mental illness is treated this way? I mean could you imagine a psychologist telling a depressed person yes you are a piece of shit and I want you to go have plastic surgery because youre just not good enough the way you are? Or no ones ever going to love you until you get massive amounts of plastic surgery starting with a nose job? Or telling an OCD person yes you are absolutely right to be washing your hands  times every time you touch a doorknob thats absolutely a rational and healthy thing to do? Or telling an anorexic yes its true that lbs makes you a total fatty and I really think you need to fast more better yet why dont you get some plastic surgery to remove all that fat you heifer because no ones ever going to love you until you can maintain lbs?Thats basically what the treatment for gender dysphoria is doing right? That just really dosent seem right to me. Call me crazy but when I hear of someone who hates part of themselves I dont want them to continue to hate that part of themselves. I want to help them either accept and love themselves for who they are or to encourage them to make healthy changes in their lives. ,GenderCritical,ch24q6i,6,t5_2yk5v

One thing that poor quality studies andor studies with an agenda tend to do is cherrypick results. So if they are trialling a homeopathic remedy for instance and they give questionnaires to the study participants asking about  different aspects of health before and after and then once the results are in there is an average improvement in  items average worsening in  items and no change in  items then a study might only include the  items where there was apparent improvement and maybe  or  of the items where there was no change to make results look more positive than they are.A similar mechanism could be at work even if they arent engaging in such overt dishonesty. Perhaps they just made a little less effort to followup with the female participants as they approached the yearmark subconsciously aware that the risk for adverse events would increase significantly after that point in those who dont get hysterectomies and out of the desire to help them and other FtT people dont want people to think its really risky and might make it more difficult for them to access testosterone.Thats just speculation of course.

1425984,0,t3_2agp7i,Its not about you.There its that simple.Its not about you. The world does not revolve around transgender people. Feminists arent sitting around asking how we can hurt transgender peoples feelings. Feminists dont use pronouns in their blogs in the event that some transgender person might stumble across it two months later and read it.We even use sex correct pronouns in private when there is nary a transgender person around.In feminism there is a quote that boils down feminist activism the personal is political. The phrase was popularized in the early s and persists as something of a mantra among feminists today.The phrase means that our own personal actions have political meaning. We are not outsiders looking down into the patriarchy we are members within it and we operate and exist within it. Language the way we convey ideas to others has always played a significant role in feminism. I used to be a good girl and go by the pronouns I was told to use. When I first got into radical feminism I thought the blogosphere was mean and that we could be sympathetic to transgender peoples distress while still making progress.But I realized just how powerful language was and how politically important it was to acknowledge transgender men that is biological males as men in language. It is difficult to discuss sexism and patriarchy when referring to the oppressors with the same words used to describe the oppressed.  Treating gender as a personal identity obscures what it actually is a system of oppression. And being able to discuss and get to the root of sexism is far more important than appealing to peoples feelingsdemands. My radical feminist utopia is a world free of gender where there are no gender pronouns at all. Curiously or not transgender people and the rest of patriarchy does not want that to happen.We do not live in a genderfree world however. We live in a world where people are differentiated on the basis of their genitals sex and from these sex categories are socially ascribed different roles responsibilities and expectations gender. Manwoman heshe  these have never been terms to describe and validate personal identity. Gender pronouns do not exist because society thought it was so important that everybody feel validated in their personal gender.

During plenty of periods in human history the only way that women could be reliably listened to was if they appealed to supernatural authority. Thats why there were prophetesses by the score in for instance th century Europe. And yes during those periods men would hate and fear womens sorcery even as they were compelled by its apparent supernatural legitimacy. The trope isnt particularly applicable to Reddit culture but it certainly exists. A history of the witch hunts is a history of sexism in many ways.gtgender feminismWe dont see things the way Christina Hoff Sommers sees things.

3559833,0,t1_cpw285i,wow thanks so much for taking time to respond it genuinely means a lot... sorry i didnt reply immediately yesterday was kind of hectic. ummm i am going to reply paragraph by paragraph because i feel like thats the easiest way to keep track of my thoughts hopefully this will not get super longADDENDUM it did blah sorry  it mostly involves my fumbling attempts to convey my experiences and like sort out how i feel about stuff i totally would not blame you for not reading it PgtWell you do know that not all women are short with tiny heads hehe. Its all in a bell curve...I dont give a rats ass about being typical or average.Haha yeah it occurred to me later that emphasizing the whole ribcageandhead size thing and height is a bit off since theres def some overlap between male and female there morphologically... its just something that has always bothered me well since puberty i guess even long before i considered being transsexual as a possibility this like illfittingness or whatever which was super confusing because im not really that big for a guy. but yeah anyway thanks the reminder that this stuff is really variable.gtI really cant tell you how to cope but I can share how I think which may or may not help...Im still that grownup tomboy which I prefer to call a lowmaintenance woman.i identify with this so much like especially the word feminine itself making me squirm lol. obviously i wasnt a tomboy since i was a boy but yeah as a kid i wasnt stereotypically feminine bleh or whatever. honestly i think my childhood wouldve been a bit rougher if id have been female my parents were also really relaxed about gendering stuff but the world at large isnt and i picked up on it enough that when i did think about gender stuff which i dont really think i did all that much when i was a kid like its really hard for me to relate to trans people who talk about memories from the age of  or whatever i was glad i was a boy. puberty made stuff way more confusing but yeah even then i never felt feminine again bleh or whatever and as an adult im not like opposed to feminine stuff than i was as a kid i used to be like eww makeup why but im also not really drawn to it. i guess id describe myself as tomboyish as well if it didnt sound asinine since im you know... still basically a guy.gtI dont have to identify as a woman...being female is no more relevant to me than my ethnic background or nationality.yeah this is what ive always thought and how i still tend to think and this is why this trans thing is so freaking hard to deal with for me because its so contradictory to my core beliefs basically. like ive never hated being a guy theres a lot of things that are fine about being a guy except i really feltfeel super uncomfortable being male in a purely physiological sense... but even thats not entirely true because if im being totally honest i dont like being seen by others as male as well so theres definitely a social component? but at the same time i dont really want to be seen socially as female because of the stew of social expectations and stereotypes and stuff that goes along with that... but it also feels like being seen as female is more accurate? even though i realize rationally its notbut yeah so far as personality goes i also agree on both counts that personality doesnt need to match sex and that what a lot of people are calling gender identity is basically just personality. to be honest ive always thought my personality fits being male better if were going by stereotypes its yet another thing i stress about regarding transitiongtBut I was lucky to have liberal parents...I dont know but it seems a likely factor contributing to trans identities.like i said my parents were pretty awesome about not enforcing gender stuff. as a kid my sister and i played barbies and we played in the dirt and we played action figures and we mixed everything together and the only time my mom intervened was to get annoyed if one of us suggested something was only for boys or only for girls. so yeah... there are few things i feel like i can rule out with certainty but a rigidly gendered upbringing contributing to whateveritisthatswrongwithme is one of them. i mean a lot of trans people do come from that sort of background but i definitely dont.gtI dont discount your turmoil and the feelings of not fitting but again does it really need to match or fit?well thats the frustrating thing i fit in fine as a guy. i mean... ok im not like super masculine by stereotypical standards i guess but thats never been an issue i am who i am and its never been an issue. since coming to terms with being trans or whatever ive been even more me i guess like i dont make any attempt to act dudely or whatever even though i havent yet transitioned and i guess i come across pretty feminine meh for a guy but everyone continues to be super nice to me from strangers to people i know so yeah.gtThe only reason we have two sexes in the first place is to facilitate reproduction whether or not we choose to use that capacity or are born sterile its still the point of it all. But Ive had more than  years to think about this and reason it out so Im not going to say that it will be easy for someone to think this way overnight. After all our gender system is one big societal sacred cow embedded consciously and unconsciously throughout cultures. But I think its worth it. well i def havent been thinking about it that long im in my twenties but gender and stuff has been something ive thought extensively about mostly because of trying to figure out what my issue was. tbh i discovered more gendercritical feminist stuff long before i knew what transgender meant so thats always been the framework ive operated with... and not just because i came across it first but also because i think it works far better to describe the world than most. i mean in my early twenties i came to the conclusion that i didnt have any gender identity whatsoever but since i was male id just be the best guy i could be and it wasnt until my body started really masculinizing in my midtwenties that the trans thing kind of came to a head and i had to confront all this crap.gtIt may not be the easy way in the short run but in the long run it will be. It follows the old truth First do no harm and part of that is to respect bodily integrity and to change a healthy body to fit outmoded stereotypes just goes against all Ive ever been taught. I see the idea of transgenderism as putting a bandaid on a broken leg and making victims out of suffering people by telling them that if the shoe doesnt fit to cut the foot rather than to change the shoe or to go barefoot.tbh im not really worried that im doing this due to stereotypes or whatever or well i mean i am because im worried about everything but i am worried that im basically just insane in a really bizarrely specific way and that medical transition is just a really tragically involved way of coping. or... whatever. i dunno. i guess whats so frustrating is that im sitting here halfway transitioned and i cant figure out how to go forward because what changes i have undergone do make my body feel less alien than before but also i feel on some level like the process is like so extreme and unnatural and just gross... and so transgender activism tells me that wowwww i really need to examine this internalized transphobia i have and get over it and im like ok how and then on the other side gendercrit feminists and honestly a lot of others i mean treat the mind not the body is pretty much the first thing that most people think of because it makes so much intuitive sense tell me i should be going at the source of the dysphoria rather than changing my body and im like ok great but again how?? and its kind of super frustratinganyway yeah WOW sorry this got so long and rambly and i totally do not blame you if you didnt read it but typing all this stuff out helped me organize my thoughts a bit even if they dont totally make sense so thanks for that at least P,GenderCritical,cpy1o5o,1,t5_2yk5v

I dont understand.Then she tells us that we should use the word penis to refer to a transmans vagina or say vagina when referring to a transwomans penis. I just remember being so shocked i couldnt even muster my voice and let out a whispered What?!after a while the students there came to the consensus against her that you can not erase reality just because it hurts your feelings. so as an argument she then goes on to recall a story about one of her acquaintances. a transman who died of cervical cancer because he refused to see a gynecologist because that was a womans doctor. Doctors would refer to the female body parts by their actual names which was triggering of the gender dysphoria to the point that this female refused to have her female body parts looked at and treated.I think i told her something like if that story is true then your friend was crazy. after that point i started to become much more argumentative towards every trans issue which i previously just let go. i started checking peoples sources and reading the papers they claimed were evidence and once that happens i feel like it just snowballs.,GenderCritical,cs7ibtu,22,t5_2yk5v

I hate that it doesnt work well. I hate that it puts me at risk of pregnancy. I hate that they are seen as a scarce resource. I hate that it bleeds and causes me pain. I hate that I cant be trusted with it that doctors ignore my wants regarding it. I hate how I am treated because of it. My PTM was seeing another woman talk about this and seeing her ask for help and talk about her selfcare so she is learning to accept herself and her body and she was called a TERF. People told her she is excluding trans women. She said she was not they just had a different life experience than her no better or worse and they are learning how to accept themselves in a different way. I felt that was reasonable. Apparently I am the only person who thinks so. So I am quiet about my issues with my body.And I want to talk about it. I often wondered in my younger days if I was trans because of how much I hated my genitals breasts and my small weak build. But I am not trans. I am a woman. And I want to talk to people about learning to accept myself as female as a woman. But there is nothing out there for me. No resources for women who have been taught to hate themselves for their biology.Im actually not antitrans. Im not the gatekeeper of womanhood and for the most part trans people havent done anything to me personally. But I am tired of being shut down. And I am tired of being talked over.I just want sisterhood. And I want to learn to be okay with myself.

Because theres only been any IS organization on an international level relatively recently all the language we use to talk about ourselves or the context that we have to work in to explain anything to others was already been defined by the trans community decades ago. Were basically stuck in the shadow of that movement. Coercively assigned or CAFABCAMAB was in fact coined by intersex people to distinguish from the trans version.

6780690,0,t3_48hujh,It comes down to whether one believes  females exist as a unique class relative to males and are uniquely oppressed on that basis not by unknown or uncontrollable forces by men and  this oppressed female class has a right to defineorganizedefend themselves as such from whom? from men.If someone will not agree to the above points then simply they are antifeminist in the most basic sense. If you are a feminist you can not come to a meaningful agreement with someone on the topic of women with someone who is antifeminist. Unless you agree that women is defined solely by femininity andor neurosex. In which case again gt antifeminist in the most basic sense. Anyway the people talking to you are using and twisting the old conservative argument that giving marriage rights to the oppressed gay class somehow takes away rights from the dominant straight class. Obviously all involved disagree with this. But when they make an analogy to MTTs and women what they are doing is inverting the class hierarchy and pretending as if women are a dominant class to men as straight is to gay or at least on equal footing therefore rights cant be taken away from them. And in this way framing the issue as one of transcis erases the existence of patriarchy and malespecific violence because of course trans females in male spaces are not taking away male rights but this distinction is never made as it would acknowledge the taboo reality of sexbased oppression. Thats the first problem they make the same class hierarchy inversion when they relate sex segregation to racial segregation.The second problem is as others have mentioned two gay people getting married affects straight people to literally zero material degree. The same cannot be said for male access to womens prisons homeless shelters etc. eta This is outrageously offensive to gay people that their having a slip of paper that gives them some medicalfinancialetc rights is being compared to a situation that literally puts women at risk of rape. In the same way that it is outrageously offensive to analogously compare black people who are not violent as a class having been segregated to men who as a class are responsible for almost all violence. The people making these comparisons are using and insulting these already oppressed shit on classes and it is absolutely disgusting.And again for anyone who refuses to acknowledge that females as a class are at risk of violence from men as a class and women thus have a right to classbased protections regardless of NAMALT and nice guysMTTs gt antifeminist. For anyone who is willing to tell women who live their entire lives with the barricade of sexual terrorism at the hands of men that they are not allowed to congregate by themselves without men either to emotionally heal or strategize against this endemic terrorism or to maintain physical safety from this terrorism anyone who is willing to tell women that they have no right to fear any male because trust him women he knows his mystical gender identity better than you these are the plainest antifeminist sentiments one can hear. That feminists will immediately disavow their most basic claims and bow down to the same sexism and domination by men when those men wear makeup and wigs when they say it is just an aweinspiring testament to the power of female socialization into a state of submission and selfsacrifice something MTTs clearly dont possess. ,GenderCritical,d0kvj84,8,t5_2yk5v

We need to have a group of gay people who had gender dysphoria as kids to go around schooling therapists on shit they should already know that most of these kids end up happy being gay if left alone and the furthest they should get to transitioning is being told its okay if you decide to do that as an adult and well accept you if you choose to but first lets try to be happy in the body you have without embarking on a lifetime of drugs and major surgery.Instead we have adults pretending theyre the opposite sex on their mere sayso. Medical and surgical transition is not easy or riskfree for any other condition you try the least invasive interventions first  you advise diet and exercise before you do a gastric bypass for instance because going through a major surgery is not desirable and should be avoided if possible. But when it comes to trans stuff suddenly that doesnt apply anymore and we go straight to putting them on the track to major surgery without trying less invasive interventions to avoid that outcome.

The best tool for that are the ideas of GC you lot radfems and lesbians  were the first  and often the only voices shouting out on this. The fight against trans has more than one front my battle Im sure you know  why will be with the transing of kids and young people and how the synergy of trans and pornification  is stealing  our biological sex and selling it back as gender and denying young people the chance to discover their own sexuality and selling them  dimensional parts in a karaoke.My target readership if anyone reads it has to include people who do not think of themselves as feminists. To connect with those people I hope to get over something of my character as a bit of a grumpy old bloke non academic using the language of a working middle age parent. If I just repeat RadFem ideology I will add nothing and lose a lot of potential readers.I will point people to places like this and the places on the sidebar for further information. I am sure some of them will find like I did that radFem is grossly misrepresented in mainstream media and that many of the ideas on here outside of trans have great relevance to their own lives and how they relate to people they live with care about or work with.I look forward to your criticism youve all pushed me to set the bar terrifyingly high Id better bugger off and start writing.  ,GenderCritical,d2cbd0b,3,t5_2yk5v

7583209,0,t3_4j59u8,Beyond their gender dysmorphia issues many transwomen seem to be delusional about how well they pass or their own physical size. Their subs are littered with posts about losing several shoe sizes or several inches in height usually in just months due to taking hormones. Never happened. They also tend to dress in stretchy clothing that is ludicrously too small for them. Um when the hem of your dress ends twelve inches above your knees you have just shoehorned yourself into clothing made for someone with a very different frame. And you look like a delusional fool. They are obsessed with quantifying comparing height shoulder breadth ribcage measurements and a bunch of other data that is meaningless without considering proportion. A certain ribcage measurement looks a lot different on some skinnyfat dude than it does on a woman with hips and breasts. I gag at most of their photos because they always try to make some submissive mouthhangingopen face with eyes tilted up to hide the masculine chin and brow. As an actual woman I would be embarrassed to make such a stupid gapemouthed face or to go around in clothes that are five sizes too small. The thing is when you are already physically feminine you dont need to overemphasize your femininity that way. I spend more time trying to look less feminine in order to cut down on leers and harassment than I do tarting myself up and I am still perceived of as extremely femme. They need to understand that constantly talking about soft female skin and quantifying every measurement makes them sound like creepy fetishists. Which I realize many are but their PR goes against that narrative so maybe they shouldnt undermine themselves. When I was younger before there was any visible trans movement I used to think transwomen would make the perfect women in a patriarchy. No inconvenient menstruation they can be promiscuous without the biological risks of pregnancy they can buy fake boobs which are in a porn culture preferable to real ones. They dont have hips or ass to worry about. Remember these features have only just come tenatively back into fashion no matter what males have always thought of them. Plus they have higher metabolisms and dont suffer from being too soft like real women do. All in all in a culture that expects even biological women to fake femininity transwomen arent at that much of a disadvantage. But sadly for them most still walk talk and act like men. And even if more angular and androgynous women have been culturally favored for a while making it easier for transwomen to think they pass its still evident who is XY and who is XX. And no it is not height or a ribcage measurement like these goofs seem to think but overall proportion. Likewise breast implants cant give a woman an hourglass figure. Bone stucture is fixed and a lot of the other development on a male or female plan is done before real puberty even happens. Girls are laying down thigh and hip fat for example even in childhood. Two months on HRT isnt going to address that. ,GenderCritical,d3469qk,27,t5_2yk5v

7637899,0,t1_d3a2p4h,If you use significance testing and fail to show that two means are different that has a couple possible explanations. They arent different. They are different but you didnt have adequate statistical power to detect the differenceStatistical power is a function of a the threshold you use for determining statistical significance b sample size and c the size of the effect youre measuring. For a simple example suppose you have a group of  men and  women. You want to know if on average men are taller than women. The men are  and  centimeters tall. The women are  and  centimeters tall. A statistical test called a ttest will tell you that even though both men are taller than both women the difference is not statistically significant. You can play with the numbers hereWhere Treatment   one sex and Treatment   the other sex.The conventional threshold for statistical significance is . but you can adjust it there to see what happens if you change to . or .. You can also choose a onetailed hypothesis or twotailed hypothesis test. A onetailed hypothesis test means that you have a guess as to which group is taller for instance that you believe men are taller than women and you ONLY want to test for a difference between the means in that direction mean for men gt mean for women. A twotailed hypothesis test means that you dont have a prediction about which group is taller so you want to test for a difference between the means in both directions men gt women and women gt men.So anyway back to our example with only  women and  men in the group a pthreshold of . and a twotailed hypothesis test the calculator will tell you that you dont have a significant difference between the heights of men and women. Does that mean that men and women arent different or do you have too small of a sample to know if theyre different?Thats why significance tests can tell you when two means ARE different but they are less good for telling you when two means are NOT different.That said you can use a pvalue to provide evidence that two means are the same but that is another post and this comment has gotten long enough already.,GenderCritical,d3adx37,2,t5_2yk5v

Yet he remained a Catholic. His hope was to invent a Pill the Church could live with and to this end he came up with the idea of the day break as looking more natural. Also some women complained they didnt like having no period. I learned this as a young girl and that female athletes dont break. so I stopped breaking. No periods no bother.Also I read same thing a woman went to study the natural menstrual patterns of the ancestors by studying an African tribe where the women go to the menstrual hut for their period so easy to track. She found that the girls reach puberty about  and marry at once and get pregnant. In their lifetimes they have til menopause at  about  periods. Always knocked up or breastfeeding. And organic diet no hormones in the food.Compare Manhattan woman typical college girl. Puberty about  menopause   periods in her fertile lifetime.. Same woman also gets womb and ovarian cancer. Now according to this take the pill without breaking you reduce risk of those cancers  every ten years.Whole point was in trying to get the Church to accept a more natural pill this very caring guy unwittingly condemned more women to avoidable deaths.

Thats one thing that unites us regardless of our background and its huge as it defines existence for many women and girls around the globe. This oppression is based on our biology alone and thats why we can have a category of women and we dont need qualifiers. If youre an adult human female you belong to the category of woman and you have faced sexbased oppression. Trans males do not have this shared experience of sexbased oppression.

7817491,0,t3_4mbn04,Lots of good advice here about legal matters so I wont add to that. If you choose to do the interview I would recommend that you clear up some common misconceptions that people have about trans males. Most people seem to think that all trans males have had SRS that they are all gay meaning attracted to males that they all take hormones and that they all try to pass as female. The average person has no idea that the vast majority of trans males keep their male genitalia and are straight. The average person has never heard a trans male talk about fucking a lesbian with his ladydick or his clitty BARF. The average person has never heard of the cotton ceiling or trans males coercing lesbians into sex. The average person has never considered people like Danielle Muscato complete with male genitalia beard mens clothing and malepattern baldness walking around naked in womens locker rooms in front of little girls. The other thing I would bring up that people never consider is the homophobia angle of trans. In Iran they cure homosexuality by transing people. And here we are curing homosexual kids by transing them. And beyond that people are no longer allowed to have a sexual orientation  you are considered a vagina fetishist if you are attracted to actual women and wont fuck someone with a dick. Trans have erased bisexuality  everyone is now pansexual  and have even erased homosexuality  you are gendersexual. You could also bring up the misogyny angle but that will get the least traction because no one gives a shit about women. Sad but true. ,GenderCritical,d3ur19h,8,t5_2yk5v

Im not sure about you only you can pinpoint why you may feel this way. a small percentage of the population has dysphoria  dysmorphia which means repulsion with some part of your body. honestly? a gender therapist is not going to help. theyre going to encourage you to change physically while not changing anything about your mentality or even diving into cognitive behavioral therapy. the truth is this. you are female. you always will be. nothing can change that. the weight of knowing that SUCKS sometimes. because as females we are treated with contempt hatred and downright violence sometimes. but it can get better... begin by reading on this thread. find a womens club to join. and work on selflove. women are awesome... and the only way to get through this life as a female is to believe that.

7888842,0,t3_4ncemc,Heres my story.I will never trust the psych industry after the experience in my menopausal s when I lost my job couldnt get one that paid similarly  and that led to financial difficulties I was on my own.  I had to struggle to keep the house I had paid on for  yrs maxed out  credit cards using them to make the mtg pmt and pay utilities buy groceries etc and my unemployment was limited to  mos what a mess.  I went into a deep depression when basically what I needed was some sound financial advicehelp I didnt even know I could try to sell the house even though it was in foreclosure until a RE agent came by by then she was sympathetic but said it was too latethe sheriff was almost knocking on the door. I had to use the local county mental health clinic which was basically all male therapists the one I saw regularly was gay and very clinical never got any deeper than how I was doing on the drugswhich was  they were awful.  I never saw a female therapist even though I asked for one.   And BTW I had quit drinking any alcohol at age  and had been in excellent physical health eating healthy and exercising.  Even though I had put on some weight into my s I still only weighed about  lbs at .The therapist prescribed Risperdol Prozac among a couple of other SSRIs and at the end lithium when he decided I was bipolar even though I had no income at that point and couldnt afford to get my levels tested.  So I quit taking everything but the Zoloft quit that after another month after a horrible year of drugs that left me worse than numb.  None of those drugs did anything for me even made me  zombielike no energy no motivation to do anything.  I am and was not bipolar was just suffering from clinical depression from the crush of my financialwork situation I had been blackballed in the legal field my friends werent calling no one likes a depressive negative person I was told and I lost everything I had worked so hard formy home.  The problem is once a diagnosis is made its seldom questioned.  One intake worker called me a sociopath.  All the drugs I was taking made me so helpless and confused I couldnt even make a simple decision yet I was told I needed those drugs to functionyet I couldnt function.  With the help of my sons I moved in with the older one and thats when things changed for the better.  I got a job which would pay for my upkeep and have never touched another pill and functioned fine from the day I ditched them.  Dont need them and my mind is much clearer.  I figured that just the move out of the city getting away from those reminders those therapists the drugs and slowing myself down enough to meet my basic needs was enough to allow me to enjoy life as much as possible.,GenderCritical,d42s1qt,10,t5_2yk5v

Some men may advance beyond being pornsick teenage boys but not enough of them.  Males compartmentalize their emotions and activities far more than females do.  And why would any woman want to be a man?For such a tiny percentage of the population MtT are vastly overrepresented in the prostitution industry as well.  While its true sexual pleasure is compromised because of the methods used on MtTs that would have no effect on faked sexual performance when your own pleasure is not the goal but money is.A lot of how we act as males and females isnt just socialization its just how we are different biologically and its why I am adamant about people never being able to change their sex and why the trans train will eventually break down.Im sorry this statistic is so high but as they say you cant legislate morals nor can you stop anyone from risk taking and bringing on their own demise when theyre hellbent on making no compromises to stop certain deadly behaviors.  Giving out free condoms doesnt necessarily mean people will use them for their intended purpose.There is no way to save everyone from themselves nor should that be anyones goal in lifechanging society so that people value themselves more should be the ultimate goal and not everyone will agree that restrictions on behavior is the answer.  We may have already gone too far in the opposite direction with the kind of individualism the US promotes and which has spread due to US imperialism and war.  Being an individual human being no longer has meaningpushing the envelope around behaviors constantly having to be different wo any substance to get attention thus all the multiple labeling were seeing maintaining a level of selfcenterednessall of those mean more.

I might need to decide if its safe to leave my kid with them. gt I might want to strike up a friendship or working relationship with them and would want to be sensitive to the way that our individual sexes effect the best way to do that.Maybe its because I have a looooot of male friends but I think the formation of my friendships and work relationships evolved largely removed from our sexes. Sometimes I make silly flirty sexual banter with my guy friends and because we are all sexual beings one might presume that the sex of an androgynous appearing person would eventually come to light in which case that silly flirty sexual banter would commence.If youre interacting with your female coworkers differently from your male coworkers because theyre female you might be doing the whole feminism thing wrong. Especially if these are formal business exchangestransactions but even if theyre just watercooler talk. If youre using a persons sex to figure out what topics to talk to them about and try to relate to them thats called stereotyping. gt Is sex blindness any more a realistic aim than colour blindness. Is pretending to not notice sex any better than pretending to not notice race.We dont need racebased pronouns and raciallybased names in order to not be raceblind so why do we need sexbased pronouns and named in order to not be sexblind?If a persons race or sex is salient and it may not be if they are mixed race or androgynous appearing then sure use it as a descriptor. The point is that it should only be a descriptor when necessary. We are not haircolor blind its just a physical descriptor that is irrelevant to job applications and math problems and daily conversation about people. Sex in our current society has a whole lot more social meaning than that and more social meaning than just ability to impregnate or be impregnated.

8091639,0,t3_4px2kk,gtJoan of Arc or MulanSo Im a second degree black belta Catholic and majored in history and I hate when people misrepresent Joan of Arc and Mulan.Joan of Arc felt called by God to fight for France. Whether you believe in this divine intervention or not you cannot deny this is a very different motivation than feeling that she was a man and should go do manly things.  IIRC there wasnt even a draft she volunteered to fight.Mulan in the original poem goes to war because her family must provide someone and her father is too old and her brother is too young. She fools the army and the emperor for  years then comes home and goes back to normally expected activities.  Her army biddies dont find out until they come to visit and find a woman.In the movie Mulan tries very hard to fit her gender role at the beginning.  She tries her best to fit in but has a small identity crisis.  She sneaks off to the war because her father is injured and old.  Trans people should actually hate this movie because when Mulan acts as stereotypically male as she can she make a big mess of everything and alienates her peers.  She only starts to get along with army guys after she relaxes and is more or less herself while still hiding her sex.. The end battle scene in the forbidden city is only successful because her three friends and her eventual love interest accept her as a woman who can also fight.  The sequel isnt as good but it does maintain the Be True to Your Heart mantra while showing Mulan being a traditional bride practicing her fighting skills and acting as an army escort for the emperor.  Her normal and functional state is duality she is female and does many female things but she is also capable of traditionally male things and this does not make her less of a woman.  The scene where she does martial arts with the village girls also suggests that all female are capable of duality and IIRC there is some pressure on Shang her husband to express duality by expressing his emotions better. ,GenderCritical,d4pknzs,4,t5_2yk5v

I believe..I know most of you here dont subscribe to my views...but I believe this is all driven by the reproductive system women have to be creatures of sacrifice because they have to sacrifice their whole selves to have children...just think in the days of old how incredibly dangerous and painful it was and it still isnt safe or painless now. But I also believe we dont need to be slaves to our biology. We need to understand how it affects us and how it affects men and then bring the power of our minds to control and shape it for our own wellbeing. We have to sacrifice for children but not for men unless we actively want to but if we dont grasp how biology is driving us we get caught up in the whole serve the male thing. and of course that is than massively magnified by the social set up and its pressures. But note how the guy didnt want her devotion once it was no use and told her to get her own life. Therefore transwomen can never truly be women because they can never understand this. Even infertile women will still have the biological setup so there goes that argument. Transwomen wont even sacrifice bathrooms for the safety of girl children!I remember a woman in the classic The Cinderella Complex who had lived just like this getting behind a musician I think it was making him her whole life and being the perfect wife making a tiny income stretch hosting wonderful dinners on nothing etc. Result? He left her as soon as he had enough money to hire someone to do the catering.  He was bored because devotion is boring especially to creative men. Remember the fictional First Wives Club? something in the book drew my attention the men had all left perfect wives who had no lives of their own. They didnt just leave for younger women but for ambitious interesting women the kind who would never do devotion and who would leave him if he wanted it. Such women are a challenge.,GenderCritical,d58r4ci,7,t5_2yk5v

I was even told  by straight women who later i come to understand as Liberal Feminists that I could not openly say people with penis is not female. That lesbians were evil and bigoted if we didnt want to be matched with them on dating apps and the only time any of us lesbians spokespeak freely is behind close doors and it always starts with  disclaimers i.e I know Transwomen are women just like any other woman.....but.  One of my friends who is lesbian even went on a date with a trans woman she was matched up with online all so she couldnt be accused of bigotry. For we can no longer express out loud our sexual preferences  lesbians are females who date females. Especially online or we are in for harassment.  Coming from a country where it is so difficult to be gay and no one can be openly gay its shocking to see how lesbians in the west are being inundated with this.

Officially the Catholic Church does NOT teach that wives must have sex on demand and have a baby every year until they explode and die.  Most Catholics just ignore the church and use regular BC.  Catholics who care use Fertility Awareness MethodNatural Family Planning.  Not actually the rhythm method.   Then there is an even smaller handful of people who want to be more Catholic than the Pope and just have however many babies.  If they get too strident the NFPusing Catholics tell them to pipe down.Wont deny that NFP presents serious problems for some people but I have used it successfully for three years.  Well see how that goes.

Especially if youre the only woman in the office that is so humiliating that everyone knows these intimate details of your life without your consent and is avoiding you for no reason other than they presume your PMS will make you too difficult to deal with. That strikes me also as a possible HIPAA violation but thats US law so Im not sure that applies in this case since Idk about australia. There is no male equivalent to this behavior  what if the women in the office decided to avoid their male colleagues for a few days every month based on unfounded presumptions of their personal lives and biology? Thats not a healthy working environment for anyone but especially for those being avoided. And you know theyre all talking about you behind your back  if theyre saying this then what else are they saying you know  it would make me paranoid and not able to trust any of my colleagues and that sounds like a terrible environment.

8983756,0,t3_53b6fm,I do not agree that men cannot be feminists. Although where one sits has a profound influence on where one stands ontology shapes epistemology and all that I am not an ontological determinist. I believe in the possibilities of politics by which I mean the power of dialogue argument expression conversation and coming together as human beings etc. to change the social world in ways that improve things for women and for all. That men cannot be feminists seems to be an article of faith a creed of sorts among some. I see feminism as a political stance and program not as something derivative of biology. Even if we give primacy to the material reality of the female body we of course recognize that oppression is not biological but cultural social political. Oppression is meaningful and meanings are at least we hope historically contingent and potentially malleable. To change them we must employ our human not just female capacities for argument empathy dialog speech and imagination including our capacity to transcend our limited personal perspectives through dialog with others. Men many of them possess these capacities.I also think that men themselves are harmed by patriarchythe subjection of women. Much as Marx argued the capitalist is alienated from his speciesbeing from his humanity and other human beings and nature even as he controls the products and means of production men are estranged from their humanity and from others under a system that both stunts and benefits them.Also just being female anatomically does not make one a feminist.

Allah was showing they were bad women by letting them be naked.The drivers at the base...and at all bases really come from poor remote villages. They go straight to the mosque and join the community. they learn hardly any English and they despise all of us but especially the women. They pick up girls after the clubs and think their drunk flirting means have sex with me. There have been spates of rapes by these guys...they dont get what they have done wrong.But nothing can be done.

9101339,0,t3_54w7lb,I am in my late s and most of my peers fall into the following  categories. antifeminists these are women who think equality has been achieved and think feminism has gone too far into punishing men. Thankfully I find this group more rare in the circles I run in. pop feminists these women call themselves feminists but dont do too much about it or think too deeply on it. They will vote prochoice and read a feminist article or two but they arent SJW by any means. They usually nod a long to liberal feminists for the most part because they havent ventured too far down that rabbit hole.  liberal feminists  these feminists are politically and socially active. They post a lot of fb posts on more nuanced liberal feminist issues. I view them as a lost cause they already drank the koolaid. In reality I think many will eventually see the misogyny in their movement but it takes a long time and I dont have the patience to deal with it. The most success I have had is bringing group  to peak trans. I harmlessly inquire whether they think males competing in womens sports is fair or if a non transitioning transwoman should be allowed into a womens locker room...Their common sense usually does the rest. I think liberal feminism seems bigger than it is because so many mild feminists are willing to nod along. It doesnt mean everybody buys their agenda ,GenderCritical,d85u2no,30,t5_2yk5v

Whether the male entering the locker room is a real MTF or just a male pretending to be trans the risk is the same. Childhood socialization has a HUGE impact on how we think and behave and experience the world as adults and there are real differences between the way we raise our girl children versus our boy children. Transition doesnt erase childhood socialization. If it did we wouldnt see so many MTFs being so demanding about having their wants met at the expense of others.

Parents can easily set up children for a plethora of issues as they grow up whether theyre considered authoritarian parents or liberally open minded.  Much of how we handle ourselves as adults is a result of upbringing and how we handle ourselves and our own problems this is why I dont think children should be subjected to trans at all.  Children are seekersbut they should be seekers of truth not whats trendy at the moment and parents who do this are monsters IMHO.There is a reason children of people in certain occupations take on those same occupations and its not because of some inherited trait.  Its because of exposure to it and encouragement by parents to those occupations. Every brain is wired differently even those of your kids.The DNA of twins doesnt ensure that for instance one twin will get a disease like diabetes and the other will or even autism or schizophrenia.

Men will feel the pressure to be even more masculine and women will feel the pressure to be even more feminine and they will all give in.When if this shit blows up it will be brutal. Not an ironic what were we thinking? like we have now for the kind of attires that were considered awesome in the s it will be something dramatic because this is dangerous to the point that we will be worried about repeating the mistakes that led to it being too permissive about the overlap of gender roles and will force ourselves and children into very defined boxes. Kids will be raised to like cars or dolls teenagers will be so scared to deviate from the norm that they will lie to themselves and people around much like gay men and lesbians do with their sexuality and adults will be so insecure of their own selves that they will pick up traditional attitudes and fashion.

This discussion has prompted me to look at the current value of the first flat I bought and make a comparison with current salaries for the job I had at that time.The flat I bought in  for  is now worth about  so thats a  increase in value.  I was only able to buy it then because my grandfather had died and had left me money so I was able to put down a sizeable deposit and take out a mortgage for .  I was  years old then working fulltime as an Admin Officer in local government and as I recall earning around .  Ive checked current adverts for similar jobs now   years later  and unlike house prices salaries have not increased by .  The job I was doing then now pays between  and  per year.  So even if mortgages were as generous and as easy to get now  as they were in  which they most emphatically are not I would not now be able to buy that flat.

I feel instead like I have to censor myself because if I dare say anything positive about a man in my life or an experience with a man then I get downvoted attacked or called a man myself. Im not sure if its a majority here but theres a significant number of GC subscribers who seem to be incapable of believing a woman would have something kind to say about a man so they then just abuse them call them liars or call them men. Its every bit as ridiculous hurtful and immature as hating on all men due to the actions of a minority of men. I put some truth in my username for this purpose. Im a married Christian woman married for  years now and my husband is truly an amazing man and a genuinely good person. Hes been a terrific father to our daughter a supportive and loving husband to me and not one of you here could ever convince or coerce me into saying a bad thing about him. He is living proof of NOT ALL MEN. I understand theres a strong radical feminist component to this sub. Its clear in the sidebar. Thats not what brought me here or what keeps me here. Im here because of the trans insanity because my daughter is in elementary school and already dealing with these absurd gender and identity issues. I dont even consider myself a feminist because I see what feminism is now and I dont want to represent it. I also dont want to represent hatred of men because I know that its only a small percentage of men who are truly a problem just a like only a small percentage of women are truly a problem. Theres an air about this place that stinks with the idea that women are righteous and can do no wrong and that somehow any bad done by men is worse than that done by women. God made both of our sexes and He made us for specific roles. Theres a reason why we as women tend to generally act and think differently than men. This is Gods intention. We complement each other and should not hate each other. Men overall get dragged through the mud here almost constantly and its just not right or productive.

I guess not.Also I agree with your later comment about people having a problem with the lesbiancentric aspect at times. Sadly I have come across this in many radical feminist spaces. Its like straight women arent used to being around so many lesbians in one space and they react strangely to it and reveal some biasesbad attitudes no matter how subtle or subconscious. This sort of thing tends to be far worse in liberal feminism with their Im a feminist but not one of those ugly manhating lesbians! mantra but I still dont really appreciate it here and it makes me feel quite alienated when apparently the existence of multiple lesbians is so uncomfortable or threatening somehow.,GenderCritical,d963fpv,11,t5_2yk5v

Black women did vote in accordance to their interests but not because they necessarily pursued their femalespecific interests but because they pursued their racial interests. Thats my point women in total dont pursue their femalespecific interests which is demonstrated well by the  figure and I dont think the explanation for that is racespecific at all. Women dont identify their sex as something relevant to their lives because theyre so intertwined with men around themselves they cant tell where they end and she begins.

I believe in some cases its a haven for teens who are having trouble defining themselves in other emotional ways. Its taken on a life of its own as a way to stand apart. Many youngsters are using these labels and preferences to garner a sense of inclusiveness or in Js case to use it as a shield.I have ABSOLUTELY noticed this with Tumblr and other sites where if youre straight youre an oppressor so everyone identifies as lesbiangaybisexualpansexualomnisexualpancakesexual regardless of actual preferences. Theres currently a trend in the lesbian community of Tumblr where many people refer to themselves as nonbinary lesbians where they have disregarded gender norms and wish to experiment with gender presentation while remaining with partners that identify as women  though many of these partners are MtT.This has happened QUICKLY. I have multiple degrees and have always been involved with LGBT groups at my colleges due to being bisexual now lesbian before it was cool. In those groups prior to the past year or two it was always mostly gay men a few lesbians and one or two MtTs who seemed pretty chill. There were often drag events where drag queens and kings were welcomed and we had everyone from professional drag performers to men who had never worn lipstick to women wearing illfitting suits theyd borrowed. It was a fun time gender expression was something to be played with and it was a safe space to do it in and everyone minus the beforeitwasatrendtrans people took off their costumes at the end of the events and resumed their normal lives. From what Ive seen in the past year or two though admittedly I dropped out of the group at my last college because I felt unwelcome its mostly MtT some gay men some FtT and a few bisexual women who without fail are involved with burlesque sex work or BDSM. Drag is a dirty word because HOW DARE people take off their gender expressions at the end of the night?

This is something they gets ingrained in their brain since birth men and women are different. Men are humans women are something else. You cant take how a man feels about his human dignity for example and extrapolate a woman might feel like that too it just doesnt work that way.I mean to a lot of them PIV itself is perceived like aggression act of sexual superiority that is designed to please one party by using and humiliating the other they cannot even begin to wonder why on Earth would women agree to it anyway.

We are our biology and the difference between male and female are significant and a huge part of why transactivists are delusional. But the positive ones Being able to give birth breastfeeding children sexual experiences unique to female anatomy. Quite a few women would describe all of the above as positive. For many women periods are a mostly neutral experience and Ive come to appreciate the monthly cycle bit for the way it causes me to pay close attention to my emotionsnot because theyre entirely negative just to have comparisons. Under patriarchy I tend to believe that there is positive benefit to the greater empathy and compassion toward others that women are necessarily socialized to have that it makes us more thoughtful and introspective in general.All that said the problem with calling transwomens experience with harassment for gender nonconformity part of a new womanhood for them is that it normalizes inferior treatment for women. The nature of woman is not one who is harassed or paid less for the same work or experiences sexual violence... yes we often share these experiences with each other and sometimes with transpersons but thats the problem.

10402119,0,t1_dcmup00,Thank you uvulvapeople for the link. gtthat post s they have the same crime rates as womenI am not aware where this claim would come from. The numbers I mention are indeed from the entire cohort from . Separate violent crime data for the two time periods is not provided as it is for other factors like causes of mortality accidents any crime etc so I dont know what numbers the claim that post transitioners have same crime rates as women would be based on. However I do need to correct my numbers  what I stated previously was for FtT and MtT lumped in together. Under supplemental information at the bottom of the article there is a table with ratios separated by sex. By this parameter still presuming the entire year span as nothing indicates otherwise the controlled violent crime ratio for MtT to general male population ratio is .. Considering the difference in violent crime rate between general malefemale populations is about fold IIRC this would still put MtTs at about fold higher violent crime rate than women. The any crime rates though this table does not distinguish by sex do show a decrease from . to . relative to age and sexmatched controls between the two time periods. So it is certainly possible that the . MtT violent crime rate ratio for the entire year span is averaged between a higher earlier rate and a lower later rate but its quite hard to imagine that the  rate could have been so high so as to manage an average of . when combined with a supposed  rate equal to women .. The pre group would have had to been serial killers to make up the difference!Also just my opinion but I would think itd be incongruous for the post controlled any crime rate to be nearly identical to men but then for the post violent crime rate to supposedly be nearly twentyfold lower than other men. But that number is not provided as far as I can tell the next time someone makes that claim you should ask them to point out where they get the numbers.,GenderCritical,dcn5aw7,14,t5_2yk5v

10411818,0,t1_dco56s1,Yes language shapes perceptions.  Ill add to this and say we should not uncritically use words and jargon as transactivists do and that the mainstream media has begun to adopt.   To use trans jargon and their definitions of some words is to confer unwarranted legitimacy on this agenda and view of the world.    Some tipsDont use gender as if it was interchangeable with sex.  Sex is biological  it refers to male and female man and woman.  Gender means the stereotypes commonly known as masculinity and femininity.   I have a sex. not a gender as Im a female a woman not a feminine.  On paper forms if it asks for my gender I cross it out and write sex.Transactivists talk about gender confirmation surgery an Orwellian term if I ever heard it.  Other terms heard are sexchange surgery sex reassignment surgery gender reassignment surgery.  All are misnomers.  Ones sex cannot be change nor was ones sex ever assigned at birth.  I like to call such surgery cosmetic body modifications because thats what it is.TA also refer to ones sex being assigned at birth.  No.  Our sex isnt assigned as if it were something random or arbitrary or something the doctor flipped a coin about.  Rather ones sex is classified by the observation of clear biological criteria.Gender noncomforming  this term implies that the stereotypes of gender are something legitimiate that one is rebelling against.  I prefer to say Nonstereotypical instead as my personality behavior personal style and interests do not refer to the stereotypes of gender either masculine or feminine in any way.  Rather they are a variety of human traits.Misgendering.  Another misnomer as it means the belief that another person is addressing one with labels of the wrong sex not calling a feminine person masculine.  Rather they mean Missexing and it happens to nontrans people as well.Cis  avoid. avoid avoid.  We are women and men not cis women and men.  If necessary to distinguish from trans people saying nontrans is OK.Essentially be very sparing with the use of the word gender and when the context compels you to use the TA terms put quotation marks around them to show you dont find the concepts legtiimate ones.,GenderCritical,dco8wqz,35,t5_2yk5v

Some wonder if they went to far or maybe I am a terrible human being and I just want to cause people pain which is most often not the case.

I think theres a lot of reasons why this is a white thing. gtAre there just as many transgender POC or more and they are just never discussed? Or are there more white transgender people?There are more white transgender peopleif largely because there are more white people in countries where its popular but especially there are more privileged white transgender people. From news reportsanecdotes Ive seen most of the nonwhite transgender people tend to be less wealthy less visible and less aggressive. Theyre far more likely to be involved in prostitution andor involved in drugs andor homeless so not the goto nice folk the media likes to talk about.gtsome correlation with transgenderism and Western individualistic culture and white middle class families.There was an observation on gendertrender not long ago from transdoctorcrazylady Olson Kennedy that all but three of her patients were white and of middleclass backgrounds. The only three black children had been adopted by white families. So... yeah. Its definitely a white thingmuch to Kennedys sadness that she cant sterilize a more diverse group of kids.IMO part of it is a twisted form of white guilt and the hyperawareness of social justice issues that middle class white people often feel they need to be engaged in. Partly its the constant shaming about white feminism and white privilegeoften from other white people. Partly its that they have the time money and are bored enough to sit around thinking about gender ideology andor their kids gender. And partly a few of the actual transgendertranstrender people are simply privileged white men who were tired of being reminded of that fact. Stick it to the feminists AND get a huge crowd of loyal suckups? I dont even think its necessarily deliberate but they want to believe that they are this person that everyone adores rather than some boring white guy.gtBut it can also just be that in transgenderism with POC just never gets talked about.Not that this isnt also true.,GenderCritical,dcxbwl4,25,t5_2yk5v

They are still extremely rare when you take out the transvestites from the equation. At the time they were two completely separate categories.  Autogynephilia is a recent term that is basically what used to be called transvestism.  I was around then  when Raymond published her dissertation as a book so I know what I am talking about.  It was big news when somebody actually went through the butchery it was that rare.  Jan Morris and Renee Richards received huge publicity when they underwent surgical butchery in the s.  It was a huge issue for feminists about Richards because he wanted to compete in womens tennis events and that posed an ethical quandary.  Women were just starting to make inroads in sports thanks in large part to Title IX which became law in  so the ethical problems posed by Richards were even more apparent.  Feminists focused entirely on the ethical problems with this sex reassignment surgery as it was called then and how this was totally incompatible with feminist ideals.  My opposition to transgenderism or transsexualism as it was called then came about around  just as sex changes were being discussed in the media.Transgenderism is a term used only in the past  or  years and it also encompasses transvestites which make up the vast majority of them.

It seems to me that different people naturally seem to have different ascetic tastes and as wavfem pointed out different cultures have historically had wildly different standards as to what was considered beautiful. I guess one could say that based on the standard that some women are more beautiful than others but I totally agree with you that this is no reason to discriminate against anyone.

10807301,0,t3_5dwaqy,Another longtime lurker finally coming out of the shadows ...sort of! I have always had a radical feminist consciousness even as a child long before I could name it. So gender identity ideology never made sense to me  I instinctively found it offensive and regressive. I was a late bloomer physically and once I started University I started getting attention from guys for the first time and that did a number on me psychologically. I was reading a lot of womens mags partying often spending a lot of time on my appearance. I did really poorly in school for the first couple of years but I didnt even care all I seemed to care about was going out and seeing how many guys would hit on me. In the back of my mind I knew this was wrong but being validated by random males something I had never worried about before was suddenly totally intoxicating. I came to hate my natural face and to think I didnt look finished unless it was painted. I learned that sex was about how I looked and sounded not how I felt. I wore ridiculous clothes in the dead of winter and felt awful shivering and almost breaking my neck in high heels but I was sexy so it was worth disassociating from my body and my feelings. At the same time I had still had a feminist consciousness  maleworship sickened me and I knew the ways I was grooming myself physically and psychologically were damaging and unnatural.  I still perform more stereotypical femininity than Im comfortable with but gradually I was able to unlearn a lot of that stuff. So the whole idea of gender dysphoria seemed instinctively stupid to me  who IS comfortable with the contortions we put ourselves through to comply with our gender roles? But I was mainly angered at MtT and the confidence with which they think they have the right to define us  women the global underclass  and to define us by the very things that have hurt us at that. If men want to remove all their body hair wear uncomfortable clothes waste time on makeup take on a passive stance and be hypersexualized they can have at it. But they dont have the right to link those things with women in some kind of inherent way. Ive had many personal peak trans moments though. Some that stand out  Going to a prochoice rally and not being able to use the word women on signage or in chants. You had to use people with uteruses.  Watching the transformation of a local MtT from swishy gay male to a perfect caricature of a blonde bimbo complete with giant implants pornstar makeup and a love of all things pink and sooo cute. He is now dating a gigantic neoNazi with white power tattoos all over his body and all of his social media posts are about their sexy romantic life together  Being in a bathroom alone when a man came into the stall next to me. I didnt see his face but based on the size and shape of his feet Im absolutely certain it was a man. I have never been sexually assaulted but seeing those giant feet I had this instant reaction of fear which I didnt expect even with my gender critical views. I can only imagine how women who have been assaulted feel when encountering strange men in spaces they expect to be femaleonly.  One of my friends works at a homeless shelter. She bends over backwards to accommodate MtT residents even though every single one of them has caused some kind of problem and has eventually been kicked out. She vents about them to me but shuts down if I ask her what the difference is between men who say theyre women and any other men and why vulnerable women should be forced to share a bedroom with a strange man. I understand she doesnt make the policy but she keeps saying that MtT would be at risk in the mens shelter. If thats the case shouldnt the mens shelter be managing the risk? Its just so much a reminder of how women are expected to take anything no matter the consequences for us.,GenderCritical,ddup3wi,35,t5_2yk5v

10866830,0,t3_5v9kut,One problem is how we define jobs. Titles dont always tell the full truth about someones responsibilities. Its quite common to find women with entrylevel titles or lower pay grades doing the same level of work as someone with a better title and higher pay grade. This especially became true when technology wiped out a lot of traditional secretarial receptionist and administrative jobs women in those jobs were often trained to do other work for the company while kept at their lower salary rates. I worked at one company where all of the admins all women went into jobs handling asset management project management etc and it took them a LONG time to realize they were making at least K less than the professionals doing the same work. Companies are great at devising slightly different titles and categories that really do the same or more work as a higherpaying one.Tricky shit like that does a great job of kicking sand over the wage gap. See also salary negotiation. Women have to really advocate for a good salary or raise and run the risk of being seen as pushy and entitled while men will get their demands without much argument  then women are blamed for settling for less. I had a CEO client who promoted herself as a big feminist who was notorious for this.It may be  but many people still assume men offer higher authority performance and intelligence. Women are often seen as helpers in the workplace  a smart loyal dedicated helper while the man contributes vision and leadership and other intangible qualities. And hes the breadwinner  women dont need all that money! So they devise all kinds of ways to ensure men get the best compensation. Unfortunately many women think that if they just exhaust themselves at work they can overcome this. They cant.,GenderCritical,de0u4bl,7,t5_2yk5v

Note that Dolezal sued a university for discriminating against her for being white and that she schooled her younger adopted brother  who is black  to hate white people. So for her this isnt about helping black people or just being part of the community it is an attempt to take on a false image of what she thinks blackness should be.

These are all assumptions and elitist assumptions at that even if all of it were true.Most of my detractors were Im afraid young and inexperienced with womens issues or postBoomer age leftists of a different flavor or male so they didnt really know history well because it excluded women or simply dismissed the concerns of women as we fought for ourselves  yrs ago and laid the foundation for where many women are today in education and work.We can never assume anything about anyone.

11096554,0,t1_depqx23,Im not arguing against all abortions. I explained it further down. I believe the fetus is a life and thats why its not about a womens right to me. Its about human rights for the child. I have exceptions to this rape incest the mother would die having the child the child would have medical issues ect. However a women who chooses to have sex can have a healthy birth to me then comes down to the fetus is a life so its a human rights issue and not a womens right issue. gtWhy do you consider yourself feminist? A prolife feminist is like a pro capitalism communist.I honestly dont believe that. I can still want womens rights and have disagreements on what is and what isnt a womens right. Abortion to me on having a prolife stance isnt about taking a womens right away but protecting the human rights of the child. Sure there is some prolifers who really do only care about taking womens rights away which I explained further down but that isnt my stance at all. My stance is just the human rights for the child. gtDont want an abortion dont get one problem fucking solved. Okay but to me the argument you just said is like dont believe in murder dont murder. Im not trying to change your opinion on this or something I just dont share the same opinion with you on this at all. I dont believe it has anything to do with womens rights just human rights for the child except for the clear exceptions Ive pointed out. gtNo one has a right to use my body against my will. I get what you are saying but my argument is that a women who makes the choices freely that leads to her getting pregnant and can have a healthy pregnancy shouldnt be imo allowed to murder a child and take the human rights away from the child. Which again is just how I feel and my opinion. gtHow can you say you dont hate women if you believe women should have less rights than males?Im not saying women should have less rights than males. I never said that at all. I know you probably wont understand my opinion on this side and sorry for that. This isnt really why I posted here in the first place wasnt my intention to really get in an argument over this just was annoyed at how I was being treated for my opinions on men who are trans getting more care on their feelings over actual girls and women and how as a women I feel like if I have certain opinions I get shunned from certain feminist groups which I think isnt fair at all. ,GenderCritical,deps9e4,1,t5_2yk5v

I got a lot of my info about political lesbianism from people like Sheila Jeffreys who is pretty antiqueer politics but okThis is the annoying thing about forums like reddit youre just shutting down any conflicting views. Its not conducive to discussion or debate and just encourages people to toe the party line and its very frustrating. Not sure why you made this post if you werent going to accept disagreement No actually a LOT of wouldbe lesbians are not identifying as lesbians because of things like this as well as general compulsory heterosexuality. Young women who would have called themselves lesbians in the past? Overwhelmingly identifying out of it as nonbinary or genderqueer or pansexual usually as Im into women and AFAB trans people or queer. But of course anyone who complains about this must just be lying. Youre so worried about bisexuals and straight women identifying as lesbians when the reality is that men are more likely to ID as gay while women are more likely to ID as straight or bi. I dont think that discrepancy is natural sorry cant fool me!But ok lets be hostile and relentlessly scrutinize anyone who calls herself a lesbian even if shes not pursuing men at all Im sure that will help stop lesbian erasure. Nah. I think making lesbians believe they are not actually lesbians leads to exploitationabuse of lesbians far more than political lesbians do so Im far more worried about that lesbians wrongly identifying as bistraight than potentially straightbi women appropriating lesbianism when theyre not actually pursuing menAnyway this just feels a little too much like the time I got called a terf while transidentified so Im out.

And I should smile a lot.  Like she kept smiling and she loved everything I had to say!It was polite to accept any food or drink offered to me even if I didnt want it and within reason one should pretend to like it.  She liked when I bought her a drink!Even the courtesy around declining invitations works right into this paradigm...I remember literally being told that the best way to say No is to say Maybe.I feel like theres something here about how women are socialized to be receptive and agreeable to men in general and how this makes normal polite female behavior often indistinguishable from flirting but I cant quite sort out my train of thought.,GenderCritical,df7n82g,35,t5_2yk5v

11339895,0,t3_61nyua,Disclaimer I am a gay male who works in marketing for gay porn sites. So Im not  certain what happens on the straight side although its most likely the exact same thing if not worse.ALL porn is made for men. All of it. Straight porn gay porn lesbian porn fetish niches.... all for the male gaze and male consumption. Im not a woman but from what I understand women want more erotica and emotional stimulation. Men are visual and just want to see sex.Theres also a weird thing now where men feel entitled to porn. They truly believe its their right to watch porn. Some men mostly millennials get mad when you try and market porn to them and they think they have a right to fap away to all the porn they want without being bothered. They grew up in the free porn era and they think people produce porn as a charity or something. They dont seem to realize it costs money to produce porn. It doesnt just come from thin air.And unfortunately the porn star is the one making the least amount of money. The average pay is like  per scene now... if even that. Some pay . A few hundred dollars to be immortalized on the web having sex. The porn companies own the videos and pictures and use it for advertisements and itll be on their website basically forever. A model doesnt have the power to have it removed. They can request it but usually the site wont oblige. So if a few years later they have a career pop off outside of porn their videos will still be out there. Not to mention all the illegal copies that would still be saved on hard drives and uploaded on random tube sites.Gay porn stars have to supplement their incomes by escorting on the side. They only do porn to create a name for themselves so they can charge more for escorting. Almost every porn star escorts. Even if they do a few scenes a month it wouldnt be enough to pay their bills. And they might do a bunch of scenes one month but then have no work a month or two after. Some sites sign exclusive models and theyll state in the contract that theyll have X amount of scenes per month but thats rare.Which brings the question why anyone would even do porn in the first place? The its liberating and sex positive! thing is a lie. Even webcam models who do shows on their own time in their bedrooms have to deal with a lot of shit. They might have to do a  hour show just to reach their tokenmoney goal. Each token is only worth  cents to a model on most sites so if people are tipping  tokens at a time itll take a while. Theres only so many whales big spenders that will drop  tokens at a time. And then timing and luck come into play with that as well and the model has to keep up an image and connect with fans and build relationships to keep the big spenders coming back to their shows.... which then leads to weird stalkerish relationships where some poor lonely old man is tipping thousands a month to their friend the cam model. Obviously the tipper is eventually hoping for something more out of the relationship. Maybe its just whiteknighting. But some wealthy man or just a man desperate enough to get into credit card debt tipping a cam model will always have a power advantage and have some control over the model. If the model doesnt send nudes when they demand or do private Skype shows you can see how it can turn ugly. And Im sorry but exhibitionists are rare. Most people are camming because they need money. The exhibitionists dont try and make a career out of camming. Theyll turn on their cam and be happy with their  viewers. And surprise  most exhibitionists are men. Theres also some cases where attractive young men do a oneoff cam show but then its recorded and posted online and lives forever and gets more attention then their cam show ever did. And I think in most cases the clingy stalkerish behavior is what scares them off from doing more shows. People get doxxed easily these days and their private instagram accounts and facebook pages get dug up. Men will message the cam model and start harassing them for nudes or offer to pay for sex or just straight up blackmail them send me explicit videos before I send your entire family your nudes!And yes most gay porn stars are straight. Gay porn pays men more than straight porn. The woman is the star in straight porn. So if a man is desperate for cash and thinks porn is the only option gay porn it is. A lot of gay porn stars have criminal records. Like a disproportional number to the general public. Or theyre drug addicts. Not all of course but a huge disproportional percentage are. Theres also a high amount of suicides. Young gay men who seem perfectly happy doing porn end up killing themselves. Theres a report of another suicide almost every month. I find its straight men who are the criminals and desperate for money and the actual gay men are the ones killing themselves. So if porn is so liberating why would gay men be killing themselves for having sex on camera?And then theres the degeneracy. Porn is getting out of control. The trend for a while in both gay and straight porn was the stepsibling and stepparent fantasy. The only reason it wasnt full on fatherson etc was because the billing processors wouldnt allow it. Throwing step in front of the incestual relationship was a legal thing. The models obviously werent related but just the fantasy being played out was enough apparently.And this isnt really the topic at hand but a lot of people get all SJW about people of color in porn. Theres not enough POC and they want to see more. Well the people actually paying for porn dont want to see it. Ive heard that some members will actually complain if an update is wasted on a Black model. Unless its some niche fetish site white muscle men and especially young twinks is what sells. When a Black man is actually used in porn straight or gay it usually ends up some sick fetish. It mostly ends up as thugs with their BBC abusing and dominating basically raping the helpless white person. And then the white person is seen as used and tarnished. Theres almost no market for Black men with Black menwomen. Ive actually heard that Black women dont sell porn. So theyre rarely used.Porn is the LAST place to virtue signal and complain about social justice topics.Anyway it takes a certain person to do porn and usually its a desperate person in a shitty life situation who cant refuse the money. And then theyre exploited the entire way. I realized that and thats why Ive been looking into the antiporn rhetoric recently. Men of course dont seem to care. Its women advocating for the women in porn who seem to be the only ones who get it. Men dont care how porn is made they just DEMAND that it be accessible to them when they want to get off.,GenderCritical,dfhcvjv,9,t5_2yk5v

It was just pure hatred of lesbians to say here is one lesbian character shes the only lesbian in the story and what happens to her? Oh well shes going to be raped by men until shes no longer able to be raped and then theyre going to murder her! but shes okay with it because she gets to have sex with other lesbians who are being raped because lesbians are All About Sex. It was.. disgusting wholly disgusting.eta Not to mention the other lesbophobic language in the book that was really disgusting.

I understand why they become defensive but that is why I dont support uncritically propping them up as flawless and showering them with all this constant praise often for simply saying really basic GC statements. Still with all of that said Im certainly not going to be rude or unwelcoming toward GC transsexual people especially if theyre femaleFtT.

There are lots of layers to your brain and thoughts. And not every thought means exactly what it appears to mean. This is why identifying with your thoughts can become so damaging. Youre saying you dont see men as better so that cant be the reason you want to be viewed as one but I think that the power display that comes from trauma can add nuances to this. You were put into a powerless position by someone who was a male  thats going to affect how your mind views males and the power they hold in this world. I feel theres a part of you reeling from this and looking to gain the power that was taken from you. And males represent that power. The words we use to refer to males hold that power. The word girl is technically nothing but a word  its not physical  so the reason its upsetting you has to be the connotations that come along with it. Your trauma likely equally coloured your view on women and the power they supposedly hold as well. And thats before we even get to what society tells you about women and the impact that has on you. It really just sounds like you desperately want to escape the role you were in because it was displayed to you that being in that role was extremely vulnerable.
