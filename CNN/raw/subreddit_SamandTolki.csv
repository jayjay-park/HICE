Is his judgement clouded by having a girlfriend? Probably. But constantly berating him and his girlfriend while criticizing the way she looks Despite having a medical condition is just plain cruel. Its not a discussion its bullying.Give NRDFUSION Waffle and Sovitia a break. They clearly dont want to make a comment on the matter and Waffle will end up coming back to streaming soon where Im sure hell answer a lot of questions.

5591245,0,t3_3rkm3g,The whole situation was really sad for everyone. No one really likes talking about or remembering the event because of it. I met so many amazing friends when I went to SGDQ that I still talk to all the time. They showed me a side of Twitch I never even knew existed and welcomed me warmly. Speedrunning was something that I instantly fell in love with. I spent SGDQ meeting new people and making new friends. It was a really scary event for me because I went on a whim in order to meet Sam. Even though I went to the event to just meet him I ended up meeting hundreds of other people that I never even thought Id meet. I like to think of the event as everything besides the situation that happened because of how amazing it was meeting everyone making new friends and learning about speedrunning. Ill answer these questions as best I can for you guys. You deserve some form of closure on this and even though I dont know exactly what happened Ill try my best to give you that.When you first saw Sam and Tolki at SGDQ  were they acting strange?Honestly no. I didnt really notice anything particularly strange about them when they first arrived. Though I could tell things were a bit uneasy in the way they were acting around each other especially at the dinner a bunch of us went to on that first night. You claim you were rooming with cloaked Yoshi but  day prior to SGDQ Sam confirmed with Stiv that you were rooming with them. Whats your explanation for that?I actually thought that Sam and Tolki were going to arrive on the first night of the event. I got there not realizing that they werent even going to be there till very end of the event. I ended up meeting CloakedYoshi in the lobby of the hotel on the day I arrived and he said I could stay with him for the whole event. So I did. I even set up my streaming gear in his room next to the couch I slept on for the event. Were you there the night Tolki started drinking?Yes. A bunch of us were drinking together and playing some WiiU games in various hotel rooms. Do you know who the other guys Stiv talks about are?No. I wasnt there when the whole situation went down that night. Whats the real reason why Sam left the room and left SGDQ?I think it was the drinking. When the subject of drinking came up they both commented on the idea of drinking. Though Sam said he wasnt going to drink the first night. Tolki got quite drunk to the point of vomiting Im pretty sure most likely because it was her first time drinking and she had too much. After Sam left could you sense the adultery was going to happen?After Sam left the room was a bit different. It was that time that most of us left. I think some went to go check on Sam and others to get some sleep.Are you aware of who initiated the cheating? Did Tolki come on to Stiv or did Stiv pressure her into it?Im not sure. I wasnt there when it happened so I cant really give a valid answer. Were many people attending SGDQ aware of what was going on?No one really knew what was going on. When most of us found out from rumours the following day we didnt really believe it. Rumours spread fast though and a lot of people were aware of the situation before the event ended. How did Tolki get home?She got a plane ticket home after Sam took the car home by himself. Stiv implies Sam and Tolkis marriage was falling apart prior to SGDQ. Is there any truth to this? Do you know the reasons why?I didnt know about their marriage prior to the event. It pretty obvious that there were problems after the fact but it wasnt obvious before the event. I dont really know why. It might be because of their young age or for many other reasons.Did you hear anything from either Sam or Tolki since SGDQ?No I havent heard from any of them since the event. They pretty much fell off the face of the earth after the event. Did they really get divorced? Whos decisions was it?Yes. From what I was told they are divorced. But I lost contact with them shortly after SGDQ  so Im not sure on the second part of the question thought Id guess its was probably mutual.Is there any chance either of them will ever stream again?I really dont think that will ever happen nor would it be a good idea. If youre still in contact with either of them can you tell them their fans still love them and miss them very much?Im not unfortunately but Im sure they know you guys miss them.Is there anything that you believe SVG fans dont know about SamTolki or SGDQ  that you think we should?There is a lot that you guys and I just dont know. Its pretty obvious there was marital problems before the event. I think Sam acted too rashly in the situation when he left. This whole thing wasnt the result of one big mistake it was many little mistakes that added up. Why did I delete the SGDQ  montage video?I enjoy making montage videos of events Ive been too with GDQs being one of those events. I used a song called Kindercut by SebastiAn for the SGDQ  video. I recently joined the Broadband MCN and there was a video audit done on my videos. The SGDQ video was flagged for copyrighted content. In order to join the MCN I was forced to delete the video so I did. Why dont other streamers talk about this situation?It was a pretty sad situation to be honest. Two of my friends got divorced. I never wanted to talk about it because the whole situation was pretty shitty and drama filled. I try to stay clear of drama on my stream just like many other streamers.Is it true that you dont talk to Stiv anymore and if so why if you had nothing to do with the incident?Yes. A lot of people dont. Its a respect thing. Which he lost. Was that SSX streamer CloakedYoshi working with Stiv to keep Sam out of the room?No. CloakedYoshi is a really nice guy. He saved my ass by giving me a place a stay for the entire event. He was very kind the entire event and we hung out a lot. I still talk to him and he is the same nice guy that I met back then.Did you ever truly consider Sam a friend?Yeah. He helped me through some tough times back when they were doing their month long marathon. We both watched each others streams all the time which is why I ended up going to the event to see them. Did you try to reach out to him?I did but he didnt respond at all. I gave up hope after neither of them showed up on any social media for a few months.I know that you guys probably have questions that went unanswered but honestly I dont really have the answers you want. I dont know what happened. I dont like drama and I try my hardest to stay clear of it. You guys deserve closure. Maybe this was that for some of you. It sucks that this whole thing even happened to begin with. We all lost friends and we are all on the losing side of this situation. It sucks but rather than being stuck on the past we should all try to move forward. ,SamandTolki,cwq5a5r,87,t5_33ygd

6127151,1,t3_3zg3a6,To call this an attempt implies there was ever a chance at any hooking up to begin with. This guy had absolutely no chance with either of those girls because they are lightyears out of his league. So I cant critique this as a pick up attempt the same way I cant critique someone jumping off the golden gate bridge as an Olympic dive attempt. Its simply just a disaster. Its super awkward to begin with because hes leaning so close to them despite being a seat apart. How long was he like this for? Did he realize how creepy it looked sitting like that? Then he goes in to shake their hands and they give the face like Oh god not another annoying creepy guy. Once they get the handshakes over with they completely turn away from him so he cant say anything to follow up and he awkwardly scoots back to the distance he should have been from the start. So thats my analysis of this creepy awkward exchange that happened. Just imagine all the shit like this thats going on off camera that we arent seeing. But my advice to this guy is get a haircut and hit the gym dude. Youre wearing a thermal and have  muscle definition. You want these kind of girls you need to work on yourself first. ,SamandTolki,cym3dgc,0,t5_33ygd

7384577,0,t3_4gbxnj,Ok so GrossGore is obviously an idiot and whatever but is this REALLY permaban worthy? I could see a  month ban but permaban seems a bit harsh imo.Also I know he had two warnings before this permaban but those were different issues so I feel like they didnt warrant a build up to this sort of punishment.Some people need months of suspension and they will clean up their act. I think it could set a precedent for Twitch that says they are loose with the ban hammer. This may sound good in theory i.e. other streamers will be extra careful not to cross the line but I actually think this may be a negative precedent to set.Permabans should have a ton of prestige for lack of a better word. When someone gets permabanned it should be a HUGE deal. This is the real way to deter bad acts. Just being threatened with a permaban should be enough to set people straight. If permabans are handed out over things like streamers talking bad about Twitch or its partners people mouthing off on Twitter people committing IRL crimes then it loses a lot of power.What I see happening is these growing or big streamers getting banned and just simply taking their audience to another platform. Lets be honest the only reason YouTube Gaming Hitbox and Azubu havent really got off the ground is because they have created a popular streamer yet. Once that happens shitty UIs and all that stuff wont matter. Think about how Twitch was even just  years ago. People follow content and most platform issues will get overlooked.Point is I think Twitch sort of made a mistake permabanning Gore. Like a parent they should want you to succeed and be a good representation of the community but when you fuck up they should punish you with the intention to teach you a lesson and raise the standards of the community. Permabanning anyone that fucks up doesnt do anything for the community or Twitch.,SamandTolki,d2hkr42,1,t5_33ygd

8345743,0,t3_4tw3gh,I was just reading that thread and I felt disgusted by what was being upvoted. I wanted to reply to a few of the comments and tell those people how awful it is to be downplaying sexual assault just because Hyuga apologized for it. But like you said the mods locked the thread. Luckily the mods have no power here so were allowed to discuss it with  censorship. What Hyuga did was disgusting and unforgivable. He should face a lot more consequences than just being banned from playing smash . So to see all those people on smash bros taking his side and just brushing it off as a mistake is disturbing. First of all Hyuga didnt even fucking apologize. He blamed it on being drunk and pretended like he didnt remember. Because you know if you rape someone while youre drunk its not your fault right? So I have no clue why everyone is praising him for his apology when it doesnt even exist. All hes done is make excuses and try to act like hes the victim sound familiar? But heres what I want to say about the people on the smash bros sub who are taking Hyugas side and why their comments are getting upvoted. They have done polls on that sub where they ask everyones age and every time they do the average age range is  years old. When you realize that the majority of the people there are young teens it makes a little more sense. These guys cannot grasp how fucked up sexual assault is because they have no frame of reference at all. Most of them have never had a girlfriend and most of them probably dont even have any friends who are girls. But they do have friends who play smash bros so they can relate and have empathy for Hyuga much more easily than they can for his victim. Meanwhile guys like me who are older who have been through college and known sexual assault victims we can understand how serious this is. Nerdy  year olds who never leave the house or talk to girls cant and dont understand. ,SamandTolki,d5krrz5,5,t5_33ygd

9135142,0,t3_55cpum,That plan would only work if Sam is still married to Tolki and still has control over her. I dont think Sam has either. So if he approached Tolki as his friend or whatever they are then theres no way she would agree to do that. Tolki doesnt care about us she never did. Were all a bunch of disgusting nerds to her. The only reason she ever stepped on stream in the first place was because she was following her husbands orders. Sure she would get a lot of male attention if she came back but why does she need that from twitch? After what she did at SGDQ  she knows she can get any guy she wants whenever she wants. Why would she waste her time streaming for male attention when she can go to the local clubs and get the real thing every night? When it comes to streaming theres nothing in it for Tolki anymore. The only chance we have is if Sam is streaming during one of the days he gets to hang out with her and she pops on the stream for a minute or two. But I dont think theres any way she will fully come back and do marathons again. ,SamandTolki,d89y1v2,2,t5_33ygd

10658853,0,t1_ddfdbhj,Yeah we discussed this around the time we found out for certain that they were still together. When you look back at Stivs pastebin he makes it sound like him and Tolki were going to start dating once Tolki got a divorce. Stiv mentions how after Sam left he talked with Tolki about what him and her were going to do after. He also says he kept trying to text Tolki but she was ignoring him which made him post his apology to Sam. He probably realized he had been lead on. But the question we asked was why would Tolki stay with Sam and reject Stiv even though her actions at SGDQ told the opposite? We concluded it was probably because of money. After Tolki left SGDQ she realized if she stayed with Stiv he wouldnt be able to buy her a nice luxury condo or pay her tuition. She would probably have to get a job while living in a disgusting middle class apartment. So she figured staying with Sam and basically being his roommate was worth never having to work and getting to live in luxury. ,SamandTolki,ddfdo03,4,t5_33ygd
10659068,0,t1_ddfdo03,Thanks for the info.I will disagree one one notion  Tolki was never and would never and almost all women in that situation would never go and be with stiv in a relationship.Its overused at this point but alpha fucks beta bucks.  Women have a dichotomy in their brain.  One part wants good genes one part wants security. In one night stands the woman is overcome with pure alpha fucks side of things.  She is not looking for a relationship just something primal.  Often not only will a woman not get with the man she slept with at  am the night before she will scoff at the notion of having a relationship with the man who she was fantasizing about being inseminated by as he wracked her body and brain.I think Stiv was all release no substance.,SamandTolki,ddfegsa,3,t5_33ygd

As Im sure you feel as well being someone on the spectrum change isnt fun especially when it distances you from your support network.  . I just want you to remember that you can like guys without being transgender. Ive known a few people whove made that misconception and I would hate to see you fall into the same trap.  . From what you described of your gender identity it could be possible that youre gender fluid or non binary. I would highly recommend talking to a gender therapist. I know Narcissa wasnt positively impacted by transitioning but when done with the correct therapy and guidance it has the chance to really change your life for the better. My roommate is in the process of transitioning now and Ive seen her do more thing lately for herself than I wouldve ever imagined possible she has really bad social anxiety and has managed to start going on dates and such which is huge.
