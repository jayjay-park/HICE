2810470,0,t1_cnndsfz,I just meant that theyve essentially done away with the pointsbased system and now the set people who qualify for Tier  General is much smaller. Youre already in on a work visa so your situation is somewhat different than most but I imagine you will have to talk to your HR department about this one since its not a typical circumstance. It may be possible that they can sponsor you for a different visa but Im not certain. I know a fair few people in the UK on both Tier  visas but none who switched from ICT. Look at it this way though... Theres a deliberate time limit on ICT workers and they dont want people switching to another longterm visa as a way around this. Youre probably either going to have to change your sponsor or the circumstances of your stay in the UK. I know this isnt really helpful sorry. I do hope you are able to do it.,ukvisa,cnnjih3,1,t5_32gvi
3656985,0,t1_cq93gan,unfortunately a while ago she attempted to visit an ex which resulted in her being stopped at the airport and shipped back due to her not having enough funds to support herself and her boyfriend at the time was on government funding.  We thought wed do it the safe way and make sure she is guaranteed entrance before coming over... Dont want a repeat of last time. ,ukvisa,cq94eg2,1,t5_32gvi

7136899,0,t3_4db0s9,Theres nothing that says you cant get engaged. Engagement is not an official status its just a plan between the two of you. What you cannot do is give notice with a registrar in the UK without a visa which allows it a marriage visit visa or fianc visa. The process of giving notice is what officially begins the  day waiting period before youre allowed to marry in the UK.You dont have to prove youve been in a relationship for two years if youre getting married to emigrate on a spouse or fianc visa. Thats only a requirement for unmarried partners.,ukvisa,d1pdylf,2,t5_32gvi

8383356,0,t1_d5p5riq,You should be able to switch on this route but yes youd most likely have to secure sponsorship with the university thats sponsored your Tier . I dont think youll find a university thats going to sponsor a Tier  for someone who didnt study there it seems to be a universal requirement.

8494346,0,t3_4w1zd0,Yep its a shit ton of money. They do have guidelines about which loans and scholarships you can apply toward meeting that requirement which shouldnt be too difficult to find on the UK government website. Unfortunately its possible that your loans wont be approved soon enough for them to recognize them as part of your financial requirement and youll need to have the cash in an account even if the loans will actually be paying for it. I was lucky that when my US student loans werent approved soon enough my dad could afford to leave the full amount in an account even though he wasnt actually going to be paying it. As a cautionary note when they say the full amount needs to be in your account for the full period  days or whatever it is they mean it. It cant drop below the amount at any point during that period. Good luck! ,ukvisa,d63cd8x,1,t5_32gvi

Now if she has a job in the US where she earns over that amount she can immediately move to another job in the UK and you wont have to be separated for that time.,ukvisa,d64bojk,2,t5_32gvi

We found a professional celebrant who was fantastic and we were really glad that got to personally select the officiant to perform the ceremony. She put a great deal of effort into getting to know us and our relationship and tailoring the ceremony for us it was really special and every bit our real wedding even though we got the legal bit done months earlier,ukvisa,d6mohyz,3,t5_32gvi
8745224,0,t1_d6ymfj4,Just because it doesnt make sense to you doesnt mean theres no logical reason. Remember that UKVI are not a customer service department theyre not selling you a service theyre employed by the government to regulate immigration. The reason they rolled out with a  day vignette was to satisfy EU requirements that member states must have a standard standalone residence document whereas previously visas have been issue directly into the passport. Since much in the future depends on your entry date settlement date to the UK you still need to have your passport stamped to show your date of entrysettlement and a BRP cannot be sent overseas hence the vignette. The  day window seems short but its to help make sure your BRP is collected on time and it helps keep your immigration documents relatively aligned in terms of timing.This change wasnt put in place to benefit you. Its to benefit the Home Office whose staff has been cut and yet needs to be run more efficiently with a record number of visas being issued every year. They dont care about your personal convenience.If you come to the UK with the expectation that people will bend over backward to make your life more convenient you are utterly mistaken. Your complaint email was really arrogant and uncivil and frankly presenting that kind of attitude is going to make life very difficult for you here.,ukvisa,d6yt1ne,1,t5_32gvi
8886275,0,t3_51yi99,Its more difficult to get one than it was years ago but youd need a Tier  Government Authorised Exchange visa through an approved sponsor. Youd need to apply to an authorised scheme through a specific employerfoundationexchange programmeuniversity. Check the second link for a list of authorised schemes.When its not run by a specific employer youd usually get sponsorship first and then find an internship programme afterward. BUNAC is one of the most popular and less industryspecific schemes for Americans up to  months though placement in an internship is your own responsibility after getting sponsorship. ,ukvisa,d7g06hw,1,t5_32gvi
