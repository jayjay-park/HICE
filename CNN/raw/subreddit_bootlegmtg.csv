6525805,0,t1_czua7d6,Ive never done Artscow but when I get home Ill take pictures of my cards and comparisons. The white core is great. Those are the ones with the Cradle next to a real cradle  the signature is the real one. Every other card is from Printer Studio. ,bootlegmtg,czubjgr,1,t5_3bugc
6892029,0,t1_d0x6kn3,I noticed the same thing as you just from the pics of the cards out there.. I was like wow.. thats a pretty dumb mistake to make but in researching I came across some large pics of beta power and saw the same white corners.  But its still very obvious the proxies got them wrong. The contrast is too different and the white corners are bigger then the originals.. Its just I was so surprised that those little errors actually existed on those old cards too. ,bootlegmtg,d0xj2h9,2,t5_3bugc
7037346,0,t1_d1dxkjy,Yeah Zendikar fetches and shocklands are really good and onslaught is also really top tier except for wooded foothills. Black cards except for Lili and Dark Confidant. Tarmogoyf and Snapcaster are almost perfect.,bootlegmtg,d1e1fnl,1,t5_3bugc

7584696,0,t3_4j75xq,Unfortunately there are many modern cards that do not have a good proxy version yet. Here is a complete someone correct me if Im wrong here list of the good black core proxy cards that you can find currently. I would also check the reviews on this subreddit though as some of the cards on that list are more obviously fake than others.,bootlegmtg,d34ccu0,2,t5_3bugc
7643258,0,t1_d3az6to,yeah i agree with you. i was talking to a guy who had close ties to the factory that makes the proxies. he said hes working on a way to replicate the hologram. if he succeeds with decent looking proxies of hologram only cards the whole game of proxies could change completely,bootlegmtg,d3azwgx,1,t5_3bugc

8399379,0,t3_4um15a,I think after you read this comment it wont be too difficult to figure out how this was done but I do intend on writing out or making some visual tutorial on how I did this. I think thats better than selling these proxies to people as some have already asked me to do. There are reasons for thisThese cards while they do look nice have an extra layer of thickness to them. I believe people such as VZ or BL while I havent purchased from them.. Yet advertise their cards as having the actual thickness of a Magic card and thats one of the main selling points. These cards do not have the same thickness. The other reason why I cant exactly sell these off even as proxies rather than fakescounterfeits is because the material I use has actually been discontinued meaning that the company doesnt even produce it anymore. I only have  more sheets left and after that I have to wait for thirdparty replacements to come in the mail. I will let you know if I find a good replacement. Another reason is that this process wasnt necessarily cheap to make LOL. I use an inkjet printer and I had to spend over  just for the freaking ink! So even if I were to sell these I wouldnt even know how much they would cost in order for me to make some sort of profit. Im also in no rush for any money.I will also say this. Nothing Ive done is any big secret. This method has been publicly made available on YouTube and Im sure a lot of people already know how to do this. The way I got the seal on the newer card frame however is something that I dont know if anyones figured out yet but its a VERY simple tweak to an already existing method. And the seal is very real as in if you were to inspect it it would look probably nearly identical to a real seal.Ill try and make another post on this sub for further details on how I did this as well as the printer I used the program and the settings on my computer. But yeah Id much rather pass on the knowledge on how this was done so that others can do this themselves rather than hide it from the masses lol.Oh yeah and some of you already figured it out but the right one is fake. I thought Id keep that a secret so that you guys could figure it out for yourself lol,bootlegmtg,d5rgw3z,3,t5_3bugc
8443122,0,t1_d5wcxxn,Same here I had a bad experience with that site as well. Sorry to hear that bro I eventually got a refund from paypal after no delivery and no response on hecosemtgproxies side.

10212984,0,t3_5lxk67,I built the MTGO Holiday Vintage Cube.I have a fairly large real collection and it ended up looking like  Mostly black some blue proxies from my sets.  All the power the fetches duals Portal K Legends stuff etc.  or so cards ordered from TCG and CSI everything with a value  less than card and I didnt already own.  Lots of them are only a dime.  War Priest of Thune was six cents.  Makes zero sense to proxy cards below a certain value.  cards from my existing collection many valuable some chaff.  card white core order of all the missing cards padded with a few things I wanted to use for a proxy vintage thing.White cores came from one of the Delson H storefronts whom Id bought some bulk Blue Core previously with no issue.  This particular order of white cores is supposed to come with a preset Black list ask for gift when ordering! but Im not counting on them being any good.All in all Im only counting on  or so of the white cores to finish the build  friends coughed up a few of them.  Ill be drafting it Monday live with friends.Because of the high value of my real cards in the collection Ill also be doublesleeving  cards plus  lands or so.  Thats going to cost more than I probably spent at TCG and CSI.,bootlegmtg,dc1p6zt,1,t5_3bugc

10366338,0,t3_5oa0pc,You guys arent the only ones. I ordered some cards on Nov.  and havent seen them yet. No movement on tracking. Hes sending me another package since the first is lost. A couple days before I oredered from BL I ordered some cards from another chinese vendor that Ive been getting cards from for the last  months. They were origionally on ioffer and Im pretty sure theyre from the same printer BL gets theirs from. I received those cards just before christmas. So this is not a China Post issue this is BL being incompetant since so many of us are in the same situation. Really bad first impression! ,bootlegmtg,dcj34o0,2,t5_3bugc

10523877,0,t3_5q22oj,I just make my own proxies to avoid shipping costs and overpriced low quality counterfeits. I print off at Staples self serve printing from USB high quality scans formatted to the right size by a Scribus template and turned into a PDF use a spray on glue to adhere them to card stock then cut them out and play in sleeves. Feelslooks pretty much like the real thing and in sleeves the blank backs dont matter. Paid about  including the cost of printing card stock and glue for four copies of the full Unlimited set for  cards thats about  cents a card.,bootlegmtg,dd0zulc,1,t5_3bugc

10976220,0,t1_dec4u9g,Card texture and feel on CM is better ultimately image quality on BL can be better however it is really hit or miss sometimes you just get junk with  or  great cards. Caveat time though this is improving and his quality is getting consistent.On a side note Cardmire does custom orders for the same price so his selection is currently unmatched. However custom cards come at a risk as they are not quality controlled to the same level nor does he have the same experience with them.I personally prefer CM however thats a lot to do with the positive experiences with his customer service.,bootlegmtg,dec59s4,2,t5_3bugc
