1481597,0,t3_2ap6qy,There are so many levels on which this particular request is not possible. In my testing owning and quite enjoying Four Swords Adventures the two most popular GameCube backup loaders DIOS MIOS and Devolution will both run the game. Im not sure if Devolution allows you to use Wii Remotes as GameCube controllers missing a bunch of buttons at this point but it will let you use Classic Controllers connected to Wii Remotes. FSA itself only allows you to use a standard controller recognized ingame as a GameCube controller for ONE PLAYER playing single player mode. For any type of multiplayer gameplay all players MUST have their own GBA and GBAtoGameCube link cable connected to one of the GameCube ports.Devolution will allow you to use a Classic Controller which will be recognized by the game as a GameCube controller for the singleplayer game but Devolution also requires you to verify that you have the physical disc present the first time that you boot up the game. As far as I know Wiis that dont have GameCube ports are also incapable of reading GameCube discs so you wouldnt be able to load to the game without using a workaround that requires you to bring the physical disc to a second hacked Wii with Devolution installed that does have the GameCube portscompatibility make sure that your own Wii Remote is connected to the second Wii before starting the game and it will store the verification file to your Remote which you can then take back home to your GC portless Wii and verify that way. This is entirely dependent on either having another hacked Wii with GameCube ports or knowing someone with a hacked Wii with GameCube ports.For multiplayer you need physical GBAtoGC cables and GBAs plugged into GameCube ports. DIOS MIOS  which ONLY can use Wii GameCube ports for controls  is capable of handling this Devolution is apparently not so Devolution can only play single player. Your Wii doesnt have GameCube ports so either way the point is moot  you will probably not be able to play the game at all. Hate to be the bearer of bad news.tldr You cant find a worthwhile multiplayer game for the Wii itself instead,WiiHacks,cj1zs8i,1,t5_2rh8x

I would first rule out either something on your router blocking internet to the wii or possibly an issue with the wifi adapter inside the wii itself before assuming that because the wii was hacked Nintendo blocked access to the eShop.I have personally never seen read about or heard of a softmodded wii being blocked by nintendo especially one blocked from accessing the eShop but that doesnt mean it is impossible just highly unlikely.I didnt mean to come across as demeaning but its hard to measure a random internet strangers level of competency with these things and your earlier assumption that Netflix was not an official app led me to start the are you sure it is plugged in approach.,WiiHacks,cp1itiu,2,t5_2rh8x

4559668,0,t3_3dhvcm, You need a Wii remote to use the console. Its nonnegotiable  all the other peripherals plug into the things. Additionally I recommend shelling out the money for an official Wii Remote Plus and official Nunchuck  unofficial versions can be quite buggy with homebrew stuff. You would have trouble playing most of the Wiis library without a Nunchuck as well  the majority of the systems games require it.  Yes. Look at the Complete Softmod Guide in the subreddits sidebar  it tells you everything you need to know. The package youre looking for is called Nintendont for GameCube games N Virtual Console games are packaged as WADs specific to your console region PALNTSC. Most USB loaders dont support booting larger N games from EmuNand look it up yourself do the legwork like the rest of us so youll either have to install them to internal memory or set up a Sneek EmuNand you can boot to specifically for your Virtual Console games. Its only an issue for the largest N titles like Majoras Mask though I just went and got my old N out and played a real copy instead when faced with jumping through those hoops. Its trivial to find Linux WBFS managers for Wii games but you absolutely dont need to format your drive as WBFS anymore. FAT is the preferred filesystem for Wii backups now WBFS files can split disc images to get around the file size limit. The process of setting up GameCube games and earlier is easy enough to pick up by putting in the legwork of simply reading the guides linked from the subreddits sidebar.  There isnt any real downside to being on the latest System Menu version. All the versions are vulnerable to standard homebrew exploits  if you can find yourself a copy of Super Smash Bros. Brawl trivial youre guaranteed to be able to get homebrew running. If you dont want to go down that route check up the different methods of installing the Homebrew Channel again in the Complete Softmod Guide linked in the sidebar. Its a trivial process. I just used it to backup my disc collection before my disc drive failed  didnt really look into it all that much beyond that. ,WiiHacks,ct5d3w3,2,t5_2rh8x

Not only do they not have the needed ports or the right footprint but those are Power PC systems while the GBA is an ARM with a Z coprocessor. Like uRenaKunisaki said the Game Boy Player is the entire GBA. All the Gamecube really provides are controls and videoaudio output.And seriously actual Gamecubes are dirt cheap. The GB Player with a disc is a tad more expensive but last I checked its quite possible to get the entire package for less than . If you have a way to get homebrew running on a Gamecube you can forgo the disc entirely pick up one without it for the price of lunch and run this sucker on there. Supposed to be a nicer experience than the official disc too.Also I recommend getting an SNES controller with a Gamecube port adapter. Much better for D games than the stock Gamecube controller.

8312216,0,t1_d5gdzci,If youre not even able to load the emuNAND then you probably cant use Save Game Manager GX. You could try going into the NAND settings on USB Loader GX say and using the option there to dump Miis to emuNAND. Assuming the Miis are on the physical Wii youd then get them on your emuNAND.

8719793,0,t3_4yhrhx,The Wii can read NTFS but it is not optimal for compatibility or performance. FAT as youre aware has a GB file restriction  Most Wii games are under this size but some dual layer games like Brawl are as large as GB. Wii Backup Manager can split the ISO so it can be copied to a FAT drive. I would format your SD card or HDD to FAT then use Wii Backup Manager to transfer the ISOs. ,WiiHacks,d6vm4p8,1,t5_2rh8x

11665375,0,t3_66g7d5,First format your USB stick or external HDD to Fat with kb clusters.Then make a folder on your USB stick or HDD called wbfs.Get Wiibackup ManagerOpen WiiBM and under Drive  select drive letter of the USB stick or HDD. Now under the Files tab select Add and find your iso.It should come up as the name of the game and game ID.Make sure the box to the left of the game is checked off and select Transfer and Drive .Let it do its business and eject it pop it in your Wii and let USB loader GX take it from there.You can repeat this process for any subsequent Wii games that are  over GB. For games under GB you dont need WiiBM and you can just make a properly labeled folder in the wbfs folder and rename the iso to game.iso and put it there yourself. WiiBM can do it for you if you prefer not too. The main reason to use WiiBM besides convenience is it can automatically split Wii game isos that are above the Fat GB file size limit.  My original Mario Kart Wii profilelicense came right up recently after not playing it for years using a backup iso instead of the original disc which wouldnt read anymore.,WiiHacks,dgiaa7q,2,t5_2rh8x
