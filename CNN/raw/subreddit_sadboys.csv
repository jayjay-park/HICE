600855,0,t1_cg8g8wk,I did it. Every  is a song.Apparently Tiger came to be by him rerecording a verse on a really bad old song of his and then having Whitearmor making a new less serious beat to go with it.He says Tigers sound is unique on his mixtape. He says its his one of his own favourites and that he doesnt care about people who say they dont understand what hes saying in it.After Migos he says he loves their flow that its like Futures but more onpoint also enjoys their lyrics. They are real trendsetters with their flow.He says his own flow depends on his mood during the time of the recording.After the Future song he says he always destroy songs by listening to them too much like Hard in da Paint and Versace. Hes apparently called Swedens Soulja Boy by Emilio Faggone Sad Boys manager and Thaiboy himself agrees on that.He loves autotune it makes things better. Because it gives you more stuff to listen in a song and that people who cant sing are able to by using autotune like Chief Keef. People hate autotune because theyre conservative and need things to be real in order to enjoy it and that you need talent to be able to sing. Autotune allows you to be creative in a new way and its modern.The interviewer asked if he ever feels like hes crossing boundaries when he makes music and he says he feels like he does that a lot examples being Fuck U. The lyrics make no sense the melody makes no sense but the songs feeling makes sense and thats all his music is about the feeling.He started making music in a serious way last summer people started hating because it sounded pretty bad. Last winter he decided to add autotune and now you can catch him on podcasts. Started from the bottom now he here.He described Gravity Boys like a bunch of nice people that help each other out. First he thought theyd be like Migos everybody featured on every track but now its more like GBE with Chief Keef everyone doing their own thing and occasiounally helping each other out on tracks.Nothing really happens after the Kevin Gates song.Describing boppin he says its an easy dance where you just go low with them knees and go left to right. There are several levels of boppin the amateur one where you just turn your knees left to right the exclusive boppin where you do things with your hands and twirl and move around and next level boppin where you do flips and stuff. She asks who in GTB and Sad Boys are best at boppin. Yung Sherm is very good at it but Eccok is the best one Bladee and Whitearmor are probably the worst.Conclusively he says the mixtape will be finished when Whitearmor returns from the tour.,sadboys,cg8kjxk,14,t5_2xpx7

3423205,0,t1_cpi8mvc,When asked in his interview with KEXP what his reaction was to Ginseng Strip  gaining traction on youtube when it hit a  million views or so he responded that he didnt care one bit. He said that no matter how popular or unpopular his music is that sadboys are going to continue making music the same way they always have and they will never let any fame or fortunate dictate their direction not to say it wouldnt help them get more producersguest artists on board but you get the point. Unknown Memory would have moreorless been the same perhaps just released a bit earlier due to the lack of touring if they were still moreorless unknown.He literally refuted this exact point doesnt seem like youre that much of a fan if you didnt know that... I understand your concern though its hard for artists to stay true to their creative direction if they have the potential to get a bunch more praisemoney doing something else. But who knows if sadboys didnt get the fame they did they might not have been able to drop out of school to pursue music. They probably would have grown up went to different colleges etc. and moved on. Id be thankful for their semimainstream success honestly.,sadboys,cpigy74,3,t5_2xpx7

Adam said he likes to go for people on the come up that dont have much info on them and Im sure Bladee Adamn and Sherm meet that expectation. Hes heavy on views and shit so Im sure hed love the attention thatd follow. As for us we pretty much just have to comment interview Sadboys on everything and hell do it.
