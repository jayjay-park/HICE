733924,0,t1_cgni75d,I love Netsky! And Camo amp Krooked were as close as DC last year. Id say unlikely for Hudson but not impossible.The UK DnB I realistically could see being added would be Andy C Sub Focus or maybe Chase amp Status. Any of those would round out the lineup perfectly! Also TC would be incredible a personal favorite. ,HudsonMusicProject,cgnp90k,3,t5_30zty
953522,0,t1_chbacaj,i was thinkin about those  names. but i just think since its tNDs first show in years that they get a mainstage slot and same with sts. just better for mainstage. both could easily be latenight too tho,HudsonMusicProject,chco9a8,1,t5_30zty

1387644,0,t1_ciq239j,I emailed them with  questions and they answered one and ignored the one about cigs soooo pretty sure they are discussing how to handle the situation and not saying anything because they are realizing how stupid this rule is. ,HudsonMusicProject,ciq81i5,2,t5_30zty
1445265,0,t3_2aomkr,Clean porta potties compared to other fests  Free keurig coffee  Good food Im a vegan and they had a shitload of options for me which is unusual  Music was pretty on point IMO.  STS was on fire Bonobo was great Conspiritor was great.  Also had a great time at Griz although Ive heard much better sets from him and I though excision was on point as well. I cant really say I saw a bad set all weekend.,HudsonMusicProject,cixfuzz,6,t5_30zty
