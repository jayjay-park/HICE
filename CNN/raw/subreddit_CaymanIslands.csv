2555817,0,t3_2p07kw,Also it should be said Sting Ray City is pretty good bang for the buck. From a few years ago I remember it being like  US and usually leave about a  US tip. Most boats take you to Sting Ray City and then the reef to snorkel or in reverse order reef then Sting Ray City. Total of about  hours. Moby Dick Tours was my favorite when I lived there. Small boats and great staff.,CaymanIslands,cms6l2x,5,t5_2udok
