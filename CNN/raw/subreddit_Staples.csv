So the DM decides to leave the larger store open so what does that do? It can allow for further growth in the company for other associates. They can get better positions and allow more people into the company.I dont hate Staples for this. You make it sound like this is the worst thing to ever happen.

611385,0,t1_cg9m2bq,   How much effort.... You would be surprised  usually it is not the cashiers fault but the customers. They have to verify the right email addy with the customer  which can take some time considering the mentality of some of them.Then they have to explain the pass  again even when explained well a lot of customers have questions then there is overcoming objections..... This is all in addition to looking up  different phone numbers for the idiots rewards.TLDR  doing both for each customer adds minutes to each transaction  not good for quick checkout. So the extra effort usually means pulling an OS associate away from the floor to ring back up. Commission     Correct  but for how long??  Simplexity  Wirefly was shady  look them up.The commitment to customer service is just lip service. If it were genuine they would have been giving stores more payroll all along.Right now all this crap is simply rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.  The ship is going down.

2173693,0,t1_clg2mmz,The only solution to stores that get  ship to store orders a day is to literally tell customers when they come to pick up Hey just so you know the free shipping applies to home delivery too. Most customers DONT know thanks to how the website advertises Free ship to store on everything even when home delivery is pretty much always free too.When placing dot comkiosk orders for customers you also have to pretty much not offer ship to store. Just tell them youll have it at their doorstep in X days. Much easier and takes the decision making out of the customers head. If they ask if they can have it shipped to the store for security reasons by all means do it but always offer ship to home first. My old tech supervisor would always do ship to store and wed have legit  orders per day on top of all the other stuff we would horde in lockup Cant trust cashiers with BOPIS at the service desk.

3038713,0,t3_2uy4wq,The older stores that did not get remodels are better off because they have ft tall aisle in almost every section in OS.This makes it easier to put overstock right above where it goes on the shelf. Newer stores were built with whole sections of ft tall fixtures which obviously limit overstock and midstock space and force you to put overstock product in entirely different areas.Training is a whole different matter. HR and DMs constantly bitch and moan about outstanding trainings when its the flavor of the month and nothing else to bitch about. Yet corp seems to have no problem taking away training payroll for new hires. Then there is the issue of staffing in general.  Trucks are forced out and untrained new hires and disgruntled veterans just start putting freight where ever and taking tags down and making their own pogs for things.It all boils down to the IS having to do twice as much work for the ZB and returns and cycle counts and then shit rolling down hill because the ZB walks are systemically high across the company.TLDR  If corp provided the correct amount of payroll in the first place stores would run more effectively.  ,Staples,cocym8q,2,t5_2t2e3

Two other good associates were scheduled beyond their two weeks so they went down as no shows even though they gave a clear date. And thats not even getting into the way the corporate shits on the store associates or that I get paid like absolute crap. So no they wont be getting my two weeks notice and Im never going to look back. There are  other retail chains that you can go work for and be treated like crap and some of them might even pay you something worth your time.,Staples,ctaeji0,11,t5_2t2e3

When the prices changed from the  setup to flat  across the board Barring VRRestore I had to retake the training and again it states up to  hours total is expected between travel and work being done. And that each addon service netted the customer an extra hour of time. These were also the hours of labor we would accumulate toward TechCOT hours.Where people are coming from with You get an hour of my time is lolwtf to me. There was a specific SKU for  hour of personal training that was hour but that was completely different than the other services being offered because its more customized and whatnot.Only other caveat to onsites was that there was an extended trip fee Cant remember the exact name not talking about the  Trip ChargeValet SKU that was put out later on for any destination more than  miles away.

4710395,0,t3_3fg0lz,Work around is to do the work yourself instore.The downside is most stores will be missing one of  things. Manager support.Associate confidence to repair a laptop wo causing damage. Customer participation. is your customer willing to buy parts outside of staplesand take that liability on willing to agree to a time frame that could be weeks or sometimes upto a month or more to complete. Take the risk that it will not complete and end in a partial refund wo a working machine at the end if anything above cant be satisfied. What corporate wants though is not an out of the box thinker. They want to empty that wallet as soon and as efficiently as possible. So the correct answer would be to regretfully inform the customer that the depot is unable to secure parts for your model and therefore are unable to repair it. Our only option to get you back up and running is with a new computer.,Staples,ctoa82e,7,t5_2t2e3

Id love to hear your thoughts on employees taking it upon themselves to look up cheap prices that competitors are offering using that price difference without customers knowledge to sell a discounted total solution.  Taking  off a . printer costing . and replacing it with  add ons that cost  to Staples takes money from bottom line and seems like a skeevy sales tactic.  Thoughts?

5334180,0,t1_cvta34p,Coincidentally Ive found the exact opposite on the credit card part. I alway make sure I mention that its a card so that the customer knows what it is up front and isnt scared off when we get to where you enter the Social and they still think its a store rewards card.  Usually my pitch comes in at the end before the total something like  And just so you guys know since your order is over  today if you signed up for the Staples More Credit Card youd get  off your purchase automatically. So instead of  itd be  plus youd get your rewards card upgraded so you get  instead of . The nice part about the  is that you dont have to go chasing it down since its taken right off the first statement so you dont have to do anything to get it.Sometimes if theyre getting something like a printer I like to throw in that the  basically pays for their inktoner so itd be like getting free ink for about X months. Ive found that by mentioning all of this the discount tends to seem a bit larger than it really is. So by saying that they get  that their purchase could be  instead of  or whatever the price is and that that would basically make their first toner or ink free it seems like theyre getting a lot more free than they really are.

9392017,0,t1_d96g3j3,What kind of ridiculous programs are you guys going through? Here are a couple of ours. Cutting labor hours and then asking for things that waste labor hours but that the customers never notice. We want this place to look open move this top stock to that top stock. Meanwhile the customers never notice the top stock even if a giant laser printer was teetering and about to fall on them and we ignore customers to move printers from one place to another.  Liquid Armor  This is apparently someone at corporates pet project.  I can understand why they want us to sell it the cost on it is  and it sells for . Still they press it so hard that our GMs panic if we dont sell enough. So we focus on liquid armor potentially taking a loss on laptops credit cards and other potentially more important and valuable things to sell the hot product of the moment. I understand encouraging us to sell it but theyre making it such a big deal its distracting us from other things. Due to the aforementioned hours cut and all the things we have to do to keep the store in shape random item location changes which require we take two associates and move all the shelving  feet within the same aisle take all the items off the pegs put them in a buggy and restock them a few feet away. Ill admit I dont know if moving them to a more prime location a few feet away within eyeline makes them more appealing to customers but we spend a bit of tiem on moving this stuff while ignoring customers and if we allocate extra hours to it were not meeting labor goals. Aisles that have no semblance of organization either for customers or associates.  I recently got a very slight respect for the planner aisle. It is at least organized by daily weekly monthly academic etc. but the pattern could really make more sense if we want to keep it organized.  Hewlett Packard toner on the other hand is a nomans land.  is close to  but theyre both ont he bottom shelf and the numbers are all over the place.   something is on the left side while  is on the right and  something is somewhere in the middle.  That section should really be organized like our ink wall. On the ink wall each manufacturer has its zone and these zones are in numerical order. Occasionally a new cartridge will come in that winds up in a slightly odd place but its generally close to its numerical counterparts.  There are a couple of other issues but these are the ones we are dealing with now and most employees at the bottom level can see how theyre affecting store level profits. Even if Staples keeps up its BB business this is damaging to the retail profit side of things. ,Staples,d96i6o8,1,t5_2t2e3

They would always set the goals unrealistically high so stores would increase sales by trying but not hit the goals usually.

11123084,0,t3_5yrfsw,. Contract customers have corporate pricing. When you look them up in solution builder there will be a green contract icon about their name. They do pay they just get really good pricing. Sometimes orders come through flight deck that were submitted online. The order tickets will tell you if its paid online or not. . Copyright is a federal law. You cannot break it regardless of what the customer says unless they have a release from the original creator i.e. Disney Marvel DC Comics Nickelodeon shows NFLNBANCAA etc. Etsy and Pinterest do not have rights to those whether the customer bought them a design or not. Staples could get fined  and you could lose your job.. The wide format rolls take some getting used to. The stickers inside the rolls like someone else mentioned help. I organized our paper spindel by types and sizes of rolls so its easier for my new people  heavyweight goes in front of the  heavyweight and it is like that for all my roll types. They are also labeled at the base so if someone isnt sure where it goes they can see.. Tips and tricksLearn your regulars and use their names especially the ones that spend lots of money Use the wikis on the hub and the PMS forums if you have access to them. Lots of useful stuff in there and Home Office occasionally replies with the right info or how toGet familiar with the web submission process for customers as you will get people who call and need help. Also get familiar with flight deck and fast. Solution builder adoption how many of your transactions were generated in solution builder versus the register has to be over  so never use the register to ring up a new order unless your solution builder is completely down. Your copy center is graded on this metric. Always try to upsell and convert to color. Try to print a sample if possible to help with this. Also when designing something always get the customer to sign off on the final proof or whatever it is you are doing. I have lost so many dollars because of redos because someone didnt get the customer to sign and they came back and demanded a redo. Of the same damn thing they left with. There is much more but I dont want to overload you. Good luck and dont let customers get to you. Never take it personal and always get a manager involved if a customer becomes irate. ,Staples,dessjdf,1,t5_2t2e3

Customer then goes why is there a recycle sticker on my printer I still need it and only brought it to make sure I get the right ink umm why the whole printer. The biggest one I have seen do this was a HP . Thats a pretty good size printer to lug around every time you need new ink. Some of these people also want us to replace the cartridges.

11485695,0,t1_dfxvl3u,Na...It was an allinone and I my  foot long bench was full as it was. Plus they were well within the return policy and to be honest I was glad to have the second basket on top of the nd onsite. Probably should have taken more time with it in the beginning but they wanted a new machine that hadnt been hacked and I didnt really want to argue with a good customer. I assumed it was such a weird issue that it would go away.....That was a mistake.I had worked on the laptop before and I had a good image of the HDD because he had some specialized software that was very expensive. So I just reimaged the laptop each time he brought it in. I think I tried a reset in the allinone but she was adamant that the normal network connections were hackers. But it says that it is listening and waiting. It has to be a hacker! Netstat was the worst thing she had ever seen ,Staples,dfxwh82,2,t5_2t2e3

After my first day running copy center by myself were a small store and usually only have one person there I got to my car and cried for a half hour.  As a  year old male i wish i could say that was the last time that happened. Its overwhelming and it doesnt really stop being overwhelming but you do get better at handling it. This is a very thankless job unless you count staples stars points. ,Staples,dgwl205,3,t5_2t2e3
