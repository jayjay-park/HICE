10582543,0,t1_dd71hcq,I appreciate it! And yeah Ive always wanted to add drums and more instruments to my stuff. Its mostly just a matter of not having access to drums or a way to even record them. Ive got a bedroom studio with just two inputs so Im pretty limited. Maybe one day!,songamonth,dd7iaab,2,t5_37qw3
10846223,0,t1_ddrhzw2,I like the tune a lot. I never wouldve noticed its in  time if you hadnt pointed it out. Agree the drum transition needs work but I like the idea of building up the song as you go along. The tune reminds me pouring rain on a gray day in the city so some thunderous drums would sound just right IMO.,songamonth,ddypmrx,2,t5_37qw3
