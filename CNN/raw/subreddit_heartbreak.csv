8048300,0,t3_4ne5v1,Agreed. I was going through this and now am second guessing every time she told me she loved me. I think I was one of at least two people she was telling that to. Im sorry this happened to you.,heartbreak,d4kpdct,1,t5_2rcye

11027247,0,t3_5vaino,The problem is you dont need someone else to move on you dont need to find someone new. You lasted this long alone you dont need a girl to complete you!Let me tell you this now it doesnt get easier you will miss her maybe even more and more every day but you need to know that you have been and will be fine without her. You dont really get over someone if you truly did love them but you do learn to live without them and time eventually heals all. Heart break break ups are a part of life unfortunately. Everyone will go through it. You might feel like noone can compare to her but you probably didnt even know she was what you wanted until she came along whos to say someone else might not come along and be exactly what you need but didnt think you need? Stop looking for someone and the right person will appear!Some people arent meant to be in our lives forever and just think about it you are one heart break closer to finding the right person.,heartbreak,dehwwb0,2,t5_2rcye
