5656653,0,t3_3skmi1,HiGamer tag TheBloggsterConsoles DS Wii  and XboneInterests Gaming PCs Technology in general Xbox stuff Films Cricket YouTube etc. Ive been transfixed by Halo since my first game. My first game was when a friend brought his Halo Reach disc to my house for a partyfriend over type thing. At that time I was not on Xbox Live and Ive never played anything that is futuristic so it was confusing at first but it was super fun. I got the game the next week and had a blast with the campaign. Got Xbox live that summer and have been playing with my friends ever since. I got into the lore immediately when I started I was quite confused as to who the Master Chief was because I started with Reach I now know dont worry but now Im currently reading through the books and have watched all the cutscenes and gameplay for all the halo games about  to  times while in the back of a car on the way to some place. The characters and backstories behind them has intrigued me since day  and I try and know more about the franchise and the underlying plots that have only been hinted at in dialogue but have never been returned to like the Halo CE Guilty Spark cutscene. Im also a avid watcher of Red vs Blue because you know.... its awesome. And Ive got to say the end of Season  almost made me cry. Again Ive watched them all about  times it never gets old.  Im also going to be building my first Gaming PC soon so Ill be joining the PC community too and hoping to start a YouTube channel which cover both PC and Xbox gaming with some gameplay from both and hoping some entertaining videosAnd thats it basically it. Gaming has changed my life I think for the better and I have a great bunch of friends who Im not afraid to go all out halo lore on them so yeah. I always watch your video and I always find your advice to be useful and your opinions  to be solid and l always agree. Keep up the great work and I see you in the future. I found you when I just was browsing through YouTube for some Halo videos. You seem to know a lot of stuff about Halo and at that time I wanted to know more about Halo for here we are.  This was around the end of Halo  December . Your HTMCC videos made me click that subscribe button ,ReadyUpLive,cwy9h0g,1,t5_397fg
