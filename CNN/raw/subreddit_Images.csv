1919148,0,t1_ckk81yy,Well I was taking you seriously until your last  words. How does it feel to know you can go to a hospital or dr and know youll be looked after?   I bet its a whole lot better than being layed in a hospital bed with wires everywhere your newborn layed next to you while your dying.  I had only knowen my son for a few minutes before I started to die right next to him. Id say it broke my heart but by then it was already pretty fucked. By that point id been going to the doctor for  years and got nothing but the same three tests.They could have prevented it or at least known about a problem but no. They didnt care. Every time my heart freaks out for no reason I have to lay there helpless white my son worries and my husband wonders why no one will help. Id gladly pay for us all to have piece of mind that im not going to die. Every time it happens I could die! Thats fucking terrifying! Doctors just wont help. I had to move my whole life just to find a doctor who would allow me to see a cardiologist. Thats only  problem. I could tell you hundreds of times the nhs has failed.   Maybe I should tell you about the local three year old boy with neuroblastoma. The nhs refuse to save him because well hes not worth their money.  His parents are literally begging for help to get  to go to America just so he can have a shot at life.They need to pay too because the nhs is too cheep.

College does not universally provide the benefits you described but what it certainly does provide is a centralized location where those benefits can be accessed if one were to seek them out.

Mostly older stuff but also some newer stuff. It is mind numbing to me that this is still the case.

4624502,0,t3_3ec6fj,Alan a  year old from Northen Ireland set off with  of his friends on the holiday of a lifetime to Ibiza on Saturday. Then tragedy hit Alan wasnt in Ibiza even  hours before his passing. On Sunday evening his friends discovered he had passed in his room. His death has been put down to natural causes by the Spanish police but others have suggested there is more to this story. Alans friends have held two memorial services for Alan  one in Ibiza and one at a local park in front of the sea. During this they played Alans favourite trance song by Above and Beyond  Satelite. Alans friends are trying to create awareness and fundraise to help his family to cover the costs of bringing his body home.

I didnt think you would just come right out and admit your plan that plainly. Either youre not a real person and youre illustrating a point or youre just that dense.You as an individual are getting taxed more in an attempt to even out our outrageous wealth imbalance that is quickly killing our economy and youre literally going to sidestep that and make your employees pay your taxes. It should be clear to you that as long as the guy in charge is allowed to do shit like this there is no taxation that will fix us.Basically the overall point you are making is this tax plan wont work people are inherently selfish we need government intervention so people like me dont fuck peoples lives over.Can you do your employees a favor and let them read this thread? Or at least tell them I am not taking a pay cut for anyone so you all are going to pay my taxes. After all in a freemarket economy it is their prerogative to know what their employer is up to and decide for themselves if they want to continue working for you.God every day I slip into the comforting thought that theres no way anyone could be that shitty of a person and then along comes you completely unaware at how you are ruining our country. I guess thats it you just dont know. The yous of the world just. dont. know. Its like youre a sociopath. Jesus christ youve ruined my day now.,Images,cz8kiv5,12,t5_2qtjz
