And this we bear record with words of soberness that the said Smith has shown unto us for we have seen and hefted and know of a surety that the said Smith has got the plates of which we have spoken. And we give our names unto the world to witness unto the world that which we have seen. And we lie not God bearing witness of it.Christian WhitmerJacob WhitmerPeter Whitmer Jun.John WhitmerHiram PageJoseph Smith Sen.Hyrum SmithSamuel H. Smith,theBOM,da4ldpb,1,t5_3hlpz
