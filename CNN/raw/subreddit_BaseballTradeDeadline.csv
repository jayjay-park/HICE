5865333,0,t1_cxofd7s,Over  years ago I a youthful and ignorant me asked my father how the midsummer Phillies are doing this year. He said theyre only a couple of games back in the division right now! A young me knowing nothing about baseball replied So they have a good chance at winning the World Series?  Just a few months later I was celebrating the  World Champions and the birth of my baseball interest.Now Im not saying I jinxed the Phillies into winning the World Series. But did the Texas governor jinx the Astros? How many licks does it take to get the center of a tootsie pop? Is Lenny Dykstra for real? We will never know the answer. Anyway  years later I am now a proud member of the rPhillies subreddit. Despite rage quitting my baseball interests after watching Ryan Howard fall down whilst ending the  ALDS for three years the subreddit brought me back to interest in our  team. And thanks to this deal I am here to stay.I may not be a good human being. I may be a shitty baseball player except at speed contact and defense looking at you high school coach. I may be a shitty at being funny. I may be shitty at not being funny. I may be a shitty karmawhore. But in words of the legendary Harold Reynolds He plays the game the right way and thats all that matters. I will be here for every up vote party. I will be here for every trade rumor discussion. I will be here to trash Amaro even years after he is gone. And I am proud to say this thanks to this deal.I will now answer any questions about me my career with this subreddit or Metallica.,BaseballTradeDeadline,cxoh58j,3,t5_398ru
