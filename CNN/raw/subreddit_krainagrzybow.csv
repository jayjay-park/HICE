2723335,0,t1_cndk9gp,If Im not mistaken I think this is the first time weve definitely seen Caroline and Maggie Gretal Malgosia whatever you want to call her in some way together. In the first book excerpt  we definitely saw he talking to a big squirrel but it appeared to be male judging from the way it kept referring to itself as your mothers lover now we can definitely confirm interaction between the two of them as well as Agatha.The plot thickens.,krainagrzybow,cndmqyt,1,t5_30jn3

11347699,0,t3_61sdm8,Its been over one and a half years since the release of the last PU. I wonder if their creative style has changed since then. It may have given that there was a marked difference between the styles of PU  and PU . What we have already seen from PU in forms of gifs and images look quite different from what we could see in the previous PUs thats probably because of this jarring red background.,krainagrzybow,dfi8ox3,3,t5_30jn3

11429368,0,t3_63058b,My theory is that in the beginning there was no theory. The KGTV team just made the first two PUs with a view to making an impression creating hauntological atmosphere all the hints to nuclear stuff is also present in BritishAmerican hauntology branches reminding some people of their childhood etc.  everything what hauntology is about. They also seem to have been influenced by a creepypasta format. Anyway when they released the episodes they noticed that people were making up stories and theories behind KG. It struck the KG team as interesting so they started to incorporate elements from various theories into the later PUs rape kidnapping mental disorder etc.,krainagrzybow,dfri909,6,t5_30jn3
