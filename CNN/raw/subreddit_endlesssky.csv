5985677,0,t3_3xfl0o,You cant currently but I would like the ability to have a secondary fleet just making money so I can fly around in my war Bactrians without a care.,endlesssky,cy4957o,2,t5_39rfp
7882200,0,t1_d40q89v,Your fleet is just fine short of planetary conquest the game doesnt spawn fleets large enough to make you break much of a sweat. The aliens only have to destroy your ship to ruin the day. You may start to notice a few empty systems around the edges of human space. I encourage you to find a way there. You may have to think a little unconventionally.,endlesssky,d4216od,2,t5_39rfp
8335641,0,t1_d5j3egu,Well I found out that the engines have better thruststreer to outfit space ratio than normal nuclear or Hai engines.If you have the extra cooling which you just made some space for you can totally pull it off until ou get something better.Next time Ill go for power source and cooling.,endlesssky,d5jid1v,1,t5_39rfp
8337305,0,t1_d5jid1v,Yeah that engines are AWESOME but to equip a whole fleet will be really hard. Best way is to first kill a lot of quarg with the fleet until they all have a jump drive move them to a place with an outfitter in the Kor area and just looting the ships and not capturing them. The power source just makes WAAAAY to much heat for me to bother balancing xD I prefer the wanderer power sources because I dont need to worry about cooling very much and if Im using projectile weapons that dont fire continuously it means I dont need to install batteries or if I dont produce more power than I use all the time I will have some buffer without sacrificing space. Using small biochem generators are PERFECT for fightersRambaling FTW P,endlesssky,d5jpuby,1,t5_39rfp
10885822,0,t1_de2obkx,There is nothing in the release notes saying that you cant but I have not had a chance to test this myself. ,endlesssky,de2sms6,3,t5_39rfp
10890960,0,t1_de37xtq,Short answer No.Long answer Yes but it involves leading Quarg ships into Coalition space letting them fight and then patching up the Heliarch ships to gain rep with them. Its a very slow process and its probably not worth it but its possible.,endlesssky,de3bpw5,2,t5_39rfp
11104234,0,t1_deqj7sf,Agreed. The Bactrian that you pilot will be with you for a long time. You make it as nimble as possible and eventually you can ditch all weapons because unarmed ships are considered lowpriority by combat AI. You can switch between outfit space and bunks or cargo space depending on whether youre capturing or looting. Theres a lot of handwringing over how the bactrian is mandatory as a flagship even in the lategame when every other ship in the fight is superior.The other bactrians in your fleet have a special quality that lets them hang on longer than even a Dreadnought cram that enormous cargo full of nuclear reactors and shield generators and pack the turret spots with antimissile weapons or certain other technologies youll encounter later. The high shield regen lets it make up for the merely human shield strength so that it can live a long and happy life as a support ship.,endlesssky,deqnltt,5,t5_39rfp
11362642,0,t3_625sw3,gtThanks  One dude with unpopular opinions FTFYEdit If you have any actual bug reports feel free to post them on the Steam discussion group for them. If you want better trading and moneymaking I suggest that you code it yourself  the game is open source for a reason.,endlesssky,dfjxmuk,4,t5_39rfp
11362763,0,t3_625sw3,interesting ways to make money plunder until you have thousands of Sparrows loot Quarg ships and use their tech on your Sparrows,endlesssky,dfjy4l0,5,t5_39rfp
11512088,0,t1_dfzup1b,Adding to that when youre in the shipyard and I think also in the outfitter youll see icons in the top right representing all your ships. You can select and sell or outfit any ship individually. Also you can drag the icons around and whatever ship is first in the list is the ship you pilot.,endlesssky,dg0waww,1,t5_39rfp
