1297022,0,t1_ciffcyi,You know whats weird? Our Jack had a scruffy broken coat all over when he was younger not as shaggy as this lady. Our Jack is now . and hes outgrown this shagginess!! Nowadays he has a small patch of broken coat on his back but is smooth everywhere else. ,jackrussellterrier,cifj5oc,2,t5_2tlbc

6034752,0,t3_3y5bxa,Just let him chill for a bit. Is he eatingdrinking and going to the bathroom appropriately? Do you let him out in the yard on his own or always have him with you on a leash when you go out? Possible he was out running around on his own and maybe tripped or ran into something?If youre really worried and think it is a muscle a warm soak in a bath and a light rubbing massage on the apparent effected area might help.  Hope your bud feels better soon! Can we get a picture of the cute lil buddy??,jackrussellterrier,cyao66t,2,t5_2tlbc

6587013,0,t3_45uzan,Can you ask to meet the dog and talk about whether the tenants plan to crate the dog when theyre not at home? When I was apartment hunting I brought my Jack along to every apartment. I wanted my potential landlord to meet him. He is a bit older and the sweetest dog you would ever meet. The landlord of the apartment we eventually chose loved him and we never had any problems wish we could have said the same about our neighbors with their pomeranian from hell.,jackrussellterrier,d00nfwn,2,t5_2tlbc

8422790,0,t3_4ukjqr,We live in an area where it gets really cold in the winter and we got our Jack from Alabama so he wasnt used to the cold at all. We have to put a jacket on him when he goes outside or he will shake and whine. I always swore I would never put clothes on a dog but he acts like he freezing to death if he dosnt have a coat on. He will actually find one of his hoodies and carry it over to me when he is ready to go outside in the winter. Boots on the other hand...those are a totally different story. He HATES anything on his paws.,jackrussellterrier,d5ue2ok,2,t5_2tlbc
