We have no desire to own anymore nullsec space. Its a lot of work for no additional fun. Nevermind that would probably trigger the autistic hordes of the CFC to arrive shortly afterwards to stab us over and over in the heart until were dead by destroying all our space hellcamping us for a week and then leaving again.Not owning nullsec space doesnt mean we cant still have fun. We are doing so and stirring up plenty of shit in traditional TEST style.
