10709125,0,t3_5t4pzv,Im from Italy so I cannot say I fully understand your feelings and I think I am pretty lucky cause even though the whole world seems to be turning in an uncomfortable place to be yourself my family always tought me that BEING YOUR SELF IS THE BEST CHOICE YOU CAN EVER MAKE. AND TREAT EVERYBODY ELSE LIKE YOU WANT TO BE TRATEN?sorry not really good with participles correct me anytime Im wrong. So stay positive you are on the right side no one can judje and push away other people only because of some labels. In the Occident we all are now obsessed with the demonization of the muslims of the homosexuals transgender people blablabla.. But.. hey WE ARE ALL HUMANS  keep on being the special creature you are! ,grav3yardgirl,ddkkdve,1,t5_33vbg
