1910626,0,t1_ckj6prt,It actually sounds pretty in line with what Im wanting to get more involved with. Im still heavily engaged in learning so Im not sure how usefulhelpful Ill really be at this point in time.  Most of my stuff is trial and error and takes a while right now.  Id still really like to check out what youve been doing.  I dont get on here much so if its easier feel free to hit my soundcloud up or something. Thanks man.Im mostly interested in trying to make things like this  Im not quite sure how Id categorize it though.  Kind of a weird song Ive been working on.  Still a heavy WIP,edmcollab,ckjf2he,1,t5_2tps2
