4305152,0,t1_csavavc,Love this idea. To expand on that  Make the world more liveable and interactive. Make a world full of characters we can talk to and places we can go into. That was one of my favorite parts of the original.,Shenmue,csawzah,2,t5_2rqgn

4379601,0,t1_csj51gy,The answer is there right on the pagegt Yusan felt that he should focus on making each area as fully immersive as possible before moving on to the next new one so the area portions of the Stretch Goals have been grouped together.,Shenmue,csjbe5i,1,t5_2rqgn
4387893,0,t3_3b5mbu,Im actually happy with the Stretch Goals as none of them are all that important which makes me believe the really important parts are in the game.I would be mad if a stretch goal was actually like New Village Added. or something actually major. But right now the stretch goals are just fun extra things that can help the game but not make it.,Shenmue,csk938w,1,t5_2rqgn

4439149,0,t1_csq8dov,Im getting the physical PC game too even though I will buy it again physically or reluctactly digitally as needed to actually play the game on console. Im just not a PC gamer but if PC ends up being the only physical version of this game I want to have it. I also presumed the physical PC copy would be completely DRMfree. It wasnt until people started asking if it would be that I even questioned it myself.,Shenmue,csq8mme,2,t5_2rqgn

6386228,0,t3_433wec,I played this game when it first came out. Maybe around  is when I got my hands on it. This was before the Internet and before cellphones. So there were points in the game when you needed to give a passcode and actually had to write it down to remember because there was no option that just said give password. Games back then came with booklets for character profiles and game controls as well as a notes section in the back just for writing down telephone numbers or passwords or other notes. When I first played it to me it seemed on the level of Skyrim in immersion. The first game I encountered that had a full city you could explore the first game I played with a nonlinear story line and also the first that told an incredibly detailed story with amazing graphics and cutscenes for the time period that you could actually somewhat relate to based on how realistic it was. If youre coming in as a modern gamer I can completely understand your disdain for the game as modern games put it to shame it terms of graphics and ease of use for the controls. But if youre like me and your first video game experience was on a Sega Genesis where everything was a platformer or a PS with their still abysmal graphics this game was a mind blowing masterpiece with nothing else to compare it to. TLDR Youre probably too young to appreciate the magnitude this game held at the time and how ground breaking it was compared to what came before it. You cant compare it to the new generation of games only the ones before it. For reference GTA  came out the same year. ,Shenmue,czfjpig,1,t5_2rqgn
