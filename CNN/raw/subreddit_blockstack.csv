7635289,0,t3_4jpoeg,Thank you for your detailed answer. Although the multisig solution seems to be manifest as also implemented in the Bitcoin Blockchain and therefore comparably easy to implement with Blockstack it might be a little impractical in daily usage as you are always dependent on a second party for authentication which is what you would like to eliminate with Blockchain architecture. Furthermore youd need another party besides of the authentication service to ensure security in case of a lost key for example. Then if I loose my private key and the authentication service still has its private key I cant transfer the name to a new script address with only one private key remaining.The second suggestion sounds more reasonable to me but could be combined with your first suggestion to ensure maximum security and user friendliness. In my opinion only the owner key would then be allocated to a script address e.g.  out of  to ensure the ability to transfer the address if one associated key is lost because in this example both the security and user friendliness is guaranteed as for daily usage the admin key itself is sufficient. Do you have any plans yet how this could be implemented in Blockstack from a theoretical and conceptual view?,blockstack,d3a390w,1,t5_38mgx

8191381,0,t3_4r6rj3,There are two parts to that answer.First in theory there is no clear link between names youve registered from the same wallet as long as you use different owner addresses. This works exactly as Bitcoin i.e. if youre keeping bitcoins on the same owner address then they are linked. With that said in the current implementation of the CLI there is only  default owner address. So currently yes there is a link. We are looking into implementing support for a HD wallet with multiple child addresses. After that is pushed to live we will use a new unrelated child owner addresses for each new registration in the CLI. ,blockstack,d51h2us,1,t5_38mgx
