9501246,0,t1_d9k31k0,See the slabs is pretty divided on that subject. Some people are there because they have nowhere else to go and would love all the help you could give while others are more than content not owning a tent or who refuse to wear shoes.What youre proposing hasnt really been implemented before in the Slabs. I couldnt really say for sure whether I think it would be good  would work or not. If you could score grants from the state good luck getting anything from the county and things like that it very well could work and become a big thing. I know a lot of slabbers would like to have a service like that. A sort of welcome center for train kids  travel kids that just rolled in to give them toiletries and food and things like that. I definitely think that would fly.I thought what you were getting at previously was trying to help integrate these people back into normal society or something. Thats why I said it wouldnt work but now that youve elaborated a bit I think thatd be a wicked idea.I think the best bit of research you could do is a field trip. Pack up a tent or hook up the camper and stay out there for a couple weeks mingle and get to know people see what the place is really like. Head by the internet caf for some fee coffee and youll be sure to meet a good chunk of the slabbers in your first day.,SlabCity,d9k8c08,1,t5_381zg
