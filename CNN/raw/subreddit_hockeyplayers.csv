Never actually played at any of them in fact Im still in the process of getting all the equipment my own self. As far as skating goes I prefer UTC if its the middle of the week during the day time.  Its usually pretty empty in my experience then.  Only skated at Kroc once and it was so packed i could barely move around as it was.  Then a couple of times at SD Ice during the holiday skates.

208758,0,t1_cf16dep,If your sharpening has too much bite you need a shallower cut. Shake the habit early on of not being able to skate on a fresh sharpening. Find your sweet spot hollow and youll be able to stop and use your edges much better than on dulled out blades. Your glide will improve as well... which translates directly to not getting as tired as quickly.Next time you go in for a sharpening ask for a  and give it a skate. Back off to  if theres still too much bite on that. Keep going shallower by a sixteenth until you feel like youre not holding turns as tight as youd like to and youll have a better idea of what cut you should be getting.A sharp blade cut to the right hollow will give you a much more stable and efficient stop than a dull blade of the wrong hollow.

354872,0,t3_1y4g53,WELCOME!First dont be afraid of used skates. Just check to be sure theyve been well taken care of. On the toe you want to look for cracks. Scratches here are fine and normal deep cuts and cracks are a bad sign. Check the rivets that hold the boot to the chassis plastic thing that holds the blade. Make sure none are missing and that there isnt any rust. Check the chassis for deep gouges and cracks. Check the blades for cracks rust and pitting. Make sure all the eyelets that the laces go through are there and in good shape. Inside the boot you want to check the heel to make sure its not too worn and that there are no holes through the innermost fabric. Finally pull the insole our and check for rust on the inner sole of the boot.Going with used skates can allow you to get a really nice pair of skates for really cheap. You should be able to get them baked too which will help with the fit.Second throw brand loyalty out the window. It doesnt matter what your favorite player wears it matters what fits you best. Third knowing some brand tendencies might help. I worked in a pro shop from  to  and the following is based on my personal experience.... Youll want to go a size to a size and a half smaller than whatever you wear in street shoes. The goal is snug not tight.. Bauer tend to run a touch wide CCM a touch narrow.. Graf skates do not hold up and are unnecessarily expensive.. Easton skates will be really comfortable but are prone to chassisblade problems.. Mission skates will pitch you a bit forward. This isnt good or bad just know that its there. Some people love it some hate it.. Reebok and CCM are the same thing. Nike and Bauer are the same thing.Third if you spend less than  on a NEW pair of skates youre going to have a bad time.Fourth do a proper tryon. Put your foot in the boot and kick your heel back into the skate as hard as you can  or  times. This might hurt a bit. Having your heel properly seated is imperative to ensuring youre getting an accurate fitting. Lace the skates up and walk around in them. Tie them like you would to skate in snug not tight. After you walk around for a bit rock back and forth from left to right. This mimics your skating motion better than walking. The skates should feel tight and even slightly uncomfortable through the ankle and on the sides of your feel. Some discomfort is fine pain is bad. Perfect comfort is also bad it means the boot is too big.Fifth get your skates baked. Any modern pair of skates worth their salt are made with heat sensitive materials through the mids and ankles. Baking the skates softens the material allowing it to custom mold to your feet. When you do bake them tie them a little tighter than your normally would. Bring something to read youll be sitting with them on for    minutes.Take your time do your research and dont let a salesman pressure you into anything. A good skater should be able to skate gently not play a game in an untied pair of skates that are properly fitted. Good luck!,hockeyplayers,cfhjs5c,3,t5_2vs1b

But at the same time no because of connections people might have. Second Goalies in my eyes can shine at any point but the majority seems to be that its later in their career. Being a goaltender is much harder than a skater not just from a physical perspective but a mental one as well. It takes a while getting used to newer teams newer staff and most importantly newer dmen.

As always when you are really short it always seems to be your better players that miss right?  Anyways I had to play the entire game as I was the only true dman there and I have the most stamina of anyone on my team.Now to my actual game.  I played really solid D despite being pretty worn out most of the time.  Then when we were down  late in the third I brought the puck up from our end used their D as a screen and put I shot up high blocker side that went in.  The game then went to a shootout and I was the last shooter.  I was going to go forehand backhand but the guy who went before me told me that right side high was open.  So I skated in straight on pulled to my backhand and he bit and then I pulled it back to my forehand and put a little change up top shelf right side.Felt great to be rewarded for all our hard work and pull off a win despite only having  guys!,hockeyplayers,cj9zx6t,6,t5_2vs1b

I had the issue with turning in the beginning too.  But the reason is often because you arent ever really getting to the glide youre just on your edge the whole time.  You dont turn into a stop and then start sliding.  When you do a real hockey stop you unload your weight turn your hips then sink into it as youre shaving the ice.  That unloading is what is going to allow you to turn your body without spinning around because your inside edge is carving out a circle.  Like everyone else said do more onefoot shaving and turning into it.  But keep in mind that at speed youre gonna have to do it quickly.  And in doing it quickly you will need to unweight the feet as your turn your hips perpendicular to the direction of travel.,hockeyplayers,comhh9d,1,t5_2vs1b

EVERYBODY has to start somewhere and that somewhere is NOWHERE near the level of play for something that has been doing so for    or  years.  Of course the tournament or league should have better matched the teams but thats not always possible.  Maybe this one bad team was horrendously good in the lower league and they had the same issues as the other teams in the new league have with them.If it really is that big of a deal for anybody perhaps the better teams could have a discussion with the league or tournament managers about making the matching more even.  ,hockeyplayers,con7zh7,1,t5_2vs1b

It is used as a way to tell someone you dont like what they did. Some players wont get the message just by pushing them around or chirping them. You have to use force. The  of concussions that come from fighting is very little. Often times after fights the players tap each other and the back or say good fight. Its not out of anger. Fighters step in for others that arent willing to. This is just a short piece about what i think about it. Feel free is quote it or whatever. You can say my name is Sean Avery lol.

3274988,0,t1_cp1ciy3,I was honest with the pro shop at Icehouse that I was thinking of buying my skates elsewhere but I wanted to get fitted but I still felt bad for doing it. It was such a big difference in price though that I couldnt justify it at the time. The thing to consider though is that if you do buy them at Icehouse Bladeworx Next Level etc... in Melbourne that theyll general throw in the bake and the first sharpen for free which can add up and cut out a lot of the benefit you get from buying online. The last time I checked Bladeworx actually had some pretty good deals on decent midrange skates like the Bauer Vapor X which I use. I wouldnt buy anything else from them though their protective gear and sticks are way overpriced.Icemonster is where I got a lot of my beginner gear and they were fine.

As an individual you cant do much Id say but if you get multiple teams to complain then I feel like they wouldshould do something. Id be mad if I was you.

3587715,0,t3_31fdh7,Hooks are pretty common when it comes to defensive plays as a last ditch effort. Shouldnt feel bad because you didnt do anything wrong its just part of the rules. Its like buying an apple or something. You exchange money for a good. You exchange penalty minutes for a hook. Just makes sure youre getting good value.That said obviously you shouldnt encourage dangerous penalties like high sticking or tripping or especially something like boarding but a hooking penalty is pretty minor in my experience at least. I used to play soccer as a kid and to me a hooking penalty on a defensive play is like giving up a corner. Dont want to do it but sometimes its the right play.,hockeyplayers,cq1873g,1,t5_2vs1b

How well I can stop is very dependent on the skating surface and what hardness of wheel I pick. So anyway Id say to make sure you work on your stops.,hockeyplayers,cqb93nr,2,t5_2vs1b

3752259,0,t1_cqjxzuw,A heel curve bends at the heel and mid bends in the middle. Heel curves have more of an upwards shape to them. You can get much more lift close in but farther away it may be harder to be accurate. The depth has more to do with speed and accuracy. The deeper curves allow for a bit more spin on the puck. More spin  more speed.  With the Kane curve you can cup the puck really well allowing for more controlled stick handling. If you prefer less curve you may like the Stamkos. It is a fairly gentle curve. Does that answer your question? ,hockeyplayers,cqjzfos,1,t5_2vs1b

3819261,0,t1_cqobfyn,IMHO the whole draw to roller is that it is a  on  constant motion game.  It isnt ice hockey on wheels it is a completely different take on hockey.  By adding offside you are forcing more turnovers and giving players less time with the puck.  Almost everyone I know who plays roller says its because how much puck time you get and I couldnt agree more.All that being said Ive never played roller on a rink even the same size as an ice rink.  The rinks Ive played on if someone cleared the puck the length of the rink it was no big deal.  Your defense is usually playing the mid line and it only takes  or so strides to get to the back boards.,hockeyplayers,cqrmkle,1,t5_2vs1b

If this flick is later it means the puck is on the blade a little longer and vice versa.Your swing of the stick is not in a straight line but in an arc as is a swing in baseball. In baseball you can change the direction the ball is hit by being early or late on your swing. With hockey you can change the lift in a shot by being early or late your puck leaves your stick. Being early makes a low shot being late keeping the puck on the stick longer makes a higher shot.At least thats how I understood it.,hockeyplayers,cquqezy,1,t5_2vs1b

5055641,0,t3_3k6gvc,Captain sets the tone of the team. Hopefully with input from the team.Every team will have a range of competitive players and less competitive players that just want to have fun. The team must find a balance but it usually falls to the captain to let people know when they are out of line either too competitive or too slack. Ideally you should try to let the team decide what type of team they want to be.ExamplesDoes everyone get equal ice time or do you have a power line that plays more? usually beer league everyone plays equally.Late in the game when you are down or up by a goal do you shorten the bench?Does everyone play the power play and PK equally not always equal at rec levelWho takes a shootout?Does the captain choose lines or not. If not what happens when you have  people that want to play forward and only  defence?If two players are not getting along you have to get involved for the sake of the team and get them to keep their issues off the ice and out of the room.Once you get the team to help figure out what type of team you want to be the captain should lead by example. So if you want to be a tough team and someone takes a run at one of your players you paste him to the boards OR if you want to be seen as a clean playing team set the tone by skating away and dont engage the assholes on the other team.

5211386,0,t1_cvdwt8g,Ive been playing for many years and Im not one to destroy bags often. Ive probably gone through  bags in  years. Most of my issues have been holes developing on the bottom my bag just from throwing it around. Not really abusing it but just wear and tear. Replaced my bag last year with the Warrior Pro and its really nice. Probably the nicest bag Ive had so far. I really like the quality of it. I dont really care about the skate pockets but theyre nice to have. I like the accessory pockets and I do like that all of the pockets are internal so that they dont get caught on anything. The vents are also a huge plus although not needed for me since i take my pads out to dry after every game. But there have been times where I had to go somewhere after my game and that vent came in handy.Its pricey but the quality is great. That style of bag has been around for a long time. Warrior just added a couple of things that the other pro style bags didnt have. No matter the brand you go with most pro bags will end up costing around the same price. Should the OP decide to go with a pro bag just look at the type of material also the thickness of it pocket layouts and price. Then see what extras you care fordont care for. I would add another vote for the Warrior bag. A would buy again.,hockeyplayers,cve5xst,2,t5_2vs1b

The formula is kind of Luck  possession time  goals if that makes any sense at all. So focus on positioning and back checking mostly because thats something you really can control and let the rest of the game come to you.After I have a good game I usually get caught trying to force offense or make moves I shouldnt in places where its not worth it. So dont be a boneheaded bender like me and focus on defense. You can control defense. ,hockeyplayers,cw057ow,1,t5_2vs1b

5529601,0,t3_3qt82t,Im team captain and rep for my team and one of our players just got indefinitely suspended from the league for basically a constant string of events that lead him to get kicked out of almost all our games.Let me start by saying that we do not dislike you as a person. The guy we lost was overall enjoyable to talk to and be around. But on the flip side we are happy to have him off the ice. We dont like playing short handed for  minutes every game and then having to fight over who is going to sit in the box for his stupid penalty because he got kicked out. We all paid to come play hockey not penalty kill and sit for him in the box.So dont be depressed because no one dislikes you we just dont like your actions on the ice because they impact us negatively and arent fun.What you can do to help with your anger is to stop attributing everything that happens to you as malice. Ive been absolutely leveled in a nohitting game and rather than flipping out on the guy as soon as I got up I simply thought We must have run into each other or something. Sure enough after the whistle the guy came over and started apologizing profusely telling me it was an accident. I wasnt hurt so I just said no problem and we kept playing.This guy on the other hand would immediately think This is a no hitting league who the F does this guy think he is immediately chase him down and start an altercation which ends up into a grapplingshoving match and proceed to get penalties or get kicked out.See the difference? You just need to make a mental effort to think that some things are truly accidents without any malicious intent.,hockeyplayers,cwigejk,5,t5_2vs1b

I will likely try the cage hybrid next though because I find that the plastic in the cage portion is much wider than the metal which makes it easier for me to lose the puck in my skates.as for fogging all the shields these days are fine with a little extra care. you can buy antifog solutions but i just use basic dish soap wiped on and then removed with a lint free cloth. i know some people have complained about fogging but look around the NHL everyone is using a visor even if its without lower cage protection without significant issue. i do however bring a towel to the bench with me to wipe the visor because you inevitably may get a little fog a little water overspray when taking a drink or just some ice if you get hit with a high stick or something that can mess up your vision a bit. totally manageable though i wont be going back to a full cage.,hockeyplayers,cxu5vgq,4,t5_2vs1b

6062567,0,t3_3yhjvj,Its hard to police a C division when you need this players for the teams to have enough players. One thing we do is called the Mentor rule. If a guy is too good which we can usually tell by his stats or by ref writeups is tell him he can play but he isnt allowed to score. If he does score the puck goes to centre ice but the goal doesnt count. We also have the fair player initiative. It requires the buyin by all the officials  something we struggle with because its really subjective. If a ref deems a player is playing outside of his skill level or the spirit of the division the ref can give said player a Fair Player Warning FPW. Once the player is warned any time the ref thinks he is playing outside of the skill of the div he can assess a  minute minor penalty. The FPW is notated on the game sheet and follows the player around all season as indicated on the printed game sheet. This works because our league has game and season penalty minute caps. The cons to this is that its subjective. One ref might think Bill is a stud and everything he does is unfair. Another ref might see him walk through everyone score and think it isnt that big of a deal. Policing the lower levels of hockey is the hardest thing to do. We have beginner programs that constantly feed new players and we dont want to tell them they cant play with more experienced friends. Hell the friends likely got them into the game.  ,hockeyplayers,cyeanw3,3,t5_2vs1b

We did pain management with a lot of drugs some lower back injections and some phys therapy.  In the end I swear by yoga which I took up after it happened.

6702527,0,t3_47fojd,Football is an entirely different sport. I wont even address that.In basketball there is no goalie and a defender cant stop a shot once it is out of the shooters hands. The overall goal of defense is to  contest the shot. Man defense if your defenders are capable can contest quite a few shots. However at any competitive level of the game the base defense is almost universally a  or  zone depending on personnel and opponent.In hockey there are limited scoring angles due to the net and the goalie. In this set up a zonal scheme can eliminate many angles and shut down passing lanes needed to move the goalie laterally.man mad defense isnt played because it is way too easy to get a defense inside out and the defense gets why too chaotic when  guys are chasing each other across the ice.HOWEVER man defense is not entirely uncommon in v marking situations. Famously Don Cherry had assigned I think it was Rick Middleton to mandefend  Guy Lapointe which was working very well until confusion from constant line changes and Lapointe getting tripleshifted caused the too many men call of legend.,hockeyplayers,d0cll0i,3,t5_2vs1b

7049688,0,t1_d1fb2ab,Napoleon ComplexIm a short guy  and youre right. Guys seem to think they can push me around and nothing will happen so I usually nip that in the bud with a good chirp or a hard shoulder. Most people dont give a shit how big everyone on the ice is but some guys feel like its an affront to their manhood when a small guy is faster or better than they are. So they shove me around.A guy last Sunday got his stick up between my hands and shoved me down I was not ready for that little move pretty good one honestly. Whatever. He then tried to chirp me on his way to the bench and I had to ask him a couple times what he said you need to put on some weight! I just laughed at him and said buddy youre skinnier than I am! What are you  ? Next shift he goes out and gets knocked on his ass and God bless my teammates because our whole bench yells something like hey ! put on some weight bud!So you might say I have a Napoleon complex but in my case its a survival tactic not an insecurity.

Other options are to regroup the puck back to the d if there isnt still too much pressure back there and try for a better situation on the breakout and slow the flow down a bit. Or position yourself to gain the red line and chip it in deep. If you find yourself in this situation frequently the d is going to continue to step up. Use that opportunity to create an odd man situation. Like I said have your other winger or center support you to chip it up and beat the d then the other guy joins the rush with whoever you just chipped it to.

7683824,0,t3_4khk5u,I tell players to use golf balls because theyre squirrely and light.  They move quick and get away easily so they make you aware of random hops and rolling.  Theyre also puckheight so you dont get into bad habits like you do with bigger balls.  Big balls make your stick handling more choppy because you have to lift your stick too high.Ball Hockey balls the big orange ones are the worst.  Theyre too light too big too sticky and just all around bad except they dont hurt TOO bad when you get hit with one.The smaller weighted balls are alright as theyre closer to puck weight and height but they arent as squirrely as a puck on fresh ice so it feels slow to me.When using a ball its best to use a bare stick no tape.  The tape sticks to the balls and makes the stick like to hop over them and thats not how a puck behaves.With that in mind real fake pucks like a green biscuit are great for stick handling.I dont recommend shooting with anything other than a real puck however.  Shooting with a biscuit or any kind of ball will get you terrible habits so get a shooting pad and some pucks for actual shooting.Also throw away the oz pucks usually blue ones.  Unless youre under  pounds yourself theyll just give you bad habits.  Theyre intended for  year olds who arent strong enough to get a normal puck up onto their stick.,hockeyplayers,d3flqmx,1,t5_2vs1b

7782968,0,t1_d3qt7xf,Stick handling off one foot is actually a great exercise as it can help the balance and body dynamics but it could still be hurtful even if his leg is up and off the ground as its natural to try to balance with a free limb potentially twisting it.   The same goes for passing.  Shooting is probably out of the question for a RH shooter with a right ACL injury although he could gingerly try some leftfoot shooting.  But again the torque on the body alone might cause some twisting in the elevated leg.Rather than wrist shots he could look at working on his chipflip shot which is a less twisting motion more of the motion of shoveling show.Workouts such as seated trunk rotations and various other upper body workouts can be great.

There are definitely some very new skaters there but there are also some guys who have done the clinic year after year.  The coaches at the clinic are very knowledgeable and helpful and can tailor their personal instruction to your needs.  The clinic does an organized scrimmage for the last hour or so and it is broken up into lines stratified by skill to keep everyone involved.The USM shop has a Facebook page called Buxton Blade Precision Sharpening or something.

If I were you I may go look at some prostock sticks and see if you can find any there that are in your price range and in the lower flex you are looking for. I think you would be surprised what you may find. The other way to go is to go on somewhere like hockey monkey ice wear house or your favorite hockey retailer and get a cheap mystery pack and go from there. That way you get two sticks and you have no predetermined biases. ,hockeyplayers,d41st3v,1,t5_2vs1b

8800298,0,t3_50oepp,I made a roller hockey team when I was .  It was the first time I had ever played hockey although I did grow up playing football and rollerblading around bit for transportation the s were awful.With that said half of my roster  dudes to be exact had never been on blades before or played any organized sport outside of high school gym class.  Some people didnt take to it and others really did.  Out of those  dudes I know that  are still playing hockey.   of them helped me find more skaters to switch to ice and fill out a  man roster.  On that roster was a woman who decided she wanted to pick up hockey in her s.  So at  she became our goalie.I also at  decided to put together a coed flag football team.  On that roster I was the only one who had ever considered throwing or catching a football outside of my quarterback also one of the  dudes mentioned in example .  Also on that roster was my wife who runs like a gazelle trying to avoid anthills and admittedly wont try and catch a ball if its thrown to hard.  We had a blast.The point of all of this is just do it.  Get on skates and fall.  Once you feel like you can stay upright and control your speed a bit go to a stick and puck.  Youll need skates a helmet a stick and gloves.  Then get out there and swing at a puck and fall.  Once you feel like you can skate with a puck on your stick and not fall go take a lesson.  If you dont want to take a lesson then just keep going to stick and pucks and maybe go watch a game in the beginner leagues.  Pick out the worst player you can find and as soon as you think Im almost as good as that guy buy a full set of cheap gear and sign up.  You also have drop ins that you can attend.  These are great for getting a feel for game speed prior to signing up but can also be filled with some high end skaters who might intimidate you.,hockeyplayers,d75ocm4,7,t5_2vs1b

9298062,0,t3_57ruh1,Profile. Profile. Profile. Profile. Out of the box ALL skates blades are the same. All people are not the same. We skate different and are anatomically different. When I was young we profiled blades and didnt even know it was called profiling. We just ground down the toe to give more of an attack angle and flattened out the front for more ice contact. Now they have this down to a science. People can ask you weight height skating ability position strengths weaknesses and take all of the data and make a recommendation on what profile you should go with.Some refer to this as profiling combination radius triple combination radius and quad combination radius. I have used traditional and the combination radius. I have not used the other two and cannot comment on them. In fact I dont really understand how you can have a triple or quad radius but thats probably because I havent seen it in person. Long story short. ProfileRadius first. Skate  times with it. See how you like it. Then adjust if needed. Its a slow process to find the right profileradius and skate sharpening depth. Do NOT make too many changes at once. One change at a time. SO don get a combination radius and change to an FBV while changing your insoles and adding a rear riser. That will certainly spell disaster.,hockeyplayers,d8ulgue,3,t5_2vs1b

When I got older and was looking for a player to model myself after one of the first professional hockey players I met in person was Jeremy Roenick. He left a huge impression on me and during summer training camp I asked my coaches to help mold my style of play to be like his. I loved the fact he was a USA hockey player and he attended Thayer a school I both admired and considered before selecting Shattuck. I relished his gritty style of play and character. Unlike many other players I always felt he truly loved the sport and put everything he had into every game regardless of the outcome. I also appreciated his direct way of putting things a very this is how it is take it or leave it type of character. If you havent already read it check out his book Shoot First Pass Later.

10152069,0,t3_5lbh80,I started playing hockey about  years ago. One of the things that I have found is that going to stick and pucks has helped me progress more than drop ins and mens league play. The key however is focused practicing. When I started going to stick and pucks I just did what it seemed like everyone else was doing. I would just noodle around and throw shots on the goalie. My biggest advancements would be when I would pick a specific skill that I was bad at and practicing on that for lengths of time. If I would get tiredsore move on to the next drill.

But the numbers are skewed because of the female bias in figure skating. Not hockey. For your local rink to just pluck this number out of the air in context to devoting  of SnP time to women isnt fair.If I was in your local area Id contact the rink myself and get some of my female friends to say that they had no qualms about sharing the ice. It depends how much effort you want to put into this but could it be worth getting some female friendsacquaintances to do this for you? Or possibly make an open Facebook or similar group to find out interest in making these coedadult instead of exclusively female?

10527829,0,t1_dd0tpbl,Well I can tell you what I use. Im about  standing in bare feet. I use a regular  inch stick cut down about ..  flex. I use whats equivalent to the Drury heel curve with a . lie. The stick comes up to my eyebrows while standing in bare feet. I think my stick length is long for my height but Im used to it as a defenceman. When I shoot my tape wears right in the middle of my blade. It works perfectly for the pattern I use. As for what youre saying your stick could very well be the right length but it might be the wrong pattern for you. If you seem to be shooting off the toe of your blade you might benefit from something like the Kane curve that Bauer has. You could just try to trim your stick down a bit as it might be too long. Can always get a plug extender if you cut it too short in the end. But you kind of have to experiment with things as you go until you find out what works. After that I marked my stick length on a wall and always cut my new sticks to that exact same length.  ,hockeyplayers,dd1fzrc,1,t5_2vs1b

Skate a couple times a week on both ice and wheels and in a month you may not even consciously think about the difference.

10920324,0,t3_5vy8pg,Most of the issues you described difficulty crossing over difficulty puck handling difficulty skating with the puck back pain are often due to bending at the waist instead of the knees and ankles.When youre standing straight up doing anything with the puck while skating is quite difficult.  Work on that hockey stance.  You can do it off ice.  Get your feet wider wider than shoulder width and do some squats.   The good kind like youre weight lifting.  Look at yourself in the mirror if you can and make sure you can see the logo on the front of your shirt clearly the whole time.Stop about  of the way into your squat.  Thats a skating position.  Now grab the stick out in front of you and youre good.Another thing beginners often do is having their top hand pinned to their hip. This also makes it super hard to do the things you describe stick handling while skating shooting etc.  Ironically doing this makes backhands feel easier but limits your range and reach.Get your top hand away from your body.  Work on stick handling passing and shooting with your top hand a full arms length in front of you for a bit and then again with your top elbow flying up high and your top hand just out from your armpit this is a position for handling the puck in your feet.  Obviously theres lots more but thats a place to start.,hockeyplayers,de6cs5v,5,t5_2vs1b

11094077,0,t1_dep4c55,Hey thats me! Thanks for checking out the videos.I can provide some insight to you guys. Im in a somewhat unique situation and have had to make some changes to how I film along the way. My GoPro Hockey videos started with just a regular helmet mount and a Hero  Black. Heres an example GoPro Hero  Black  Regular Helmet Mount GameplayUnfortunately our roller rink was torn down so I started making videos on the ice. During my first session the ref came up and told me that I wasnt allowed to wear a GoPro during league games. So the guys over at UHWK sent me a camera. Ill be  honest with you guys the UHWK is...decent. Personally I dont think the lens has a wide enough angle for a sport like hockey where a lot of the action is on the stickpuck. I made one video and decided that wouldnt be the best solution for my channel. That video is here UHWK GameplayFor my final solution I had to improvise a little bit. I cut out a small hole in the front of my helmet and a larger rectangle in the foam padding allowing me to hide my GoPro during games. Heres a good look at it Hidden GoPro HelmetFor my videos I currently use a GoPro Hero  Black with the Superview setting which gives you a good look at both the play and stickhandling. Im guessing its tough to find one since its an older model but I got mine for under . Overall Id recommend buying an older model GoPro Black at a discount avoiding the UHWK and using a regular helmet mount if your leaguerink allows it. Best of luck!

11394608,0,t3_62jpnr,One on one situations I always like to go to the side opposite hes holding the stick in. Making him reach across his body gives him less reach can throw him off balance and opens him up a bit more. If he has a slow pivot you can just beat him wide. If he turns and has the angle on you good chance there will be some space between his legs to slide the puck between and cut back. It all depends on the situation though. Its a lot of reading and reacting out there. The more you play and the more situations you can experience the better youll become.,hockeyplayers,dfnka55,2,t5_2vs1b

If hanging hooks in the ceiling arent an option I suggest using your current idea and simply adding some hooks straight out from the front of the xs and hanging it there.  It should give you another  inches of space plus you can always screw the hooks in further or pull them further out and adjust accordingly based on how much room behind the tarp you need.

11504609,0,t3_63wsaf,Hmm.. A lot of people are kind of making this out to be like it doesnt matter but I just want to confirm that your original observation was absolutely  correct. Maybe not at the lower levels but when you start facing high level goalies if youre not snapping the puck in from close and getting the maximum amount of power possible on every single shot youre sabotaging yourself.         Check this picture out.     Notice how close the puck is to his right foot which is what he is putting all his weight on. Additionally its important to notice where his hands are but more specifically WHAT his hands and arms are doing. His left arm is extended far in front of him and a just a little bit out and to the left of his body. The action of this arm during the shot will be to pull back that arm as quickly as possible in tight to his body this quickness of the left arm coming back in to the body is responsible for the SNAP part of the shot.       The right hand is placed a little less than halfway down the stick this placement tends to vary from player to player and their specific style but it typically ends up right around there.   The action of the right ARM is to apply a lot of pressure downwards on the ice. Now remember to look at the placement of the puck. Notice how his hands at this point in the shot are actually in FRONT of the puck. This is the result of proper form AND why your original observation was  correct.     This downward pressure in conjunction with the placement of the puck and the fact that his left arm is in front of his body and also the fact that he is putting all his weight on the foot nearest to the puck results in a massive flexing of the stick.     So now when he pulls his left arm back towards his body the stick will unflex around the same time and it will really slingshot the puck. If that puck was further away from his body he wouldnt be able to apply as much downward force because obviously its hard to apply more force further away from your body.   A FANTASTIC shot is the result of a lot of little small things being executed correctly. Also good observation. ,hockeyplayers,dg01qi5,2,t5_2vs1b

11633841,0,t3_6604zc,It sounds like a muscle strain.You should do some stretches before the game on your neck specifically.  Do some head rolls and try to touch your ears to your shoulders chin to chest chin to sky etc.  All the edges of your movement to get the muscles loose.If you have ongoing pain you might need to take a break and let the muscles heal and then start a stretching routine.Your body will adjust.,hockeyplayers,dgepii9,1,t5_2vs1b

11739689,0,t3_67d1ox,Skating drills for relative beginners are all about breaking down the motions.  Work on wide ccuts onefoot edges crossovers focusing on good pushes on both feet transitions facing the same end while doing circles maybe.  Use the circles as much as you can to help with the feeling of turning all the time.Start to add pucks to the same skating drills.  Try passing to them on the circles.I dont like static practice like standing still and shooting or passing except for a minute or two before starting to do the same motion while moving.  Toss in a tight turn or a pass before shooting drills and keep their feet moving.,hockeyplayers,dgqq28x,5,t5_2vs1b

11765458,0,t3_67v9cf,Im mainly right handed but prefer a left stick so I can dangle better only difference is I hit harder slap shots with a right handed stick.Also depends how you dangle I use my top hand but Ive seen newer players use their bottom hand which I find moves the stick too slow. ,hockeyplayers,dgtn7yj,1,t5_2vs1b

11769173,0,t1_dgtyff0,So if you want MXs and want to spend that I would. They are great gloves. But I am going to list you a bunch of gloves that would probably work for you as well and are in that price range.Easton HSX .Easton CX . I think the HSX are nicerBauer MX . I link Icewarehouse since they have custom colour ways and price match.CCM Ultra Tacks .CCM Tacks  Kevlar Palm . Price match with Monkey since they are  cheaper thereCCM Tacks  . Better palm than above in terms of comfort.CCM K . One of the most underrated and ignored gloves ever but also one of my favouritesI didnt have good experiences with my Verbero gloves but I had the original ones and their newer ones seem better so I cant comment on those.,hockeyplayers,dgu2eud,3,t5_2vs1b
