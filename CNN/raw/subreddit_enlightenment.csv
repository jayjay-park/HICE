2708183,0,t1_cn6pkmm,this is such a terrible way to cheapen Enlightenment. Thats why its better to stick with the traditions and compare what any newguyonthe block says about it. Its so much more than metaokayness. There is Unityconsciousness transcendence peace bliss accessing and abiding permanently in the source of thought locatingpenetratingspring cleaning the entire subconscious stream resting in the absolute beingness which is unbornunmanifest.Seriously dont listen to this guy. Hes had a few other people refute him people who he went to personally asking for help with his path and then denies he did that and masquerades as enlightened. ,enlightenment,cnbwrpc,2,t5_2qr80
4197447,0,t3_37ki0k,In my case I had been casually studying Buddhism for years but then after a severe case of alcohol poisoning and  months of crippling anxiety that all revolved around fear of dying I felt compelled to completely absorb into spirituality and find enlightenment. Within this time it all happened pretty quickly. I read Nisargadatta Maharajs I Am That cover to cover and watched satsangs with Sri Mooji daily. After  months of this I began to wind down stop searching stop engaging and identifying with thoughts slowly realising as opposed to one great fingerclick moment. Then after a week or so of feeling true peace and bliss I wanted nothing the notion of enlightenment didnt even occur to me anymore. I stopped looking. Then one simple afternoon as I was taking a break from work drinking a coffee whilst gazing out of the window at the trees and the clouds the universal truth unfolded before my eyes. Everything just softly fell into place and I cried and I laughed and laughed and laughed. ,enlightenment,crypdv7,2,t5_2qr80

6378335,0,t1_czemt1o,Everything is a theory until YOU see it yourself. I can not show you. Ive seen this myself directly.This is how spirituality works its beyond duality beyond the physical world and absolutely beyond evidence. Evidence is part of duality. All things spiritual are pointers and nothing in and of themselves. I can stick a sign post in front of you for you to look for yourself where its pointing but I cant do the looking for you.You are also absolutely right to doubt everything why wouldnt you?Are you here for awakening?,enlightenment,czenbsm,1,t5_2qr80

9727847,0,t3_5e9ul5,It could be synchronicity. You are becoming more in tune with your true nature as the whole becomes harmonized with the self. It will wax and wane as you grow. I would recommend not reading too much into it as it can get one into some paranoid and scary borderline psychotic mindsets. Appreciate that you have made the realization that your thoughts and intentions have influence on your reality and get back to chopping wood and drinking water ,enlightenment,dac64xv,1,t5_2qr80
