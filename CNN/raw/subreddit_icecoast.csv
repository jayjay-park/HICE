6373009,0,t3_42w517,Jay peak is my favorite mountain on the east coast. Generally gets a decent amount of snow sometimes more than other mtns  and has the best glades Ive skied ,icecoast,cze1hgk,2,t5_340f4
9131158,0,t3_55any9,White Mountain superpass is probably your best bet. Waterville Cannon Bretton Woods and Cranmore are on the pass.,icecoast,d89fuk2,2,t5_340f4
9474587,0,t3_5ae4re,Stowe pretty much anywhere between two trails and on either side of the mountain has lines.  For your intro to glades Jay is tough to beat.    ,icecoast,d9gy43u,1,t5_340f4

9879088,0,t3_5guv6s,I skied Stowe both days last weekend it was amazing.  There was a lot of rope ducking going on.  I dont think I hit a single rock.  That said I am not going to take out my new race skis but my all mountains had no problem.  There are some snow storms that Jay gets that the rest of Vermont doesnt.   Those tend to hit Buffalo...  There are storms that hit southern VT that miss us up here those are the ones that pound NYC.   We havent had either of those so far this year.  I am a Stowe homer so to me it is always worth the extra drive.  I think Stowe is a much nicer town.   I think StoweSugarbush areas attracts people from NYC that know how to ski.  They see the value in that extra  minutes.  Plus Stowe is like the in the heart of the VT beer scene.    Killington is a fine mountain.,icecoast,dav9oaq,4,t5_340f4

10307922,0,t1_dccfkcp,Ah gotchya thanks for the clarification. Well the forecast looks much better now lol. Im heading up to conway tonight It looks like the temps are gonna lower back down to the s and s this weekend. So hopefully the snow turns into some nice hardpack corduroy,icecoast,dccginm,1,t5_340f4
10411240,0,t3_5kqnuw,Went to Bolton Valley last night Jan .   Have to say I was pleasantly surprised by the snow.  The only place the icy base was visible was on the race course.  Other than that my skis only touch soft edgeable fluffy snow. There were no lines at all.Afterwards I drank Fiddlehead IPA.I was around a lot of weird people last night!  ,icecoast,dco6jtk,3,t5_340f4
10552221,0,t1_dd46zmb,Second Cardigan. Its probably the closest youll get with any sort of decent coverage. Couple good CCC trails and no real threat of getting lost of having to bushwack.,icecoast,dd47ob1,2,t5_340f4
10592945,0,t3_5rn3en,I went to UVM  back in the early s you could buy a season pass to Stowe and Sugarbush Big Pass for .  We used to ski from Oct to  April,icecoast,dd8kwma,3,t5_340f4

10899881,0,t3_5vrhhf,Depends on where you are. Im not confident about the western NY resorts holding on much longer looking at the  day weather forecast. We will still get storms March storms are usually big so well see what happens there. The more northern areas and places that have been able to hold onto their snow should be OK for a bit. ,icecoast,de48ubk,2,t5_340f4

11006075,0,t3_5x1dlz,Odds are you will find there what we have here in Northern VT.  Groomers will be fine.  Anything not groomed with be rock hard.  Those resorts got a lot more snow this winter than we did.  So there will be plenty of cover.    Just get your skis sharpened.  ,icecoast,defiaao,2,t5_340f4
11109627,0,t1_der96te,Well this is a first time to hunter for me I mostly stick to windham since its less crowded than hunter and better trailslayout than belleayer. What type of riding do you normally do?,icecoast,der9luo,1,t5_340f4
