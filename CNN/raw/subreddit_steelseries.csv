2930795,0,t3_2tobdj,I use the H Wireless exclusively with my XBox One and I have not noticed a buzz.  I would try both a new controller and a new Headset adapter if possible.  Another good way to test your audio is to do a Skype test call on the X Then youll be able to hear what the mic sounds like.If you need to get a new adapter take a look at the new Turtle Beach adaptersI was upset with how low the Mic Monitoring was with the H Wireless on the X.

8503072,0,t1_d64dgon,hiho thanks for youre respond Well it does this issue on skype and teamspeak... another problem is that my friends in skype hear what i listen... for example i listen to music in youtube and they can hear it i have to turn down the volume extremly and even then they still hear it a little bit.... any solutions for that ? or is that just because the headset is built open? sorry for my bad english D,steelseries,d64frlz,1,t5_2stg0
8559501,0,t1_d6arp3s, yes i did...   Can the extension cord lower the mic volume like    making it useless for communication...?,steelseries,d6bij8u,1,t5_2stg0

8763083,0,t3_502hft,I had the same issue after firmeware updates of my Rival  and Sensei Wireless as well. Mouse was blinking firmeware update mode and was not recognized by SS Engine . After I unplugged the mouse a few times the mouse was finally recognized in the software again together with a warning that a critical firmware update is needed. After doing the firmware update a second time all went fine. As I said this strange behavior was exactly the same on both mice. ,steelseries,d711oyb,1,t5_2stg0
8867027,0,t1_d7dm7nu,Mine doesnt rumble? Weird I wouldnt want it to anyways that would fuck up my aiming or maybe it wouldnt I dont know. Im pretty sure that the game sense has more games than three though. I could be wrong.,steelseries,d7doxlj,1,t5_2stg0
8935996,0,t3_52ogss,SSE isnt picking up the headset because its an analog connection  SSE is only for configuring USB products.  Silly question but youre sure you didnt connect the coupler backwards?,steelseries,d7lz3jz,1,t5_2stg0
9161554,0,t1_d8d9zcm,maybe its an issue with power or spaceconsumption of the RGB module which would hurt the performance of a wireless headset.The thing I worry about most is the internal battery and how it will degrade over time. The hotswappable battery of the Siberia  was the deciding factor for me after owning a Logitech wireless gaming headset.,steelseries,d8dalqi,2,t5_2stg0
9354247,0,t3_58cjs9,Can you guys confirm which SSE you are on and which firmware your mice are on for both r and r? Also which OS  or  bit and is it completely up to date with Windows Updates? I need info to get to the team so we can investigate. The more the merrier.,steelseries,d91pulg,1,t5_2stg0
9511493,0,t1_d9jxkw9,Hey no fair I have a written proof from steelseries support that I can use it to buy the arctis  that I can use my rival  rma coupons i confirmed it  times. You people need to get your act together. ,steelseries,d9lhrz3,1,t5_2stg0
9545981,0,t1_d92k5st,Hey man! I dont have a Rival  so sorry if this doesnt answer your question properly. But since it sounds like youre just asking for the RGB code itll be   .The M only has blue LEDs so its just  blue  everything else.

9565876,0,t3_5bxoc0,I have the H now the Siberia  so I know not the same thing but might be similar construction. For mine they are OK with glasses for a while but they give me a headache if I do it for too long. The way I fixed this was I got a pair of Gunnars which are designed to be worn with headphones and that feels great even for long periods. ,steelseries,d9s6uld,1,t5_2stg0

10320417,0,t3_5nqoky,Need an answer to this.My QCk XXL from last year has started fraying.SS support is so slow to respond.Planning to replace it with a Qck Mass want to know for sure if the fraying issues been fixed.,steelseries,dcdvjl5,1,t5_2stg0
10341966,0,t3_5kl7d6,Old thread but I can attest to having the same issue. Oddly enough it only started happening a few days ago for me. It started with the sound quality randomly dipping out and sounding like everything was being played through a funnel or underwater and now it just cuts out entirely requiring me to unplug the headset and plug it back in.Have also been coping with the Sensei mouse never detecting on system startup requiring me to gasp! unplug the mouse and plug it back in.Needless to say Im absolutely livid with SteelSeries right now.,steelseries,dcgbk1x,1,t5_2stg0

10678798,0,t3_5sgz7f,Related to the other threads about this mouse. I dont think it has anything to do with the other hardware. Its a pretty common problem and is more kind of a manifactory  software malfunction. If you scroll down in this subreddit there are few rival  disconnect threads but noone offers an working solution.,steelseries,ddhfqxu,1,t5_2stg0

10894558,0,t3_56lg7c,I just posted a video about the Rival s issues and the features I still love about it. Its hard to keep faith in the mouse and the company after this crap but hanging in there...
