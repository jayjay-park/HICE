Rambo Go in guns blazing and focussing on slinging as much damage as possible to take out as many enemies as possible.. Die Hard slowly pick off enemies as much as possible while sticking to cover and safe zones. Then take down the boss after the mobs are clear..

10986091,0,t3_5wp4nj,If you do a stealth attack from tall grass enemies dont see you when youre in the attack animation. So if a machine is looking right at you when you kill its kin it wont notice you as long as youre crouching and you get right back into the grass. There have been tons of situations where I have  machines walking up to my patch of grass and I nonchalantly turn them into a body pile within  seconds. You can stealthkill battalions of people with a small patch of grass and rockswhistleAlso easiest way to kill basically everything thats horsesized or smaller is R R. Knockdown crit done. Usually Id be chaining melee attacks up in strength a la light before heavy to open them up then come down hard usually a standard tactic in fighting games but this seems to work a lot better because that knockdown has a looooooong stun time. You can knockdown  enemies at the same time and then run around and stab them all before any of them get back up.,horizon,ded8lj7,3,t5_2s5h5

Second Historically theres a decent record of more aggressive groups tending to focus on some form of ethnic purity which would explain the homogeneity we see.So put simply when you say that the only white men in the game are evil youre just plain wrong and there are believable reasons why the villains would be fairly homogeneous.

10996482,0,t3_5wy2kt,I look at it this way. Female game characters are made by mostly male developers to please mostly male audiences. How that is meant to happen can vary. They can write a great story and have a top VA voice her. They can put her in a ridiculously sexy outfit the better to have a nice butt on the screen at all times. They can make her appearance customizable. They can make her a role model for kids. They can make a great set of battle animations. They can give her funny lines. They can make her romanceable in canon. They can make her a centralcasting strong woman. They can fit her looks and clothes into a pretty but not glamorous niche that makes politically correct people consider her a politically correct character. They can delete sexuality from their entire game world and make the story about other things entirely.But its still a group of mostly men making a fictional woman who is meant to appeal to mostly men so that the first group of mostly men can benefit financially. Thats true of everyone from Peach to Lara Croft Bayonetta Aloy anonymous troopers in strategy games female enemies  you name it. Whether its meant to gratify one group of men by giving them a bikini babe they can enjoy without guilt or another group of men by giving them something politically correct they can enjoy without guilt its all the same dynamic at its heart.,horizon,deef1e5,2,t5_2s5h5

11058729,0,t3_5xt6oh,Im definitely glad to hear this.  For the most part this generation has left me feeling cold shouldered which may have to do with life getting in the way but Horizon is the first game this generation I can say I was genuinely interested in and after the immense praise it got I quickly grew excited.  Im happy to see a new IP such as this striking a chord with so many people especially since its a single player game and even if it borrows heavily from other games it at the very least looks different from most games Ive seen firstperson games are a huge culprit.  Ive always gamed as a solo player first and foremost so theres something inherently endearing to me about Horizon.  Not to mention the fact this is coming from the studio that made Killzone which I regard as one of the most inconsistent and sluggish games in regards to how fun they are and how they feel to play.  Horizon by comparison is smooth and though definitely susceptible to some awkward moments is surprisingly frustrationfree.  At least thus far.  It feels openended but not quite the same way as other open world games.  I could go on and on but point is Im glad this game is doing as well as it is.,horizon,delhlxq,1,t5_2s5h5

This is just another reason why people hate metacriticreview scores.  is a great score but I dont feel the critical acclaim Ive heardread most places is reflected in an . Just my opinion though as are all reviews.That said there are issues with HZD for myself all my opinions story character development etc. is goodtogreat but not amazing a la Witcher  Last of Us some side quests are fine many start to get slightly repetitive vs human battles are... well you know...And just some preferences can get annoying hunting for medicinal plants to fill my bag so very slowly wouldve liked a quicker way to swap out weapons from your weapon wheel also wouldve liked the item wheel to have  assignable options for each direction to make it easier to set what items youll use for any given battle. Would be easier than scrolling through a list of ish items while a thunderjaw is charging you IMO.Anyway its a great game and cant wait to keep playing it even putting BotW off as a HUUUUGEEEE Zelda fanboy.Side Note I love BotW also from what Ive played maybe  hours so far but there sure are a lot of unhappy people out there about the fact it got so many s though. ,horizon,deo2eaz,2,t5_2s5h5

11139544,0,t1_deu6f1n,Oh no. Loot seems to load into the game in some sort of instancing system based on having to load areas from scratch.For exampleYou buy  mod boxes in Sunfall open them and record what they offered then restart from last save.You fast travel to Nora Hunting Grounds and buy  more mod boxes. The loot is different.However if you went to Meridian and bought  boxes from the hunting goods merchant restarted from save and then bought  boxes from the mystery merchant  the loot would be the same.The game seems to loadroll loot tables when it loads the rest of its assets. What I really want to know is if the very rare mod loot table is shared between boxes and machines you can open your boxes in any order and youll get the same mods in the same order but does that apply to every rare mod source in the same load instance? Sun Furrows Hunting Grounds might be a good place to test this.Edit I forgot to respond to this bit ? Wow thats totally new to me.

The other thread is praising the cosplay and ignoring the fact they dont look alike or that putting on makeup doesnt magically alter your facial structure.  gt its also pretty funny to me that youve responded on so many threads. Its pretty obvious Ive gotten under your skin hahahaha. Its just a picture dude calm down hahahahaI responded to  threads about this topic. No need to spread lies now. Its also pretty weird coming from you the one who responded to more than a few people who said she doesnt look like Aloy claiming victory now after the cosplay pictures weird by itself tbh. So if someone takes this way too personal its you. She doesnt look like Aloy because her face looks totally different. Not my problem if the truth somehow offends you or something. So feel free to accuse me of being salty or whatever when you are clearly the only one of us two who is emotionally invested in this. Its weird you know.

11252041,0,t1_df6ssr5,This sums it up perfectly. The combat is a chore and it isnt rewarding like a balanced game in the vein of bloodborne. I fought each bot like three times and they got boring as shit. Some are pathetically easy. Others are difficult in frustrating ways. The map isnt big enough for all the congestion and despite being surrounded by expert hunters aloy is the only one who can do fuck all to the bots. You always end up in fighting seven glinthawks or a couple snapkaws that spot you randomly from a ways away. It just doesnt seem fully realized even the dope concept of a story is hindered by the fact that the voice acting and at times writing feels more like Fallout than something really thoughtful or serious. Despite the games tone it sort of seems to struggle between... the world of Warcraft movie and the lord of the rings if that makes sense. Not quite silly and not quite serious. ,horizon,df7ehlf,2,t5_2s5h5

11269408,0,t1_df8hmlz,I dont understand the thought of using precision for high damage honestly.

11272138,0,t1_df9j175,One point Id argue on Id say all fiction strives for internal consistency. The difference is that nonsciencefiction stories dont rely on science factstheories for that consistency and instead try for precedence... if magic worked one way before it should work the same the next time unless theres a new factor usually narrative in play. Things should never contradict past events and if they do there should be some sort of information to be uncovered to explain why there appeared to be a contradiction.Inconsistency is a mark of bad fiction regardless of genre.

Theres that small scene where they briefly talk about it which also teaches one how to use it to take out machines. Its her first big kill so its an important step for her.  A New Game would have to alter that quest since youd already have it from a previous save.

11292389,0,t1_dfbxnsx,That is not going to work then. I am still baffled by all of your autosaves being at the beginning of the sequence. At this point if you only have access to the tripcaster and hunter bow you are going to have to try to power through it unless you decide to start over. My suggestions if you have not already done all of these. As soon as you get your gear back go into your inventory and make sure you. Have the best mods on your gear that you have in inventory. In this case that means for your bow you want high tear and damage and you may want to switch mods in and out during the battle  to fire if you want the fire arrows to have more effect. For the tripcaster you want damage and fire. You want melee protection on your armor. You did not talk about armor in your post so I do not know what you have.. Go into the machine notebook and really study the weakpoints on the beast and memorize where they are.. Try starting with the hardpoint arrows and working through the armor on the head frontloaders butt freeze cells then belly cargo container switching to the tripcaster when you get any short breathers e.g. running behind the posts to lay down some wire. You can also try to catch the behemoth in wire on the run but that is not going to be fun. I know this is also tough to do on the run but try to target one body part until you get some serious damage to it.Good luck!,horizon,dfbz5fm,1,t5_2s5h5

Having visual swap between armor is inelegant and immersion breaking but its easier to implement. Maybe there should be a version of each armor that look identical to the original but have no stats but with extra mod slots to customise them how you want.Then maybe have some flavour text explaining how those armor are like that. Its kinda convoluted though. Yeah game design is hard. ,horizon,dfcfnuj,1,t5_2s5h5

Those Tallnecks. st one I saw I had to stop playing and look at it for a bit. So bloody well created. Same with Sawtooth. Same with Thunderjaws. st time I saw  fight with Snapmaws again I put down the controller and had to just watch it.

11530926,0,t3_64ksbu,Well the simple answer as to why he was allowed to keep his authority to mess with Gaia is He Wasnt.  He didnt have any official access.

When he convinces Elizabet to give Gaia a KillSwitch hes not saying Were doing this because I say so hes very clearly trying to convince Elizabet to do it which she ultimately agrees with only after Gaia herself agrees with Ted.So yeah he didnt have any official clearance to affect the project in any way.But you have to remember two key facts Ted funded the entire project and provided all of the Software and Hardware. The entire Apocalypse happened because the AI for the Faro Swarm didnt have a Backdoor.Ted was very deeply affected by what happened with the Faro Swarm.  It is entirely likely that after it happened he had every Engineer in his company spend every moment available to install a Personal Backdoor into literally every single piece of Software his company had ever made under the general term Omega Clearance.  When Project Zero Dawn started he provided all of the Hardware and Software so all of their systems also had that Omega Clearance Back Door.,horizon,dg316lj,6,t5_2s5h5

11648648,0,t3_664upi,It depends on you entirely. The game requires you to think and prepare for engagements but its not about stealthnonstealth and rather about which weapons to use and which weak spots to aim for. Also its full of moments when unexpected patrol or a pack of scrappers drop by in the middle of a fight so you have to improvise.Humans are not super fun to deal with and sneaking and headshots is preferred although boring strategy against them. But again it depends on you. For example Im on my second playthrough and I was on that mission with lots of humans and machines you need to get through and Ive just cleaned a bandit camp and was like oh no another half an hour of crouching and aiming for their heads. But there was a corrupted zone nearby with two ravagers so I shoot off their cannons and used them to clean the whole place in  minutes.

11669904,0,t3_66haj9,I love this idea and have been thinking about it a lot myself. I played a lot of MGS in the past and what I always loved about those games was the option to kill or to stun guards  basically you could play the game without killing anyone and you would be rewarded more the less you kill. You could still go in all guns blazing but the choice was yours. My one complain so far about HZD is how cursory the human fights are and how little you can do other than simply cut them down. I feel like in a postapocolyptic world life would have more value  to the outsider in particular. Likewise I played through the first part of the game killing no animals and was sad to find out I had to to develop certain items. Now this again is just me personifying the character but I imagine in that sort of world a more balanced sense of give and take  again rather than literally running around slaughtering animals and other humans without it taking any sort of toll on the character to me seems a little incongruous but of course the opposite might be true  in a world filled with savages perhaps killing to survive becomes mundane. Either way Im with you on this and I feel like the game developers missed something by not giving Aloy certain caring empathetic qualities in terms of her relationship to nature  other animals. Or more I suppose its about letting the player decide. I love that idea the most. Like if I could buy in Meridian or from Merchants alternative products to create these larger hypothetically implausible anyway pouches etc I would have been much happier. And similarly giving me a way to clear bandit camps without killing anyone would have been a great option too. Although considering how satisfying the machine battles are I appreciate that the human fights were of secondary concern to the developers and so considerations of choice in terms of how you defeat these enemies was probably far down on their list. Anyway for the sequel I would love to see more thought put into these areas  how the characters relationship to the world affects her decisions for instance or alternatively how the players choices affect the characters relationship to the world like how in MGSV you become a deamon if you kill too much etc. ,horizon,dgissdk,5,t5_2s5h5

Once I understood the mechanics of shooting weak spots with the right arrow type during combat the fun factor of combat went way up.By way of example a trampler has a LOT of hp and it can take a very long time to whittle them down.

11809081,0,t3_68hv8p,Are you the one with all the videos on YouTube that say to do this?  I agree that its effective but I strongly advise against people doing it.  The combat in the game is one of the bests part of the game.  This method effectively eliminates combat.I also dont think its an intended use of the tripcaster.  Im a little surprised they let you put  down in the same place.  That wouldnt be physically possible after all.  They let you put down  so you can lay a bunch of individual traps but realistically you wouldnt ever put  on them on top of each other.I guess I just see it as deimmersing yourself while you also deprive yourself of some of the best fun.  The method is effective but its not recommended to be that effective.  Its kind of like the shieldweaver armor which is also rather OP except the armor is limited in when you can use it.Mind you for people with limited time its probably a lifesaver.,horizon,dgylmey,4,t5_2s5h5
