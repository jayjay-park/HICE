2266144,0,t3_2l66fp,A major flaw IMHO in the NFL belt history as its popularly given is that it justifies beginning it with the Green Bay Packers by their winning the Super Bowl. This is inconsistent with how the belt is won at any other time.umecromace traced the belt back to the very beginnings of the NFL using a more logically consistent systemgtI currently have the title begin as vacated and award equal shares to each team when a title is vacated so theres always a partial claim until all shares are unified together into a full claim. If a franchise with a partial claim folds then that partial claim is vacated leaving the other partials to eventually merge together. If a franchise with a full claim folds the title is vacated and equal shares are spread out again to qualifying teams.Fortunately the Green Bay Packers won the NFL belt in the first Super Bowl so mecromaces research does not undermine the existing history of the NFL belt.Another interesting point of his research is that the AFL started as a separate league with a belt of their own that was not carried into Super Bowl I. Thus the AFL belt persisted even after the leagues themselves were unified. However the Green Bay Packers unified the title on September   by beating the Eagles in the first game of the season and since then the AFL belt as a separate title has ceased to exist.I really liked mecromaces post and I had the devil of the time finding it again so Ive posted it here now for posterity and anyone else whos interested.,NFLtitlebelt,clrtcwi,1,t5_2xqla
