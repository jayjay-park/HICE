469567,0,t3_1zewdc,I EDC an SC. Its a pig for sure.  Especially w a CL laser light combo amp extended mag but I have twice the round capacity of my XDs counterparts without changing mags.IMO Id get the XDs for CC.  Obviously effective CC depends on you having the weapon w you amp that depends on the weapon being light amp comfortable.  A double stack will have u thinking far too often Ill just leave it in the car for a minute or Ill be right back.Ive never been in a situation I couldnt end w  rounds but Ive been in a couple that wouldve gone a different way had I not had my XD on me. ,SpringfieldArmory,cftn3rw,2,t5_2w31p

6083115,0,t3_3yvamz,I filled out my form online yesterday and I thought it said somewhere that it could take  weeks. Im hoping that is something they said to make sure they have plenty of time and it comes sooner but Im not going to plan on having it before then. Edit just checked the form my LGS gave me and it says  weeks. ,SpringfieldArmory,cygz7lx,2,t5_2w31p

10033253,0,t1_dbfbswh,Anything is possible with enough time and money! But yeah Id go for a full size gun if you want to use a red dot. I dont read of many people using one on a carry pistol and thats what the XDs is explicitly designed for even the  barrel version.Ive seen people put then on dedicated home defense guns but again those are longer barrel higher capacity guns.The main reason you see people putting red dots on pistols is for race guns.Edit I was incorrect about carrying concealed. It is not detrimental.,SpringfieldArmory,dbfcy9k,1,t5_2w31p
