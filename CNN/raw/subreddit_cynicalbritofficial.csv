Hes not a reaction channel hes a critic. The only reason he was making MoG was because he didnt have much time for all the games he got but if he can do it in an hour he  absolutely should. If he can give every game  hours he should do that too but thats unrealistic.I never understood why people complained about WTF is... format changing to become well better in every way because it wasnt his raw reaction anymore.

The speed of the game itself would depend of what class are you using and how you do it.  TB forgot to use the backwards firing most of the time  and he only used the agile class for a  of the video. With that in mind  Overwatch has a lot of characters with movement skills  even some tanks like Winston or D.va which is why it feels so fast paced same with dirty bomb having a run button for everyone. If anything I would say Lawbreakers has a regular time to  kill and speed in general. ,cynicalbritofficial,d45spyp,1,t5_3ezcu

7932225,0,t3_4nv79r,Personally I think that it is the exact right thing to more or less go about your day as usual after such a tragedy. Firstly why give one person unelected and uncalled for the power to shake a nation? Is it not inviting repetition to show someone that he holds political or economical power by murdering people?Secondly if you expect deep participation in some sort of condolence ritual it will quickly become dishonest and disrespectful in its ritualism the opposite of what it should have been. Thirdly while I do not want to diminish the extent of any tragedy especially not one that just happened every day approximately . people die. Any of those deaths save perhaps for those happily falling asleep forever in the circle of their loved after a fulfilled life is a tragedy. You cant apply math to human suffering but still if we were to give all of them even only those that die of heinous murder as these did the respect and recognition they deserved we would get nothing done anymore. Which perhaps sounds a bit cynical but it isnt meant to be.None of this is meant as a criticism against anyones mourning. I approve of the decision of TB to hold a minute of silence for example or of one of the hosts in the E show wearing a badge in recognition.

The reaction to that game has been interesting to say the least people were really let down by it after years of hype and a rather shady Kickstarter campaign plus the delaysthey werent even for good reasons they were just for fixing online features that nobody cared about or asked for and the game still feels rushed as it has problems with crashing all the time even to the point of bricking Wii U consoles didnt help.  ,cynicalbritofficial,d4j18ge,1,t5_3ezcu

8063244,0,t3_4pnfvp,I like these inside baseball videos.  I actually find criticism of bad games highly useful and would still prefer to see opinions on them if played rather than tossed because they arent interesting or high profile.  This plays into my second point as well that devs may be well influenced by critics and thats just fine.  Critics have a lot of experience and usually provide a lot of detail around the reasons for their opinions.  If i were looking for feedback on my game Id much rather get it there than a steam review.  My guess is that Cliffy mentioned you not because they want to make a game that you in particular enjoy but because you made well thought out criticisms the team agreed with.  Nothing wrong with that.,cynicalbritofficial,d4mdusk,2,t5_3ezcu

8072696,0,t1_d4mgfh5,Now you see why TBs answer is the right one. Theres no winning that conversation because people that are on the other side no matter which side you pick will be upset.Now because I dont have a YT channel I will say I can see why people would be against the decision. What you said about racism does apply to some people. I see the same in people that support Trump. Thats not to say its all or even most people that are that way but a few are reacting out of racism. More are likely reacting out of fear as with here of people coming in with no controls. I truly think that without the collapse in the middle east and the mass exodus of people from the area the issue of a Brexit either would not have come up or would have gone the other way.  Something that confuses me is why something so major even if it has no binding value was set to only require a majority of voters instead of a twothirds vote? Seems that  vote would have more clearly reflected the will of the populace as a simple majority vote that is so close clearly shows that nearly half the people did not want to leave the EU at this time. Which is why you already see places like Scotland talking about a new vote to leave the UK before the UK actually leaves the EU. Im not sure that would have happened if the vote had been overwhelmingly in favor of leaving the EU.,cynicalbritofficial,d4ng3x0,2,t5_3ezcu

If Ive bashed my head against the wall for  times with the same loadout I think it should be apparent enough to the game dev that hey maybe we should let this guy experience at least some portion of the rest of the game.Im not a Roguelite purist and if a games pull on a mechanical level is simply its difficulty then Ill find it shallow in scope.

It already takes a long time to get through them and all they do is search for the game and try to see what it is based on screenshots and a couple of lines of description. Now they would have to really research the game to get a good idea about what it is since they cant just go yeah it seems like this lets move on to the next.Second of all it serves its purpose. It is Steam releases of the week its not their fault half of it is shit. I still would like to know what they are since I dont visit the Steam frontpage every day to see whats new.Finally for those who say do away with it altogether this segment  plays a huge part in TB and Jesse if not Dodger to look at a game or two and think maybe Ill focus on this when it comes out. Fan Fridays and WTFsAfter Hours have frequently featured games that seem interesting when they look at the list in the podcast. Also you can and some of you do stop listening when it comes to that part. Thats why its useful to have it at the end. You dont like it stop listening. But I like that segment.Plus when something is early access they say it anyway. So I dont see why it should change to be honest.,cynicalbritofficial,d65xh5s,1,t5_3ezcu
8586535,0,t3_4xeq65,This looks like they did a Console first development approach.What this basically means is you do a general build first and then optimize it for a specific platform. The game can then run on this platform but will run very very bad on everything else.I am totally stunned why people always use the words optimize for PC. It makes literally no sense because you cant optimize for a range of different machines  optimizing literally means you focus on one setup at the cost of everything else for example if you have like  of times the same setup.What really happens when PC games are ported from consoles is mostly codecleanup You throw away all those crappy optimizations you did for consoles. Now it comes down to design. If you had a bad architecture and invested nothing to easily remove that code you end up with a lot effort needed to make the code clean again.Or ofc to come back full circle you just dump it on the other machine and hope you can get away with it somehow. Which ofc will never happen on PC because you have so many different setups luck will never be in your favor. Edit For those interested in code cleanup console optimizations undo etc. i could recommend this   parts in total  its a nice developer diary how to get of legacyplatform specific code and what it can involve ,cynicalbritofficial,d6ewl17,100,t5_3ezcu

8705308,0,t3_4z8kx7,I was thinking about this too. It sounds fine in theory but in practice it would be impossible for someone like TB to get such conclusive data. The kind of data TB is able to acquire is general but important. For instance if a game is running poorly on his PC that means a lot things things to consider as a consumer such as whether the game is optimized for SLI Nvidia drivers Intel CPUs and plenty of other factors just based on his PC performance alone.TBs PCs specs are monstrous when compared to average consumers PCs specs. So in most cases when it comes to predicting performance a consumer can look at the performance TBs PC got and scale it down to suit their needs. Like if TBs PC is currently running a game at FPS then my PC will probably be able run it at say FPS. Keep in mind that these examples Ive given are generalizations but theyre examples of how a consumer might find TBs PCs performance useful.,cynicalbritofficial,d6tsqay,0,t5_3ezcu

Too low an FOV causes motion sickness too high ruins the visuals with a fisheye effect. If I have to go into gameplay to figure out what angle the FOV is set to I consider the FOV control broken.A fix should be simple.

8714960,0,t3_4zdnaj,From my point of view procedural generation can be great when used correctly and when the devs realize the benefits and drawbacks. The benefit of procedural generation is the ability to have a lot of content created by the computer rather than completely by hand the drawback is that what is created has no real depth of design to it. Take No Mans Sky as an example.  quintillion planets because of procedural generation. That is a great feat as far as quantity of content is concerned but then compare it to something like Mass Effect. Procedural generation cant create lore it doesnt design around history and there is no meaning behind what it creates. It is simply putting it together based on a formula and guidelines.Procedural generation cant make an interesting world. If done well it can absolutely make a nice looking one but it cant make it interesting which is why most good procedural generation games focus on mechanics. The mechanics are the draw the procedural generation is a side aspect to make varied maps to enjoy those mechanics in.NMSs mistake was that they tried to make procedural generation as a means to create an interesting universe and ended up with just a very large one. They would have been better off to use the size of the universe to create a place to explore and then create interesting varied and fun mechanics to motivate the player to explore it.,cynicalbritofficial,d6v0asc,2,t5_3ezcu

8819742,0,t3_50ek6y,Starcraft and Starcraft  have very high mechanical taxes because they are very microfocused games.DotA  has a much low mechanical tax.  The problem here is that both DotA pros and Starcraft pros can pretty easily meet that mechanical tax and beyond stutter stepping and good denial there is a ceiling on how much more APM will get you.DotAs real still is team play.  Being in the right place at the right time is good.  Anticipating where you need to be and being there ahead of time while you teammates also understand you need to be there and trust you to be there is what you really want.  Being able to instinctive coordinate and understand what needs to be done in a myriad of situations is a huge skill in Dota.  You do not really practice these teamplay skills in Starcraft.I would go so far as to say someone who focused exclusively on Starcraft would probably start weaker than someone who focused exclusively on CounterStrike.One of the reasons the genre got popularity is it lowered the crazy click tax and put a strong emphasis on team strategy.  Thats exactly why Starcraft isnt really considered the premiere esport anymore either.  The click heavy mechanical aspects arent very interesting.  Other games do strategy better now.,cynicalbritofficial,d780ghz,2,t5_3ezcu

No MMO to this day has held my attention as well. And there is no way I can go back to EQ I played it to death. It is no fun anymore.  SWTOR has the story aspect NAILED ever since . hit.  RIFT has perfected proper Massive Multiplayer  FFXIV Has made good movements in story and sticking with  character.  WoW seems to be a decent jack of all trades. worse in some better in others. Not really bad at anything.  But none are truly for me. I can enjoy them in  month spurts then i am done for a year or a certain change.  And this is how FPS games are for me also. Until Doom...

Everyone always talk about hindsight while ignoring the people who did call this shit out when it was first announced.gt How so?

The switch is the same except with a handheld gimmick. And yes Im willing to say more people are interested in new tech VR than they are in handheld gaming.

9494153,0,t3_5atc33,So regarding the VA strike and the demand for residuals Its not even a case of devs dont get residuals so VAs shouldnt get residuals either which tends to get a reply from the pro residuals camp of Then devs should unionize too and ask for residuals.This is not an infinite pot of gold we are talking about. If games are no longer as profitable as investors were hoping for because of legal agreements you can be sure itll devolve into a race to the bottom in quality and even more exploitative practices. Also why should an employee even get residuals? Residuals are given to people that risked capital on the project not to people that were hired to complete a task and were paid for it. Can you imagine an office worker or a clerk asking for residuals? Sure that would be great who doesnt want more money... but does that sound reasonable?What both VA and devs should be going for is a raise upfront and better working conditions. Crunch time should not be a thing and even a mandatory and reasonable bonus program based on the success of the game could go a long way. Notice how this bonus program sounds a lot like residuals? Thats cause thats how most other jobs work.

Theyre going to want to farm the specific things that are proven to be most efficient for farming and theyre going to radically out gear you.Anyway sometimes preordering makes sense. Personally I am completely happy paying full price for games from Bethesda and specific franchises like GTA and Mass Effect. Blizzard also always gets me back with new expansions for Wow. Those are games I will lose s of hours in and get my entire  value easily and theyre also games I want to play ASAP. So it makes sense to preorder so I can preload the game and play hour .I dont preorder anything Im not confident Ill enjoy which ends up being less than a game a year but that doesnt mean Im being irrational when I preorder. A dev or franchise can lose me too and its very hard to get a spot on my list. The only dev to be added in the last  years is CDPRCyberpunk  and the Witcher.Preordering isnt some mortal sin like it gets thrown about around here.

11154265,0,t3_5z90d1,As much as I couldnt have been nodding harder with todays two audio blogs the thought in the back of my mind was Why did Cris give him back his SoundCloud?TBs passionate yet articulate rants are fantastic and dare I say much needed but how many times must this cycle repeat itself? He did an entire rant about how insane peoples response to the first audio blog was then ends it with Oh you do mind? I dont give a fuck. He obviously does if hes going to followup an angry rant with another angry rant about the response to the first angry rant.This will inevitably end in more angry audio blogs which will impact his health and sanity him bemoaning how people attack him for putting out controversial content and once again swearing off social media. Until the next time because theres always a next time.As much as I enjoy when he does this because I think his arguments are a fantastic counterslap to the outrage culture that dominates human discourse nowadays I worry about the repercussions to his health and his family when he keeps doing this over and over and over again. I worry as not only a fan of his work but as someone whose own as yet unsuccessful attempts to do YouTube are a direct result of inspiration hes provided. Of course its his choice to make but still.,cynicalbritofficial,dewboji,13,t5_3ezcu

11483227,0,t3_63wbyb,Honestly though why would I pay  for a game when I can pay  or even  after like  months? The underlying problem is overpriced games that ship with half the original content the other half being sold as DLCs.

11508621,0,t3_6495i0,I absolutely agree as I made a similar stance both on my Tumblr and on the subreddit thread TB talked about. Punishing a developer with a boycot because they knocked on GAs door may feel like a cathartic act of justice but it hurts the developer more than it actually hurts the intended target.Condemnation does not promote positive growth. Conversation does.,cynicalbritofficial,dg0i57f,10,t5_3ezcu

11732979,0,t1_dgmd5c6,The anti ga circlejerk is fucking insane on this subreddit. Im not going to defend them but a number of points made against them that are garbage are frequently upvoted. Like this one. who defends a website that forces them to pay extra for any form of purchase protection. They arent forcing anyone. ebay and amazon and everyone else is literally forcing you. GA literally gives an option to give you protection. Its like buying off craiglist. Now complaining about their anti consumer practices of unsubscribing to ga shield ga deal and the hidden costs along with anti developers black market selling of keys and bullying ks a better point. ,cynicalbritofficial,dgpyoql,1,t5_3ezcu

11775791,0,t1_dgum3zu,gt Except he never really says what those issues are    He did kind of... eg bitching about how the game is too team focused so you have albatrosses instead of carrys... which I wouldnt at all agree with. HotS setup you can have things like a talent choice that is subpar most of the game but then becomes amazing once you hit the higher talents very good example being Murkys octopusshark ultimate or  hero which just soaks experience while the rest of the team goes after mercsobjectives or harasses the enemy. At least in HotS your albatross isnt stuck at a low level the entire game dooming them to feed ever more amp more.   Basically salt that you actually have to  way function as a team instead of  or  people mavericking it.    Ironically its that aspect  the map variety  the interesting amp weird hero setups Abathur Ragnaros ChoGall etc etc that keep me interested in HotS and not at all in LoL or DotA. Classic MOBA was played out  years ago with the original custom map far as Im concerned.,cynicalbritofficial,dgutlj7,5,t5_3ezcu
