8542801,0,t1_d68yrsy,Your name is LAITNI VERTIA. You like to consider yourself a NONONSENSE type of troll although in reality you are actually KIND OF SILLY. You often try to hide this fact by emphasizing how PRACTICAL and EFFICIENT you are and how you dont tolerate STUPIDITY.You have a few specific INTERESTS. You really like PLANTS and TREES and various BOTANICAL LIFE FORMS. You manage your own GARDEN and enjoy being surrounded by flora of all kinds. You also like to read FINE EARTH LITERATURE as well as LESSFINE EARTH LITERATURE. You wouldnt consider yourself an expert on books but you are definitely an AVID READER. You arent quite sure what youd like to grow up to be and youve decided that for the time being it DOESNT REALLY MATTER even though it kind of does.You are proficient in adapting your GARDEN TOOLS for combat. You use a SHOVELKIND strife specibus which currently contains two of your SHOVELS. Seeing as how you enjoy reading you thought it would be fitting to have a bookrelated sylladex so you use a LIBRARY MODUS which assigns items a CALL NUMBER and organizes them by TYPE. Unfortunately you kind of suck at the call number system. Your trolltag is pragmaticPropagatorpp and you tend to emphasize the Ls in your text a LittLe more than whats necessary.
