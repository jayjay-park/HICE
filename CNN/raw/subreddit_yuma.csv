1324808,0,t3_297gu3,Ill agree with uHotDamnV on a lot of points but personally I hate it here. I followed my dying mother out here ten years ago and Ive been stuck ever since. The wages are too low the cost of living is too high most city government and nonprofit agencies in town are corrupt there are shitty dive bars literally everywhere  there are some that are decent but for the most part youre attracting a rowdy belligerent crowd of douchebags. If youre into Mexican food youve got basically unlimited choices. As a white guy who grew up in the Northeast Im definitely no authority but the best burrito in town goes to Mr. Gs and Chile Pepper owned by the same family hands down. As for the rest of it its all beans and rice and either toobland or toospicy meat on a plate so I cant really give a good review. If youre looking for hauteur cuisine you wont find it here. There are a few places that are bucking this trend lately as theyre trying to build up the downtown area and doing a pretty decent job. The Pint House River City Grille Main Squeeze  these are the places that are doing their best to turn up the quality and class as far as dining goes. The only Italian restaurant is Olive Garden. Oh Da Boys too but theyre pretty much freeze n serve. For pizza Ronnies is the best in town. Da Boys is okay for pizza but Ronnies wins. Youve got a bunch of Asian places that are okay but Asian Star wins IMO. Lins Grand Buffet is decent but the place has been attracting a lot of negative publicity lately. There was a shooting in the parking lot a month or so ago health department caught them with cats in the freezer etc. The thing that bugs me the most about the food scene here is that there are maybe only one or two restaurants that actually use locally sourced ingredients. Yuma makes almost  billion a year from produce exports. Its an agricultural town through and through yet the citizens here dont get to touch any of that produce except for the snowbirds who park on the side of the road and steal from the fields. Also unemployment. I know youre coming here with a job prospect lined up and thats a major advantage. Yuma has had the highest unemployment rate in the country for the last  years IIRC. A lot of it is due to work being seasonal agricultural work but overall its just really hard to get a GOOD job here if youre not bilingual. If youre an RN youve got it made because theres always a huge demand but the best way to make money in this town is to start your own business and step on as many people on the way up as you possibly can. But maybe Im bitter. As a recommendation the Ocotillo subdivision on nd and Avenue E is a very nice area and has a lot of decentsized houses for rent at semireasonable prices. Otherwise I would definitely look into an apartment complex. There are a lot of volunteering opportunities and the hiking and biking is superb. The river is my favorite place to be during the summer if I can avoid the people. Its isolated enough in spots where you can just float and relax quietly and its always cooler on the water. Just bring sunscreen. ,yuma,ciinp0c,2,t5_2seb9
