7962361,0,t3_4o5pup,I found that bairs off stage when they recover work pretty well. I also find large success in baiting grabs. They love to link things from their grab so it gets predictable after a while.Dont challenge the aerials. Bait them and punish. A nice trick I use is when they do a fair shield it jab  time and dtilt. Most people expect you to go through the whole jab combo but this is not needed past . Its one of my fav kill options when fighting g and w. But you have to condition them dor that or they just mash to get out of it.Another thing to keep in mind is that you shouldnt beware the side b but rather things that confirm to side b. Ive never met a Game and Watch that just side bs out of nothing. One might exist but most like to confirm it with a throw.Also the dair. If they are high enough it acts like sonic and toon link where they can act directly out of it. They expect you to shield so they go for a grab. As soon at the key touches your shield either jab to get out of the grab or spot dodge and punish.I havent played many GandW but this is what I learned from experience. Hope it helps.Good luck fellow falcon.,CaptainFalconMains,d4b1mz5,3,t5_39b9v

People can DI the dthrow up and away and it makes it a little harder to follow up but it should still be guaranteed at lower to mid percents.Honestly just get into training mode with a mario or something and just grind it into muscle memory. youll get it instinctively after some time dthrow gt dash gt uair. These days I find myself doing those automatically even if I want to do a different mixup ill dthrow uair and be like DAMN I wanted pummel release uptilt!,CaptainFalconMains,d4lowyu,1,t5_39b9v
