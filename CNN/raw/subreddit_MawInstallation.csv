1425567,0,t1_ciuxgqk,Yes I was referring to Darth Plagueis. But I think that perhaps Sidious expected Anakins fall to completely sublimilate his feelings. Certainly by all indicators Vader was unfeeling towards everyone.I would like to know if what others think about the lie that Anakins unborn child died with Padme. If Sidious believed that then there may have been no reason for him to suspect that Anakins attachments would come back to life to claim his loyalty. Perhaps that was where Sidious truly failed  he didnt see the end result of Anakins love for Padme.,MawInstallation,ciuz054,2,t5_32f60

In addition the last episode of season  where Barriss comments on how far the Jedi have fallen from their ways was a great commentary. Finally in the Revenge of the Sith novel towards the end of Yoda and Sidious fight Yoda says to himself The Sith had changed.

4080542,0,t1_crldxti,Well remember that the movies were produced first so they dont build off of anything in the Clone Wars. But inuniverse Anakin slaughtered an entire village of Tuskens. And not just the men but the women and the children. Theres precedent for him committing some pretty dark acts and thats when he was still trying to be a jedi. Now being willfully committed to the dark side and also being convinced that these children need to die for the sake of the galaxy I dont find it difficult to believe that he would kill them. The effect of the Dark Side cannot be overstated it changes people. But even then Anakin probably wouldnt have slaughtered just any old group of children. The fact that these beings are Jedi overrides the fact that they are children. Jedi must be killed without hesitation or mercy. Hes already massacring the rest of the temple why is it hard to believe he would kill the younglings too? From his perspective they arent innocents.

Makes more sense than the movie but the movies Solar Cannon is still more canon than the book.  For any of the Legendsformerly EU books written before  it really depends... you can sortof go with the same as above.  The movies will always be the most canon outside of word of the creator followed by anything created in the EU and approved by Disney followed by anything that hasnt been superseded by the new movies.So if you want to believe that Thrawn still exists or that Rogue Squadron was the name of the squadron that saved the day in Force Awakens or that Han has a half brother named Sal Solo then you are free to do so until it is overwritten.,MawInstallation,cydjyrt,6,t5_32f60

7274165,0,t1_d250l47,Im with you on all that but aside from it just being plot holes or lazy production there are legitimate reasons why the Rebels would only be using X wings. You have the supply issue where perhaps they are only capable of getting supplies for X wings in that certain region. Maybe there is an Incom manufacturing plant in that region thus fresh access to new fightersparts. Then weve got the fact that the new X wing is clearly superior to the new Tie in terms of dog fighting as shown in the movie. Perhaps those are all the First Order has in the region so the X wing is all they need.What I cant get over is why the Rebels only have fighters. They make a reference to the Rebel Fleet but all they would have needed to knock out the power station thingy is like  cruisers after the shield went down.

The ones that we saw at the start of the Empire Strikes back. Edit. I forgot to add outsourcing they also hired bounty hunters to look for them which is where we see Bobba Fett in Empire Strikes Back and Darth Vader tells him No disintegrationsFrom memory I think it was in the Timothy Zahn books it was raised as to how could the Empire lose so much control after the second Death Stars demise when they still had such a large fleet. Apart from losing the Emporer and Darth Vader. The majority of up and comers in the empire management so to speak all work on Darth Vaders super star destroyer. Which was destroyed in Return of the Jedi as well as the Empires next generation of fleet commanders who were on board. The other thing that was raised was that the Emporer himself had a form of Sith mind control over every employee within the Empire which is apparently why they were better disciplined. So when the Emporer died that mental force control was lost suddenly and the Generals kind of when blank and fell into confusion causing chaos throughout the fleet and made them easy pickings till Grand Admiral Thrawn came back to take control.,MawInstallation,d2uiytm,4,t5_32f60

When the Jedi were basically the fantasy genre heroes of the galaxy going around righting wrongs fighting evil and fixing things. That to me are what the Jedi are supposed to be. Compassionate and forgiving but willing to fight evil where ever it spawns. IMO SWTOR demonstrates this well in its Consular amp Knight storyAs they became entrenched in the Republic government they sorta lost that quality and became colder and corrupt. They went from being heroes to being diplomats and generals. An arm of the government beholden to the senate and its ineptitude. They do a great job contrasting Yoda and Obi Wan against the fallen Jedi like Windu and Anakin in the novel Dark Disciple.   Vos is captured by Dooku and Obi Wan enlists Ventress help. He brings her to the Jedi Temple where Yoda offers her a pardon for her past crimes against the Jedi and galaxy for her help in rescuing Vos. Windu and Anakin both disagree vocally and want her arrested on the spot but Yoda over ruled them. They were so blinded by their own resentment and vengeance to see that she has changed and pulled herself out of the dark side.

After all if Forceusers are more sensitive to the Force than most other beings then perhaps theyd feel a Forcerelated temperature drop more than other objects including the water would. I also stated above that Leia once blacked out because she passed through an area affected by the Emperor Chewbacca and CPO on the other hand felt nothing at all even though they passed the same area with her.

8652756,0,t3_4xw5rc,I like the idea of conditioning a la The Manchurian Candidate. It doesnt rely on tech overriding their agency while making sense of the overwhelming majority of clones who follow through with Order . They wouldnt even be thinking about what exactly theyre doing while acting out the programming and their minds would fill in justification after the fact. I wouldnt want an army of highly trained soldiers realizing someone had taken control of them with brain implants and forced them to kill their comrades hanging around. But if they act out mental programming and come up with justification after the fact? Well thats basically killing two birds with one stone.Brainwashing would also allow for the clones who did form deep personal connections to the Jedi to have plausible grounds to resist that programming. You could even have clones work through that brainwashing with Jedi companions as they all go into hiding. Personally I think that would make for some really interesting storytelling.Its worth noting that brainwashing would be easier to hide from the Jedi than chips. It would take a powerful Jedi to plumb the depths of a clones mind to discover that programming and that Jedi would need to have a reason to think to do that. It would take a fairly paranoid Master to think to look for that sort of deep programming and then uncover it. A physical chip could also be discovered either in a medical or postcombat situation. It would be a lot safer to hide the kill switch somewhere the Jedi are least likely to find it. ,MawInstallation,d6n7i8j,1,t5_32f60

Even in Legends there are no actual recorded instances of Jedi kidnapping children or coercing parents into giving up the kids. Its always talking to the parents about the options what theyre likely to expect if the kid stays with them and the choice to give up the child.The Dagoyan Masters claims are the only statements that we have in canon  and given that its another Force tradition claiming the Jedi are taking all of their own away from them its more likely that theyre bitter about the Jedi getting all the children and the big Republic backing.

The goal was to steadily increase the power and strength of the Sith while remaining undetected.  As soon as there are two apprentices they can theoretically combine power to defeat a stronger master.  They will then fight to the death for control between each other leaving the Sith with a net loss in ability and weakening the dark side.The Rule of Two took a long time but the inevitability of betrayal and infighting made it the only feasible way forward for the Sith.,MawInstallation,d8shycc,3,t5_32f60

While all of them are set in the same universe  the first three feature completely different sets of characters with only tangential references to the events of the previous books. That was offputting to me because it felt like the stories were just dancing around the edge of the much more interesting main story even though the books are pretty good as standalone novels. By the fourth or fifth book the plot lines finally coalesce and all the grand themes hinted at in the earlier books take center stage to make it a very exciting read on par with the best space operas. The core plot is in   and  but  introduces several main characters so I think you might be lost without it.  and  can be read pretty much at any time since they have almost no impact on the plot but they do provide a good bit of world building.,MawInstallation,dbianpp,1,t5_32f60

There was an intense war the Trade Federation and fellow corporations kept frustrating the Republic much of the Republic ditched them for the CIS. On top of that the sketchy Jedi Order that the politicians knew little about strangely had influences in the government and constanrly intervened. I am sure that many politicians felt uneasy that the Jedi basically controlled their army. All in all there was stress.  Now imagine that after all that your trusted Chancellor looking worse than ever before tells you that the Jedi attempted an assassination on him and that they are plotting to take over. Given that the tensions of the war and frustrating politics had the Senate on edge this would be completely believable to them. They had some people to point all of the blame on and they were given the idea that the extermination of those people would finally bring peace. So to come fullcircle back to your question the Senate was so on edge about the war that they wouldnt need any explanation about anything as long as they were given promises of peace. None of them thought anything through like that. They didnt think logically about those Jedi they only thought the war can be over! and that was that.

The coolest thing about scifi is... exploring the themes and the messages and the sociocultural psychological aspects of it. Whether its soft or hard. The Expanse is great because of its message and its great portrayal of these societies the hard sci fi stuff is in support of that. Star Trek at its best is also when it does that not the turboliliftalating reverse flux phase variances of the deflector dishes or whatever.This is why Hayao Miyazaki should do scifi.
