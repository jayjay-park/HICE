UCF has cheap housing in the surrounding area. Transferring in as a JR you will probably not want to live in the dorms. ,FAU,cp7fwce,5,t5_2s7lp

8999808,0,t3_53eqwi,Depends on what you want out of college. If you want a slightly better looking degree then go with an honors college. But if you want a more traditional college experience ie big campus a lot activities and sports then pick main campus. Ive heard the Honors college can be kind of slow and far from everything I went to Main Campus and loved it. Boca is awesome a little expensive to do things but its beautiful and offers a lot. I had friends face the same decision and no matter what  they chose they were happy. ,FAU,d7tmyk5,2,t5_2s7lp
