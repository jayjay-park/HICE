9004433,0,t3_53k77y,I love hiking this...its only about two miles from my house and the city of Cartersville does moonlight hikes every now and then where they take a small group up the trail at dusk. Its such a peaceful hike for being right next to the interstate you dont hear any traffic at all.,GeorgiaCampAndHike,d7u6ybk,1,t5_389uz
9020599,0,t1_d7vga06,Pine Mountain is a moderate hike up to the top bring binoculars because the views from the top are amazing. Ive only done the shorter loop to the top from the trail head I think it was ish miles. There is a loop on the other side of the summit if you keep going. The trail head is kinda hidden take a right off I and keep going to what looks like a highway dead end. Take the road on the right towards a large factory with a gate the trail head parking lot will be on your left.Sweetwater Creek is all pretty easy to hike which can lead it to pretty high traffic on the main trails most weekends. I went last fall right as the trees were starting to turn which made it super pretty. Side note the mill ruins were used in the Hunger Games so everything was fenced off when I went which wasnt great.Kennesaw is my go to hike. I take the Brumby Camp trail from the visitors center to the Pigeon Hill trail which leads back up and over the mountain its about a mi loop. I usually bring binoculars to look at stuff from the top.Roswell Mill has some nice sights but dear god are the trails poorly maintained. Hiking here was a struggle because a lot of the trails are washed out or just not really trails. I distinctly remember traversing a trail which consisted of some boulders and washed out trees right next to the river was not pleasant at all. Also every want to be photographer shoots here. Sorry I interrupted your half naked photo shoot by hiking on a trail in a public park.Stone Mountain is a packed desolate hell of a hike straight up the mountain. The only redeeming feature are the views from the top.,GeorgiaCampAndHike,d7w4uyf,1,t5_389uz
9309376,0,t3_57xw1o,Its closer to . hours but there are a mess of driveup sites along Wilks Rd off the Unicoi Turnpike headed toward horsetrough falls.Most of them are right on Wilks creek which has some nice cascades along it. The sites are pretty spread out too. So youve got some privacy. Its one of my goto spots when we dont want to hike in or deal with other campers. There no facilities to speak of but youre about a mile away from a pretty legit campground with bathrooms. There are some great spots. I have had a few runins with bears though ,GeorgiaCampAndHike,d8w150o,3,t5_389uz
9648252,0,t3_5d4em1,I went to blood mountain last weekend. Still had a beautiful view little smoky though. ,GeorgiaCampAndHike,da2ci2l,1,t5_389uz
9719918,0,t1_dab6l5l,I didnt know certain trails had numbers. Thanks a bunch. ,GeorgiaCampAndHike,dab6wa9,1,t5_389uz
9951396,0,t1_db4npb0,Youre right I missed that.  I think I actually posted a different article than the one I read that or it was edited later.,GeorgiaCampAndHike,db4oy1n,1,t5_389uz
10546791,0,t3_5r17t7,Also along the hr hike I saw snow in Georgia for the first time in my life saw the beautiful valleys due to absence of leaves and had a great day!,GeorgiaCampAndHike,dd3lhmu,3,t5_389uz
11247513,0,t1_df6se4g,I started Friday morning at a spur trail to Rabun Bald and followed the Bartram Trail to Courthouse Gap that night. I hiked to the Chattooga River Trail Saturday camped and came down the CRT Sunday back to the car at US . In total it was around  miles over three daystwo nights.The views were fantastic for much of the hike but water was incredibly scarce Saturday. I definitely recommend the trek and Ill probably head back sometime this summer to finish the last  miles of the BT.,GeorgiaCampAndHike,df6w0dj,2,t5_389uz
