The previous ones were already downloaded and showing up on the dashboard Id a feeling that maybe I wouldnt be able to access them because of the user change so that was good.

TFtB had a pretty good story witty humour and the right amount of emotional scenes lovable characters and a huge Borderlands reputation to uphold. Where it lacked in the TWAU noir cinematicism it made up in the light hearted story. The final boss fight was great and the music tracks were fitting.. TWAU was an epic Max Payne type noir cop story with the right blend of action lore and story. While the characters werent as memorable as Gortys or Loader Bot from TFtB with the exception of the main characters and a few others like Toad the plot was impeccable with cliffhangers and all.

So I get it but I feel that trying to get away from David at all costs doesnt make sense and is rash. She can barely walk and as far as we know Clem has the keys to the only mode of transportation  out of Richmond.

Sometimes Id even just be walking around in every day life and Id imagine Im like a character in a point and click adventure game. I mean back then I didnt have any consoles or Steam or anything so Telltale Games were the only games I played. Nowadays its not really as fun to imagine how Telltale would make something into a game because their games are completely different than they used to be.
