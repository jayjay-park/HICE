2896537,0,t3_2ta0hq,There are a lot of blocks where orientation doesnt matter however I dont know if that is intended for that block.First thing I did on that map was to set up a bunch of eviscerator just to cut a little piece of that whale and try it out .Then it gave me an idea...I feel like a mad genius.BTW this was the first and the last time the game crashed.I checked the crash report it said system got out of memory but it only reserved .GB and used .GB.,infinifactory,cnxc9zd,2,t5_33y54
2905939,0,t1_cnyankd,Challenge accepted!Really though I tend to focus on footprint more then anything else my current goal is figuring out how to make a  by X splitter as that would make a lot of levels able to get a much lower footprint. Im not sure if its possible admittedly but its worth a shot as I think it is.My steam id is xavion for any who care.,infinifactory,cnyetye,1,t5_33y54
2925540,0,t1_co0ke1g,Yeah I saw that which is why I was double checking there wasnt an exploit or mechanic that was obsolete that was necessary with the idea being that if it made it into the workshop prior to a change it could be impossible.  Thanks for your help.,infinifactory,co0n65q,2,t5_33y54

11048209,0,t1_dejvli3,Congrats on your first record!Regarding the gif recorder by default it starts recording when the first output reaches the output zone and stops recording when the second output reaches it. The looped gif will look wrong if your factory doesnt completely repeat itself every output e.g. if you build two outputs in parallel.If you set the parallel products to N then the gif recorder will start recording when output N reaches the output zone and stop when output N reaches it.In your case youd need to set parallel products to  and make sure your solution works correctly for the first  outputs. If it only works for  then you have to record your solution a different way!,infinifactory,dekandx,1,t5_33y54
