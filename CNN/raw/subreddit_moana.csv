9744042,0,t3_5ep3jr,I went yesterday  am theatre was full of kids and there was not a SOUND during the movie!  Its captivating I guess.  But if you dont like standing in line or risking a lessthanideal seat maybe you should wait.  BUT then you have to listen to everyone else gush over it.  Tough call.,moana,dae5ykg,2,t5_2y7kt

9778495,0,t1_dactb6d,The villain makes a lot of sense when you put it into the context of science or even think about how it would fit in the legend.  Lava is an incredible destructive force  but in its wake new life forms because of the rich nutrients. This would definitely be something indigenous groups would be aware of and probably incorporate into their legends. spoiler warning So it makes sense thenthat without her heart the goddess isnt creating  shes only the destructive force without bringing life afterwards,moana,daiey12,25,t5_2y7kt
9829313,0,t3_5evb0r,I was disappointed because Pua seemed to be the better sidekick character. I also didnt really like Heihei for one he was really a liability to the trip and secondly the jokes were really annoying. But in reality I feel like Moana shouldnt have had any sidekick on her trip or rather have the sidekick become sick with whatever disease all of the worlds life was getting after Maui removed the Heart of Tefiti. It would remind her whats at stake. ,moana,daos4r9,1,t5_2y7kt

9916550,0,t3_5hfbhl,The spiral on Te Kas chest was unintentionally revealed after Maui slams his fishhook into her breaking apart hardened lava rock exposing the soft magma underneathThats why you dont see it previously,moana,db05fsa,29,t5_2y7kt
10005455,0,t3_5g684s,I had no idea anyone thought the drift theory applied to anything outside of animals.  If Vikings could navigate all over the world why the hell couldnt Polynesians?  I cant believe drift theory was even a thing.  ,moana,dbbqmze,1,t5_2y7kt
10245661,0,t3_5mou3z,The kakamora are based on Solomon Islands mythology which gives a very different description that in the film. They are instead far more like trolls.Perhaps though the kakamora shells are empty because they are supposedly spirits.,moana,dc5ei08,5,t5_2y7kt
