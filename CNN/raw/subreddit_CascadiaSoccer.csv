3547732,0,t1_cpwdk16,The league tried to wrestle it away from the supporters groups and lost thankfully. I suppose there could be one for the Reserve teams but Id rather a Cascadia Chalice or we were awarded to real teams preferably in a nd Division League. If the three teams were founded to be proper teams instead of just playerholding spots where the best players would constantly be stolen by the firstteams in exchange for the firstteams worst players then itd be worth considering. But as it is its not worth the hassle for any involved amp would be meaningless considering the rigging of the teams.,CascadiaSoccer,cpwnx16,1,t5_2w3kp
