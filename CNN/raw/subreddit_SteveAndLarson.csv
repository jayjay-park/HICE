4603301,0,t3_3bdlmk,Road Dad Reconcilliation  Having left his wife and child in an obsessive pursuit of revenge for those responsible for the death of his father Jack Marston realises that he has wasted his own life and sets out to right his past wrongs. Jack travels coasttocoast across s America in a beatup VW Campervan dealing with his recently acquired Acid addiction the trials of dodgy roadside cafes and with colourful if sometimes homicidal hitchhikers. All of this so Jack can reach his family and beg for their forgiveness. The game could either be true to the s map with accurate towns and an actual paper map as your only guide. Either that or have a series procedurally generated fictional towns following a predetermined road. Both of these would guarantee a minimum of  hours of gameplay with various side missions available every couple of hours over the vast expanse of nothingness.,SteveAndLarson,ctau02g,1,t5_2ygyw

5044930,0,t3_3jzgei,Hey Friendos! Im look to top my previous Red Dead Rename Red Dead Ravishing Rick Rudemption Red Dead Rename This game has you controlling a brand new character Alex. He is a fisherman but not just any fisherman the best fisherman in the land. Trout Salmon Catfish you name it and he has caught it. One day fishing he gets a big bite of which he had never encountered before. Wrestling with the fishing rod for hours Alex finally reels in the giant fish. As soon as he touches it he notices the fish is ice cold which is strange because of the warm temperature of the water. Not paying attention the fish slaps him with his tail and gets away. The next day Alex goes out to the same spot trying to catch the fish. but after the epic struggle. The fish once again slaps him and gets away. This continues to happen every day for a week until the th day when Alex attempts to catch the fish there is nothing. No bite. no ripples just still water. Alex becomes enraged. How dare that fish! I am the best fisherman in the land! Throwing a loud fit that seemed to come to no end. Alex is approached by a fair blonde woman. She calms him and he falls in love with her. With time Alex forgets about the fish and his pride and decides to settle down with the fair blonde woman. On the day of the wedding the Priest say You may now kiss the bride! With a smile Alex closes his eyes and goes to kiss his new bride but something is strange. Instead of feeling the warm embrace of his lover.  The kiss felt cold and clammy. Perplexed Alex pulls back opens his eyes and with horror he sees his bride for what she truly is. The woman he had fallen in love with was the Cold Fish he hated this whole time.

5725259,0,t3_3t28qz,Have you heard of an Wrestler called Jessica Love she is an finnish transgender female wrestler who was contacted by WWE but then she had been thrown away for being too extreme. Do you think this is because WWE is not ready to take an transgender wrestler to the roster or could this have given the roster an great fresh wrestler that the women division needs.,SteveAndLarson,cx6rvwr,1,t5_2ygyw
