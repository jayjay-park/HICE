10282421,0,t3_5lx3vb,I think the average person will get their blue belt in three years. In the gym I belong to our professor doesnt hold back belts based on age but rather promotes based on aptitude time on the mat and to a smaller degree attitude towards others as far as people your age and older go. The best thing BJJ has taught me is patience. Keep rolling the belt will come. ,brazilianjiujitsu,dc9khm6,2,t5_2uola
