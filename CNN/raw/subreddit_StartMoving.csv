5443432,0,t3_3phx5g,How did it go?These bug me a little bit too. In a prone position slightly below the Tposition I get some painful snapping not audible in my left shoulderupper arm somewhere around the lateralanterior delt. Not entirely sure which connective tissue linesling Im pissing off there..Its most notable when I try to focus on thoracic extension at the same time by raising my upper body through extending only from the tspine with a packed necktucked chin and without involving the glutes. So Ive completely regressed them to standing for now no pain there but a tiny bit of resistance at that angle. Im trying to isometrically contract that resistance away by doing very slow movements back and forth at the offending angle under full voluntary tension.,StartMoving,cw7g8mv,1,t5_353w3

6627312,0,t3_46ga9z,A facebook comment on this movement in Deweys own words What you will find shocking is how difficult this is with the added lever length of the clubs. This is only  lbs and its murder. I am using two clubs in this version to aide in irradiation and give myself feedback if my torso wants to rotate and cheat too much. The stress in the axial rotation portion is incredible.,StartMoving,d04tknu,1,t5_353w3
6696733,0,t1_d0blv7p,I know   I really do so much thinking during it though... I fear Id weird myself out by the mismatch of internal focus to external ebullience... like some pageant queen with sparklers..,StartMoving,d0c00i8,1,t5_353w3

9013393,0,t1_d7ulb96,Yes its a concept I struggle with from time to time because I know that some of the positions I am working toward make no or very limited appearance in my daily life or practices. I would like to incorporate practices that would change that which is part of why I am still working toward them but I also know that its a bit of a backward approach as actually having the need on a daily basis would greatly increase rate of progress.Its like practicing the resting squat position once a week in hopes of perfecting it so that you can use it daily  Seems absolutely silly yet I continue on...And then I have to consider the hard questions like if I havent already incorporated the practices that will use the new ROM at least to some extent will I really incorporate them once I achieve the ROM? Am I just chasing the ROM for the sake of chasing the ROM? I do think about these questions but I tend to avoid answering them ,StartMoving,d7v9pkz,2,t5_353w3
