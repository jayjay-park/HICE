626424,0,t1_cgbgddk,Yes buying a first tie and not really tying it properly would be awkward and incongruent. Who knows I just asked my SO and she said it could be cute and endearing to see a shy guy go to such effort like that but I reckon itd be a bit offputting as silly and dorky.   Quiet and reserved is OK but fumbling and mumbling isnt attractive to most maybe only to some like those rescuers and Oh I can change them and make them better types and boy thats a never ending cycle and trap P ,CougarsAndCubs,cgbh4io,2,t5_2ywas

1439064,0,t1_ciwl6zk,Id say take it one step at a time... worry more about the conversation because thats what will make you both feel more comfortable around each other. If that goes well if you have a chance to touch her or sit closer together see if shes willing to let you. Back off if she stiffens up or asks you to of course. Personally Ive found that getting to the first kiss is the trickiest part. Things get easier after that.Or maybe shell take the lead and youll be the one deciding what youre ready for.  Post an update afterwards? Even if it doesnt work out?,CougarsAndCubs,ciwnvvp,1,t5_2ywas

4820079,0,t1_cu22kxc,Thanks for your comment. To be honest it was a little bit my fault that I didnt skype with her when she asked but I was just so nervous. When I made the post on craigslist I literally made it just to see if it worked I didnt expect to get a response so I wasnt really ready for it when we started chatting.That said I offered her ample opportunity to skype and maybe I should have taken it as a large red flag that she couldnt although I kind of ignored it considering Id refused to skype the night before. Whoever was emailing me offered to take me to somewhere or go for a drive for a bit beforehand but I stated I really didnt mind what we did and she said meeting at the hotel bar would be a nice start so yeah thats how that went. We didnt really have much time if it had gone down and I guess whoever was emailing me wanted it to seem like should make the most of it.Thanks for your kind words ,CougarsAndCubs,cu23zo0,3,t5_2ywas

5944356,0,t1_cxy26o2,From the other side being  and having dated much younger men it can be is very rewarding and exciting. The things I have worried about is always if I am hurtingtaking advantage of them even if Im clear about my intentions they are inexperienced and I dont want to hurt anyone. I think you prioritizing something platonic is very sweet. However its probably true that not many  women are interested in teenagers. Be open to other women. ,CougarsAndCubs,cxyu2jp,1,t5_2ywas

7853652,0,t1_d3ymitg,I couldnt do it in a full on relationship. I suppose if I was single I could be interested in a dominant older woman for a little bit maybe longer but I wouldnt want an actual loving relationship of that nature,CougarsAndCubs,d3ytkd4,2,t5_2ywas

9204238,0,t1_d8hsaqf,I agree with grumpycateight. Its always scary approaching or initiating a conversation with a woman. But thats the thing they are just like any another human being with feelings responsibilities problems and such. All thats needed is a simple hello to start things off. Conversations are not suppose to be perfect or played out a certain way. You just go with the flow and get a feel for each other. Now with anything it takes practice and the more you do it cold approaching women the better and easier it will get itll start to become second nature just like talking to one of the guys. Dont put the pussy on a pedestal or anyone on a pedestal treat them all the same. Train your mind to think this way this will release some tension clear your mind a bit and relax you. I believe in you!,CougarsAndCubs,d8ipf7h,3,t5_2ywas
