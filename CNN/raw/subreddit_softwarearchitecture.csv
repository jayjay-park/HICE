2369389,0,t3_2lsgql,router gt controller gt services gt models make more sense to me. There are many instances where the business workflow requires you to deal with multiple models. You need someone to orchestrate this and the service layer does this nicely. Otherwise  you will have a bit more coupling among models. Alternatively you can use the router gt controller gt model gt services approach if you treat the service layer purely as a collection of utility services Like email. In this approach you could use something like Domain events  to get one model to response to another. But I doubt whether thats the original intent of Domain events. ,softwarearchitecture,cm4kchg,1,t5_2zim0
