4791913,0,t1_ctxro5x,Had time to do more testing. Discovered the SLI Optimization ON versus OFF difference is inconsistent. Sometimes there is a bit of a difference and sometimes nearly none. I also disabled SLI entirely in NVIDIA Control Panel. Following are the results just picking the numbers from the first scene of the full benchmark for an example. XSplit OFF  s to s XSplit ON and Optimization OFF  high s to low s XSplit ON and Optimization ON  mid s to low s XSplit ON and Optimization OFF and SLI Disabled  high s to low s XSplit ON and Optimization ON and SLI Disabled  s to sAgain the above is just from the first scene  numbers are sometimes higher in other benchmark scenes but in general they seem to have about the same scaled discrepancy between each setting.As we can see single GPUOpt performs better than everything except turning XSplit off. It still takes a beating though. Generally sticking around ss instead of ss.One curious thing I did notice is that XSplitSLI results in a LOT of IO around MB to MB.  XSplit wo SLI results in very little IO with some pockets of MB to MB. SLI without XSplit behaves like XSplit wo SLI usually only kilobytes with pockets of MB to MB.I presume XSplit has to deal with a lot of data when doing frame capture or buffer capture or whatever it is doing when SLI is enabled but it seems curious that it is so dramatic in comparison to singleGPU.,xsplit,ctyk5r7,1,t5_2u3og
4931378,0,t1_cufrcnu,These options do not exist in my live control room. At all. I have spent the better portion of last night and this morning trying to figure this out. It should be simple but it is not. ,xsplit,cug50lo,1,t5_2u3og

6029497,0,t1_cy9jje7,yup i actually gave up support couldnt help me bought a Live Gamer Extreme seems to work for the time being.,xsplit,cy9zigq,1,t5_2u3og
6177849,0,t1_cyp8xbj,Im so glad it worked out for you!!From what I understand it is just some default settings for people who want to hop into a game and stream so it has the defaults to just pick up everything that way people dont have to play with settings. Unfortunately though that doesnt really work for any Im going to say advanced users but even then that is incorrect as they typically want to do a little bit more than just a simple plug and play.,xsplit,cyruvdf,1,t5_2u3og

8136025,0,t1_d4uemdn,ya.  I had to use  Frames and do so at  ms and that seemed to put it similar though not as detailed as the  FPS but hey it works.I dont usually do images and if I do any modifications Paint.Net handles my needs in most cases.  In fact the only reason I used GIMP was because that it could make gifs and that plugin I used was meant for the purpose that I needed.Honestly I just was more frustrated that with XSplit I needed to comply with Web Standards as opposed to local system handling.  It does impress me to a degree on how it performs though.,xsplit,d4uka7v,1,t5_2u3og
9026360,0,t1_d7rq15z,This is not an Xsplit problem. The Elgato is known for having this issue with the audio delay but its fine on stream. Been known for some time during  or earlier.,xsplit,d7wtruz,1,t5_2u3og
9650272,0,t1_da2e6kl,When you add an image there are options on the upperright hand corner of the image to toggle where you can see it from. There are options to see it in the stream and in the game.,xsplit,da2lgnc,1,t5_2u3og

10260930,0,t3_5mdl1l,what game are you testing with? and regarding XSplit output FPS is this the streamingrecording FPS or the mixer display FPS of XSplit? any other source in XSplit or just the game source?,xsplit,dc74rvh,1,t5_2u3og
