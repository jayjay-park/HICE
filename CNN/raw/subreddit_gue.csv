2224712,0,t1_clconyd,Mankind is the only species the we know of that uses any sort of scientific method so I dont think you can validate the idea that were obstructing it.Beyond this I think the point can be made that not all knowledge has been good for us or for the planet or by any measure other than those used to gauge how much knowledge weve gained. Science has obviously led us to a tremendous amount of understanding of the world around us and allowed us to discover many wonderful things but its also had a part in many terrible things such as chemical weapons. I believe there is an argument to be made that science as ethically undirected as it is is causing some trouble for us as a species.Let me be clear about this though as I know the first response Ill hear is science is just a method. What I mean is that our modern world gauges its worth on endless technical advancements and scientific discoveries in an age when we have far exceeded developments to accomodate our needs in every area we could possibly imagine. Proponents for advancements in science imagine a world more accepting of it as one which will one day reach the deepest depths of the ocean and the furthest reaches of space but I believe that it is our lack of any sort of bearing for what we should be doing which actually prevents us from reaching those olympian heights. Consider how advanced our touchscreen phones have come in only the last ten years and put that sidebyside with how archaic wheelchairs still are. Look at how many nuclear detonations weve seen in the last  years without any purpose whatsoever except to periodically flex our muscles at neighbouring countries. We can not even say that science without ethics is a positive force in the world because we have nothing by which to gauge whats positive and negative except for the met demands of blind consumption.And yes I realize that Ive used science and engineering interchangeably.,gue,clmm4vi,1,t5_2sgcn
3920760,0,t1_cr360if,The civil war took  lives nearly half of all deaths that America has sustained in all wars combined all because southern elites wanted to retain their wealth through the exploitation of human chattel.  It was those southern elites that ensured that America was one of the last countries to have legal slavery it was those southern elites that would not let go of slavery when the rest of the nation did in the early th century. The south could have given up slavery long before it was forced to in  at the expense of many thousands of lives. Forgive me if I dont thank the South for that. ,gue,cr37b88,1,t5_2sgcn
4144400,0,t1_crsjl0x,gtI was under the impression that vegetarianism was the idea that we shouldnt eat animals all animals. What do you think vegetarianism is?You are correct but I was admitting that I dont have sufficient justification for believing that harming all animals is morally wrong. My argument was that we have sufficient justification that harming some animals is morally wrong and those animals could share the same moral value as those animals we choose to eat. In other words since eating animals is not necessary and there is a potential for it to be morally wrong we should avoid doing it. gtyou need to show why having sufficient nutrients precludes the necessity of killing animals for a thriving life.Fair enough but I feel like that would be quite the undertaking given my definition of thriving. I would be willing to tackle any counterexamples should they be suggested however. Perhaps you correct that this is a gap in my argument but I wanted to be concise while at the same time acknowledging that just surviving isnt really acceptable as an argument against eating meat. gtI dont think my interpretation of premise  is unfair.I was arguing that eating animals is potentially wrong and that some of the harm we cause to animals is definitely unnecessary. These are two different statements.  ,gue,crsofyh,1,t5_2sgcn
8117244,0,t1_d4sfrvm,Well yes it is semantics but semantics is what words mean and how we use words influences how we perceive the world. I dont see why clarifying and specifying exactly what we mean when we use certain words is unimportant in your eyes? The meaning of words is extremely important especially if they mean something different than how we use them and their misuse influences our perception of reality. I am arguing that Will is a disingenuous word to use as it implies conscious thought whereas instinct is something one has little control over. I would celebrate a conscious decision much more than ones instinct. Especially if someone were to use lack of will pejoratively. Why shame someone for an instinct? This is the crux of the issue social stigma and association of honorable attributes to something that is uncontrollable and instinctive. ,gue,d4sg964,1,t5_2sgcn
9369126,0,t1_d93dtkx,gt why does it NEED to be called a sport?There are multiple reasons but one is that sport has become a legal term. There are many reasons why the definition of sport is important from a legal perspective including taxes but a major one is that people entering the country to compete in sports is considered different from people entering for other reasons. This Forbes article talks more about the implications that came with the US recognizing esports as sports from a legal standpoint.,gue,d93lqoo,47,t5_2sgcn

Im talking about coming up with a way you want to manipulate someone planning it and executing it. Getting someone to do something against their will by hijacking their emotions and various other techniques. well designed half truths quarter truths simple faking and disguising intent etc.,gue,d9c3z2m,1,t5_2sgcn
9831027,0,t1_daoqu7m,Im guessing you live in USA. Here in Denmark we arent shy to pay high taxes in order to help everyone. It creates a safe and more equal environment for everyone when neither you me or the person on the street has to be scared for our future. We will always have education available if we want to go for it. We dont need to have a stable family to support us in order to get our education and we dont have to take a huge loan that will cripple us for years to come.,gue,dap060z,11,t5_2sgcn
