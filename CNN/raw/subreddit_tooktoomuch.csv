10920756,0,t1_de6c9r7,Thanks.  It has been ten years since Ive done it and I probably never will again.  Its just something Ill fantasize about for a moment once in awhile.  Not something I think about every day.  I remember the bad stuff as well.  I remember veins twitching.  Or they felt like they were twitching under my skin.  I remember not being able to sleep for hours and wondering if Ill have to have my arm amputated.  Its not good for you.  And its probably worse now that Im older and less resilient.  Its not a strong addiction.  Its just something I remember enjoying.,tooktoomuch,de6ee5j,2,t5_38aq5
