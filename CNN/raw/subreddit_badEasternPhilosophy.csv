5700118,0,t1_cx36gde,Its generally the combination of totally misunderstanding something but thinking they understand closely how it works thinking that nihilism makes them better than other people due to being an enlightened view and the extreme insistence that most of asia was completely atheist for most of its history.

6484867,0,t3_44cb5e,Marxists everywhere though not surprising. Actually in my experience Western Buddhists tend to be modern secularleftists first and foremost and Buddhists secondarily and where Buddhist principles may conflict with their leftismmodernism they will dispose freely with the Buddhist in order to maintain their leftism. This is especially the case where Buddhist views conflict with social justice issues like feminism and homosexualism.Anyway judging by Buddha being a kshatriya giving advice about what makes a good king never demanding hierarchy to be disposed of and also judging by the fact that pretty much all Buddhist cultures historically have been monarchical and hierarchical and also given the Buddhist ideal of the cakravartin it seems clear to me that the primary political form that could be attached to Buddhism would be traditional monarchy though of course in the end Buddhism is a doctrine of liberation and not a political one.,badEasternPhilosophy,czq30e5,6,t5_38999
