10971868,0,t1_debitop,Im also the child of infertile parents. My mom has PCOS she was told she would never have kids. They tried for  years giving up on the idea toward the end. When I was conceived she thought she had diabetes she was so convinced she wasnt pregnant. They found me on an ultrasound at about  weeks. It made my mom a little easier to talk to about infertility because she knew what it was and I went into TTC knowing Id likely have infertility but my mom also didnt understand treatments and why I couldnt just wait like she did.,IFParents,debo5kr,2,t5_3j976
10979924,0,t3_5wrnea,A closed Facebook group what we did and it is working really really well. The group was set up initially when I announced my pregnancy and as a bonus it has kept most discussion about pregnancy and babies off my main Facebook page  a bonus for a few friends I know who are going through infertility still and might want to opt out of hearing about my success.  The only discussion thats there right now is a photo of my that my brother took at Christmas  my hand is obviously on my belly but no comments are about pregnancy  and a few people getting excited and going on BabyWatch the week before Zoe was born asking there how I was feeling etc. The other nice thing about a group is that people get set it up to either have notifications push into them or not when you update. So people who want to be flooded with photos can be and itll post on their timelinenotify them or people who want to find photos themselves can opt out of notifications and have to seek out the group. The only downside really is how you feel about Facebook and privacy. But really  thats part of a lager conversation about privacy our childrens generation and social media...and if youre trying to share pics at all its probably clear that youre ok with having photos of your child online somewhere. ,IFParents,decjg4t,2,t5_3j976

In my case i make more than my husband so the plan is for him to stay at home while I go back to work after  months off. His salary would just about cover childcare costs. When we tell people this i always get the impression that they think its a nice idea but wont work to be honest my husband is worried because our baby is kinda clingy for me at the moment but hoping he wont be by the time he is  months old or maybe it will be worse eeeek,IFParents,df12kpz,2,t5_3j976
11206714,0,t1_df1vtd9,We used a Snuza and loved it. The downside of the Snuza is that it monitors abdominal movement so if baby is in a car or cosleeping it isnt effective. The Angelcare involves a mat that goes under the crib mattress so it can only be used in the cribthe one space youve set it up. So if you have the baby sleeping in multiple places throughout the day its not going to help. The Snuza clips onto the babys diaper not sure how well it can clip to bulky cloth diapers and the owlet goes on a foot.,IFParents,df29np7,1,t5_3j976

11340199,0,t1_dfh9ve6,I dont burp that often because she usually doesnt even come up for air! So probably only once per  oz or so. I figure when I pump it usually takes  min to pump out  oz on one side so if shes been actively sucking for that long thats probably how much shes taking in... Its all a guess tho. Then for the next hour or so she burps sporadically. But honestly I feel like she burps when she burps... No amount of back pats or throwing over shoulder works.,IFParents,dfhe480,1,t5_3j976

11433645,0,t1_dfrpscw,Breastfeeding is really hard made harder by the fact that the only people you see breastfeeding are those with older babies who are all like I GOT THIS. Nobody is nursing at the mall with a week old baby who is falling asleep at the boob refusing to latch etc. I know its hard when you have to supplement but a friend of mine who is a pediatrician said supplementing was actually linked to longer term breastfeeding. Also as far as sleep goes  LOL. I only typed out my whole story of how I got to not safe sleeping so you could see how the best intentions go wrong. For what it is worth we are getting back to safe sleeping as the kids get older. But omg the guilt I still feel over choosing sleep over safety.,IFParents,dfrzq5g,5,t5_3j976
11445960,0,t1_dft6wv1,I love the Keekaroo so much that we bought a second one for the grandparents house. Baby Coffee loves lying on it and kicking it  maybe due to the firmness yet bounciness of the material. I feel like we dont desperately need it as often now because babys poops have gotten less frequent although keekaroo is super helpful with the giant blowouts we get now and he doesnt pee on me during a change as often but it was a lifesaver in the first  months. Every time I have to change a diaper while out or even at someone elses house who has a fabric covered changer and I struggle with wriggling baby and hope he doesnt make a mess I realize what Im taking for granted at home. I think how useful it is may vary with how your baby behaves during a change though. I have a friend who used a towel on her bed for many diaper changes in the first weeks and after Baby Coffee was born my husband and I looked at each other and were like  we would have been sleeping in spitup and pee within days with how tired we were and how wiggly and unpredictablyspoutingliquids baby was. ,IFParents,dfte15d,1,t5_3j976

11478048,0,t1_dfx0um6,Our pediatrician said not to use sunscreen for the first six months because their surface area to volumemass ratio is so high. I asked about physical sunscreens that arent absorbed and they even said no to that which I found a little surprising but we complied. We did have some luck in blocking the sun by draping a light muslin blanket over her body when she was in the carrier but since she was a June baby that got miserably hot pretty quickly so we ended up preferring the carseat stroller with a cover over it while out.,IFParents,dfx1722,2,t5_3j976
