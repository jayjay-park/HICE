3467926,0,t3_2zyr81,This one is great and you CAN do this at home with any pendulum! one tip do it with your back to a wall like he did. It ensures you dont drift forward into the path of the pendulum!Also there is no loss of energy other than to air friction. The reason you see folks do this with very large masses ia because it provides a greater pool of energy to draw from. ideally it goes right back to where it started.,holdmybeaker,cpnkh8k,5,t5_37hue

5023488,0,t1_curhjbz,No. Its the liquid butane which floats on the soda suddenly rising toward the closed end of the bottle when its overturned where theres no exit for the rapidly warming butane to escape as gas without forcing the soda out from beneath it. The pressurized ejection of soda causes quite a lot of thrust just like a traditional water rocket that uses pressurized air to force water out of a bottle. This method is just a more wasteful and greenhouse gas intensive method to accomplish the same thing. The carbonation in the soda does not play a significant role and this same effect can be achieved with plain water and liquid butane or exchanging butane for liquid nitrogen or any number of other liquids with a very low boiling point.,holdmybeaker,curiset,25,t5_37hue
5645782,0,t1_cwwmb5k,Worst damage was done to my keyboard and my hardwood floor which was pretty severely burned after the incident. My foot was hit with a piece of molten glass which gave me a minor burn. My skin was stung by the lithium hydroxide solution but that was fine after a couple hours. Overall the damage was much much less than what it could have been. If I burned our house down my parents would never forgive me...They were very mad and completely discouraged me from taking a further interest in chemistry. From then on chemistry became kind of taboo in our household not that I didnt continue to read about it in secret I just had to hide it from them. I think they were also happy that the damage was so minor and because of that they were not as angry as they could have been. They were furious that I decided to carry out such an experiment in my room on my computer desk.,holdmybeaker,cwwwwm5,2,t5_37hue
