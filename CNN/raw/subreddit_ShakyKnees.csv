10767574,0,t1_ddqiklt,Im assuming since Ive heard that there is no dual stage set up area this year they will have a main stage a side stage and the small Pavilion stage. They will switch between main and side all day and when main is playing they will probably have smaller acts at the Pavilion stage. Then for the  headliners each night it will go main side main. Just my guess though.,ShakyKnees,ddqlg4s,1,t5_361q6
11646910,0,t1_dgg2uuz,I noticed this too. Will they still have that crappy crowded bridge over to International Plaza or crowd all three stages in Centennial? ,ShakyKnees,dgg6w26,1,t5_361q6
