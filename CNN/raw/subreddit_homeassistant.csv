7610761,0,t3_4jjngn,Can you also use these outlets with Alexa through your HA setup? Sorry if you answered this in the video. I cant watch this till I get off work. I just set up HA yesterday by following your setup tutorial great videos!,homeassistant,d37ayhj,1,t5_3bekp
7611815,0,t3_4jjngn,Im sorry to criticize but the title is very misleading. This doesnt make it a smart outlet since it basicly just remote controlling the outlet over rf.Same thing as a Tellstick and Rftrx are doing with further limitations.,homeassistant,d37f9cp,0,t5_3bekp

7872725,0,t3_4mwhxi,Well since I got no response on this I thought I would look at alternative ways of dealing with my Zigbee lights.  Turns out my old Wemo link now supports other bulbs and its supported by Home Assistant.  My old setup on Openhab didnt handle the link so I removed it from my set up.  Adding the bulbs to the Wemo link network was the answer.  Im impressed how fast the lights switch using this method.  I will continue to play with the Zigbee for direct control but this gets me to a functioning setup at least.,homeassistant,d40yt5w,3,t5_3bekp
7954432,0,t1_d4a3w63,I sort of gave up I figured with the limited free time I have I would work in other more supported areas of my home automation projects.  There seems to be enough interest in zwave door locks that eventually someone will get it working.  If not I will eventually just break down and buy a smart things hub and give this a shot.,homeassistant,d4a5igk,2,t5_3bekp
