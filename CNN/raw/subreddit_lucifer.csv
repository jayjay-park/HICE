6685746,0,t1_d0akuwu,Yeah but its an early series and they cant do the avenger thing with multiple main characters. They simply dont have the time to spotlight every main char. Adding Maze would mean cutting some scenes and replacing them with hers and right now you pretty much need every scene to build up Chloe and Lucifers char and personality. Even Arrow took about  seasons to get some semblance of multiple characters featuring in the spotlight to work arguably according to some. They simply needed the time to build up the current main characters. Whiney maze was just a badass break your arms and legs type in the last episode and spooked out Chloe so just wait for it. As long as they dont have Lucifer become mortal to everyone and not just Chloe IMO this series will only get better and Maze will also get more and more awesome,lucifer,d0av4uq,2,t5_2sbp9
6688738,0,t1_d0amq48,I think you are overinterpreting the issue. Keep in mind this was the detectives reasoning. Just because a character on a show says something doesnt mean that the character is right. I mean she is also sayingthinking he is not the devil  which is clearly false. You need to think of her perspective. To her the justice system is probably infallible. The justice system had Choi. But thanks to Lucifers intervention a lie? an alibi? a corrupt cop? he walked free.

7096978,0,t1_d1kpioi,No just like with a rape accusation evidence has to be collected. If you and I slept together after a heavy night of drinking and I felt like you raped mesexually assaulted me I would need to go to a hospital and have both DNA checked and my blood alcohol level which through special programs and equipment could overlook my BAC at the time of when I assume we had intercourse. With that information we could move to arrest and then prosecution.Without that the best I could do is claim you raped mesexually assaulted me. However if I make that claim without substantial evidence to prove it you could sue me for defamation of character slander and libel both fall under this as saying that could make you lose your job harm your reputation damage relationships etc.Im not saying the system is perfect nor am I saying youd get away free of harm those accusations even if proven false could still damage your reputation in the long run from Google searches on your name and news articles or stories about the issue. But its not quite as easy as youre making it out to be.

Even you didnt provide any evidence from the show you gave your person opinion and reaction to the show. And to your one sort of argument it absolutely is boring.

Presumably the same thing happens to other angels when they die only they pop back to Heaven and respawn.Hell Amenadiel spent the whole first season trying to kill Lucifer and they clearly love each other.To the angels theres obviously a difference between that sort of impermanent physical death thats more like a time out to them and true irreversible spiritual death.,lucifer,d9hvnrn,3,t5_2sbp9

9561698,0,t1_d9rmuc6,gt Well this is why Id add emphasis on sympathy.Chloe herself suffered from the loss of a father and even she admitted she didnt know what she would do when following the presumed killer. Both have lost someone important to them and both a mother. As a detective she would no doubt understand the effect jail can have on someone and their family.  Chloes purpose is to protect and serve probably to make the world a better place. Would indicting someone for a crime that really did nothing if anything assisted her with the case help make the world a better place? Charging the woman would just cause psychological and financial harm to both her and her child. There is a saying Law without morals are useless and Chloe definitely lives with some moral standards that affects her decision as a detective. There is no reasons to cause harm to a family already suffering for one blind mistake in a world where criminals are bred and thrive from painful situations such as not having a motherfigure to grow up with. Lucifer for example would be in jail at least  times by now. ,lucifer,d9robqe,9,t5_2sbp9

10461218,0,t3_5ptozg,Knew the sex scene was going to be a fake out. Which Im actually glad for. While I didnt see it as too soon Im glad its still on slow burn.Man Lucifer was breaking my heart this episode. His CERTAINTY that there was no way that Chloe could just show affection towards him is so unlike his normal apparent swaggering self. It was played really well by Ellis and he nailed showing that Lucifer really is still very vulnerable. His happiness at realizing it was real was ADORABLE as well. Poor Linda and her attempts to advise Lucifers family. Theyre all lost causes in the therapist couch.I LOVED Maze trying to get Lucifer to walk out when she saw how happy he was. Maze continues to just sparkle as a character and is superbly written as well as acted. I also really appreciate that Lucifer immediately went to Chloe to demand if she knew. Like it seems sorta accusatory at first but it also had she not already been poisoned served to clear the air immediately. None of the stupid eyeing her with suspicion for three episodes that we see so often in other series. Something happens he goes to her for the truth. I also really think hes going to clue in to her not knowing about it quickly and thus its not going to be her he has an issue with. Im not sure how much space hes going to create between the two of them. It could really go either way. He could go the Spite dad method and push Chloe away just for the sake of that ....after he finds a way to save her or he could realize that if her emotions are true then screw EVERYONE ELSE hes going to try to be happy. It wont go smoothly either way. It never does. But both ways are potential moves for him and both fit with his personality so far. I really dont want this longer break after next week....,lucifer,dctvvuf,48,t5_2sbp9

Technically she probably should have been Celestial though its possible God could have made her stay in that body to make her confront her guilt. Or because of Lucifers punishment i.e. condemned to Earth in her current body forced her to attach to it metaphysically.Personally Im going with shes confined to this body due the Lucifers punishment.
