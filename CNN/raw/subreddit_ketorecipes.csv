269219,0,t3_1x71pp,So the weather is crap over here in blighty and I wanted something wintery and wholesome. Here are a bunch of things I threw together and in true countrywinter style it is filling and has a lovely kick of warmth to it. Method It is a pretty simple recipe and is all done with a mediumlow heat. Saut the onion and pepper with  sausages nice big glug of oilbutterfat. This dish is all about juicy soft textures so dont be tempted to caramelise this part.  Once the sausages have whitened and onions are soft add bacon and chorizo chopped. Leave this for a few minutes for the chorizo to sweat. At this point I sprinkled some paprika and cajun spice. Add the mushrooms these are great at soaking up the flavours and oils. Now its time to add the chopped tomatoes. Bring up to a simmer and add the mixed herbs and sorry I forgot to mention teaspoon of chilli powder. Add some pepper if you wish but there is plenty of salt already IMO. I also halfed the sausages at this point to mix the flavours up a bit more. In a dry pan fry up some spinach and then add to the casserole. Simmer gently for  minutes and devour in seconds. With the soft texture of the sausage and the lovely mass of spinach potatoes and pulses are not missed at all in this dish and it is pretty keto friendly.Please play around with additions or changes as cooking is an art not a science. Enjoy. Edit Im not a photographer. The crappy iPhone picture does this no justice. Edit  As with country cooking it is not about perfect measurements. Add spicesherbs to your palette. Edit  Im a glutinous pig  servings in my pan. Might have to cut down on my portions or stop picking at the damn thing. Edit  should read things to stop having to edit! tquiring correctly pointed out that onions contain carbs and the recipe does not reflect this. The final carb count for this recipe is g per portion of which g sugars or g Net carbs for the Americans. ,ketorecipes,cf8nxzc,2,t5_2t46o

Since you normally have to consume a few eggs worth of egg whites to find yourself at a reasonable amount of food this pushes protein levels rather high for your morning meal usually around g.

I use Syntrax chocolate truffle because it doesnt taste like death but I think IsoPure makes a good low carb powder. Youll also save a ton of money. Ive mixed the powder in to make a fat bomb hybrid Ive mixed it with unsweetened coconut milk and poured it on toasted almond slivers and flax balls to make a sort of cocoa puff cereal. Mix it in with some cinnamon peanut butter and egg batter and made the most incredible eggs in the entire world this is way better than it sounds look up french toast eggs and cream cheese pancakes.I know this isnt exactly the answer you are looking for but Im just pointing out that you will have better variety with powder.

Rootabaga parsnips and radishes can all be cooked and pureed a hand blender works too for something that in terms of consistency and flavor is virtually identical to a potato. You do need to prepare it properly though otherwise youll get that definitive radish flavor to it.

Tbsp unsalted butter  Tbsp coconut oil but I cut up the butter into smallish squares so it melts easier. I use a small cup blender thing. It is like a Magic Bullet but the cheapo version.I put the oil and butter into my cup and the caramel extract it is I think Watkins brand? Or Watons? I found it in the spices with the vanilla which is also an option. I also put in my sweetener which is a couple drops of stevia liquid or a little less than half of a packet of Truvia brand stevia. I pour the hot stuff on and shake it to help it melt. Then I put it it on the blender base and mix. Then I mix it some more.It blends it up well and tastes like a caramel latte. I made one for my coffee loving nonketo husband and he loved it.If you have vanilla I think a vanilla cinnamon combo would be delicious as well.

3046411,0,t3_2v0shq,I made these tonight. I have a couple of suggestions and I may adapt them for my own site after Ive done some testing.. Using a deep fat fryer works much better than using a pan. You can batch fry they dont stick together as much if you want to do so.. You dont need the coconut flour on them. If you have a silpat or some parchment paper you can just wait for it to slightly cool out the microwave and its completely workable with your hands.. Some almond flour or flaxseed may be advantageous to use inside the actual dough. They tasted a little like fried cheese curds if youve had them before. Something to change the flavor slightly to something less cheesy seemed like it helped with the flavor a lot.. They arent super crispy on the outside unless you cut them very thin. I tried using your method of rolling them I also used a method where I doubled over the dough. I found that the best way was to double over the dough and cut strips as thin as I could. This gave crunchy on the outside and a little soft in the middle. I had also cut bigger steak fries and coated them in a flaxseed powder as Ive noticed flax does awesome in deep frying and it didnt work as well at the method mentioned above.Good recipe though  Im glad I tried them for sure. I am going to try to think of a way to impart some potato style flavor into them...if I ever do P,ketorecipes,codrd09,16,t5_2t46o

The problem is that the premixed stuff doesnt have nearly enough butter. So you melt butter and mix that shit  and add a healthy dose of the powdered seasoning to it and inject that meat at regular intervals. Pat it dry. Get either a large dutch oven or a deep fryer and fry that turkey. Go till the outside is a perfect chestnut brown and the internal hits . Normal turkey can get dry.

It satisfies the need for creaminess and savoury flavours. Plus the added spiciness means you get an after taste that lasts a little while and numbs a tiny bit of your taste buds meaning that snacking on something else as well wont taste as good.

6769336,0,t1_d0jbr8z,I dont get it. Do you want me to lie? Theres no way to recreate those sauces with the required qualities. I and many others have tried. It simply doesnt work without starch as it depends on it for both the flavor AND the physical properties. To do it you need starch. If something is wrong were supposed to be telling you. If the the answer to something is no such as Can I make this sauce without starch then we should be saying no. Im not trying to be an ass here. Op gave a link to  sauces and said they can be made keto.  of the  could not and I indicated which. Look if you want me to be wrong thats fine. Itd be great if I was wrong. I miss roux based sauces. But Ive tried to replicate them. Rouxes thicken to a ridiculous amount. Creams and cream cheese do thicken but nowhere near enough to replace.  Gums Xanthan guar etc can definitely get the sauces thick enough but it feels like slime in your mouth rather than smooth. Think Okra vs Mashed Potatoes. Im not trying to be confrontational Im trying to share what many of us have already learned by trying.Edit I literally have no stake in this Ive personally moved to pretty much zero carb but I was doing keto for over three years prior so Im only trying to help because I like to cook and Ive tried this before. Specifically with trying to find a good roux substitute. Heres what Id ultimately recommend. Dont try to recreate the sauce. Try and recreate the final dish. For example a noddle dish using one of these sauces with a nutty flavor? Use avocado and sesame butter as your sauce. ,ketorecipes,d0jl2hn,0,t5_2t46o

Its also a really nice garlic avocado sauce if you omit the tomato. You get plenty of sauce regardless if the tomato is there or not. I love this garlic infused oil...Honestly this sauce might not even need the oat fiberused as a thickener but it really helps when I put Raos Homemade on my zoodles. Though oat fiber might still help in this sauce to hold in the coconut oil. Doesnt hurt to use it its almost entirely fiber lol. Its not like Im using Coconut flour that doesnt need to be used.If anybody is curious about the avocado oil butter I blend up  pounds of amish grassfed butter with  cups of avocado oil then I add pink salt and nusalt.

11398465,0,t1_dfnz362,Wow that seems really excessive when you could easily mix the ingredients together by hand. Sorry I dont have any ketowrap recipes to offer.  I always use romaine lettuce for my wraps. Just google and read reviews. Maybe look for things that use almond or coconut flour if you have trouble working with flaxmeal. But theres really no reason to use a stand mixer unless you are doing gigantic batches. And again definitely not with flaxmeal because its not really a dough. Its just meant to be incorporated with the other ingredients and let to sit and soak before being handled.Oh there are also a lot of bread recipes that are cream cheesebased that could easily be adapted into wraps or torillas. Those types of recipes would make sense to use a stand mixer for if you are dead set on using the mixer.,ketorecipes,dfo024h,1,t5_2t46o

11483242,0,t1_dfxmevf,Thats where you are misinformed my friend. Packets of Splenda also include dextrose and maltodextrin which are high on the glycemic index and increase blood sugar levels and can kick you out of ketosis. When a product has sucralose on the ingredients list it is using sucralose in its pure form not mixed with maltodextrin and dextrose. The syrup you suggested says Splenda in the ingredients list which means it also contains dextrose and maltodextrin. Im not trying to be an ass just trying to educate. The products i said do not have Splenda in the ingredients,ketorecipes,dfxmgfz,-2,t5_2t46o

11587619,0,t1_dg9c48i,Holy crap! Thank you!! I really appreciate the support. It was a lot more work than I anticipated. LOL May I add a tip? If you make one of these buy the regular ol cheap eggs. Skip the fancy eggs for these recipes. The cagefree high omega eggs have a much eggyer taste. Which is awesome for scrambled eggs. Not so much keto bread. The cheap eggs have pale yolks that make for a whiter loaf. ,ketorecipes,dg9gpkj,1,t5_2t46o

Both were awesome. Granted I believe its because I only ever fry them.  Never tried them as a normal pasta substitute because I dont feel theyd work out that well.
