8655488,0,t1_d6n82qz,Youre right there is a lot of stories that could be told about the rise of Hip Hop. But what I meant is that I dont really want a second season because this one was able to tell its story in such a way that everything fell into place and gave a satisfying ending.In a way you could relate this to Mad Max Fury Road the movie is amazing yet it gives you little to no information about the characters or how things are how they are. In the case of The Get Down everything is told in a great way giving a reason for all the events that happened yet leaving enough without explanation for us to fill the blanks with either theories or imagination.If they make a second season and further expand on the main story in the same way as this season then Im all in. And if they dont Ill probably watch it anyway.,TheGetDown,d6njucu,6,t5_36dm8
8661979,0,t1_d6nu9k2,You could actually produce low budget content its true but you could throw money at licensing some as well. M for a license to screen on Netflix would be a windfall compared to what a lot of those films get now.,TheGetDown,d6od5b1,2,t5_36dm8

10337112,0,t3_5o0xdv,You say youve watched the next season as in season  part ?I think theyve foreshadowed that it doesnt end well for Mylene on numerous occasions.,TheGetDown,dcfrq3m,3,t5_36dm8

11507833,0,t1_dg0eu0k,Why? Cant they imply in different ways? You say yourself that Dizzees storyline is implied and not actually explicit so that makes it even more likely that other such storylines wont be overt.Also why is it safe to assume hes straight? Why would it not be safe to assume he isnt straight automatically?,TheGetDown,dg0ex5b,6,t5_36dm8
11521612,0,t1_dg0eh0o,Im thinking more bisexual if anything. He wouldnt have winked at the women that mules drugs if he was strictly gay.,TheGetDown,dg1z5xt,10,t5_36dm8
11525965,0,t1_dg0r2hy,If I recall correctly this is the one where grown up Books Nas is rapping over Angel Dust by Gil ScottHeron. Only ones Ive found on Apple Music are live recordings and they all have a much slower pace. The original version is on YT though.If Im on the wrong episode dont mind me.,TheGetDown,dg2gxfl,2,t5_36dm8
