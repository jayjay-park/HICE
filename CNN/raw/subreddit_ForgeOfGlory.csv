11571130,0,t3_655l2m,You bring up valid concerns. Hero diversity right now is fairly limited. I believe the differences lie in     skills     masteries      base stats     stats gained per level     stats gained on the trait board    Players are using that team because they are base  heroes with the best stats. Same with Guards I guess. Keep in mind this game was only recently released for Android so a lot of people are new to the game. We already know there is a lot of end game content in the Tree of Life Raid Bosses Fishing? Magical Portal Equipment etc. A lot of things dont even unlock until Castle level . Hopefully the game becomes more popular and we can get a community that is passionate about the game. That will entice the developers to improverelease content and hopefully more hero diversity.,ForgeOfGlory,dg7ldi3,1,t5_3jv90
