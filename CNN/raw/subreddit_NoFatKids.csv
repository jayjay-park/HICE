3791016,0,t3_33npxz,My last trimester was in the thick of summer and I pretty much craved frozen treats. Blender ice in season fruits...pulse tell you almost have a slushy. Put in freezer for about ten minutes. Scoop in bowl then drizzle maybe some yogurt honey or almonds. I like crunch and enjoy nuts on top. Id make about a cup of this and it wasnt the most indulgent treat because its just ice and fruit but something about the consistencyslushy that sung to my pregnant heart. I was also known to take a whole avocado and give myself heart burn with the crazy amount of hot sauce I would put on it.    ,NoFatKids,cqoemvs,2,t5_37e23
