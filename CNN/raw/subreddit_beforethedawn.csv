7206778,0,t3_4e66wx,I have an idea to make a map based off either Jeepers Creepers or Chainsaw Massacre and sense I kinda want Jeepers in the game maybe we could mix up the two mapsand have a knd of rare day time map because I feel like longrass and a highway with a church and a tunnel full of dead bodies would be more scary in the day. their would be of course like I mentioned a tunnel where Jeepers kept all of his victims in the film and an old rusty truck you can hide in as well as a few houses including one from the Chainsaw massacre and instead of night vision goggles and stuff the equipment could be like X ray too see through tall yellow grass. Kind of give it a little bit of a Texas desert vibe maybe even a railroad with a stopped train. IDK Im just going wild with the concept.,beforethedawn,d1xcqb7,1,t5_3ca94

7413329,0,t1_d2ks34g,Ill be updating Campsite next. Its the last one that will need updating. All maps after that should be brand new.Im sure every map will get a little work done for Survivor Objectives though.,beforethedawn,d2kuhzc,1,t5_3ca94
