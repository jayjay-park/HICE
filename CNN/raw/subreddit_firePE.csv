7461630,0,t1_d2pj0od,Alberta fitter union is pretty decent highest paid rate in Canada I believe.Im a fire alarm tech no union for us. but we do well anyways.either way I guess hell be in a much better position in a few years as fitter than if he stayed with suppression.,firePE,d2qcahu,1,t5_37nfz
7754382,0,t1_d3nlgkr,Interesting... Why isnt the fire alarm programed to do all the shutdowns etc? Thats how we do it here  one pressure switch to the alarm panel and the panel fires all related relays for hvac doors etc. Except for that and the alarm valves it sounds about the same as us. We do a steel riser up the tower then zone to each floor with a dedicated shutoff and flow switch. So does that mean over there that each level is fed from the ground with an alarm valve in the water entry room? We use Blazemaster CPVC and its pretty well hated here. Im not sure about the install side of it but after about  years it turns very brittle. Replacing a head is almost a guarantee of broken pipe. Why do you guys hate it so much? ,firePE,d3nm5mq,1,t5_37nfz
9262703,0,t1_d8psio8,When I graduated college I didnt think their was one. But there is.MEP stands for mechanical electrical and plumbing. Fire protection if often looped in with mechanical. The MEP firm tells me the specifications they want for a project and I design a system to their specifications. I also submit my system to them when Im done but  it doesnt even seem like they review it that much. ,firePE,d8q445q,1,t5_37nfz
11682580,0,t1_dgk7ucj,Ok. So you got a clay valve. Im assuming its installed right after the check on the discharge side.Those clays only come in  settings  and . It SHOULD have the PSI rating engraved somewhere on the valve itself. Usually right in the middle. Its definitely a  though. You aint gonna have a  with a pump that size. I was under the impression those couldnt be field set. I could be wrong though. Check the gauge down steam of the clay. If its significantly under  psig during churn you know something is wrong. ,firePE,dgk8jv2,1,t5_37nfz
