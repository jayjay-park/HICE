3230154,0,t1_coweeu7,Not to dissuade you from opening it but there are a few toys I opened in the past that I regret. I have this Link and Epona from ocarina of time action figure that is worth a lot of money now....unopened. Alas mine sits on a table gathering dust. I also collected a bunch of the Kingdom hearts figures. I think those are worth more now too. There is more stuff like that but those are the worst. Because they are in such high supply Im not sure if any ambios are going to have any long term value but who knows.,TheSapphireKitty,cowt75f,1,t5_35uvf
