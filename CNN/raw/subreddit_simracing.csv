31210,0,t1_cegmj96,In iRacing the biggest problem I have rookie is being able to drive consistantly while in the lead. I consider myself to be pretty quick so right now even if I take a little damage I can get myself back into the lead however once Im there I often try to relax myself and not make mistakes but then I just make stupid little mistakes. Ive spent time in singleplayer hotlap mode on the tracks its just the pressure of having someone in your mirrors even if not a threat that gets me to make stupid mistakes. taking too much outside kerb on turnin of okayama turn  for example,simracing,cehzh0o,1,t5_2quee

You can use a US mail box in Blaine or Point Roberts.  Itll cost you about  a year  . per package.  I do this very handy but its only economical if youre over there form another reason.  The other is to use a brokerage firm like Seawings Express.

However the wiring is kind of exposed and Ive a sensor fail on me but the customer service sent me a free replacement. Unlike the CSR Elites the ClubSports cant be inverted easily.If you get a V pedal set it has an RC car shock absorber on the brake pedal which you will need to fill with silicone oil that comes with the pedals. There will inevitably be some bubbles in there so after a few weeks of use refill the oil cylinder do this every few months and the brake pedal will come to life.The ClubSport V is an excellent pedal set but the CSR Elite is probably almost as good.,simracing,cf6qf9v,3,t5_2quee

406134,0,t3_1yqkgu,As I just said in another thread here my Fanatec GT has been a true hero for three years now and been going strong for  hours. I think the internals are quite the same as the GT with its motors and belt drives.The belts in the Fanatecs make the FFB smooth and very precise. And silent. The alcantara on the rim is a very nice addition and IMHO the wheel looks awesome as well as feel very very good.A lot of people seem to like the G obviously but I think the cogs in them make it too rattly and clunky. But that might of course just be me being biased from settling in on the smooth belt driven wheels. And on the G package you get an H shifter but Im unsure of the quality for any prolonged use and perhaps someone with it can shed some light on the shifter.Both great alternatives though!,simracing,cfmv1t5,2,t5_2quee

411328,0,t1_cfne7zo, make it to Pro.I had the full support of my team in those seasons the failure is all on me.  of our drivers made it to pro!There are a few reasons I think I failed.For one I struggled to get comfortable in the FW. I wanted to give myself a season to get warmed up and I did. However my pace was still a ways off from netting Pro. I could have been top  I think but not top . I really fought with getting the car setup to me to drive how I like. Thats something that in the SM I never really had an issue with the downforce and speed just exaggerated my short comings.The margin of error in the FW is very slim. In comparison Im astonished at how simple the Ruf is to save from any kind of slide spin double barrel roll. The FW is unforgiving and punishes you for slight twitches. Im definitely not as smooth as I could be. I needed more practice with that and I simply didnt put the time in.In this season  S I made the choice to switch series. The FW wasnt as fun as I wanted it to be. I LOVED the competition driving me and the quality of the races in that series. They however quickly devolved into  hour hotlap sessions. In the Ruf I can get a race anytime I want instead of  races a week and the quality of racing is there as well I see a lot of the same guys from the FW series in my splits racing the GT cars. You can also touch someones car slightly without ending up in the barrier and your race over.I walk away from almost every Ruf race with a smile on my face. I walked away from most FW races and practice sessions worried about doing well the next race.,simracing,cfnef5f,4,t5_2quee

Ideally youd be better off plugging anything that is latency sensitive either straight in to the motherboard or using an extension cable for each device that needs it.However in practice you might find the change in latency imperceptible.

874563,0,t3_243jis,The problem with asking which wheel is better is you get fanboy retards that feel the need to defend there purchase and talk there rig up. I and thousands of other are very happy with our g it is a fine wheel and as a packageprice you cant beat it the shifter on the g gets the job done its just a bit plain. There is no real difference in pedals aside from a much easier inverted mounting option on the ts. Both are just okay in comparison to the clubsport vs with a load cell brake. The THrs adds some immersion over the g shifter but not much else in my opinion if you are getting another shifter get the clubsport sq for not much extra cost being able to switch between sequential and H shift with a press of a button is well worth the extra.  The trs is obviously the better wheel will it decrease your lap times by a second? Nope. It will however add a bit of feel and immersion and it will improve your sim racing experience sadly it just costs a fuck load more money. If i could get a do over i would have got the trs and slowly built my rig up adding top of the range parts as i could afford them it really hurts having to replace perfectly working gear for slight upgrades.  I havent heard anything positive about the f wheel its just there to help you pretend your a f driver i suppose. Not my cup of tea. So in conclusion you should just do whatever the FUCK you wanna do.  ,simracing,ch3owz2,2,t5_2quee

923256,0,t3_24oah7,The most forgiving easy to get into and best value with most content right now probably GTR evolution. For brand new driver but moving into the future I think Assetto corsa might be the most accessible simply due to its interface  fast loading and very approachable tire model. Drift mode is also good at teaching some fundamentals the FFB is also incredibly communicative in AC !If I was asked to list simulators for a new driver that wants a bunch of cars and does not want to fuss around  not be to overwhelmed.  Game stock car Extreme    Good AI very nice car physics and car implementation basically its like a polished RF GTR evolution  Physics are a bit claggy and cars slopy but good FFB cars still fun to drive loads of content and again AI is quite good  good range of cars from slow to fast just about all of them are very easy to drive  Richard burns rally    best simulator for masochists !  joking aside the only rally simulator on the market.  Out of the box very good to play even without installing mods  has good driver school and teaches loads about how to handle a car  how cars move and why  Can get all the above for under I would then get  Asseto corsa    still needs development but very aproachable AI is a bit drunk right now multiplayer is not in the game but should be soon.tm  i racing  costs a fortune and tends to suck people in but its the only option for oval racing and also a good option for people that dont want to plan league races but want league like races  The basic content is fantastic for learning basic car control the recent tire model makes the game far more forgiving as well  If the person has a specific thing for Old race cars RF and GPL are good options. RF is also worth getting but its far to convoluted to use for a new person to simracing and I think might put them off before they get going or get to a level where they see the value in it. Id also look out for PCars when that comes out  though most the cars in it right now are a mess physics wise some are starting to come together and show real promise so be worth trying out at launch. One thing which might be awesome for you is you can do a multiplayer race with you and your dad then add in AI I think this is possible in both Game stock car and GTRE maybe someone can confirm ?,simracing,ch98a05,5,t5_2quee

Obviously iRacing is pretty robust now so comparing the  isnt exactly a  comparison but in iRacings early days perhaps they are closer.Really though iRacing shouldnt have it both ways.

Hell even the GRID career had you collecting money for better teams though it missed upgrading. But on the other hand GRID had you buying cars and team mates which was kind of cool.Would pCARS have had that progression Id probably still play it  years from now. Its so satisfying to put a better turbo on that shitty Ford Focus and blow away the competition. And the replay value goes up since you can choose a different car to modify each time.

4101096,0,t1_crnqo2d,Sim racing is one of the only types of gaming that directly relates to the sport it simulates I agree driving simulators and flight simulators seem to come the closest to replicating a real world activity but you can apply skills in COD CSGO to real world airsoftusing cover communication moving as a teamfocus same with many other games or simulators.  Even totally abstract games still allow you to develop transferable skills making them of utility for a real world activity. Racing and sim racing give you real world experiencePartly but mostly it gives you the ability to train some specific transferable skills you can gain those same transferable skills in most if not all of the driving simulators.  Some cost potentially s per hour of use  some less than  for unlimited use.Thats why prices are higherNot all simulators have higher prices than other games fundamentally they are still software sold to a mass market. Its not a game.Most people playing racing simulators are playing them as a game as they will never get in a real race car of the type they are simulating.  Not sure where you divide the line between gaming and simulating or why simulating is not also gaming at the same time. Sim racing is not gamingMaybe not for a tiny  of users vast majority of people using a simulator are gaming or a mix of simulating and gaming.  you cant compare it to other types of gamingSo if a game has some transferable skill then its not a game and cannot be compared to other games when it comes to pricing and has to instead be compared to the price of the real world activity ? From your logic Euro truck simulatorflight simulatorACGSCRETrain simulator or any software product that is marketed as a simulator should be sold at a price directly related to the real world activity simply because they potentially have a direct real world application.,simracing,crnr0p5,4,t5_2quee

4109539,0,t3_37pabz,Hard call both are great in their each way. DiRT Rally really gets the heart pumping when going fast through narrow woods and the sense of speed can be intense. It is also very demanding and it punishes you hard for the smallest of mistakes.Project CARS is a great simulator in my opinion. They have pretty much nailed almost every aspect and the graphics are out of this world if set to highmax. You can really spend a lot of time in this game just trying to improve your lap times finding the ultimate setup for your car or just driving career mode.If I were to choose only one it would be Project CARS but that is only because it is for me the most fun of the two. And by fun I mean the game of the two I can see myself going back to just for another lap or just to try to lap the nurburgring just a little bit faster.I really like both of these so if you can buy them both Thats my cents feel free to jump to my youtube channel to see ingame and edited videos of both these games nick butcheren,simracing,cropnz4,2,t5_2quee

4193452,0,t1_crxe48i,I know weekends are the busiest Ive been playing online since build numbers sub  so Ive seen it develop over the years but the fact is that it hasnt took off as much as it could or should have. For me the good old days were when people used to race the meganes every night so there was a decent number of people who were proficient and fast nowadays a lot of servers are using third party cars which are a waste of time compared to ISIs stuff. What Id like is a decent base of drivers in pickup races but it simply doesnt happen anymore. Ofcourse ISR were the guys who facilitated that and theyre still getting  drivers most nights but recently theyre using the frankly poor BMW touring car it simply doesnt compete ISIs offerings. To be fair I did get a couple of decent races at the weekend  in the skippy at atlanta with the premier sim racing guys and one in the civic also at atlanta but they each had less than  guys racing though like i say the good old days were back when you could jump into a race in the meganes with  drivers every night of the week. I think useability plays a role in this multiplayer could be much more user friendly and featureful in the menus for example the recent UI update was nothing more than a reskinning it added no useful features whatsoever. I think my point is that I always expected rF to explode at some point so wed see a few servers full of nightly racers but it hasnt happened for whatever reason there are no more regular players now than there was  years ago. ,simracing,cry92xr,1,t5_2quee

It appears that board has both.I have an ASUS PND mobo and I believe lightning blew my onboard USB ports...however it occurred no onboard USB anymore. This occurred before I got my G. To get by for a while I bought a PCIE USB . card. Plugging up my G the clutch did not function and I kept having random FFB issues where when Id start a session FFB and wheel inputs were super delayed and Id have to unplug and re plugin the keyboard for the wheel to function properly. Fast forward a coworker was tossing a couple of older PCs and he happened to have a PCI USB . card. I had read somewhere that the G doesnt play well with USB .. I popped in the USB . card plugged in the G and voila....clutch works and no keyboardlaggy wheel inputFFB issues. I havent tried plugging my keyboard into the same card to see if the keyboardlaggy inputFFB issues persist but my G is happy.

4505420,0,t1_csyjygr,So theres a few different ways that brake pedals can measure braking force  distance Potentiometer based or Pressure Load cellhydraulic based.The DFGT uses a potentiometer pedal meaning that to brake harder you push the pedal further. Simple enough.The CSR elites use a load cell which means that to brake harder you need to apply more pressure on the pedal. Its argued that this makes braking more consistent and gives it a more realistic feel.Standard CSRs use a potentiometer brake so itll likely not be much different from the DFGT ones just with a clutch.,simracing,csyk4jo,1,t5_2quee

4557766,0,t1_ct51vji,Curious how you think it was a crowdfunding campaign done poorly and some thoughts on how it could have gone better.It seems to have done about as well as I would have expected so far.  GSCE is a really niche sim even in the sim realm.  By that I just mean it seems like few have the game.  So to get a bunch of money via public funding seemed like a pipe dream.  Perhaps k isnt very much and that would only take about  people to donate money but even so Im not sure.It was pretty clear too that this funding was for the continued release of content for GSCE while Reiza starts to move on from it and work on their next projects.  While all of the updates this crowdfunding produces are going to be free too.  So Im sure plenty of people realize this and dont feel like shelling out  for something that will come for free.  Im not saying this is right or I condone this mindset but it is a bit of my perception on the topic.The neat thing about this campaign though for me is that if you spend  you can choose to get a key for their next game once it is finished.  Easy way to support Reiza now and get a new game out of them a year or more down the road.I think GSCE is great and wish they would reach their goal but Im skeptical.  Hopefully Reiza can still be encouraged by the hardcore support they have and this continues to motivate them moving forward.  ,simracing,ct54jaf,2,t5_2quee

5046782,0,t3_3k19bv,The PID needs tuning it looks quite juddery when the motors are under load. It might also be an indication that the motors are underpowered.Decent concept for a rig though.Pretty similar to a motion rig design I came up with a couple of years ago As well as having wheels at the corners to allow the whole rig to rotate to simulate yaw I had the idea of using three omniwheels to enable sway amp surge to be simulated as well. Three main servomotors would provide heave roll amp pitch simulation.The design was such that you could build it in stages... Two servomotors to start with DOF pitch roll  Then as budget allows add a third motor DOF pitch roll heave Then add three more smaller motors and wheels DOF pitch roll yaw heave Then swap the wheels for omniwheels DOF pitch roll yaw heave surge sway.That way folks could get the basic frame and add extra degrees of freedom as they can afford parts the motors amp controllers are typically the expensive bits.The design would also make use torsion springs to support the majority of the rigs weight. That way the motor torque is better utilised providing motion rather than having most of it used up maintaining a static equilibrium holding the weight of the rider.

5111387,0,t1_cv23az6,gtWith these results surely you could get some reasonable level of precision with your test even if you dont get fullon accuracy. Could you not still draw conclusions about which one simulated those particular conditions better than the other?I dont think so. The problem is the discrepancies between each sim and IRL will probably be less than  definitely less than  most of the time and if you start to account for the possible input variations weather etc and their possible influence on the output as well as the robustness of the model small input variations giving small output variations which isnt sure because some of the physical phenomenae simulated can be chaotic... If you want to end up with any kind of statistically meaningful opinion youll be fucked. By the way this is why you should never trust any statistic ever. I can tell you it is SO easy to fuck up a statistical analysis Im a math teacher.Then lets say you can isolate some parameters and be sure that some part of the car is better simulated in X sim but you will have some other part that is better simulated in Y sim. So now you have a problem of order how do you say which sim is the most realistic when each of them has something they do better than another ? This is exactly how every supermarket can claim it is cheaper than every other one theres always a way to order things in your advantage when there are so many things to order.gtMy take on what constitutes realism in a simulation is the most accurate mathematical model to what happens in the real world. Math is the language of science and science is the systematic discovery of how our world works. If one set of mathematical models describes a physical phenomenon more correctly than another it is thereby more accurately simulating the real world.Things are unfortunately not that simple. Since we still dont have a Theory Of Everything and we dont either have computers powerful enough to simulate every particle on the track car and surrounding atmosphere and the interactions between these particles the mathematical models used in simulations are approximations. And even if we could simulate all of that wed still have discrepancies depending on the quality of the data we can input.Now since they are approximations and because they approximate many physical phenomenae there is almost no way to find a single model that is more accurate than the others on every phenomenae. Therefore you end up with a problem of order once again. its like rock paper scissors. rock beats scissors beats paper therefore rock gt scissors gt paper  With a complete order that would mean rock gt paper. however paper beats rock so paper gt rockThats an example of a cyclical order where no element is better than all the others. And thats the kind of things you end up with if you attempt to objectively compare simsEdit unless you can compare every possible measurable thing and I mean EVERY one because if you leave anything out you cant be mathematically sure and you end up with one sim that is more accurate than all the others on EVERY measured quantity... Then youd have a winner.,simracing,cv243oa,8,t5_2quee

5478706,0,t1_cwbw3mi,Given that you are just starting out I would say rfactor  is not the best choice. Given your inexperience you probably wont be able to appreciate how good rfactor  is when it comes to realism especially tire modelling and force feedback. This isnt me being an elitist prick. Someone completely new to simracing will genuinely struggle to find differences between stock car extreme and rf. Also rf is difficult to get into for people who dont have experience with sim racing. For online racing I would suggest assetto corsa and game stock car extreme. Both of those have fairly active leagues and regular club races just use google to find out which league would meet your requirements. I know that many people would say that iracing  has superior online experience and as much as I agree I also think the entry price for a beginner is insane. Yes iracing has some free content and its not bad but I also think that most people dont find free content all that exciting. Especially when half of it is ovals and the other half road racing. If you have interest in both oval and road racing base content for iracing is good. If you only want to focus on one the choice becomes extremely narrow unless you want to sped a lot of cash.,simracing,cwbyf0d,3,t5_2quee

5501368,0,t1_cwes4mw,You need to hit your apexes. It looks like you may be sacrificing your turnin in order to carry a little more speed but in reality youll be able to use the gas more and earlier if youre sliding out from the apex instead of bringing the car back in from the middle of the track. You seemed ok through the Lesmos and Ascari but you need to find a better line through the parabollica. Watch some pro races on the track and youll see how they drive. The straight after parabolica is huge so you are losing a lot of time there.You seem like youre doing just fine with feathering the throttle but Im having trouble seeing your brake modulation. It looks like youre being harsh with it. Are you locking up into the turns? You should work on trail braking so that youre easing off the brake gently as you turnin with the weight over the front of the car then transition the weight from the nose to the side apexing then to the rear accel.Also I noticed on the exit of Ascari you were turning the car to track out at . That means you either entered the turn too slow apexed too early  scrubbed too much speed through the turn or hit the gas too late. Try letting the car drive itself out the the exit the turn. If youre not at the edge of the track thats great  use it as an error margin and keep trying to have more speed on the way out of the turn.,simracing,cweunvx,3,t5_2quee

As a married father of  kids and a guy with a busy job I dont have time to go real racing ironically I now dont have the time to be great at sim racing so I chose sim.I am not the fastest racer out there but I am not the slowest.  I have a gt  irating and I win some league races and am always fighting for the podium. I know more expensive gear doesnt necessarily make for faster laps time in fact I think it does the opposite.  It does definitely make for a more realistic experience and thats what I want from my racing.  When I race no matter the sim I always run with the most realistic settings and assist off.

Why make things more complicated when it doesnt add any value?Plus Im sure you dont really want real realism.

Inside the car a the driver the speed feels good to me in AC if you use the nose of the car view is even more noticeable.Forgot to add In a real car you can also miss the feeling of speed if the road is smooth good tires and propper alignment also the weight of the car play a role in there.

But it seems that it would be better to just get a higher tier card and just replace it when it doesnt suit my needs anymore. I did some research on SLI and what you have said makes sense.

Anyway later you could add in DOF DOF and DOF if there is demand. The motion simulator community really needs someone to offer an inexpensive DOF motion simulator kit for VR.

6878942,0,t1_d0vzd5l,Thats it yes. Le Mans is technically okay not too hard in my opinion obviously like any race track it takes a while to master but that straights could get annoying. The straight on the Nordschleife is in my opinion the minor concern. It is a hell of a job to drive around the Nordschleife while trying to keep up a reasonable speed for a long period of time. Nordschleife is nothing to start with in my opinion.  Spa is in my view really the track to go for. It has a beautiful layout is wonderfully smooth has some challenges like Eau RougeRaidillon and still has acceptable safe zones where you could have sufficient room for mistakes. Bathurst is the contrary. Personally for me even more fun to drive but that has also to do with the thrill of that limited sometimes no at all safe zones. As I mentioned earlier if I were you Id just spent an afternoon with that friend and just try the suggested tracks out and see on which you have most fun and where you see the highest probability to keep the car in one piece.  ,simracing,d0w1iwa,3,t5_2quee

When I came back to the race from the PS overlay menu there was no FFB was present but the wheel was not responding. I tried to disconnect and reconnect the wheel ingame without results and after after rebooting the console it was no longer recognized.  . symptoms I tried to connect the wheel to my PC but Windows reported unknown USB device  device descriptor request failed while the kernel log on Linux showed clearly that the device was not responding when queried for the descriptor. No selfcalibration upon connection no FFB force at all steady green LED upon connection to PC slowly blinking green LED upon connection to PS.  . troubleshooting I tried the official troubleshooting tips and also tried to reflash the firmware in bootloader mode the reflashing worked but no change of behaviour after that wheel not recognized and unknown USB device in Windows.  . solution following some apparently unrelated suggestion on a random forum thread about a wheel not selfcalibrating I tried to connect the wheel to my PC and do a manual calibration rotating the wheel from fully left to fully right and maybe back to fully left. Surprisingly between the first and second try I felt a brief FFB pulse the wheel fan started and Windows detected the wheel after a few seconds.

Im a poor plebby student resulting in my budget for a wheel to be well limited. rFactor  has certain driving aids to make it even playable with just a keyboard and still be fun and challenging for offline play although dont expect to be fast with it online and most leagues wouldnt allow certain aids. There are certain online league racers being successful with gamepads without driving aids although those are the exception rather than the rule. For serious online racing a wheel is recommended although Im not sure how good the T is.gt And should I buy rFactor ? How is the multiplayer experience can I just join a lobby or do I need to download all kinds of mods?rFactor  has the best physics the best AI most complete race rules and netcode has dynamic weather etc. You can just join a lobby and some servers are setup to autodownload mods for you but the best online experience will be when joining a league.

I find that taking it on and off is a bit of a pain and requires a little adjustment each time.The Rift however has a solid strap system that is tightened by springs so its pretty easy to slide on and off.

I know it isnt super sim but I think that the little mini games involved in making your car better are an excellent idea and a nice way to make it a F simulator as opposed to a driving simulator.  And what I mean by that is in F the cars are always improving and changing and by allowing for you to work hard to generate better outcomes for your team is a neat way to pull you into the whole scene.  Also the live formation laps and safety car situations sound like they are going to be interesting.  I hope that somehow Codemasters rolls the live start into the Rallycross in DiRTRally... it is really the only gripe I have about the rallycross in that game... well that and the lack of a funky RWD class.Who knows maybe this will be my first F game.,simracing,d5p14py,10,t5_2quee

The fact their their simulations dont match with expectations or have edge cases that fail doesnt detract from their intent.A game like Grid  that simulates all  wheels but clearly has compromised the physics to get good racing clearly falls into a simcade category.Star Wars is a SciFi movie Star Trek is a SciFi movie.

9528997,0,t3_5bd0jm,I use a controller a lot. The controller settings are actually very well tuned one of the devs made a point of focusing on it at one point. My tip would be to drive with all the assists on to begin with and gradually turn them off and down as you get used to the car and tweak your fine motor control. Smooth inputs are even more important when driving a sim with a controller because a relatively small movement could equate to a rather violent one with a wheelpedals. Youll also never be as quick or as safe with a controller. Ive been using one on and off with AC for years now and Im pretty good at it but I immediately take several seconds off my laptimes when I go from fastest controller lap to first wheel lap. Youll be less safe because you have less intricate control and will either fuck up or run into another car at some point during the course of a few laps its inevitable trust me. That said you can have a very satisfying experience once you get used to it. Remember! the controller inputs are analogue too so dont stab at them!,simracing,d9nneqk,4,t5_2quee

9709006,0,t1_da9qppc,Eh maybe I explained it wrong. Ill try to see if I can find a video about it but it definitely is an actual problem.edit without going through literally tens of hours to find the last video I saw about it I found this explanation on reddit by AbrigantTo help see how  bit allows bigger map sizes imagine you have a cube shaped map  km on all sides. Inside this map you need to know your spaceship location down to cm accuracy. This leaves you with E possible grid location points your spaceship could be at on the map. Now what if you had a map  km on all sides? The number of total locations doesnt just double it increases by a factor of  to E!Now space is a big place and a realistic map could be s km big but for stable game play you still need to know where your ship is at within  cm. Your coordinates need to be calculated using some pretty big numbers which is only possible with  bit calculations.So what I was talking about wasnt just the point of origin but whatever. The quote above is in relation to CIG converting CryEngine from bit to bit to get exponentially better floating point precision to accurately place ships hundreds of kilometeres or even more within a centimeter of accuracy. The same more or less applies to simracing since the accuracy of where it thinks your car is is extremely important for realistic physics and collision detection. With less complex physics you could theoretically have a bigger playing map since the precision wouldnt have to be as good.I suppose there are other factors and I dont know how those huge openworld games work exactly but this is at least what I was talking about. It doesnt take longer to make the calculations well it technically does but nothing you will notice when playing but most game engines limit the map size to avoid the problems which occur the farther and farther out you go.,simracing,da9udps,1,t5_2quee

Your video card is also something that came out recently. When you got this video card did you get the power supply at the same time or was this an upgrade to an already existing PC?

Otherwise youd be sending a horrendous shock through your transmission which in addition to shortening the transmissions lifespan can dangerously unbalance the car.However if done properly going from gt can be beneficial for lowspeed corners that follow from straights and highspeed corners.

10519130,0,t1_dd0182v,Im pretty confident that its only a figure of speech theyve also used the term almost infinite. I might just be optimistic but really I see no reason why they would limit the stage variation. Im not sure how they generate the stages but when I was doing some testing for creating procedural stages for RBR Im a programmer and procedural generation is one of my jams and what I essentially came up with was to generate a terrain with mountains and valleys and then draw the stage track along a slope perpendicular to the downhill direction. It could probably make for some decent stages and the number of possible stages would be near infinite. You can start the stage a few thousand kilometers away in both X and Y direction and you can vary the noise algorithms used to generate the terrain in near infinite ways etc etc. And if they dont do any of that variation the most simple type of variation would be just changing the seed and then you automatically have     possibilities. Obv this is only true if they did things in a nondumb way which Im hoping they didnt. But I have confidence in them theyve been working on this for a while. And making it in a dumb way would be weird it would take extra work to limit themselves. In the end well all have to see in June,simracing,dd0ggsw,1,t5_2quee

11159894,0,t3_5yvza2,Like I always say. The GG is never worth it unless you can even get it at say lt. The reason for this is because it is nothing but a G with the buttons on the wheel instead of the shifter. And yes instead you dont get the shifter buttons as well theyve just moved them to the wheel. Its a G with a DFGT wheel on it without the shifter buttons. Same pedals same sluggish grindy notchy and weak geardriven force feedback.You can probably find a G for  or less which is pretty worth it though. If you want to spend a bit more GG price range and up get a TRS GT Edition. It costs a third more but its ten times better in every aspect. The force feedback is smooth and strong you get  degrees of steering lock a plethora of different wheels to choose from the pedals are way way nicer and more progressive if you get the GT Edition with TPA pedals cant speak for the basic version pedals. I sound like a freaking Thrustmaster salesman but honestly I can not understand how it is not the absolute most popular wheel it is by far the best bangforyourbuck racing wheel and I would even take it over some of the more expensive Fanatec options even if I got to choose from any of them for free. ,simracing,dewyn42,2,t5_2quee
11195578,0,t1_df0sqzx,In iRacing they sure are when streaming with my old setup I had to turn shadows down whenever I encoded with h. which is entirely CPU bound. Just to be sure during my next batch of tests Ill run overclocked and underclocked with and without shadows. If the framerate doesnt really change in the noshadow tests it will absolutely confirm that shadows are CPU heavy. ,simracing,df107a4,2,t5_2quee

11201559,0,t3_5zwva4,The Non LC is very nice quality and has some cool features like being able to take off the mounting plate altogether to moveanglefit the pedals individually any way you like. They also have a lot more travel than the TPA pedals. Obviously the load cell version is stacks better and I wouldnt recommend upgrading from TPAs to the CSL Elite but from standard T pedals you will see a big difference in quality and feel even without the load cell kit.,simracing,df1okx0,6,t5_2quee
11206273,0,t1_dezqu5j,Well I got my  mm wheel and I greatly prefer it. Feels much more like an actual car and not a plastic gokart. Its much easier to control slides. Now I just need to relocate the xbox buttons.,simracing,df27u0d,1,t5_2quee

11518782,0,t1_dg1n6ch,Thanks! Very good to know. The wheel seemed amazing but I was concerned that I couldnt use  ish degree rotation. I wonder why its so much cheaper than every other similar wheel? Just because its old? ,simracing,dg1nlyd,1,t5_2quee

11770230,0,t1_dgu5pog,gtThey may spin out and lose control when trying out a new sim but they wouldnt grossly overshoot a turn like that especially not two laps in a row.and yet it happened...How are you going to tell me that F drivers are the best sim racers when he just plowed off track like a guy that just bought a Ferrari and decided to track it with zero prior training or experience?  Either the guy has next to no sim racing experience or he does and something like the tire choice threw him off I know Ive done similar things when going from Qualifying tires to a harder compound when the game defaults back and I forget to change it.  If he does have sim experience he probably picked that FOV because he likes it and if he doesnt then his lack of experience is what messed him up.  I dont see a legitimate reason theyd have different FOVs if they didnt pick it but one of your claims or the other are false.  No matter how you slice it FOV is far from the issue here.  I could drive with his FOV no problem and that fact alone debunks all of this.,simracing,dgu6qck,1,t5_2quee
11779418,0,t3_680lef,It depends on what sims you have and want to race in. None of the communities and sims will ever give you the same quality of multiplayer competition though.Simracinggp.net have servers where you can hotlap and have a quick race at predefined times with a class and track that is used at the time. They also have saturday and sunday evening leagues and events that you can jump in. They mostly race rF and occcasionally AMS.Simracingsystem is pretty much dead from the beginning as far as Ive seen they can amass around half a dozen players on GT events in assetto corsa everything else has been dead for a long time.ClanAOD had a couple of great AMS leagues but are not running anything at the moment if Im not mistaken.Also if you like Automobilista check out reizas virtual experience portal and the new league finder. People who run leagues will advertise their communities there.,simracing,dgv8gde,1,t5_2quee
