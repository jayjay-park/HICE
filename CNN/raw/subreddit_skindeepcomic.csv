2341542,0,t1_cm141tx,Thats what were led to believe as were dragons. Yet we see Michelle and Bloodcarver so we REALLY havent a clue of what happened beyond what Jims been told.Theres also the detail of the Grim Brothers insisting they hold claim to Michelles soul. That cant not be related here.,skindeepcomic,cm14l3h,1,t5_303jq
2475661,0,t1_cmhmy9b,This is something that I would really like but at the same time  have no use for.I dont know if I should donate or not considering it would reach its goal regardless. ,skindeepcomic,cmhpfji,1,t5_303jq
2498753,0,t3_2o5rku,Sorry. Ive had a busy day. a sort of semitrue story?So Greg just asked if she wanted to go on a hike to a cave or something? Talk about impromptu outings. Oh my gosh is that a black capped chickadee?! How cute! I feel like its difficult to make things look dark noncheesily in a black and white format.I feel pretty bad for Greg though. He seems to be mixing up emotions but perhaps I dont put much confidence in relationships for doing anything much on the level of friendship and such kinds of bonding. At least he has more good friends now through Merial. Maybe he was also just looking for people he could implicitly trust through shared experience to help him with comfort or at least familiarity in the experience which he seems to struggle the most with at least within the context of the comic.,skindeepcomic,cmkq4er,2,t5_303jq

2559460,0,t3_2p1ce3, Jerks! Argh I want Sam to be happy now. At least we see him interacting positively with his brother at some point.To be honest the likelihood of him not having inverted gryphon blood in him is ridiculously low assuming he is genetically his parents child. For him to NOT be a gryphon or whatever would mean that our admittedly limited knowledge of how this stuff works is off.Definitely more saturated. Looks like Kory forgot to apply a brownish filter of some sort. The other pages are kind of sepia. Ahh sad face in panel three! The saddest face! I like to imagine Tim is on an elevator slowly rising to the surface. Or maybe hes levitating himself. Wizards dont need stairs. Waste of magic huh? Wonder what thats about. That Bun in the Oven shirt still cracks me up. Oh Lorne. So hipstery in that second to last panel. They are not interacting well. Cant everyone just be friends. Come to think of it we dont see a lot of Ike interacting with the Lorne Jim whoever side of things outside of this scene do we? Bugbear stare. Oh NOW he looks scared  whatever of Alec. Hmm. Also Lorne is pretty well drawn there. Look at that smile. Not having wing arms seems like it would be so much better. ,skindeepcomic,cmsnq2i,2,t5_303jq

2645282,0,t3_2q8m8y,P Looking back on the older pages and the newer ones here you can REALLY still see signs of improvement. I mean just from Exchanges alone the lines look cleaner and smoother lighting and coloring are more established. Im going to warn you all by saying Ill probably be saying this a lot but gosh this is a well done chapter.P Ivorys somehow given himself  limbs. I guess the skys the limit for the forms the totems take so long as its based on their animal. Also I guess hes been around long enough to have learnt a trick or two about his shapeshifting abilities?P Interesting spirit animalstotems lifespan are tied to their animal. Gotta wonder about how they look upon procreation cause if they have a ton of children youve gotta deal with all these immortal kiddos running around.P Sure Ivory hire the kid with a mental lifespan of  years. That makes sooo much sense. Rickys a cutey.P Help me Obidiah youre my only wait no that doesnt work.P Is Dogwood the dryad?P You can see the Tragos family resemblance actually. And not just cause he and Greg are both satyrs.P Like my scythey looking thingy? Here Obi Ill let you have a closer look.P Man this page gives me the creeps. Heck the entire latter half of this chapter gives me the creeps. I just realized that around this time Michelle Greg Merial and Jim have probably finished freshmen year its May of  afterall or at least on Spring break. Wonder what this means for the next chapter thats supposed to center around Michelle again its been literal years GEEZ?,skindeepcomic,cn3vcwa,1,t5_303jq
