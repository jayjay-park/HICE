4593296,0,t3_3dxg8b,Year   Launch  Make a warrior with friends. Game is everything I wanted loved Warcraft III and Blizzard. Never played an MMO and dove right in. High school and  years old. Shit was cash.Year   Time to Raid!  That warrior wasnt working out. I didnt know that it was doing and had to relearn everything. Macros PvP Keybindings Mechanics. That first year was rough and being unaware of what was out there I reeducated myself and rerolled a Warlock on a PvP server. I got lucky and joined a top end raiding guild that was clearing ZulGurub and half way through Blackwing Lair.Year    The Best or Bust  High school is over on my own. Got Grand Marshal this year and got to the Horseman but PvE was just a way to get better at PvP. CrossServer PvP introduced and couldnt be happierupset. Little did I know the trend of mixed emotions I would feel coming up... everything will be different when the expansion comes out.Year   New Lands  New expansion!  minutes in realize all my Tier  gear is being replaced and my heart dies instantly. I hate all of my work over the past  years is for nothing and I have to start anew. Well at least I can fly now and things are getting better. Arena seems fun might give that a shot.... but gotta get to work now.Year   Repeat  Fucking bullshit I saved up  months of DKP for the Ashes of Alar mount and the GM gets first dibs!?!? And when I bitch about it I fucking get kicked?! Fuck this man I passed on so much gear I needed just to be the st to have that damn mount.... at least I got my Gladiator mount. Well my girlfriend didnt understand why I was so upset that day she has begun to watch me play more and more. Lets see what the new expansion has to offer....Year   Where are you?  Ive been playing this new expansion for fucking ever and no Arthus. The reason I wanted to play this game in the first place was to enjoy the idea of wielding Frostmorne just once! My girlfriend is pregnant and has picked up WoW too so thats nice. She is learning fast and loves mounts like me but Im sure shell get bored eventually.Year   There and back again  I quit. No Lich King Im gonna sell my account how hard can it be... Ill just put an ad on craigslist and see how much people will offe.... !?!? SOLD! Totally buy a new crib for the baby and maybe a wedding ring..... wait Lich King announced?! Fuck... better buy a new account...Year   I didnt ask for this  My wife is fully in this game and I have given up. Nothing is challenging anymore all that is once new is gone and the flavor is getting sour. I enjoy watching my wife play though Ill stick around for her.Year   Are you even trying?  I now sell paid Grand Marshal runs to fund my wifes mount addiction. She wants to get all of them so bad so I help how I can. I noticed I play on her account a lot more and more than my own..... HOLY SHIT BABE STOP BUYING THE TCG BOOSTERS!Year   Lost lands  My account is gone but I still play on the wifes account. She loves pet battles and enjoys mounts so I get all the hard ones that she doesnt know how to grind. Ill let her do the drop ones and Ill say something like Back in the day it took us  guys to do this. or something. She enjoys it so I cant complain.Year   Full circle  I still help when I can and what not. New expansion out now and shes digging the whole new systems. I think its so watered down that ill never go back but what ever.... is that my daughter doing the pet battles?,notcirclejerk,ct9kthx,4,t5_2u3ct
