61044,0,t1_celbaqb,Just checked and it works as intended.     But now I have another issue. Out of my  DVDs only  show up. And these  are the ones I have already watched with this xbmc setup.    Now I know what you may think. I have a filter that only shows watched movies but that is not the case.    The problem seems to be that only these  files have a resolution information available. Which is why they can now show up in the playlist.    I guess this is because xbmc only gets this information once you playback a file? That irks me a little. Isnt there a way to scan all files to get this info? It would really be not ideal if I had to now manually start all  movies just. Its doable but cumbersome.    I thought when I scraped the movies to get the artwork etc that things like resolution info etc would also be collected but that seems not to be the case... Really weird is that my added HD Movies which I have not yet watched all show up in my HD Movie playlist and all have their resolution info available! So for some reason the scraper could collect this info for the Blu Ray rips but for my DVDs it seems xbmc cannot collect this info?    Really weird.,xbmc,celdp1u,2,t5_2qhno

405862,0,t3_1yqdd4,Your question doesnt really make sense. Its kinda like saying I was told I could use a car to get to Texas how do I do that? Movies on the TV is the end result but there are a lot of steps in between.Essentially you need to do the following Plug your USB hard drive into your router   Configure your router to mount the hard drive as a networkconnected share   Connect to the new share on your Macbook   Install XBMC on your Macbook   Plug your Macbook into your TV with an HDMI cable   Add the network share to XBMC as a media source   Set content type of media source as TVmovies as appropriate and scan to library optional but recommended   Browse your files and play a video  If youre using your Macbook as the device you probably also want to set up some kind of remote control mechanism too. Common methods are wireless micekeyboards infrared remote controls and smartphone apps.You havent indicated which step you got up to. Youve kind of implied that you just plugged the hard drive into your router fired up XBMC and hoped for the best in which case youve only done steps  and  and still have a lot of work to do.,xbmc,cfmu147,9,t5_2qhno

798805,0,t1_cgv0vkw,So now that you mentioned Refresh channels on next start it makes sense. I deleted BBC channel  made a Simpsons channel ... but I never told it to refresh. It would still play BBC but say its Simpsons. Settings.xml would have Simpsons in it and nothing about streaming BBC thats why it was strange to me. Ill have to remember to Refresh the channels when I do things like that.The NAS thing is strange. Like I said after many config changes and reinstalls this started to happen. However when I AltTab into windows and go there its instant. Ill uninstall and clean everything up so this may not be an issue at all.Right now Im messing around with everything to see what I can do to see what I would want to setup. This setup is not going to run on my PC for one thing. FireTV is the most likely platform.I can interleave  different channels and bumpers. I was able to add a Bill Nye The Science Guy channel from YouTube. Vevo worked once but then it would not load but I was adding and removing channels massively so I may have needed to Refresh the channels.Next thing to try is to interleave a YouTube channel Cosmos with Carl Sagan fromt the s with the new one with Neil deGrasse Tyson and add a Science Fiction bumper. I still havent figured out how to set bumpers per channel type. I have the bumpers media sources set to the main folder. When I use it it just plays any random bumper. e.g. Simpson gt National Geographic Bumper gt Family Guy... Thx for all of your help. When Im done with my setup Ill post the Settings.xml so that everyone can use it.,xbmc,cgv2sa0,1,t5_2qhno

1570728,0,t1_cjd2ifl,Weird.  For example I use this case for my htpcI have  intake fans zero exhaust fans only my gpu gtx helps because I mounted my psu to grab outside air.  On the bottom in the front of the case I have  zalman hydraulic fans and on the side I have  cougar vortex fans.  I would have all cougar vortex but they were not smooth when mounted horizontally.  On the back on the case if you look at it the air is pushed out really hard where I could mount mm fans and in the empty pci slots.  If I tied a ribbon back there it would probably fly with the wind   I also have in the bios asus high performance to run the fans faster than normal.   Hydro fans are so quiet though.  The idea is to get cool air from the front and blast it out the back.  I know this is overkill but i like my stuff cold.  Ive never had a single component fail not even an hdd Im  in my life so Im going to continue my overkill   Maybe you thought I also installed intake fans even the back.  If so my bad.  Yeah that would cause problems.  On my gaming pc I do have an exhaust fan by the cpu heatsink in the back but i have  intake near the front.I dint know maybe it doesnt work for everyone but stuff runs cooler this way.

It is not truly devastating seeing how this is decided.I understand it is hard because preparations need to be made before the name is announced. But having  options and letting the community vote for them would have reduced a lot of the outcry. Especially if the explanation is that there was no other choice.I am not saying most people hate the name.

2129633,0,t1_claicve,I wouldnt say it is polluting the XBMC world since it was not created for the XBMC world.  I agree it is definitely a rehash of what seems to be a market that has plenty of allinone media center solutions.  I created a NUC for XBMC and that has to be the best experience so far but the price and configuration was far beyond the potential for ease of use and cost vs performance.  The Amazon Fire TV has ethernet but the Wifi works perfectly fine for streaming high bitrate files.  Even a raspberry pi can get by with reasonable media quality for its components.  We should be happy we have all these reasonably priced high performing devices to choose from.  Would be nice to have the best of all worlds without a doubt.  I think the the Amazon Fire TV hardware with a more open environment like this could provide at a  price range would be wonderful.,xbmc,claiuch,3,t5_2qhno

For me and mine though every day functionality needs to be with a reliable and long battery life IR remote. I count it as the single biggest factor in turning it from a geeky pc that plays movies and stuff to a bog standard appliance that plays movies and stuff. As always with xbmc there is a bit of config work but it isnt hard and once you do that bit you have the knowledge to extend the functionality pretty easily. For example I mapped the clear button to close zsnes and drop me back to xbmc. It just makes the whole experience more friendly.,xbmc,cloknrw,2,t5_2qhno

2412630,0,t3_2n0v9l,If you manage to achieve root use this XBMC apk  It contains several very useful utilities for the FTV. It sleeps right in XBMC using a custom screensaver that emulates the android locksleep button even though the FTV doesnt physically have one. Also it overrides the stock launcher and makes the home button go to XBMC. You can sideload it with adbfire which I mention in the last paragraph. If you dont root Id still use that apk because it has good keymaps for the remote and you can change them within XBMC using his utility. Also it comes with shortcuts you can add to the homescreen so that you can just use Netflix and other android apps right in XBMC. When youre done watching Netflix you just press back and XBMC is right where you left it. It would be silly to switch to your PS or Roku. Another thing if you dont root look up the program adbfire. Its one of the easiest tools to use anyway so you should probably get this first to sideload the XBMC apk. But what I wanted to say in this paragraph is that you can use adbfires Llama preset to spoof an app icon on your home menu to launch XBMC. The default is an app called ikonoTV. Go on your computer and find ikonoTV on the Amazon app store and have it pushed to your FTV. Then after it installs use the Llama feature in adbfire to change the icon to XBMC and to launch XBMC. Now you have this XBMC shortcut on your homescreen which is useful because launching side loaded apps normally required you going kinda deep into the settings menu. ,xbmc,cm9wryi,3,t5_2qhno

I generally use usenet and download most of my own content along with what I buy. so I dont even worry about most of the addons for myself. Im really trying to simplify a set up for a friend who just wants content with ease. Ive found youtube content to be the most painless of the bunch just because it rarely ever buffers in XBMC. I sold my buddy on an android box and all he does is complain about the buffering on these addons. I have trouble shot him to death and it always comes down to the certain file hosts he has issues with and while I have changed the host priorities in the settings he always comes back bitching about the buffering. I just figured while the youtube links may die quicker there are less issues streaming for him. ,xbmc,cmiiebe,2,t5_2qhno

What are these people going to do when their streams stop working? Some people will be able to fix it themselves others will ask someone but the majority of people will just go eh and move on.And I couldnt care less if the streams work or not but the people buying these boxes some upwards of  are going to be asking the retailer for answers when they stop working. Do you think the retailer is going to stick around and help?,xbmc,d00filv,3,t5_2qhno
6744682,0,t1_d0g017c,Backing up data is making copies of that data on the current install.  Trying OpenELEC is installing the Kodidistro OpenELEC. It is by far the best option for a quick solution of installing Kodi. Since your Zotac Zbox Bluray uses an Intel board with an Intel ATOM CPU it means that you can use the Generic Builds downloads.,xbmc,d0gygqm,2,t5_2qhno

7185050,0,t1_d1ure3f,If I recall correctly the Cast Whole Screen is still highly experimental and isnt ideal for some computers. Personally I had tested this while I still owned a Chromecast mind you on a gaming PC which resulted in most media like movies ghosting. I no longer own one so who knows maybe they fixed it this with either later iterations of the Chromecast or just in general but at the time it just wasnt ideal for me. Alternatively you can push an Android device to cast to the Chromecast but I really dont know much about it and I would have to guess that it would either drain the battery faster than usual or it might not work for everyone if this is their first time setting everything up or theyve got little knowledge with the Android OS as a whole.I usually recommend things like the Shield TV or an Android Box to people because their setup is akin to a normal Windows installation of Kodi due to the simplistic nature of going onto the Play Store installing the .APK file and setting it up much like you would on a Windows or Mac. Personally I own the Shield TV and while it can be a pricier device it is worth the investment in my eyes especially since I use it for both its own instance of Kodi and the gaming features like NVIDIA GameStream so I dont always need to run back and forth between my bedroom and my living room. Are there easier solutions? Yes but this is just my personal recommendation as Ive had no issues with it.,xbmc,d1uvlpu,2,t5_2qhno

8184647,0,t3_4rd9e3,IMHO the answer is a combination of the two listed. I used one to tag songs then the other to organize messed up directory structure.

11458097,0,t1_dfuqgzl,Not the case. Certain subtitle formats are set to appear at certain timestamps. Others match frames in the video. The file size has nothing to do with those.  This is why when browsing for subtitle files you will see many releases of different size listed as compatible with a single subtitle file.When working with plain text subrip files my favorite because of small size and ease of editing the time offset and frame rate of the video are the most important influences. Edit I should also mention that in the world of computing file size is nowhere even remotely close to unique for each video file.  Not even md is unique. You are better off using sha hashes. They take a little time to generate but the certainty is unparalleled ,xbmc,dfurmvy,1,t5_2qhno
