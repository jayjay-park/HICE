9279287,0,t3_55dch0,Ive had the same issue here as well. Talking to my gf and my mom in separate chat threads. Sometimes its super quick but sometimes I get single grayed out check mark. Tried turning off wifi where I get full LTE. Or even going back on WiFi or closing the app. Nothing changes until it decides to send it. Already happened a few times where I just end up using hangouts to get the message across. ,GoogleAllo,d8s7swe,1,t5_3eo1k

11522223,0,t1_deey484,Can confirm an overwhelming majority of my friends use Apple so iMessage and almost all of the rest use Samsung I believe Message is the default which is the Verizon SMS app. I think most Android phones come with Messages installed but it is not the default on all carriersmanufacturers. The reason I like using SMS is because when I message someone from Hangouts it sends it to them from my phone number. Allo sends it from a xxxxx number and then proceeds to say Ginger hey Ginger how are you doing? Ginger want to hang out later?I am not the kind of person who likes to separate things too much. I would rather have one app that I can message text call and video from. I dont see why I need four apps to do all of that. To get the functionality of Hangouts I now need Messages Allo Duo and Phone or Google Voice for people with GV numbers. ,GoogleAllo,dg21nrc,1,t5_3eo1k
