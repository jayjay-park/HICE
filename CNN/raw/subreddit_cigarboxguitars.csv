638826,0,t3_21ffi3,There are a lot of builders that build strings and even more strings.  Try cigar box nation or homemade music clubhouse.  Some people make really amazing instruments.Ive built string instruments without a truss rod but theyre very short scale  more like mandolin sized.  Truss rods are not hard to add but they do increase the price of the build if you buy them ready made from somewhere like StewartMacDonald...  I think the main reason that people build the typical  or  string often fretless instruments is that theyre not musicians and they like the idea of being able to play really easy stuff mostly slide and power chords with nearly no learning curve.  Thats not to say that you cant play more challenging stuff on a  string or  string instrument.  Just that they do lend themselves to the sort of supereasy rootsy distorted slide stuff that you find all over YouTube when you search for CBGs.  ,cigarboxguitars,cgcvvn1,1,t5_2xffk

7934641,0,t1_d47o83t,Yeah I get you. I wouldnt do it again. If you have more patience than I do and the necessary tools for the job Im sure it could turn out really great. But nails are a lot more uneven than they look and I think it would take a LOT of finetuning to get them lined up right.As far as actual fretwire goes I dont think I did it properly by any means. I just measured it out used a coping saw to make the grooves cut the wire into smaller strips and hammered the suckers in with a rubber mallet. Then I strung it up and tried every string on every fret. When I heard buzzing I spread the strings out with my fingers and banged a little bit on the next fret if you notice s buzz on fret three hit fret four with the mallet and it seemed to work.,cigarboxguitars,d47xfhu,1,t5_2xffk
