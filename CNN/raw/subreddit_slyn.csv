2528705,0,t3_2nh2oi,Ok I appreciate your answer.So its normal not to be able to defeat the dragon straigthforward. One need to go downstairs and get XP and stuff then go back uopstairs to slain the dragon. Am I right?,slyn,cmomz3f,1,t5_31xdg

Its my weapon of choice for then unless I find an Ogresmasher along the way,slyn,cr2n1hy,1,t5_31xdg
