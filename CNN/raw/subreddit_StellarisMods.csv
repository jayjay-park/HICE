7506265,0,t3_4i5eah,I dont know how you could roleplay this. But an eventchain involving the Timelords could work I think. ,StellarisMods,d2vf9p9,2,t5_3de64

7635542,0,t3_4jsh9m,Yea looks like some of the nobrainer mods to basic UI etc.. are making their way into the core game. Good to see that the dev is agile enough to do so.,StellarisMods,d3a4a5f,1,t5_3de64

8114639,0,t3_4qb8wt,It is absolutely possible.I made a private mod like this about a month ago and ive been playing with it ever since. A space pirate empire with only female rulers they are a bunch of cyberpunkstyle humans from one of the experimental colony ships just like the Commonwealth of Man. Basically i got a dynasty of badass cyberpunk pirate queens DBut its a bit tricky. You cant simply tell the game to not pick any male heirs or in your case no more female heirs. It will always randomly pick a male or female character for the next heirruler. But its possible to tell the game which portraits it should use for your rulers. And your rulers have an extra name section in the name list.Maybe you can already guess where this is going. What you have to do is you basically have to fake a patriarchymatriarchy by making the game use only male or only female portraits of your species for its rulers.But the portraits are just the first step. All your rulers would now look like males but there would sometimes still be female names among your rulers because we are simply faking the whole thing the game is still picking male and female rulers its just not noticable anymore if it wasnt for the names....So here comes the second step. You make your own name list and in that file you make the lists for regnalfirstnamesmale and regnalfirstnamesfemale look the same in your case only male first names for both lists.Oh right i almost forgot there is still the ruler title of course. Since patch . we are able to edit the ruler title so you also have to adjust that so that both the female and male ruler title are the same if you dont you would sometimes still get rulers like Empress Marcus Augustus lol. You can do that really simple in the custom empire creaton or you if you make a prescripted empire then you just add rulertitleEmperor and heirtitleCrown Prince to the ruler section in the prescripted country file. It will be used for both genders.Yes i know how weird this workaround sounds like. But it works without a single flaw all rulers will look like they have the same gender as you can see here on these screenshots. I used the console command killruler a few times to show how it works. Only female rulers. Although technically some of them are probably male characters but since all the names and portraits are female you cant see any difference anymore.And yes this solution is ruleronly not like the Matriarchy mod that completely removes male characters. As you can see here i still have male scientists governors generals and admirals  If this whole thing about portraits and name lists was a bit confusing to you then you maybe want to check out this thread from last month. This is where i discussed this problem with some guys and found the solution i mentioned here And if you are still confused afterwards then you should check some tutorials on making a species mod and portrait mod first. Its not really that difficult you just need to know what you are doing which file goes where and so on. Download some portrait mods and just take a look at how they work thats how i learned it.Unfortunately i cant just upload my mod to the steam workshop for you to take a look at it because im using waaay too many  or  portraits from artwork sites like deviantart stuff like blade runner fanart shadow run cyber punk stuff like deus ex and so on the mod contains stuff from about ten different artists and if i upload it it would probably be taken down in a matter of minutes and i would be in trouble. That guy with the Asari mod already had trouble because of one portrait and i use almost  artworks i dont own so it will unfortunately have to remain a private mod.,StellarisMods,d4s5qdj,2,t5_3de64
8193385,0,t3_4rhrjm,Probably something about deleting mods that you arent subscribed to. Go to the files properties and set the readonly attribute and the launcher will work right.,StellarisMods,d51q3q4,1,t5_3de64
8384602,0,t3_4ud8r2,Did you create the mod from the launcher? You should have created the mod from the launcher so it shows up next time you start stellaris then you put your changes inside the created folder.,StellarisMods,d5pmgob,1,t5_3de64

8930766,0,t1_d7lccud,farmingworld modifier is not a planet modifier. Its just a boost to happiness that agrarian pops get if theyre on a designated farming planet.Before I share files just checking something.,StellarisMods,d7lch7u,1,t5_3de64
9607418,0,t3_5cjn45,Just the csv. I think the ods is just there so that it is easier for you to see and understand it. I use a modified version of the ods to do the edits then copy it over into the csv file.Btw just a suggestion try changing torps to close range with high damage and a low cd time to spice things up.,StellarisMods,d9xb76s,1,t5_3de64
10805929,0,t1_ddugx0v,Your best bet in my opinion to download a mod that adds some portraits to the game and modify them! Im still learning it myself and thats what Im doing. Are pretty basic mods that as far as I know just add portraits. Theyre humanoid but with some tweaks you can probably swap them with other models.,StellarisMods,dduk0d2,1,t5_3de64
10961096,0,t1_deajdm4,I can make the tags for planet sections more spaced out instead of clumped all together. That may help a lot ?,StellarisMods,deak5j3,1,t5_3de64
11401750,0,t1_dfod509,Why not just change the component file instead? You just want to change how they work right? Or the defines and direct it to another tech instead.,StellarisMods,dfodhba,1,t5_3de64
11518084,0,t1_dg1kfxx,I cant think of any stand out names just stuff like Barrage Core and Artillery Core and similar. Titan Slayer seems like it could be an interesting reference to those who understand it and that actually fits Stellaris a lot better. As for the crystal it was a pretty easy deduction lol. There were no reactors in your design and there was a side component that Ive never seen before. It makes sense. ,StellarisMods,dg1kre1,2,t5_3de64
