188680,0,t1_cez2gms,So right now Im looking to spend about  on some powered monitors. I see some used bxs for . yamaha hs for . But I was doing some searching around about Is there such thing as speakers that are too large for a small room. I found something you said.gtIt is more about what wattagevolume makes your particular speakers sound their best. HUGE speakers may not hit their potential without some higher volumes db  the drivers and in a big room that is OK because you are far enough away that it is listenable and not super loud. But in a small room....Same with small speakers. They might sound their best at moderate volume and putting them in a huge room means you push them harder and they are overdriven.My room is x untreated wooden floors. Im thinking Might as well get bxs. But do you think it would be better if I just get some  powered monitors instead?Heres what my room looks like. Excuse the feet shot.Whats your recommendation here? Theyre going to be replacing my bxas mounted on there as theyre starting to go bad on me.,Zeos,cezxhuo,1,t5_2txbr

4590570,0,t3_2wnwor,Hi Zeos.  Quick question  Looking to do a very simple . setup with a Sony XBRXB long story short  Realized i dont have a genuine need for . and am trying to keep it simple.    My current plan is to go toslink to a SMSL Q to a Dayton Audio SUB to a pair of WaveCrest HVLs.    I was also considering the NXG Bas but i dont know if that is overkill for this setup.  Do you see anything wrong with this setup?  Mostly movies TV and a lot of music.  The room is a bit awkward from an ideal sound perspective  sq foot living area with  foot ceilings and the TV is  feet from the sectional but im planning to put the speakers very close to the listening area both would be around  feet from the middle seats and both at around  feet height.  Woofer behind the sectional.      My priority is clarity of sound and bringing everything close to the listeners.  I currently have zero external speakers so anything is an upgrade at this point but i do want quality audio.   I live in metro philadelphia and when whether allows i open the windows  in the living area which lets in a lot of din so i dont want to have to compete with that.  My solution was to bring everything in and avoid the audio getting lost to the room.  Are these speakers OK for close proximity?  Thanks for putting together this resource!  Ive been reading for awhile and just started watching reviews.  This is incredible home audio can be really overwhelming for a rookie like me.    EDIT  By the way i saw in your review of the SMSL Q that you were curious about the  on the display... i read on the Q product page that there is Impedance adaptation of  ohm... is it possible that there was ohm switching going on?  Does that even make sense?  Anyway thanks in advance for any info.,Zeos,ct98jhf,1,t5_2txbr

The pads do most of the work.Thanks again Zeos for the review it was money very well spent!

You dont have to worry about overpowering as you can adjust the levels of all speakers individually on the receiver so it sounds balanced.Im still waiting on my pair of UBs. I ordered them in April. They should be here by the end of the month. If you want to do the center alone as the new UB series feel free. I dont think it will hurt anything as far as timbre goes. Two subs usually perform better than one. But I would just get one decent sub and position it correctly first.

In all reality it is usually easier and certainly cheaper to just find a way to run speaker wire  around door frames or through the basementfloorwallsceiling to get them where they need to be then install an additional amplifier and do the same thing  adding a power adapter to the wall that has to be dealt with. ,Zeos,d8gth3u,2,t5_2txbr

9683705,0,t3_4yd60f,I noticed the most expensive amp you have on here is a receiver and since you dont seem to normally cover receivers this got me wondering what do you generally think of them? Do you think a  stereo receiver stacks up to  in separates?,Zeos,da6pz8l,1,t5_2txbr
9734723,0,t3_5e62tu,Whats the deal with AMPs and DACs getting warm?Is that an universal thing that just gets worse linearly to the more power the unit has or what?Frankly thats what kills the Schiit stack sex appeal to me.,Zeos,dad0m6k,1,t5_2txbr

9945436,0,t1_dah417j,It can be but Im using it as a DACAmp Headphone  Speaker.  Not sure why it would be left out as it compares well with those included on merits.  And you were giddy enough about it in your review that I bought one. ,Zeos,db3wydx,1,t5_2txbr
10029465,0,t3_5b1u99,Hi Zeos Im a complete noob who wants to set up a system in my x living room. What do you think of the Wavecrest speakers with the Klipsch R center and ELAC  subwith the Denon . receiver? I figure the Klipsch center can compensate where the Wavecrest speakers fail on the highs but then again I dont know anything about sound systems. Any other recommendations? Also what order would you recommend getting the speakers in? Sides then center then sub? Thank you for all this!,Zeos,dbev81e,1,t5_2txbr

10746562,0,t1_ddm0h1p,TASCAMs will be beaten by the Mx in all catagories. Not as much bass as the tascam but better quality. The HM are more neutral than they are and the s are neutral but have a more upfront sound. If you cant mod the pads on the x the s would be my next pick.,Zeos,ddofcne,2,t5_2txbr
11178457,0,t1_dexjtwz,X are great for soundstage and low end. If you want more balance the new M should be  but are out of stock everywhere so they are jacked up right now. Id wait. Get those when it comes down.,Zeos,dez2df7,1,t5_2txbr
