On the reds i used to have i wouldnt bottom out much because its a light press and my entire question was revolving around possibly making the key travel shorter but the wording was odd because I couldnt find the right words.

The HHKB is the best board I have ever owned for my needs and comfort with what I do. If the sound and feel of the MX Blues is something you enjoy than I would recommend MX Greens as they are a bit of a twist on the Blue switch. If you are interested in mixing it up the Topre boards and really something different in terms of feel when typing.

631938,0,t3_21dvn9,No experience with the crazy Razer custom switches but it appears the silent one is just quieter. Should feel the same. Id check out reviews people probably have the answer. Also would you consider looking around at other keyboards? rmechanicalkeyboards hates Razer for a ton of reasons. If you want a gaming keyboard Id recommend really any keyless or full size board with Cherry Red Switches. Theyre linear so you can push down just above the actuation point and rapidly actuate the key. Useful for WASD movement. Check out WASDKeyboards models Das Keyboard Filco Cooler Master Storm or Ducky if you want something flashy.

735943,0,t1_cgnuopk,Clears have a weird stock springs as the bottoming out weight is much higher than the actuation weight cN vs. cN. This design is intentional as the larger bump on the switch stem necessitates a stronger spring to ensure that it doesnt get stuck below the actuation point. From that you can infer that having nonlubed ergo clears would result in stuck keys more often than not. I also recommend that you sticker your switches as that would reduce the vibrations when pressing down on the keys and result in a much more satisfying actuation. ,MechanicalKeyboards,cgnxibo,0,t5_2ugo7

850398,0,t3_23srfm,You probably are better at touch typing then you think. With you being able to type WPM looking down is just a habit. You are probably not looking down to find a key but more for your own comfort. If you get a chance to play around on a blank keyboard you will understand. You will probably type faster because you are not distracted by the different letters but you will still find yourself looking down. Breaking that habit is the tough part and will take time. Just in case here is a link to one of our blogs that has a few tips that could help you type faster. Hint there is more involved then just looking down.Hope this helps.,MechanicalKeyboards,ch0y0jc,2,t5_2ugo7

857712,0,t3_23y9fc,So I have a Leopold FCM with brown switches. It felt drastically different than my Das with blues other than just the click. The Leopold keys when bottoming out give a deeper thud where the Das w blues at bottoming out not the click give a higher pitched clack. The Leopold keys just feel better too.   I attributed it to the PBT keycaps on the Leopold. I had a chance to poke at a Corsair G w browns at Best Buy a couple weeks ago and it pretty much confirmed it. It felt a lot more like my Das than my Leopold. So my question... Is there are any other major difference between my Leopold and these other keyboards that could be a factor in the differences or am I correct in my thought that its the PBT keycaps? I ask because if its only the keycaps Im probably gonna try to find some PBTs for my Das as well.   ,MechanicalKeyboards,ch1rz6b,1,t5_2ugo7

870945,0,t3_243afg,Someone already mentioned ergo clears but heres my . for what its worth. I personally hate blues and browns were my favorite switch second to reds before trying ergo clears so my opinion may not be that useful since you seem to feel kind of the opposite. Also indeed greens would feel way too heavy for you if you disliked the weight of blacks.Not sure if you are up for doing an ergo mod but it may be worth considering if you are leaning towards the CODE with clears. I generally smash any and all switches right the way down bottoming out like crazy but with the ergo clears I dont not sure why I just naturally didnt do it right from the start of using the board and they are definitely my favorite MX switch to type on. I dont find them fatiguing at all whereas I personally find blues quite fatiguing. I think thats because of the artificial click and the bump being very pronounced compared to the much longer tactile bump with no click found on the clears. My clears have g Korean springs compared to the g on the regular ergo mod using brownbluered springs  If you did want to look into doing an ergo clear mod with the CODE it may be worth looking into the g springs combo as I have heard sometimes the slightly lighter springs usually used can lead to keys sticking. ,MechanicalKeyboards,ch3a48k,2,t5_2ugo7

1073892,0,t3_26er0i,If you have nail file it is easy to score grooves on the edges of keycaps. If you use a consistent coding system for scoring the grooves each key will have its own unique identifying groove.  Then it is just a matter of using the keyboard and feeling for the groove to determine which key it is.While you are learning it is best to keep the grooves clean with a microfibre cloth because over time dead skin cells nasal pickings and other stuff can fill in the grooves making it hard to feel the codes without decoding error.If you dont want to use a nail file you can try a hot needle to embed dimples in the surface of the keys.

Costair stabilizers dont have this issue but they have their own problems rattling squeaking that can easily be fixed with lube.Id say most keyboards use cherry stabilizers unfortunately and usually the mod isnt so difficult this board is just an exceptional pain in the ass. Ive already voided my warranty but if youre comfortable sending it back Id recommend a Filco. Theyre well made and use Costair stabilizers.

1086292,0,t3_26g52h,I use a TK with browns myself and I love it.First of all good choice of color brown switches are the best IMO.For me the layout of the TK is awesome. I like the narrow keyboard for gaming more comfortable with the mouse closer I use the arrow keys all the time and I use spreadsheets for some ontheside accounting so I need a numpad.The build quality seems good to me Ive used it since november and its working great. I broke a keystem so my esckey now has a Cherry MX Blue from my old keyboard but thats hardly the keyboards fault P Opening the keyboard to change the broken switch was easy.The connector for the removable USBcable is sunk in to the underside with cableguides for the cable. This means that it is virtually impossible to break the connector when the keyboard is in use. The QuickFire XT has the connector externally but Im not sure about the Rapid.Thats my opinion I hope it helps.,MechanicalKeyboards,chrri8s,1,t5_2ugo7

1108889,0,t1_chuamyv,Mechanical keys actuate a switch by mechanical motion.  Rubber Dome keys actuate a PCB signal via electrostatic.The main benefits are that the spring in a mechanical switch assists your fingers in returning to the top of a keystroke and saving your muscles from working to pull them back up.  This heavily reduces wrist and hand strain and in my case has completely eliminated any pain from long duration use.You can tell youre using mechanical because the switches will feel crisp springy and...well...expensive.   In the case of Blue or Green Cherry switches you will get an audible click from the switch due to a plastic clicker inside that actuates off the leaf spring that holds the key at rest.  Brown and Clear and White keys are Tactile only which means youll feel the leaf spring actuate the key but theres no click switch.  So your tactile is the little bump when the switch passes the leaf and actuates.Red and Black switches in the Cherry family are linear.  Which means they are not  engaged against a leaf they merely rest at the top of their stroke.  When you press a linear key it will feel most like a rubber dome of all of them but still extremely different.  Its a smooth even press that is great for doubletap or quick actions but not so desirable for typing as the actuation from the other colors of keys often provides useful feedback to your fingers.You can tell its rubber dome if it feels like typing on mashed potatoes.  Literally once youve tried MX Blues or Greens or Browns or Buckling Springs or ALPS switches you cannot help but notice Rubber Dome.  Rubber Dome switches feel like cheap crap.I dont know enough about Topre keys to get deeply into them.    There are a bunch of sweet animations of Cherry switches actuating so you can see what Im describing but I just got a call and dont have time to grab them.  Hope this helps.,MechanicalKeyboards,chuc72d,10,t5_2ugo7

1247842,0,t3_28dwt0,Check out some of the info in the sidebar and read up on different switch types keyboards budgets etc. Id also recommend either going to a store with some mechanical keyboards on display sometimes Best Buy has one or two out might be able to open a box up at Microcenter whatever borrow one from a friend or grab a switch tester online. Thatll help you decide what sort of switch you do or dont want.And speaking of switches Id recommend against just taking someones word for it. People always say that Cherry MX Blues are for typists RedsBlacks are for gamers Browns are a middle ground for gamingtyping etc. What you need to do is find out which switch type you prefer for the way you gametype since none of them is objectively better than another.Once you manage to decide on a switch type its time to figure out what size keyboard youre after. Full size tenkeyless   Ergodox DIY or something else? Consider your usage do you actually use your number pad? do you have RSItendonitis and need something really ergonomic? the space you have available and your budget. Dont worry there are plenty more decisions to make after this.What additional features do you want? USB hub audio ports backlighting what color? adjustable brightness? DIP switches certain stabilizer types for new keycaps macro keys and all kinds of other things.This isnt about the keyboard itself but you might need new accessories to go along with this new keyboard like a new wristrest different keycaps or who knows what else.If you can narrow some of that down more itll be easier for people here to help you out.,MechanicalKeyboards,ci9zxid,5,t5_2ugo7

Easiest way to fix this problem would be to go to SignaturePlastics look through their inventory and buy  colored DSA profile .x keys. If you want buy a few extra .x keys and make a RGBY modifier set. It may look better than a single colored key on an otherwise Dolch layout.Standard spacebar size is .x. While the  uses the same size the stem spacing is weird. To alleviate this problem buy a Keycool  spacebar.

Its not a group to woe upon the days which could of been better spent with a peripheral worth naming. Instead its a support group for those of us who shudder at the mere mention of the name razor. Those of us whom experience Vietnam flashbacks when some hipster slings out the words Dude youre gettin a Dell dude. A Group where we learn to instead of shun belittle and insult those that have not experienced or refuse to experience the pure bliss that is capacitive switches we instead talk about all the great and positi....circle jerk each other off until satisfied while collectively hive minding our lovehate relationship with KK Factory. Then to end each meeting  member gets voted as the most passiveaggressive which normally always ends up being the guy talking about ducky LEDs. To close out the meetings said member changes the position of  keycap on an IBM springboard from its current QWERTY layout over too DVORAK position. Envy you envy me envyless a bubble board be.  I tried its too hard i understand they are people too...however its already been statistically proven GWAM for GWAM that a user who finds their perfect MX Switch color or upgrades straight to capacitive will gross  and even higher words a minute with  as many spelling and grammar errors. I understand the price range is a leap for some however that seems to more or less be an excuse being taken advantage of mostly by those whom are sitting on  Mechboards. Welp friend if you would instead stop your Indiana Jones wallet adventure on trying to find the perfect cherry switch for you instead you could just jump on board too the switch that suits everyone. Oh they dont have a bunch of flashy LEDs you say? Go to walmart buy one of those cheap rotating black multicolored balls stick it on your keyboard tray then snort enough MDMA to make you terminally color blind. Problem solved. After spending  hours the other day doing a deep cleaning to my realforce even my deck legend ice with mx clearswith LEDs so bright it could call batman and board built so solid it could be used as a professional baseball bat is collecting dust. All because i finally achieved realization and took the dive into a capacitive board and its like experiencing and achieving all  goals of Buddhisms Nirvana all at once. Enlightenment that there really is something this perfect and life changing. Liberation You transcend beyond the goods and evils of keyboard peripherals. As there is no negatives to needlessly argue and debate over and it has become pointless to convert those that start all their sentences with the word but. Wisdomrevelation That with capacitive its future can only get better and better. Sadly those that refuse or have yet to have the opportunity to start their nirvana first need to zen themselves into realization first and move past the tunnel visioned ideology Blah blah blah BUT Ill stick to what i know is tried and true.TLDR Bubbleboarders amp scissor switchers are people in our tribe as well however...while their still worshiping the invention of the cheap wheel all caveman can afford.

Getting programmable buttons and a USB hub at that price is going to be difficult and by difficult I mean its not going to happen.Coolermaster TK is one option but if you want to customize your keycaps take note that it has a nonstandard bottom row keycap layout so if you buy a set of keycaps the bottom row ones wont fit.If you want full size from Coolermaster theres  options. Trigger Quickfire ultimate Quickfire Pro and Quickfire XT.The CM Storm Trigger has backlights and macro keys and its probably the most likely to be outside of your price range as a result.The QF Ultimate has backlighting no media keys.The QF Pro has backlighting on only a few keys around the WASD cluster.The Quickfire XT has no backlighting but it has a few tricks up its sleeve. Firstly its got more modest styling which I consider a plus secondly it comes it a wide range of switches including MX Green switches and its probably more likely you can get it in the switch you want in your region. Thirdly its made by Costar the makers of the Filco brand. That means quality is basically assured.All the CM boards come with media keys accessed via the Fn key.Ducky do some great quality boards too. Id recommend looking into the Ducky Zero Shine boards but the issue is getting them in your region without shipping costs that break the bank.Corsair K series boards certainly do the job and tick the boxes if you like their styling but they come with a nonstandard bottom row again so beware if you want to buy keycap sets.I doubt youll see a Das board in your price range.Then theres always the trusty model M which may be available for the right price feels great for typing has a numpad and everything but no backlight media keys macros no NKRO not great for gaming and as for aestetics...,MechanicalKeyboards,cjc1jl8,3,t5_2ugo7

1586096,0,t1_cjf2wc1,Dont worry Im kinda new to the mech stuff too. Ive been getting into it over the last three months and I learned a lot here. Feel free to message me anytime or even post stuff here. About your question  of the keycaps there is are made out of ABS or PBT. ABS and PBT are abbreviations for the chemicals they use on the plastic of the keycaps. People claim that PBT has better quality since its more solid and has a better grip on the fingertips. Also printing on PBT keycaps apparently seems to last longer than on ABS. The ABS keycaps tend to get shiny and the legends usually wear off after heavy usage. But they are also very good stuff dont be afraid to get a nice ABS set if you think it looks good. It will last for a decent amount of time. Also the PBT keycaps usually are thicker then ABS. Thats responsible for the solid feel and people love the sound they make. Another kind of keycaps is the Doubleshots. Those are incredible as well their legends will never fade out because of how they are made the legends actually are a piece of plastic with the letters format and that goes inside the keycapcase. They are really good to type on and are the closest you will get to a vintage keyboard from the s. Try to look on the sidebar wiki so you can understand a little bit better. About the process there are a few ones. Laser engraved doubleshots pad printed. As I said the doubleshots are the best option they will last until the word ends. DSA you mentioned is a keycap profile it is lower than the SA profile and its also based on the vintage keyboards. On this  link you can learn about the keycaps profile I mentioned. Here you can find all the info there is about the infamous Dolch set that had another round last week. The Granite set from what I know was based on the old school Olivetti keyset and the Windows  era. Heres the original group buy thread for it that ended some time ago.

Just enough keys to provide a large amount of function but not enough extra stuff to make it feel bulky and redundant.. . So small and compact yet so functional! I love this formfactor but I sometimes get peeved with entering large key combos etc.. Ergo ergodox microsoft comfort keyboard etc. I hate this formfactor.

1828410,0,t1_ck9b58k,Its really hard to describe. I like light switches and I do my gaming and typing on reds. However I recently had a chance to try a stock unmodded unlubed clear board and I actually liked it because actuating the switches wasnt nearly as hard as I thought it would be.The force diagrams are misleading in my opinion. They make the springs seem really stiff but theyre not linear. In other words getting past the actuation point to me feels only a little bit harder than what Id need to apply to bottom out a blue. However the spring on the clear switch stiffens up considerably towards the bottom of its travel. The end result is that I end up actuating the switch but never applying enough force to bottom out. It feels almost like a finger trampoline and in the end I dont feel any more fatigued than I would typing on a blue.If youre the sort of person that absolutely needs to bottom out every keystroke in order to feelhear the key clunking I can absolutely see why clears would tire you out. It takes a lot of force to hit bottom. If you like to hover type stock clears might do the trick for you.I need more time with them but clears are definitely growing on me. ,MechanicalKeyboards,ck9ikjl,6,t5_2ugo7

Theyre fun to have but as other have pointed out the clickyness of them is quite noticable.  I skype with my friends while gaming and they would constantly complain about my crazy loud keys when I had the blues.  Also I can be quite a key spammer when I play so that didnt make it any better.When I switched to browns it took me about a week to get used to them but now I love them.  My buds say the keyboard isnt nearly as audible as my old one but they can still hear it when I go into key spam mode.  Id like to try mx clears next in fact Im thinking of taking my old blackwidow ultimate and turning it into a custom project.I think having mx blues is something you should try out at least once but if noise is a concern then getting browns or even clears if you want more tactile bump is preferable.

2052435,0,t1_cl0p5r1,The main maker of keyboard switches is Cherry Corp and their main switches nowadays are named Cherry MX with a crossshape switch stem. Cherry Mx stems are generally compatible with Cherry Mx keycaps the right size. Kailh is a Cherry clone made after the Cherry patent expired. Personally I dont like the feel compared to genuine Cherry switches. Its also questionable how reliable they are because theyve only been out in the market for a few years. I believe theyre cheaper than Cherry Corp switches and theyre easier to obtain so some companies are switching to Kailh so theyre not impacted as much with Cherry Mx switch shortages. ABS is the common plastic used in making keyboard keys particularly the backlightcompatible ones. Its also the one used in Lego. However it does feel slightly oily and sticky as your finger typing polishes away at the plastics pretty easily making a shine.PBT is a much harder to use plastic but its far harder wearing and its rough like sandpaper not smooth like ABS. PBT is higher quality material and few companies use it because its expensive. It also shrinks when it cools so you get warping of key sides if your keycap mould or conditions isnt good enough. If you check my other post reply grab a SA profile keycap for your extra key  its  for one key grab a PBT one if you can  but theyve only got limited colours and shipping from Signature Plastics is cheap. Obviously buying a whole blank keycap set is stupidly expensive this way but for small orders its fine.If you take a look at this album by uuns you can see the enormous difference on the keyboard the SA profile keycap is on a board of DSA which is that right key in the picture with the  keycaps. Its nowhere near as dramatic on normal keyboards but itll certainly stick up by about mm. ,MechanicalKeyboards,cl0pkis,2,t5_2ugo7
2053529,0,t1_cl0uh3v,BrownsClears and RedsBlacks will be quieter but it really depends on your preference for the feel and how you type and what you use it for. I cant really say more than to just try out some keyboards if you can in those switches different keyboards may sometimes feel  and sound different due to construction keycaps etc. If you cant do that try a switch tester to try and see what you like. Also Orings make a big difference in the feel and sound of a keyboard even Blues I recall someone tested the sound levels and there was a noticeable difference. Personally I find browns really nice reds and blacks with too little feedback and Im still waiting for my Code TKL with Clears. Blues when I had a chance to type on them for a bit felt pretty good and easy to adjust to. Orings make the switches feel different again. My G with Orings doesnt feel very tactile unless im hovering above the actuation and tap it casual browsing use and feels shallow when Im typing with a slight give at the bottom of the keystroke. My QFR with Browns no Orings feels like its a bit springier at the bottom as if the key is helping me bounce off and its a bit louder but does feel more satisfying to type on. Maxkeyboards has a good key switch tester with basic .mm A Orings for you to test on but unfortunately theyve just recently run out of stock. Some places online may have some left though. ,MechanicalKeyboards,cl0uki0,1,t5_2ugo7

It should be labled ATXT or something like that. Youll want AT. BTW they sold on taobao for around   NiB here,MechanicalKeyboards,cl5n8w5,4,t5_2ugo7

2101247,0,t1_cl6vz5h,Hobbies can get that way. You can pay  for a gaming rig plus the price of games that can play most anything on low settings or you can pay  for a good computer or more for an even better rig. You can also pay up to  on a computer thats complete overkill. In Magic the Gathering you can pay  and get yourself a preconstructed deck to play with friends. You can pay  and get a pretty good deck that beats all your friends or you can pay  for a tournamentlevel deck and even more if you start playing vintage. Its the same with keyboards. You can pay  and get a cheap Rosewill keyboard that works just fine. You can also go and get a really nice  keyboard. You can also spend  on a really rare keyboard that youve been ogling for months and will likely not come back up for sale for a very long time. You can also go complete overkill and pay  for an Industrial Model M because its a different color. Its literally the same as a normal  Model M but its green.This stuff can get crazy. Its just one of many expensive hobbies.,MechanicalKeyboards,cl6wxg0,15,t5_2ugo7

Ill never knock Razer for their switches until evidence comes out that says theyre bad but there are many more parts of their product that I disagree with so I dont often recommend them.

I use them on the browns and the board feels better. On my Poker with clears I had installed them but it doesnt matter much.But if speed is relevant games? getting the things to bottom out exactly at actuation point could be interesting. In which case you may experiment with using two orings or even three? depending on thickness. This would make the key stop right away.There isnt really a consensus on this. All is personal preferences and for what you use the board.Also it depends on how much you type how exact you are how heavystrong your fingers are and maybe a few more things.This is basically nothing you can ask other people but find out for yourself and it may even be different for different boards you use.

2256950,0,t3_2l1xqg,Some background to the guide Ive been hearing about how thick PBT has issues with wire stabilisers for a while with keys getting stuck when pressed down or an unpleasant grinding as you pressed down. But I could only find one old image about this issue this old Geekhack image and some Geekhackreddit threads. I had been using my QFR with the PBT DSA but found out they werent good with the Orings bought from ebay  . mm clear ones for  AUD I had and it led to some very unpleasant sensations in my fingers if I used it to muffle tapping it up to the top also led to uneven bottomingout differences  it did almost nothing if settled at the top of the keycap. So I ordered the Ducky WhitePink engraved set because I know crossbars help with the bottomingout feeling with Orings. Then I discovered the thick PBT grinding issue for myself and it made me hate typing on my keyboard. For a few days until I sourced the sandpaper I had to endure the terrible sensation of grinding keycaps. I havent included any photos of sanding the keycaps because I was wetsanding it I really didnt want to breathe plastic dust and was periodically dunking both the sandpaper and keycap into a container of water. I used the same  grit sandpaper for all of them after I didnt see any effect using  grit sandpaper  I couldnt use big movements and was hard to get a good pressure on the sandpaper.

I was to busy playing around with itplease recollect Ron Swanson or House typing gifs to post anything before now. Story I somehow wore my rubberdome keyboard down so everytime my fingers came close to the c button my keyboard would spam it. Vim being my editor of choice happily changed lines like the wind. Then I decided to buy a used Cherry G. I love that board. Like it has brought me so much joy. And people at my school too! People stop whatever they are doing and look at me with a If I didnt envy you so much I would be happy for you squint in their eyes. And my new board! I finally understand all them teenage girls because I cant I cant even.Technical I used the DIP swithces to put ESC as a mainlots of vim and control instead of scroll locklots of screen sessions and tmux and vim. I didnt however use the DIP for the commandmac key and alt because somehow the manufacture thinks if you set up the left side to be like a mac keyboard you shouldnt care about the right side. This is a picture for reference Luckily I could switch the alt and the command keys in keyboard preferences gt modifier keys. But they even just sent a single command keycap  If someone here has a spare command key that they dont want please let me know!

2341758,0,t3_2m5lsb,Like the other poster said there is no definitive switch for gaming or typing. Each person has their own preference. I would say that there is really no difference in typing  as both are fun to type on. Although for gaming I do prefer browns over blues. It is not that blues are bad for gaming but rather I like the lightness of browns.As for browns vs blue which is better is up to you. Blues offer a nice tactile and audible feed back for typing and knowing when you actuate a key when gaming. Browns on the other hand are a little more quiet depending on how you type. The browns are also lighter. However there really is not a tactile feel on browns in my opinion. If you press the key down slowly to feel for the bump sure its there. But if you are typing at  WPM and pressing keys in rapid succession while gaming... I doubt youll feel anything. For a stronger tactile bump like the browns I would suggest looking into clears... but that is a different discussion.,MechanicalKeyboards,cm15jm4,3,t5_2ugo7

2400891,0,t1_cm8cm6c,I have a Poker II with clears and a Ducky Shine   Leopold FCM this with browns. The switches are similar both tactile and nonclicky but the clears have a more defined tactile bump and are harder to actuate. When I first got the Poker with clears my fingers got fatigued from the actuation force but I like the feedback. I definitely type faster on browns but it might have to do somewhat with keycaps too. If you dont mind pressing your keys a little harder you should try the clears. Most people prefer ergo clears because they use the stem of a clear for the larger tactile bump but they use the softer springs from a brown. I havent tried them though.,MechanicalKeyboards,cm8gipb,1,t5_2ugo7

2440433,0,t3_2ng86c,The biggest benefit of mechanical is being able to buy according to your preferences of how it feels to type on not just how it looks. For normal common keyboards youve got scissor switch and rubber dome. You cant choose how stiff they are and rubber domes tend to get stiffer over use  unevenly over the keyboard too. Scissor switches have low travel too which I find tiring. For a mechanical You can choose whether you want it to click or have a tactile bump or neither of those and be totally linear.  You can choose how heavy you want the switches to be  do you want it light like mx reds or heavy like mx greens?  You can choose different keycaps for it  do you want longlasting and textured pbt or do you want cheapergrippier abs? What colour do you want with it? Or even better what custom keycap set catches your eye?  You can choose if you want backlighting for your legends not just an underglow on your keys.  You can choose the layout  full? Tkl? ? ? Or a custom layout? Or one that you create yourself?Its that choice and the customisation that brought me to mechanical keyboards. And its why I love to type on mine so much. ,MechanicalKeyboards,cmdccnp,1,t5_2ugo7

It increases corrosion and wear resistance and during the process the anodized aluminum surface can be dyed into many different colors.Usually for projects like this you purchase aluminum pellets and melt them down or recycle cans then pour the molten aluminum into the mold.

Since Im not doing dev on a game my plan is going to have to be a program running in the background watching keystrokes to make changes.  As someone who has done work on the SDK is there any better way of handling this?The best thought I had was a way to give the Gaming Software and exe that it would feed keystrokes to or something like that.Also if I ever make that game I want to make the one that every SE has in the back of their head I will totally be adding this though.,MechanicalKeyboards,cmno44l,1,t5_2ugo7

Few enjoy the nd hand sound you produce.  I love them for typing but for gaming they drive me nuts in FPS with the wasd cluster movements especially. RTS they are great. Clears are an amazing typing switch. Once you learn to not bottom out they are a pleasure to type on since they will be very silent too with great tactile feedback. For gaming they are miserable for all genres I found. I started off with browns and found them to be scratchy reds so i ditched but im actually going back now because there is just something about them. They make a nice little snikt sound while typing and they are nice and light for gaming. I only really prefer reds and topre for gaming for I cant stand them for typing.  Browns youll barely be able to tell the bump but if you try other switches and come back youll notice it more. Ergo clears i felt the tactile bump was too harsh with lighter  springs even when lubed.  Honestly out of all them if I lived alone I would choose blues actually ergowhites but thats not an easy option for mostbut im very much happy with browns. EDIT also since clears are heavy they are nice and soft EDIT  youll be hard pressed to find a full keyboard with all the bells and whistle in whites unless you mod another board,MechanicalKeyboards,cn3p1c7,1,t5_2ugo7

2671899,0,t1_cmsxw21,Just in case anyone is interested this keyboard definitely does not use costar stabilizers... I dont know what they are. In theory it looks like you could replace the stabilizer clips with costar clips and then use costar stabilizer springs. In my case I didnt order the clips from WASD and dont want to spend the shipping to just buy them. I didnt realize at first that I could remove the stabilizer clips and in doing so all of the u.u.u keycaps no longer get stuck. So minus the spacebar Im able to use my Galaxy set but Im definitely investing in a new keyboard asap. Heres everything thats wrong with this Thermaltake . Nonstandard R key spacing. Nonstandard Capslock stem placement too far to the left. Nonstandard but potentially replaceable stabilizers assuming the costart clips fit. Spacebar seems to be a lost cause  nonstandard size u wrong stabilizers and wrong stabilizer placement for use with a standard u spacebar assuming Signature Plastics make standard u spacebars.I know that Thermaltake has moved on to Kaihl switches so they may have changed their layoutstabilizers as well but Im staying away from their keyboards from here on out.,MechanicalKeyboards,cn7c92a,1,t5_2ugo7

2742878,0,t3_2rf5p5,First look up switches decide which one you want. Both companies offer most of their products in a variety of switches. Even if the vendor youre looking at doesnt happen to have them in stock ATM. For gaming it doesnt really matter which switches you pick but lighter actuation force like reds lends itself to games where you have to spam like RTS games. While things with high actuation force like blacks lend themselves to FPS where youre waiting for animations to finish. But its much more about preference than anything. The blue click switches are what I and many people use. And they are good typing switches as well as good for gaming because of their light action force. Although the tactile bump can made it difficult to double tap as efficiently as you would with a linear switch like a black or a red. Clears arent generally considered a gaming switch but if you have heavy hands you certainly could. And browns are just blues without the click. If youre in the US wasd will be much more reasonably priced. If youre not then the filco might be a wash. People say build quality is better but in reality there is no noticeable difference between a TKL filco and a TKL CM rapidfireJust lower quality controllers from the same place and the filco has  extra screws. And the obvious of terrible branding on that CM model. But if youre in the states youre talking about a board thats less than half the price and functions almost identically. ,MechanicalKeyboards,cnfuqty,1,t5_2ugo7

2794829,0,t3_2s37uj,Gimmie a sec. Workin through em.first album First one looks like an IBM EMR second is probably a DEC LK third is a wyse pce fourth is a compaq enhanced with an interesting set of capacitive foil caps from keytronics. fifth is some kind of model m one of the infinite variants of the IBM Enhanced keyboard Im sure. sixth is another IBM EMR same with the seventh IBM EMR eighth is an IBM PC AT ninth looks like an apple MA I think. Second album most of these are the same obviously. I think they are made by NMB and they could either be rubberdome or space invader keys. The one that is missing keys is not space invader however so Im mostly certain these are all slider on rubberdome design. Cant find anything on AST so far. probably rebranded. the other two Im gonna say slider on dome. cant read the company name though. the stem looks like a smk cherry mx mount but the back isnt right. at this point im  certain its rubberdome. Third albumtheres a few that i cant identify from top pics alone. ill leave them blank for now  second is obviously a KeyTronic  evidently part of the keytronic model f clone family. uses their foam and foil instead of bucking springs. third is some random ISO rubberdome PC Term. never heard of em and cant find anything. cool lookin though cant read the name on the fifth  seventh looks like an Epson QA th looks like a model f but its not labeled and is probably the saddest yellowest one Ive ever seen. I want to buy it and restore it   tenth is the same as the th from album  an apple MA aka the macintosh plus keyboard Update Ive about used up my knowledge base here so if anyone can double check and fill in the gaps Id appreciate it.

2818449,0,t1_cnislcc,Its not hard at all. I relied on the guides here Really its just a matter of wiring up the diodes into the rows and then plain bus wiring the columns. The rows are self evident for the most part but when you get to the columns it can seem confusing for example which column is the space bar switch in? It actually doesnt really matter which column you put it into. Once you wire it all up assuming no shorts or cold solder joints you just enter the correct values in the tmk firmware to identify which column the spacebar ended up in and youre good to go. Thats just an example but its really dead simple. I recommend reviewing the links in the page linked to above.

2893060,0,t3_2t8pn3,There are a couple of places for motion on a Cherry MX switch. The first is the stem of the switch causing a bit of wobble in the base of the housing with the spring and the second is the top of the switch case moving against the bottom half. The second type of wobble can be reduced by stickering but the wobble of the stem assembly cant be modified much. If youre interested in switches that dont really move around in the same way then you should look at Topre and Buckling Spring. ,MechanicalKeyboards,cnwy0wt,1,t5_2ugo7

As a software engineer computer keyboards will always be a part of my profession so why not become experienced and educated in all the nuances of this control surface?  Its not as expensive as building a new rig and you can always have use for a few extra boards lying around plus I can give them to my brothers as handmedowns if I find myself with too many or not using them.

3237564,0,t3_2x6ldl,Dont have any tips but Ill share my experience.I learned Dvorak a while back and got to about wpm or so but I found that my right pinkie and ring finger would get agitated after a lot of typing so then I started to learn Colemak.  In my opinion Colemak is the superior configuration and I would like to have kept on using it.  Switching between multiple computers at work and school made me revert back to QWERTY strict IT policies at work.  On the plus side switching between those configurations and back again made me learn to type QWERTY more properly so even though Im back to the primitive form my typing has improved.  Also its not a struggle when I hop on someone elses computer.  About the S placement issue the Poker II or any other programmable keyboard if they exist would be great for that.

I eventually came to the decision to get the Novatouch TKL but hadnt pulled the trigger or anything like that. I came home today to this sitting on my desk under my current keyboard. My lovely wife had purchased the Novatouch for me taking my k RGB in the process. When I bought the k in November my wife was quite clear that we werent spending a lot of money on more keyboards because a  keyboard was more than anyone needed and she thought it was silly to begin with. Now she has realized that mechanical keyboards are amazing and really enjoys the MX reds in the k. That keyboard is going to be used with her computer now and I get this awesome Novatouch.

This would explain why single LEDs are blowing rather than groups. To be honest this is the most likely scenario. Cheap resistors.Alternatively if they are driving multiple LEDs in parallel from a single resistor there can be cascading failure issues due to discrepencies between diodes but I doubt this is the case.,MechanicalKeyboards,cqpg4hq,24,t5_2ugo7

4199400,0,t1_crywmbn,I can understand that. My brother is a lot like that. What will you be using this keyboard for? I would recommend Topre as Im a huge fan of the g switches which are a bit harder to come by than the g and although I like both I only love the g switches. I am hesitant to recommend it thought if you dont already have a Cherry or Cherry alternative that you love as youll probably think it feels too close to your current keyboard. That goes into my next point. A lot of these keyboards are about the nuances of them. If you want a near perfect typing experience type on an old IBM Model M or Model F. Cherry switches definitely feel different than rubber domes but with any switch Topre included you need to give them time to learn their nuances to fully appreciate them. Minds are not usually blown right at first. Use a mechanical with the switch that feels best to you for a few weeks then go back to your rubber dome. You should definitely tell a difference then. Immediate satisfaction does not always happen though I am aware many of your issues with the WASD werent with just the feel. One final thing to be partially aware of is that the community surrounding your simple mechanical keyboard is vast and wonderful. Getting in on a great group buy finding a custom keycap set that fits you or your work environment perfectly or even designing products for the community is a huge part of the hobby and overall experience for sure.,MechanicalKeyboards,cryxchv,2,t5_2ugo7

4346551,0,t3_3askgf,Quite a few boards have MX Blacks  more so than Clears or Greens. They are more popular over on GH than on rmk but you dont tend to see them much here  similar to MX Greens. I think a lot of people get threatened by the extra pressureforce that they require over Reds and opt for the lighter option instead.Vintage Blacks are one of the most highly sought after switches and you often see people will harvest them from old boards. Gateron Blacks are gaining popularity amongst enthusiasts as they are often cited as being much smoother than MX Blacks.,MechanicalKeyboards,csfl70w,2,t5_2ugo7
4346862,0,t3_3askgf,As Im sure youre aware these are just heavier reds. They are great for LowAPM gaming think FPS but are very tiring for general typing.

4354146,0,t1_csg4z3b,Yup just overall quality and attention to detail. A lot of gaming keyboards have a lot of flash to lure in people but really tend to skimp on the details. The Kailh switches bad keycaps bad quality control just makes the product unreliable. Razers arent inherently bad out of the box but they do seem to have issues lasting. I dont see any reason investing  in a keyboard that wont last either. Ducky has a lot of flash in the Shine series due to the lights but they use real Cherry switches have much better keycaps removable cable and dont have that horribly intrusive software that Razer uses. Just an all around better product. ,MechanicalKeyboards,csgg14c,1,t5_2ugo7
4354324,0,t3_3atkzt,I only owned  razer product and that is my  razer mamba that I intensely used for gaming for the past  years.

I have no plans of getting a new mice yet til this one dies but I will most likely gonna get a different brand unless I find a  razer mamba on the market. ,MechanicalKeyboards,csggr3p,1,t5_2ugo7

4521958,0,t3_3czytb,It depends on the particular implementation.The Fn key is usually a modifier i.e. your  thus you have to hold it to access the other layer. Thats the default on HHKB Poker and most other keyboards. Its the same behavior as on laptops actually.However some keyboards e.g. AEKII have lock switches on some keys such as Caps Lock. If you press a key it stays physically pressed until you press it again. A similar toggle behavior i.e. your  can be implemented in firmwaresoftware too thats the way Num Lock or Caps Lock already work.Then theres the third option a dualrole key. The key is a modifier but if you quickly tap or double it it toggles the layer until you press the key again.If you decide to use a keyboard with a custom controller such as something ATmegabased e.g. Teensy or a replacement for Costar keyboards you can run the TMK or Easy AVR USB firmware and configure any key to any of the listed options.,MechanicalKeyboards,ct0mtfn,1,t5_2ugo7

4829333,0,t1_cu39s93,As someone who owns all of the above most of the time I actually prefer the Novatouch.

4829563,0,t1_cu31yda,Its goodish but better than anything i have ever used.For just typing its really great the columnar layout really make a difference.I own a few mechanical keyboards i have split keyboards where always looking for something more ergonomic but the split just isnt that important the fact that the keys are in a straight columns matters much more. the khali? brown switches feel amazing. Surprisingly it feels better than original Cherry MX browns. The feel is very close the ALPS black only lighter.The number keys are a bit weird since they pretty much have an off by one error there is an extra key before the numbers on the top row. On this model the backspace is not easily reachable with thumb so i mapped it to the left space much better the tab is in a bit of awkward position im thinking on putting it where the backspace used to be. By default the insert is only reachable with the fn they IMO this was a dumb move anyway i mapped it to the top right backspace. There are a few things that needs tweaking but overall its really good.The only other thing i would consider is something like an ergodox but im not sure since for me it needs to be portable and an ergodox seems less portable than this. Also you really cant buy Ergodox especially in the EU and i dont really have time to make one myself.What  i would change is that i would put  or  more buttons as thumb keys under the two space bars.,MechanicalKeyboards,cu3b1fx,1,t5_2ugo7

Its pretty easy to find places that sell keyboards in ANSI like the Keyboard Co and the keycaps are easier to find whether you ship them over or not. I recently bought a Novatouch and had the choice to get it in ISO for a tenner cheaper or pay the extra tenner to get the ANSI layout and I am so glad that I did. Just waiting for the Tai Hao group buy to come in and it will be complete. Also getting used to it took me literally an hour the longer enter and shift are just easier to get to and to me it just feels so much easier to type on ANSI rather than ISO.,MechanicalKeyboards,cu8rvwd,1,t5_2ugo7

5007388,0,t1_cupgs3q,So sadly this is the only picture of the wiring I have available at the moment this is obviously without the LED and microcontroller. The rest of the casing is made out of mm thick transparent acrylic with the mounting and backplate being made out of aluminium. The acrylic was lasercut to size including all the holes for the bolts and then sandblasted so to make it semi translucent. So what youre basically doing is making an acrylicaluminium sandwich held together by the bolts. I also completely insulated both aluminium panels with insulationtape to prevent any shortcircuiting. The shine on the top layer of the acrylic is created by only sandblasting the bottom and sides while leaving the protective plastic on the top part until youre done sandblasting it.The keycaps were purchased from here but be advised that I had to get a replacement for the rightshift because the set does not include one the right size. I made the blank keys at the bottom by just taking numpad keycaps and sanding them down with special plastic sanding paper. made by a Japanese company called tamiyaSorry about the crappy picture but I hope this was useful nonetheless.,MechanicalKeyboards,cupkuv4,1,t5_2ugo7

I tried that using AutoHotkey several weeks ago and it works well.Considering your injury I would have thought that making one of the space bars a Fn key would be more convenient than reaching for your Fn key.

Frosting comes from tiny tiny scratches in the acrylic and so you have to progressively knock down the high points to get a smoother surface. Its not that hard to do for something like those waterblocks since theyre flat but with the acrylic case you may have trouble sanding the inside especially if theres a lip. Check rwatercooling. There ought to be another guide over there and you could even ask questions. I think its worth doing though because youd have a really unique case in the end.,MechanicalKeyboards,cv7jezs,1,t5_2ugo7

5449980,0,t1_cw896px,Ah sorry.  I want some more quieter switches maybe brown? No rubber dome  and No linears. I do need function keys. Any standard common layout will do besides the one with that big enter key.  LEDs would be nice because I mostly do things at night but they are DEFINITELY  not a must. Ive coped fine with no LEDs on cheap walmart keyboards  just fine for years.Basically an all around quieter beautiful  keyboard that still gives me a satisfying key press.  I can be heavy handed on the keyboard.  I find that my current setup causes strain all over and isnt comfortable. ,MechanicalKeyboards,cw8acuc,1,t5_2ugo7

She calls back a day later upset because the laptop was damaging her aura and she wanted a refund. We informed her we do have a return policy for full refunds if there is a mechanical fault with it. She threw a bitch fit. A few weeks later she calls back again saying its defective because its slow. We check the laptop in and find numerous viruses including beachboys.exe. We tell her she has downloaded viruses and its not a defect and offer to wipe the laptop for her with a discounted servicing fee.She then goes on a slandering campaign on Facebook about how awful our company is and how we sell bad equipment and nobody should ever buy from us again. She told everyone we refused to replace the laptop because the vibrations of the hard drive were hurting her wrists  absolutely nothing about how it was damaging her aura or the viruses she downloaded. We took screenshots of EVERYTHING  email conversations virus scans etc and posted it on to every post she made about us but in a very professional manner. She has become the laughing stock of out town. After typing this out I think I might just post the full story to talesfromretail because theres a lot I left out and its just plain ridiculous.Edit I was actually kidding about the post but I think I will do it.

Personally I like Blacks quite a bit typing on my Cherry GLPMUS as we speak and I can say with certainty that the RCg is no where near as strenuous. Its more so chalked up to the difference in Cherry vs. Cup Rubbers design than just the listed respective actuations.These MX Blacks resist your keypresses from depress to bottom out versus with capacitive once you get past the actuation the dome collapses and you have little to no resistance until you hit the pillowlike bottom out.

5594103,0,t3_3rnvxl,lt the snowcap one! Some feedback would be to make the keycap in different colours for different tastes with the snow the same colour of courseI know Id dig it in black  the white top like a snow capped mountainPerhaps add some more slight character to it without the minute details taking a lot of time  light sprinkle of glitter perhaps to make it shine a little and look into making the drips a little more snow like and making it a little more consistent in colour.Second favourite is the island  my only gripe would be the small details like the mouth  you will need to find a way to make it look much cleaner if you want more traction with thoseTiki is my least favourite but its because I dont like tikis that much P Cap quality looks good in fact I think if I didnt dislike tikis it would be my favourite because of how clean you have made it.

5750940,0,t3_3twk0h,Im not sure why no one ever mentions this but if you spam super fast and youre not super heavy handed you wont get the same speed as if you had a cherry mx. Its quite possible you can play casual games or games that dont require a spamming action key but Im a league of legends player myself and its impossible to play with topre without feeling sluggish. Same probably goes for RTS.For whether you can handle the layout.. You just have to be honest with yourself based on the keys that are missing. For general use do you resent the fact you will have to press altfn or fn for f and f respectively? And I also know the f keys have their place with certain mobarts games but that depends on whether you use them in particular for the games you play. The issue isnt that home end scroll lock or the arrow keys require an additional key press. Honestly they can be learned and its quite satisfying if you did buy the hhkb for the reduced size. Its certain combinations that used to be one hand and now theyre two.So bottom line if you dont have to do any time sensitive spamming action and you dont mind doing f differently then the hhkb will be amazing. If you find that you use the missing keys like home end pg up pg down way more than you estimated you might be in for a gamble. The reason why I use it is because its a great keyboard to type on with vim which is a editor that provides a multitude of shortcuts to navigate text without the home end arrow keys etc.P.S. Not to scare you but there is a dip switch to make the left meta key act as fn. So altf can be one hand by using the thumb to hit alt and meta at once but then youll have to resort to the right meta key which was tough for me so I turned that off.P.P.S. You can look at the pokr or the v for other  options with cherry mx switches. I havent found the perfect gamingtyping keyboard but it youre willing to pay top dollar you can always make a custom board with zealios switches. Its something Ive been eyeing but Im holding off on the keyboard splurg for now ,MechanicalKeyboards,cx9yjum,0,t5_2ugo7

The keycaps are pretty runofthemill though so I wouldnt consider that a downside exactly. ,MechanicalKeyboards,cxm3jea,1,t5_2ugo7

Here is a bold prediction This market will explode the moment one of the midlevel keyboard manufacturers releases a keyboard with an artisan escape key already included.

When they are pushed together itll help make a friction fit.B apply very thin coats of clear nail polish to the inside of the stem.

6000576,0,t1_cy660rr,Which taboao agent did you use?  Engtaobao?How did you figure out which switch was the browns?When you do get the RGB keyboard please post back with some of the RGB capabilities.  Namely like how many brightness levels it has per color whether you can get more intermediate brightness levels by holding down the RGB color level key then releasing instead of just tapping it   once and so on.  Example the ducky shine  has  levels of brightness per color if you tap thus xx colors but If you hold down then release you can get  levels per color .  I was only able to get  sub levels between off and level  but assuming the same pattern applies to each level that should be x per color.Someone with the EElement RGB keyboard said that holding down is the same as tapping and doesnt work on the Eelement and the Eelement RGB only has  levels per color xx total colors..  Would be nice to see if the Vod Ray allows more.Let us know how long it takes to arrive you can make a new thread or PM me because the way the Shine  MX blues are going I might want a Vod Ray RGB CIY before that.,MechanicalKeyboards,cy67fea,1,t5_2ugo7

6191438,0,t1_cyt9z4e,I see. My idea was to make use of poker cases available in different designs and material. I guessed that it might need a new case design overall.How about a sandwich design in highprofile where the first layer covers the corner then plate layer then frame then bottom layer.Or a D printed case made of two or three parts clipped or something together.I think something like these wont cost as much as steel right?What if the top section of the case is the main large one instead of the bottom one and the access is from the back not the front. Like a one unit top case then the plate and PCB then one sheet as the bottom.Sorry if Im saying nonsense.

6204836,0,t1_cyuvgb4,I would say the shine . It has a hint of higher quality. I think it really comes down to the loudness of the switches. I like my switches loud but the KBT ones are just a little too loud incredibly subjective. As long as you can find a good set of keycaps that you like I think either would be great.

6239727,0,t1_cyyscq0,Money leaks is a good way to think about it. I think I do a decent job of this as it is since I bring tea or coffee from home usually and generally eat at home. Sometimes Ill treat myself to a sandwich or a meal out but Im always conscious that its exactly that  a treat the nice things in life become less nice when overused anyways. I basically do walk everywhere since I dont have a car. When I am driven its the  miles to classes and stuff. The closest real grocery store to my house is like  miles away. Ive been thinking of getting a credit card and a checking account early so I could build credit while Im young. The things I buy regularly could go on that card and I could get an early start. Thanks for all the financial advice Ill definitely keep this all in mind from now on! XDRight the Snowball definitely seems to be favoured as an entry level mic. My brother got one  I was surprised by how big it was I thought it was half the size  and he seems to like it. Personally I would probably spend the little extra and get a Yeti or something for the different options but thats just me.

6242550,0,t3_412myl,Hey!  I have a Ducky Shine  and I absolutely love it.  If you want replacement keycaps keep in mind that most of them do not have transparent legends I looked all over for these recently so your LEDs would not shine through most caps like with the stock ones only around the sides.I bought these because I wanted some white ones and they were the only ones I could find that were readily available and had translucent legends.  They look and feel awesome.  PBT is apparently higher quality plastic and it shows.  They have this nice sort of textured feel.As for the switches you can Google all you want but I had to actually try keyboards to get a feel for them.  Even the switch testers did me no good.  If you have a big box or computer store around see what they have on display and maybe you can get a feel for a few key types.  Personally I prefer browns.  I like the tactile bump theyre soft and fast enough for gaming I can type super fast with them and they have a satisfying but not loud sound.  This will all be personal preference though. I havent had any problems with mechanicalkeyboards.com.  theyve gotten my orders to me quickly and as expected.

6247731,0,t3_4159v0,Lubing the stabilizer would definitely help! We have a very comprehensive guide in the wiki and theres tons of tutorials all over the place. Mech boards also need a little bit of time I break in as well so that may also ease the issue. For keycaps youre in luck! On Massdrop right now theres the Granite DSA kit for the lowest price Ive seen. If thats not your boat check out Geekkeys. They make some really nice thick PBT a more durable type of plastic with a highly pleasant finish sets in a variety of colors. And theyre all available in blanks! Other than that just search around theres tons of sets out there. As for basic maintenance I will again point you to the excellent wiki guide. But basics are pretty much keep your stabilizers lubed clean your keyboard every few months use a brush or canned air although opinions on this vary and try not to spill water on it. Most mechs are very tolerant of abuse within reason of course. ,MechanicalKeyboards,cyzsslp,2,t5_2ugo7

Then someday the Chinese company decided to start its own brand Varmilo so Leopold had to look for a new partner. It turns out that they found some company in Taiwan. The new model just released in late  and for now there is no white version.Side storyMany companies only build a white version specially for the Chinese market. Reasons being . Chinese prefer white keyboards . Companies believe it is worthwhile to have a separate white version given the large scale of Chinese market. An extreme example Filco Minila Air.

What about scenarios that avoid driving altogether?Yes you get there faster. How much faster depends on your total distance that you go. The farther you have to go the faster the fast person will get there.gt Eh nope.  wpm  . wpmWhen I said e.g. in e.g. finish typing in half the time that means for example not necessarily reflecting the exact ratio. So youre sort of off base here with the nitpick.gt Typing has a long history of being associated to various musculoskeletal disorders see e.g. a large compilation by Kroemer .Not those feels these feels it gives me good feels to know Im leaving society in the dust and will finish typing my stuff in half the time that they will. Like I said in this postAlso this is beside the point but how are you going to cite a source that you have to pay to check and how you gonna not even give the page number or anything? gt Then I dont type it in the first place but use for instance a voice recorder instead its proven to be immensely more efficient especially in lectures.Why are you giving me your alternative? This discussion were having is whether or not  typing fast is irrelevant when  wpm is good enough for you. I gave you reasons why. You responding with alternatives is not even countering anything just giving other options.And since that is the case Id suggest that our conversation is over as its clear that the points of relevance I mentioned arent contested.,MechanicalKeyboards,cznln48,1,t5_2ugo7

You cant possibly go wrong with these ones  they are good all around !If you want less travel distance thick Orings  .mm will bottom out just after the keys registration point and simulate scissor switches on laptops or thin membrane keyboard but still retain the mechanical feel.,MechanicalKeyboards,cztbe6t,2,t5_2ugo7

Its on my Ducky Shine fire  edition.There may have been different variations of the Milk white switch much like there have been different variations of the MX Blue switch theres a MX dark blue variant going around with pictures recently which is sad to have a shrill click like a MX green while feeling much better than any current MX blue.Anyway to the original posterthe switch you are referring to is called the click grey which is currently not buyable anywhere.  However you can give Cherry an email and hope they reply back to you maybe theyll make you some samples!  Hell Im going to email Cherry myself later...I want me some click greys!If you want an actually commercially purchasable switch with a heavier press than greens you need to buy Tactile MX Grey switches.Good luck finding one in stock though!This one is out of stock,MechanicalKeyboards,d058y7b,2,t5_2ugo7

6655499,0,t1_d07nmpa,Heh. I really should post the SVG. For now Im sort of enjoying it being unique but Ill probably share it eventually.Theres a couple problems with printing the SVG asis for your own board though. For one the Varmilo VAM has a smaller nonstandard spacing between the F key row and the number key row. The curves around the F keys have been moved up in the SVG to compensate .px on the WASD template in case anyone else is preparing a print for the same board. You can see this in the render its most noticeable around the F and PrintScreenPauseBreak buttons where the green curvature doesnt appear to be correctly centered on the End key. Its correctly centered on the board. This would have to be undone to print it for a board with normal spacing which isnt possible from the final SVG Id need to reimport the original curves.For another I discovered that their printing process doesnt necessarily antialias correctly on overlapping curves of the same color. The  decal is made up of two overlapping lines but on the print theres a bit of red transparency along the vertical line of intersection between them you can see it if you really zoom in on the  in the first screenshot. I think this is probably fixable easily by merging the lines into one curve though.I could also give you the generated SVG and you could apply it to the keycaps yourself but theres a couple hours of work in Inkscape needed to actually fit them to the WASD template. Some curves are long enough to cover one of the pole keys and another key so I had to go through and manually boolean subtract a square mask from any curves that intersected them. This meant all the curves had to be converted from outline to filled paths which causes Inkscape to crash if you try to do it all at once its a whole thing... ugh.Im just rambling at this point. I could talk about this forever I spent way too long on it.,MechanicalKeyboards,d07qio3,6,t5_2ugo7

So in this case he was correct not to refund you unfortunately and due to the way a group buy works this makes sense. I know any amount of money lost is not trivial but even though delays are basically inevitable I would say it is safe to assume they will eventually deliver.This does bring up the point that doing a lot of research before joining any group buy from people on the forums should  be done. Normally if a persongroup are delayed on many of their buys future buys will be much of the same. Generally if you really want the item you can plan on waiting it out some delays are far out of the GB Leaders hands though others are fully under their control. My first rule in any group buy is not to spend money I cant technically afford to lose. I dont want to lose it or want delays but that is part of the preparationexpectation when joining a group buy. I totally understand the frustration of this situation Im looking down the barrel of  or  totally failed GBs right now but in the end there really isnt a lot to be done.

Theyll be somewhat clickier and a little lighter but also a lot smoother and less rough. You can find boards with these switches at KBParadise makes TKL and  boards with these switches for full size youll want to look at Matias own keyboards. All of these options are in your budget.KBParadise also makes boards that use a White Fukka switch which are very similar.Have fun I think ALPSMatias switches are superior to Cherries personally!,MechanicalKeyboards,d1milby,1,t5_2ugo7

Rosewill is the House brand of Newegg.Poseidon Z if you want to go cheap.  Pretty sure this has kailh switches.  If you drop down to TKL or smaller size there are a couple of other options.  Smaller size takes up less room on your desk and provides better ergonomics by moving the mouse closer.  Having moved to a TKL and  board my shoulder aches less.Royal Kludge TKL RGB with Greetech Switches Better than KailhQisan Magicforce Are a fantastic bargain.  Backlight adds a bit to the price.

It doesnt even give me any actuation feedback when typing fast just a constant stream of noise. Topre has my favorite actuation feedback which is basically just a deep sounding bottom out. I liked pokr clears too do you think stock mx clears are heavier than g zealios?Oh yeah another thing I noticed with the outemu blues is that my Vortex PBT and Rosewill ABS key sets have too much wobble ends up looking very strange. Also damn you went with the stock keycaps. PBT keycaps dampen the outemu blue click a lot. Try taking one of your switches and actuate it against various hard surfaces around your computer the switch itself makes very little noise but it resonates off everything.

Extrapolating from what I read on some of the firearms websites I would expect that Cerakote would be at least .x to x more expensive than powder.The price isnt bad for firearms applications where film thickness and finish toughness amp protection is critical. Powder really isnt an option here due to its film thickness.

7376646,0,t1_d2glymr,I used a solder sucker and a soldering iron. Im not a complete soldering noob but I dont have a lot of experience either. Id say its relatively easy desoldering LEDs sucks though.My process was. Add some extra solder to the soldering point. My solder flows quite a bit better than the OEM stuff it also melts faster so Id have it easier down the road. Get a comfortable angle for both the solder sucker and the soldering iron. Heat the solder with the iron while already having the solder sucker in the right place. As soon as you see that the all the solder is liquified use the solder sucker.On switches that worked on the first try  times LEDs maybe  but that was probably because I used a cheap solder sucker. If it didnt work and there was still a bit of solder left on the contact I just retried but if I thought there was not enough solder left I added some before retrying. Sometimes there is a tiny little bit of solder left holding in the contact if it really is just a little bit you can try to give it a little touch with a guitar pick or some other piece of plastic and it often breaks loose easily be careful though but you should feel when you can break it loose easily vs. there is still too much solder holding it in.I gave up on the LEDs after a while and just used the solder sucker to get one of the contacts free and remove the majority of solder from the other one. Then I heated the contact that was still stuck and pulled out the LED. This is definitely not the way you are supposed to do this but it worked out for me.,MechanicalKeyboards,d2go8xo,1,t5_2ugo7

7456455,0,t3_4h8qvu,The LEDs are not the limiting factor. If fed clean power they will gradually fail but do so by becoming less bright over time. If not heatsinked well enough unlikely they could go sooner. Most likely they are either being overdriven andor are being fed nasty power with a bunch of fast highmV ripple. They dont like that even if not overdriven based on average voltagecurrent. As the voltage rises the current drawn and thus heat generated goes up immensely. For some LEDs .V over spec sheet Vf might be pulling several times what the correct Vf pulls allowing high ripple to result in a ton of rapid heating and cooling cycles that the LED is simply not designed for.Personally Im wary of having  LEDs on something thats straight USB powered in general.,MechanicalKeyboards,d2pr2w0,2,t5_2ugo7

You can change the color of this mode on the software too but afaik its still not possible to set it to a random color on each keypress. But thats something that probably can be easily added via a softwarefirmware upgrade.CoolerMaster have told me on their forum that theyll be revealing a bit more info on the SDK soon its due for release but we dont know the ETA yet.The leds are bright enough for me... think Ducky Shine  brightness  color vivacity.

Most manufacturers make boards with those so you wouldnt be hard pressed to find better for less.If you want less common switches like Clears the WASD is nice because they do have it.

The resin coating makes sure the colors dont come off over time. I can also put things like stickersinlay on and resin coat those if needed.After that I mix some clear epoxy resin and apply it to the top. I use UScomposites epoxy but Ive tried other brands and they all seem to work the same. I think some hardware stores sell it. It is normally used for coating bar tops so you can imagine how tough the stuff is. The trick of course is in applying the resin but there is a lot of great info out there if you google it. Things like how to mix it using a heat gun to blow out the bubbles etc.I also wax them as the final step before shipping which deepens the gloss even further and provides a nice surface feel.,MechanicalKeyboards,d3ndchn,3,t5_2ugo7

8328824,0,t1_d5inhsd,I actually used two grits.The coating on these keycaps was very thick. And it gummed up the sand paper. So what I did was do an initial sand a light one with  grit. How I did this was I got an old bottle with the same curve as the keycaps wrapped the sandpaper around it then lightly sanded the majority of the coating off the keycap.After that I wrapped  grit around the same bottle and then gave a final hard pressure sand to each keycap. They are now smooth as butter like very smooth.  Grit did a fine job at making things nice.I took each key cap row off lined them up how they were on the keyboard and sanded one by one. Then cleaned them with airduster and a microfiber and put them on the keyboard and took the next row off.I did this because on this keyboard the keycaps are all different and I knew that if I took them all off at once I would never know which keycap went where when I go back to install them .,MechanicalKeyboards,d5inpdp,3,t5_2ugo7

8346341,0,t3_4twh4x,The keycaps the plastic bits with the letters on are pretty universal. The vast majority of keyboards use switches by Cherry or clones thereof so they use the same mounting system. ANSI and ISO are the two standard layouts. Some keyboards especially smaller ones break away from standard in order to e.g. fit more keys into a smaller form factor so then it can range from still easy to impossible to find full keycap sets for. Quick tip look at the AltCtrlWin keys. If theyre different sizes then its not a standard layout.Its possible to get custom keys printed via Max or WASD but theyre not fantastic quality. Mostly people just buy predesigned but super high quality keycaps like the everpopular Carbon set. There are two plastics in use ABS and PBT. ABS is the classic material youve seen in a million places. It gets shiny with use. PBT feels much better and doesnt shine.Switches arent impossible to replace but it can be done if youre handy with a soldering iron. A small number of cheap Chinese boards e.g. Team Wolf allow you to swap switches without soldering.Building your own is a significant challenge unless youre experienced with assembling electronics. There are kits and PCBs available including from big Chinese sites like Aliexpress.,MechanicalKeyboards,d5kugir,1,t5_2ugo7

Im left with a  that I find nice and comfortable to use mouse hand not too far from keyboard keyboard doesnt take up too much space. When making a custom board every little thing counts. Its your keyboard so make it yours. Each additional switch depending on the switch type you prefer adds up. A number pad as well as function keys adds an additional  dollars to the cost of my keyboard when considering switches ALONE. Processor compatibility as well as finding case plate pcb support is going to cost you an additional amount. If you like a big  keyboard no one is going to shit on you for it. To each their own.As for the  port on the laptop its a USB type C port. While its not widely used yet it has great functionality and can charge your laptop while transferring data at the same time. Im not defending apple for their product design but I like to think a multibillion dollar company has at least put some thought into it. The newer macbooks were not meant to be a standalone device. Artists and producers are meant to use them on the fly. Data transfer? Macs support multidevice usage as does windows and file sharing. The intranet exists USE IT.If you need a second display plug it into the USB type C port. the monitor will charge your laptop as well as receive video signals. ,MechanicalKeyboards,d5mn5ev,3,t5_2ugo7

8379393,0,t3_4ucl36,So I am in a pickle. I am pretty set on purchasing a Pokr but I cant decide if I want to do the WASD VP with Blues or buy a White Pokr with Clears off of Amazon. Id rather the White because it would match my color scheme but Im not experienced with Clear switches and Im concerned that gaming on them would be less than ideal. I currently have a CM Storm Quickfire Ultimate with Blues and I love it. The only downside is that I dont like the bulkiness of it and some of the switches are showing their age.Or for a potential third option Im willing to consider another compact keyboard granted that it fits my budget ish. Id like to do a  like the Pokr but Id also be willing to do an  or as a last resort standard Tenkeyless.Thanks in advance!,MechanicalKeyboards,d5oz17o,1,t5_2ugo7

8481560,0,t3_4vutoi,I have the Ducky One TKL but it should be the same process since both keyboards use Ducky Macro V.. First you need to make sure you are on a profile that is not the default profile because no macros can be added to the default profile.  For any steps that require the Fn key make sure to hold down the Fn key before any other keys  To enter macro recording mode hold down Fn  Ctrl for  seconds. You should see some kind of visual indicator that it is in macro recording mode on the Ducky One the caps lock scroll lock and mouse emulation lights blink while in macro recording mode. Now that you are recording press the desired key or key combination you want the macro to be recorded onto. Note Refer to your manual to see which key combinations cannot have macros recorded onto them. Then press Fn  Win  B for volume up Fn  Win  C for volume down. End macro recording mode by pressing Fn  Ctrl. This will increasedecrease your volume by one increment. To make a macro where you can hold the key to continuously change the volume press Fn  E before ending the macro recording. TLDR Make sure you are on a profile  and also recording to a key where macros can be recorded. Press Fn before any other keys if the step requires it.   Volume Up Fn  Ctrl hold  sec gt Press key you want gt Fn  Win  B gt Fn  Ctrl   Volume Down Fn  Ctrl hold  sec gt Press key you want gt Fn  Win  C gt Fn  Ctrl      For volume keys that function more naturally Volume Up Fn  Ctrl hold  sec gt Press key you want gt Fn  Win  B gt Fn  E gt Fn  Ctrl   Volume Down Fn  Ctrl hold  sec gt Press key you want gt Fn  Win  C gt Fn  E gt Fn  Ctrl,MechanicalKeyboards,d61qm65,1,t5_2ugo7

Gonna get the Barebones Standard layout Silver and DSA Lightcycle with Matias stems. Then Ill throw in some of the Matias Quiet Clicks I have lying around. This is gonna be great! uevangs do you think Massdrop can put up pictures of LightCycle with one or two of the case colors? Or have there been no sets produced at all yet?EDIT Oops I jumped the gun! Just scrolled down and saw that there are images of LightCycle with the turquoise case. That looks amazing! Another question for uevangs I guess Do you know if there will be homing F  J keys? The renders showed homingbars on them but I think that was when you were planning for DCS right?

Its a different kind of heavy though resistance at the top and then it clicks down instead of how Browns get heavier as you go down. It might be worth trying them to see if you like them. The weight doesnt always make a difference in how long I can type comfortably for example my Greens tired me out but I could type on Buckling Spring for a good while before tiring.

8815244,0,t1_d77gh94,So I think the Ducky One TKL RGB seems like it should be good for you but it isnt out atm so you will have to atleast wait  months. But if you are interested there is the MK Disco TKL RGB which is a keyboard made in collaboration with ducky so it will have all the good looking and build quality that ducky keyboards have. Only thing with it is that it isnt using genuine cherry mx switches but that doesnt mean they are bad though. The masterkeys pro S is also a good choice but I personally think the two st ones are better. About which switches to choose from its really up to you. Here is a guide that might help you decide which switch you will want. Just something to remember is that even though red switches are the ones preferred for gaming Ive heard that for MOBA games they arent the best instead you might want to look at browns and blues. Also most knock off switches use the same color so a knockoff blue switch will be like a cherry mx blue switch. ,MechanicalKeyboards,d77h0o8,3,t5_2ugo7

Me and a lot of others have also found their WPM are highest on these but I guess thats subjective.

9107087,0,t3_5488m1,Im one of the people you talked to who was interested in buying one. Like others have said Im much less likely to purchase one at this price point. I understand you want to do this in an efficient manner and still make a profit but it doesnt make sense for me as a budgetconscious buyer to pay this amount. The case is no longer handmade by you and while this may result in more consistent products shouldnt labor costs go down? Sorry to be blunt or ignorant on this but if theyre designing it and making it doesnt that just make you a middle man? A middle man who has no choice but to pay insane shipping costs?If I really needed a wood case and were to spend this much on one I think itd make more sense for me to buy a Royal Glam one. The manufacturer has already established a good reputation and it would hold its value more so than an Anne case. I would shell out a bit more money for a standard  board as well. Thats honestly how I see things from the perspective of a consumer. Of course Im still waiting to see the final product before ruling anything out. Hope everything works out for you though!,MechanicalKeyboards,d86ixii,2,t5_2ugo7
9107244,0,t3_5507aq,I know the feeling. I have  boards both that feel markedly different. Not sure what the reason is though. The springs are the same across the two and the caps are also basically the same I swapped over some of my old XT caps to the pseudoSSK and they just feel amazing only wish they had homing indicators. Boltmodding fixed the hollow sound that the pseudoSSK had premod. Much tighter feeling and much more responsive. However I had to fiddle a bit with the bolt mod to get it to feel like that too tight and the response is very muted. Too loose and it feels light moist towelettes. Maybe adjust the nuts in certain areas that feel strange.  ,MechanicalKeyboards,d86jly1,1,t5_2ugo7

9113533,0,t3_54z6j9,Theres an awesome wiki page with all the info you need That plus just lurking and taking note of how people do certain things and dont be afraid to ask questions because the people on this sub seem to be unbelievably friendly.As a fellow Aussie though I live outside the country now Jaycar will probably have everything you need in terms of electrical supplies soldering iron diodes wire etc. If you live near a city you should be able to find a local shop that can fulfill any acrylic or metal cutting needs you may have. If you go the PCB route not that you need to theres plenty of examples on this sub of people wiring boards manually Im not aware of any place that prints PCBs but you can probably find a place somewhere in Aus thatll accept orders online and ship to you.In terms of cost its probably going to be significantly more expensive than the costs of builds youll see on here. I would recommend sourcing as much stuff locally as possible as utyggerjai mentioned shipping is what will blow your cost way up.

9115486,0,t1_d87dy30,gt Spacing the FRow. I dont know which I like more aesthetically and while I would like this to stay compact it doesnt add much height and most importantly doesnt affect the width.I prefer no gap in between because the finger travel is shorter.gt Split Backspace. Just because I can but its really not necessary.Its preferable IMHO if youre going to use unix backspace like ANSI HHKBwhich I highly recommenda u cap above it is a waste.gt Right side of the bottom row. It seems like I might as well have the extra key but Im limited on caps to use with HyperFuse.It depends what you actually use in practice. If you ask me a keyboard must have AltGr and right Control because theyre heavily used by certain layoutssoftware.gt Split right shift. This I think could be cool for quick FN access like IJKL arrows but it might be hard to adjust to the shorter shift and I have dedicated arrows anyway.The pictured layout always has .u right Shift. I think you mean ISOANSI left Shift. Its personal preference ANSI is easier to reach whereas ISO enables angle mod ZXCV shifted one key to the left for typing at a different angle or an extra key Composemodifier.gt Stepped caps lock. No good reason not to just something to consider.Depends on your keycap preference and how you use the key because its much more useful when remapped to CtrlFnBackspaceAnother note on the pictured layout its great that the physical layout of the tenkey is mirrored to maintain the proper fingering scheme but numbers would benefit from rearranging too Benfords law  is more common than   thus it might deserve a more flexible finger i.e. the index finger.,MechanicalKeyboards,d87j8dg,2,t5_2ugo7

9145953,0,t3_55kcw6,Ive learned a few things after finishing this mod that I hope will help those modding their HHKBs in the future!The first is that no Cherry spacebar will fit the Novatouch spacebar stabs when transferred to the HHKB. Here is a comparison of a u Cherry spacebar I attempted to mod the stock HHKB spacebar and a .u spacebar.The second is that YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR SPACEBAR STABS ARE IN THE RIGHT WAY! I originally tried to switch stabs only to find that none of my stabs depressed correctly. It was only after I rebuilt my HHKB again that I realized that my stabs were in the wrong way. Switching their orientation  degrees made them buttery smooth again!The third is that the modifier modules are not transferable between boards. The HHKBs modifier modules are non removable. Youll  have to drill out holes for the stabs.The fourth is that a Dremelpocketknifefile combo is great for drilling your stabilizer holes. Start with the Dremel and smooth out the edges with the file. You can also use sandpaper over something like a pen.Fifth is that clipping your spacebar stabilizer wings is AOK if you plan on trying to cobble together a Cherry spacebar for your HHKB. Just make sure to put them back the right way of theyll feel horrible.Say a prayer for the donor boardI hope you enjoyed this adventure into the unknown.

Id assume youd get lt normally gt when pressed with shift then youd use something like Alt Gr for the |? QMK references a keymap so it knows how many keys to expect and how to lay them out. Take a look at thisThis for an ANSI layout youll need to make an ISO one. I made an ISO on for a Satan Ill try find it for you. Its in my comment history somewhere... Itd be a good starting point anyway. Edit Looks like its already in the repo handily So youd need something similar to that but also with the additional keys that TADA supports.

Not very loud is relative Ive only had one membrane keyboard thats louder than reds. Linear basically just means he wont feel any bump or click as the key is pressed and its probably the easiest adjustment from membrane keyboards. Theyre also targeted towards gamers though any switches works about equally well.Browns are like reds except instead of being linear theyre tactile they have a bump on them as the key is pressed.Blacks are also like reds except theyre heavier. Not much more to say really its a preference.Blues are not like reds at all. Theyre loud and clicky tactile with sound. Theyre decently popular and a lot of people do like audio feedback as well as tactile feedback for when they press a button.There are also much more different colors greens and clears are the big ones and different brands gaterons well liked zealios are very well liked outemu like on the magicforce or kailh like on the blackwidow arent as liked but still good and even entirely different types alps topre but those  are probably what youll see mostly on the options youll run into.Now if your brother hasnt used a mech before itll probably be pretty arbitrary which you choose. Any of them should be fine. I might not get him blues just because you might have to hear it a fair bit but reds browns and blacks are all nice switches to have.,MechanicalKeyboards,d8hd59p,1,t5_2ugo7

If its the thock of bottoming out then changing switches wont matter as much.

Ill assume that its a typo and answer that question.I have a TKL that I like quite a bit if you like that formfactor. Its the MK Disco from MechnicalKeyboards.com. Specifically you can use their advanced search to find keyboards meeting your specific criteria. For example heres all TKL RGBs with MX Blues Not many and preorder only. If youre okay with Cherry knockoff switches they have other blue options so fiddle with the switch section to see what else they have. For example I have an MK Disco TKL thats an RGB board with KBT switches. I like the board quite a bit and the switch difference isnt that big of a deal for me. I use it for gaming when Im on a mic and want to annoy the shit out of my friends. Heres that searchThat said I dont use the TKL form factor for anything other than gaming. I use a  day to day every day for typing and programming and enjoy it immensely. I switch frequently between a few pokers with different switches and my Leopolds  form factors for the arrows when I want a different feel andor sound. Pokers are programmable while the Leopold isnt but the programming I do is basically limited to moving the windowsalt keys Im on a mac  I dont do much more than that honestly.Let me know if you have more questions.

I currently use my Ducky Shine  MX Blue cherrys as my home keyboard. I did bring in my DS into work and a coworker complained that it was too loud thus me purchasing the WhiteFox with Zealios. My question is would Zealios still be too loud? I read that Zealios arent that loud however the aluminum body makes it a bit louder? Also I use a keyboard extensively at work. How long would it take for me to get accustomed to a  keyboard? In the near future I could see myself purchasing a numpad keyboard. The only thing that concerns me is the F buttons.

It was a tribute to the SGI GraniteIts the introduction of the coloured mods that makes Granite DSA highly identifiable within this community. The red escape and blue enter combo is unmistakably Mattos design work. Without that it would be simply grey on grey which would be very difficult to claim as original. What is grey territory here pun admitted and apologised for is the use of the elven runes. Thats likely the intellectual property of the Tolkein estate or New Line Cinema or someone who isnt the keyset designer or manufacturer... The remarkable part is that when this pirate producer ripped off mattos design they ripped absolutely everything.

9618184,0,t3_5cpckz,I didnt do a lot of research the last time I bought a semi mechanical keyboard the Topre Type Heaven.  I liked it but it recently died after only   years probably from spills.  I got a bad rubber dome as a replacement since I dont have the funds for a mechanical keyboard but I bought the switch tester from WASD out of curiosity and I will probably get a Cherry switch board when I have more money maybe with my tax refund.  The Topre when I bought it was around  I thought and now  its  at Amazon.  Id like to stay around that same price or less if possible.  I dont really want backlighting but its not a huge deal.  Im pretty sure I want a full keyboard but am willing to consider other options.So the switches!  Ill admit that I thought I would want brown switches without Orings but I have discovered I really like the smaller Orings even though I miss the sound with browns that is  I actually prefer the sound of the click alone with blues.  The feel is better to me with the Orings.  I also know that I really dont like the black switch.  The green and clear feel too stiff and at g I like the brown better than the red.  But I also like the blue switch especially after trying it with the Oring which I wasnt expecting at all I mean I thought I would like the blue but wouldnt want the Oring.Here are my thoughtsI have very small hands and my pinkies in particular are not very strong.  They the pinkies definitely prefer the smoother and lighter brown switches.  But for my index and middle fingers I really like the crispness of the bump in the blue and I really love the sound of the click especially after removing the clack with the Oring.  I also compared the pinky issue with my current keyboard the bad rubber dome and the keys are much stiffer than even the blues and Ive been able to type fine so maybe blues will be better overall.  However the main time I need clicky sounds is when Im writing a novel and I have a program Focus Writer that adds typewriter sounds including the Return sound which I really love! as I write so I dont REALLY need my keyboard to click.  Im also thinking that hearing the typing noises only when I am writing the novel is helping me to get and stay in the novel and differentiate from when I am just surfing the web or something.  So in that case maybe browns are really the best option.  Ack!  Those of you whove tried both for maybe longer than just the few days and one key of each that Ive tried what conclusions have you drawn?For typing I use Dvorak just switched last year and already I feel but dont know that my typing is faster than it was with QWERTY but I like being able to see the QWERTY keys for certain games Skyrim in particular does this awesome thing where it recognizes keybindings as from QWERTY but typing is still in Dvorak.  I think in an ideal world I would like to see both since I dont have some of the control options memorized yet cut bold and underlining in particular but if I have to choose I want to stay with QWERTY.Ill admit that I was very impressed by WASD particularly the custom keyboard because I do prefer a more nondescript design.  Im tempted by the fact that they will install the Orings for me but if I do it myself and buy the rings from them I save  and possibly more if I get them somewhere else though I havent looked.  My main concern with this is that I dont know that I would do as good of a job as a professional and Im not sure if it matters how high up the stem it goes.  I already managed to pull a whole switch out of the casing because I put the keycap back on the wrong way.  Ive briefly looked into the Das as well.   While I do enjoy games I dont feel I need a gaming keyboard but maybe Im overlooking something because of that.  Im glad that the two switches I like are very popular and accessible but that also means more options to choose from which can be bad for a very indecisive person such as myself.  What other advice do you have?  Oh and I live alone so noise is not at all an issue.,MechanicalKeyboards,d9yn0fx,2,t5_2ugo7

The wire is heavier than the soldering iron itself making it very difficult to put down safely and the DC power jack is directly on the unit so brief loss of power as you move it around which requires user intervention to start the heating element back up is a possibility especially if you buy a cheap thirdparty power supply with a right angle connector which really should have been included as it puts much less stress on the connector.Its not a bad choice by any means but it makes sacrifices for its size and portability which most people dont need.,MechanicalKeyboards,d9z93iz,2,t5_2ugo7

That doesnt mean theres no reason for them to  most people prefer an external wrist rest so the market isnt necessarily huge. Since Ive never touched or heard of them though I cant really speak to their quality one way or another. They do however look overpriced. There are keyboards such as the Ducky One that has a builtin macro function but then you have to dedicate a key to the macro.

10207280,0,t1_dc10ze2,. Yes. All programmable keyboards that I know of store the layout on the keyboard itself. Otherwise you could just use Autohotkey or Karabiner to do something similar on your PC.. Dont know. I dont have an iPad.. Ideally you should have your keyboard angled away from you actually. Not angled toward you like all the conventional keyboards have it. This is because you want to have the keyboard in an as natural position as possible. This means having your wrists straight. A flat keyboard is good as well. You just have to make sure your typing posture is good. Dont lean your hands on anything. Rest your arms beside your body in a relaxed fashion. Your elbows should be at  degrees and your wrists should be straight. The height of your desk and chair also play a role in ergonomics of course.. You should really try out switches before committing on a keyboard purchase. Get a switch tester or try out some mechanical keyboards at a local store. I found that the weight of the switch does not necessarily correlate with wrist pain. I have g switches and I have no issues whatsoever. I did have issues when I just started typing on mechanical keyboards and when I adjusted my typing posture or had to get used to a different layout ortholinear. But its fine now. As for quiet switches any non clicky switch should do the job. And if that is not quiet enough for you you can always add orings silencing clips or lube.. Depends on whether you care for the international characters. ISO compatibility kits are pretty much the norm right now but it will cost you a bit more of course. ANSI is really the standard as far as keycap sets are concerned.. Waiting on the Whitefox is going to take a long long time. And shipping from Massdrop can take months as well. I would just get a prefab keyboard. Plenty of those have metal backplates as well. And there are some that also sport a metal case such as the Pokr.Going by that last paragraph the Pokr is actually quite suited for you. It is a  keyboard that is programmable. It has media functions on it by default and you can change where the arrows are as well.,MechanicalKeyboards,dc11vvm,2,t5_2ugo7

10410573,0,t3_5p2hdj,When you press the A or the B keys the keyboard does not send an A or a B character to the computer instead it sends a code say  and  the computer then looks up in a table and determines that code  corresponds to an A and  to a B. Its therefore trivial to create a layout based on whatever you want by virtue of make a new lookuptable. This is the kind of characters that I can type easily on any keyboard provided my custommade layout software not hardware is installed on the computer           It doesnt matter if your keyboard is ANSI or ISO  as long as it does have the keys and you have your layout defined and installed.For Windows use a piece of software by Microsoft called MSKLC.

Both seem to suffer from lighting issues. The Vortex set is cheaper since theres free shipping and no sales tax but Im not exactly sure if theres anything better about the WASD set that might set it apart.Im also open to any suggestions for any high quality keycaps that arent backlit like Double Shot PBTPOM.

10485575,0,t3_5q5r7t,Im not a Mac user but I think I can point you in the right direction. First select a layer by pressing FN  layer key it should be labeled under some of the keys. An LED light to the left of your spacebar should light up to indicate which layer you have selected. To enter programming mode press both FN and right control at the same time. A blue LED should come up. Select the key you want to program. You can even overwrite the FN layer by pressing FN  the key you want. From here the blue LED should become a blinking red LED. Now enter in the key combination you want e.g. shortcut for window management. Press Pn to lock in the programming and the keyboard should be ready to accept another key programming. If you take too long the keyboard will cancel the programming and revert the key back to its default function.,MechanicalKeyboards,dcwndhh,1,t5_2ugo7

10502003,0,t1_dcyduii,Thank you for the update. I dont think any of us are particularly mad for lack of a better term because of the multiple delays. Its rather because our emails or at least mine are being ignored updates are coming in late or not at all and we get information about situations when shit has already hit the fan.Its just really frustrating and sometimes a bit fishy to me that we are not updated from the start about how things are gonna go. I already feel bad for making this thread but I guess my frustrations got the better hand of me after being ignored weeks on end.When the shippings are gonna be split into  tell us and dont wait until there are problems with the shipments. All of this send us an email to cancel is like saying its easier to ask for forgiveness than to ask for permission which isnt true in this case. Even when there is nothing to update us about wed still like to know after a couple of days. There have been  days without an update so far. That can be expected when its the beginning of the GB but wed love to get more frequent updates the closer our orders are to shipping.Im not cancelling my order because I doubt Ill get any mod switches otherwise. But I will reconsider getting keycaps from Originative because of the imo bad customer service. This hobby is already pretty pricey and when you pay  for a keyset then I would expect to not have facts hidden from me. So Ill get my keysets elsewhere even though I would love to get Penumbra for example.,MechanicalKeyboards,dcyihh6,27,t5_2ugo7

10514577,0,t1_dczx6wu,Obviously you can also have a tailor do it for you but there is actually a hitch in that jeans are typically hemmed with a chain stitch which not every tailor canwill do for you. Also you typically want to wash your jeans before you get them hemmed since denim shrinks a good amount after washing but if youre buying high quality raw denim especially you will often not want to wash it for a while.I intended to hem my current jeans but by the time I had worn and washed them there was already a bit of wear showing where I had cuffed them. And also since they were raw denim there was a nice sharp crease where I had cuffed them that looked pretty clean.,MechanicalKeyboards,dczxubc,4,t5_2ugo7

10517978,0,t3_5qlpru,This actually might get more discussion over at rwoodworking but I do hobby woodworking as my other walletdraining hobby and I can give my two cents. Wood is generally categorized into two groups hardwoods and softwoods. As long as you stick with a hardwood that it relatively easy to work you should be fine. Walnut chocolatey brown after finish is applied hard maple pleasantly pale with nice a golden hue and cherry reddish brown are all readily available at your local Home Depot or Lowes and are very tightgrained and nice to work with. Poplar pale green is cheaper and very easy to work but is actually softer than pine so it wouldnt be ideal for the final case but would work well for prototyping. You can check the hardness of each species against each other on the Janka Scale Try to use sections that are knot free and have straight grain to prevent weird warping after milling. A sprayon finish would be easiest but wipeon poly worked well for me. Youll want to apply finish in thin layers with light sanding between every few layers. ,MechanicalKeyboards,dd0brbj,1,t5_2ugo7

I can now cross this project off my bucket list and even though I have another handwired project I want to get to a key Atreus I think Ive had enough handwiring fun to last me the next six months. I hope.This is a key  keyboard that had been brewing in my head for a while. Several months ago I asked ujolimon to cut a case for me so I could test it out and see if I liked it. I started on it but had so many shorts that I pulled it all apart. In the process of removing the switches  originally Cherry MX Grays  I broke the .mm switchplate beyond repair. I ended up ordering a new one from Lasergist.The layout is here I decided to go with inswitch diodes because I foolishly thought itd be a cleaner setup. I used  awg bell wire for the rows and  awg wrapping wire for the columns and the Teensy.Special thanks to uABCitsEASY for giving me the best advice for handwiring I could have gotten from anybody. Also thanks to udeaconblue for his photo of his inswitch diode wiring which got me over the how do I do this hump.I have one more handwired project I want to do but I think Im good for about six months before I even consider tackling that project.,MechanicalKeyboards,dd1vz81,5,t5_2ugo7

10778542,0,t3_5u6661,There are different ones regarding thickness which defines how much they reduce key travel. Also there are differences in hardness which makes the typing feel more or less mushy. Also it depends which keycaps you put them on. I think on cherry profile gmk only thin ones fit and on SA profile you almost need two of the thicker ones per key. Since Im on mobile right now I dont have the exact sizesdegrees of hardness at hand.Editthey only reduce the sound of the downstroke though. But with mx reds you can use them just fine.

10938638,0,t1_de885ur,I guess it depends on what you consider layout. That word refers to several different things. People often interpret it as one of at least three things  Keymap layout  QWERTY AZERTY Dvorak Colemak etc.  Number of keysfootprint    TKL etc Key placement in the board  ANSI ISO HHKB layout etcWhat Im referring to in the last of these three. A standard layout implies the bottom row will be the following in keysizes.u .u .u .u .u .u .u .uThat will be the bottom row of key sizes on the main cluster of the keyboard. The spacebar is the .u while the  caps to the left and  caps to the right are all .u each. Corsair and a lot of other brands do NOT us this placement. Instead they adjust it making some of those caps smaller which can be annoying if you plan to use aftermarket keysets at any point. ,MechanicalKeyboards,de88scx,3,t5_2ugo7

10968551,0,t3_5wky3k,The only mechanical keyboards Ive ever had were  or . Ive never missed the arrow keys on either of those. In fact I prefer having them on the function layer. That way they are easier and quicker to use.The small size of the keyboard is also a plus for a few reasons. It minimizes hand movement which is great. It allows you to have your hands closer when using both mouse and keyboard which is much more comfortable and ergonomic. And you can more easily take it with you which is what I did every day to and from work. And many people do not need a numpad. And if they do they get a separate one which they can put on the other side of the keyboard so its more ergonomic. Or they program a numpad onto a function layer.One of the main reasons why the HHKB specifically is expensive is not because of the small size or anything. Its mostly because whats under the keys. Topre boards are more expensive in general.,MechanicalKeyboards,debbu16,1,t5_2ugo7

10969829,0,t1_deb8f6x,No question is ever dumb if you have a intrest in the possible answer.No I have no attraction to the ISODE layout personally its just what Im used to. If I can have a nice set of keys without learning a new keyboard layout thats the solution Id approach first.If there is no other option than to use the ANSI layou I think I could get used to that.Generally speaking I think that the majority of germans is just using their keyboard as a piece of equipment to fulfill their needs. So to speak it would really suprise me if my mom or dad even knew there were any other layouts out there.I do see the value of other layouts regarding programming software and code but the majority of people is just surfing the web browsing stores and messaging friends and family. For that its more usefull to have    readily available without having to use some sort of ALT GR  Button combination.I hope that answers your question  if not let me know and I try to answer again ,MechanicalKeyboards,debgl0d,1,t5_2ugo7

Some of the older Razer used Cherry switches which I would say are accurate while some of the newer ones uses Razer switches which should be Greetech or Kailh switches.

We can go with that. Maybe you should locate a switch tester to make sure what switch you want firsts as you plan to keep this a while. Note Eagletec KG is black. I simply linked to the white one. There is no black version of MagicForce Though same with Nixeus Moda Pro. Check the honorable mentions Rosewill RKV is very classic looking and black. But not backlit.

They make both an RGB version in black and white for a bunch of the standard switches red black brown blue and also a version without backlighting that comes with stock PBT keycaps. The older Ones are full size and were meant to be somewhat like the Shine without backlighting though I think theyve fully embraced that the One is now their TKL board.Regardless these boards all have standard layouts so any MXcompatible keycap set PBT or not would fit.As for the Mediafunction keys you can see them listed out about halfway down the specs page found here but its good to note that nearly every key on the board is fully customizable so if theres something you use often you can set up your own functionmacro.,MechanicalKeyboards,denxdvi,1,t5_2ugo7

11164150,0,t1_dexan7h,I appreciate your response! I think what youve said is fair.Yes I did use membrane as opposed to rubber domes to draw a line between rubber domes and Topre without remembering that it just blurs a line somewhere else. AaaaYou caught me  there are several switches I have yet to try and I acknowledge that. However I do feel like linears are fundamentally unappealing to me  They do feel nice but the fastest speed I could get on any linear Ive tried is WPM less than my average. I dont expect much from even a significantly better linear. Ill gladly change my attitude towards linears if I am ever graced with one that I really like!Regarding Cherry MX switches fair enough. I do see those same criticisms from time to time and feel that they are the silent fraction of the community but it might be a majority in any case.Regarding overpriced gaming keyboards I agree that they packin a lot of excessive features. I do lament that the best Razer Ive felt is a Chroma one  the most expensive. I didnt feel too happy having to pay for RGB that I dont care about. That said I cant set the matter of switches aside as thats exactly what matters most to me meanwhile things like custom keycaps and such  Id love to but not in the foreseeable future. To that end until I come across a switch that feels notably better than my AZ yellows or my Razer  greens I would defend my purchases.I DO think better switches are out there but not ones that I can try without making online purchases. Im not above that but I dont think a switch tester is enough to make an informed decision about the typing experience and so I figure I have to be very careful about buying keyboards online. So that too is not in the foreseeable future.I actually argued the very point you did when reviewing the Vortex Core  the fact that smaller keyboards are programmable is great. Though I prefer several different functions  such as the entirety of the nav cluster  having dedicated keys. I use those keys every  minutes or so. My hand does move around a bit more but its more arm movement vs more keypresses or holds to do macros and modifiers and such. I prefer the former.,MechanicalKeyboards,dexg0li,1,t5_2ugo7

11287425,0,t1_dfbeowl,Yep you can still use WASD like normal. Compare the POKR to a full size keyboard. The POKR doesnt have a numpad dedicated arrow keys or the F keys F F .... like the full size keyboard does.With keyboards that are the size of the POKR or smaller there are layers so you can still access the keys that were removed. You do this by holding the FN function key and then pressing another key.For example if you wanted to press the F key on the POKR you would hold the FN key and press the  key. If you wanted to use the left arrow key you would hold the FN key and press J. That is the default way. If you dont like it that way you could reprogram it to make it say Caps Lock and W.

They also mention the fact that it would install another program called LSE this was to allow OneKey Optimizer OKO to be installed. To me this isnt ok especially because the name screams keylogger but in their defense it was nonpersonally identifiable system data that would be sent straight to Lenovo servers. The part that people got hung up on was that the program was not secure and opened the flood gates for people claiming that Lenovo is hacking us which is painfully untrue.TLDR The programs installed by Lenovo were meant to help streamline the process of their Laptops for users that dont know how to install the software that is needed by some of Lenovos proprietary apps like Lenovo Settings or Lenovo Companion and only became news because the networking wasnt  safe.,MechanicalKeyboards,dfw9gmf,0,t5_2ugo7

11481527,0,t1_dfwygz3,To me yes. Its just a little too awkward and straining on my pinky. As a developer I dont often write a lot of text all at once its more small snippets then navigate around. Because so much of what I do is navigating I cant stand using the Pokers arrow keys for that long. Hitting insert delete home and end the other  nav keys I really would like to be physical arent as big of a deal because even though I use them often its usually only a single press compared to arrows which you press multiple times when you do.Now I will say this Ive really only used my Poker for a full day of work one time other than that its just been one off side project type stuff. Also I havent tried any custom stuff much like putting the vim keys as the arrows or using caps lock as Fn instead.I havent used any s but the two I was interested in are Leopolds FCM or C and Varmillos VAM. The M seems a little better just from the docs I like that Fnarrows in it are navigation home end page updown while on the VAM it was LED controls. That is a point to the Poker though if you dont like the controls you can rebind them. Also the VAM had page updown instead of homedelete which would be better to me but you could rebind it with autohotkey or something. What kind of board do you use now?,MechanicalKeyboards,dfxffu5,2,t5_2ugo7

11482423,0,t1_dfxin0j,Im only guessing and of course hindsight is  but looking at their Znaps product and video now this doesnt even look to me like it would work.  They show the magnetic connectors snapping together but there is no way disconnection would work since the iPhone or whatever device receptacle isnt made to grip the plug adapter they stuck into it.  In other words any magnet strong enough to attach is also going to be strong enough to yank the connector plug out of the phone or device thats not originally designed to lock onto the cable.  So unless youre supergluing their Znaps adapter to the phone which wont stick magnetically the connection is still just as prone to come out at the conventional cable and plug end.But thats why I dont fund investors without a biography and history of success at least not for complex devicessolutionsif this were a drinking mug carved from wood that might be different.,MechanicalKeyboards,dfxj3u1,1,t5_2ugo7

Though the USB ports on the HHKB are really under powered and I cant use a numpad on mine. Could be different in some cases though. For your next board I wholeheartedly recommend the TypeS or a silenced Realforce. Silenced Realforce where the tactility is preserved really is a step ahead of stock Topre imo. I love me some good T H O C C but the TypeS is always satisfying and great to take to class and in the library.

11777486,0,t1_dguhfvi,So i am on my keyboard all day. I work on a computer. My life is spent interacting with a machine through an interface. I could get a  keyboard but I dont. Instead I have something that feels nice to type on. Something that sounds nice to type on. The switches are customized to my liking so it actually feels so nice to type. Like Im excited to touch my keyboard. Id also argue for a large number of mech keyboards the build quality is better. There are many different preferences but I prefer a . The whitefox in OP is  I believe and I really want one someday. I went with the size I did because it means my mouse is right next to me rather than across two additional sections of keys as it would be in a full size keyboard. This means my hand moves less my keyboard is more centered and I dont feel like my mouse hand is far as fuck away when I use it. Because I prefer a layout that is condensed having the ability to program it is important to me. I went with a keyboard that is fully programable with up to  layers. I dont use all of them only  but their nice to have. I was able to customize how these layouts work so that it feels optimal to me. And since that programming is done on the keyboard level no matter what computer I plug my board into it works the way I like it. This is a device I use all the time. More so than most of my possessions. Its a tool of my trade. As such Im completely fine with spending a few hundred to make all the hours I spend typing more pleasant. Many people customize their boards with keycaps that match their style. With keycap profiles and keyboard layouts they feel are more comfortable. Its a very personal item in a way and as such its fun to make it your own with limitless customizations. edit btw this dude gives a great overview of some benefits of a programable keyboard Also a lot of these boards are made to order in super small quantity runs which makes them both exclusive and expensive to produce. ,MechanicalKeyboards,dgv0kby,3,t5_2ugo7
