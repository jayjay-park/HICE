6280167,0,t1_cz3gl6r,You sir are a fucking arrogant asshole. Seriously. I dont care what you do or who you do it for. I really dont. Save your bragging. If switches could be properly virtualized Cisco would do it. YOU OBVIOUSLY DONT KNOW NETWORKING. Cisco virtualizes lots of things. They dont really virtualize switches. It simply doesnt work with how their switches work. Fuck. I know youve never tried it or you wouldnt waste my time and everyone elses with your random bragging moment gt US nuclear command and control That made me laugh. Thank you. Ever heard of an ASIC?  Its hardware. Not software. Ever used the nexus v?  Its nothing like the kk. It had limitations mainly in the layer  domain. I cant believe we are still having this fucking discussing. So let me break down in words you can understand mr networking. OSI layer. Layer   logical Easy to virtualize. Layer   physicalHard hard to virtualize Layer   the wire Impossible to virtualize dont say virtual links and such because then you are simply trying to derail the convo by being a bigger dick. Im not lazy. I know all the virtual solutions for Cisco and layer  isnt one of them. If you bothered to check it out for yourself or maybe not talk about how amazing you are youd not made this post. In short. Youre ridiculous and wrong. ,ccnp,cz3hgju,1,t5_2qjhj

6661159,0,t3_46v545,Alright Ive seen these kinds of postsquestions come up time and time again. When I was more of a sysadmin we used with each new version of Windows Server that it was going to be so easy the company was going to get rid of their MCSEs it never happened.Then it was cloud companies were going to fire all their network staff close down their data centers fire the rack monkeys who install Windows for you and put everything in AWS that never happened. If anything the networking got more complex and the only people who have to worried are the people whos only value is installing Windows on a physical server.Now it is SDN what is SDN? We have actually it for a long time.In the early days you can see EIGRP as a soft SDN because the metrics attempted to take things like load into account it didnt really work out but it was there. Then there was OER which was the predessor to PfR and now iWAN is PfR  DMVPN it works by having  the master controller make decisions for the borders. For the configuration side we have always had various tools like ASDM to make configuring things easier and now we have APIC and APICEM.If you have ever worked on a wireless controller or a firewall with a mgmt station you have worked on something that pushes configuration down to dumb hosts just like a openflow node.VXLANs the glue of the SDN overlay is really just the latest in long line of LVPNs and STP killers.Scripting has always been a part of network engineering and it always will be. Of course you can get fairly far without scripting anything but eventually you are going to have a request to add some config to  devices and your going to have to pick between scripting something using a config manager or doing it by hand  and if your doing it by hand you should have a conversation with yourself as to why. Knowing nix and Windows shells is a good thing to spend time on because it will help you in many ways. About a month ago I solved a CCNA challenge post with some nix skills to prove a point anything that helps you work smarter not harder is a good thing. Besides I frequently say a good network engineer should have solid nixWindows infrastructure skills.If you have seen any of my posts or comments youll probably pick up that I use regex constantly Im not sure why you listed it in with everything else but Im pro regex and you need to know it anyway for BGP and CLI mastery.Lately I have been bitten by the SDN bug Ive been spending more time on OpenFlow OpenDaylight ACI APIC APICEM as well as things like Openstack and Vagrant. Im also working on the CC Cloud track so believe me when I tell you None of this stuff is going to take away your need to understand how protocols work. It makes it more complicated. APICEM makes it easier to configure iWAN but what do you do when it fails?Actual SDN adoption is pretty slow and it is far perfect for example there is no guarantee a Openflow . switch will be able to upgraded to Openflow .x down the road.Long story is that if your working towards your CCNPCCIE whatever keep on the path while the next CCIE version may get iWAN back OERPfR was on v and they might toss in APICEM or such they will simply add the topics and thats that. As for job requirements a lot of senior jobs have said that scripting at least a nice to have so that isnt changing much. They might ask for experience with OpenDaylight or such but at the end of the day it is no different from a job posting that asks for Cisco and Juniper experience. You can still apply with no Juniper and say youll learn.,ccnp,d08bkgw,3,t5_2qjhj

7125343,0,t1_d1o208h,Its actually a really narrow minded view of the world. Not everyone has access to high speed internet WAN circuits. Mpls is really only going to exist in first world countries where dark fiber was laid by the truck load twentythirty years ago. Meanwhile there are plenty of places that require a T type circuit or possibly even FR or ATM as a secondary wan. Its not totally dead. Just mostly. Certainly mpls is a ccie level concept. If FR were removed I cant think of something good to slot in its place in the curriculum. ,ccnp,d1o2ilx,1,t5_2qjhj

10861978,0,t3_5v7pgs,I originally hoped to avoid injecting my current selection of hardware though I fear that given the many configurations model services etc. that I should probably provide something to show Im truly serious of accomplishing my goal.x WSCTS w cipserviceskmz..SEx WSCTTL w clanbasekmz..SEFrom reading ipservices offers more services than lanbase though I cannot find a  with ipservices feature set so I assume perhaps wrongly that it isnt possible due to chipsetmemory?Im contemplatingx GPSS w cipserviceskmz..SEHowever the lack of ios  on this has me concerned but from what I can tell the ioslicense can be upgraded to ios ?  Also from what I understand going with a Gigabit version isnt necessary though I was eyeballing it as I could incorporate it into my home setup to replace the gigabit HP Procurve I have. ya know to be all Cisco about things.  Though should I just save the money stay with the Procurve and keep focus on just the lab by going with a V?And that is just the switches.  At this time it seems as though the s and the  will be usable for CCNP from what I can find.  Whether or not the s are remains to be seen.  I mean I dont imagine theyll be wasted entirely come CCNP will they?  If so Ill chalk that up to the price of learning.The routers on the other hand well thus farCisco  DF w IOS .T CME . not sure Ill adventure into Voice but CME is there and I believe the  is suitable for Voice if not would this be suitable for CCNACCNP?  The newer versions i.e.  are a little out of my price range for now Im afraid which is too bad as even the xxs appear to be newer than the xx.  And an ISR router seems as though would be a better router to go with.  Is ISR necessary come time CCNP?  Will an ISR be suitable at least for the CCNA?  Ive yet Ill admit to read the definitive differences though Im learning Im getting there.Then there are the modules for the routers.  A few WICDSUTV or ?
