1069044,0,t1_chpsiqt,Fuckin a on the lifting side. Its good to talk to another meathead. I RES tagged you to remember you. I do powerlifting with a bit if bodybuilding. Im on a cut at the moment though. Trying to pull lbs of fat off me. Slow and steady wins this race I guess. You know I thought the same about drinking. What else is there to do? I thought. Theres plenty. Plenty that involves a healthier lifestyle. I take my dog to the park nearly every day and I run around with her. I go to young professional networking groups to meet people mainly women why lie. The networking groups really serve as a replacement for the social aspects of getting shit faced at the bar. I picked up a few different hobbies and met some cool people at some meet ups that are associated with those hobbies. In short when I quit drinking I grew up. I became a more well rounded individual and had other responsibilities aside from nursing a hangover. Its been  months since my last binge drinking session Im doing fine. In fact I can have a few drinks socially and stop myself now. Its amazing how much self control I have in comparison to  months ago.  tabs left and right and now Im a Sally Smirnoff ice kinda guy. Im damn proud of that title I must say! Whats your drink of choice? For me it was whiskeyginger and beer. Im allergic to vodka. Vodka made my knuckles bloody. ,EOOD,chpszj5,1,t5_2zw1d

You should be able to comfortably hold a conversation while doing cardio at moderate intensities.  It will be difficult to do any sort of activity during cardio though.

I had a hunch that if I stayed at the house and tried to fight that feeling I would end up going back to bed or getting stuck in a procrastination cycle and the bad feelings would just build and build..So on a whim I decided to grab my book go down to the bakery eat a croissant drink a cappuccino and read for  minutes.  Getting out of the house was such a nice break.  Even though I came right back home taking that  minute break to have a change of scenery allowed me to distract myself long enough to let my anxiety deescalate and when I got back home I didnt have much trouble accomplishing my tasks for the day.

2869451,0,t3_2syzrd,One step at a time. At least for me I cannot make drastic changes and expect them to stick. Read the FAQ over at rloosit and rfitness I found them both pretty helpful. Try cutting one bad thing out of your diet like soda. If your drinking a lot of soda cut it back to one or two a day until that feels normal. Then switch to one or two a week until that feels normal. Then switch to none. Remember to drink lots of water. Once drinking water only feels normal make another change. The trick is one step at a time until it doesnt feel like work. At some point youll need to start tracking calories. Use a website like my fitness pal they make it easy. Dont go by their recommendations for total calories though. Notoriously unreliable. Use a tdee calculator and try to eat about  caloriesday under for a weight loss of about  lb per week. This is a healthy loss.  there are links to tdee calculators in both the FAQs I mentioned IIRC and there are definitely some in the FAQ on rxxfitness  actually thats a pretty good FAQ overall ignore the fact that youre not a lot. Weightloss is the same for men and women overall. ,EOOD,cnu9a0f,2,t5_2zw1d

3008059,0,t3_2umtc9,This wont help you missing a run but have you ever tried lifting weights?  I too get a high like feeling after a good run but lifting weights is a much more intense mood lifter for me.  In a glass is half full kind of way you can look at it like your addicted to working out which I think is a good thing.  There are many out there that cannot get into a rhythm and eventually quit.  A few years ago I used to crave going to the gym because it felt good and afterwards it put me in a really positive mood.Give it a try.  Of course it wont be an immediate thing so try to work yourself into it slowly but after a couple months you may find it even more addicting than running.,EOOD,co9s6xv,2,t5_2zw1d

It is such a hard question to answer. I know why I do it but deep down they are not asking that. Theyre trying to find motivation for themselves but its different for everyone. I bet if we asked every person why they exercise they will have different answers. Even within this sub which is a niche of mental health and fitness. Still going to have  uniquely different answers. If you have your main answer as To look sexy. Youre going to lose hope long before youve reached that goal. Not everyone will but a lot will.

4122946,0,t3_37vqer,Exercise is only part of it. I subbed to find new suggestions to get over my depression. Still working on it. Its a delicate balance of other aspects of your life as well. Human interaction the sense of achievement a goal or purpose to keep you going a strong getshitdone mentality. Keeping my diet clean and staying physically fit only helps my mind to better deal with depression. A huge portion of it is mental.Theres nothing worse than hitting the gym and feeling like youre getting no where. In your case your position requires you to keep your physical fitness to a high level. The responsibilities that require you to row can be detrimental you might not enjoy it as much compared to a fat guy whos progressively working towards a better body. If youve already got your physical attributes in order then you need to work on your mental coping mechanisms. Beating your body to a pulp isnt going to work. You know this. x per week  hrs per day with only  rest day? How quickly do you think your body is deteriorating at this point? How are your joints and cartilage handling it? Are your muscles fibers able to keep up? If your body is throwing up red flags dont ignore them. At the same time throwing everyone under the bus because you assume that everyone on here uses exercise as an end all be all to depression is also wrong. My point is exercise helps me but I know its not the only thing thats going to get rid of my depression. There are many other factors a majority of them are mental.Try increasing your rest days. I dont know how your rowing schedule is but but I cant push my body without at least  rest day per  workout days. You could probably handle longer days without having to rest but  days straight without a break seems a bit detrimental. Invest in people who you can be around with. Dont use them to whine about your problems use them to maintain your social interaction at least to the bare minimum so you dont feel so excluded from society. You can get through this but you need to look at other areas of your life when one area isnt working. Not trying to be a dick. Just being reasonable and sharing what worked for me.,EOOD,crq8o9r,1,t5_2zw1d

Once youre on the mend very light exercise that doesnt involve the area walking etc will help prevent things getting stiff from inactivity.Im not sure whether heat or cold is recommended for this kind of thing. I think heat? Cold packs didnt help me personally.Edit also for things like this that arent specific to depression maybe ask in one of the other fitnessrelated subreddits?

As this is EOOD going for a run or bike might be more recommended than doing it indoors. Do sprints. Focus on getting stronger first.

Start from scratch and build myself back up.Its important not to compare yourself now to yourself before your illness.

I say go for the membership! There is never any judgement at the gym. Everyones just trying to improve themselves. Find a buddy too to help keep you motivated.However if youre still on the fence about a membership just take time out to go for walks or a run. Go somewhere beautiful and just walk around.

6382462,0,t3_432y7t,You need to calculate your protein intake or you wont be getting close to enough. It makes an absolutely huge difference. A protein shake afterwards isnt going to come close to cutting it. You need about g protein a day.Also what does your routine look like? Are you squatting? Benching? Deadlifting?Are you tracking your sessions at all? Adding ..kg per lift?Are you consistently going?Are you utilising your rest days and getting enough sleep?,EOOD,czf48hk,10,t5_2zw1d
6383142,0,t3_432y7t,Hey man Ive been lifting for a few years now and my results are also what Ive always had to consider subpar. Ive spent those years reading textbooks fitness websites reddit etc. working with multiple personal trainers trying my own ideas and tracking everything meticulously in spreadsheets and online trackers and have been learning all the while. Some people just put on muscle very very slowly. Ive actually put several people on routines and helped them in the same way Ive been working on myself and in every case they made gains faster than me. So for me I know its just going to be a multiyear journey to get to the same place someone else might get to in less than a quarter of the time.I guess Ive probably been lifting on intelligently designed routinesnot counting all the times I was doing dumb stuff when I didnt know better for around  years maybe? In that time Ive grown my arms from  inches to . inches. Talk about extremely underwhelming progress. Ive never seen a single person in real life or in a fitit progress post take more than a year for that and many have done it in  months and on routines that Ive done myself and yielded no results.Anyway feel free to PM me or just ask me questions here if you want some tips from someone else who has been training on hardinsane mode for a while. I can check through your routinedietrecovery to see what isnt currently optimized. First Id want to know what your routine is your daily caloriesprotein and your current rate of weight gain as well as rate of bf increase or stomach circumference increase or just an idea of how much fat you think youre putting on if you eyeball it.Or you can assume that I have no idea what Im talking about since my results have been poorhonestly wouldnt blame you in that case. Id think the same if I were in your shoes!! Haha.Though I actually was in your shoes at your height and weight in  when I had just done  months of SS. I had put on basically no muscle a good amount of fat but had gained more strength then Id ever had in my entire life. I was plateauing so hard on all my lifts and had been for months despite sleeping  hours a night and eating  calories per day wg protein and following the program like a religion. I was so demotivated and physicallymentally exhausted I just quit and gave up. It was only later that I found out almost no one grows on such low volume programs. The moment you start plateauing is when you need to switch as it indicates youve gotten all the quick neuromuscular gains youre going to get and now its time to focus on actual contractile protein gains and other adaptations that increase the size of the muscle cells which is optimized through high volume not low volume high intensity though some people grow on almost literally ANY program with progressive overload which is why youll see positive reviews for any workout program under the sun.,EOOD,czf70pj,2,t5_2zw1d
6472779,0,t3_44a54n,Not entirely relevant but I went to the gym on my own  two days in a row.Usually I need a workout buddy to go with ive been procrastinating about joining a gym since we moved office I work out at lunchBoth times I ran  mins  KM yesterday .KM today but on a steeper gradient my legs are achey and broken but i love it!,EOOD,czotx7e,4,t5_2zw1d
6473303,0,t1_czokz8b,I know quite a few people in the same boat as you then. But not that much harm in eating the same foods for lunch for most of the week.If you need to eat more because you want to gain weight for example you could try to sprinkle more oil coconut olive on your food. Butter would help as well. And I do not want to offend you but understand that eating broccolis are part of the process of becoming more fit and healthy. Almost none of absolutely LOVE eating broccoli but eating veggies every day is just something that needs to be done. In the same way that I do not enjoy most of my hill sprint sessions but I know it is good for me so I suck it up.,EOOD,czovvk4,1,t5_2zw1d

6735738,0,t3_47utgv,Think of yourself as a construction project. You try to build yourself up brick by brick with all the good things in life  meaningful relationships personal achievements a sense of purpose etc. Depression comes along and starts hammering at the structure shaking even the foundation of who you are. It erodes selfesteem and warps selfimage. Problems start to pop up  the workers are too tired to haul bricks the scaffolding collapses. Progress grinds to a halt but the depression presses its attack further worsening the situation because now you are no longer rebuilding what got broken.ampnbspExercise gives you a way to fight back  maybe not against depression itself but as a channel through which you build.ampnbspIt gives you a way to combat negative selftalk Depression tells you Youre fat and lazy and you can answer But Ive run a mile every day for a month now so thats not quite true.ampnbspIt gives you control and power to shape your future. Depression tells you Why bother? Nothing will change and you can answer But things are changing because Im changing them even if it means just starting one healthy habit.ampnbspIt gives you an opportunity to challenge yourself work towards goals and hit milestones. Depression tells you Youre worthless youll never make it nobody believes in you! But you know what when that treadmill reads mile . and your lungs are burning and your legs feel like jelly and your hand is drifting towards hitting that big red STOP button but you dont  you grind out that last mile and celebrate when the display reads .. Doing that time after time builds more than cardio endurance. It builds trust in yourself. You learn that you have the ability to set focus on and reach goals. In fact you start surprising yourself with the new things youre capable of and that opens up a world of possibilities  a new sport youve been too afraid to try making fitness buddies to trade advice with buying that outfit you never thought would look so good on you. Really exercise ought to come with a disclaimer WARNING MAY CAUSE UNFORESEEN SIDE EFFECTS BUT THATS AWESOME.ampnbspFrom what Ive experienced depression is a force of destruction and inertia. It wants to bring everything to zero and I cant always stop its effects but I try to keep building whether that be through exercise or any one of the countless tools for developing oneself. Some days I wake up early and hit the gym. Others I cant get out of bed until evening. Still I know every positive action is a brick in my fortress. For me fitness is a clear marker of progress and its a great feeling knowing that progress is the result of actively constructing myself through exercise.ampnbspSo yeah exercise is pretty sweet.,EOOD,d0g188q,21,t5_2zw1d

9047597,0,t3_546p19,Ok I was in your boat a few years ago. What really helped me was going for walks and looking for any excuse to walk somewhere. Take the stairs as much as you can again with any excuse you can find. Biking really opened up a lot for me since you can pedal for awhile then coast AND you go so much farther than walking. Id go for rides or walks either by myself or with others and it gave me a lot of time to think through things explore wherever I was nature hikes are my favorite and even play tiny madeup games like looking for things that had changed looking for animals or interesting rocks or peopletheir clothesshoes depending on where you live. To be honest just getting out in the fresh air and walking around to either think or explore is the main reason I can get some exercise and mentally unwind.   If you want to advance a little from that after you feel pretty good with those Id recommend weight training. Running is in my opinion the evilest of exercises and I avoid it like the plague. Ill run for a game but sure as hell not to just run...    If you want to advance beyond THAT kickboxing really whipped the shit out of me and I lost a ton of weight with it in a month but it really depends on your trainer. My first trainer worked me so hard I couldnt walk without pain for over a week  he was amazing. My second trainer just left me sweaty and out of breath but didnt demand as such and I didnt loose nearly as much or come back for a loooong time.      As for the eating thing I found changing my thinking from I shouldnt eat this to I dont eat this REALLY helped. I still have control issues with ice cream so I dont have it in my house ever. I treat sweets and my feel good foods as treats only to be eaten once a week tops. Good foods should be your new norm. Try to have something green with every lunch and dinner you can start small but work your way up when you find recipes and combos you like and it gets easier to whip together. If you want some tips and recipes I can give you some. I am super lazy in the kitchen but have found ways to perfect salads and get my goods even through my laziness.   Lastly just try to always view the walks and rides as something to do to unwind and have a bit of fun and you will never see them as work or exercise. Even if you have trouble implementing all of the other things just keep that base and your body and mind will thank you.   PS. Its been years and through constant trail and error I have gone from  to . Do not see this as a quick change and dont be discouraged by that either! The slower it comes off the slower it will come back and the easier it will be to keep low!,EOOD,d7zdkd8,8,t5_2zw1d

I believe that most people are not reaching their fitness goals because of some kind of mental block whether full blown depression or something much smaller.

It makes it a lot easier to train. Congrats so far. Even a little bit of exercise helps my depression quite a bit. Keep it up!,EOOD,dd0tu7z,2,t5_2zw1d

11073149,0,t1_demyvso,I know exactly what you mean. Ive had  different MyFitnessPal accounts I had to make a new email to register! It took my therapist quite a while to convince me to track my calories I didnt want to go back to when I was insanely depressed and restricting myself. I think it is due to the place Im in in my life. When I was at my worst and counting calories I was living with my parents and going a very tough time at school. Ive now moved have an amazing boyfriend and have been in therapy for a year  Whats also helped me is making the most out of those  or so calories you count. I love searching up recipes for cookies brownies and muffins I have a biiiit of a sweet tooth. That way I dont feel like Im restricting myself so much. ,EOOD,den4qlp,3,t5_2zw1d

11210118,0,t1_df2mzkh,Mostly its because I have had a lot of stress lately and my mood has been erratic. So I do not know for sure yet wether this depression season is over or whether I will relapse.Thank you for the good vibes! Ps To clarify further I was depressed in January and February and while the past three weeks have been surprisingly amazingly good given the stress in my life but I guess I do not trust this remission yet.,EOOD,df2nk37,2,t5_2zw1d
11249991,0,t3_60kjwz,Could it have been a positive cry? Like a cry of relief or something? Letting go of some stuff that was bottled up inside you and maybe after a good workout you finally felt like you could let it go and cry? How did you feel after the crying worse or better?Ive had a lot of emotional reactions in all sorts of situations. For example I remember once going for a walk and crying because I realized I had forgotten to have fun for too long and I was crying and telling myself that I would have fun more often from now on.,EOOD,df764r0,4,t5_2zw1d
11258510,0,t3_60onoj,Extremely proud of you for replacing a vice with a virtue. Although you restricted your drinking to weekends addiction could have easily escalated. I think having a habitroutine is helpful for a lot of people and it looks like youve already found the advantages of exercise and focusing on your health. Youre doing great! ,EOOD,df84vmt,13,t5_2zw1d

11458199,0,t3_63jqq6,I havent read the article yet but as for my own experience exercise has helped greatly with dealing with anxiety and dealing with stress although I have been depressed I havent slipped back or allowed myself to. But I try to keep a good balance in life diet friendships exercises work managing my drinking and avoiding situations that chould cause stress theres no magic button.Article saved as I miss reading the Irish times paper Ill pick the article up later.,EOOD,dfus1vn,2,t5_2zw1d

11583558,0,t3_64x2o7,Id be careful with Runners high. It can be addictive. And as I read somewhere a lot of people switch their problems out with that Runners High. Great body broken soul was something I read in a book recently. Its not only constricted to running but fitness in general. There are people who have to work out every day or they feel bad. They made their state of mind dependent on these endorphins their bodies are pouring out after every training. The danger here is that the people who chase this condition will get very unhappy if they wont achieve it. The result is more and of course much harder training. Chances increase dramatically to hurt oneself in the process too. While working out and running are great things its also important to find out where the depression comes from. I just cant put anything like training above it and think everythings gonna be alright just because I feel good now because of endorphins. Kinda hollow victory which wont last. Its nice to have these endorphins but never rely on them solely to get out of depression by themselves. Theres more to that. Body and soul are a unit. I just cant fix one without working on the other.,EOOD,dg904kg,1,t5_2zw1d
