2685047,0,t3_2qmc62,What system are you going to use to watch it?  Here is a quick breakdown of all the ways I watch games.PC  quality is great and action is only a second or  behind live tv.  Hardly ever freezes like once a week.  I have my PC also hooked up to a TV via HDMI and soundvideo is awesome.iPad  quality is great and action is about  seconds behind live tv.  Can freeze sometimes but not very often.  Works great when paired with AppleTV and airplay.  This combination is my favorite.Roku  Quality is good most of the time but can be subpar when other feeds are fine.  Action can be up to  seconds behind sometimes I think is because the thing takes so damn long to load.  Roku app seems to have trouble with feeds quite frequently and I get URL error messages quite frequently.  Ball cast android app and Chromecast  the combo I use the most not sure why.  Quality is excellent and action is usually  seconds behind.  However  the feeds drop all the damn time.  Like multiple times a game.  It seems that once it starts working you are good to go.  BSDroid  great quality and good connections works great if you are watching on just an android device.  Doesnt allow push to chromecast though.   Overall I like the service.  The feeds are too bandwidth heavy for me to connect on just my mobile network the sd feeds will eventually load but its a long wait which sucks if I want to quick watch a game while out and about.  I just wish the Ball Cast app didnt drop so damn much.  I dont actually own an appleTV anymore it was my exs but that worked awesome pushing from iPad via Airplay.  ,BallStreams,cn920j4,2,t5_31l8c
