6020818,0,t1_cy8ot4x,No problem  the update data stays in your dss own memory so even you remove the rom and put it back at a later date it will just automatically update again without you having to do anything. ,SKY3DS,cy8uq86,2,t5_34ax1
6189584,0,t3_40bac1,No its not possible. Youll have to use the regionfree launcher that comes with The Homebrew Launcher in order to do so and setting up homebrew is really easy these days as a new browser exploit was found so all that you need to do is follow the instructions at ,SKY3DS,cyt6vfg,3,t5_34ax1
6263344,0,t3_418ijn,I bought one on the rd of January from them and only  days ago did I finally get an update on it saying it has been shipped. I too was overcharged . I phoned my bank the day after I bought the card and they said I have to wait  days after purchase if no delivery or wait for delivery before I can open a complaint.  days after is tomorrow Monday th Jan and if I dont have it by then Im getting my overcharged amount back. When I questioned them on why I was overcharged  I got these responses As you known flashcarts are not allowed sell in UK of course our sellers cant use the UK local payment gateways to receive the payment we have to use oversea payment gateway so the payment transfer between oversea banks. And they will charge a little transcation fees and shortly after The difference was charged by banki dont know the exact rant.. This sounds like complete bullshit to me and I would urge everyone to buy from a different reseller than SkyDSuk.com,SKY3DS,cz1kmax,1,t5_34ax1
6314344,0,t3_423lct,Bought mine from modchipsdirect as well and it came from Australia too. I had the same hesitations you did about it coming from there especially when they said that it is shipping straight from Asia on the site. But when I got mine everything worked great. I guess there would be no way to tell it was a return with the way the packaging is plus they say they test the cards to ensure they work which means it would be technically used. Also on their website they have this in the FAQBecause of the nature of the product and the fact that we do not have a physical store and we dont sell second hand stuff we cannot under any circumstances refund you for your purchase. If you do not agree with this please DO NOT BUY from us. I am sure you dont want to receive a nd hand product and we must do this to ensure this!,SKY3DS,cz7ddbm,1,t5_34ax1
6611088,0,t3_43f8we,Thanks vmagic but I had done this several times already with no luck. I have managed to get it to work now and was pretty sure it was a problem with the micro SD card itself with another card there was no problems.,SKY3DS,d0354q9,1,t5_34ax1
6622051,0,t3_46djti,. yes you can by using a private header.. yes depending on the region.,SKY3DS,d049zm3,1,t5_34ax1
6674444,0,t1_d09oqnt,Make sure youve got a .ds file for your region. If you grabbed a bunch of Europe .ds files and youve got a DS from the US they wont work. Make sure the download of the file is complete Dont trim the rom. Or maybe you should try to trim the rom. Trimming is probably not the issue but if youre certain of everything else Id give it a try. Also Skyds wont work with homebrew .ds files or those eShop games converted into .ds files. Skyds only plays legit games from your region.,SKY3DS,d09p1jk,1,t5_34ax1
6720644,0,t3_47he4n,There IS a way around it but you need a DS on . or lower which I assume you dont have since you have a SkyDS.But who knows! I have both and even if you dont maybe you have a friend who does.Let me know if you do and Ill be happy to detail for you how to get a header.,SKY3DS,d0eh0xa,1,t5_34ax1

6797921,0,t3_48oq4s, format sd card to fat if its bigger than gb you will need to use special software.    get winrar or your rar unoacker of choice.   download latest firmware on sky website and transfer it to the microsd card take micro sd card out of adapter and put in skyds then plug in to computer.   You should see red light until firmware is done installing then flashing green light meaning its ready to use.    unpack the roms into d files then drag and drop and it should be working correctly,SKY3DS,d0mu4e2,2,t5_34ax1
7050753,0,t3_4c6h83,I made a post very similar to this check it out. A lot of your questions were answered except Powersaves I believe is you can I dont know much about them but I have seen the mentioning of these. gb Micro SD Thats all you need besides the cartridge and a DS Along with a Micro SD adapter to connect to your PC with but I feel as though thats an obvious inclusion. Updating and Playing Online without being banned These are possible with Private Headers more on those in my post. Homebrew is possible through this Cubic Ninja and yes it will work on your old DS XLAnything mentioned in this reply most likely is elaborated on in my post.,SKY3DS,d1fk7j8,0,t5_34ax1
7133982,0,t3_4d9eky,You had better make sure the Pokemon ORAS file is from reliable resource. It seems that it is impossible to replace the save in the way you want.,SKY3DS,d1p1zhs,1,t5_34ax1
7449224,0,t1_d2olzzr,Thats true for many shady products so in a way we all knew what we were getting into.However I thought that the new SkyDS was supposedly easier to use and didnt need all the updates the previous SkyDS needed. That was kind of the point of the upgrade along with breaking the new security and adding Firmware updates for future proofing the product.So if it is still true the SkyDS should run Bravely Second without problem. Oh and theres no updates most likely because theres nothing new to break yet? Im not really following the scene and whatnot but that would be my guess.,SKY3DS,d2oxhbr,1,t5_34ax1
7658663,0,t1_d35fjks,So have you figured out what went wrong?I also have the same problem in my newest ds firmware. And for now I conclude that I have a faulty Skyds.,SKY3DS,d3cqvzt,1,t5_34ax1

10540412,0,t1_dd2vb07,gt what are you maintaining? I havent had to touch anything once cfwing the dsBest practices are to  copy the file structures on the sdmsd to your laptopsafe space  use Hourglass to make system backups sysnand backupsKeep both of those in a safe place in case you have problems with your sdmsd OR system itself.
