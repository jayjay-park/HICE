8334782,0,t3_4tmf7p,. Excellent question. Ive been bothered by this tension too and I dont know the answer. Its possible that the effects of a dump of free stuff are sensitive to things like the existing level of human capital so that newly redundant workers have something productive to do maturity of local industries to absorb them efficiently or something similar.. The effects of aid are really hard to disentangle. For example this  paper by Sebastin Edwards essentially says that the current state of research is incapable of comprehending the effects of aid in a meaningful way. Here is a less technical summary by the author.. Concerns over the potential harm from flooding the market have led to things like capacity building instead of just giving stuff. Heres a related page from USAID. I havent seen Poverty Inc but it sounds like the specific protectionist argument involved is the infant industry argument. You might try emailing Don Boudreaux at Cafe Hayek He loves making the same How could freecheap stuff ever be bad argument and is also critical of US foreign aid. He often blogs responses to lettersemails so perhaps he would respond.Edited to addI just found this old FEE article ! that makes the same point as you describe from the documentarygt One problem with food aid is that the dumping of free food in Third World countries depresses prices for local farmers therefore resulting in less domestic production. According to George Dunlop chief of staff of the Senate Agricultural Committee millions of Indians may have died of starvation because American wheat dumped in India bankrupted thousands of Indian farmers. Thousands of Guatemalan farmers were likewise hurt when food aid poured into the country after the  earthquake. For these unfortunate farmers the price of domestic crops dropped at a time when farmers desperately needed cash to improve and repair their homes. . . . In Bangladesh the upper and middle classes receive free food from foreign aid programs thus impoverishing local farmers with artificially low prices.If US wheat exports led to millions of deaths that is a serious charge indeedmuch worse than the Bangladesh example which looks to me more like the same pecuniary externalities that would happen in any competitive environment.,GoldandBlack,d5jei4j,1,t5_3ffci

8416272,0,t1_d5t45d9,Genetically speaking there is no such thing as race. Its a social construct. Or if you insist on wanting to use the term race the total number of human races from a genetic standpoint is .  of variations occur between individuals.  less then  of variations can be considered group variation. It is not unusually have a person in Germany share more in common genetically with somebody in China then somebody in France or even the next town.  It is all individual and family. That isnt to say that race doesnt matter or doesnt exist in total. Humans are social creatures and social divisions are very significant to us and have significant impact on us. It is possible to use genetics  to divide people into groups but the groups are arbitrary. You want  groups? You can have  groups. You want ? You can have four.  You can have  if you want. The real gotcha is if you divide people into race by genetic variation and you end up with  or  races... all the races end up in Africa.  The rest of humanity from Asian Indians Australian natives Europeans... they are all just one group of Africans. The timeline of human population of earth is a very short one. Less  years. And between then and now there were what seems like several major dieoffs and near extinction events.   The population was reduced to almost nothing several times. Estimates put the entire population of earth have diverged from just  people something along the lines of just  years or so. Estimations differ of course.The result is that compared to most animals humans have almost no genetic variation. Compared to chimps... one tribe of  chimpanzees or so in Africa has more genetic variation then the entire human race. Compared to Canines... Canidaes is the family of doglike creatures.. dogs wolves foxes jackels. Next level on the tree would be genus Canis doglike and the genus Vulpes foxlike. Then Canis is a species. Most animals in Canis should be able to interbreed. Canis is then divided up into subspecies of Jackels  Gray Wolf and Red Wolf. Domestic dog is a subsubspecies of Gray wolf and doesnt really get its own category taxonomy speaking.   Thats about as fine as the animal kingdom gets.Domestic Dog is then further subdivided into different breeds that divided up by size temperament color coat etc etc.   Breeds are largely nonscientific divisions and are tracked by various official kennels that decide the different breeds. You have major groups of breeds like hounds vs toys vs work dogs vs terriers etc. Some dogs have two coats some have one.  Some are big others are small. Some are more active and smarter others tend to be more lazy and dont respond as well to commands. The entire human species has the genetic variation roughly similar to the differences between two related dog breeds.  Like  Doberman Pinscher vs German Pinscher. Now of course depending on how you count things and consider genes..  A common measurement of genetic differences is Fst. Fst between breeds of dogs is .. Fst between groups of humans is .. Its only been relatively recently that we can tests good enough to accurate discern the difference between domesticated dogs and other types of gray wolves. ,GoldandBlack,d5tkskm,1,t5_3ffci

8468505,0,t3_4volgn,Anarchocapitalism is not going to come about on its own. Anarchocapitalists must strategies to bring about anarchocapitalism. There are though two kinds of strategies political strategies and apolitical strategies.The primary apolitical strategy of anarchocapitalism is agorism the participation in the informal economy instead of the formal economy thus starving the state of tax dollars which also includes homesteading seasteading countercommunities and plenty of other antistate somewhat illegal strategies. Everyone is a countereconomist to some degree we must educate people to embrace the agorism that they already practice.The political strategy is of course voting campaigning and appealing to the government to shrink the power of the government. You bring up a fair point when you saygtAnd if no libertyminded people voted wouldnt this mean the statists would always get a majority in elections?I agree with this. It is important for us to embrace political and apolitical strategy to bring about anarchocapitalism. We must vote for the candidates who are most likely to embrace liberty. We must get libertarians into political office that much is obvious. We cannot only practice agorism as the state becomes more and more authoritarian.There is nothing wrong with voting. There is however a problem with voting for authoritarians and statists. If you choose to vote vote for someone who actually cares about liberty and not for the leastworst of the twoparty system.If a person chooses not to vote in favor solely of agorism and other apolitical strategies that is perfectly fine too. But even if you resent voting if a libertarian has a serious chance to take political power I would highly recommend even the staunchest antivoter to vote just this one time so we can reverse the trend of authoritarianism that the world seems to be diving into headfirst.,GoldandBlack,d603opm,12,t5_3ffci

The pragmatic ancap line would in my opinion be to secede the smaller the political unit is the bigger becomes the incentive for the state to adopt international commodity monies to adopt free trade policies and to be comparatively nicer and wiser towards its population because of the risk of losing its tax base when the tax base can vote with their feet against policy. You can also secede and form polycentric societies.gtSo if you are a American and advocating for national defense as part of minimal government you are actually advocating that the state has the right to expand its size and scope on a asneeded basis. You are claiming that not only must the state kill people on behalf of the nation but that it must also kill people for its own benefit because without the political structure ie the state there is no national defense.What does being an American have to do with this? What does being an american and advocating for national defense have to do with pragmatism?gtSo pragmatic libertarianism instead of being in opposition to expansion and invasiveness of state power it actually justifies it. It is very difficult for them to advocate for smaller government without being apologists for the current one.I really do not see how secession justifies expansion and invasiveness of state power.gtAnd the kicker the thing that pragmatic libertarianism ignores completely is that the state is not the least bit interested in actually minimizing its own scope and size. The state works for the state. The state does not work for you nor the voters nor anybody else but themselves.Why would pragmatic libertarianism entail the state minimizing itself?

Similar to how you have to help somone if you accidentally push them in the sea or something.Well the similarity is not that obvious to me. The child did not exist before it was conceived. Therefore saying that you caused something to it is not something that you even define properly. You cause something to who? It did not exist before. Someone started existing in a state where he is dependent upon you but you cant say that going from non existence to a bad existence is a worse fate.

10249654,0,t1_dc3akyh,Keep this in mind The USA Bill of Rights lasted about  years before it was demolished with the Alien and Sedation Act.  BackgroundOne of the main appeals of the USA federal government was due to a pretty much false flag event involving a tax protest involving some farmers.  The protest itself was real but proFederalist propagandists latched onto it massively inflated the events in their news papers and even staged some other events to make it look like people were about ready to revolt on the States governments.The States were having a difficult time because they had a hard time paying off the revolutionary war debt and the people were fuming under increased tax pressure.  Essentially the people you are trying to tax to pay things off are the people that you owe for fighting and are the people that managed to kick out the most powerful military of their time. Needless to say they were sweating over this and was looking for a way out.The creation of the Federal government offered them that out.  The Hamilton economic policy involved special government bond schemes that promised to simultaneously pay off the war debt for all the states while making the people who bought the bonds extremely wealthyier in the process. Once the Federal government was established and George Washington was elected he appointed Hamilton to develop the new economic scheme for the country under the new Federal government. Hamiltons economic polices and goals like the central banking system remain in force to this day. His policies formed the basis for modern American cronyCapitalism.The st amendment lasted about  years. Which do you suppose was the most important thing for the people running the country? Protecting the rights of the people or protecting their own power base and economic controls? It should be pretty obvious to anybody at this point that the real purpose of the Federal govenrment is economic not national defense or protecting the constitution or any such nonsense.  Anything other then establishing economic controls is purely secondary and is only done in support of the first. ,GoldandBlack,dc5us40,1,t5_3ffci

10451079,0,t1_dcspuea,Spooner did not view profit as a form of theft. Spooner was against whats now called corporatism or the political means  as opposed to the economic means  Proponent of stateless capitalism. Views on economics and selfemploymentEditSpooner believed that it was beneficial for people to beselfemployedso that they could enjoy the full benefits of their labor rather than having to share them with an employer. He argued that various forms of government intervention in the free market made it difficult for people to start their own businesses. For one he believed that laws against high interest rates or usury prevented those withcapitalfrom extending credit because they could not be compensated for high risks of not being repaid If a man have not capital of his own upon which to bestow his labor it is necessary that he be allowed to obtain it on credit. And in order that he may be able to obtain it on credit it is necessary that he be allowed to contract for such a rate of interest as will induce a man having surplus capital to loan it to him for the capitalist cannot consistently with natural law be compelled to loan his capital against his will. All legislative restraints upon the rate of interest are therefore nothing less than arbitrary and tyrannical restraints upon a mans natural capacity amid natural right to hire capital upon which to bestow his labor...The effect of usury laws then is to give a monopoly of the right of borrowing money to those few who can offer the most approved security.Spooner also believed that government restrictions on issuance of private money made it inordinately difficult for individuals to obtain the capital on credit to start their own businesses thereby putting them in a situation where a very large portion of them to save themselves from starvation have no alternative but to sell their labor to others and those who do employ others are only able to afford to pay far below what the laborers could produce than if they themselves had the necessary capital to work with.Spooner said that there was a prohibitory tax  a tax of ten per cent.  on all notes issued for circulation as money other than the notes of the United States and the national banks which he argued caused an artificial shortage of credit and that eliminating this tax would result in making plenty of money available for lendingsuch that All the great establishments of every kind now in the hands of a few proprietors but employing a great number of wage labourers would be broken up for few or no persons who could hire capital and do business for themselves would consent to labour for wages for another.,GoldandBlack,dcsq8w6,1,t5_3ffci

Statists have captured the history textbooks given to every child in an American public school so they can read a romanticized narrative of democracy and the benefits of big government. This is epitomized when they cover the industrial revolution and the Robber Barons. The cliche is that the capitalists exploited the workers and forced them to work in deplorable conditions while eliding the fact that the employment conditions were voluntary and that wages exploded over this period as well along with literacy life expectancy etc. Then you get to The Great Depression which historians handwave as the event that proves the free market cannot be trusted while eliding its actual root cause and the ineffectiveness of the New Deal.

Its just the thing you point to when you knock someone over the head for stealing your stuff. Thats the great thing about it. You can make moral grandstands about selfownership or you can point to the incentives involved with claiming all of the fruits of your labor. They both lead to the same place.The problem I have is with people who complain about how the NAP isnt relevant as if the number of people who care about an idea in any way affects its objectivity or accuracy. Because no one believes you can keep murderers and robbers away simply by preaching. You can tell because the NAP itself observes when force is justified. The ironic thing is that preaching economic truths is no more effective than preaching consistent moral intuitionism how I view the NAP.

10940779,0,t1_de8du73,gtIf you could give me an example of how a mainstream economist proves their assertions? I am curious by what exactly Austrian economists are lacking.A mainstream economist proves assertions by constructing formal proofs They clearly state their axioms and then they carefully show step by step by using valid rules of inference how the result is implied by the axioms.I will give you an example of a simple semiformal just to make it easier to read here microeconomic proof. I will prove that an agents ordinal preferences must be rational in order to be represented by a utility function. Or equivalently that an agents preferences cannot be represented by a utility function if they arent rational.Sven has ordinal preferences over alternatives goods services etc.Definition X is a set containing all possible alternatives. X could be finite or infinite it doesnt mater in this case.Definition R is a binary relation such that for any alternatives x and y in X xRy if and only if Sven thinks x is at least as good as y.Definition R is complete if for all alternatives x and y in X either xRy yRx or both. Meaning Svens preferences are complete if for any two alternatives either one of the alternatives is better than the other or they are equally good.Definition R is transitive if for all alternatives xy and z in X xRy and yRz imply that xRz. Meaning If x is at least as good as y y is at least as good as z then x is at least as good as z too. In other words Sven doesnt have paradoxical cyclical preferences. If he prefers a banana to an apple and an apple to an orange at the moment he is doing the evaluation then it shouldnt be the case that he thinks a banana is worse than an orange. Definition R is rational if it is complete and transitive.Definition A utility function U is a function an injective function which maps X to the set of real numbers. In other words it is a function assigning every alternative in X a number.Definition A utility function U represents R if UxUy if and only if xRy. Meaning U represents R if it orders all the elements in X in the same way. x gives higher utility than y if and only if x is preferred to y.Axiom U represents R.Lemma  R is complete.Proof A Since U is an injective function either UxUy or UyUx for any alternatives x and y in X. I.e. since U assigns any alternative a number and a number is always either greater smaller or equally large when compared to another number.Since U represents R Statement A implies that either xRy or yRx for all x and y in X. Hence R is complete. QED.Lemma  R is transitive.Proof Suppose that xRy and yRz.B Since U represents R it must be true that UxUy and UyUz. C Since Ux Uy and Uz are real numbers Statement B implies that UxUz.Since U represents R Statement C implies that xRz. Hence R is transitive. QED.Theorem R is rational.Proof By Lemma  and Lemma  R is both complete and rational. Hence R is rational.Interpretation  If any utility function represents some preferences R then R must be rational.Interpretation  Preferences must be rational if they are to be represented by a utility function.Incorrect interpretation Rational preferences can be represented by utility functions.gtThe narrative mentioned above.I do think you are right that Austrians arent the only ones to blame. Lots of empirical mainstream economists buy into this narrative as well completely forgetting theoretical economics. What matters is that the narrative is false regardless of who is telling it.,GoldandBlack,de8gq5w,1,t5_3ffci

Fascism is a darwinian not scientific domination cult dedicated to fostering elitist exterminators. Just like the cancer of communism can not survive without the very wealthy to attack fascism can not survive without constantly increasing the level of looting and degrading by fixinggetting rid of one weak group and then spreading the struggle to include a new group that is considered weak. For fascism this means constant extermination of anyone whom the absolute authorities can afford  or realistically due to social pressures even if they cant afford it  to consider weak and therefore a cost to societythe highest represant of supposedly the strongest man in society.

Its sort of like trying to speed up travel by calling cars airplanes passing a law against gravity and paying for a bunch of useless ground control towers.

11790096,0,t1_dgwfv9d,I disagree. The point of the article is that we are better off than billionaires of .You have fixated on the word rich and argued that we arent as rich as billionaires of  because your super specific definition of rich requires the rich person to aquire satisfaction through inequality. ,GoldandBlack,dgwg3rx,3,t5_3ffci
11793246,0,t1_dgwsh86,gtIf I arrange some electronic parts into a highpower laser and shine it on your property thereby damaging itAre you kidding? Youre physically harming my property by bombarding it with a weapon. Of course youve violated property rights. gtI have a stream going through my property which I use as a water supply. You acquire some property upstream and dam or divert the stream away from my land.This is an entirely different unrelated question. Happy to discuss but Im not going to allow you to change the topic without finishing this first one. gtIs it not a violation of my previously homesteaded property right to this frequency in this area?No because the EM spectrum cant be claimed as property.  Do you have any concept of what a Public good is? ,GoldandBlack,dgwsynm,0,t5_3ffci
11796648,0,t1_dgwege5,gt I very much doubt you truly believe that. I think you are taking me out of context. I did not say in general. I said with respect to ethics and politics. There simply is no completely consistent theory of those disciplines. I have repeated many times that in general consistency should be highly valued. But that is in general. When it cannot be attained we should be fine with the next best thing.gt there are some problems that are arcane obscure andor insolubleI gave you examples that are from the foundations of science that dont meet these criteria. You could debate the insoluable aspect but that is highly debateable. e.g. many people accept and believe that the collapse of the wavefunction is just the way nature is and the fact that it appears as an inconsistency in our theories is seen as just the way things are not grounds for panic or scrapping the theory.I believe that it is you who have been lead astray by accepting on faith the doctrine of internet philosophers who claim consistency without demonstrating it and brush off and ignore the countless counterexamples that have been presented to them about the inconsistency of their beliefs.,GoldandBlack,dgx6uyh,0,t5_3ffci
