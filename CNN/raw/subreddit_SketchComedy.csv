3264159,0,t3_2xgrco,the intro with JFK was very funny. I enjoyed that. But the actual chug of the nuggets was very boring. It was just a sped up video of a guy eating a bunch of mcnuggets I dont know how youd expect an audience to be laughing at that. Also when it says chug  mcnuggets I assumed he would be drinking them somehow Ive never heard the term used for eating. Really after the JFK part I didnt even grin at it. Sorry if this comes off as harsh its just my feedback. ,SketchComedy,cp0cbgb,1,t5_2r1yk

7111630,0,t3_4cqxea,I like parts of this but the premise doesnt hold up to scrutiny. It starts out being about how a few hours after youre done eating youre full again. The solution isnt a food that keeps you full longer you just eat it for five hours. It seems like it started as a five hour energy joke but it obviously isnt referencing that at all. Since it isnt a parody of anything and it doesnt really have any message other than heres some people eating an oversized sandwich it doesnt really go anywhere. For example in the beginning of the sketch there is a lot of time spent talking about the ill effects of hunger. This is supposed to be an advertisement but the positive effects of being full arent discussed. This could have had substance if a little more time was spent on the premise but honestly oversized sandwiches on their own arent very funny. Everyones done them.  ,SketchComedy,d1mhpdq,1,t5_2r1yk
