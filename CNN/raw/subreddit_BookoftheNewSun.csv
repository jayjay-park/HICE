9861777,0,t3_5fsays,Ive read this book  times over the last  years and also just finished listening to the audio book which I highly recommend even if you have already read the book. Each time I read this book I discover so much more that I didnt realise the first time round but am still left wondering what the book is actually about.Regarding his parentage. I had the impression Dorcas was actually his mother. Could the bartender be his brother? OTOH there are many hints throughout the book that Severian is from some kind of noble blood mainly due to his height. And in this chapter None of us knows his descent. Each would be an exultant if he could. He then goes on to explain that torturers apprentices are drawn solely from the children of those who fall into our hands. So the implication is that his mother was tortured and killed by the torturers. Or his father..  or perhaps both his parents. If one parent is killed but the other parent remains free wouldnt the child remain in the other parents custody? It also follows that the master torturers must know who his parents were. Severian doesnt ask them even after he becomes Autarch and meets again with Master Paleomon.MausoleumTwo empty coffins lay on the floor. Three more too heavy for me to shift and still intact waited on the shelves along one wall. So the dead man is in one of these three intact coffins which is also closed. Neither the closed coffins nor the open ones constituted the attraction of the place.My picture is of three coffins containing dead bodies lying on shelves with some kind of window on the coffin lid through which you can see the face of the dead person inside. The dead bodies are preserved somehow by some future technology. Severian then goes on to say I longed to know if he too had dark hair. Why can he see the straight nose deepset eyes and sunken cheeks but not the hair???Are these all coffins of previous Autarchs who have travelled to the stars to attempt to redeem mankind as discussed in Book ? And from how long ago? The description of the necropolis implies these are in an old section of the cemetery. Or is he looking at himself with some kind of time travel  time going backwards theme that is hinted at in Book ? Or is there some reason that the Autarchs all look similar? I still dont understand this part.He also says when describing the Necropolis the Autarchs were not buried there even when the Citadel was their stronghold. Which implies these are not Autarchs at all.The other question is why were the two coffins opened and presumably pillaged? Drowning in the GyollI said I saw Malrubius. An old man a boatman from his tarstained clothes took Roche by the shoulder. Whos that? Used to be Master of Apprentices. Hes dead. Not a woman?I think the woman is one of the giant underwater women Undines he dreams of then later meets after leaving the House Absolute. The implication as I understand it is that the boatman saw the Undine somehow. The boatman doesnt seem particularly phased that he just saw a giant underwater woman in the river. gt Is Severian referring to people of high descent being handed over to the guild for torture or as boys that grow up to be torturers? The apprentice torturers are all children of clients the torturers guild as he mentions earlier in the chapter. This drowning scene is also the first of many times Severian has dreams  visions of Master Malrubius.Some other world building stuff hereThe curtain wall our guild was to help defend was ruinous even then with a wide gap between the Red Tower and the Bear where I used to climb the fallen slabs of unsmeltable grey metal. The fallen slabs of unsmeltable grey metal are parts of the curtain wall made of some indestructable alloy. Although for some reason thouhh unsmeltable parts of this wall have still fallen down.It is odd that the first two chapters are in reverse chronological order. I cant see any obvious reason it was written that way.,BookoftheNewSun,dat0glk,1,t5_3hgt1
