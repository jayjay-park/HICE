6339,0,t1_cef1nf7,Youre right. I feel very small very helpless. This is the root of my apathy of my resignation. Ironically I used to be quite the opposite very convinced that I could help turn the tide we see coming. But thats how entropy works.I fully intend to pull myself out of insolvency as it is directly hampering my ability to enjoy what remains of my youth. Years of my life have been lost to an empty wallet it is pathetic and intolerable. I just wish I knew where to start...Prior to the past few months I was the most selfeffacing downtoearth wallflower youd ever meet. Used to be a real nice guy. So per your instructors advice I need to change that in order to achieve different results. Ive suspected this to be the case for some time. For months Ive been working on my fitness working to become more aggressive to take more risks to become what society demands of a man. Hopefully these attributes will bear better fruit than those which humiliated me so deeply in the past.,selfimprovement,cef5ppa,-1,t5_2qmbm

We have every intention to get back together she just felt emotionally drained because I have this same problem among a few others.Im working very hard to fix these problems not for her but for myself. Because I see that she is right and I want a better way of living for myself.Being emotionally dependent and constantly seeking approvalaffectionattention is one of the hardest things Ive ever tried to get myself to stop doing. Until I got a puppy. I know he wont be around forever but for now he serves as a fantastic reminder that I dont need the affection and attention of others because I have his utmost love and affection. He is ALWAYS happy to see me. I repeat ALWAYS. When Im upset I have him to talk to. We can play frisbee or fetch or ride longboards or just chill. He is always there for me when Im feeling emotionally dependent and this has helped ten fold.It may not work for you.

When I am at the grocery store I always chat with the cashier to keep in practice. I usually start with something like Wow looks like its busy in here today. They always respond. No not as bad as the weekend that was really busy. Then I follow up as if that were the most fascinating thing I ever heard. Really? I would have thought Mothers Day weekend would be quiet with everyone going out to dinner. But that wasnt the case? No lots of people had cookouts so we were busy till about  p.m. Oh my gosh that late?   And so on. Sometimes you have to fake it.

However there are a lot of exercises to improve that. Specially there are fun ones.The most effective tool I found was the Dual Nback exercise. You can download it for pc or cellphone and after a very short time of practice my short span memory improved dramatically. However to my taste its quite boring and I need something that is funnier.Other games like memoryfocused board games or other simple memory videogames also help a lot.

I also dont want to make any assumptions about you only based on what you have said here. I will say that its good you are on this sub and looking to make improvements in your life. I would suggest that in addition to your self  education efforts you search for a job even if its a parttime position that doesnt pay great. Networking and exposure to real world issues are things you will only get from getting out there and working. Learning is useful but only in conjunction with real world application. Its highly unlikely that someone can just amass knowledge and then land an ideal job. I know it seems Im going off on a tangent but having some form of employment even if its menial may be something that could bring some regularity to your schedule and help you be more productive.

1986612,0,t3_2hgylb,Yeah this used to happen to me a lot and Im finding now that on the whole Im a much more empathetic person who enjoys being around people and really cares about their lives.What I did was write out a physical numbered list of traits I wanted in the present tense. e.g. I am a warm friendly wellliked person. I put people at ease and am sincerely interested in them.I have a lot of goals on my list but you dont need a lot just the ones you want the most. Every morning the first thing I do is go to a quiet place and read each goal aloud or at least move my lips and after saying each one I take a minute to really visualize each one happening. Get into it. A lot of the problem is consistency because everyone can be empathetic sometimes but all the time is hard. You can summon up the feelings from a time when you truly felt like your goal. If you cant visualize a particular one dont beat yourself up about it. Move on to the next one. Do this every morning and every night too. I miss a day or night sometimes. It happens. It was hard to believe at first this would have any effects I will say. I think I finally do understand why it does work  now though. Embodying a trait is all about trends would you consider yourself an empathetic person when you act that way  of the time? What about ? ? Eventually it just kinds of creeps up on you if you envision yourself doing it enough. I am a good guitar player but when I started I wasnt. I just became a little better every day....and there was really  no clear deliniation where you could say okay now Im good. I just kept becoming good.

2118893,0,t3_2j75ot,I can only speak to my own experiences but maybe it will be helpful.I realized that I was most judgemental when I was unhappy with myself. I was holding myself up to very high standards and when I couldnt meet those standards Id get upset. This would manifest as me holding others up to the very same high standards then judging them for not meeting them. Id project my feelings of inadequacy and frustrations on others.Once I accepted myself and my shortcomings as a natural part of the human condition I began to realize that other people are allowed to have short comings as well. Additionally in the process of figuring out what works best for me I realized that other people are trying to find out what works best for them and that not everyone will have the same solution.There are many ways to live life.

I had this idea in my head that I had to sculpt a better version of myself as soon as possible no slacking allowed. Turns out by doing that I was stressing about my hobbies nearly as much as about my everyday duties.Nowadays I try and do things differently. I try and sketch out as clearly as possible what I want to achieve in the near future say read a couple of books and every time I have the time to do something I ask myself what I feel like the most that particular day. Is it book A or book B? Neither allright maybe relax a bitt by figuring out that new song you wanted to learn. Or feeling the itch because youve been sitting on your ass the entire day maybe a run will do you some good.So I might not read one book per week but at least it wont turn into a chore either and I actually can derive some value from it other than simply having done that thing.

Thrift stores yard sales and even the library often sell books for less than  a piece. The more you read the more youll build your knowledge base critical thinking skills and discover new things.Listen to people  People love to talk about themselves and what they love to do. Youll become exposed to all sorts of hobbies skills experiences topics view pionts philosophies etc. Dont judge just listen. Surf good websites  parts of reddit stumbleupon Khan Academy and TED can expose you to fascinating topics. Youtube has a ton of tutorials and free fulllength documentaries on any topic imaginable. Find something and just follow the suggested links. Documentaries are a great way to get a working knowledge of a topic quickly and in a fascinating way.Try new things  push your boundaries dont say no go out and see the world country state city whatever. But go out. Hike a trail. Go to a museum. Visit a car show. See a play. Try new restaurants. Going to Europe was one of the most transformative experiences of my life. I discovered and developed new interests simply through visiting museums battlefields and castles. I discovered a passion for beer in Belgium and wine in France.In short put yourself out there. If you find yourself with a free weekend go somewhere. If you find yourself with people ask them about their pasttimes. If you find yourself with a few hours read a book or watch a documentary. Eliminate the things from your life that contribute nothing to your personal development. Fill the void with new experiences and learning. ,selfimprovement,co666d9,5,t5_2qmbm

3302154,0,t1_coq1qhw,He actually let me borrow this and told me to read Chapters  and  titled The Pathological Critic and Disarming the Critic respectively. Even though those two chapters only comprise of  pages they really hit hard at the core problems related to raising your selfesteem and you definitely get your moneys worth after reading. Ill try to summarize what I learned but if I were you Id definitely look into picking up a copy.The pathological critic is the negative inner voice that attacks you and even though everyone has a critical inner voice an individual with low selfesteem as a more vicious and vocal pathological critic. The first thing you need to do to disarm the critic is being able to identify when hes influencing you. You might realize that he only comes in certain situations or perhaps hes with you all the time. Once youre able to catch him you can get to work so to speak. Once you do that you need to start unmasking his purpose. When you unmask him you start to expose his true purpose and functions. Some ways to unmask himselftalk Youre kicking me right now to force me to live by the rules I grew up with Youre telling me they wont like me so that I wont be hurt if Im rejected.This one is going to sound a little strange but its helped me. The Howitzer Mantras are designed to help you talk back to him. Examples include STOP THIS SHIT! THESE ARE LIES MY FATHER TOLD ME SHUT UP!Another way of disarming him is to determine the cost of the critic. Where in your life has he hindered you? Did you lose friendships because of him? Does he make you feel anxious and nervous around people? Are you afraid to try new things because of him? Do you lose commission money because he makes you less assertive in front of clients?This one is tricky but its important to be able to affirm your worth. Understand that you are a living breathing human being with an ability to perceive and experience. That is in and of itself very beautiful. The value of your life is that you exist a complex miracle of creation. You were born into a unique set of problems but yet you endured. You dont deserve to be pushed around. I feel pain I love I try to survive I am worthwhile because I breathe and feel and am aware.I got most of this info straight from the book I linked above. To be honest this type of stuff really does help me out. I find that when I repeat those statements in my mind it makes me feel like I have more power in my life and that theres more to look forward to.

3626305,0,t3_31wgb0,I dont know of any books that are specifically geared toward relationships. The book How to Win Friend and Influence People is referenced a lot in this subreddit as a great book on how do develop social skills. Id start there.  I think in any relationship what MOST people are looking for is mutual respect. And that also means they want a partner with SELFrespect because if you dont respect yourself you cant ask others to and it creates a really bad cycle. You dont respect yourself partner feels weird about it and withdraws you cant bear it so you bend over backwards to try to please them partner feels odd and unhappy with your overcompensating they question their own self respect  What kind of person would be with someone like this? and it all breaks down.  Selfesteem comes from the SELF. No relationship could ever give it to you. So work on yourself in all ways by engaging in esteembuilding activities that make you feel good about yourself and making choices that make you feel good about yourself and reflect your values. Maybe one of those esteembuilding actions is to forgive yourself for past issues with the understanding that you are not going to be that person in the future.  Be the person you feel is worthy of the person you want a relationship with. ,selfimprovement,cq5mjt4,3,t5_2qmbm

I guarantee if I do that for a month Ill have at least a couple of publishable pieces as a foundation.It reminds me of a pastor when I was younger who said if time is a problem just read the Bible for thirty seconds a day because everyone can spare that much time.

If you love someone with one hundred percent of your being than it stops being love and starts being obsession and obsession is never healthy. That being said I believe the actual definition of love should be that you will give the other person forty percent. They may be the most important person in your life but you still have a life. The majority of people who fall in love with someone fall because they like the other persons personality physical appearance habits etc. Few peopleexcluding the narcissists and those insert expletive red pill people want a slave but when you love someone with all of your being thats what youre giving them. ,selfimprovement,csoytv9,1,t5_2qmbm

4928302,0,t3_3iek5y,I think that you might be conflating dating with relationships. The whole point of dating is to put yourself out there to meet new people and potentially find someone you want to get to know a little better  someone to have a relationship with. As long as you are honest with the people you are dating and being clear that youre dating not in an exclusive monogamous relationship theres absolutely nothing wrong with this. And even relationships themselves can be very different from one another. Just because your friends are in longterm monogamous relationships doesnt mean that you have to be in that kind of a relationship. An open honest friends with benefits type of situation is still a relationship and if its a good one the two people involved still care about each other and hopefully discuss what they want from the relationship and boundaries etc. But you say you want to change. You are young. Perhaps before you enter into a serious longterm relationship with someone if that is what you wanthow you want to change continue to date meet a lot of people and decide just what it is you are looking for in a partner and from a relationship whatever kind of relationship it might be. ,selfimprovement,cufr2lq,3,t5_2qmbm

5726035,0,t3_3tcov4,Hey man it sounds like youre going through a tough time right now. It says a lot that you are looking inward rather than lashing out on the people around you. Im also a college student that has struggled with some negativity towards others. One thing that helped me was taking  minutes every morning and meditating. Im not sure how familiar you are with it and I certainly thought it was a bunch of woowoo BS when I first read about it but I quickly realized the power it has. Basically it helped me CONTROL what I was thinking about. I learned how to actively filter out thoughts that I knew would be detrimental to my mindset. I would reccomend downloading a free app called Calm which will take you through a week of guided sessions. The idea is that you cannot expect to view the world as a positive place if you cannot cultivate a mindset that is conducive to it. It takes work but it is a habit that WILL help. I promise. Another step you can take is to make it a habit to make eye contact with people while walking to and from class try and have as warm of body language as you can and find one thing you like about the person you pass. All this can happen in a split second and you dont even need to talk to the person but actively practicing finding the good in people and situations can be a practice that will improve your mindset. I hope this helped! College is a great time to become who you want to be but it takes some work. But trust me it is worth it when you become that person.

6457931,0,t3_442ts1,Hey!Ok so this might vary depending on where you live but Im pretty sure most therapists unless they are very nichespecialized dont need a referral. You dont have to go through your doctor you should be able to contact their practice directly. So then its just a matter of finding them! If youre in school you could see if they have mental health resources. If not there might be some kind of mental health center or something in your town a quick search should be able to pull up a few things. Oh and a quick tip for when you do start seeing a therapist dont be embarrassed to switch if you find that whoever youre seeing just doesnt click with you. Thats cool. As for your boyfriend well that could be a bit tough. My ex had some problems with eating disorders and anxiety and although I loved her I will admit it did sometimes get tiring. However! This doesnt mean that I wasnt willing to work through those things and Im sure the same is true for your boyfriend. I think that its really important that when youre calm you try to let him know that you appreciate him being there for you etc. Just a little reassurance should be good.  Try not to take it personally when he gets frustrated. He cares about you for sure and hes probably frustrated with the situation and the fact that he cant help as much as he likes. I cant really say much about your social anxiety but when you find a therapist they can definitely help you with that. Two small tips might be first of all remember that chances are very slim anyone is paying attention to what you are wearing or anything like that. What do you do when you walk around? Youre on your phone thinking to yourself or worrying about others. And thats exactly what everyone else does too p also try to smart small and build up. Really small like next time you go out try to smile and make eye contact with one person. Eventually you could make small talk and soon after talking on the phone would be a piece of cake.Best of luck!!,selfimprovement,cznaknh,1,t5_2qmbm

However the best kind of selfworth imo comes from doing things that benefit others. That could be as simple as working in a charity shop or assisting with kids as the other commenter mentioned however this is quite difficult for someone without relevant experience andor education and a CRB check   at least in my country or even helping out in admintechnicalcomputerydocumentationy stuff of some older companies  a unique benefit you can offer by being younger.If you want to work on your social skills get a job at a bar or a restaurant. Theres probably a bunch of other similar jobs you could do but nothing forced me to learn how to interact with people better than working in bar service.If you want to improve your health or weight get a factory job and work hard at it. Its easy to stay overweightunderweightunhealthy if you slack it off shifting boxes but if you use that time like a gym membership it will pay off for you. If you want to experience more of the world or country at least get a job driving a truck.. aeroplane tanker delivery van. Truck drivers can spend days and days on the road.. sounds idyllic to me.

If you have the time and opportunity to pick and choose a little take it.If youre quite young and just getting going I reckon any job is better than no job. I think human beings need responsibility of more than just themselves in life in order to grow and thrive. Whatever you do dont be afraid to throw yourself into an opportunity especially new ones  you dont get something youve never had without going places youve never been.

That eventually you will be outed and discovered as a fraud.What you are experiencing is more akin to Body Dysmorphic Disorder BDD. While you describe liking yourself in the mirror that doesnt disqualify you from having BDD. You can still know that you are health and FEEL physically healthy but hate your body. BDD led me down a path of selfdestructive and social anxiety  behavior that I didnt recognize until I started speaking to a professional. For Example  My eating was disordered because I felt misshapen when I ate food in social settings. So I would just try to not eat at all.  I avoid mirrors and reflections like the plague unless Im in my house where I actually feel good looking at my body.  I would hide in my clothes. The baggy sweaters  sizes too large to cover my arms and stomach.  I would constantly compare parts of my body to others in public. Id silently watch a person go by in shorts and wonder if my thighs actually jiggled like theirs? Do my upper arms have a flabby curve to them that makes it look like I could take off and fly like a Sugar Glider across town? The worst habit that I have had since around the time I started to feel shitty about my body is excessive skin picking. I am working on it but for the last  years I pick my finger cuticles and sides so much every day that they are raw and bloody. Ive tried every solution I could find to reduce it  excessive moisturising gloves having a friendspouse be a spotter so when they see me doing it they tell me to stop. Its gotten better but its still a huge issue for me. I didnt even know this was a symptom of dysmorphia  I had done it since I was a kid so thought it was just habit or stress.I have been seeing a therapist for BDD as well as an eating disorder since last October. Its been a rocky road but I have found it at the very least helpful to discuss with someone a neutral party what this feels like and try to root out the why. I hope this helps? At the very least start looking at speaking with a professional maybe one who specializes in BDD and can help you identify the signsroot cause.,selfimprovement,d3axqyj,1,t5_2qmbm

I used to compare myself to everyone else wondering why I was such a negative piece of shit good for nothing worthless etc. Then I went through a phase where I realized that I wasnt that bad and I definitely shouldnt be comparing myself to others.Seriously when I realized most people dont care about what I do or what others do it felt freeing. So what if you do something stupid? So what if you embarrass yourself? That doesnt matter in the long run especially if youre around people you will never see again.Also another nihilistic point of view I have adopted is that rarely anyone really matters. But ultimately it us up to myself to make things matter.Like I said its up to you to make yourself matter to yourself because you are owed nothing from anyone else. Anxiety sucks negativity sucks and there are many moments when Im alone at the end of the day and it seeps in. But I get up and throw it away I realize that those emotions are a waste of time if I plan on being around longer.Make goals.Seriously make goals. Ill argue that goals are the  depression killer unless you have a legit chemical imbalance because it keeps your mind busy and working towards something. For me? Right now Im going to the gym losing weight and watching what I eat. I want to be at the weight Ive made a goal of by the end of the year. Sure Im fat and have almost no upper body strength at the moment but who cares? Im working on that.After I figured out my own personal issues with viewing others making personal growth goals have helped immensely with getting bored anxious and depressed.I also had the issue of being pissed off by people that didnt agree with me. Not to an extreme point but I walled myself off from people that didnt agree with me. Not only was this thought process horrible for myself it alienated me from any form of relationship. Once I realized that everyone is just a person and that theres more than likely something we have in common because Im a person too things became easier. I too struggle with making new friends its a lot of work. Im lucky that I have a few childhood friends that stuck around.Dunno if any of this makes much sense or is helpful but felt like sharing some personal insight into what Ive done to help myself. Im not doing perfect but nobody really ever does.,selfimprovement,d4f0ijo,5,t5_2qmbm

8076563,0,t3_4ptdvn,Ive read psychocybernetics a few times and read about two thirds of awaken the giant within.Personally I much preferred psychocybernetics. If youve ever read a self help book before you will realise how much of it comes from this book but to me it just seems broken down and explained very well. I would say its my favourite self help book. I found awaken the giant within good in places but it didnt hold my interest like psychocybernetics did. There is some useful information in there though.Personally Id recommend reading both and start with psychocybernetics. If you are like me you will read it back to back a few times. There is good information in both and you may not agree with all of both books so you can cherry pick the bits you think will help you best.Hope this helps.,selfimprovement,d4nvqju,1,t5_2qmbm

8081972,0,t1_d4oeiyy,It turns out that multitasking actually improves performance in certain situations. For example in my psychology class we did this experiment where we had to balance a wooden dowel on the tip of your finger. There was a control group they were able to focus  on balancing the dowel because they didnt have to do any additional task a group that balanced the dowel while counting backwards by differing multiples ie   ... and a third group that balanced the dowel while reciting tongue twisters.  Both groups that were multitasking scored higher than the control group that was focusing on only balancing the dowel.But yeah generally multitasking is a terrible idea that almost never works out.,selfimprovement,d4ohl7w,3,t5_2qmbm

The emphasis is on who Im Being not on what I Have.Looking forward to death is the fate of us all. Nothing unique or insightful. As far as I can tell as much as you say you are looking forward to you death...you wont even get to have the experience OF death. The only experience you will ever have will be during your life. And then youll be dead. But you wont know it...cause youll be dead.Some people think there might be something after this life experience. Im fine with wishing or hoping for that but Im not counting on it. If there is something after this its just more experiences to go through. More of this...only different.In all the vastness of the universe I consider it remarkable that I am a sentient Being. Its actually a rare thing. Ive chosen to focus my energies on what I can Do with my Self starting from my Being. I end up Having a result from my efforts. Living life in this way bedohave allows for but does not guarantee fulfillment. Will this work for everyone? Probably not. Thats the beauty of being sentient. You get to say. You asked Whats the... point... In my experience the point is what makes it to be. In other words there is no thing as and this IS the point. With . billion people on the planet the point has to be flexible enough for each person to say what the point is...for them.You have implied that has to be a point to living. To which I reply... If you say so. There are so many people that never give it a thought. Many do but many dont. Do you need to Have a point to life? Then find it. Make it up. Create one.

8410928,0,t3_4uucl0,Hoping this doesnt come off as arrogant but coming from a naturally funny person its about being able to quickly make connections in your mind to play off whatever is being said. Its important to watch a lot of comedy and find which style makes you laugh the most because the things that you find funny yourself are the things that you will have the most success with. A lot of the time Ill be the first one laughing at what Im saying because Im saying it more to entertain myself than to make other people laugh.  Consuming a lot of comedy will also make you understand comedic timing and other more technical aspects but most importantly it will give you a deeper pool from which to draw from during a conversation.As the other comment in this thread mentions you shouldnt be afraid to say something because you dont think its funny enough. That only serves to make you more nervous. Even if you make a joke that falls flat which you will a lot especially when learning the indicator of success isnt whether the joke was received well but whether it was funny to you.

Ive tried different alarms alarms in the bathroom etc.What I found that was missing was my mindset. I thought of myself of a person who always had trouble getting up early. I also feared that I would miss out on something by getting up early. When I switched my mindset to actually believe that I was a person that got up early everything changed. I found it easy to get up at the set time from day  and have been going for  days straight. I think Ive had  day when I was a bit hesitant. Even on days when I get  hours of sleep I dont find it hard to get up.Mind you I continue to practise getting up during the day for building a strong habit of getting up I go over what pain I will recieve by sleeping in I found that by sleeping in  hours each day I lose  days per year!!! and pleasures I gain by getting up early.Its not the easiest thing to switch the mindset but I found that this has by far been the most effective one.

In others words not burdening you whatsoever but only pleasing you.    Should you figure out you dont actually love him it would be better to give someone else the chance to love him and help him.You love someone as a whole for what you see in them underneath all their flaws. Knowing what theyre really worth keeps you going when times get rough.    Be generous in prosperity and thankful in adversity.. Remember his true self what youre fighting for and be thankful for what you have.    Practice empathy and patience.Mind you all of the above applies viceversa as well. If your boyfriend is not also trying to better himself on his own the relationship is parasitic and he truly only seeks complacency. Should he get better the relationship will end because you serve him no purpose anymore.,selfimprovement,d9szv3b,-2,t5_2qmbm

10110639,0,t3_5kabhw,Honestly like youve said I dont believe there is a fix it all button but small incremental changes may certainly alleviate some of these thoughts. Ive always relied upon experience in getting over my fearsanxieties. For example if I was feeling inadequate over my intelligence Id work really hard and score well on a test. Thus Id have definite proof that I wasnt inadequate. And the more of these positive experiences can help reinforce against the darker thoughts. Now not everything can be objectively observed but the point of small positive victories helps drown out those negative voices. Write down something achievable against every negative thought you list and pursue it. Thanks for writing your thoughts because Ive had so many similar ones. Its always nice to know we arent alone. ,selfimprovement,dbpfd2y,1,t5_2qmbm

I suspect its because you think that will help you make connection and a good impression which implies to me that youre still in your head too much.  Maybe I havent been very clear.   By in your head I mean sort of overthinking in order to make a good impression come up with a witty or intelligent response or just drifting off.   I am NOT saying dont look them in the eyes.  In fact that is a good thing to do though not constantly.  People get uncomfortable if you do it too long at a stretch.  Now... I suspect youre thinking How do I know if its too long?  Again relax.  Dont overthink.  Go ahead and look them in the eyes a bit and look away a bit.  Stop thinking about the impression youre making and just try to be open to what they are saying.  Think about the words they are saying not to respond but to try to understand how they feel and what they are trying to convey to you.  And then you can ask clarifying questions if you need them but try to get part way to understanding on your own and youll get more practice with that.

10647187,0,t1_dddoq1z,gt Ive tried doing MO only but usually fall into using porn as well. Im interested in the fact that youve seemed to have reached a level of moderation successfully. How often do you MO whenever you feel like it or is there a schedule..? Just whenever I feel like it. If your day is filled with good activites it simply becomes totally unimportant for you. I also find that doing MO in moderation is a lot simpler than doing Nofap because when the porn cravings come you can just go rubbing your oneeyed snake and after youre done the craving to watch porn has gone completely away even though you didnt watch any. If you do Nofap on the other hand the craving never goes completely away even if you try to fill your day with good activities there will be a time when you are alone and dont have anything to do... In such moments you can still use discipline and willpower to overcome it but I find it to be not worth the effort and as I mentioned I also dont believe that it will bring any benefits. And this leads us to your other questionsgt And how long have you gone on full Nofap without having a wet dream?gt Why do you think this is false?I have never had a wet dream in my entire life. I did have sexual dreams though. I think the longest Nofaptime for me were four weeks. After that I didnt feel any benefits. In addition to that I knew that even the most alpha guys I know masturbate. And I had never found any convincing evidence for doing semen retention. I did read a lot of anecdotal evidence and stories about some witchdoctors or whatever but the more I researched the less I believed in Nofap. The only good argument for doing Nofap is just try it out you dont have anything to lose but I did that and didnt feel any improvements. I remember that I once read a thread years ago on askreddit not Nofap about Nofap and there almost everybody who had tried it out said it didnt work for them. I think you dont find those opinions on the Nofap subreddit because the negative people dont want to spoil it for those for whom it works. Whether it is only placebo for those people or it works for them because their body and mind is somehow different I cannot tell.But its completely different with avoiding porn there is both scientific evidence for the benefits or rather downsides that porn use brings and personal experience that convinced me that it worked.If you check out my account you will find a post on pornfree about my personal experiences. In this post I also talked about how there are articles on the web that say there is nothing wrong with porn but in the comment section it was pointed out to me that the author of the article had actually misinterpreted the study he used and that the study he had used was actually against porn as well.,selfimprovement,dde6br6,1,t5_2qmbm

11108402,0,t3_5yglwr,TLDR  Audiobooks People and MindMappingIt took me  yrs to learn English I was born in the U.S. I had very little social interactions failed a grade and was held back.  yrs later I had a Masters Degree in Computational Artificial Intelligence for Multiphysics Simulations.The first thing I had to build was confidence. I had a very awkward strong Chinese and deep southern accent. This was because my parents were immigrants and I stayed at neighbors houses for babysitting. That alone had a major effect of how I viewed myself. Since my English was terrible and my reading was even worse I was put in remedial classes. I thought I was very dumb. Turns out Im autistic but I have good spacial abilities. So I started to leverage that. People who are dyslexic tend to have good memories. Find a strength and leverage it. To get inspired listen to stories of triumph.Next learning. The first three books you should get are a memory book a speed reading book and a psychology book. Study them. It may take a full two years to get through them but youll learn how to increase your memory reading speed and learning techniques. There is too much to try and include here.Big one Audiobooks.I now listen to audio books all the time. I may need to listen to them  or  times but I get more information into my head by having it flow  hours a day.Next People. Just talk to people and ask questions. You will have to have confidence by this point and you may feel stupid but people are your best chance of learning effectively. I went to every office hour in college one semester and went from the bottom  to the top  just by talking to the TAs and asking for help learning the material.The best skill I have ever learned Mind Mapping.This is what memory experts all over the world do this is what the best Artificial Intelligence does this is what Sherlock Derren Brown and Richard Bandler do. Create a mental link between what you suck at and what youre good at. Take something like a deck of cards and assign each card a person then put each person in a numbered room then go through each room and create a story about them. This is the basic idea and its how card memory experts around the world memorize  decks of cards in order. Simple things like mnemonics are wonderful. Think Roy G. Biv for colors. Little tricks and tools like these can greatly improve you retention for knowledge and mental computational speed.Extra CuriosityJust be curious and when you want to know something look it up. You may never be as smart as Einstein but you can easily understand the concepts behind his ideas.

So when jealousy comes up you recognize it then try to do the opposite which is joy for somebody elses happiness. If you think about it jealousy itself is the real emotion taking something away from you since you cant be content. Other people will get things going their way all the time outside of your control.

11808913,0,t1_dgyauvg,I did not intend this to be a detailed discussion regarding Buddhism. I was criticizing the common notion that peace and love should simply be inserted into everything we do and this notion is pushed in almost every self help book that incorporates Buddhism principles. Look at the first  minutes at least also watch  for sureRobert Thurman How to Save the World  minutes and  seconds long video on youtube posting links is forbidden here apparently This guy is a Buddhist professor and an expert on Buddhism. The Dalai Lama says similar things practice nonviolence even while people are coming to kill you. It is clear that his message is isolate yourself from reality and just be happy. This is simply not practical. I agree with one part of his approach to be happy and not let your emotions such as anger translate into unnecessary conflict but my dualapproach is more balanced and practical because it also accounts for how to deal with realitythe current situation. We should not completely suppress our negative emotions we should channel them in a productive manner.  Also you dont need to be an expert on Buddhism to know that it is not compatible with our modern socialpoliticaleconomic system. Capitalism and nationalism are almost the polar opposite of Buddhism. Whereas Buddhism stresses peace love unity respect for the environment and detachment from the material world capitalism and nationalism the  dominant ideologies that run the world today are based on creating division fear hate destroying nature and creating unnecessaryunlimited greed which requires people to constantly be unhappy and look towards material gains for happiness so that sales do not stop. Therefore it is not practical to tell somebody who is struggling with money issues to sit at home and just love and be peaceful because that person will get thrown out while meditating for not paying the rent.I mean the ultimate goal of Buddhism is Nirvana. But under our nationalist capitalist world we are brainwashed to be consumers and soldiers till death. So if everybody practiced Buddhism modern society would cease to exist. Therefore it is impractical to claim that Buddhism is compatible with modern society. That is why I think it makes no sense to tell people living under modern society to act according to Buddhist ideals without also taking action to change modern society and its structural inefficiencies.Self help books completely overlook these facts. They completely ignore the constraints that are put on us by our socialpoliticaleconomic system. Self help books say do these things to become successfulrichhappy. Well under our system being rich is relative not everybody can be rich. Not everybody can be successful. And since it is very difficult to be happy when you dont have enough money which is required to meet your basic needs not everybody can be happy under this system. Self help books completely overlook these facts and sell a delusion. My dualapproach also takes into account the practical side of the equation. ,selfimprovement,dgykxqe,0,t5_2qmbm
