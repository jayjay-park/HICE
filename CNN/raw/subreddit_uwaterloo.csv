13446,0,t3_1u9t77,For the engineering st year courses they are held in Winter and Fall unsure about spring.They are held during the final exam period and I would make sure you have a day or so off to study.  I had to do  exam and I stayed at a bed and breakfast the day before so I could focus on my studies and attend a tutorial for the course this doesnt always happen. Failing the supplementary exams means you have to take the course again and if its off term it will cost you at least .My employers never made a big deal about the course most of them had a failed course or two in the past.  If you have past UW engineers in the office theyll understand.  ,uwaterloo,cefyr5g,2,t5_2rb5s

274250,0,t3_1x8ii2,I was in the exact situation last year. Cultural vista says they dont do dual visas but I found another company that did this was a year ago so maybe they do dual visas now?. Theyre called INTRAX and its very simple they put both companies on the same visa. Even though my first company had their own visa sponsor they were willing to work with my second company to get me the dual visa. You will need to have both companies planned out by the time you apply for the visa though so you cant go there and look for your second job later. Not with this method at least. One of my friends instead extended his  month visa WHILE HE WAS THERE to  months so thats an option.I also have a friend who was working at a bay company while she found another job for the next term. She had to fly back but it was paid for by the company and wait  weeks for her status to reset. Its a gamble though because the time it takes for it to reset varies.When I asked the school about this it was a flat out no. But research around and you realize tons of people have done it successfully.,uwaterloo,cf96sby,3,t5_2rb5s

Dont mention all the things that were wrong with it or say that things were really simple summarize each project with some key concepts you learned from it on your resume. Figure out a good way to describe it in more detail in an interview. Talk about how you worked independentlyon a team how you built it from scratch in X amount of time and learnedused whatever concepts. The way you describe it to me here isnt very useful dont say I created and used objects but talk a bit about how you set up and instantiated your classes.There are maybe  types of OOP questions in interviews that Ive run into. First is really highleveloverviewgeneral concept ones  sometimes people ask me straight out what is encapsulation? or what is inheritance? or what is polymorphism? and then want me to provide a simple example of it in use. The next kind are questions that are a bit more specific but suggest that the person has experience using classes  stuff that comes to mind is like what is the difference between the keywords public protected and private? and how do these relate to inheritance? or what is the difference between a struct and a class in C? or what is an abstract function? or what is a virtual function? The book I mentioned earlier should have more its available online I would link but Im on my phone. The last kind of question is practical. They hand you some code and want you to describeanalyze it or expand it. Alternatively you might just have to write it from scratch. I also actually had an interview once where they wanted me to draw a class inheritance diagram it was pretty strange and unique. ,uwaterloo,cktzbk0,2,t5_2rb5s

2117981,0,t3_2j6nxi,Either way you are in for a lot of work. If you care about your topic then youll make it just fine.  If you choose your program based on what you think is the correct choice you might struggle. Planning and engineering are fundamentally different. A planner develops policy and goals. They are concerned with social impacts and how to build communities among other things. I took the two introductory planning courses as electives. We discussed how development styles and decisions had impacted neighbourhoods and communities. Civil engineering is a broad program. The main specializations in it are Structural buildings and bridges Transportation traffic roads rail and airports Water Resources water treatment river modelling and water supply Geotechnical soils foundations dams and retaliating walls and Civil Site grading utilities and drainage. Engineering is focused on analysis and design. You solve the specific problem given to you. We use math and physics as our primary tools.  Depending on your job you get to exercise creativity in applying those tools to solve your problem. Often your solution is quantifiably right or wrong. You can get jobs in consulting government construction academia large corporations eg oil companies and product design.I hope that helps some. You should find a planner to give you advice about planning. Cougar the program that will get you to the cater you want. ,uwaterloo,cl91hwz,4,t5_2rb5s

Most of the profslecturers are pretty good about making concessions here and there especially if many people have scheduling conflicts. The teachers are supportive and most have practical work experience if not just from consulting while working as profs but also within the industry. Youll also get a wide range of practicing professionals coming in for guest lectures.Planning is less technical overall but depending on what you choose to specialise in you can still need to have some hella smarts. You need to know a variety of different things  legislation community engagement strategy and have a lot of common sense  but be able to describe it to someone who is going to have no idea what youre talking about.Either bachelors degree can lead to the other at advanced degree level. I had classmates that went on to get masters of civil engineering focussing on topics such as transit or transportation planning. Youll find both field full of crossqualified teams and individuals.My coop experiences werent the greatest in terms of where I wanted to be. I wanted in my first couple terms to get to work on planning applications at a municipal level and that never happened. The first planning application I got to assess was nearly  years after graduation! Im hoping theyve worked through the process to ensure that students are getting adequate coop placements now that planning is mandatory coop we had about  coop spots in my year.Hope this helps!,uwaterloo,cltr62g,1,t5_2rb5s

Theyll usually set up a projector for major sporting events like the World Cup or Olympics. I worked on the hardware side smaller group  side of building so I was in the hardware lab a lot and got to play with some really cool stuff. Im not sure about your team but the people I worked with were very laid back friendly and smart. They usually went out for lunch weekly. The managementteam leads are all very knowledgeable and technical which was awesome because Ive worked in places where the people in charge didnt understand anything that was going on. The office is a bit hard to get to without a car Im not sure how much the bus routes have changed but there used to be a bus route that ran right beside the office and one that ran a few streets over which wasnt hard to get to by cutting through parking lots and such. Theres a plaza a few streets over which has several restaurantfood options.

There are some fairly standard mathematics which you will just learn in courses and there is some esoteric stuff out there which may only be covered in one course or not at all. For example I am interested in Fractals so I do some reading on my own time into that subject. I also tried to learn about Category theory but it proved to be too time consuming to do that as well while taking Math .The UW Library is priceless go to the librarys main page type in some key word like topology with the word introduction and take a look at the books to see if theyre at your level then start reading.I also HIGHLY recommend you look at books published by Springer.

Its all built up on easy fundamentals.What makes it difficult are bad profs and the huge amount of terrible TAs in the ECE department. I am absolutely refreshed going into th year it seems like I am going to finally have a term where I wont be subject to one bad prof that sucks the life out of a course. The  and  class had a town hall with Manoj head of ECE last term since  of the class had failed out of our class before th year. The professors were complaining we werent showing up to class. Why would we go to class when there are class notes that are posted as well as professor voice notes for each slide which is way better than this trashcan interim prof you have teaching a course? Why should we care about the  level courses when they are for kids with absolutely no group skills which is fine but you make us do arbitrary shit unrelated to ECE in the course. FFFFFFFUUUUUUUUFFUAUFUAUFUASUAUSFU THE ECE DEPARTMENT IS GOD DAMN INFURIATING. Dont give your money to this school my god. You are going to have  years of early classes lots of labs and no flexibility in schedule. Im having school withdrawal issues in th year because all of a sudden all of my courses fit within  days so I have nothing to do on Mondays or Fridays.On the other hand  if my children want to do ECE or any engineering for that matter when they graduate highschool they will be going to Waterloo.

4013137,0,t1_crdmjo7,If I recall correctly its not possible to take  courses in A. In every subsequent term if your cumulative average is above  then you can take  courses. If youre realllyy good then if you mantain  with  courses you can take . I think. Dont quote that nd part.As for CSYou can email the prof and maybe hell let you in but last year the course started over capacity and very fewno one got in outside of through the contests. CS can be transferred into from CS if you do well. However theres going to be a fairly significant amount of material to catch up on.

4030207,0,t3_36ob7o,I got started in cs by taking my high schools grade  and  cs courses. And I absolutely hated them. Our teacher didnt know a lick of java himself and to boot there were only  other kids in the class. All three of them were extremely good and I just felt like shit not being able to understand what an object was or what static meant. I hated it so much that I decided I would never code again well at least not academically. And then came grade  I took both  and  cs in grade  and I wanted to study business  I was pretty good at math so I decided to go for ... you guessed it ... Western ivey with Math. And at the last possible moment I decided to apply to uwaterloos Mathematical Finance I was clueless as to how difficult MF was. Long story short got rejected from all of the places I wanted to go to and Waterloo was the only good offer I had so I took it.But how does it relate to cs you ask? Well Im getting there. About halfway into my summer I found out what I would have to do take a cs course gg for me. I didnt know I could take cs or even what that was so I ended up in cs. First term was pretty rough for me. All the academic expectations were pretty much shattered. Calculus and algebra were hard not even in s but cs was easy. Id never heard about graphs or dictionaries. But what did you say no objects? I like the sound of that. But most of all doing cs assignments was like crack cocaine. When I got the solution I was Donald Knuth incarnate. These two things really threw me off my plan and got me rethinking a lot of shit.Second term was very different. I got my work ethic in order and did well in every course. I also had done time to think about my experiences.So even though I am undeclared atm its most likely going to be CS.TLDR I got into cs because cs had me trippin,uwaterloo,crfoae8,4,t5_2rb5s

I had the tendency to fall behind in my courses during the term and the further behind I fell the worse the anxiety got and the more useless I felt. It was a vicious cycle. I failed my A term by . and petitioned the result and even though they didnt let me pass the term they gave me some concessions. I had some history of going through anxiety in th grade also and had been prescribed some antianxiety medications but I ended up never using them because I didnt want to use that as a crutch throughout my life. When I failed the term I went back to my psychiatrist and explained what was going on to him got another prescription and used that in my petition. My advice to you is that if you want to cite mental health reasons you should go to a medical professional and get their opinion. This will help you provide documentation for your petition and hey will probably help you get on the right path as well!If you want someone to talk to or need any advice feel free to PM me. ,uwaterloo,crqnmy6,5,t5_2rb5s

4428822,0,t3_3bqc0q, Most old buildings contain asbestos unless it has been removed already. It used to be a very common building material. Asbestos is only a problem when its disturbed it creates asbestos dust particles that become suspended in the air. There is no point in removing it unless it will be disturbed eg. construction renovations etc There are laws regarding asbestos to protect your health if asbestos removal wasnt safe enough for this solution to be acceptable the entire building would be closed down for your safety. If there was some kind of error that caused asbestos particles to travel throughout the building the building would probably be evacuated. Even in the worst case its not too much to worry about Asbestos isnt much of a problem unless youve had long term exposure to it think occupational levels of exposure. You will not die or fall ill from inhaling a few particles. Exposure should however be minimized because it is a carcinogen. Asbestos is a naturally occurring material. It naturally occurs in our air and drinking water. Most people have tens of thousands of asbestos particles in their lungs already. Its a fact of life. Thats not to say however that you would be safe to regularly increase your exposure to it.,uwaterloo,csoxysk,21,t5_2rb5s

5668421,0,t1_cwxdjp9,I dont consider assignments studying when I forget the majority of the content once Im finished the assignment. I dont find I retain the information from doing certain topics in big chunks and then moving on to the next topic. And no worries about being blunt Im aware in the beginning that its one of the biggest reasons why Im so overwhelmed by it.  I have been challenged in the way Im challenged now but with grade  english and physics had very little time in the way I do now for a few months from projects not math.  My biggest problem though is that I dont know if I even want to keep going with it.  Like I just cant tell if math is something I want to keep in my life as a hobby or interest or if I should keep going with it.  Its just really frustrating because I thought I knew what I wanted for so long but now when I think about spending the rest of my life in a math career I get really upset.,uwaterloo,cwzq1ko,1,t5_2rb5s

Instead realize that its just something you want to change like a bad diet or some other equatable habit. Make small changes and efforts and work towards larger ones. Realistically it will be difficult because of the biochemical and psychological association with it. Exercise is a good suggestion  you can kill two birds with one stone with this stop watching porn and get in shape. Additionally the process of exercising will release hormones that may satiate or lesson your desires or impulses. The trick here is consistency and determination.

Theres one midterm and a final and we get a  bonus assignment like every week which is basically find a news article where the journalist makes one of the errors in reasoning we talked about this week. Ive never taken another PHIL course but this is one of the easiest courses Ive taken overall and its pretty interesting as it gives you a framework to think about information with. The prof teaches exactly whats in the textbook but hes entertaining to listen to and deals with students really well. Hes open to criticism and healthy debate which I imagine all PHIL profs should be and instead of slides he writes on the chalkboard which I totally love for some reason.Would recommend but dont go into it thinking critical thinking is when you tell the prof hes wrong about everything he says.

The course assignments and such are programming based and there are weekly computer labs where you code and explore models you learn about in class. Midterms and finals have programming questions on them requiring you to write code with pen and paper to accomplish a given task. Overall much more focused on the math and programming side although as it only assumes a first semester calc level you shouldnt worry about anything being too advanced and even then the general concepts and how to apply them are more important as the computer will do all the number and letter crunching for you. Probably  or  MathProgrammingBiology. Personally I liked this course a lot more than . was R but was a lot less heavy on the programming and math side again as you might surmise from the Ecology and stats prereqs. Assignments were primary Ecology based with some programming on the side from what I remember. The models were mostly the same as  but werent covered in as much detail although there were a few that were unique to .

6197149,0,t3_40fkwl,Youre just worrying too much. Trust the responses here youll be fine.Ive since graduated from chem eng and our class took about  years and a bit to actually settle into real friendships.In first year people really only hang out with residence friends. Second year is people still holding onto as many of those friends as possible. The good bonds will stick dont worry the rest will fall away. Itll be good to see them all again but you probably wont hang out all the time.Around late second year is probably when your class will really start getting along well and hangout out together. Sometimes it takes someone to throw a nice big class party just so everyone has a chance to see their classmates in a nonacademic setting.If you want to make friends with your classmates suggest going to the bar after a lab exam or class. Go to kickoffs bomber molly blooms etc. and just have a few beers. Thats probably the best way in my opinion to get to know classmates.You dont have to plan outings to uptown. If you dont like clubbing neither did I go somewhere else. Many of my uptown nights were unplanned and started at kickoffs. Wed go there have a beer and talk until we all accepted that we collectively didnt have any other plans tonight and theres plenty of time to finish the lab tomorrow so fuck it lets go to huether and play pool or Duke for some of the best live music in Waterloo.Go on the pub crawls feel free to skip Phils or the other clubs.Now this last part take with a grain of salt. I dont know you at all so I cant guarantee its applicable and it probably sound rude.Having a boyfriend is going to get in the way of making your own friends. Dont get mad at me for saying that because its probably true. Im not saying dump him Im just reminding you that its a sacrifice of being in a relationship.For one most guys are going to back down when they know you have a boyfriend. Theyre keeping themselves in check. They dont want to start hanging out with you and pissing off some random boyfriend or worse developing feelings for you.Second youre simply going to spend time with your boyfriend and thats time that doesnt get spent with your own friends. Youre putting another factor on the scale and its going to be harder to balance. Ive had some classmates get into a relationship and just disappear some who stay social and some who now bring their boyfriend along everywhere with us. I cant make assumptions on your relationship dynamic so thats up to you to work out.Honestly though just ask a group of classmates to go to the bar after class. Youll get a few yess and have a good time. Just dont try to order domestic at kickoffs. Theres a chalkboard with the tap list. Read that and ask Bill or Troy for ideas on what you might like. ,uwaterloo,cyu1sre,1,t5_2rb5s

Move the education to the bottom just above interests. Literally every applicant is the same as you. It is not a distinguishing feature nor the most important point. as a more general point I get no information from your experience how you actually know any of your skills. Where did you use machine learning saying you learned it means nothing? How did it help you with your tasks? What was the benefit of using it? Where did you learn PMP or apply it? You cant just list points. They have to mesh together to tell the story of who you are and then the interview has to back that up.  Skills I see in your experience bullet points but are not listed in your top section Excel macrosvbscript sharepoint data extraction financial analyst being a team leader full stack development presumably you needed a database and stuff for MovLens... code integration libraries teammate algorithms and data models general coding Skills I see that are awkward An understanding of PMP. You never use it. Machine learning its not clear that you use it I know you do based on the first point of MovLens but a reader will not since you did not explicitly state that you used machine learning for the recommendations.

6436173,0,t3_43u7ho,WPIRG stands for Waterloo Public Interest Research Group.  Generally speaking they do things that benefit the public community meals ralliesprotests against tuition hikes LGBT rights housing rights etc.  They also offer support in the way of funding for people organizing events that target minorities nonwhite women or LGBT.Most of the recent hate is due to the VoteYes campaign since WPIRG was sponsoring them.  A lot of people who didnt know what WPIRG was or does found out about it when the referendum popped up.  People who had signed not knowing what it was really about and others who felt like this was a political issue that shouldnt be a part of academia were annoyed the vocal minority spoke out about a lot on Reddit it didnt help that a lot of the VoteYes on Reddit were straight out of pol and a group organized the VoteNo campaign.Now that the referendum is over people are still angry for various reasons They feel that their interests were not represented by the group at all.   People who had just found out about WPIRG looked at the finances and realized a large chunk more than the amount going to their efforts was going towards salaries. WPIRG has a lot of social justice warriors and they feel like a group like that shouldnt be getting money to run around with. In sponsoring and supporting the VoteYes WPIRG has shown that they have political agendasbiases and they believe student money shouldnt be going towards political issues. They dont like some of the more vocal members of WPIRG for various reasons.For all the above reasons they feel that the fee should be optin so that true supporters would pay the fee.  Its worth mentioning but doesnt stand as a reason why that the optin people believe WPIRG duplicates a lot of the services FEDs already provides though that isnt a reason to particularly dislike them.    Addendum Its worth noting that among its active members WPIRG does represent them well and does actually do things with the intent of helping those who they feel are minorities.  In general anyone who is a member can come and vote on the issues and where money is being allocated and if they dont want to be a part of the organization they can come and get a refund.  The issue the vocal individuals on Reddit take with this is that most people wont want to put in the effort to get back the  but if they didnt have to give it in the first place would never give it.  Thus an individual who doesnt agree with their decisions has less power in meetings because the majority are a group of likeminded individuals who tend to feel the same about social issues regardless of if the issue is blackandwhite.,uwaterloo,czl1e74,20,t5_2rb5s

I think what youre going through every university student goes through regardless of their program. Honestly. The economy is shit. Total shit and it honestly doesnt matter what undergraduate degree you get. Every degree can be a gamble even something that you were told in high school would guarantee you employment. Theres no guarantee youll find fulltime permanent employment right away.And I get all this can be overwhelming because youre investing time and money into all of this. But despite knowing that uncertainty you just have to push through. I think like many others said you have to be willing to work hard and push yourself through the tough times. Eventually life ends up working out for itself. Most of my friends that recently graduated all struggled to find fulltime employment. Some are working contract positions others are working parttime and preparing for graduate school. Some people are still looking for jobs and some are already employed. For example my older sister was in life science and she hated it. She eventually wanted to become a doctor but made the brave switch into English. She eventually ended up getting her PhD because she worked tirelessly and has a great career now. Everybody has a different path but if you work hard and believe in yourself youll eventually get there.,uwaterloo,d0xy6co,1,t5_2rb5s

The math courses in cs are more critical thinking. The assignments start off with some easy applied questions. The later questions ask you to prove that general patterns exist. The closest thing I did in ib with math here was induction.If you really dont enjoy math or you had to completely busy your ass to get that  the consider if youre entering the right field. However if youre a good problem solver and think you can handle a much much bigger dosage of math then you should be fine.

Is that a valid reason?it certainly doesnt hurt but its also not terribly relevant. honestly i think they will tell you that part of being a student assumedly in coop is balancing school and work responsibilities and it also wouldnt explain your A marks. the circumstances i was alluding to are more in the serious illnessinjury camp with appropriate documentation.at any rate best of luck. they may curve MATH  if the average is lower than they want so just hang tight until marks are out ,uwaterloo,d1vnxer,1,t5_2rb5s

Its almost insulting to compare these two scenarios and treat them alike. In the first instance little happens. They dont penalize you for a poor performance on the Euclid. You go to sleep and thats all. In the second instance you potentially waste  months on a course your average gets lowered dramatically and you might even get held back a term. You end up wasting from  to  shoutout to AFM tuition because you failed the course and then you get threatened with probation or even getting kicked out of your faculty. If youre in third or fourth year you just lost your chance of getting into graduate school. If youre worried about some contest Id hate to see what happens when those same questions on the Euclid end up on your first math midterm worth  of your final mark. Tbh maybe its just the stress of exam season and Im just being hard on you but seeing people being anxious about trivial stuff like this just riles me up.

7380742,0,t3_4gejnf,I would recommend SimpleTax  its really great software and its paywhatyouwant. Im not sure if its possible to file through them the first time around they didnt used to allow it but that may have changed.SimpleTax can give you suggestions on things that may apply to various situations including students. But from my experience here are some things that youll want to gather TA and charitable donations slips from Quest. Tax receipts for the bus pass thats included in your student fees. You can claim the bus pass fees for all of your fulltime study terms not coop terms. You can get the receipts for that here  But if you had no income last year then claiming the bus pass wont do any good  it cannot be carried forward. If you worked in Canada last year your employer will have issued you a T slip that youll need to include. Rent receipts. You can report the rent you paid in Ontario and you may qualify for some additional money Ontario Energy and Property Tax Credit However if you made too much money last year then you wont get anything back from this. You are supposed to report all interest your bank paid you. They may or may not issue you a T slip for it depending on the amount. Regardless you are supposed to report it. If you made any investments you may have T or T slips to report or capital gains to calculate. If you dont do investing then theres no need to worry about this. If you worked outside of Canada things are more complicated.For my first time around I used TurboTax. IMO its not as nice as SimpleTax but the first time around you may benefit from TurboTaxs interview style. Also since youre a student and a first year you may not have to pay anything to use TurboTax they have some free plans for certain types of situations.Disclaimer Im not an accountant and this is not exhaustive.,uwaterloo,d2h51os,1,t5_2rb5s

Why did you receive a good?They let me start my answer and then added Other candidates have very goods and excellents.I was pretty much forced into making up an excuse or to tell the truth and sound like I was making an excuse. I stuck to my guns there and I gave a less professional version of the followingThe the company simply did not have as much work as they expected for a coop student as they were a startup company. Most of the available work there was either easy enough that it should only require a parttime employee or it required a level of expertise that only a professional engineer or a consultant could offer. Daytoday work was insufficient for my fulltime position and a coop student is not suitable for the more professional work that was required.I served mostly as an idea generator and an advocate. The senior engineer and scientist would propose ideas and being a set of fresh eyes I would see if I could find flaws or ways to improve those ideas. Occasionally Id have the wiggle room to come up with process solutions of my own.The company would have been better off hiring a consultant or a part time professional rather than a coop student.

Basically if you got four s and a  you are much worse off in the GPA scale than you are in the percent scale as with the percent scale your marks will balance off but with the GPA scale the lower mark essentially is given more weight due to the variance.

Some women are happier that way and it seems like you dont have the attitude of a woman who wants to be in the workforce.

7709247,0,t3_4kvfau,The program is planned to compliment Velocity but there are  main differences . The ENGS program has a program component specifically for Team and Idea selection to help before the Velocity program. While you are accepted into Velocity with a selected Team  Idea if not a working prototype. The hypothesis is that if you improve the quality of the inputs the outputs should improve as well.. The ENGS has faculty on its IC while Velocity judges and runs separate from faculty. The goal of increasing faculty exposure is twofold. First is to bring the technical expertise faculty has to teams. Second is to help faculty get more in tune with evaluating startup teamsideas so that they can learn for the core curriculum.. Funding amounts are x larger than Velocity per team. Checks sizes are on the order of kk. So putting that into Velocity itself may change that program. Instead ENGS funding can help teams after initial Velocity funding or even teams that didnt go through Velocity and are ready for regular seed funding.,uwaterloo,d3ihn8b,6,t5_2rb5s

8436812,0,t3_4uojou,I cant answer . and . because I havent done any undergraduate courses here Ive just come here to do graduate studies but I did a full year of Organic Chem two years ago in my nd year and it was pretty bad. The first term was okay but the nd term there were only about  of us in the class and it was awful. I dont know how it works here but where I took it there were no lectures you just did the assignments in class and outside of class a lot of group work and wrote midtermsquizzes and he answered specific questions about the assignments etc. in class and did practice problems. You were expected to do the readings before you came so if you didnt read the chapter you might as well have stared at the wall the whole time.Theres no bones about it Organic Chem is hard. Ive never met someone who said it was easy. I like to believe Im relatively good at chemistry considering Im studying Biochemistry now but you really need to know your shit. If you dont know basic first year chemistry and are not able to get some kind of a grasp on interactions and how mechanisms work youre boned. I attribute some of my difficulties with Organic Chem due to the prof being shitty and not structuring the class properly.Heres how you survive Organic Chem you do whatever assignments and practice problems that the prof decides to give you and then some more. There should be a bunch of practice problems in the book and I would suggest studying enough to understand the basics behind each chapter and then attempting every problem for that chapter. If you do well on the problems youre good to go. You need to work hard if you want to do well which should be standard for any class but moreso in this subject area. The only way youll do good in Organic Chem is if you practice because its an area of study where reading a textbook and trying to absorb information just wont cut it. You need to understand reactions and interactions so when the prof throws you something new you can work it out based on what you know about the reactionThis could all be useless information depending on how the Organic Chemistry class here works but I really think practicing problems on your own time is your best bet to do well. Also ask a shit ton of questions if you dont understand and dont think twice about it. Cant help you decide what class to do specifically though,uwaterloo,d5w534v,1,t5_2rb5s

8448233,0,t1_d5xji21,gtAccording to who?A quick google searchgtMATLAB is really old it used to be a good educational tool.I actually sucked at programming so I found MATLAB to be perfectly fine.

I just dont find enough reasons for them to substitute MATLAB out and redesign the course completely based on another programming language.gtWhy would they come from different backgrounds? All math students take MATH.Youll be surprised how many PMATH students actually came from MATH . The applied content really depends on the instructor and sometimes it does happen and suck that your instructor comes from PMATH department but we do learn different things in  and .To be very honest if you only hold an AMATH major I would assume that you want to go to grad school. Otherwise people usually do a double major with COCS or so. I think all the th year courses involve DEs whether its more theoretical PDE calculus of variations etc or applied Fluid control etc. I think that is how our department defines it but surely other universities or companies can have different interpretations of what applied math should be.,uwaterloo,d5xke4k,1,t5_2rb5s

8523383,0,t3_4wh22k,Not to be disrespectful to your parents or anything but do either of them work in either CS or accounting?  If the answer is no its probably better that you talk to an adult who actually does the profession you are interested in to see what its like.  I find that a lot of my parents including mine make decisionsgive advice based on what they perceive about a career e.g. how prestigious it is how much money they think you can make.  If they are uneducated chances are they will be wrong.  I cant speak for AFM but most of my colleagues are in the  year range after graduation have switched jobs a few times some voluntarily others not but I certainly would not say there is no future.  Alternatively you can try to do both maybe stick with AFM for the first year try to take a few CS courses to see whether or not you actually want to do CS.

8591064,0,t1_d6fa28m,gtfourth year undergrad courses and grad courses are pretty much equal    This isnt correct. Its true that some grad courses are crosslisted with fourth year undergrad courses but grad students are expected to do more work than undergrads in those courses e.g. submitting a course project between the last lecture and the exam. Higherlevel grad courses are purely researchbased. Not to mention that courses often take a backseat to teaching and your thesis.

Since you really want a change I presume youre more selfdisciplined and in control and hence matured dont aim for a  aim for a  because you can and its possible. Thinking positively and having selfconfidence is the first step towards it. Dont question yourself or think that because such and such happened before then this is not possible for me. For studying habits I study everyday and I relate everything I learned to real life things  everything you learn has a meaning and usefulness to it even if its some sick dance move you learned on youtube. The reason we find it useless is because we dont see a connectionlink to it and our brain cannot pick it up  we automatically find it boring.Have a mindset that you want to conquer and your brain can take any amount of knowledge you feed it  its limitless. The more you feed it the stronger and better it will get so next time you want to memorize  random cell phone number itll be a cake. Id suggest doing some things now even before the school starts  familarize yourself with the courses and syllabus update your resume and research on it search on reddit and other places have it critiqued earlier. Apply to jobs online starting st of Sept. and apply to jobs on jobmine when it opens up. You should know by now what type of industry and type of work youre very interested in  dont go by what others are going or what all your friends are doing but obviously an employer will definitely want you to have some experience in that field since youre in B and best way to earn that is through the student teams and research. One last thing dont give a damn about what others are doing saying etc. because this will send your brain into stress mode thinking all the whys someone with a . ended up at Apple?

8687383,0,t3_4yt7i5,yes you can significantly improve your average and it seems that every term gets a little bit easier in terms of workload so you should find things are more manageable as time goes on. First year tends to be tough and people switch or drop out at that point. Perhaps thats a reason why things are the hardest then to get people out of the program that are unlikely to succeed.The question is deciding what value having high grades are for you. I generally get s and s for most of my courses but I am satisfied with those grades because for me grades are not of much value.

Do your best and do not get discouraged many of my friends failed this course during first year kin  if this happens it is not the end of the world you can re take it later.First and second year kin will likely be the most difficult years of the program with the general sciences and required physics and math courses.

10018451,0,t3_5j449r,As part of a couple of my various roles on campus I had the opportunity to discuss these changes at the May meeting of Senate Undergraduate Council and the June Senate meeting. In addition to this new guideline the text of Policy  student discipline is also set to receive an update. Some additional text will be added to course outlines also.The primary purpose of these changes is to set out some clear processes and tools with which the University can combat external orgs that make money by selling access to past terms course material exams assignments handouts slides without the permission of the people who created that material. Course outlines and exams are the property of the University while handoutsslidesetc are the intellectual property of the instructor who made them. The University currently sends ceaseanddesist notices to these companies but wants to expand their reach.Exam banks will not be affected by this change.I was personally fine with the updates though I expressed two reservations to senior admin The text of the Policy  update is too broad and nonspecific. Im worried someone might down the line go after a student who shares past courseware or slides or other materials with a friend taking the same course in a later term. I want more focused language this process is ongoing. This update wont really solve the root problem. Longterm we need to seriously revisit how we approach course materials as intellectual property.,uwaterloo,dbdfkvp,13,t5_2rb5s

11126937,0,t3_5yvgy6,ChEundergrad here third year. Ive gotten good experience so far in relevant sectors in Canada through a bit of work and a lot of the stars aligning. The economy is tougher than ever and its quite hard to stand out among so many other ChE students in Canada. My . on finding your way in this programIf youre in first year learn as much as you can about where chemical engineering can take you. Are you more interested in the research realm process engineering process controls process design business and long term planning etc.? Having an idea of what type of role will fit you best and what steps you need to take to get there is always an asset. Chemical engineers work in a variety of industries including water resources technology materials metals mining paper oil amp gas specialty chemicals manufacturing and more. All those lines of work I mentioned in the previous paragraph are present in different teams within various companies in these industries. Find one or a few of these areas you think will be of interest to you and work for it like youre trying to pass the school term. School will have to take a backseat to your jobsearch at many points in the term. Quite honestly you likely wont use  of what you learn in school as your industry experience is what truly shapes your competencies. Senior engineers will tell you this all the time.All in all if youre deadset on being a chemical engineer in whatever area you like go for it with a passion and youll have a great chance at finding the opportunities. Look through other sources outside jobmine your personal network. Learn the networking skills companies love and how to make your resumecover letter both easy to read and uniquely passionate. Stand out!If youre considering switching look into the kinds of work youll be doing in those other areas. How do they compare? Would you enjoy it? Is tech something you like? Look back on what made you choose chemical engineering to begin with and how the expectations compare with the realities youre learning about.,uwaterloo,det88ym,5,t5_2rb5s

My theory is that everybody logged into the same Eduroam Burger King Lesterresidence wifi over time and the reddit admins didnt use any critical thinking in analyzing this because they thought our mods wouldnt give a damn when we spoke out like some bigger subreddits.  They probably thought oh no vote manipulation report we better just lay down the bans to appease the mod team!They clearly didnt consider the fact that ruwaterloo would have the majority of its users in Waterloo with overlapping IP address history and they obviously didnt even bother to use their brains and think about why the comments would all be calling out Mijem for massdownvoting the post and yet ban ordinary users with no suspicious behaviour for upvoting the post.  Absolutely stupid.This goes to show the kind of difference between Alexis build stuff that doesnt scale Ohanian and companies that actually do things properly from the getgo.

11291754,0,t3_613prh,ERS coop student here! The required courses arent too hard mostly essay based assignmentsexams for the ers courses. If you have trouble with writing there are a lot of resources to help you improve. In B theres an intro to stats course that most environment students are required to take if you took data management it will be easy  I took functions so it was very new to me haha. In second year theres some stats in one of the required courses. Its one of those programs that as long as you go to class do the readings and study youll do well. There can be a lot of readings but its not horrible  you wont fail if you miss some. Its definitely not as hard as the science route Im doing a bio minor and science courses are usually my lower marks it takes me a lot longer to memorize info!. You should be able to do a minor in economics my friend in EB is doing one and Im pretty sure they have more required courses. You can take online courses during coop too.  As for coop there are a lot of different routes off the top of my head the government federal provincial municipal consulting ngos conservation authorities and education uw research outdoor ed. Each of those can have varying jobs biologyecologywildlife  whether lab field or office waterwastewater waste management gis pollution restoration agriculture. Of course you can apply to jobs outside of the programfaculty if youre qualified. It would definitely be helpful to have any sort of related or transferable workvolunteer experience before your first coop I did door to door for an environmental group the summer of first year. You have your first summer off then afaik if its still the same you apply for jobs in the fall for winter term. Dont expect to rely on the university for all your applications though the number of jobs seem to change each term. If you decide coop isnt for you you can easily drop it. It shouldnt be too hard to get a job out of undergrad I hope I graduate next year... if you get good work experience and connectionsnetworking you get from coopprofspeers. There are a lot of specializations you can get into options diplomas certifications that can help and arent too hard to fit in. Definitely use coop to your advantage to see what you do and dont like doing any experience is useful honestly. You can then decide to do a masters or additional college programs  if you feel you need it. If youre thinking of doing a masters youll need at least  academic references. TLDR A not a demanding course you can most likely minor in economics B various coop jobs but look outside uw too C you can likely get a job out of undergrad but depending on what you want to do you may need extra schooling to advance masterscollege. Prepare as if you want to get into a masters program if you think its a possibility. ,uwaterloo,dfbwk1v,3,t5_2rb5s

11499196,0,t1_dfzdxen,Yes I dont mean for coursework friend told me they do Racket which is apparently not a real language just for learning but I meant for side projects to use to apply to my firstsecond coops where I dont have any previous experience.Also I dont use reddit often and Im not sure how to PM someone so Ill just ask these other questions Ive been thinking of here if thats ok.. Is there anything that U of T St. George CS has that Waterloo doesnt or is Waterloo CS unquestionably the better choice? I was thinking since UTSG is a bigger school and does more research it may be useful to get some research going in third or fourth year so I can go to grad school whereas at Waterloo Id probably be too busy either studying or applying to coops. Im still not sure whether I want to do a phd or just go into industry but it may be useful to leave that option open. Do you think its harder for a Waterloo grad to get into top grad school programs for CS like CMU Berkeley MIT etc since they spent a lot of time working rather than doing undergraduate research which is apparently what grad schools value more?. Do I have to be smart to succeed in CS? Is there such a thing as a dumb person who has a very strong work ethic who went on to work for Google or does CS require a special intuition problem solving skills and analytical skills that certain people just dont possess? Im not going to let this dissuade me from going into CS but I am a bit wary about jumping into something I have no experience with because I have no idea whether Id even like building software and writing code and whether I can wrap my brain around it. All I know is I like math and computers.. What percentage of your class third year from your info box next to your username has worked for a Big  company or a startup in the US?. How much free time do you have per day? After studying homework side projects applying to coops interviewing preparing for interviews writing cover letters etc. Im prepared to give up on a social life and finding a girlfriend but I would still like some time every day for my hobbies. . How do you like the program so far? What do you think is the biggest difference between Waterloo CS and for example Berkeley or Stanford or MIT CS? . After a certain point getting higher grades would just be diminishing returns. What do you think is a good average to settle for where if you put any more work into your grades it would be worse for your resume than if you put that time into side projectsinterview prep?,uwaterloo,dfzfmf7,2,t5_2rb5s

11662503,0,t1_dgg1yr3,I remember reading a thread about eating cheaply and the advice given was to eat rice cabbage and beans for basically every meal. Could also sub broccoli for cabbage. Lentils are a dirtcheap source of protein so I think  a week might actually be doable if eating the same thing every meal for the next four months doesnt make you want to kill yourself.,uwaterloo,dghyk21,1,t5_2rb5s

11678694,0,t1_dgispt6,Brands are a bit tricky with older bikes. Generally some names too look for are names like Nishiki Panasonic etc japanese names. Peugeot is a good name as well. Because many of these companies sold their brand names after bankruptcy as well as came out with many different models names are typically not a good way to identify a nice bike.Typically you would want to look at the components and etc to identify a nice bike.. All metal forged construction. If anything except the pedals I guess is made of plastic or sheet metal its probably not a good bike. Nice bike frames. If you see the name Easton Tange or Reynolds on a bike its probably good. Otherwise you can also look for the word chrome molybdenum cromoly or double butted. Typically bikes that have these are decent. Note that this is mostly effective looking for vintage bikes.. Brands of components. Look through the components of the bikes and look for Shimano branding. Anything with full metal construction by shimano is fairly decent. If you are sure that the bike is vintage   years old look for the brand name Suntour or Diacompe.Keep in mind that most of this advice is for older bikes.,uwaterloo,dgjsorb,1,t5_2rb5s

11709348,0,t3_672z03,Rape is very very serious. In reference to the post from earlier today the accusations made are significant.  If this truly happened it NEEDS TO BE DEALT WITH. If it is a troll then that troll should think carefully about what heshe finds to be amusing. Banning rape posts is a bad idea. Rape happens and people may be using this subreddit to reach out for help. Putting up fake rape posts to troll or flame the SJWs is also a bad idea. You are really hurting people who may need help if people assume that all rape posts are trolls and you are making fun of something that just isnt funny. ,uwaterloo,dgna8td,6,t5_2rb5s

11745095,0,t3_67l6os,I seriously do not recommend doing this.You do not know the industry at all.Actuarial science is a very specific field and many of the people who come into university wanting to specialize in it realize its not something they like once they take the courses and do a coop term or two in the field.Being a stats major I have no doubt you can nail  of the prelim exams by spending roughly  hours studying for each. less for exam P since its similar to stat  material.Go gain work experience when you graduate. Insurance companies DO higher data analysts and pricing analysts who DO NOT have an actuarial background and have  exams. The fact is the content on actuarial exams isnt what you do in the workplace. If youre good with excel access and writing code you can do the work of an actuary. You just wont be able to progress into management level roles as easily.,uwaterloo,dgrc46p,3,t5_2rb5s
