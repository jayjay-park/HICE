1202225,0,t1_ci4tmq3,Yup TV shows are about the only thing I pirate these days simply because its so hard to find them anywhere. I dont have cable TV. I dont even own a TV. I want to watch TV shows via streaming. Unfortunately even though I want to watch streamed TV shows and Im happy to pay for them content producers apparently do not want my money. These things are just not for sale.Im even okay with watching advertisements while streaming. Its pure marketing gold. Advertisements can be tailored to exactly the person who is interested in watching this content. But its simply not available for any reasonable price. Im not going to buy a TV and buy a cable subscription in order to be able to watch a handful of TV shows. That is just out of the question.So because of this I tend to pirate what isnt on Netflix Hulu or on a networks own website.If its made available for easy convenient streaming at a reasonable price Id be all over it. Fortunately more and more networks are finally getting it through their thick skulls that putting up artificial barriers to potential customers is an idiotic strategy. The amount of content available for legal streaming is still very low but its an improvement over nothing.Major props to Fox for making Cosmos streamable on their website. Its easy to watch and Fox is getting all of the traffic direct to their website. Good on them. I wish more networks would do this for more content.,RimWorld,ci4va0v,1,t5_2yjxo

1788854,0,t3_2exz8g,Good improvement I definately like that they cant shoot in from outside now.  The protected power cables as well. Here are my bits of advice Red  Fill these areas in.  With enough attackers to fill the little sandbag area youll end up having guys run here.  This isnt bad bad but its still going to make them move outside your main kill area.  And the little wall bit would be used as minimal cover against the left and right turrets. Not as massive of an issue but still easy to straighten out.   Green I think the reason youre set on having the entrance be open is time that it takes to get your guys outside.  This can easily be fixed by making a second entrance. Tunnel out the green area run power to it and make a  metal door passageway.  If you fill that whole thing with doors YOUR guys can walk right through THEY cant... it would take them longer to break the doors than to go through the killbox so they go through it.YellowId fill that whole area with sandbags.  I dont want them shooting around the corner I want them in the middle of the room.  Enemies cant shoot standing on sandbags.  It forces them in the room and gives time to shoot them while they cant shoot back! Grey Id make several lines of stockpiles here at least three setup like cover.  Set the stockpile to Critical and only rockslag.  This gives the enemy cover to protect themselves... but its horrible cover compared to sandbags.  Placebo cover....My biggest worry about the design isnt the killbox though... its Theyve dropped right on top of you attacks.  Your main base is open air.  Ive lost more than one base to guys landing past my killbox.  Crappy way to die.,RimWorld,ck4mxot,2,t5_2yjxo

He never judged anybody by their race or sex. Probably because the cataracts prevented him from knowing for sure what they were. We called him Dr. Dolittle  because we once caught him working on a baby muffalo. When asked what he was doing he said These damn youngster colonists and their damn hippie haircuts! Ill show them. over the next week he proceeded to shave every muffalo within the area. This of course drove them mad and they attacked one night injuring three of our colonists.

Dont quote me on this but as I understand it the AI storyteller determines the frequency of events on the basis of how your colony is doing at the moment. In addition Ive read posts by Tynan indicating that a key concept of Rimworld is that all colonies will fail and part of the challengefun is how you fail.Putting two and two together it could be that as your colony gets stable and richer after a year or so I tend to have no problem with money thanks to constant overproduction of food and periodic large devilstrand harvests the story teller tweaks the difficulty by sending you less helpful events.,RimWorld,cleouiv,2,t5_2yjxo

I usually start with medical then prison then individual rooms. Farming starts outside and then moves inside after hydroponics and the crematorium are researched.I didnt used to go killbox but on harder difficulties it seems to be unavoidable for long term success. Lately the orbital beacon goes in the middle of the killbox just to help manage the drops more easily. It usually starts at x  then moves out to the range of the turrets.

2753554,0,t1_cnh28dn,Hey awesome! Great game btw.Restrict to home region would be a good start but not good enough for bases with a welcome mat of turrets and military personnel where civilians want to start repairing sandbags etc. Ideally Id like to be able to designate region zones and be able to restrict some or all of my nonenlisted personnel to those zones. That would not only solve the friendly fire issue during battles but would allow better specialization and direction where I could restrict my clothesmaker to only their bedroom the dining room and their craft bench for instance. Or limit hunterhaulers range to just outside the home region. Or even allow splitting a colony into two totally separate bases. Adding the ability to classify colonists into groups and having each group be able to be zonelimited would help with the micromanagement of that too. I guess regions would also have a nice side effect of making job selection and pathfinding much cheaper for regionlimited personnel Defaulting to nonforbidden in the home region would be great!,RimWorld,cnh2g1h,4,t5_2yjxo
2753789,0,t3_2rlof8,Its been pretty well discussed that there will be no z layers like in Dwarf Fortress. Not even one. Itd take a lot of work to add it in at this point of the game and I do believe Tynan has stated hed rather work on other things... especially since the game already works so well with  layer.The game used to have a happiness  fear system where good acts and pleasant things would increase your colonists happiness and lower their fear where as terrible acts and scary things corpses and the like would raise fear and lower happiness. Basically only one of those two scores had to be over the threshold and your colonist would stick around. The nice bit about this is that people didnt mentally break from hauling bodies or seeing friends die after a skirmish. Their fear was so high they would hold it together to keep alive but fear would drop quickly and you had to raise happiness just as quickly to compensate. However this system wound up getting removed for reasons I really dont know. Im guessing its balance related but I really cant say.,RimWorld,cnh3ekt,7,t5_2yjxo

Except without the beaming technology that spaceships have. How else to explain the disappearance of your goods and orbital drop pods of things you bought. Come to think of it why do they bother buying anything at all? They could just beam colonists off the planet. I digress. Just like a space trader some groups have particular interests extra clothing or seasonal gear weapons medicineColony Gear Loadout Menu  Already discussed this last week on how to implement in game. Visual Colonist User Interface  It brings up a menu like the trader one. But instead it has your st colonist. Not your original st colonist but the st of whos left.Basically you can drag and drop whatever gear you want on said colonist. You drag an item from the left screen Colony stockpiled items into the central box Colonist Loadout Visual Inspection. In the central box their will be smaller boxes for clothing and weapon items. I forget what the stackable limit is for stuff on the Head Arms Torso Legs. Head Helmets Tuques Arms Shirts??? Torso Parkas Armor Shirts Legs PantsLeft Screen  Inventory of colony wide goods in stockpiles Limited to Clothing and weapons Who wants to throw random food and other useless itmes on colonistsMiddle and Centered  Colonist with all clothing and weapons items in small boxes that can dragged and dropped.Right Screen  List of the individual overview and needs. Minimum and maximum temperature range. Armor protection provided by clothing. Speed enhanced or slowed by bionics and clothing. Preference for melee or range weaponry. Is either a fighter or pacifist. Prefers clothing or to be a nudist. Etc...Bottom Screen  Colonist named centered with their number  would be if their the st colonist still alive Not the st colonist from the original three. And arrows to the left and right of their names for the next colonists Comma and period still work to cycle colonist.Final Confirmation  Final check on the loadout screen via stats and a visual inspection. Change options Change now or Before or After bedtimeChange now  Colonist drops everything to change now.Change Before or After Bedtime  Colonist changes before or after bedtime at their earlisest convience.Instead of drafting all of your colonists from their jobs or first thing in the morning when all of them have woken up. And none of them have had their coffee and are trying to runaway to the kitchen to get the first cup. While the game is paused Easiest and simplest way to outfit an entire colony. The game still recognizes the TakenPrioritized action by your colonists regarding clothing and weapons. You dont want your colonists running around nude because the AI thought you had more pants than you catuall did.Radar or Scanner  Space Traders obviously have this technology or amazing optics from orbit. Since they know what you obviously have to sell and how much you can buy.A x utility device that scans all Mechanoids Pirates Tribals on the map. Have this number located maybe above the pause and speed change buttons. Also the overall morale of the group in a bar format. Basically how much you have to hurt them. In order for them to flee from their destructive tendencies.Brings up a popup menu of all the enemies. Lists their armor per person and weapons. Maybe droppables also but that might be to OP. Why? Id like to know if Im dealing with a bunch of mortar teams snipers or melee brawlers.Military Surplus  Weapons and Clothing. Military Surplus gear is far superior than some junk items found at major retail stores nationwide. Ms Ms LMGs are already included in the game.Military clothing would be  more durable  fireproof etc...  Negative Impact on beautyAbility to make or grow Synthread or Hyperweave or both of them I forgot which isnt able to be grown. The ability to craft armor Requires a more advanced bench or just more research.The adding of Elbow and Knee Pads Gloves and Scarves. Fingers are shot off and frostbite is a real option. The ability to wear Power Armor and a parka. Or is there something Im missing in Alpha ?Economic model  With the addition of repairing in Alpha . Would the cost of certain items be more expensive before and during winter. But such items would decrease in value in summer time?

One of the founding three survived dozens of raids and mechanoid attacks several times when it he got hauled out of a burning area unconscious at least once when a raider tried to haul him off and got gunned down moments from escape.Ended up getting his stomach shot clean out by a lucky sniper shot during a siege. No other wounds just his stomach pulverized.Took him home laid him on the medical bed realized the game didnt have a way to replace a stomach. Promptly tore all of his limbs off euthanized him shoved him in a grave and stuck all of the parts on his apprentice the second best medic.

3783573,0,t1_cqnid35,gt I think people really undervalue the valueadd of Steam.Yes and no. I cant speak for other people on this point but Id agree that the value Steam adds is huge. However so is the value electricity adds to a home and the value digital payments e.g. credit cards add to retailing. Just because something adds a lot of value does not ethically give the value adder carte blanche to charge whatever the market will bear and keep whatever percentage they can squeeze from everyone else suppliers and customers.gt Content creation is but a small part of running any business.This is very true. If Steam did a bit more of the backend heavy lifting then I could start to see that perspective. For now I am not seeing Steam as replacing advertising and marketing a huge portion of content businesses yet. It doesnt actually bring targeted suggestions to people its just an echo chamber of what is popular. Making things available on the internet is relatively trivial so I wouldnt say Steam is extra special in that regard. Processing online payments isnt exactly unique either. That isnt to say that there isnt still a lot of value being added I just dont think its enough to justify claiming more than  of total effortrevenue.gt The work that goes into making a mod any mod it doesnt matter which one is but a fraction of the total amount of work that went into making everything that the mod depends on.Yes but that work should already have been compensated when the original game purchase was made.

The only locks that they could pick would be if you locked the doors yourself. The doors just dont open normally for them. So lockpicking couldnt be a skill because if its your own member it couldnt even be used. gt The highest skilled ones could show up and attempt to assassinate a favored colonist. How would the favoured colonist be decided? And rimworld alerts you to events its more like Heres a problem what will you do? then that. No cloak and dagger in rimworld really. Plus as soon as you notice them in your base which you would easily you could lock the doors I guess thats where your lockpicking comes in? draft everyone with a weapon and brutally murder the person or capture them. Plus turrets. You always have turrets by your base. gt If we ever have children it seems odd this is missing they could attempt to kidnap them and hold them for ransom or in exchange for a demand.Time which people seem to forget exists in Rimworld. You spend generally a few years in order to complete the game not enough time to concern yourself with having people mate which would be entirely useless and would have no point in the game as this isnt the sims and a child wouldnt have enough time to become useful at all. As for the guard animals I actually agree with you there. Apparently theres a wolf event in alpha  wolfs would be the ideal animal to tame and create guard dogs with. Having to bring your melee fighters to position and risk themselves greatly sucks being able to have an animal you have to feed but would be able to hunt and guard a location would be fantastic.

5696643,0,t3_3t4z3b,Thanks for this!One minor question though I dont see any nutrition data for roses or daylilies. Ive been experimenting with using Daylily farms to serve as a replacement for my cattlechickenspigsmegascarabs to eat. Their increased growth rate and ability to spread without colonist intervention makes them attractive to me but this table might refute that if I had some nutrition info. Thanks! Edit Also I believe that the long growth time for Corn is actually a benefit rather than a drawback. Because the growth period is much much longerx that of rice much less time is spent by colonists sowing and harvesting which allows for much larger fields to be sown. With larger fields you hedge your bets against blights and if youre like me and you play stone tile walkways between your fields you also significantly reduce the chance of fires taking everything out.

And I play with a seed mod because I think its unbelievable that stranded colonists have ready access to infinite seeds for farming so losing plants is a big deal.

6401490,0,t3_43cq6c,you should first learn the basics so play a few times without mods until you understand the game despite it seeming to be simple and easy this game is quite indepth from colonists mood to using cover during gunfights.as soon as you get that down you can look in the official game forum and pick whichever mods would suite your playstyle. oh and one more thing there is not a single mod that is essential and everyone will tell you differently about which mods are essential or not depending on the persons preferences.,RimWorld,czha9d0,1,t5_2yjxo
6422196,0,t1_czjj74h,I think its a bit too random actually. Maybe I am to blame for this but I am sure I am not the only one. Whenever I start a new game I sit for like  minutes randoming the colonists until I get the perfect team. The perfect team for me is one that among the three has  in every important stat so two  per col who are able to do every task are perfectly healthy and has no really bad attributes. Generally I look for a Warrior with with  ShootingCooking a Doctor with  MedicineSocial and a Worker with  ConstructionMining. These conditions are pretty high but its doable it just takes time randoming.Again maybe it is just me but I always feel guilty for doing this for  min almost feeling like I am cheating getting such a perfect starting team.I think it would be much more interesting and fair if the colonist creation followed a set of rules like in most RPGs. That you have lets say  stat points to give out. A good attribute cost  a bad attribute instead give you  points to use. Same with health for every injury you are given more points to use on stats. Maybe your Doctor doesnt have to be a fast walker or a good shot give her another  points in medicine instead etc. This would lead to more thinking and strategy and less of bashing the random button. The con would be that your games would be more similar it can be fun with some random elements in a game too. ,RimWorld,czjlb0g,1,t5_2yjxo

I get that Tynan is trying to calculate heat for a whole room at a time rather than per tile that would take way too much processing power but it doesnt really make sense that a single tile of fire causes a room to become hotter than the surface of Venus in a few seconds flat or that breaking down a single wall removes all the heat instantly.,RimWorld,d1xk7bx,2,t5_2yjxo

Im sure uTynanSylvester is reading anyway.gt which Ive noticed is weirdly inconsistent Sometimes itll build a full stack sometimes itll walk right over another resource without adding it to a partial stackthis is because it seeks a location to drop the goods so often it will grab just enough to complete a stack elsewhere. This in itself is also ... annoying. Its been improved though  if the colonist can find a secondary location to drop itll carry as much as it can and overflow to the next spot.

We were all beginners when I started and so its always been a learning process. It could be interesting to see how beginner videos look!gtFound your info about stockpiling really interesting. What sort of size stockpiles do you have next to benches? Do you go for just one square? Or something a bit bigger like a small store room? Totally depends on the speed of whats being created.  Art takes a long time so a x is plenty haulers will restock it before they finish.  Fast work like stonecutting should be larger like x or more if your dump is far away.  The goal is to have the items replaced before the crafters need them again.  And it lets you pack more crafting into the area around toolboxs for the speed boost.gtRe Killboxes. I rarely get through a raid without getting injuries so will also put a bit more thought into killboxes. Any general principles I should follow?Knowing how the AI thinks is key.  They cant fire standing in sandbags they want to fire from cover they attack thats they have a better shot at etc.Thats my design midgame room for six more guns from when I took that picture.  The L shapes by the guns keep repair people safe whole they fix guns under fire.  The chairs allow my guys to remain comfy for long fights.  The doors keep raiders from blowing up a gun and running up the side to fight me.  The rocks give them shitty cover so they dont rush me They stop and fight in the middle.Everyone has a design that works for them and this one is what has grown from my experiences.

If a pawns performance would degrade as his mood declines you bet people would be trying to optimize it and boost it. That is to say a pawn thats about to break down will be as productive and effective as a pawn thats incredibly happy. And aside from less risk Im not reaping any benefits from the increased happiness in the pawn. We get no productivity boosts no productivity penalties or other factors aside from the breaks.

Making a bedroom impressive is easy and its a nice way to bleed off wealth which is a huge factor of the game. For Freezers use dual doors for temperature control. Likewise having an ugly room does decrease speed in that it will require that happiness to be offset.

8812290,0,t3_50uqra,Here are a couple of ideasAlarms.  Either silent or nonsilent but they provide an alert that colonists should move either to or from an area. Spike pit. This would be a trap that causes damage and does not need to be reset. This would do damage to anyone or anything trythat steps on it including friendly. Some sort of stun trap. Chemical weapons. Use the explosiveincendiary IED trap but instead a small chemical cloud is created that hana in place for a few hours. This would not damage mechanoids. Possibly your pawns could be upset at the use of chemical weapons. Toe poppers. If you are creating landmines you could include a variant that is small and designed to injure by blowing up a foot. Again. I think it would be okay if pawns are unhappy about having landmines placed near home tiles. Human remains.

8854781,0,t3_51fz9v,Its only on Cassandra classic that I constantly start getting events. Sounds like if you need more breather time you should switch to Chillax storyteller while in in game options. The difficulty setting doesnt affect the rate at which you get events mostly. Before I build into mountains or hills I usually have to roll a relatively good miner first to start. Then I build two rooms using wood for the dining hall and one for the shared bedroom. Now if you just keep everything clean use wooden floorboards their debuffs wont be too problematic. The Disturb sleep is for when another pawn is moving within  or so squares of the sleeping pawn so if you put beds at opposite locations in a large room it can compensate for sharing a bedroom. Generally if you are digging a cave your big concern is dirt and hauling those rocks out. So setting your stores close enough that  you can protect them is vital in the beginning. Too far and you waste time. Too close and your pawns will see the ugly and become depressed.A big issue in controlling each pawn is the manual priorities. As others have mentioned when you want a pawn to do an activity set the manual to . It will then do each activity named  from left to right then start on . Micromanaging more than  pawns this way is problematic later on but for  in the beginning you can save a lot of time.Whether you prioritize getting a field going or not will depend on your biome. I like Arid biomes for growing a lot of things. If you are going for winter types you will need rice and then later a heating solution.As for clothing you just need to level up a grower to  and then grow cotton. Or spend a long time taming animals for their wool like muffalo. Thus it is much easier to start on Arid or Temperate biomes where you have long season to grow.A trick on icy or  month growing season biomes is to build indoor fields using a sunlight. Heating it and the bedrooms becomes easier. Its a lot harder to plan for raiders if you dont have your base building abilities up to snuff on the biome or have slightly wrong pawn skills.For defense the survival rifle is great early game. Clear out the trees so they cant use them as cover. Put down a stockpile of just rocks in front of your sandbages. I use a layered approach with one sandbag one wooden wall one sandbag and a door behind the sandbag. That allows me to retreat from the sandbag. This reduces your use of steel while providing more coverage on a front. Removing rocks and trees are important because enemies will use them as cover. Even  cover might make the difference between you getting downed vs wiping out the enemy without taking a single casualty. The shooter is also great leveling up while hunting. More misses more skill pts. The quality of clothing is based on the crafting skill I think. Same for the quality of furniture based on construction. So you want to make sure theres only one pawn that specializes in each. Or get a double flame passion guy to do it. You want to power level that one guy up. Should be do able even if they have one flame and level  to start with. Once you get level  in craftingconstruction you will be making mostly normal and some good products. Hunting is normally so you can get meat and mix it to get lavish meals.The quality isnt why they complain it is the  of hitpoints left. So anything less than  is going to be tattered should sell those to traders.If you are starting with the  drop pod scenario I would push research for pemmican or passive coolers if on hot biomes. Getting a working freezer in time connected to the base defenses is rather creative due to the context of the spawn environment. Instead of building for electricity I found it was a lot easier just to get wood and use neolithic technologies. Pemmican doesnt spoil and thats nice if you dont want to cook or grow rice. Strawberries are also good since they dont have the raw food debuff.I normally dont buy things from traders which I can make myself. Bionic upgrades drug components is about it. I sell to trader a lot to get silver.The smokeleaf grow strategy is also good but you need some time for that and some growing space. Could be hard on certain biomes. Beer is a little complicated to make now but gives an immediate buff to mood without much addiction. Thats something at the  pawn stage though.Instead of building with steel try wood. Replace with steel for your outer defenses that they hit with fire a lot.Also if you ever use the wind mill and solar panel open strategies the raiders will usually head straight there or to your fields to burn it if they dont come in the usual direction. So thats one way to lure them in.Later on I got some pretty good meat shields in Rhinoceros and Muffalo tamed animals with the animal skill. It was actually  muffalos and a cougar fighting on my side blocking the  rampaging elephants that I was able to kill them one by one using a shotgun and a survival rifle. A Pistol and some melee. I was hiding in my base at the time waiting for them to go away. Cougars and other predators stun on hit. Their attack speeds are also good enough that it seems to interrupt people using firearms more. So its not impossible to start a game with one  animal trainer and get a predator or big animal tamed in a few days if you have extra food around. Thats much more powerful than a few turrets even.,RimWorld,d7c7wpn,2,t5_2yjxo

Theres a good chance a number of your raids are from the pirate colony and you just never realized it.Next time raiders show up select one and see what town  faction they belong to then check the name on the Factions screen.On a side note if y ou get tired of being invaded by triabls and theyre not the pirate faction you can get them to friendly by catching downed raiders healing them up then releasing them to go back home. Every one that reaches the edge of the map gives you  reputation and once they hit a certain point theyll stop raiding you.Pirates however will never stop raiding. Theyre intended to always be a way to give the player some conflict. So pirate prisoners do whatever you want with them and there will be no consequences.As for the raiders going for anything but the killbox Try walling off everything preferably with granite it has the highest durability if you havent already. Even if you think the death route looks the best its possible the raider AI doesnt and they just go where they want.

Theyre more efficient in smaller areas with less walking travel. Temporary storage zones for stone chunks are good. Hauling and cleaning in strategic areas can make a big difference in your pawns moods.Build a small table early and stools so people can sit and eat but only if you absolutely have to.

These raids are smaller than normal pirate raids and they usually lack any form of armor. Your base might take a little molotov damage but you should be ok if you back up and form up your fighters.Against triple rocket launchers you want stone bunkers with doors snipers or use artifacts like insanity or shock lance.

Look at Dwarf Fortress youd think that at some point you run out of content but thats when you start getting into megaprojects try to accomplish weird objectives like dropping a capsule into the circus building minecart shotguns calculators aboveground lava tanks making items out of specific materials etc.Rimworld has a few problems which hurt that It lacks variety to explore  e.g. most leathers have identical stats and prices and exotic animals arent particularly better to breed. Certain ways of making money are orders of magnitude better than others which if not forces strongly pushes you towards a certain metagame. It  has a relative lack of rare and quirky content to spice things up  like weird crazy implantsbionics from glitterwords like wheeled feet that are fast as shit but trip constantly on uneven terrain. It also focuses on having a relatively controlled game structure which means that it doesnt have as many different various furniturebuildingitem types as it could if it didnt care that refrigerators might make food management too simple it has a growthbased economy which means that trading has to be purposely gimped by crazy bad prices it has stupid AI that needs to throw numbers at you to stand a chance which prevents more interesting threats like persistent bloodthirstybutnotmanhunting animals or enemy factions trying to set up a minicolony on your own map. Or tribals not being different traits than towns  they should be unable to use comms consoles have different currency and prices for things etc. I also really dislike raw materials being worth and counting so much towards wealth. It makes your wealth just climb up and up without you actually accomplishing anything substantial which is kinda lame.And even beyond what is essentially complaints you could improve upon the games variety by making different crops have many various properties and require seeds to prevent just plant the best crop situations allow making custom alcoholdrugs from your plants of choice switching research to a generalized knowledge system where knowledge is codified as tabletsbooksdisks that pawns can study individually  and individually become proficient in as skills of sorts so you may very well start the game being unable to build anything except log walls or having to trade in order to acquire knowledge of different technological level than your ones which would change how the game itself is played between tribalssettlerscolonists or any other archetype you might wish to define or depending on what tech you gain access to.

Were they all in the same ancient danger? Because if not maybe they spawn when the room is opened up. Just spitballing here.

9630288,0,t1_d9zlz01,If you look at some information tab for the colonists I wanna say the gear tab but Im not ingame right now so I cant check there should be a thing that says comfortable temperature range ff or something to that effect thats a pretty wide range but for the sake of the point Im making....Depending on the climate of the map youll want to have the temperature control that offsets it. I personally like to use vents to connect every room except the freezer which I double wall for extra insulation and then have a couple heaters andor coolers scattered around that I manually switch on and off per season that control the temp of the whole base.Little off topic but I find its also a great idea to make a kind of airlock outside of the freezer and any other room you want to keep at a specific temperature its just like it sounds a tiny little hallway like one or two squares that leads to the room. It equalizes the temperature between the two rooms it connects to and keeps the juxtaposition from rapidly changing the temp in either room whenever a colonist travels between them.,RimWorld,da04q0m,1,t5_2yjxo

At work I wanted to play in a window with the sound off.So I set this up my symlinks at home first and then I set it up at work. However before I launched the game at work I went into the RimWorldGame DataConfig folder in Dropbox and renamed Prefs.xml to Prefs.xml.home. I then launched the game at work. It creates a new Prefs.xml file. Then I can set it up to play in a smaller window with the sound off. When I got back home Id go into that folder and rename the new Prefs.xml file Prefs.xml.work and rename Prefs.xml.home back to Prefs.xml.

Which Ive seen leading to Muffalo blacking out and while blacked out they lose all of the hunger they sated by binge drinking meaning when they wake up they are desperately hungry again and guess what food is the closest to them. Its a vicious cycle.Its why I wish Tynan would remove alcohol from the list of food animals can consume. Since there is no way to stop an animal from doing something midaction like how you can stop a pawn from doing something by drafting them you cant stop animals from consuming anything marked as food unless you set up multiple zones and or stockpiles that the animals cannot access.

Use fueled generators. They are often over looked but having  just in case of eclipse or outages is great.  The more power you have stored in batteries the larger a zzzt even is.

They even get a small fraction of the artifacts which their tribe discovered throughout the time it existed.A fair few incidents are created including both varities of mechanites on day  and psychic soothe a day after that because of the pain and mood penalty with it. Its really too long to put down into a single reply.I also changed a fair few multipliers affecting combat work research and trading. Theres a  chance that the starting people will permanently have the Luciferium effect due to anomalies in the transportation and a  chance of luciferium need. Theyll always start with a low severity of toxic buildup not severe enough for carcinoma or dementia and a hangover.You also start with a Thrumbo which you can do as you wish with it. Its effectively almost as if youve got a whole new storyteller.I might change it so that the scenarios in a ZIP file with a text document detailing the scenario whichll take a long time to write down and another text document including an installation guide for people new to scenario adding.For some reason it wont let me post a link and description at the same time itll just freeze.,RimWorld,dbsjty9,2,t5_2yjxo

My current game i have a reasonable turkey farm going but i just slaughter the babies since they take two fucking years to grow to adulthoodEdit Rice in Hydroponics is probably the best way of supplying a lot of colonists with year round food but it is very power hungry. Alternatively you can wall up some normal soil put a Sun Lamp and some heaters in so the crops will grow all year round.

Maybe tweak sales prices a bit and make production in general more work seems a bit easy to mass produce some things like joints  cotton clothing  etc.Also maybe more stuff we have to buy from merchants the medicine efficiency reduction is good but it doesnt really help with money overflow because there is simply no glitterworld stuff to buy from most merchants and even if they had i can only operate so many times. Things like tools luxury goods etc that deteriorate would help a lot let us craft the simply variant of it but only get the good stuff from looting  trade.cottonspinning should be a thing would reduce the amount of clothing you can produce by a lot.

10264622,0,t3_5mzjmc,Keeping the Jade Knife to sell and getting some useful items is a better idea than simply leaving it there. The additional pawns are the biggest problem to tribes.Assuming Intense difficulty and that you dont build anything.Raid  | Incident Points w Knife | Incident Points wo Knife|| |  |  |   is from pawns |   is from pawns |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | The difference of the points may equal one more raider at best.In lower difficulties getting rid of the knife may not lower the raid strength enough to cause a noticeable difference and because those values assume you do not build mine or collect anything and ignore that fact raid strength also increases with time the knife really is not going to make a lot of difference and you could use those  silver to buy something useful.The same can be said about pemmican but unlike the knife pemmican may make a difference in raid strength if you produce it like theres no tomorrow.EDIT Another thing to note is that the ingredients to make pemmican have a market value too and will increase wealth accordingly. A more effective way to reduce the strength of raids very slightly is by not collecting ingredients you wont need at all.,RimWorld,dc7ju7v,27,t5_2yjxo

Youd have to somehow synchronize most things happening in the game between the two players.  The positions of all pawns all objects and their statuses etc.    If one player orders a pawn somewhere the same action needs to happen in the other players client.    You also cant have an event happen on one players client but a different event on the other players computer.    I guess some sort of seedbased RNG system could work for that though.  Of course there would also need to be an actual system for handling lag.  A localmultiplayer mod  players on  computer would probably be a lot easier to make.,RimWorld,dc7rczk,3,t5_2yjxo

Say you want to pack a lot of food first e.g  berries works for any item and then  cloth but your colonists keep mindlessly hauling until failure. Do the following Open form caravan menu from World and select the colonists andor muffalos you want to take Find the berries or your itemsfoods of choice and overshoot the quantity were packing  berries so select  to give you some time Let your colonists pack the stuff. If they get tiredhungry in the process at any time cancel the packing by clicking the packing colonist and selecting the option close to the draft button. Start packing again using the same steps above check the gear in the muffalos first so you can adjust the item safe zone. When you get to  or so berries or items of choice cancel the packing immediately. Let your colonists resteathave fun.

That means that a room can be  tiles wide a th roof tile would be gt  tiles removed from either wall.Which means that as long as one of the rooms dimensions is  or less not counting walls then you can build it as long as you want in the other dimension.  E.g. a x room works just as well as a x room. But a x room would have a collapsing roof in the middle.Note thay you can completely ignore the tile limit if you use pillars. Try using stone blocks for pillars you dont want your roof collapsing in on you during a fire.   What I tend to do is build a little room x not counting walls in the middle of a larger room. That allows for a significantly larger exterior room and the little room can be unroofed and used for the coolers exhaust and e.g. the landing zone for orbital traders.TLDR Keep one room dimension at  or lower to prevent roof collapses. Use pillars if you want to build bigger.,RimWorld,dchpves,3,t5_2yjxo

Maybe thats why we crash landed and get escape pods... poorlyreprogrammed mechanoid cores! Even if it wasnt its not teleporting away but instead being used as a sort of beacon for the landing. It doesnt handle the teleporting the A.I. on the mothership does. The one we scavenge is more basic meant only to work as a way to calculate the targeted colonys defenses required invasion force and chance of success based on both.In addition the teleporting is being done on incredibly durable machine constructs not organic matter.

Usually when I mine a ship I use  or  for a thorough job. So for  mines thats  steel. That means it becomes cheaper to use the mortar technique if mortars can get the job done in fewer than  shells. So just how ineffective is mortar use? I wonder if its cheaper or not.,RimWorld,dd96pei,4,t5_2yjxo

10613108,0,t1_ddajvx4,All you need is a good defense. The game incorrectly teaches you to use sandbags a much better cover is a wall with a  block opening for your men to shoot through. This is a decent example put ranged people behind the walls so they are near impossible to hit. If enemies get to close have some melee people take over.Though I would remove the sandbox in the middle and place a bunch of traps kind of like a minefield. This can be used with bows but its best to use automatic rifles paired with one or two miniguns and two snipers. Not sure about the lategame. ,RimWorld,ddantc6,4,t5_2yjxo

10729257,0,t3_5thyv9,This happened to me todayHad a colony that was struggling but just getting over the hump. Food was plentiful but getting enough wood to power the generators was always a struggle but our six colonists were living a decent life. Then an infection hit. One died. Then another. Then a third and fourth. Then right after a raid downed the fifth and sixth. The raider decided to kidnap one of the colonists. Writhing in pain she wriggled free of the raiders grasp and started punching her attacker. She was no match though and after taking another shot with a club she was abducted. Meantime our last lonely colonists was prone on the ground hoping for a miracle. Instead he caught fire from the raiders incendiary launcher from during the fight that spread over him. He burned to death in that spot. The colony was dead. Still alive though were the colonys three prisoners. Two of them had had their legs blown off and were immobile for sometime. The third slowly went stir crazy trapped behind three granite doors. Eventually one of the crippled prisoners passed away from starvation. He was promptly eaten by the mobile prisoner. The same thing happened when the second cripple died. It seemed that the mobile prisoner might get by by feasting on the rather large corpsesbut with nobody feeding the generators and winter quickly approaching the prison temperature soon headed to F and he died of hypothermia. Soon after a sole refugee came by the colony and decided to set up shop. He was then joined by another and another to rebuild what had once been lost.

They all had iron will to hopefully prevent that but.. we .. I thought about canibalizing one of them but it seemed like survival wasnt happening. There was a whole  wood on the map from cactus so a panic room or anything air conditioned w a simple cooler wouldnt work for very long. After selling the jade for  I debated buying wood and  cowboy hats Thats the best clothes they had plus whatever I could for food. That might give me a fighting chance and I could start another colony in one of the next tiles hoping for better resources. This was the initial idea of being nomads and MAYBE it would work.

The game is also more likely to pick the more moutainy areas and darker areas.Typically what I do is only keep hydroponics farms and freezers indoors. The former is always  lit and the freezers are lower than C. Thisll keep your food production safe from mortar attacks while the extra layers of rock is helpful for insulating the freezer. You could also just do warehouses at C or more. By process of elimination you can force them to spawn outside these controlled environments.If you dont really mine out mountains then its pretty much a given theyll spawn in the only available room you set aside for the explicit purpose of managing infestations. You can trap that room. Theres a lot of way to set up traps. You can set up a room full of heaters freezers turrets or just flammable wooden walls . . .Otherwise theyll just spawn in your extensive mining network which are pretty easy to burn out anyway.,RimWorld,dfxzuwx,2,t5_2yjxo

11554719,0,t3_64l0b9,I use bunkers. First I wall off chokepoints then in the middle I make a room with pillars and sandbags and put a roof over it. This makes my pawns harder to hit. Then  I make sure the area in front doesnt offer defensive spots for the attackers. I clear chunks trees and even make sure the hill walls dont have hiding spots. If they do I put traps at those spots. This can effectively stop enemies with guns. But rocket launchers can make short work of the entire bunker. Also melee enemies will rush the defenders you will need strong melee pawns in the bunker in which case the singletile shooting hole is a miniature chokepoint in itself. Could enhance it with rows of chunks to slow advancing of the enemies down but this would also give them bonuses. Never played around with IEDs or mortar support though they might help.Mechanoids are also problematic as scythers outrange most guns and centipedes have a prime target with concentraded colonists.

11739090,0,t3_67if5w,Yeah as soon as you have a decent amount of people you should have some lackeys set only to do menial tasks like hauling if cleaning is an issue convert one of them in to a full time cleaner. Ive heard having firefighting on all of your characters using quite a bit of cpu time its better to have it on a few unimportant characters than on all of them. Put down firefoam poppers at critical areas for security.Youve got two options when it comes to damaged clothing sell it or burn it. You can manually set the crematorium to only burn things below a set percentage of damageWork order priority is exactly that a priority list. It will do the first task until it has been met or there isnt enough materials it then does the second until its finished or there isnt enough materials. As i understand it if the materials become available for a task higher in the priority list it should do that as soon as it can.,RimWorld,dgqnmc8,4,t5_2yjxo

11784647,0,t3_6839u4,The worst colonist I had was the seeminglynormal miner who for reasons Im still unclear on decided to pick fights with absolutely everyone else in the colony and managed to permanently injure two of my most useful colonists.A close second was the colonist who was incapable of skilled labor dumb labor and firefighting.  Plus dementia and a wakeup addiction.  The only reason they didnt take first place is because they were so obviously worthless that I was able to ship them off to the north pole before they could consume any resources.As for the worst I can imagine... I suppose a drugaddicted abrasive pyromaniac with multiple prohibited labors no useful skills and an irrational rivalry with everyone in my colony would fit the bill.  Throw in high melee skill for causing damage in social fights but an aversion towards combat so they wont actually help defend the colony.,RimWorld,dgvtu0m,6,t5_2yjxo
