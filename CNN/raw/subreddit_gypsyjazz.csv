1174839,0,t1_ci1l5j0,Manouche does translate to Gypsy in English so Django himself basically called the music Gypsy Jazz. The genres name has been accepted for so long now in addition to being coined by a Romani himself that its a bit ridiculous to suddenly decide its offensive.Django and many other musicians most likely would have had no issue with the term but you can find people of Romani descent who would object as well as finding people who would be fine with it. ,gypsyjazz,ci1sfih,3,t5_2sel3
