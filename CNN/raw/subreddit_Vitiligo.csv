1144774,0,t3_2784ay,my facial spots began at the corners of my mouth and around my eyes..That does look like vitiligo but the placement isnt quite what Id expect.  Based on living with it for years now it seems to be worst on areas of skin that have a lot of activity or wear and tear.  such as corners of mouth eyes hands elbows.Your doctor will probably prescribe some cream to rule out fungus certain fungus can cause that symptom,Vitiligo,chyedjl,1,t5_2s0bv

1419348,0,t3_2adgwl,i was in fourth grade when it first started. i believe i was  years old as well. the spots also first appeared on my hips I had a rather large scab that fell off and the spots spread from there and then spread to my legs feet and face. the last of the spots disappeared towards the end of my high school years. people really dont give the spots much thought unless you are very dark. my spots were pretty conspicuous but luckily i never was selfconscious about it and they didnt affect my quality of life.i feel like there arent many viable treatment options out there because it is really a very nonintrusive disease.  if the spots dont bother you i wouldnt worry about it too much. itll probably disappear as you get older. i dont think there will be much point in getting extensive treatment. stress will make it worse P relax and let it play out!,Vitiligo,ciu6z8v,2,t5_2s0bv
1441676,0,t3_2alds9,I did this. I got better but it came back after a few months. You have to sort out your internal imbalance first....somehow!,Vitiligo,ciwzns3,2,t5_2s0bv

4875715,0,t3_3hl3s5,. I think its true on some level but not really.  I think it continues but its too hard to constantly track and notice your vitiligo.  In periods of stress my vitiligo will begin to spread.  It also seems to have some timeline every  years I feel like it spreads more but those times could be related to stress as they were all transitional periods of my life.. Dermovate the steroid cream was most effective at new spots.  I had a watch band rubbing my hand it started causing vitiligo in that area.  A week with cream completely gone and never came  back.  Tacrolimus doesnt seem to be working and the ointment causes me to break out a bit whereever its applied.. I feel like it might have staved some of it off when it started progressing.  I also think that it caused some hyperpigmentation though too.  Overall Im not really satisfied with any treatments Ive had except Dermovate which felt like you had to use it when you first noticed a spot.  You can only use it  weeks max because it thins your skin.Good luck!  Its a frustrating thing both the condition and treatment options.,Vitiligo,cu94f2z,2,t5_2s0bv
4937644,0,t3_3ig0md,They arent directly related but with some people if you have something rub your skin alot or if you get a scrape or sore when it heals the color will not come back with the new skin.,Vitiligo,cugxh3h,2,t5_2s0bv

6637029,0,t1_czp2p61,They do fade in time. I have been using tacrolimus for a while. The patches tend to come back.,Vitiligo,d05tq92,1,t5_2s0bv
9598537,0,t3_569ea7,I had one or two small spots for years with no growth my face got some new ones after some time in the sun and over the next month I would wake up every morning with a little more character. That was about  years ago Ive got some new spots popping up on my arms and theyve all come in suddenly. My hands however have had some areas thatve faded over time so I guess it could go either way. ,Vitiligo,d9w7s7t,1,t5_2s0bv
10976880,0,t3_5wn8nq,I did for a while  but not enough to matter. Not sure about what black label warnings youre talking about though is that a US thing?,Vitiligo,dec7q57,1,t5_2s0bv
