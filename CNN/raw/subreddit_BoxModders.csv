3104173,0,t3_2vpg70,My other boxes have chips in them.  This one has a mosfet but I would like to add low voltage protection.  How to add that?  I should have at least added a voltmeter but the space was tight.  Think I can add it next time if Im careful.  Next one is an OKR T mod with dual  safety batteries.  ,BoxModders,cojqvn2,1,t5_35kbq
