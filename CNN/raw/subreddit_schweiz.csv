405748,0,t1_cfmtjlm,Honestly I think its been one of the best weekends in ages for snowboardingskiing. There were massive traffic jams on the way back North from GR in the evening too so I guess all of Switzerland was up in the mountains D,schweiz,cfmtlrd,2,t5_2sp82
709353,0,t1_cgkw8ba,Ive only been to the area twice last weekend and another time about four years ago. In  we took the cable car up to the top of Ebenalp and hiked down which was really interesting. There are quite a few trails on the area so plenty to chose from. Check out this site for some more better information.,schweiz,cgkwnaz,1,t5_2sp82
