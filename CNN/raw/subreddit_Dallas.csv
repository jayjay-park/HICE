197518,0,t1_cf0x491,Very true. But in an emergency room setting how often will you see the same doctor? It would not happen in a primary care setting where a relationship and medical information is established. The ER is to triage treat and transfer care to have appropriate followup. Its a messed up system where the provider will likely believe the history but will proceed in a defensive manner as worse case scenarios happen. Abdominal pain also warrants blood work and a urinalysis in the emergency room even if it was okay yesterday. That was yesterday and today is different. ,Dallas,cf0xu3i,2,t5_2qnkr

Background  I once gave away  very very good tickets to the Dodgers in exchange for a Kings Jersey and three beers via rlosangeles.  I havent tried anything like this since moving here except for when I tried to give away free moving boxes and it took like two weeks cause apparently no one reads the free section on Craigslist.  So make your best offer rdallas.Also I will give you some additional gardening stuff that may or may not have anything to do with indoor plants and by that I mean it doesnt... its stuff like Roundup and other chemical crap I dont use an outdoor bird bath and other things along those lines.  You dont have to take the other crap if you dont want it.These plants have to be out of the house before my wife comes home because weve been trying to figure out what to do about them for far far too long.

752852,0,t3_22s30l,I went to Zera coffee shop in Denton one time for a coffee date.Im a dude with piercings and weird clothes so I tend to avoid most religious places as they do make me uncomfortable. However I was unaware that Zera was mainly a Christian coffee shop. Immediately upon entering I was getting weird stares and vibes but didnt think too much of it. Grabbed some coffee and began conversing with my date. Somewhere along the lines I said ass. It was such an insignificant and common word that I dont even remember the context. Big ears somehow overheard me say the vile abominable word and felt a need to address the situation. After minutes of stares and whispers a man from a table near us approached me. By his demeanor you would have thought he was going to punch me. Instead he interrupted my date to tell me watch my language and then went on a minirant about how disrespectful and inconsiderate of me it was to say the dreadful word... Ass.There are MANY things wrong with this situation. To name a fewI was having a private lowvolume conversation. He would have had to be intentionally eavesdropping waiting for me to fuck up woopsies in his territory.There werent even children at his table. Not that it would have mattered but thats literally the only logical reason for him to approach me like so.He approached me in a very direct and aggressive manner without even questioning the circumstances of the situation.He interrupted my date to insult me.I was very mature in handling the situation and apologized to end the confrontation quickly. That said I wanted to hook him in the face right then and there but I wasnt about to give him the glory of being a victim.Needless to say I havent been back. The date ended up falling through a few weeks later but we had some good laughs about that unfortunate coffee date.,Dallas,cgputk2,33,t5_2qnkr

It seems like its kind of like starting a school district from scratch new charter and they get to come up with their own rules and structure as opposed to the state dictating them.

Of course all this is purely anecdotal but its the same feeling I get when I interact with people from Coppell. I guess I should emphasize that I dont think that everyone is Las Colinas is pretentious but whenever people talk about Irving its always Dont go south of Las Colinas or Dont go south of  as if the rest of Irving is a leper colony.

1393457,0,t1_ciqw0j1,Its an easy solution on paper but much harder than you would expect. Theres disease criminals drug lords smugglers... people of all walks of life and backgrounds coming into this country. Illegally. Thats the thing that gets me the most  itll take years to become an actual citizen of the US but waltzing in here illegally is going to be fine and honky dory or youre considered a racist.Im sorry that you have an aunt like that. Im the unicorn in my family being a tolerant logical sane centrist out of a group of backwoods republicans. I dont oppose illegal immigration because of the same reasons and excuses that my family does takin er jeurbs derogatory slurs that are supposed to signify something etc. but because I saw first hand what it can do to a community and what an influx of illegal immigrants could potentially do to an entire state.Take my username with a grain of salt. My hometown was a predominantly middleclass blue collar town mixed with a bit of tourism and a lot of people treating it like a bedroom community. In the early days it was comprised of poor farmers making a living and establishing a community and a way of life. They worked hard in the fields and raised their children to do better in their own lives. So they did. They created a thriving city with factories businesses and organizations all run and managed either by prospectors far and wide or homegrown entrepreneurs. My grandfather is a shining example of that he started off as a custodian at a textile mill. He met my grandmother then climbed the ranks and started his own business. His grandchildren lived comfortably because of the sacrifices he took as a young adult and of the hardship he endured on the farms. This is a similar story that many rd or th generation migrants may share but theres something in common with all of us  were migrants. The same stories can be told by these migrants coming in from the south but theres an overwhelming and overbearing fact that scares me the most disregard for society and criminals establishing empires in communities like my hometown.In the past  years these industries finally expanded. A new industrial park was built and companies like Sterelite and SherinWilliams started popping up. There were too many openings and not enough people to fill in the jobs. Those who did arrive were low income migrants  much like our great grandparents. However nothing has changed. Very few of these migrants improved in their next generation. In fact it seems as if its worsened. Entire portions of the community became derelict as low income families brought crime and drug trade with them. However those who were the criminals and leech off of society are in the minority. Many of the immigrants are barely making a living and are trying to make a new life but their lack of documentation places them in the same category as these criminals  illegal immigrants.There are good natured people out there trying to make a living in a new world much like our ancestors. The things that makes the two examples completely different is the overbearing risk of criminal activity. Murder and robbery rates have escalated in my hometown. Companies and families are fleeing to find a living elsewhere. While the city has enough tax revenue from those who stayed they neglect to improve the community and the potholedriddled streets making the town even worse. The city is in a spiraling stall and the influx of crime and poverty contributed to that. However we have improved quite a bit. Festivals are much more popular culture of Hispanic descent is beginning to bring back color to our community and crime rates have begun to drop. But now a whole new wave is coming  and its coming straight to communities like my hometown....Ive rambled way too much. Point is theres nothing wrong with immigration just that its undocumented and very difficult to determine who is a poor family tying to make a living and who is a criminal or a moocher coming here to kick up their feet and live off of welfare checks. Both have contributed to the downfall of local economies and the degradation of society in many communities. Its very turbulent and  in some cases  very unprecedented and unpredictable.The way to fix it would be to streamline immigration so that those who want to come to this country to be productive members of society could do so without unnecessary complications to secure the border and prevent illegal immigration of potential criminals or cartel members into the United States andor to promote the economy in Latin America much like the US has done in China over the past  years.EDIT Its ok theres no need to apologize. To be honest I wouldve been confused and set off by a statement like that as well.,Dallas,ciqy8qh,2,t5_2qnkr

Raspberry Pi is the way to go as the power consumption is almost nil compared to that of a computer.  The most expensive part of the system was the VHF multicoupler I had to buy to split the antenna over  scanners.  The antenna was cheap and the rest of the parts are Radio Shack.I got into it because the guy that used to feed KDAL couldnt do it anymore and I could no longer hear what was flying over my house.  I was the perfect candidate because Im only about a mile from KDAL right on the localizer for R.

2200194,0,t1_cljdmo8,I appreciate your response. The same traditions are prevalent in the US especially in the Midwest and the West. I think the culture that comes with the rodeo is an expression of the struggles that came from conquering the frontier in any part of the world. However there are parts of that culture that are required on the job but only succeed in tormenting animals to show those skills in an arena. On the job wrestling a steer to the ground may result in saving the creature from danger but  shows a day for a weekend is just primal stress for entertainment value.    I also like the attitude you express that everyone does have the right to a differing opinion. I wish more people would use words to communicate their differences and not just downvote. That mentality just reduces the quality of input from real people. Im sure many here would like to hear about the charreria you have experience with if you care to share it.

2357551,0,t3_2mc76u,Youll find the Uptown area right near where your work will be to be one of the few even remotely pedestrian friendly areas of the city. I lived over there for  years and found it really enjoyable. Downtown might be another option but as its more business and less residential tons of downtown business close up before the evening. By comparison Uptown has a much livelier night life. The barsclubs on Cedar Springs can be a real hubbub of activity on the weekends. Dont know if thats good or bad for you. I liked that there were places to eat at am but having drunks stumbling down the street outside every Saturday was pretty annoying. That being said Ill be surprised if you can really get by in Dallas without a motorized vehicle of some sort.

The earth has a lot of clay and the weather can be a bit extreme Dallas is actually at threat of just about every natural disaster there is.  The earth shrinks and expands with the varying weather conditions and eventually cracks your foundation.  Not if but when.  The best defense against this is to keep the earth under your foundation moist all the time so it doesnt contract.  Hence Water your foundation.  You can google this as well but basically youre going to use soaker hoses or a sprinkler system to water around the edge of your house to keep the ground underneath it from drying out.,Dallas,cof6gmo,3,t5_2qnkr

3098810,0,t1_coi7w4k,I think it is part of a trend however I would also like to see how the public transit infrastructure stacks up in comparison to Dallas because I would think that needs to be addressed before you take away a commute option.  If you ask me if there was demand for better public transit in Dallas there would be better public transit. But I dont think the demand is there.  The majority of people would rather drive.  And lets face it Dallas isnt those other cities.  They dont match up in suburban sprawl public transit population density and honestly the ingrained attitude of having independence of driving everywhere that Dallas has.  These are all factors to consider so saying such and such city did it isnt good enough for me. As much as the trendy kids in the downtown lofts dont want to admit it Dallas cant just look at this as a Dallas thing.  Dallas is not a city unto itself.  Dallas exists beyond loop   and . Much of the Dallas economy is attached to those who commute from outlying areas all over the metroplex and I think that has to be considered at some level. While the metro area has experienced a population boom Dallas proper hasnt seen much of it.  It isnt because there is a lack of living area or because downtown isnt as walkable as some would like it.  Most of my friends are young late s to mid s professionals who are raising families.  The majority work in Dallas but live in the suburbs where housing and living in general is more reasonable affordable and safer. Thats not even getting into the school system.  Im sure this isnt a hard and fast rule but I dont know anyone that lives in or near downtown that isnt single and wanting to be near the nightlife.  So for the average person who wants to live in a home as opposed to a multi family structure downtown is never going to be an option. I think you are going to find those are the majority of the people who work in all those buildings downtown and surrounding areas.  I wonder how many of them use  as a viable route home?  I also dont see that there would be ANY less traffic to the city core. What I think you will see is that it it just all going to be diverted around Woodall Rogers to  with some going around .  I know the New Dallas folks like to say that bypassing  only adds a few minutes to any commute but lets be honest thats right now.  How much would it add when  no longer exists and EVERY car is taking one of these alternate routes?  Something I havent seen anyone attempt to address is the rate of accelerated deterioration of the alternate routes once  is no longer there to share the traffic load and what the cost impact of that would be.That said I like downtown and if it makes good sense to get rid of  then tear it the fuck down.  But lets do it on good research as opposed to the anecdotal stuff Ive seen thus far not because some real estate guy who stands to make a lot of money says so or because of some hipsters who want to make Dallas more like NYC. Personally before we totally tear down something that already exists I would like to see development where nothing exists. I think more downtown revitalization could be achieved by investing development assets into fast tracking and completing the Trinity River Project.,Dallas,coj6v0x,3,t5_2qnkr

3413815,0,t1_cphe4pl,I think Dallas has done a fantastic job lately.  Sure the city still lacks a lot of pedestrian activity and vibrancy but considering where Dallas was a decade or so ago Id say they are on the right track and are booming.  Just because Collin County has been doing even better in terms of percentage of growth shouldnt really take away from all that Dallas has done in the past several years.  Truth is Collin County and Dallas are both looking great right now.  Hell most of the metroplex is booming.I would like to see more of these big company relocations come to downtown Dallas.  Plano just recently got Toyota and Liberty Mutual pretty much back to back and Richardson has State Farm now.

4069281,0,t1_crk2d11,Kneejerk reaction much? You know absolutely nothing about the situation or why the cop was attempting the arrest. It is obvious that the suspect is resisting arrest as he is forcibly holding himself up to keep from getting his hands pulled behind his back. Realize that if the suspect overpowers him or breaks free he could grab his gun and the officers life could be over. The officer does not know this person or what he is capable of. He does not have the luxury of assuming that the person will act rationally especially if he is already resisting arrest. He has to make a choice in the moment of doing what it takes to subdue this suspect or possibly not going home to his family at the end of the night. Add to this the other group of morons standing around and throwing gas on the situation. If you ever find yourself in a situation where you need assistance this very officer may be the one that comes to put his life on the line to protect your person or property. Show a little damn respect and at least give him the benefit of the doubt before you have all the facts in hand.,Dallas,crk4jsl,6,t5_2qnkr

4207472,0,t1_crztlvt,In the video those officers clearly tell that group of girls and assorted other young men to disperse. And they just dont seem to abide. As for the strawman theory I replied to the most comprehensive account of all occurrences after checking into some background of this story. To start on many other smaller sites blogs community church groups Ive read many of the same intimate details from residents or bystanders. A lot of people are wary of putting anything factual on social media for fear of backlash or being labeled racist. This is a real concern for people very close to this situation esp bc the older lady used slurs in the video and it has made everyone in that community look bad. I am originally from Tyler TX not too far from this Dallas suburb and have much family still in and around Dallas. I have a fairly far removed relative that lives in this community through marriage of a second cousin. So I dont want to say I have first hand knowledge of what went down but multiple accounts from people much closer to the source all say many of the same things. Much of it has not been posted on public forumsnews which is why I have not put that info on the internet. I feel it is their place to do so not mine as I wasnt there to witness but I also feel like this is being grossly misrepresented in the media which is why I have spoke up to some degree.,Dallas,crzu8y4,2,t5_2qnkr

No they are far more concerned with their agenda than with making money dinosaur media doing badly as a result and they dont seem to care  further indicating their agenda isnt moneygt Why are they doing this?Mostly racial demographics and getting more power for the federal governmentgt What do they have to gain by spending billions of dollars to transport refugees into the country?Political power.gt How is this relavent to Jade helm?It was relevant to foreigners being brought here largely unnoticed with the original focus on foreign troops.  It isnt hard to bring them in unnoticed when the media wont report it.gt Whats the goal?Turning the US in to a rd world country.  Globalists want worldwide serfdom.  Cant have that while the US has such a higher standard of living.  You really cant see this going on?   Outsourcing jobs importing foreign labor in addition to the illegal aliens AND the refugees....gt Why spend so much money to ruin the economy? Your money.  Why would they care?

5367588,0,t1_cvxq1bo,I would like to see DART DCTA and The T do what the Seattlearea transit system has done push to get a regional transit operator that runs the longhaul routes to connect systems and essentially run freeway routes.  Thats what Sound Transit does in the topleft corner of the lower .  Local transit agencieslike Metro Pierce and Community Transitrun routes inside their service areas.  Sound Transit operates intercity routes like routes between Everett north of Seattle into downtown Seattle where people can then transfer to local service.  ST is its own taxing entity so it has its own income but I could see the three north Texas agencies pitching in to fund a regional transit provider.  Sound Transit doesnt run its own buses it contracts with the local providers to run longhaul routes but ST has its own board that is tasked solely with regionwide service so it sets the routes and then contracts them out.Pieinthesky ideas with absolutely no grounding in cost or feasibility Ive had for routes that could be run under a system Southlake to Garland on  and  Denton to Fort Worth on W Lewisville to McKinney via Carrollton and Plano on E PGBT US  Fort Worth to Addison via HEB and Irving on  PGBT DNT North TRE North Richland Hills to downtown Dallas on  South TRE Downtown Fort Worth to downtown Dallas via south Arlington on  and The biggest consideration to doing this is twofold There has to be a way for a bus to easily get on and off the freeway and there has to be local transit connections and passenger waiting areas wherever the route route stops.  Sound Transit and Metro does this by use of what are known as flyer stops essentially busonly exits with a bus stop where local routes can connect.  Also these kinds of routes should use the HOVHOT lanes or even the shoulders wherever possible to keep them out of general traffic otherwise theyll be so timepenalized that few will use them.,Dallas,cvxrq66,5,t5_2qnkr

They really do have a bit of a complex. I have spent more than a decade living in each place and speak from experience. They have cheesy sayings like Dallas is where the east peters out and Fort Worth is where the west begins. Yes they actually say this and they are really cheesy about the cowboy culture.Agreed.

Youre giving them what they need to trade for drugs and alcohol while perpetuating the cycle of staying homeless. Its a feel good that hurts what some of us do in our community and it needs to stop.

7182722,0,t3_4dscaj,First of all welcome! Dallas is amazing.    Secondly I moved here from the Northeast in . I love it here and while I enjoy visiting family and friends back in the Northeast I dont plan on leaving here anytime soon. I mean just look at that gorgeous skyline in the header image!    So what to expect....    Weather   As others have said its very hot. It can get cold but nothing like the Northeast. Really the coldest it gets is comparable to October or November in the Northeast in that it can get cold enough for ice and even some snow but its really rare  probably like the inverse in the Northeast in terms of rarity of degree or higher days in the summer. Some years it wont even happen at all.  By May people speak of not going to Rangers games because its already too hot to sit out there in the open stadium for several hours. The high heat keeps up until late Fall or at least it did last year my first full year here.  Also pools here are also different. You know how in the Northeast its amazing to find someone with a heated pool? Well here they dont do that shit. Rather you can find chilled pools. That is because the pools temperature is usually very warm. I dont mind it but its a different feeling.  Get used to seeing people dressed in possibly heavy layers when its in the s and low s. I laughed inside at first now Im one of them. In fact even in the summer I bring my zipup hoodie with me places like work because indoor locations usually have the air conditioner on full blast.      It doesnt rain too often but when it does it seems to be torrential. Showers are rare. Also tornadoes are rare but youll hear severe weather alerts on the radio and possibly a tornado siren every now and then. We had some bad last December around Christmas. But hey no blizzards!    Driving  The driving here is very different from the Northeast. People are a lot less aggressive. I moved here from MA and massholes do not typically exist by comparison.  One big change for me can be described best by telling you the situation. I was coming out of a parking lot and trying to make a left on a lane road. A car was coming towards me to my left. Now in MA how thats handled is I wait for the car to go past me in fact it usually and expectedly would speed up once it saw my blinker as to allow me to make my left turn once they passed. Well in my situation I wondered why the driver was taking so long. As Ive come to learn its the inverse here the driver slows down when they see you to let you in. Yes people actually let you in to traffic here! Lane changes are the same where drivers will slow down to allow you in front of them rather than speed the hell up for you to merge after them. Its beautiful and I love it.  The highway system is here is also something to behold. It is massive and I never feel like I did back in MA where if I missed an exit I was screwed and itd take  minutes to get back on track. Here its easy. A lot of places even have side roads running parallel right next to the highway.    People  As touched on in the last section people here are far more friendly as well. Back in MA if you tried talking to a stranger you might get weird looks and be assumed to be a crazy. Here expect it and learn to embrace it. I once went to pick up some fast food and went in at the same time as someone else that had just arrived. They placed an order and spent the whole time waiting for the food just chatting about their day with the cashier who was involved in the conversation as well ie not just ugh stfu stranger.  Despite stereotypes I have not encountered racism. Ive yet to see a single Confederate flag ironically I saw one in MA on a holiday trip! cowboy hats happen but not in huge numbers and Ive yet to see anyone carrying a gun.    Food  Everyone asks me if BBQ is good here. Damn right it is. I go to Dickeys every Thursday for their lunch special and thats just one option. Theres also a shitload of chicken places for some reason. You have KFC Chick Fil A Chicken Express Henderson Chicken Golden Chick Popeyes Churchs Chicken... Im sure Im forgetting some. Theres also a very Texas fast food joint called Whataburger that you will hear plenty of. For some reason they pronounce the first syllable of it as watt and not what which has never made sense to me since its name literally looks like what a burger! Oh well.  Theres plenty of Mexican and TexMex options as well. Basically you will not be without myriad options for your diet.    Home Living  First of all there is no income tax. Hooray! However that means property taxes are usually higher than in the Northeast. Boo! Its a tradeoff.    Also renting usually costs more than buying a house outright and paying a monthly mortgage. Theres lots of places to rent and the monthly rent can get pretty high from what we saw when we moved here.  Another thing to know is that where I came from there was generally bad parts of town in specific areas you just knew not to go to. Here you could be driving down a street with homes way out of your league then make a left and see houses you wouldnt even consider. Then make another turn and see more great homes. Its very varied like that for some reason.    Finally its important to understand bugspests. They generally dont happen in the Northeast they do and will happen here. I had lived in Florida before the Northeast for college and I have Katsaridaphobia phobia of cockroaches. I dont just mean oh gross I mean a paralyzing fear where if I saw one Id go spend the night elsewhere even after killing it. So when we moved here and saw a couple after moving in at first we just thought it was a case of old tenantsnew tenants and would go away. NOPE. Soon enough we signed a contract with Terminex to come out quarterly and spray. And even then they still make appearances just randomly the worst and usually already dead or dying. Thats definitely something that doesnt happen in the Northeast so I felt it important to mention to you!  In closing its fantastic and Id also like to stress that all of the above has been my own personal experience since moving here. Your results my vary naturally. But my wife and I love it and hope to have a house here by the end of the month!,Dallas,d1um2cp,2,t5_2qnkr

But maybe I just dont drive through the really bad parts because this looks like some kind of work truck which likely means youre on the road a lot.  And this is pretty damning evidence right here.But good on you for sticking your own fuck up in there too and not putting yourself above everyone else.  At first I thought you were saying fucker like it was the fault of the guy in front of you but then I realized you were probably just cussing.  And yeah I would have to say driving in the rain is the worst around here.  Ive come to notice that people here just get oddly irrational the second water starts to drop its such a bizarre phenomenon.,Dallas,d1wpcng,2,t5_2qnkr
7203879,0,t3_4e2ah7,As someone who came from the Chicago land area a little over  years ago the drivers in Dallas are horrible for a few reasons. A majority of the people are massively inconsiderate if you look at this video you see idiots pull in front of someone then slow down and turn yet if the just waited and went behind the care the could easily make the turn with out impacting someone else. I see this kind of stupid knuckleheaded behavior all the time. Instead of waiting for me to go by so someone could turn the idiots come out in front of me and try to make the turn as fast as they can yet behind me is wide open space so they can easily get it done. Dallas drivers I have found are massively inconsiderate and just dont use their head. People are playing with their phone way to much  I have noticed over the last few years people have become either way to engrossed into their phone call or into playing around with facebook or anything else and not paying attention.. People just dont pay attention I have never seen such a lack of understanding of how the damn road works. In the Texas Rules of the Road it specifically states that the left lane is for passing. A huge portion of the DFW metro area have no idea how to fucking drive properly. They sit in the left lane slowing everyone down because they dont realize that they are either going the same speed as the car next to them or they need to get over because they are slowing everyone down. GET OVER you idiots. Those are the big reasons to why DFW drivers suck so bad. Chicago was nice because the people might of sucked but everyone drove like a bat out of hell. Here people sit in the left lane barely going the speed limit holding everyone up and dont give a shit. Its completely ridiculous and that mindset needs to drastically change. Also cities need to be better at how they plan and coordinate their green lights. They should easily extend the north south greenlights by at least another  seconds and they should increase the speed limit up to mph in a lot of areas. This would speed up traffic and help reduce congestion. ,Dallas,d1x0uyh,5,t5_2qnkr

7424988,0,t3_4gzpix,My experience was very frustrating I was given a  ticket for rolling a stop sign.  I had not received my official ticket  summons via mail by the time of my court date that was written on the paper ticket the police officer gave me at the time of citation.  I called multiple times to see what was going on and the court always said wait weve pushed your court date back.  I started recieving mail from multiple two bit law offices offering to fight my case in court before i even got my official ticket from the city.  Once i finally got my ticket I called again and they said if I came in that day and paid the fine in full in person they would expunge the charge from my record which I did.  Basically there seemed to be no rhyme reason or structure on what was going on or what to do and the communication was terrible.  I know this was a rambling statement that didnt really answer your question.  I would just go to the court and take care of it in person if I were you. ,Dallas,d2m68he,4,t5_2qnkr

7896930,0,t3_4netot,I think it is telling that the statistics cited simply point out either known issues or serve to specifically point the finger at the Superintendent they forced out by essentially saying it is the fault of principals brought in under his tenure when those principals were brought in largely to deal with the fact the Board has been more concerned with politics than education and has been protecting staffers based on popularityconnections rather than capability.Saying training is necessary is a copout. Of course training is necessary. Thats a huge issue in education and to be blunt districts like DISD end up with a lot of the least capable teachers because the best have other options. They get some who are truly dedicated and want to go where there is the most need but even those teachers do not receive the support and resources they need to do their job well.If a kid is getting suspended frequently at that age either the teacher cannot manage the classroom or the parentsguardians have not done their job. So that means you have to figure out who is responsible and address that. For teachers it may mean training. It may mean they need reassigned. It may mean they are terminated.For parents it may mean they need resources to help. It may mean they need the authorities involved. It may mean that the school needs to have programsclasses for those kids so they can receive an education and learn how to behave.But while I love to blame school administrators usually the principal has few options. They can typically either send the kid back to class or suspend them. This isnt a movie and the kid isnt going to be taught American History X one on one. So while some principals do need to acknowledge they have to be more directly involved the reality is they also have to have tools to do so. And the Board doesnt allocate resources for that.As long as the Board is overstaffing the district administration keeping unqualified staff on the payroll meaning they stay longer and have higher salaries and undermines any effort to address problem schools because those schools happen to be predominantly black and they have administrators and teachers who are unfit for the job but protected by the Board nothing is going to get better.,Dallas,d43osb1,2,t5_2qnkr

7909432,0,t1_d449mky,This couldnt have been said better or from someone more qualified.  Its the problem we have with trust in our police today.  It wasnt ALWAYS like this and the police today even have more nonlethal tools at their disposal than in years past yet the numbers of police shootings and obsessive force cases rise by the day.Either the training is obviously flawed or the people being hired to be police are the wrong people to begin with.  Maybe we need to bring in European police or at least study how they do it over there without all the unnecessary death.  We like to think were the beacon of right of the world but when their society is just as fine as ours and they dont have the excessive police deaths something can be obviously improved upon for the good of us all.  You can try to blame guns but I dont believe guns are the problem especially when in a whole bunch of these cases the only gun involved was the one wielded by the law enforcement officer.  Those are pretty cut and dry murder cases to me in my eyes.  Thats the exact problem many countries see in arming every patrol officer.  They just want to blame it on more cameras more eyes more scrutiny.  But thats a chicken and egg argument to begin with because if you didnt have such a dramatic rise in officer involved shootings and obsessive force cases they wouldnt have the extra scrutiny that they have today.,Dallas,d453fit,1,t5_2qnkr

7955625,0,t3_4o784x,The whole thing is a waste. The original plan called for an ecofriendly golf course. I.E. native grasses and plants recycled water and limits on water features animal highways and greens buffered by natural and cultivated extensions of the surrounding preserve. Now the whole thing is fenced off to protect it from wild hogs and looks like any other runofthemill golf course. The city could have turned the landfill into a Katy Prairie style conservancy to complement the surrounding greenspace. Instead they opted for a oneoff commercial sports facility. Which is a shame given that the city will have to learn how to manage the other capped illegal landfill filling out the Lower Chain of Wetlands and the McCommas Bluff landfill which is closing in on its lifespan. The Observer and DMN need to turn their attention to the roadways servicing that golf course. How much of the surrounding preserves and neighborhoods will be sacrificed to ensure roadway construction sufficient to service Byron Nelson traffic? ,Dallas,d4aacbg,6,t5_2qnkr

7981086,0,t1_d4d48yp,First of all Im pretty sure the people in your posted photo are just making a joke. Nobody really thinks that America should be turned into Mexico. Even young dumbass white college students. They are stupid but not that stupid. As a joke its pretty funny. Second Im personally a shitlord myself Ill make racist jokes or tell a stranger that they are fucking retarded or their mom is fat only on the internet though of course. But I also think Trump is a little over the top. Maybe thats not entirely a bad thing but you dont have to be an SJW to see that some of the shit he has said has been a little extreme for someone who is supposed to be running for president. Things that will certainly push away potential republicans away from the Republican Party. So when you see people yelling at trump supporters or calling them racist its usually some sort of built up anger at something usually the Man or the system or whatever. Now that being said I believe in freedom of speech above all else. I think that you should be free to say anything you like just like Trump should be able to. Just remember that some people dont agree with everything and that doesnt necessarily make them a liberal or an SJW. I dont agree that Mexico sends us their criminals and rapists or whatever the quote is from him but I dont think that people should lose their shit over it either. Its just words. Idk where I was going with this but I wanted you to know that not everyone is an SJW if they arent a republican. Im pretty neutral on the spectrum myself so I cant really take a side but I can also see the concerns with both sides. ,Dallas,d4d5dsu,3,t5_2qnkr

8211805,0,t1_d540mn2,I think it should be mentioned Im not trying to really place blame on the police or accuse them or anything. Just sharing frustration for the brothers.Im not a fan of BLM as they mostly seem to harm relationships. Corey Hughes seems like a guy that cares for his community and also cares for the police so it feels a bit unfair that with all the respect he has for them and the care he showed to make sure the situation with his brother was handled correctly that it was handled poorly even after his brother surrendered himself and his firearm. Then to hear that he himself was accused of wanting to hurt police is even more disappointing. But at the same time I can understand where the police were coming from especially given the BLM reputation and of course the actions tonight. As mentioned its mostly me venting frustration as well as being up now for  straight hours.I did like hearing that at least Corey the organizer not the person of interest doesnt plan on leaving Dallas or anything like that. His issue is mostly that he was treated as an accomplice despite helping and I hope that something is done so that he feels vindicated because as I mentioned he has a positive voice and is more about what these protests should be about not stuff like violence looting or blocking highways.,Dallas,d5413ul,1,t5_2qnkr

Evicting them halfway through the lease will cost  months worth of rent and that stolenbroken appliances cost the same for a mo unit as a mo unit.  Not defending slumlords but shitty destructive deadbeat tenants are a HUGE part of the reason housing for the poor is more expensive than it needs to be and you get them far more often the cheaper the rent is because they KNOW they are judgmentproof so the landlord has zero recourse.  ,Dallas,d7mt2z6,-1,t5_2qnkr

Since my mom didnt qualify we ended up going with a lower cost facility down in Stephenville. Hang in there  not an easy process but there are some resources out there that can help.

But then you spread the virus around and someone else gets it and has a horrible time.The vaccine helps prevent you from spreading the flu around. Even if you are healthy and would easily fight it off anyway youre still slightly contagious for a time.  This is how the flu spreads so widely people with only minor symptoms dont know they have it and keep about their daily lives. The vaccine helps prevent this not  but it helps some. WHEN you get the shot the flu you prevent may not be your own.

10548856,0,t1_dd3kct2,It says that the daughter in an monthold US citizen. It is implying that she was born in America which I believe by law makes her a citizen. Also the mother is in the process of if not already becoming a US permanent residentcitizen otherwise she would have to return to her home country with her daughter. And if youll notice I said American not American citizen. We should not mistreat Americans regardless if they have just been here for a few months or for their entire lifetimes. Yes the mother needs to become a permanent residentcitizen if she is not already if she is to raise her daughter in America but I see no indication of her refusing to become an American citizen or identify as American. She has done no wrong. By contrast Trump has done wrong through intimidation and by treating our guests and citizenstobe in a dehumanizing way. If it was his wife held at the airport before she became a citizen she didnt become a citizen until  he might be able to see wrong.And maybe its a fantasy idea but its the exact same idea that Winthrop had when he gave his City on a Hill sermon and thats the exact same idea that the Founding Fathers had in mind. Theres not an idea out there that is more American.I am a son of an immigrant. That daughter and her mother are just as American as I am and as my father is.

Most of their student body are nontraditional students that for financial or other reasons cant go to SMU or a school in another city.That said I am confident that they will be accredited and their graduates will be able to take the bar and get licensed.  They have a good faculty and the connections and will to do what they need to to get accredited.While they are doing everything they can to prepared their students for the bar exam the high likelihood is that theyll have a poor passing rate  and that is largely a function of the students theyre admitting not the curriculum.  UNTDCL is now what DFW School of Law was back in the s  unaccredited and trying their best to get footing and respect.  But DFW made it in the end  they became Texas Wesleyan continued to improve and were eventually bought by TAMU.  Theyre a solid but not top school now.

I hope the GOP doesnt go away either debate is good.  I just want them to stop going further and further to the extreme right.  I want them to stop denying basic science like climate change and leave LGBT people alone.  We can debate how to get businesses to come or how to fight climate change but holy shit am I sick of them denying science and butting into the bedroom.Especially in Dallas what exactly do you expect? . of Dallas County went for Clinton just . for Trump   Cities with more diversity and higher overall levels of education tend to be liberal. The youth are increasingly liberal. If you dont like liberal policies its gonna suck for you in a decade or two. Well improve this country over the protests of the baby boomers refusing to budge on anything. And you seem really fucking salty over the mere existence of liberals so youll probably hate it with an ever greater passion. Edit Oh and for the record most Americans want a path to citizenship  for undocumented people.

If you are OK with suburbs the further north you go the cheaper it is by the square foot.  Apartments in Dallas particularly in uptown or anywhere close are very expensive.  Condostownhomes in the best areas of the city are not cheap either.  I just sold a townhome in the Oak Lawn area and got close to sf and it was close to a busy road and needed a few updates.  I am sure it is cheaper than DC but definitely NOT cheap.  Traffic around rush hour is miserable and getting worse all the time.  Too many people moving here.  People here are probably friendlier than where you live but its still difficult to make friends IMO unless you have an activity of some kind where it becomes easier.  If you are religious then joining a church you could quickly make some social inroads.  If not then try some reddit meetups or meetup.com.Crime is not a major issue if you live in a nice area.  Best advice I could give you is if you are considering moving here DONT BUY A HOUSE UNTIL YOU SPEND SOME TIME IN THE AREA!  Hate to be all caps guy but the area is vast and your experience here will vary widely depending on whether or not you are in a far north suburb or in the busiest areas of the city itself which can be walkable to a decent amount of things and getting better all the time.
