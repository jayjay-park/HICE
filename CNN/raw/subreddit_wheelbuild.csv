567717,0,t1_cg2va3y,I checked with our master wheelbuilder today and he said he usually works off a  ERD. Im wondering if there is sometimes a slight ridge at the spoke hole from the drilling process that would account for the discrepancy. ,wheelbuild,cg4sz9f,1,t5_2sue9

1361456,0,t3_29odzz,Being a clyde I would suggest you go to a wider rim. The Open Pro is an okay rim but its a  year old design. If you go wider youll enjoy better ride comfort handling and less chance of a pinch flat. We Velocity have the A which of course would be my first choice but there are other good options out there as well. The Shimano hubs are a good call for a clyde. They arent light but they hold up very well. Your spoke choice will do fine though I wouldnt shy away from double butted spokes if you can afford it. Theyll be a little lighter and are stronger than plain gauge.,wheelbuild,cimy5ad,5,t5_2sue9

2420964,0,t1_cmaxmvj,You think they built those wheels with dt comp? Its been a while since I built one of those bikes up. But youve got a good point in that even if theyre not exactly dt comp theyre probably a very similar stainless straight gauge spoke.

2497448,0,t3_2o7t8n,You dont need to look up the dimensions of the hub. You can just measure it yourself. Go to a place like Harbor Freight and buy a cheap dial caliper that measures to .mm increments. Thats close enough. If you cant get your mitts on the hub try emailing the manufacturer of you cant find specs online. To measure the hub measure the flange diameter or rather the diameter of the spoke hole circle the diameter of the holes themselves is generally not needed . Measure the distance between the flanges. Eventually youll need to know the distance from the middle of the hub to the flange. There are lots of ways to do it. You can figure out a method that works for you. The distance to both sides will be the same on the front and on SS or other symmetric rear wheels but multispeed hubs will usually have two different distances. As long as youre accurate within a mm or so you should be fine. The rim dimensions you need might be right on the rim labelyou need the ERD Effective Rim Diameter. Its tricky to measure so its worth Googling around for a while if it comes down to that. Again you can figure out a method that works for you. Once you have all that info its time to hit the spoke calculator. There are lots of free utilities available online. Google will give you several options. I like the one I found on Sheldon Browns website produced by Damon Rinard it contains an pretty extensive db of hub and rim dimensions though I dont know how much current stuff is on there. It runs in Excel. Others are native Web applications. Once youve done all that and crunched the numbers youll have your answer. If the numbers are within mm or so you shouldnt have too much trouble putting those salvaged spokes back in service. That said if the spokes arent anything special it might be worth the extra bucks to pony up for some DT or Wheelsmith spokes. Personally Im a DT guy. The mark on the head will tell you who made the spoke. Edit to add When youre crunching the numbers input slight variations of any single dimension  for example add mm to the centertoflange distance  to see how the spoke length is affected. Remember measure carefully and double check for accuracy. Also you can save yourself a lot of measuring and calculating by simply measuring the spokes youve already got. ,wheelbuild,cmkjzc7,2,t5_2sue9

3742672,0,t3_338jbn,If those really are the rims and that really is the spokes poking up into the rim tape then thats a major problem. However they wouldnt cause pinch flats those are caused by improper installation or insufficient tire pressure. If most of the spokes are poking into the rim tape then that means theyre far too long especially since the Mavic Opens are double walled rims. Normally having spokes that are mm long on DW rims arent an issue because theyre separated from the tire bed but if theyre that far up there then youve got a problem. Another interesting thing about this is most spokes wouldnt have enough threads for this to be an issue. Unless someone cut a bunch more threads on a bunch of spokes that were too long. Without seeing the wheels its hard for me to judge. If you have some pictures that would probably help.,wheelbuild,cqiw0yk,2,t5_2sue9
4093875,0,t1_crmx4u7,Sounds good. Im  just over lbs so I think I will stick to the straight spokes for now. Maybe think about changing in the future after some weight is off. I appreciate the input thanks. ,wheelbuild,crmxdwy,1,t5_2sue9

4935878,0,t1_cufu9po,Not for the rear wheel.  For the rear wheel you want as close to tangential as you can manage since there is torsional force of the hub relative to the rim.  You can do it on the front as long as there are no disc brakes but many hubs are safety hazards when radially laced in high spoke counts as radial puts the highest stress on the flanges and high spoke counts reduce the amount of material between holes in the flange.  It is usually safe if using a forged hub body but not for CNCed.  You also then have to get multiple spoke lengths.  There is very little advantage in radial aside from a few grams weight difference and a slightly better bracing angle for headsin.I would highly advise reading this text.,wheelbuild,cugpgen,2,t5_2sue9

9043754,0,t1_d7yb6c3,We use purple loctite but Ive used blue at times for my own builds. Either way it shouldnt get to a point where it winds up the spoke in fact it makes them easier to true down the line since gritcorrosion cant get in there. Both blue and purple are very low bonding. My guess is its something other than loctite. I personally hate Spoke Prep and feel like Ive had more windup issues with that stuff than I ever did with loctite. ,wheelbuild,d7ywxh1,1,t5_2sue9
9155188,0,t3_55myot,Its convention to use more spokes on a track wheel. Generally track racers are more powerful so more spokes helps to handle the higher torque.

10012698,0,t1_dbcny7m, Im reading from here A frequent reason for body transplantation is to convert a  or speed Freehub to use an speed cassette. This generally will increase the overlocknut dimension. As a result you will usually need to redish the wheel after doing this upgrade.

10102565,0,t3_5jrr4q,I find the ND to be more useful for disassembly honestly. For zipping up  a wheel I prefer the Problem Solver Holy Driver and a cordless drill. The pin depth is adjustable. Theres typically some evening out that needs to happen since no rim is perfectly uniform and cut spokes are all slightly different but generally it zips the wheel up relatively straight. ,wheelbuild,dbodknb,2,t5_2sue9
