5361534,0,t3_3ogcxw,Im not against illegal poke ball combinations but since I play Pokmon competitively I personally dont breed for or trade for them I accidentally traded for one once. After an incident last nationals Ray Rizzo  multiple time VGC champion using a dream ball aegislash they officially released rules on the ds Pokmon website that if you are caught using hacked pokemon...even if its just a ball...you can get banned from online rating battlescompetitions.Heres the link if youre interestedI dont mind them and I find it completely silly we havent had a legal way to get eevee in apricorn balls along with some other combinations I like but knowing how forgetfull I am its safer for me to just avoid them. If I werent aiming for nationals and competing officially online I would totally  collect them though.Edit I find it interesting that some people on smogon are so antihacking but a majority of people play smogon format and not VGC doubles.,BankBallExchange,cvwzw0e,1,t5_3245y
