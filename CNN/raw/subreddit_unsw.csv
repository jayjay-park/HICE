4025090,0,t3_36gle7,Nah I doubt the peanuts thing will not be okay with most people. Some people just wont get it but for others it might seem fine. Also it is a reaaaallllllyy bad idea to drop that kind of thing on your roommates when you first meet them  who knows maybe they love peanuts or something and you have just come in and ruined there favourite food. The best option is to email the village and see what they say about people with allergies etc.In the village you share a kitchen with your housemates but in the colleges I think you have communal kitchens which everybody uses... Not to sure though. You will meet heaps of people if you live on campus and in all likelihood get shitfaced a lot in your first year. Sometimes you get unlucky with roommates. If you dislike the majority of your roommates then you are probably the weird one and vice versa.Campus life is heaps of fun though. Its a great experience.,unsw,crf38zt,3,t5_2rg56

7362836,0,t3_4frhhv,Hey I did the UPP course in . Basically its just a preparation course into uni. You will. Learn how to properly research using the UNSW library facilities. And how to research things IN DEPTH. Learn how to write an academic essay and therefore how to properly reference using the UNSW guidelines we use a variation on the Harvard Referencing system. Youll also get the chance to enroll in a subject of your choosing alongside undergraduate students of the university. That way you become familiar with the lecturetutorial setting. This subject is determined by the particular path you choose within UPP math science or social if i remember correctlyIn saying all of that there is nothing to do but to dive head first into it. If Dom is still the head of it all Id just shoot him a message and ask for assistance  ...This was the best thing I ever did it put that foot in the door and now I am half way through my Social Work degree and psychology Mate seriously stick with it because it gets tedious at times but just remember end goal. ,unsw,d2f3rbc,1,t5_2rg56

I would recommend Comp Sci to most people as its a year shorter and if you still want to do honours you can. Info Sys Run by the business more geared to business analyst type roles. its a easier course lot less workload etcAlso i guess at your current age you will save yourself a year which is a big bonus i m going to guess.,unsw,d93mpb6,4,t5_2rg56
