2697851,0,t3_2qxebh, She is pretty new and is currently in the top  for the month. She looks super young and is really skinny.  Girls absolutely hate other girls who are younger or look younger and are skinnier especially if they are competing against them.,myfreecams,cnaq7op,-3,t5_2sai9
3142908,0,t1_codm5yg,LilSecrett was FIRED only after the media mentioned her along with Babyyyydoll OSU student.  That came out on Channel  out of Oregon where OSU is located.  I know if this was my children and the way she spoke to them condescendingly I would be furious.  Those parents deserve to know their children are being exploited during a sexual act in a public place. Least we forget the videos are still being sold worldwide.  I wonder how many pedos are watching those kids as she masturbates and fingers her Twat.  And also if this were a guy doing this in public what would the ramifications be? Im sure he would be hung to dry no pun intended.  Anyone defending Kat aka Pumpkin aka Noodle is a obvious supporter of underage play in public chat.  What you do in private or true private or in your bedroom is YOUR business.  But when it comes to the public forum its PUBLIC and everyones business and responsibility to report it.  Katsumi from the beginning harassed and bullied models which I personally witnessed. So anyone who is saying JUJU is bullying youre spinning the story to fit your own warped ethical standards.,myfreecams,conrcuf,-3,t5_2sai9
3716729,0,t3_32pdoe,The majority of people making caps or sharing a models premium videos are only motivated by money. Their motivation has little to do specifically with a model other than maybe her popularity. They upload the caps or your premium videos to file lockers and put up a paywall so you have to sign up for premium to download the file and they get a cut from the site for the signups. From there you have other people that have premium access download the file then reupload to another file locker without the paywall on their own account so they can generate a smaller revenue from the file being downloaded and the ads you have to click through to get to the download link in the first place. Again it trickles down to other people that will download those free videos and upload to streaming sites with point systems that reward you for views. Theres also people that cap and share videos for free in private communities but theyre a minority in the origin of these videos.The original group the ones motivated by money have systems dedicated solely to record models. These systems are mostly automated and are recording  models at any given time. They dont care about property of captions DMCA or copyright images or any other nonsense models plaster all over their screen or videos because the cappers never even see this stuff. They also dont care if those images get their videos removed because theyll just reupload. All that stuff on the screen when overly used is only effecting negatively the experience of the models real viewers and fans. If you must add those things keep them simple. Dont write out twittermodelname or property of modelname on a grey bar that goes across the screen. Just keep it simple like modelname in the corner.Someone I used to game with became a model and her answer to cappers was to let them be. Instead she focused on making high quality videos which is where she was generating the majority of the revenue. The only thing she did make a change to was adding her twitter handle on her screen and videos which was also her model name so that when she did get capped or shared the people watching knew where to find her and potentially become new tippers. Something she noticed was that when she first started making videos in SD they would sometimes pop up on streaming sites. When she started making them in HD she never saw them shared. She assumed that the jump from  MB files to  MB files discouraged the sharing for whatever reason.,myfreecams,cqfxmal,2,t5_2sai9

6170513,0,t3_3ugahw,ABC News article on her and her cop husband. This is why she got out of the business. Her twitter account shut down too the only thing I think that might still be active is her Instagram account I dont know because I dont use Instagram.  She was a lot of fun to watch I remember when she ordered a pizza and paid for it nude.,myfreecams,cyr0uqm,1,t5_2sai9

The ones that decide to go balls deep to win are the only ones who are disappointed. As long as the raffle details are clear that this date is not romantic and just a fun opportunity there should be no issue.,myfreecams,db7cexh,6,t5_2sai9
