9628915,0,t1_d9zu4i2,Yeah I probably shouldnt have commented without listening with better speakers. It seems obviously programmed on my phone decent speaker but still a phone but with the other comment thinking its a sample too Im probably just not hearing it come through. ,Samplehunters,d9zymnx,1,t5_2shkm
10939640,0,t3_5w9f97,Yeah I was looking for the same. If its any conciliation I think the Zero G stuff was ripped from other sample CDs anyway so you might be able to build it up manually.. but I also havent been able to find any decent track listings!,Samplehunters,de8ci5q,1,t5_2shkm
