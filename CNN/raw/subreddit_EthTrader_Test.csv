Ive got it at the moment so that its static by default then when you hover it triggers the animation. That way we can get the important information on screen by default then to show more information and to get the sexy scrolling effect you can mouseover.Im not sure what you mean by swap them do you mean like a slideshow type effect? This is possible but it might end up increasing the size of the image that has to be downloaded each time we update the info. Id need to do a bit more dev work to test this out  not much time  Im going to be a dad for the first time next month!,EthTrader_Test,d1mtfqu,1,t5_3cm0r
