306685,0,t3_1xkg7b,From my limited experience with dogs I dont think he is ill. Just from the places he peed on. If they couldnt hold their bladder our dogs peed just just before the garden door or in some corner as far away as possible from the good places. Couch and bed are obviously good places but they are also your places.So I would say it may be some sort of protest to choose these two places to pee. Is he allowed on the couch and in the bed? Also  hours alone without peeing are verry long for a dog. You can try to give him less water but that will make his time alone more miserable.,cockerspaniel,cfck0ec,1,t5_2sh4v

2485235,0,t1_cmixqsd,gt The popularity if merle isnt going away anytime soon.Dogs are not fucking fashion accessories! You keep talking about color as if its inconsequential. Color is a big deal. Korthals Pointing Griffons are actually considering making tan points in their breed a disqualification because they think there are health issues tied to the gene that causes tan points. Thats it two tan points on the eyebrows can cause health issues. refer to uMockingbirdRamblers comment below.You are acting like color is inconsequential when its the opposite. ,cockerspaniel,cmiyinx,3,t5_2sh4v

8905303,0,t1_d7i2onw,Thanks theyre slowly getting used to it. Biggest change is that theyve never lived in an apartment before. Getting info used to the random noises and the elevator will take some time but I took a couple days off work to stay home and help with the adjustment. Making sure to explore the building with them with a steady supply of treats in an effort to help familiarize them. ,cockerspaniel,d7iaeaf,1,t5_2sh4v
