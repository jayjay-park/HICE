5238930,0,t3_3mrk8u,Characters and World BuildingRumorsA Rumor is a transdimensional being which builds the barriers between Legends and Ordinaries occupying same Realm. The Rumors work by stopping time to get rid of all of the evidence of these beings and build partitions around them to conceal their existence. Other galaxies and planets and dimensions have their own Legends and Ordinaries. So Rumors live in all corners of the MultiVerse working tirelessly to keep the friction to a minimum.Rumors breed by touching common objects with their left hand. They cannot reproduce until they have gone through the change of life. When they can breed they pick up a common object hold it and then put it down. It becomes a seed. A lot of seeds are produced by breeder Rumors. Typically a breeder Rumor will open a shop selling trinkets and jewelry. They will convert all the wares in their shop to seeds unbeknownst to the buyers by touching the items with their bare left hand.The person who owns it when they die or it becomes lost the seed becomes a person. Usually they wear gloves to prevent this happening in a way that is not appropriate such as turning another person into a seed. The newly formed Rumor will take the form of a child and appear in an orphanage. The people at the orphanage will not notice a new person and wonder where they came from because when the orphan looks the caretaker in the eye the eye contact creates a fabricated history as if the orphan had been there many years. This fabricated history is an extension of the Rumor. The seed that turns into a Rumor will always be some sort of accessory such as a watch a ring. When the Rumor spawns it will be wearing the object never takes it off and it changes size to stay with the Rumor.They do not always take the form of an orphan. Sometimes they take the place of someone who died. This is more difficult and is only done by experienced Rumors. They do this when someone has exposed them for what they are and their identity is compromised. So they take the form of someone who died within the last  hours. They basically freeze time and step into that person while that persons energy is freed to the universe. Once inside the person they are able to recall all memories and emotions. That is how they are able to seamlessly assume the new identity. So for example in a case where a person should have died in a terrible head on collision and people say it is a miracle the person lived that would be a Rumor stepping into a new body. Sometimes the Rumor is so exposed in one realm they have to flee to another dimension. Because Rumors can stop time and teleport from point to point in spacetime they can be in another point in spacetime in a fraction of a nanosecond. This is handy for them when they need to find a new location. As they leave a place their niche in that world their identity dissolves into nothing. There is no record of a missing person. They are just gone and no one remembers them.The only way to kill a Rumor is to first kill the seed. This can be tricky since Rumors tend to wear lots of jewelry and accessories. They do this to camouflage their seed so their enemies have a hard time killing them. Rumors utilize dimensional magic or science call it what you want same thing. They can stop time and teleport to any galaxy dimension or universe. Upon entering a new realm or world they take the form of the dominant species there. For example if a Rumor were to teleport to the Anturonga realm they become a Anturonga. In all realms they continue to have accessories. Rumors are able to travel through spacetime by holding their seed with their right hand. When the disappear in one place time freezes in that dimension so that the people who were just face to face with the Rumor before they disappeared will never know the Rumor went anywhere.By the Interdimensional Law and the Laws of SpaceTime a Rumor cannot take a life. They cannot kill not even to save their own live or the lives of others. They cannot kill even to perfor their sole duty to partition the realms. The reason they cannot kill is once they have taken a life they become mortal. When they become mortal all of their partitions come down. Then all of the Legends destroy the Ordinary Realms. It is complete chaos.RaptoidsRaptoids are an example of some of the few times an Ordinary has created a Legend. They first reversed biogenetically engineered raptorlike creatures using a series of regressively bread birds of prey and gene splicing. Then they made them able to consume stone and produce metal and raw materials. The purpose of their creation was to enable humans to excavate the earth for materials to build a space craft to get them off of earth. However the creatures became sentient and took over the larger of the two islands on Earth. There is a species for generally every raw material humans needed from gold to glass to silica. The Raptoid Project as it was known was awarded the grant to put their project to work by the Councilor of Earth. The Raptoid Project was founded by the company Birds of Prehistoria Inc. They had originally been trying to recreate dinosaurs for privately funded zoos.AlchemyThe act of converting objects into precious metals and materials is what is defined in this story as Alchemy. Humans created used Nanodevices robots that act as organelles within the cells enabling the alchemist to manipulate atoms of materials to convert them into more precious materials. Each alchemist is gifted with the ability to manipulate matter into a single element. No one can manage them all. For every material there is an alchemist. Steel iron even stone and earth. This was the competing project proposed by the Humans Matter Org. a nonprofit that had sought to put godlike powers in the hands of all mankind. They lost the grant to the Raptoid project and fell back on private funding. After seeing the possibilities behind the project the wealthy elite were eager to get their hands on the project. It was bought out and commercialized.,HufflepuffWriters,cvhhbw9,1,t5_32wzt
