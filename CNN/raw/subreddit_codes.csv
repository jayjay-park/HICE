Im currently working on some code thatll just brute force it but I have an idea on possibly to make it go by faster possibly. I wanna make it so that the community can just download an application and itll generate loads of results that we can just look through but I first need to make the GUI for it and make it accessible to every user and possibly add a mobile application that does the same thing so if youre just sitting around you can also do it anywhere. Im thinking that Java would be the best language for accessibility but thats just my suggestion for it. It should be done later today. Just need to figure out how to code the decrypting portion of the program. Also I was thinking that each generation that it would use a random keyword and transposition key so that possibly itll get lucky and give us something. Also it would allow us to run client side since we wouldnt need to see if that key has already been used with the corresponding keyword. Just something that Ive been thinking about lately. Especially since nows the best time and the zombies community is the largest weve had yet so hopefully people will download it and give us some good results. Lastly the randomness is possibly helpful since the chance of us getting a repeat is extremely unlikely and at this point I dont think that well actually come across something unless Revelations tells us something.EDIT Readjusted the formatting for the keyword that Ive been working with. Also added some more input that Ive been thinking of.UPDATE Ive been working on this all night and I have it deciphering the cipher with random key words and key squares. But Im heading to bed and the GUI Ill work on tomorrow. I have some ideas on how I wanna make it work but I think Ill just create a really basic one for now and go back and release more updated versions of it.,codes,d5hhgkf,2,t5_2sabs
