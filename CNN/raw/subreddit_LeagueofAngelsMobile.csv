Do you need more damage utility hybrid CC and rage drain or damage and CC or damage and heals etc?Blood Baroness is amazing in wharf boss and treasure raid depends on level. Alyssia is amazing because of debuff removal clears opponents buffs and stuns back row.My favorite offensive lineup right now is back top to center DQ Mirabelle front top to bottom Crimson Rose Astral Child Alyssia. Shuffle them around based on the opponents defense. This lineup works well with high female and magearcher emblems  the high AGI guarantees that your DQ goes first with a fire arrow and high percentage stun then Alyssia goes and possibly stuns back row. Personally these are my weakest emblems at the low k mark.My emblems are close to k for male and warriors so this lineup has been rocking it for me in arena back center to bottom Hound XO front top to bottom Minotaur Panda HorsemanI am wearing a full lvl   earth set which give my heroes a lot more health and damage reduction from opponents.,LeagueofAngelsMobile,cxjpaxz,1,t5_35qvb

7613007,0,t3_4jl8o7,I guess I am one of the few mixing FlashAssaultWarden crests. I use Earth relic and Blessing crests in  out of  of my teams. I balanced the teams so that they will have survivability and debuff removals so I am not experiencing any troubles against FireFlash teams. On some heroes using Flash is very unwise eg. Shadow Stalker. He tends to buff himself so no matter what either he will survive or diecontrolled. Ice Relic is so bad for me in the Grand Tournament that I dont like it anymore. Id rather have more  HP with shields and dodge rather than Shield which decreases your hp every fight and you get to the th floor of Angel Trials half dead and  agility boost. You are right rage gets used when the hero gets his turn but since you are using flash guess what? If my heroes are not controlled or the one who removes it is not dead  it is my turn to attack. Hope it makes sense UPD If you are really enjoying the fast meta then you should go with Fire instead of Ice relic.,LeagueofAngelsMobile,d37k52k,5,t5_35qvb

8138202,0,t3_4qp0j8,Erm firstly Flora doesnt go to level  she is  maximum. The thing with Cupid as with Pandora is they both level up to  so will ultimately be the best and are worth investing in. Both seem have to very good skills on paper as well but most of us are still building them so cant comment too much yet. I personally dropped Flora and use  Celeste Victoria and Isolde.,LeagueofAngelsMobile,d4utjys,3,t5_35qvb

8782414,0,t1_d73gi1g,I dont know the reason.  I do notice in the ultimate tournament that most of the top teams dont use her on their main team but in the second or third teams.I have her maxed astral but not nexus.  It might just be that and when I max her nexus she wont die as quickly.Thing is DQ has my best crests and everything but my SQ seems to do more for me since she hits the whole line with crit whereas DQ only hits two people.,LeagueofAngelsMobile,d73h1rf,1,t5_35qvb
8841052,0,t1_d7aj1o8,I think she sucks but its not her fault. The game mechanics are to blame.   The original purpose of tanks is to protect squishy DDssupports by soaking up damage. Shes great for the latter but just as most tanks in this game she lacks hard in the first part. She cannot protect anything.    Shes just like a single brick wall standing in front of you...sure effort needed to tear her down but she just stands there. No threat and nothing forces you to tear her down first. Easy to go around her and kill the real threats first.   Sure if the opponent just slams into the wall instead of going around it shes great but then the opponent does something wrong.,LeagueofAngelsMobile,d7akhv8,1,t5_35qvb
8854514,0,t1_d7c6a29,I think Nereida is so under rated on here.  I am doing her up for my second team.As to Pyro she isnt rated on the tier list but the guy that makes all those vids uses her and think she is great and one punk army is using her too.I dunno.  I think that tier list spreadsheet gets taken as gospel too much.  If anything I think it is a little outdated especially since awakening has changed the power level for a lot of heroes.If I had taken it as gospel I wouldnt have used GR or BB.  Both consider not great on the spreadsheet.   I think SQ is also under rated and she be the same level of DQ if not more.,LeagueofAngelsMobile,d7c6r3i,1,t5_35qvb

That would help with getting these same divinities AND leveling them. This event is garbage Imho.,LeagueofAngelsMobile,d7p8ngj,2,t5_35qvb

9126386,0,t1_d88t1de,Oh I agree Id never pay to unsocket a crest at the cost they put on it but the way they value stuff amazes me.  for part of an angel that will get obsoleted in a month? No thanks.  outlet tickets for a Divinite? WTF?! Whole game is a rip off IMO.I took off a whole set of crests on a character. Just wrote it off as another rip off in a rip off designed game. Like deliberately putting spend diamond button right where the confirm button goes in AT... I think their CS is a joke and wouldnt waste more time contacting them since now my diamonds come from game and not . I dont think they could put out another event that would tempt me to recharge. Or Recaharage as LoA calls it. Ill probably delete it when I hit level  anyhow. Spending hours and hours clicking astral stones one by one waiting for the right stat increases and hundreds and thousands of max upgrade button presses on Nexus isnt exactly a compelling game. ,LeagueofAngelsMobile,d88ucno,1,t5_35qvb
9165658,0,t3_55rdlx,Personally Id recommend DQ LE Draconia Panda and AB. Also look at some older posts on this subreddit as there are several people asking about their lineup almost every week  ,LeagueofAngelsMobile,d8dtbgx,1,t5_35qvb
9195787,0,t3_569ck9,No thing is it is decided based on your ancient arena br. The top  have fairly more br then your anceint arena team and the first  have a bit less. Just keep your br down in ancient arena. What i do is i put all my strong heroes in team  and  in ancient arena and the third team has the lowest br heroes and angels as you only need to win  fights to win.,LeagueofAngelsMobile,d8hmtos,1,t5_35qvb
9198532,0,t3_56bvrf,Hi. On the first team I think I would have put draconia behind panda just so she doesnt die in case the opponent has a faster draconia in the same line. I feel panda would be better in the revive slot since he is slow and you can get by without relying on his first skill should he die. You however want draconia to get her instakill off all the time which she cant do if she dies to a faster draconia. I also like having draconia in the bottom line since it makes for a harder counter. In case the opponent counters her with dp or something they lose their revive slot which could have been used for some other more useful hero if he doesnt run a triple front. On the second team maybe I would put shadow stalker in the rear just so dp can soak  lines of damagers. If you want him to rage faster though then its fine. I would also think that the revive slot would be better used for green ranger. Depends on how good his stats are i guess. Third team i dont see anything worth mentioning. Open middlefront formation for me is just a way to divert  lines of damage to  tanky hero or a hero I would like to build rage on quickly or it can also be used to keep  hero safe from a good front line hitting hero or team. Triple front is for when I want to build rage on  heroes or protect  hero from a backline hitting team or hero or if i want to put a draconiacountering hero across a bottom line draconia and still have a more useful hero in the revive slot . So basically U shaped formations arent necessarily better than what you are doing it just depends where they predict certain heroes will be placed. ,LeagueofAngelsMobile,d8hzcl4,1,t5_35qvb

9800468,0,t1_dakzn5r,Headless is not a guaranteed silence. He misses his silence very often. I have to pair him up with Exorcist if I want to make it to the end of timer. Bamboo Warrior amp Blade are also not guaranteed stuns. Mysterious Count may not be a guaranteed stun either but he does more damage than Aurora Blade and maximizing damage is my goal.Mermaid is a better frontrow healer than LP. In certain Treasure Raid battles that only attack the frontrow Mermaid is better at keeping my tanks alive.Byron is still amazing for Gold Trial and Boss Invasion. Paired with Nightblade and Astrea they can maintain CC on the boss.DS was a good tank but my Dark Pal and Headless became better at tanking.BombmasterBlazing Soul still outdamage all paragons in WharfTreasure Raid.,LeagueofAngelsMobile,dal4aj9,1,t5_35qvb
