9232571,0,t3_56tiaj,Financial advisor here You mentioned that its his personal savings but also that his work is making recommendations is this money tax qualified or nonqual.? It would certainly make a difference in how beneficial any annuity would be. Second does he have a retirement plan? Specifically has your father detailed his goals throughout retirement. I ask this because the best financial solutions are always the ones that are tailored to a persons financial goals. Consider that if he have any nearterm retirement goals extra travel while young major purchase RV timeshares home improvements or any other higher expenses early on locking money up in an annuity with a level lifetime payout for life might not be the best choice. Additionally you can often find annuities for sale to the public that might be a better fit more features higher payout and with remaining balances going to the this heirs rather than the insurance co keeping it. An annuity could be a good fit but there are a lot of variables to consider. By going with the annuity any annuity there are also various degrees of commitment as well to consider. So lock you up for life while other with protect his capitol and grow it modestly yet give him full choice and control after only a few years.Separate from annuities if you look across the investment landscape conservative investors are having a very challenging time right now. The years US T is paying a modest . net of inflation and taxes that is likely a negative return. In additional if rates rises he face the duration risk having his bond portfolio far in value. There is no simple solution. Getting a better understanding of his various financial priorities would be a great place to start. Your advice of lets not jump into anything is on point take your time Best wishes.,investing_discussion,d8manzb,5,t5_2y4av

11325887,0,t1_dfeeom7,Thank you for the reply!  Can you please let me know how I can practice trading options on TOS?  I am going to Options HackergtgtScan and nothing pops up.  Looking forward to your reply!,investing_discussion,dffrqxo,1,t5_2y4av
11326861,0,t1_dfftvij,The reason I asked is because I didnt know what it was hahaha so proves how much I know! I am trying it now and it seems to be working but I cant really get it to show me anything useful quite yet definitely going to be playing around with this hacker alot in the future so thanks! So what I do is I go to the trade tab instead of the scan tab I only trade options in big name stocks and ETFs so I just skim through a list I have on my phone until I find an implied volatility or chart I like i recently made a play in GOOG for example. Then you pick your expiration date which I pick around  days out so in this case I picked the April  drop tab. I mostly use vertical spreads or iron condors and I decided I dont think google will drop under  or  so I right clicked on the put side at the  strike price and selected sell and then selected vertical. If youve managed to follow my crappy instructions this far then you should see the vertical spread or whatever other option strategy you chose to buy or sell pop up somewhere on the bottom half of your screen. THEN before I confirm and send I right click on the spread and click analyse trade this will bring you to a beautiful chart that shows your exact profit  loss diagram and is the reason why I love ToS so much! Before I submit any trade I always analyse it first cause its a great way to try visualize the different strategies. I normally try to close my positions early to limit my risk the longer your in a position the more chance it has to drop on you and the analyse trade diagram will show  lines one in blue that reps the profit or loss at expiration and one in purple that reps the profit or loss if you decide to close out early and take your winnings or losings depends what the price is at in that moment. I really hope this was helpful even though this is a noob teaching a noob hahaha! I started paper trading early January and have turned that  into  so far so I am pretty confident even though Im a beginner and its been a trump boom the last few months so it would have probably been harder to lose money hahahaha! Please please please ask me if you have any questions about anything options related no matter what it is! They say the best way to learn is to teach so we can learn together hahaha! ,investing_discussion,dffvq0y,2,t5_2y4av
