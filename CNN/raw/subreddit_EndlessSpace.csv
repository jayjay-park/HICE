122392,0,t1_cesclkc,You will generally get the most MP out of many smaller ships yes but that does not mean they will be the best fleet. I used to make long range kin ships with minimal defenses they would work   but die often. They also had a lot of issues with the Harmony ships late game for me so I changed my fleet based on how the Harmony built theirs.Ended up building dreadnoughts with  of each defense a repair module  or  armor plates as many bombers as you can fit and the rest of the tonnage on melee kin. Ive never lost one of those dreads and as long as the bombers are alive they can kill pretty much anything. An added bonus since the MP of that fleet is so low the AI are very willing to attack them which helps a lot when they start stacking  fleets on one planet. A useful thing to know is that repair modules will recover bombers over time so you dont need to spend dust on them.As for the difference between weapons. I find youre better off sticking to their preferred range because you can put more on. But more importantly is to use the one that your enemy has the least defense for. That all being said Ive never done any sort of testing on that at all.,EndlessSpace,cesd9ld,3,t5_2tpth

4035093,0,t1_crg1eob,Yep. Everything on the planet view when building ships or improvements beside the cancel building is buyout which finishes the build so it will be ready next turn. This is really good for getting new planets up and running quickly. ,EndlessSpace,crg8bs4,1,t5_2tpth

5118094,0,t1_cusjulk,I edit the XML files containing the hero definitions and remove almost all the hybrid heroes like adminpilot.  That greatly increases the likely hood that you start with a solid AdminCorporate hero.  You could do the same thing via a mod but then you wouldnt get achievements.,EndlessSpace,cv2x79c,3,t5_2tpth

5950126,0,t3_3we26a,Thanks for posting this here  I check the forums frequently and Im glad to see that your work is not only in a state of semicompletion but that you plan to keep on working on it!Loving the look of the tweaks youve made  Ill definitely be investing some time to look into this ,EndlessSpace,cxzlb62,2,t5_2tpth
6187645,0,t3_40a44x,I hear ya. Combat can be difficult to design in games and Endless Space certainly has its flaws in that category.Itd be cool if you could like have spies that update you on the ships other races are designing. So you have a general idea what youre up against. Then again part of the fun is being surprised and having to quickly recover and defend against a previously unknown threat. Ive been in those situations where I find myself outclassed or outnumbered by someone but I usually end up redesigning some ships massproducing them and defending myself. Thats all part of the game right? Of course I havent been playing this game too long. And Im sure Id get my ass thoroughly handed to me by human players.,EndlessSpace,cysyxwg,1,t5_2tpth
6192103,0,t1_cyte204,Cheers! Ill give that a shot. I experimented with a Cruiser running pure LR kinetics and it seemed to do better than my mixeduse Destroyersize fleets but I might have just been outteched.

9695696,0,t3_5dippj,I guess you fundamentally disagree on what build and conquest mean because alot of us feel that managing things like morale population rebellions citizen happiness culture spread etc are an integrate part of a realistic build and conquer scenario. An empire is made of people.   People dont obey you long term if you dont keep them happy.   Theyre obey you short term out of fear but fear has its limits.     When they stop being afraid to die you lose all power over them. It sounds to me like what you want is a conquest game with with robots instead of human beings.  or sentient alien beings as the case may be,EndlessSpace,da87821,5,t5_2tpth
10115865,0,t3_5k7c3f,Developer menu they use to mess around and test stuff. Dunno how to get to it.,EndlessSpace,dbq3sqq,1,t5_2tpth
10525235,0,t1_dcypabn,Do you like it more than Endless Spaces web tech tree? Because I really liked it and it was so unique.  Im sad to see it go but havent played ES yet to know if the new one is decent.,EndlessSpace,dd15ek2,1,t5_2tpth
10557642,0,t3_5r680j,Im also new to ES but I have played both EL and ES. The two things to pay attention too are your ship design and the combat cards. In ship design you can have four basic weapons missile kinetic beam and laser. Missile and laser are optimal at long range and kinetic and beam are optimal at ahort range. Then there are shield and hull shields are good against lasers and beam and hull is good against missile and kinetic.Now right before a battle starts you get to choose a combat card to play. These cards determine the ranges each flotilla engages at you can tell what formation your flotillas will take by looking at the arrows on the card also you do not nessisarly get to use three flotillas. Note that your opponent also plays a card and the combination of the two determine the distance of each flotilla at each stage of combat. You can choose different cards for your deck the option for that is in the ship tab on the left hand side easy to miss.Also Im still new to ES so if I made any mistakes feel free to correct me. Hope this was helpful!,EndlessSpace,dd4ttmg,3,t5_2tpth
10570862,0,t1_dd69bse,Hmmm Im not sure I see what youre referring to.,EndlessSpace,dd6auy0,1,t5_2tpth
10784890,0,t1_dds9fyf,Nice wall of text m D Im not offended I simply asked to not force your own taste on others. Instead give pluscons which you did later and let them decide if its game for them. Yes their question can be answered a lot better than I didnt like it avoid it at all costs. Like I said recommending games by simply saying get it because I liked it is JUST as useless. And I did say in the original post that I saw you gave reasoning in later post all I asked is to include that in the first post in the future.To me it seems you either dont understand what Im saying or you are not reading it all.Incase you still dont understand I wrote my initial reply before I found your detailed explanation further down the comments  not good!,EndlessSpace,ddsdspb,1,t5_2tpth
11176747,0,t3_5zj9h9,Get endless space. I bought stellaris and I ended up getting a steam refund after a few hours. Im not saying its a bad game but didnt care for it. I like endless space  a LOT better. Its pretty far along. There is a roadmap here on this subreddit and if Im not mistaken there were  updates planned with the third one coming soon. Right now you can start a game and play most of the mechanic to get a feel for the game and learn. I just started a playthrough and Im really enjoying. ,EndlessSpace,deyve3k,9,t5_2tpth
11299911,0,t1_dfcllnt,It could be but  speed reduction is really damaging in those first dozen turns where expansion is vital. On top of this pirates are faster than your ships by a lot which means those extra  turns it takes to get down a particularly long hyperspace lane can really burn you for credits.Mind you this can still be played around if youre smart about it but it is a major hinderance.,EndlessSpace,dfctto2,3,t5_2tpth
11325897,1,t1_dffkfv4,Nah Stellaris at release was way way more game than ES after expansions. Not sure about bugs though I didnt really encounter any shrug.,EndlessSpace,dffrsej,0,t5_2tpth
11578132,0,t1_dg8de3x,Just a thought but you may want to look into permanently remove game from library. It probably have side effects like losing achievements and logged hours.  If anything this should be a last resort if you really want the dlc,EndlessSpace,dg8dylw,1,t5_2tpth
11763331,0,t3_67s7x4,I have  h in endless space  ... And i am ashamed to admit i havent a clue ...  What i wanted to say is i want to know this too,EndlessSpace,dgteihm,7,t5_2tpth
11777876,0,t3_681ef9,One of the things that they do to address the issue with techs and buildings that I think is really nice is that they colorcode everything.  Industry techs and buildings are orange dust is yellow science is blue etc.  They are also grouped together in the building list too with the cheapest ones first in the list.  So when youre new you can engage at that level and not get dragged down too much by the flavor and lore until it becomes more secondnature.  Which it does eventually become.For luxury resources yeah they are a little out there and theres no good way to know what they might do for you unless youve been playing a while andor have played a lot of ES and EL.I do like that theres so much depth to the world and lore of ES.  Many players put hundreds of hours into x games they like and having a way to engage a little more deeply each time you play even after so much time really improves the experience.,EndlessSpace,dgv25ox,13,t5_2tpth
