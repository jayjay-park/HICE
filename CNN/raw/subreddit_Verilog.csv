4012156,0,t1_crdj39y,Yes thats the effect Im trying to achieve but Im trying to do it inside foo.  That is the instantiator of foo has two distinct signals and I want to wire them together in foo.,Verilog,crdm7pa,1,t5_2sy9x
6701724,0,t3_479ioi,Ok I see what you did there. I will try and fix my variable output names.There are some conceptual problems here due to my poor understanding of what is possible in verilog. Will post an updated text file at the end of the night . Cheers Snooki,Verilog,d0cilj3,1,t5_2sy9x
7290146,0,t1_d26r7hr,In this case I could use an RS flip flop to set the new number that was divided by  and then restore once the counter goes to the maximum number? So for example if I input mHz have it divide by  each time and count to  periods.. the counter would divide by  store it until it reaches the th period then reset? ,Verilog,d26u9my,1,t5_2sy9x
9618949,0,t3_59gg1t,An  deep lookup table would not be unusual  though I assume you are using a power of  entries ?Sine generation requores  things  a phase accumulator and a phase to amplitude conversion pac. The lookup table achieves the pac and a counter implements the phase accumulator.  For an initial version to make life easier fill the table with a full period of a sine wave. Plot the values of each entry to confirm they are indeed representing a sine wave.  The phase accumulator can step in variable amounts but for a simple implementation make it a counter with  bits counting by . This will cycle through each entry of the table and then wrap back to the start.  If you see nofunny output at the dac confirm you are talking to it properly by sending some known constant values. Ensure the bit ordering signed vs unsigned and communication method to the dac are all working before testing with the sine wave generator. Also simulating he output that would be sent to the dac will help you narrow down issues.  Finally once that is all working you can modify your pac to use a  wave and some logic to reduce the table size  and add a variable counter step to allow multiple frequencies to be generated. Best of luck.,Verilog,d9yqera,1,t5_2sy9x
