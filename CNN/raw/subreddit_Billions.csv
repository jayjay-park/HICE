6286531,0,t3_41h7v8,The only thing that bothered me in the first episode was the pairing of Siff with Giamatti.  I was curious to see if this would go away but it still lingers for me in this episode.  Does anyone else notice a lack of chemistry between these two? I thought it might be an age thing but it turns out the actors are only seven years apart however Giamatti still comes across as very old in scenes with Siff to me. To the point that if he was playing a grandfather I think that would be easier to buy into.,Billions,cz47hkx,8,t5_2z1d2

Because it happens everyday in a quite legal fashion. Now you may consider yourself an expert on Google but you still have to  read all the information presented. Words matter and it is important that we use the right words when discussing these issues.  From the for more information section of the link you posted gt Insider trading is a term subject to many definitions and connotations and it encompasses both legal and prohibited activity. Insider trading takes place legally every day when corporate insiders  officers directors or employees  buy or sell stock in their own companies within the confines of company policy and the regulations governing this trading. ,Billions,d1hd59s,2,t5_2z1d2

9081623,0,t3_54lzxx,I dont think it comes as a surprise that a serialized drama such as this and others take their cues from a chess match as youve described.  Its what gives them a bit more depth and caters to a more discerning and intelligent audience.  That being said the dialogue really bothered me throughout the first season and I dont think how intricate of a web they tried to weave excused that.  The writing could definitely be punched up going into the sophomore season but I havent read any grumblings from the shows network or creative team so Im doubtful of any changes being made.,Billions,d83gp6m,3,t5_2z1d2

11598657,0,t1_dgan220,k divded by  is around .k per daySome hookers only do hooking after work. And they do weekends. Occasionally there are whales who can book long hours or even overnight booking.And for college students they have a lot more time since they can pick their classes to have some extra weekday off. And they obviously have long school breaks during which they can do it full time.So half a mil is not unrealistic. Its really crazy money.I only came to this realization when I told an escort I make much more than average wage and she didnt seem any impressed by that. After I came back home I thought about it and realized how much she could potentially be making lol... I mean thats better than a lot of lawyers hourly rate and lawyers have to use their brain to fight hooker just spread their legs and enjoy the sex and collecting a lot of money at the same time lol I was always puzzled why some of these girls young and really stunning didnt just find a sugar daddy. Now I finally understand they dont need one and very few sugar daddies would give out half a million to a girlfriend anyways .

11717733,0,t1_dgo7j3e,Agreed.  Lara is not my favorite.  It seems that her entire purpose is to show Axe is human and has a heart.  Given the huge array of stellar acting talent and complex characters on this show I almost resent her for taking screen time away from the more interesting people and story lines.,Billions,dgo8fui,28,t5_2z1d2
11723482,0,t1_dgosmif,This brings up an interesting point.  Laras brother is defending her without understanding whether she was in the right or the wrong in this matter.  I have a feeling that the writers are presenting her as a character who has always been in a position where she is protected and as a result she has developed what I would characterize as a personality disorder of an egomaniac with an inferiority complex.  My reaction to the brother is the opposite of Bobbies.  If he is protecting her when she is wrong then he is just doing her a diservice.   Wendy put her right in her place with a succinct diagnosis by telling Lara what she needed to hear and not what she wanted to hear.  Pretty much what Bobbie did when he dissected her business plan earlier.  The only thing missing was Wendy suggesting that Lara cultivate an attitude of gratitude.  Laras biggest challenge is dealing with the absolute lack of challenges in her life so she has to create problems where none existed.  In a perfect world the I feel sorry for Lara fanclub should never have more than one member.  ,Billions,dgovxtm,1,t5_2z1d2
