9778881,0,t1_dai714j, After faking interest in ads what were you able to get them to do? That would good evidence against them. Define critical mass of businesses? Are we looking at . because thats literally what  business will give you? The main flaw I see about your argument is that the tactics youre suggesting that exist are clearly against their Advertiser FAQ which theyve had in place since . If there were a widespread issue there definitely would have been some whistleblowing in  years. Yet weve never seen that. Theres a pretty damning lack of evidence of such wrongdoing.Instead what is see are individual sales agents taking matters into their own hands. For example Sales Agent X tries to sell advertising to a business. A business complains about the negative reviews due to crappy Yelp sorting and heavyhandedly pressures Sales Agent X to do something about it. Sales Agent X goes through the regular channels that ALL normal Yelp users have to report bad reviews. They might have a better chance by knowing some trick that has a higher chance of being successful e.g. reporting multiple times. As a result some of those bad reviews are removed. None of this is against Yelp policy. And so far theres been no evidence that there exists an internal route for reporting that has a higher chance of success. Now if that route did exist and were being abused Id love to hear about it because it would be exactly what we need to prove Yelp of misconduct.gt There is a direct correlation between yelp sorting position and those that advertise having a higher position.What kind of Yelp sorting do you mean? Are you talking about review sorting or the businesss position when searching for the type of business in Yelp? If its the former please provide evidence.,Yelp,daignjz,1,t5_2qjxc
