1057046,0,t1_cgguhxq,Wouldnt the creation of an entirely new universe necessarily  involve a big bang involving massive amounts of energy? How can a universe be created simply by making a choice? Jumping between already existing worlds could be plausible but when we talk about worlds being spontaneously created without the corresponding energy I have trouble believing it. It seems like we have a thermodynamics problem. ,timetravel,chofvj4,1,t5_2qhjv
1062895,0,t1_chgywum,But timelines do split naturally. Go look up the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.Basically there is a quantum random. Many worlds hypothesizes that both results happen and are simply alternate universes. Time travel would simply be traveling down a different one of these.Also look into determinism. Which would mean that the time travel was predetermined and thus no change is really occurring.,timetravel,chp3tga,1,t5_2qhjv
1148090,0,t1_chyrqd9,Hypothetically I would say the prevailing future belief would be that Universes themselves are very similar to organisms or organisms copy the nature of universes as above so below  in that Universes reproduce asexually via black holes which have their own spacetimeother properties  and each of them come from one above them.  how comes the question where did the first one come from?  Is it a bootstrap where the last universe gives birth to the first?  Is all of it some petri dish in a lab in another universe made from universes?  Has it been just going on eternally with no begining?  Who can say or even speculate ever no matter how much knowledge is amassed?  I will say this though.  From the perspective of each universe its parent outerverse amp and child blackholes all exist at once its beginning and end happening at the same time.  As well from each of those that universe in question is all happening at once.  We conscious beings exist in the image of the universe.  Now if you ask me if I believe in God as put forth in any texts today or through history I will say no.  I dont think the universe or even planet was made in  days.  This being said reality doesnt just have one absolute it moves in several directions at once.  Being that the multiverse which i do believe in but have no evidence towards exists outside of the outerverse universe innerverses.  Reality itself separates and divides and in fact the entire reason that consciousness exists is to speed up the cell division of multiverses for the organsim that forms from all of those almost identical cells made by multiverse growth.  Of course that is just based on faith and irrelevant to anything occuring inside this universe.  I should also make clear the multiple divergent timelines would exist within the black hole that makes up this universe and not in the universe above it.  They would be completely different. All hypothetical of course.,timetravel,chyru5b,1,t5_2qhjv

6130509,0,t1_cym1m38,Oh no event  is where F travels back in time TO event . Event  then would be when P and F meet. You are very right that F is truly just P and that P will become F after  more events. My very point is that in Fs time line we see that  events lead to F going back in time. Since P and F have the exact same time line we know that the exact same  events will happen to P. In this logic since P and F meet in Ps time line at event  then P and F meet in Fs time line as well. P and F ARE the same person and running along the same time line. My point was to show that no paradox is achieved in these  events because none of the  events are being rewritten by Fs actions. ,timetravel,cymh43e,1,t5_2qhjv

8166230,0,t1_d4vmcu3,Chinese and Hindu mythology both have about  immortals each although there might be some overlap.  They usually become impatient trying to direct and influence the lives of mortal men because you can lead a horse to water but you cant make him drink then they go off into the mountains and become hermits for a time before they show up again.  I think being a time time traveler or being very smart for your time and place in history can be emotionally the same thing.  You could always invent a new technology or philosophy or language but you cant control how they are used and every culture has its own values which may be different from yours.  You could even invent a new religion effectively inventing a new culture out of an old one but your ability to influence an area would be limited by the means of communication and your willingness to travel.  And even then you put a ton of effort into a people and boom in come the invading Mongols.  Then it is blend back into the populace and start over.,timetravel,d4ybthd,3,t5_2qhjv
