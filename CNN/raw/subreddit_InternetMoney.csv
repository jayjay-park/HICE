11576934,0,t3_635edi,HeyIm also a producer from the UK starting to build my YouTube channel. Ive noticed the more beats I post on YouTube the more I get back in commentslikessubs  just recently broke  subs its not a massive amount but its ok for me considering I only really started this since late Jan properly. As for making type beats  I just make beats and once theyre done I sit with them on loop for a while and think who I can hear on them sometimes ill ask my Mrs or a friend on Twitter if I cant think of any. Id say just dive right in man and stay consistent. Good luck. ,InternetMoney,dg892i7,1,t5_2s06w
