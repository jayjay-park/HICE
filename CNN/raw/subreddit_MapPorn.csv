9316,0,t1_cefhnx8,Religion has a lot to do with it. They themselves make it a point that theyre different with their religious heritage. There are many other poor regions in France which arent that bad because they either dont have an aggressive religion Vietnamese Chinese Buddhist neighborhoods are doing fine or because theyre Christian or hardly religious and thus dont feel different from the rest of France  and thus dont feel in conflict with France.You need to understand that Islam is a very strong religion and can easily be used as a differentiating factor as an identity in opposition to their adoptive country.Im not even trying to be islamophobic as people like you try to call us. As a Frenchman Ive known countless Muslims who are obviously mostly perfectly nice people who just want to live peacefully.

I think your voter counterargument is more flawed than the original argument though. Wantedness is not as correlated with political affiliation as income. Youre implying that it is only low income mothers who abort children while the majority in the s were actually middle class mothers.

There is no difference between the two.gt  Republics are not by rule considered the poorest part of RussiaSure they are.gt The land is now Federal and they still kept and continue to keep their cultures.Just like the natives on reservation.gt To call this all extermination is ludicrous.Thats what it was. So the minorities you list are each less than  of the siberian population. And you ignore the countless minorites that are practically extinct like the ainu. Where did all these siberians go? gt nonRussian peoples are not marginalized by the state and and are respected for their culture for their actions and for their service to the Federation.Yes they are.gt As for Tuva it was controlled by China until the revolutions of the first part of th century.And?gt The Russian people had assisted both Mongolia and Tannu Tuva during their acts for independence.What a fucking moron. The russian people assisted mongolia and tuva and then betrayed them by annexing them. Is tuva free? Nope. Also there is a reason why the mongolians hate russians.gt The Tuvan state joined as a part of the RSFSR while Mongolia decided to stay independant.Oh so tuvan state is not independent. I guess the russians arent good at anything especially freeing countries. Tuva joined as much as poland east germany etc joined the warsaw pact. As for mongolia the russians kept it as a puppet slave state until the collapse of the soviet union. Thats why the mongols despise and distrust the russians. ,MapPorn,cen4e4m,-5,t5_2si92

Spain was in the midst of various civil wars and was not measurably bettergoverned than its former colonies in South America. Calling it enlightened was a stretch. The Papal State would be more civilized instead of enlightened as the Pope at the time was rather reactionary and against technological progress.Japan would qualify as civilized if the original mapmaker had accurate information though not being Christian probably wouldnt qualify as enlightened.

Think CanadaUS. Western Australia on the other hand doesnt have the need to assert any sort of national identity other than an Australian one.That said there is a greater exchange of population between the west and east than there is between Aus and NZ leading to a greater intermingling between those cultures. The west and east also watch the same television shows whereas NZ has its own shows though they do watch plenty of Australian TV too.WA doesnt have a unique accentdialect apart from a few different words here and there. Accents in Australia can be divided into three main spikes on a spectrum of accents broad which is your Steve Irwin accent general which most Australians speak and cultivated which is very similar to the snobby upperclass British accent youre familiar with. These are primarily determined by socioeconomic status rather than geography. So for example WA has more people speaking broad accents than say Victoria but a broad WA accent is the same as a broad Victorian accent. New Zealand does have a distinct accent though most foreigners cant distinguish them from Australian accents.So to answer your question no there is virtually no cultural difference between WA and the eastern states.

Population density offers a much more accurate understanding of how largesmall something is.By raw population Anchorage AK is a larger city than Sarasota FL it has  people. That makes it seem much larger than Sarasota until you realize that the city of Anchorage covers  sq mi and has a population density of about  peoplesq mi. Having lived in both places Ill tell you that Sarasota is quite a bit larger. In fact the metro area there is almost as big as the entire population of Alaska.But whatever dude.

How big business effects government in the US could arguably undermine both definitions government by the people a government in which the SUPREME power is held by the people. I dont think thats the case with the US the government is neither formed by the people in a true sense lobbying corporate sponsorship nor are its major decisions affected by the people. In order for this definition to fit the United States people would need to vote on legislation. I think this explains the shift from using the term indirect democracy to representative democracy in social sciences here in Western Europe because indirect democracy is almost an oxymoron it would be like calling a train from London to Brussels and indirect train to Paris and anyone interested in creating a democratic society would avoid systems like the representative one in the United States. In the US the system representation is built on isnt truly democratic at all. Again not in the classical Greek or libertarian socialist sense at least or even in the sense of the definition you have just given. Edit Im in a rush here and I feel as though this response was serving you up some word soup but this is just my opinion. The centrist and Capitalist definitions dont consider the US representative system or indirect democracy as useless at all.,MapPorn,cffzlte,1,t5_2si92

I normally hate pranks but this is too perfect.Spelunk down ahead of an expedition of your friends with a group of paid actors. You could set up any number of mind bending horrors in the depth of that cave. It would be expensive and horribly inconvenient but all so worth it.. Leave strange signs of possible human habitation in a cave area Stone bowls and knives. Bones and scraps of unknown animal. Freak them out. Have a group of men strip down cover themselves in white chalky substance milky white contacts and carry stone spears. Appear around one of the corners deep in the cave. Shouting in an alien tongue..

This pretty accurately sums up my experiences  both the above subjects require different levels of learning and different levels of understanding. The key is not to assume both are the same.Im glad you agree on the CAO thing  the thoughts of a course being inherently more hardeasy just because of the points was really the big thing that annoyed me.

773587,0,t1_cgs3491,I appreciate the candor of your response and I agree with you on almost everything. I do feel there needs to be some form of punishment in society if only as a deterrent for people smart enough to cheat the system in order to get ahead and believe me there are tons of smart criminals be they violent or not. Theres just too much incentive to act against society in terms of taking advantage of the people for personal gain. These are all ideals of course and straying from the point that you make about the vast majority of people in prison that shouldnt be there. Its shocking to me that things like th War on drugs mandatory minimums privatized prisons etc. exist and they should all be evaluated and IMO no longer exist. I dont necessarily want drug dealers to go free but people who are dependent upon drugs and just happen to get popped a bunch of times dont need to be the people we go after on the streets but they are always the most easily caught. Mandatory minimums maybe just a USA thing? are a joke and end up getting a large ring of smalltime criminals and letting the bigtimers go free.

And heres some fancier analysisgt Drawing on Jane Jacobs  theories of urbanism and the occurrence ofcrime it was hypothesized that population density at the census block level would negatively predict violentcrime in the urban areas. Based on evidence of a nonlinear relationship between crime and densityRegoeczi  it was conversely hypothesized that density would have a positive predictive effect onviolent crime in the suburban areas due to differences in urban and suburbanrural crime.

1092958,0,t1_chrul9p,The collapse of Christian Democrats and the Socialist Party didnt really help him but forced him. He was used to pay  these people friendship when the judges have exposed the corruption erasing these parties he was forced to build a new party from scratch to keep the control of part of the state. Otherwise for the first time in history the left that was barely touched by corruption could have controlled the country. The last time something similar was about to happen red terrorists kidnaped and killed the prime minister with the secret service alleged help and probably CIA  a communist friendly government in western europe could have changed the world .Berlusconi started with a massive ad campaign on his newspapers and tv networks where his paid tv stars were already endorsing him in shows. He rented a cruise boat to travel around the country pickup cars with big speakers and his recorded voice localized for every city he published a photo book of his family with his fictionalized story and sent it for free in every single house of the country. The amount of money he spent was huge  still payoff though . Before him parties used billboards and debates to inform people nobody knew a leader wife and the leader himself wasnt more important than the content. He transformed politics into a show. He basically imported all the bad things of american politics. As soon as they got the power the left was forced to pass a law to forbid political ads on national tv just to get rid of all the massive pointless spam and the antidemocratic abomination where a berlusconi enemy had to pay him to spread his message. They also introduced a cool off month before election where all the journalistic shows have to give equal time to all parties doesnt matter how much money you have. Berlusconi never touched these laws worried about a much more damaging real american antitrust law. This also didnt stop him to convert  of the  major national tv into FoxNews like network where political ads werent really needed anymore. You can imagine why it took so much time to get rid of him.I dont know about india but I would say italy is not much different from the rest of europe and its  main families socialist and peoples. But you cant say Socialists in italy because they were a corrupted rightwing party in disguise responsible for berlusconis economic success before his political life. Names can also be quite confusing in italy communists were more liberal than berlusconi and berlusconis liberal party is the conservative side of italy.Grillo has a role and his party is actually a needed watchdog to keep the others in check.Berlusconis presidentialization project did fail in the best way possible. Faces and leaders are important now and this responsabilize candidates but the party is still in charge and no single one has the power. This is actually what let the democratic party renew himself in few months while running the country changing the former prime minister without the bloodbath of another election campaign something americans usually misunderstood like the legal system. On the other side berlusconis party that lived with the leadership cult will die without one.,MapPorn,chsiucd,1,t5_2si92

A Republican would have been just as hesitant. Neoconservativeinfluenced interventionist foreign policy took a big hit after Iraq but both parties still have it on their platforms public opinion permitting.As it is Obama has limited himself to covert operations and drone strikes in territory with and without the explicit approval of the host states. We still conduct strikes in Pakistan even though the Pakistanis havent granted permission to do so in quite some time.I guess my point is you cant call Republicans extreme without calling Democrats extreme.

Direct rule of Tibet would have been hugely expensive and an administrative nightmare.

1489363,0,t1_cj2fcx1,gtOther nations dont want the US to impose democracy on them as much as Americans thinks those other nations want them The Bush foreign policy is definitely an outlier in terms of how we usually conduct ourselves.  That rhetoric was pretty unique to his administration given that it was the one time it was actually enforced by the military.  In terms of just promoting values lip service has always been paid to democracy but hardly much more than that.You might think that the support of parts of the Arab spring during the Obama administration represents a continuation albeit toned down of the Bush era enforcement of democracy but it really isnt.  The US policy was aimed at stability in the region period.  The difference is the calculus changed from support the iron fist to support the mass protests and keep transition peaceful.If we were really committed to democracy at all costs and we never really were it was just convenient in  then you would have seen us pull funding from Egypt.  We didnt of course because that would have been incredibly destabilizing given how much of their GDP comes from their military spending.  You can see where were still trying to figure this thing out too.  Policy for Libya and Syria are opposites.  In Libya we and mostly Europe intervened.  The case was at the time that a destabilizing civil war will make the country a haven for unsavory types.  The problem was of course that it happened anyway despite the relative quickness of victory there.Syria on the other hand we decided to let play out.  I think we can all agree the Libya type response would have yielded better results because there is no way an organization like ISIS could germinate in the amount of time it would have taken us to overthrow the regime in Syria.  So in conclusion you kangaroo face our foreign policy is extremely outward looking and not at all democracy based like people seem to think. ,MapPorn,cj2ysvx,1,t5_2si92

NEVER play a small nation in any Paradox game unless you know what youre doing. Stick to it till you learn the ropes Army and Naval use Raising troopsships how to move them where you want and how much you need to fight an enemy. A good tactic when fighting it to make a big army and shatter your enemies armies before carpet sieging their turf by breaking your big army into lots of little ones. And how to siegeassault always keep more men in a siege than the defenders have in garrison and if you want to assault you need at least ten times as many infantry as the garrison does to do it safely. Diplomacy Make allies lots of them though pick ones that arent liable to get you into lots of fights. Royal marriages are a good tool for expansion. Oh and military access get it why? If a nation wants to declare war on you they need to remove it first so its a good warning that someone is about to turn hostile. Colonization You need a navy here or else pirates are going to murder your income. Also be careful about your income Colonies are huge money losers while theyre still being made. Most of the time you dont really need troops in your colonies since theyre both your culture and religion so they usually docile. Unless you took over native nations or your neighbors colonies then I would suggest at least k army around. Your Leader If hes an idiot hell never die and if hes a genius hell die usually while hes still the heir. If an idiot make him a general and send him on suicidal battles to kill him off if a genius keep him in the capital and never send him out on his own without at least a huge army at his back. Casus Belli The main thing that will stop your expansion honestly luck is usually a key here unless you got lots of spies for obscure documents. Spies Save them for the ability Infiltrate Administration lets you instantly see everything whatever nation you infiltrated can see. Great if fighting a big nation so you can plan ahead on where to send your armies without being surprised by sudden enemy stacks. Infamy Keep it down you go over the limit and even OPMs One province minors will attack you. Oh and some provinces might suddenly get a shit ton of rebellion risk at random if its too high. Trade If youre a warmonger avoid foreign trade cause youre unlikely to do well if youre going for a mostly peaceful game then trade as much as you can! Mercantilism is good for trading only if you own a CoT Center of Trade or several. Free trade is for trading with all foreign CoT though youll do a bit worse in your own ones.

1671676,0,t1_cjplxbj,As was mentioned its the Schengen area which functions as a common border. Its complicated and there are quite a few errors there.On first glance. Croatia Bulgaria Romania are NOT schengen countries though they are EU countries. They are obligated to join though. Of the microstates I believe the Vatican is de jure Schengen and Monaco and San Marino just have open borders with France and Italy respectively making them de facto Schengen members. I dont actually know how it works with Monaco as you can arrive by sea from outside the Schengen Area Gibraltar is missing as there is indeed a border crossing to go from Spain to Gibraltar. Its actually not even in the same border as the UK as you have to cross again to land in the Common Travel Area There should be no border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in this map. Ireland and the UK are NOT in Schengen but do have a similar arrangement between themselves and some of the islands around there UK is king of complicated country relationships. This is called the Common Travel Area that I referenced in the point about Gibraltar. Greenland is not included in Nordic Passport Union or Schengen. Canary Islans are excluded but Spain is shown just thought it was weird since the Balearic Islands are thereNot an error but a quick point that Andorra is correctly listed as separate as it is NOT in Schengen and you have to pass a border crossing to get in there. At both Gibraltar and Andorra it can actually be a pain to get an ExitEntry stamp since they basically let everyone with a rich country passport through without asking. This can be a real issue in Gibraltar which has an airport with flights to the UK as it can leave you in or out of Schengen without the necessary stamp that proves it.,MapPorn,cjpvkgy,2,t5_2si92

It has a major university Oak Ridge National Laboratory nearby and other bigger businesses that bring people in from out of state. Plus cities are naturally more liberal than middle of nowhere rural areas. Knoxville is not nearly as liberal as Memphis and its not even close. Outside of the Mayor and city council politics is dominated by the GOP...and even then Republicans have controlled those in the past as well See Bill Haslam and Victor Ashe. It is represented by a Republican House Member. All of the State Senate spots in the area are held by Republicans. Only two of the areas State House members are Dems Gloria Johnson and Joe Armstrong. In  Romney carried Knox Co.   . If you really want to know how Republican Knox County is look no further than the utter catastrophe our court system just underwent. A couple of longserving wellregarded judges were voted out by two Republicans that never even campaigned. One of them had only been an attorney for three years and never even had tried a case in the court which he now presides over. The reason why he won....the R next to his name.

1969199,0,t1_ckqgui7,sigh. We already do both ways. We have populationheavy states have great power over small states HoR and we have the opposite in the senate. The system was designed exactly so that small states cant overpower big states and vice versa. This is th grade Social Studies. How hard is this to get?Also  going by your line of thinking why would we bother with State governments at all? If the Federal Government is just going to represent the population collectively then why bother with the statelevelpoliticalsubdivision?If we abolished the idea that state governments had separate and equal representation in Washington senate then what purpose would a state serve anymore?  What if the culture of California New York and Florida all became strongly antiabortion while Wyoming is strictly prochoice. Suddenly the decision to allow the state to decide this issue is determined by the majority of an entirely different culture. Guns. A state like Wyoming is spread out wide and hunting plays a big role in their culture and commerce. In NY and CA there is a great deal of urbanization. Is it right to have NY and CA ban guns for the entire nation while a sparselypopulated state that relies on certain weaponry as a part of their commerce suffer? Toxic waste. Do you think that a state like Wyoming would get any sort of a fighting chance in a where do we want to place this? conversation regarding a toxic waste facility? Even if the facility is EPAapproved and safe theres always a what if? Funding things at a point of parity fixed cost. If we govern equally per person this means we would distribute funds this way too. Currently population centers are allowing sparsely populated areas to mooch off of them...however  a place as vast as Wyoming with such a small population...youre simply not going to get the percapita tax revenue to build adequate infrastructure or have any sorts of federally funded public entities to the amount that a more populous state would receive. Yes this is taking more than your fair share but aside from dividing the country up into  equally sized equally populous regions theres not really a way to begin to approach a reasonable solution. ,MapPorn,ckqhmna,2,t5_2si92

Not everyone is all that clued up on politics and they may hold certain prejudices for or against particular parties without necessarily even thinking that much about their policies. Again it would be interesting to see a map with this data.

This is by the way the same tool that OP used to make these maps in the first case. You wont find me defending that google maps uses mercator though.EDIT Heres what the devs of mapFRAPPE has to say gt If you draw the outline at a given latitude in the Reference map and then view the outline at a different latitude in the Comparison map the relative orientation of the marker positions will be distorted. This distortion occurs for two different reasons.gt        First Google Maps uses a Mercator projection for its maps. By design this projection distorts distances at different latitudes. Distances are magnified at higher latitudes.gt Second my calculation of comparison marker positions attempts to preserve true distances between markers. These calculations account for the fact that units of longitude have different lengths depending on latitude. The calculations somewhat reverse Mercator distortions of horizontal distances but not vertical distances.So my map is not entirely correct in that vertical distances are still changed but its more correct than it would have been otherwise. ,MapPorn,cllgi18,3,t5_2si92

Minority groups mostly face issues related to poverty rather than colorethnicityreligionetc and poor people pretty much never get any representation because poor people dont get elected.

2556044,0,t1_cms3t1n,Indeed it is. Mandarin Chinese was under a transitional period and the standard translation was yet to be set which is the major factor of such discrepancy. Thus many of the place names or personal names are somehow transcribed phonetically translated according to translators own mother tongues instead of following a standard way just like what we more or less are doing today. There are still no official rules for transcribing proper nouns into Chinese at all but weve got rather coherent but separate traditions in mainland Hong Kong and Taiwan which means that one proper noun can be transcribed into three different official ways in Chinese if youre unlucky.Clearly many of the proper nouns on the map are transcribed according to Shanghaiese a dialect of Wu language whilst most of the proper nouns today are supposedly transcribed in Mandarin but having lots of Cantonese influences. For example Switzerland Suisse in French being translated as  rweyshuh in Mandarin is clearly due to Cantonese ways of transcription soysee in Cantonese. On this map its transcribed as  Sts in Shanghaiese sounds close enough though but unfortunately it can easily be misunderstood as taxes amp capital if context is not given.,MapPorn,cms7nlo,5,t5_2si92

2913161,0,t3_2tfybc,Sisheng north Republic of China With the close of World War II in  Japan was divided between the four allied powers of the Pacific theatre. The Soviet Union took Hokkaido and the northern half of Honshu. The United States occupied the southern half of Honshu the UK pieces of Honshu and Kyushu and Chiang KaiSheks Republic of China took the whole of Shikoku and jointly occupied Osaka with the UK mostly Australian soldiers and administrators. After the close of the Chinese Civil War which led to a disgraced Chiang Kai Shek taking refuge on Taiwan Chinese soldiers remained on Shikoku  now renamed Sisheng the Chinese translation of Four Provinces the Japanese meaning of Shikoku. Chiang  an American ally  supported the United States activities on Honshu including the blockade of Tokyo and sanctions against the Soviet Union and later the Peoples Republic of Japan North Japan. The Republic of Japan South Japan was formed in  uniting the UK and American spheres of influence Republic of Honshu and Kyushu was rejected because it forwent the Japanese claim to Hokkaido but Chiang went out of his way to ignore the creation and formally annexed Sisheng into the Chinese Republic. The Japanese  their population nearly halved by the end of the war  were discriminated against in many areas of their home islands. The Soviet allied with Ainu tribes and people and sponsored their colonization of Honshu  a great reversal of history that was not without its triumphs and tragedies. The United States and United Kingdom began initiating their own resettlement programs to improve the decimated Japanese infrastructure granting land to Americanborn ethnicJapanese including many members of the nd Infantry veterans of the European theater and later as translators in the latter portion of the Japanese campaign. There was some talk of keeping Americanoccupied Japan on as a protectorate of the United States similar to Hawaiis position at the time but those same Nisei colonists and later Isei colonists who finally returned to their homeland after many decades abroad insisted that Japan should seek selfrule and eventually reunion. Chiang KaiShek had other plans for Sisheng. He took American settlement programs as his precedent but followed Russian policies by gathering Japanese survivors of the Shikoku campaigns and sending them to Osaka. Meanwhile refugees from mainland China of the Civil War were being settled onto Sisheng. Many of them were simply granted rights to Japanese homes an unceremoniously threw out destroyed or burned personal affects left behind by the previous Japanese occupiers. Sisheng somewhat wisely remained a militarycontrolled protectorate until a civilian administrative system was set in place. By  the kinks were mostly worked out on Sisheng and it was a Chinesespeaking province and recognized by most of the world as the northern half of the Chinese Republic. While Sisheng was a success story of recolonization and settlement Osaka became a nightmare. The Japanese who lost their homes were turned into slums which soon became overrun with organized crime and extremist activity. An organization calling themselves Ronins of the Sunset soon developed and began launching attacks on Sisheng based out of Osaka. This led to an international incident between China and the Commonwealth. The Ronins based their operations out of the UK side of Osaka Osaka was administrated separately from the Republic of Japan until  and Commonwealth forces were remiss to conduct operations in the hardtopolice slums. Especially since the gangs that operated in Osaka  Roninallied or otherwise  had no problem killing Australians as they did Chinese. The Republic of Japan came to the rescue beginning collective farm programs in Kyushu the most devastated of the islands Kyushu lost  of its prewar population and eventually extending the program to Honshu. South Japan also initiated their own infrastructure endeavors building railroads and opening schools hospitals and fire departments all across Japan. These programs opened shortterm construction opportunities that many in the Osaka and Tokyo slums jumped at  eager to leave the poverty illnesses violence and drugs. After their construction the government in Kyoto needed teachers doctors engineers and firemen to work the new projects of postwar Japan. Two things were done former construction workers seeking advanced salary and skills were sent abroad to the United States Australia the UK and even Taiwan to learn and many professionals in the previous countries were imported to Japan to teach. Sisheng began similar programs open only to Chinese. Today relations are still strained between the Republic of China and the South Japan though there have been talks between the two in   and one last year to open up Visa regulations between the two. Though business the legal kind is still difficult from Sisheng to Honshu and Kyushu. ,MapPorn,cnz8fsx,14,t5_2si92

2979249,0,t3_2u8j5m,This map confuses me.It says it measures purchasing power index in the key.

This had a big effect on Mussolini who was a socialist from his youth. The figures behind Fascism werent crusty old traditionalists. They were radical often young and modernist in their thinking.

A lot of locals make very little money and couldnt use the park much if they had to pay  every time they wanted to use it.The  a person is probably off BUT remember that operating expenses of the park are only a fraction of the costs.  The Federal government tranqus and tags bison elk wolves and moose outside the park takes blood and tissue samples and then compares those to samples from the local cattle.  Disease spread between domestic and wild herds is a big issue around here and the Feds pay the bill to sort that out.  Predation by wolves that leave the park is also a big issue.  It is the Federal government that has to deal with that problem as well.  The Feds pay researchers and hunters because the animals come from Federal lands if the animals came from state lands the cost would go to the state.  So that brings the annual operating costs a lot higher.So a private party might buy the land wouldnt have to charge  a person my bad there but given the expenses and the fact that unlike the government they would have to cover expenses AND make profit the park would transition from affordable to all American citizens to affordable to all except the poor American citizens.

This however makes the placement of Black Ruthenia problematic.

3176107,0,t3_2wiibz,I think that the redblack distinction is a bit misleading as it lends the viewer to the misconception that national debt and personal debt are similar or morally equivalent.Personal debts are expected to be paid socially and to accrue and maintain a great deal of debt is considered to be bad for people or families.Countries on the other hand are able to manage debt more flexibly than families can owing to the fact that they have massive amounts of resources that can be either sold or rented at a moments notice if they are needed. It is perfectly all right for a country to keep a substantial amount of debt in play as long as it is paying its interest. The people who might essentially buy that debt will be reassured by the fact that they will get their money back when buying from countries like the US.If you take into account that Putins assets are estimated at approximately  billion that he has basically acquired during his rule of Russia along with all the other billionaires who have made money exploiting Russian natural resources consider the mindset of a person looking to lend money to a country and deciding how likely they are to get their money back. As a result of this sort of disparity the US sells debt at extremely low interest rates while Russian interest is higher because you never know when things will go badlydisappear into a rich magnates pockets,MapPorn,cor7arw,2,t5_2si92

Uber drivers are not considerate drivers they dont signal properly they jump into the buffer zones large vehicles build in front of them to stay safe and they are more concerned with reading their phones while driving than doing what they should be doing driving.Those sound like problems associated with all private drivers and thats kind of the point of Uber turning regular private citizens with cars into public transportation. Riding with them is supposed to be similar or the same as riding with a buddy from work or a fellow classmate or simply hitchhiking. You take the exact same risks you mention when you hitchhike ride with a friend or ride with a strangeracquaintance. Failing to signal driving recklessly and textingtalking while driving are already regulated in many places. What regulations beyond simply driving legally do you think Uber drivers should have to be subjected to. More importantly if an individual like me is unconcerned with the guarantee that their vehicle is in top shape and that the person is a trained driver why should I care that they arent trained beyond a regular drivers license?Youve given several reasons why someone shouldnt choose to use Uber but youve given none for Uber drivers to be regulated beyond normal taxation insurance and licensing. ,MapPorn,cozne5g,1,t5_2si92

3298448,0,t1_cp47z8z,Im not sure what you mean by store on board. Hydrogen Fuel Cell cars already store hydrogen on board in a pressurized tank.As for liquid propane and compressed natural gas. Youre right. Hydrogen fuel cells dont offer much more in comparison to internal combustion engines running off of those alternative fuels in terms of range and emissions today at least. People latch on to HFC because it has the illusion of zero emissions since the car itself will put out nothing other than water. Unfortunately the carbon emissions are still there. They were created in the manufacturing and transport of the hydrogen especially if it keeps coming from the gas and oil industry.However hydrogen in theory can be  zero emissions unlike LPG or CNG if it is generated from clean energy powered electrolysis. This process is so inefficient though that an electric car will go x further on the same clean energy source than a hydrogen car. This is why the electric car is the winner over hydrogen LPG and CNG.,MapPorn,cp48zsv,2,t5_2si92

For japan we have questionable statistics since we dont want the numbers too high since it would reflect badly on us.That convenient K and K on the civilian deaths are pure bullshit. Considering that we were actively targeting the japanese civilians in firebombing campaigns for monthsyears it is highly likely those numbers are MUCH higher. And the japanese military deaths are much lower considering that japan always underreported their losses to save face. And round numbers are always suspect. And look at chinas numbers.

3483651,0,t1_cpoycl6,ELI or ELI had high school biology? The version for yearolds is this is where your daddys daddys daddy came from.. Whats the Y chromosome and why is it interesting? Your DNA genetic code is contained in  chromosomes half from your mom and half from your dad. Your mother gives you  autosomal nonsex chromosomes and  X chromosome. Your father gives you  autosomal chromosomes and either  X chromosome if youre female or  Y chromosome if youre male. The Y chromosome is thus always passed from father to son  so a man always shares his with his biological father and grandfather. Unlike the X chromosomes which could basically come from any parent or grandparent. This is interesting because genetics allow us to easily track the direct male line  your paternal grandfathers paternal grandfathers paternal grandfather would have the same Y chromosome as you and so on. So if we find your ancestral tombs we can easily prove you were related. Even more interestingly if we find the body of a prehistoric human frozen in ice we can tell if they have direct male descendants living today.. What are Y chromosome haplogroups? Y chromosomes like all DNA are not copied perfectly  therere occasionally mutations. They occur randomly but at a predictable rate over time. So if we compare two random men today we can find out how long ago their most recent common ancestor lived. Today their Y chromosomes are very different genetically but they both evolved from the same one hundreds of thousands of years ago. So it is for all of us. Haplogroups are the basic groupings of different Y chromosome mutations. As human populations split during early migrations everyone with certain mutations ended up in their own part of the world. Later on there was a lot of mixing but the basic distribution hadnt changed at least until industrialization. So your Y chromosome haplogroup is your closest maleline relatives.. What are Y chromosome haplogroups NOT? Your closest genetic relatives. This is about just  chromosome out of . If just one female partner of one of your direct male ancestors had an affair with a foreigner every single person in the male line thereafter will have the foreign Y chromosome. But most of your genetic code will still typically come from locals because its hard to fake ones female ancestry  someone had to have seen your mom pregnant with you. Your Y chromosome will show you as a foreigner in your land while your overall genes will not. On the other hand if your ancestors took wives from the neighboring land as a custom for many generations your overall genes will be closest to the neighboring land while your Y chromosome will show you as a local.. What does this map show? The dominant groupings of mutation types of the Y chromosome which are interesting because they suggest historical and prehistorical trends in migration and reproduction at least when it comes to men. For example the Es the Is and the Ns belong to the ancient inhabitants of EuropeMediterranean before the IndoEuropean invasionmigration from k years ago that dominates the continent today. The Rs are the IndoEuropeans  theyre also dominant in Iran and India. The Rs are further split into the Western and Eastern branches.,MapPorn,cppd0r8,10,t5_2si92

3639461,0,t1_cq7129w,gt The other time that the Union could have had a giant victory Adding onto this there was actually two other time the Union could have delivered a devastating blows in the east. Both during the Gettysburg Campaign one fairly obscure and the other overshadowed by the Battle of Gettysburg itself. In June  with Lee clearly focused in Northern Virginia the Union began to concentrate troops on the Yorktown peninsula with the goal of threatening Richmond. A force of  troops was assembled within weeks. They werent elite troops by any means and included large numbers of raw temporary recruits and were commanded by General Dix a rather aged War of  vet who was better at organizing and governing occupied territories than leading in the field. They were however opposed only by piecemeal confederate defenses made largely of similarly second rate soldiers and barely  in number if that including militia and convalescents.When it became clear Lee was headed into the North orders came for this force to move against Richmond. Dix however bungled it majorly committing only part of his force and allowing the generals he did commit to dawdle. A good commander would have easily rooted the meager defenders and taken Richmond and there would have been nothing the Confederacy could have done to stop it. The second overshadowed one is similar to the aftermath of Antietam. With news of the victory at Gettysburg Lincoln has ordered Meade to pursue the Army of Northern Virginia. The AoNV is devastated having taken substantial casualties  miles of ambulance wagons follow the Army in its defeat its troops are demoralized hungary hot and wet low on ammunition and exhausted from a forced march back to the Potomac river. When they get there they find the pontoon bridge had been burnt several days earlier by an enterprising cavalry raid and the normally calm Potomac is raging from recent rain and unable to be forded safely the Confederates literally drowned thousands of captured livestock trying to get them across.The Army of the Potomac on the other hand has been substantially reinforced with  troops from the garrison at Harpers Ferry that were held in reserve during the actual battle  called up from defending West Virginia and the BampO railroad as well as  militia called into service to defend against the invasion. All those troops from the Virginia Peninsula are also boarding steamships and will arrive within two weeks. It was in pretty good shape all things considered and even most of its veteran VI Corps the largest in the Army hadnt even been engaged in the Battle of Gettysburg.The next week after the battle was nonstop cavalry skirmishes as Meade harassed the retreat little came of it however and Lee was able to establish a defensive position to wait until the river receded enough to safely cross. Meade probed Lees defenses a few times but never found the courage to commit to a fullscale battle. The Army of Northern Virginia was finally able to escape across the river by midmonth. Meade would later blame the mud and depleted state of his army but Lincoln firmly believed he should have destroyed Lee enough that after two more ineffective campaigns in the Fall he more or less replaced Meade with Grant. Meades point about the mud is somewhat valid it was difficult to fight and maneuver on soft ground however Lincoln is right as well if it were possible to destroy an opposing army using Civil War tactics the aftermath of Gettysburg presented the best opportunity.,MapPorn,cq74jko,9,t5_2si92

3717436,0,t1_cqdb92f,gt I can inform you that w was used quite widely in Swedish until one of the latest spelling reforms early th century IIRC. Not that it really matters but still.Thats good to know actually. I didnt know it was used at all outside English and Central Europe. gt On a side note Id like to know how you define loan words  in a lot of languages such as Swedish a huge part of the vocabulary was originates from loan words in this case mostly from Dutch German French and English. Most of these words have been in the language for so long that they dont feel foreign or borrowed at all.gt See the thing is you marked Swedish as only using c in the combination ck. This holds true for the truly native words as far as I can figure out. However it is very widely used in words that originate from Latin e.g. cykel  bike or cycle central cirka cirkel acceleration etc. Compare this to German and Norwegian where the c in such words is usually substituted for a z or an s respectively centrum becomes Zentrum or sentrum. Do words like these really qualify as loan words in the sense that we only used c this way in loan words?Well... its hard for me to get around the fact that I dont speak the vast majority of these languages. You do have a point but I would add that German does occasionally keep the c in Latin words such as circa. For that matter Spanish which I am familiar with only uses k for loan words but also for kilmetros. I felt that if using a c was very rare and only in certain cases e.g. loan words science words Latin and Greek it demonstrates the character of the language to show this. Otherwise you could argue that almost all of these languages use all  English letters even when they only pop up in words like sandwiches. I mostly used Wikipedia articles on languages for my sources which for Swedish simply says that c is in loanwords. ,MapPorn,cqg0iqr,2,t5_2si92

3748362,0,t1_cqjiyxy,The area that Koreans generally claim fall under Gojoseon and later territories isnt really that large. Outer Manchuria and the outer regions of Northeast China were still out of reach. Those maps where Korea is depicted as controlling all of Chinas east coast have no legitimacy in Korea save for a few crazies.Id like to see your sources on the artifacts but regardless I think thats a flawed argument. Naturally artifacts would be found the most in population centers not in the frontier. No sane Korean would claim that Koreans heavily populated Manchuria as the most populous regions were in the Northern parts of the peninsula particularly Pyongyang and the extreme south of Northeastern China such as the Liaodong Peninsula. So you could say that much of Northeastern China didnt have much influence from the Koreans because it generally wasnt a very good place to live. Im not disagreeing with that.I also dont deny the presence of other tribes. Kingdoms like the BalhaeBohai might have had a Korean ruling class but were mostly populated by non Koreans a fact that many Koreans also agree with Chinese people on. Korean kingdoms would alternate between periods of wars with these tribes trade or even opening its doors.I never understand why so many Chinese people think that Koreans  are trying to claim everything Chinese or are a threat to Chinese history. The people you mention are called gukbbong or ultra nationalists here and virtually nobody believes what they saynobody here believes Confucius was Korean either. There is a belief that we might be related to the Manchus genetically but we do not claim them as Koreans or having descended from Koreans in general. In fact even if people claim that we are related the theory is that we were the lucky bunch that got to the fertile peninsula first while the others had to stay in the harsher Manchuria region.,MapPorn,cqjje4v,1,t5_2si92

Thats the entire point of the Milosevicstaged coups from  onwards  to topple governments in Vojvodina and Kosovo and Montenegro but thats a Republic and install leaders who would follow proSerb agenda. Because SR Serbia did not have any power to do so on its own.You have no clue what you are talking about do you?Vojvodina and controversially Kosovo still have rights they had in .Only Yugoslavia SFRY could abolish autonomy of these provinces with constitutionbut because of her collapse the right passed to Serbia.,MapPorn,cqtt2bc,0,t5_2si92

Older people who have lived most of their life under a specific system are less likely to be in favor of changing it and so prefer to preserve the status quo and are also less likely to support more taxes after acquiring more to be taxed. Theres more to it than that of course like how younger people are also less likely to in favor of war and older people tend to be more religious.The system only works if everyone votes in their best interest though things like gerrymandering voter turnout and corporate funding of politics tend to skew the results.,MapPorn,cr3cwe3,9,t5_2si92

The energetic particles from the sun would cling to upper atmosphere particles the ones we like and carry them off into space never to be seen again. If our core were to cool down as we believe it will in the very distant future ie billions of years this would weaken the magnetic field eventually to practically nothing. This isnt something that happens suddenly or without warning so were not too concerned about it.

That ensures that even people who think meh at least get a very easy way to vote instead of having to register somewhere first and then on the day itself also make their way to the polling station.

The Chinese invasion of Vietnam was triggered by the Vietnamese occupation of Chineseallied Cambodia. The primary goal was to return Cambodia to the Chinese sphere. They failed.As with the French in the s the Vietnamese army avoided committing itself to combat despite several Chinese attempts to lure the VPA into a pitched battle they were only able to engage irregular units and militia forces. Realizing that they were walking into the same type of war that had humiliated the French and the Americans China just declared that what it had done was exactly what it wanted to do and turned around and went back home. They invaded because Vietnam was occupying Cambodia. At the end of the war Cambodia remained in Vietnamese hands. They invaded because they wanted to prove their dominance over the Vietnamese military. They didnt even find them. So whats the victoryto take half a waterfall and show the USSR something that it already knew fully well the Soviets didnt even mobilize along the border and barely bothered to offer material aid. If that was Chinas intent then the game wasnt worth the candle and the Chinese were fools for spending millions and losing tens of thousands of men for such an inconsequential prize.

Also later when Russia was closing in it was a fight to save their country. Many men died fighting hard not to win because victory wasnt a possibility at that point but to stall the Russians and buy more time for people to flee to other allied lines in the west. They should honor those soldiers because if it wasnt for them all or most of Germany would have been east Germany.

4175611,1,t1_crvx3lf,I find it infuriating the extent to which we put up with Confederate mythologizing and aggrandizing in this country.  At base the Confederates committed treason against the republic in order to ensure the continuationand expansionof slavery there were other issues also but thats at the core.  The Southern elite convinced hundreds of thousands of poor farmers and tradesmen most of whom benefited relatively little from this peculiar institution to lay down their lives for it.  Confederate units slaughtered black troops in violation of the codes and laws of war of the day a small but I fear representative sample.  Although all POW camps during the war had abysmal conditions Andersonville stands out in its infamy and ignominy.  And so on  brutal acts carried out in the name of a brutal ideology that perpetuated a brutal system.I am all for people wishing to mourn their war dead who fought through true horrors and fought bravely and with dignity and in the vast majority of cases also fought honorablyor at least as honorably as any soldiers in any war.  But to honor them is for me going too far because it confers legitimacy however slight on the cause for which they fought.   ,MapPorn,crw853d,6,t5_2si92

Same thing for Australia and Gulf countries.

Decreasing Y more element per person just to name one example. That is what I was driving at.gtIf the state offered people a paycheck of  a year for each child they had and offered free health care education and child care then there would be every reason to have as many children as possible. Again bad math. Assuming this worked how you think it does If everyone did this who is going to pay for it? Everyone would just be paying it to themselves.It also ignores that money is by itself not a dominating factor at least not in the k range. I would think one major issue is the time commitment involved during the part of an adults life when they are focusing on their career and the difficulty in juggling the two unless there is a stayathome parent. And the state cant reimburse you for time.gtBirth rate stuffReligiosity is part of it but again this is a complex topic. If there was a silver bullet countries like Japan would have already implemented it. There have also been disastrous social consequences in trying to artificially force an increase in the birth rate.gtPristine worldI dont subscribe to a pristine world BTW. If I did I would either be advocating everyone commit suicide or Id be living in some hut and living some huntergatherer lifestyle.I would just ideally like enough of it to be left alone or set aside so that biodiversity is not threatened and so that impact from human activity can be localized and not have nearly the same global consequences. This is so that the biosphere can indefinitely continue to support us and have the resilience to bounce back from unexpected events that are not in our control.gtHonestly I dont see any reason why we cant have buffer space and less environmental impact while having a population of double that.In theory yes you could.

The Ordovician the Permian and the Cretaceous all had the vast majority of species die off without human aid and life continued.

4611944,0,t1_ctbtjl9,No... but there have been many instances of migration and forced emigration throughout European history.  Just some th century examples include the Germans after WW.  Hitler had used that as a pretext to invade several countries though.  What about after WW where German populations from the fall of the AustrianHungarian Empire fell?  While the Austrian hegemony wasnt the best it really wasnt brutal.  Or what about Russia who relocated millions of ethnicities and classes while killing millions in the process.  The ethnic cleansing in the Balkans also comes to mind.Its not a particularly rare or uncommon historical event.  Especially in matters of conquest and colonization.  If you throw in Europes interactions with other continents these policies become particularly vivid. The British as an example we able to control such a huge empire particularly for their deft use of dividing people to maintain control.  Even when mass movements of people were not directly andor immediately caused by these policies it would be difficult to remove blame from them entirely for issues like ethnic cleansing and mass migration in IndiaPakistan.  This also isnt really a European thing either.  Historically you can find numerous examples from every region of the world.  Even the Native Americans themselves would do it. Go read up on the Beaver Wars for example.  Im going to quote wiki on this but feel free to find your own sourcegtThe Iroquois attacked the Neutral Nation in . By the end of  they had completely driven the tribe from traditional territory killing or assimilating thousands. At the time the Neutrals inhabited a territory ranging from the presentday Niagara Peninsula westward to the Grand River valley....gtThe French called the people Neutral French la Nation neutre because they tried to remain neutral between the warring Huron and nations of the Iroquois Confederacy. The Neutral territory contained flint grounds near the eastern end of Lake Erie. This important resource was used to make spearheads and arrowheads and its importance gave the Neutral power to maintain their neutrality. Once the neighboring countries began receiving firearms through trade with the Europeans however the possession of the flint grounds served as no advantage.Really isnt a European thing just a human thing.,MapPorn,ctbx0tr,11,t5_2si92

4753002,0,t1_cttki9b,I just read the critiques thanks for linking them and they have very good points. For one there really was an oversimplification of the diseases in regards to their origin within the Old World. However I dont think he did make any disingenuous claims as to his knowledge of pathology and the book itself is rife with references to back up some of his claims on other topics. I dont think he did do this as recklessly as couldve been possible with such a mainstream publication.However I think the reason some people have such a vested interest in critiquing it links notwithstanding is because they believe that Jared Diamond and people who enjoy his work use it to infer that white Europeans are the superior people.I think his books serve to prove the exact opposite people no matter the race or creed have their civilizational development effected by their surroundings and some by miraculous chance. The colour of their skin and the microscopic differences in physical traits have no bearing on the content of their characters. Rather than refuting any such physical or cognitive explanations for why as an example the British Empire or the Chinese Dynasties enjoyed a higher level of consolidation within its borders this book shows answers are more complicated than prejudiced beliefs. This is mostly done by framing the book itself as a large hypothesis and as a layman I particularly enjoyed it.,MapPorn,cttnt96,0,t5_2si92

Western meals generally get a fusion twist to them.

So any author of a ethnic map has very real motivations for underrepresenting or overrepresenting certain ethnicities as a way of suggesting boundaries of nationstates.A great example is in the end of the th and beginning of the th centuries when the fairly new nationstates of Bulgaria Greece and Serbia were all very interested in the future of the still Ottoman ruled area of Macedonia. The Macedonian Question was incredibly hotly contested and you had propaganda from each state including ethnic maps that laid claim to expanses of land. But through creative manipulations of what exactly constituted a Greek or Bulgarian the ethnic maps are vastly different depending on who was drawing it. Many people in Macedonia would have been able to speak multiple languages so the linguistic basis of ethnicity quickly breaks down. Ethnic maps especially in the heyday of nationalism in Europe are horribly unreliable.Edit Here are some examples terrible resolution but it gets the point across.

5049176,0,t1_cuuiupu,Yeah essentially France has a much older history of a centralized rulegovernment even before the French revolution and its ideas of one Republic indivisible and public education much earlier than Spain or other countries like Italy and thus it standardized the French language and killed off dialects and other languages much earlier than its neighbors. Today though I dont think France is oppressive to regional languages at all despite what people like to believe. The situation today is that the harm was done and now its kind of hard to revive practically dead dialectslanguages unless it comes from the will of the people themselves. This will may exist to an extent for languages which have a more distinct clearcut identity like Breton Corsican and Basque but for the others FrenchRomance or Germanic languagesdialects found in France the people themselves just dont seem to care enough to maintain their existence. Basically the sad truth is that regional languages were successfully sidelined way back in the th century.Sure France doesnt recognize regional languages as official but many areas do have bilingual signs in public areas and you can learn the languages in school. But now its basically just folkloric sadly. In my public school in Paris I could have taken Breton language classes.,MapPorn,cuum7wk,8,t5_2si92

And to be extra fair the map doesnt actually depict Trianon whatever its intent. Burgenland was lost as a result of the aforementioned SaintGermain and Sopron was returned following a plebiscite in .So the map manages to show both more than it explicitly claims the results of the Treaty of Trianon and less than it implicitly wants Hungarys territorial losses after World War I and the beneficiaries of said losses.

At least Ostpreuen and a large section of Pommern. FrankfurtOder is still part of the reunified Federal Germany. With the river Oder as the border to Poland. Nevertheless It would be interessting to see how high the percentages has been in the towns in comparison to the countryside. At least for the region WeserEms in which Ive grown up. There is still a stigma to its former capital city Oldenburg which has been the first city in whole Germany in which the NSDAP could score the absolute majority during the  elections of this federal state.In contrast to that the southern areas of the Region WeserEms is dominantly of Catholic stance. That might explain why the overall score for the NSDAP in this subsequent election the year thereafter is weaker than the poll of  ? Actually I already found these numbers. But only in German language. Federal election of  in which the NSDAP scored   in the city of Oldenburg. During the Reichstagswahl nationwide  they scored For the whole region WeserEms the map only states .Anyway. The problem the NSDAP hat to attract Catholics is still valid. At least you can read this from the election map as the region Westfalen as well as OberbayernSchwaben and Niederbayern have weak results for the NSDAP.

Going forward I see the influence as largely economic for all of its problems the Russian economy dwarfs anything than the Caucasus can ever aspire to have.But thats also the same reason they are cultivating ties with Europe Turkey Iran and other neighbors Georgia because of the Russian embargo Armenia because of its landlocked status and Azerbaijan in order to ship its oil to European markets.gtGeorgia if it ever wants to be reunited with its rebel parts can never join the EU or NATO and besides that neither organization is ever going to expand in that direction knowing the huge diplomatic strain it will put between Russia and the EU.This is true in the sense of becoming a full member.

5854573,0,t1_cxn19q7,Not really during the Fleet Problems from  to  carriers were used for strike and power projection.Fleet Problem I was held in February and March  and was staged off the coast of Panama. The attacking Black force using battleships to represent aircraft carriers tested the defenses of the Panama Canal. A single plane launched from Oklahomarepresenting a carrier air groupdropped  miniature bombs and theoretically destroyed the spillway of the Gatun Dam.Fleet Problem V was held in March and April  and simulated an attack on Hawaii. The Black force the aggressor was given the United States first aircraft carrier Langley along with two seaplane tenders and other ships outfitted with aircraft while the defending Blue force had no carriers. In addition aircraft aboard the battleship Wyoming could not be launched for lack of a working catapult. Langleys positive performance helped speed the completion of aircraft carriers Lexington and Saratoga.Fleet Problem VII was held March  and involved defense of the Panama Canal. The highlight of the exercise was Langleys successful air raid on the Panama Canal.Fleet Problem IX in January  studied the effects of an attack upon the Panama Canal and conducted the operations necessary to carry out such an eventuality and pitted the Battle Fleet less submarines and Lexington against a combination of forces including the Scouting Force augmented by Lexington the Control Forces Train Squadron  and th Naval District and local army defense forces. In a daring move Saratoga was detached from the fleet with only a single cruiser as escort to make a wide sweep to the south and attack the Panama Canal which was defended by the Scouting Fleet and Saratogas sister ship Lexington. She successfully launched her strike on  January and despite being sunk three times later in the day proved the versatility of a carrierbased fast task force.Fleet Problem X was held in  in Caribbean waters. This time however Saratoga and Langley were disabled by a surprise attack from Lexington showing how quickly air power could swing the balance in a naval action.Etc...The repeated nature and growing complexity of the Fleet Problem exercises show that from  on the US Navy saw carriers as the centerpiece of strategic and tactical strike for the US Navy. Cruisers and battleships had their places to defend the carriers and transports but the scouting and daylight strike could be carried out by the carriers.,MapPorn,cxn29wy,19,t5_2si92

We can all oppose them.Natural gas  greenhouses gases too but its not as bad. Probably a good bridge to fully clean energy and works well in tandem with solar and wind as a backup source. Environmentalists still piss and moan about it. Partly understandable but we have to be realistic here.Nuclear  RADIATION SCARY! NO NUKES!Wind  nope cant build wind turbines it kills birds!Solar  someone wants to build a big  renewable zeroemission solar plant in the Mojave Desert? Nope its bad for the tortoises! No solar!Hydro  floods shit and isnt good for the fish! No hydro!Tidal  impacts sensitive coastal ecosystems! No tidal!Well environmentalists how the fuck do you want us to generate electricity? Or do you just want us to return to subsistence agriculture in a preindustrial world? But then youd throw a tantrum because people are cutting down trees for their fireplaces.I guess maybe I should clarify. My problem isnt really with environmentalists the people.

6277691,0,t1_cz35osw,Im not sure how your point still stands only those very unfamiliar with the Bible think that it teaches the love of money is in fact the root of all evil.As far as pride being the root of the other six you are of course correct that its part of Catholic dogma or at least part of their church teaching. Im not sure what level of officiality it has I bet its probably closer to a teaching tool rather than a formalized tradition and its certainly not on part with an edict. Keep in mind the  deadly sins are not from the Bible. They are part of Catholic church thinking as developed by several different church fathers and the list of sins changed in meaning and thrust as the ideas developed. For example what was once the sin of sadness has become envy. The idea behind that one which is lost in the modern understanding of the list is that you are sad at someone else good fortune. Envy doesnt want someone elses good things for their own envy simply wants the other person not to have it and often takes pleasure when those good things are lost. Schadenfreude is the better understood expression of envy in modern times.In the development of catholic thinking they were essentially used as a bug list for humanity. Church fathers argued that they held to be true in experience and had support in the Bible and other church teaching. Pride was considered the root sin to which all the other sins added nuance and distinction.Traditionally most arrangements give pride the top position often followed by sloth another one that has lost its full meaning in the modern understanding of the .Many protestants would also agree that given a broad definition of pride that pride is also the root of all sin and that idea has some biblical support. If Pride is elevation of self instead of submission to God then it is an underlying factor in everything that orthodox christians define as sinful.In conclusion the  deadly sins have changed a lot over time and arent actually directly from the Bible.,MapPorn,cz37b2k,3,t5_2si92

6340292,0,t1_cza5617,According to Cornell Lab of Ornithologygt  American Crows can be considered partially migratory. That is some populations migrate others are resident and in others only some of the crows migrate. Crows in the southern parts of their range appear to be resident and not migrate. They may make some changes in their use of space at this time spending more time off the territory to forage and roost. Crows migrate out of the northern most parts of their range. It has been stated that crows migrate out of those areas where the minimum January temperature averages   F. Certainly crows leave the northern Great Plains in the fall leaving Saskatchewan and Alberta to winter in the lower Plains states of Nebraska Kansas and Oklahoma Kalmbach E. R. and S. E. Aldous. . Winter banding of Oklahoma crows. Wilson Bull.  . Crows can be seen crossing the Great Lakes in spring and fall and these birds undoubtedly are migrating to and from parts of Canada.gt Crows breeding in upstate New York are partially migratory. Breeding birds and most of the tagged individuals in my study appear to remain all winter. The breeding pair appears to visit their breeding territory every day of the year although they will roost and forage in other places. Nonbreeders may spend significant periods on the home territory or may spend time away. Many individuals wander around the local area joining different foraging flocks on subsequent days. They may or may not visit the home territory during this time. Other nonbreeders leave the area entirely for several months. Several of the birds I have tagged in Ithaca NY have been recovered shot or seen in Pennsylvania during the winter. One individual less than one year old was seen at a compost pile in northern Pennsylvania with a flock of crows and three weeks later it was back in Ithaca with its parents who were starting nesting. It helped the parents raise young that year and remained in the area over subsequent winters.,MapPorn,czabk3f,2,t5_2si92

6357525,0,t1_czc4e5j,You do realize that Hezbollah has its own political wing in Lebanons parliament right? Yes they do have their own foreign policy but for that same reason I would not say that Colombia or Mexico are not democracies even though large parts of their states are in the hands of nonstate actors. When Hezbollah wanted to protest the government they setup camps outside parliament in Beirut. When Hezbollah wanted to bring down the PM they had to make political maneuverings and alliances within parliament to make it happen. They are a very powerful and organized interest group. And yet they have to play by the institutional democratic rules in Lebanon. Again what am I arguing? Lebanon should not be lumped with other countries listed there as an autocracy OR limited democracy. Yes the power of the state in enforcing itself is limited at times however this has nothing to do with infringement on constitutional rights a completely separate matter. Hong Kong is NOT a limited democracy because of the PLA barracks and naval base it hosts its a limited democracy because only half its legislature is popularly elected. ,MapPorn,czca3ur,2,t5_2si92

6429181,0,t1_czk3aje,When immigrant populations enter the US and congregate in New York City they tend to do so in neighborhoods where their fellow countrymen have moved.  Its like a cultural half way house.  familiar customs from the old country make the st generation comfortable with stores and shops that are similar to home.  Then a generation or  later tends to move out to the suburbs and when families move they move to where other people from the old neighborhood have gone.  years ago we had Italian Irish German and Polish neighborhoods as those families moved from Brooklyn and Queens out to Long Island.  but now you have the same thing happening but with different cultures.  Hence Great Neck is now very Persian and Hicksville is very Indian.Back a number of years ago there where covenants and restrictions placed on property that would forbid the sale of said land to various groups like blacks Italians Irish or Jews but despite those restrictions running with the land they are now ignored.Also an important factor is money.  you can buy a house in Hempstead for k with ky in taxes or you can buy a similar house down the block on the other side of the Garden City Line for k with ky in taxes.  Also worth noting is that LI has very few places with multi family residential buildings.,MapPorn,czkbd2o,1,t5_2si92

This could be what the grandparent was referring to. Thats really really big. Many U.S. cities do not include that much of their surrounding metro. San Francisco is  sq miles. St. Louis is  sq mi. Chicago is  sq mi. That doesnt mean those regions end at those borders. It just means that those cities as defined by those borders dont include an awful lot of the people who live there.

Among elected officials lobbying and unrestricted campaign financing means you dont need to actually bribe someone to support your position you just need to find people who believe what you believe and throw enough money at their campaign to get elected or find people who dont care but like getting reelected. If youre a bureaucrat your goal is to buddy up with the private sector to secure a cushy job. Thats more reliable and less illegal than taking envelopes full of money. Plus weve already outsourced a bunch of functions to private contractors who probably arent going to be implicated as public officials.Throw on top of that our obsession with government waste and fraud which means anybody dumb enough to engage in straightforward corruption is likely to get caught. The most recent highprofile case I can think of Virginia governor Bob McDonnells conviction for accepting bribes was over a pathetic . Compare that to the case in China of Bo Xilai who held a position similar to a governor and was convicted for taking . million in bribes. That amount was considered so surprisingly small by the Chinese public that people took it as evidence that Bo Xilai was really only being convicted for being a political rival to President Xi Jinping which he was.

Balkan wars caused a huge influx of refugees with some estimates putting it in the million range. Basically it was three fold remove a minority that had the potential to rebelwork with non ottoman forces prevent any claims on land to avoid a repeat of the Balkan wars and huge ethnic cleansing Balkans were a lot more Muslim before ethnic cleansingmassacresgenocide and also get land to settle these refugees on. Obviously its simplified but thats the basic cause. Not really a plan to kill off all non Muslims as often portrayed because they did not touch Jews or Arab Christians. Just areas where they thought they could be used to claim land. It was triggered after a loss by the ottomans against Russia where they turned their focus against Armenians since Russia would start to be able to push into Anatolia. It stopped with the fall of the ottoman regime. The populations that were not affected mainly Greeks along the west coast were later exchangedfled as part of a mutual population Exchange.

There are dozens of places within a few hours drive from me where Roman remains can be seen and Im at one of the furthest extremities of the former empire.The Holy Roman Empire was a Medieval feudatory state which evolved into a loose confederation of smaller statelets centred around modern Germany.

Germany would have had nothing and would have needed to build up a navy capable of completely overpowering the US navy. Having the nukes wouldnt have been that offensively useful against the US  they couldnt reach North America to use them!While its difficult I can imagine scenarios where Germany could have largely defeated the USSR ultimately the German military made a lot of unnecessary mistakes but the ensuing occupation would have been pretty devastatingly taxing for them. Even just occupying everything up until Moscow is a lot of territory and a lot of civilians all while defending against partisans seeking to overthrow them.Its strange to imagine what a postWW Europe might have looked like if it was far more devastated but also never had to deal with an Iron Curtain. ,MapPorn,d3b0sfo,2,t5_2si92

The New Testament in the Bible is all about love and freedom. Theres a verse that says it is for freedom Christ has set us free. The point of the NT is basically that we humans are free to do what we want but there is a good way to act towards people and a bad way to act towards people.

In fact most of the CentralNorthern Italian states at the time of Unification were duchies Modena Tuscany Parma parts of the Papal States. While there does seem to be some correlation between earlier republican forms of government particularly in Florence Venice and Genoa some outliers do exist. Aosta once the heart of the domain of the Savoyard countsdukeskings is fairly firmly republican as are many of the former ducal states in Northern Italy. Amalfi once an influential maritime republic that dominated trade when Venice was in its infancy as a Byzantine backwater is in one of the most firmly monarchist regions of Italy.

Its a separate argument from whether the brexit referendum was conducted in a fair way. How is that a separate argument? You either think a simple majority is enough representation to pass a major referendum or you dont. gtBut i want to point out that leaving a Voluntary consortium of sovereign states is a lot different than a region with devolved powers leaving a unitary centralized stateNorthern Ireland and the rest of Ireland was conquered by England and annexed against their will through violent repression. Why would you need a larger majority to quit an organization that you were forced to join against your will than you need to quit an organization you voluntarily joined?gtOne is about the justifications for wanting to take steps to have their political unit leave another political unit People in x place disagree with Y decision so they should be able to leave Z countryThats the basis of almost every political breakup. Thats the US quit the British Empire in  and why the UK quit the EU in . What is your alternative justification for a political breakup?gtone is about the proper way to decide whether a political unit leaves not a simple majority referendumYou also havent given an alternative for this. Is there some specific number that is fair like  or .? The reason we tend to use  is because there isnt any other number that seems more fair.

I guess thats the definition of an impasse.Not just that I actually am a person who is comfortable with gun confiscation and abolishing the nd amendment. But I also know that I am part of a small minority. What the NRA has done is convinced its people that any form of gun safety law universal background checks closing the gunshow loophole licensing requirements etc. Laws that would make gun ownership safer and wouldnt reduce a persons ability to own an arsenal are all somehow now a backdoor method of abolishing the nd amendment.gtAgain the NRA only has  million paid members they are a minority in the lobbying business so dont pretend its like they are the mob bosses of the s on capital hill. If the left and the media quit giving the NRA the spotlight the left would win.Youre ignoring the machinations on capitol hill. The fact that the NRA has so convinced its membership of an impending gun confiscation means that any gun safety law brought before congress results in congresspeople getting thousands of calls from NRA members demanding a no vote meanwhile the majority of Americans that support such laws dont call to demand a yes vote because guns arent a priority to them. NRA voters are more driven about guns than any other issue an NRA endorsement can make or break a Republicans house primary bid or a Democratfromaredswingdistricts general election run. And everyone on capital hill knows this which creates inertia against even voting on new measures.The NRA isnt powerful because it gives out a lot of money its powerful because it has an actual grassroots constituency that it can marshall in favour or against any candidate it targets. ,MapPorn,d4xq6to,2,t5_2si92

Take Freak Street for exampleFreak Street was the epicenter during the Hippie trail from the early s to late s. During that time the main attraction drawing tourists to Freak Street was the governmentrun hashish shops. Hippies from different parts of the world traveled to Freak Street Basantapur in search of legal cannabis. Direct bus services to Freak Street were also available from the airport and borders targeting the hippies looking for legal smokes. Freak Street was a hippie nirvana since marijuana and hashish were legal and sold openly in government licensed shops. A young restless population in the west seeking to distant itself from political and social frustration had firsthand contact with the fascinating culture art and architecture and unique life style that attracted hippies to Freak Street. But in the early s the government of Nepal started a roundup of hippies on Freak Street and they were physically deported to India an action propelled largely by a directive from the government of United States of America. The government imposed a strict regulation for tourist regarding the dress codes and physical appearances. After imposing such regulations by government the hippies felt vulnerable and the hippie movement of Nepal died out in the late s.

8825666,0,t1_d74hbie,That is definitely true  any northern migration if it happened would have happened centuries before the establishment of the Second Bulgarian Empire.  I should have added that the northsouth of the Danube question was often driven by nationalism.  in the late th and early th century it was common for Hungarian historians to identify a southern origin and for Romanian historians to identify a northern origin due to their claims to Transylvania.  To Hungarians a southern origin implied that Romanians were late comers to a Hungarian region while the Romanians a northern origin implied they were direct descendants of the Dacians.That being said by the time of the founding of the Second Bulgarian Empire  it seems almost assured that there was a Romance speaking population on both sides of the Danube.  Personally and I am just a guy with an interest in history I find the Moesia argument more compelling simply since the region was under Roman influence for a much longer period than Dacia but that certainly doesnt make it so!,MapPorn,d78q1b6,1,t5_2si92

What is true is that in Germany you can get a well paid job that garners professional respect offers security and requires you to use your brain without having to tick the box of going to a university before having access to the career path as is the case in many other nations. What isnt true is that Germany only focuses on practical skills and for those professions that do require university then you wont be short of ludicrously impractical requirements. Want to be a PE teacher? Better study maths and a foreign language in fact every university course requires this even if you want to study art. Want to be a doctor? Better have a few years of Latin.

Since we didnt had written form and they did since they Christianized way back we didnt want to even if we could to force them to change language they speak. The late XV century wars with Grand Principality of Muscovy led to being far more reliable to Poles than ever to the point we were forced to make Union with Poland or be occupied by foreign power. Since Polish nobles had far more prestige and let alone rights Lithuanian nobles same as Ruthenians would soon adopt Polish language and culture to be considered part of Polish nobility so they could become part of Szlachta.

To say nothing of the fact that this was the precious window during which the U.S. had nuclear capabilities and the USSR didnt. Theres a reason the USSR was contained during this era.

The land south of the Heart River eastwest river north of Grant was at one time granted to the Sioux by a treaty Ft Laramie . A later treaty Ft Laramie  doesnt mention this land and puts the northern border of the reservation at N the border between ND and SD. Then a whole bunch of wars happened and almost all of the territory most notably the goldrich Black Hills was taken from the native peoples. In  the Sioux won a case against the US in the US Supreme Court that said the Black Hills area was wrongly taken from them and it should have been Sioux territory and were awarded . million market value in  plus interest at  as compensation but refused to return the land itself. The Sioux have refused to accept the award as it would terminate any claim they have to the land. The area between the current borders of the reservation and the  borders is often shaded and labeled Unceded  Territory in many of the maps showing the DAPL route but it is not currently recognized in any capacity as native land nor have any courts ruled on it. ,MapPorn,da1jwo7,17,t5_2si92

9649054,0,t1_da2fan2,gt the ottoman census is widely agreed to have undercounted ArmeniansCorrect but thats because the Ottoman Census undercounted everyone. Census and population data was generally done as a means to taxation and resulted in many not just Armenians trying to avoid being counted. Theres also the fact that Ottoman officials often only counted the males of a household omitting womenchildren or assigning a general family number for every home. If you want an example the Armenian Church in the Ottoman Empire compiled their own tabulations of the population at about the same time as the census. They attempted to use more complete records and though they were almost certainly more favorable to the Armenians their results are illustrative of my above point. In the Van Vilayet the most Armenian part of Anatolia the Church counted  Armenians compared to the  number from the Ottomans. But they also counted  Muslims compared to  number from the Ottomans. So yes across the Ottoman Empire the raw number of Armenians counted in official census was depressed. But it was depressed for every group and even taking the most favorable sources for Armenians at face value Armenian Church there was no significant difference in the relative percentage of Armenians when adjusting for undercounting. ,MapPorn,da2g22n,8,t5_2si92

They claim  Luftwaffe aircraft  Ps are lost and  is damaged beyond repair casualties are  MIAThe gallon metal drop tank was introduced in late August . Work was completed on PCRE and CRE that were already in service to retrofit them with a belly shackle and allow them to carry the extra tank the CRE already had this ability. In late  the PDRE became available with wing pylons it could hypothetically carry up to three tanks. A larger version of the gallon tank that held  gallons was also developed it was commonly used as a napalm container.A gallon laminated paper tank of British design began to be distributed in fall  coming to various fighter groups from September to November. It only was able to hold fuel for the duration of a mission and yielded no usable material to the enemy if recovered. The original paper tanks were doped silver a later steel variation made in the United States that looked exactly the same was painted gray. A gallon wide flat steel tank was developed as a belly tank for the P in February . It could also be carried on the wing pylons like the   and gallon tanks. At the end of  a gallon variant of this tank was used by the th Fighter Group to allow the wing pylons to be removed from their PMs increasing speed.PThe P flew its first escort mission in December  not January gt SUNDAY  DECEMBER gt STRATEGIC OPERATIONS Eighth Air Force VIII Bomber Command Mission .

9739347,0,t1_dadkwl4,The answer to both of your questions first we have to see if we agree on the fundamental premise of why we have elections. I say its to reflect the collective opinion of the citizenry to express the will of the people as it were. If someone with more votes loses then that indicates that the particular method of an election is not good at expressing the collective opinion of the people. So thats why I think that OPs solution of eliminating Senators from the electoral count while nice is no solution at all because that more fundamental problem is still there. As for which voting method is better theres been a lot of research done on two fronts by political scientists and mathematicians. The first is to find voting systems with the least amount of paradoxes such as vote splitting in first past the post which undermine an elections intent of accurately measuring the opinion of the voting public. Second research has been done on various vote methods to show how often they do in fact accurately articulate the collective will such as Bayesian regret analysis rangevoting.orgBayRegDum.html .

The Armenians dont have primacy on the land. Almost every single historical map also had the words French or British written over half the world. Definitions change. Palestine was often labeled Israel on maps to does not mean the Jews were the majority.And yes Armenian names were modified but so were Kurdish ones. It was not trying to erase Armenians specifically it was all non Turkish groups And yes the numbers are unreliable in your fucking favor. Do you really think that the Armenian estimate of their own population would be way lower than reality? Yes or no? Also again I have pre massacre statistics before the first major wave of immigration. And if you want to count before that Armenia does not get eastern Armenia because until the migrations it was majority Azeri. Also almost no Muslims were resettled in the region. It was a long term goal but that was never achieved. They caused no major demographic shift.And yes numbers absolutely determine who deserves land. Or do you believe that democracy is not ok?

For the record Ive never heard of anyone saying that Presevo and the other places in that area arent in Serbia geographically. News to me. When I was in Kosovo the local Albanians never talked about that area as if it was important to them at all. The Albanians in Kosovo would often talk about Mitrovica in Northern Kosovo though and there was a lot of problems up there with them and the Serbians.Hate and nationalism. Does lots of bad for this word.All that said as an outsider looking in it is odd that some parts of Kosovos eastern boarder werent bumped out to accommodate these people and its also odd that Northern Kosovo which is Serbian didnt remain in Serbia after the breakup.

Its  urban has  people in that tiny district and votes Democrat by a margin of .The map appears to shine a light on the rise of Republican control but it does so without citing which district it is looking at. The most ridiculous district the pink one the one that was obviously designed in a very specific way is a heavily Democratic district.Just calling out the map maker on a lack of information and obvious bias. Whether or not you think this is a disgrace to democracy you need to know exactly what youre looking at here to make that judgement.

10045693,0,t1_dbgxn7u,I am in fact asserting that it is a mathematical problem and there is no need to have a humans intuition to solve it. Computers and math can model human behavior and this is not only known but widely accepted. Look at Nash equilibrium I think youre arguing a strawman. I never said that computers can model human consciousness or understand the smell of roses or something. Redistricting is a numerical question. Its not even a question of human behavior. All it is balancing a quantity of humans in a defined surface area. You can prove all day long that computers dont really understand human behavior and that they dont even know why people ultimately do things and I will agree. Knowing that isnt necessary to draw a district. Are you suggesting that the panels that draw districts go out and talk to the voters individually and interview them? They dont. They sit in a room with some set of data and make a decision based on the data set. Computers can do that because that is a mathematical problem.I think we disagree on something that is both fundamental to our worldviews and completely irrelevant to the problem of redistricting. Im sorry math hurt your feelings but dont think you can run around telling people that problems cant be solved by computers because you feel like they are too complicated. This is what is frequently referred to as a lie. ,MapPorn,dbgz9tc,1,t5_2si92

10231069,0,t1_dc3pt2b,Facts almost all point to whites being genetically better. White IQ is higher than that of Africans and Amerindians and lower than that of Asians. This IQ gap persists at all levels of income though IQ does rise with higher incomes. Presumably IQ will be equal once affirmative action reaches its goal and places blacks above whites in terms of income. Whites also have been shown to have higher time preference be better abstract thinkers and be more creative. Certainly I wouldnt go so far as to say white people are just better but I think any appraisal of history and genetic differences point to whites being better in some fields and Africans in other fields.Beside that many of these countries are majority nonwhite. Your point seems to be blackindigenous people were historically violently subjugated. But what does that have to do with prosperity and standard of living today? Finland was violently subjugated by Russia as were Latvia Lithuania Estonia Ukraine Belarus etc  and maybe of those were subjugated by the USSR more recently than the indigenous people of South America. Theyre all fine nations today at least compared to South America  even though some of them have only been independent for about  years whereas most South American nations have been independent for about  years.Theres also the example of Paraguay to bring up. Paraguay is on par with Bolivia one of the worst in South America yet the history of violent subjugation you decry was actually strongly fought against  the very first leader of independent Paraguay Jose Gaspar Rodriguez de Francia made it so that only mixed marriages could be had essentially forcing Paraguay to become a beige country. Certainly the violent subjugation ended many years ago? Maybe some of the newlybeige Paraguayans were white on the inside and they kept oppressing the other Paraguayans who were similar in appearance? Finally I want to point out that indigenous and black groups were not solely oppressed by whites nor were whites not oppressed. There were huge amounts of tribal warfare among the Amerindians of South America the Inca were brutal killers who performed human sacrifice and ate the hearts of their enemies. In Africa tribal warfare was also brutal and the blacks who were supposedly oppressed by whites were held in slavery by fellow blacks and sold to Europeans for a fair price. Meanwhile whites in many of these colonies faced hardships racism and oppression as well  just look at the history of South America Spain enlisted the help of many mestizo llaneros who hated the criollo whites and the Argentine independence war killed  of whites there. Or North America where Anglo and Franco Canadians hated each other over the Francos being given certain rights and where Francos claim oppression and try to secede.The same story is true of Catalans Galicians Welsh Scottish Irish Flemish Walloon Sami etc. people. All of them face oppression in some way or did in the past. Every one of them is doing better today than South Americans even though nonwhites make up a majority in many South American countries. Especially the ones that are doing the worst!Your claim that racism is the problem rather than race is a classic case of liberals stretching to explain why the obvious answer is wrong. Yet it just doesnt ring true. The best way we can help improve the standards of living in South America and especially Mexico is to help fight the crime there  if you want to blame someone for violently subjugating South American black and indigenous people look to Los Zetas Zapatistas and the Sendero Luminoso. ,MapPorn,dc3qz1y,-4,t5_2si92

10264842,0,t3_5mz7mu,In England the north is seen as poor and the south is seen as rich and the north is indeed much poorer than the south. In  the Oxford Union debated When going North wogs begin at Barnet while humorous of course it was based on a real perception in the south of the north. In this video of northern Brexit voters people talk about the south as if it were a foreign country that they could never move to with wealth their region could never hope to achieve.This is very different from in the US where New Yorkers might similarly call anything west of the Hudson River rural or the West but generally speaking wouldnt make the distinction based on a perceived wealth gap. No New Yorker would claim that Dallas or Atlanta or Phoenix or Pittsburgh or Boise is poor nor would the residents of those cities concede that NYC is wealthier as opposed to larger or more glamorous or more exciting. Ive made this point elsewhere. Quoting myselfConsider the USs  largest metro areas In order NYC  of the total US population LA  Chicago  DC San Francisco Bay area Boston Philly Dallas Miami and Houston. They comprise one third of the countrys population and the list is overall a very balanced one  in the Northeast  in the midAtlantic  in the Southeast  in the Midwest  in TX  on the West Coast   in the Sunbelt  not  on the East Coast  not  on the East Coast  on the West Coast  in betweenEtc. etc. Now consider this map of the UK and this list of the largest UK urban areas Note how other than London only one SouthamptonPortsmouth of the top ten is below the Severn Wash line. Greater London is gigantic relatively speaking compared to its US counterparts of the entire countrys population !and has no national peers the way LA and Chicago are real rivals to NYC.This causes a huge imbalance wherein London  sucks up most of the capital and human energy that would otherwise supply cities south of the Severn Wash and  sucks up much of the capital and human energy that would otherwise supply the country north of the Severn Wash. No region of the United States is grossly wealthier or poorer than others to the extent that the Severn Wash in the UK divides the poor north with the wealthy south.The current Conservative government is talking about forming a Northern Powerhouse to help relieve the above imbalance. Devolution cant be only at the homenation level though because England is so much larger than the other three combined. If England wants Scotland to stay in the union it will have to break itself up for unitys sake. Regional devolution will hopefully give the new statesprovinces a chance to compete with Greater London on a more equal footing and as in other federations around the world come up with innovative localspecific solutions to their own issues.CC uSuburbian ,MapPorn,dc7kqj2,33,t5_2si92
10265420,0,t1_dc47wvn,So yes it is considered economical but what does that mean? There are only vague descriptions of that process and none of them full explain what economical really is.  And there is a lot of problems with confounding as companies have a financial interest in keeping those listed as reserves because their status as a reserve can be used to get loans to start a mine.  Appalachia has lower sulfur coal which is why PRB coal is shipped halfway around the world. No. PRB coal is some of the lowest sulphur coal at around . sulphur.  Western Kentucky coal is some of the highest sulphur content at around  on average sulphur content Page .  Metallurgical coal is not really a factor.   of EKY coal went to metallurgical uses.  Industrial and other sectors account for  all total all other uses outside power generation is about .  Power plants still account for  of EKY coal use Page . In  power plants accounted for  as much more was exported then.  Now exports are around  of total Kentucky coal uses.  So even with the market cornered on metallurgical coal it still represents a fraction of the coal mined and at only  of current volume would not be a booming industry if power plant no longer used coal.  But power plants in Kentucky are relying on cheaper Western Kentucky Coal.  EKY InState Page  only accounts for  of coal use.  Most coal from eastern Kentucky is shipped out of state but used domestically in other power plants. But as you can see here    Page  The number of power plants that the coal is being shipped to is dwindling.  Either they are using other coal or they have switched to natural gas or have closed.  Because thanks to comrade Obama and his gestapo EPA theyve shut down all these power plants.  But somehow no one is without power.  It could be that increased energy efficiency across the board has overall reduced need for electricity. This increased energy efficiency stems from the Energy Policy Act of  signed in by George Bush SR.  It allows for provisions for increased energy efficiency electric cars alternative energy and technology.  What came from this was scrubbers that removed the sulfur from the smoke of coal fired power plants allowing them to use cheaper but dirtier coal.  Sulfur a targeted pollutant of the Clean Air Act Amendments of  once again signed into law by Once again our friend George Herbert Walker Bush.  Another technological advantage that came from the  act was fracking.  The technology that lowered the price of natural gas such that it could out compete coal for electricity production.  But not just yet in Kentucky we still get  Page  of our electricity from coal fired power plants.  Its just that most of it is dirty cheap coal from western Kentucky.  We mined all the feasible coal ages ago is one of the stupidest things I ever heard If it is so feasible to mine and such a superior product then why is Wyoming producing  million tons per year and not Kentucky?  If it was so economically feasible why would Kentucky be importing  Page  of its coal from other states.  Kentucky used almost  times as much coal from Wyoming than it did from Eastern Kentucky last year.  But its totally still economically feasible right?   ,MapPorn,dc7n3hx,1,t5_2si92

10767377,0,t3_5u1een,For people who wonder why the Appalachian region is so badThen theres a problem unique to Appalachia that might be driving up cancer rates in the region coal mining.The coal extraction business has a been a fundamental part of central Appalachian life for decades. Although many mines have closed recently the industry still thrives. In  more than  million tons of coal were extracted from  underground and  surface mines in central Appalachia and the industry earned about  billion in revenue in .The longstanding concerns over the impact of the mines on the environment and human health have intensified in recent years with the advent of mountaintop mining. Begun in the s MTM also called surface mining escalated in the s as a cheaper way to access the energyrich bituminous coal beds lying beneath the Appalachian mountain forests. After a forest is cleared explosives are used to blast away mountain peaks to expose seams of coal within. Debris from the blasts is deposited in the nearby valleys. Seen from above MTM looks like brown rash splotches on a green body.MTM is incredibly efficient. It also may be making people sick. A study of  counties in central Appalachia found that those with MTM have higher rates of cancers of the colon liver lung and cervix as well as leukemia compared with counties without mining. Cancerrelated deaths were also more common in the MTM counties.The mechanism connecting MTM to cancer is likely the release of carcinogens into the environment. A U.S. Geological Survey investigation of MTM regions in central Appalachia found high levels of aluminum and silicatwo known carcinogensin air samples from the region. The study also found traces of chromium sulfate selenium and magnesium in the air research shows that these components of granite rock may be directly carcinogenic or may elevate the risk of cancer through respiratory damage. As Bill Orem one of the USGS researchers involved in the work notes the findings were what you would expect since youre blowing up the top of a mountain. Another study found elevated levels of arsenic also carcinogenic in toenail samples from residents of Appalachian Kentucky.In one recent study human lung cells in a lab were exposed to particulates found in air samples within a mile of an MTM in West Virginia. After three months of exposurewhat would translate to about eight and a half years of breathing in bodybound lung cellsthey started to act like cancer cells dividing more rapidly than normal. The same wasnt true for an accompanying group of cells exposed to air from another rural area in West Virginia not near a surface mine. I cant definitely say yes mountaintop removal causes lung cancer says Indiana University public health professor Michael Hendryx coauthor of this  study published in Environmental Science and Technology  but I believe that it does based on the whole body of evidence.Source,MapPorn,ddqkpsi,192,t5_2si92

Which requires physical and intellectual infrastructure that only exists in cities. But that identity can still revolve around life in the countryside. Indeed if you look at the actual historical examples this is exactly what you see over the course of the th and th century. Trade was prospering in cities many young people moved there from the countryside from their ranks came the young intellectuals that played key role in establishing national identity but their works revolved around life in the countryside. There was another reason for that  that was the period of romanticism in European culture which was a reaction to all the ugliness of the Industrial Revolution a mostly urban phenomenon and which looked to the countryside as an idealistic place of beauty peace inspiration. etc.,MapPorn,ddx2d83,2,t5_2si92

Id say that on a national level NY is pretty much the culturalfinancial center of the country. It has publishing theater the biggest and most prestigious tv markets the most important museums outside of the smithsonian the most important culinary scene...it just goes on and on. Hell Im in tech and just by being NY it has the largest tech economy after Silicon Valley. Its GDP is something monstrous it really does not compare to any other city in the Americas let alone the US. Its ethnic and cultural makeup where no group truly dominates and we have plenty of k communities is something pretty unique. Id also say densitywise at least in manhattan makes it closer to Hong Kong or Tokyo then London or Paris. Our mass transit is an outlier nationally and stacks fairly well against others internationally. What Im trying to say is that it is the global superpowers most important city. We host the United Nations. I think its the only alpha rated city besides London. Im not saying this city is the cleanest or the safest or the easiest to live in.

With a bit of luck the boom sticks and the economy matures to the point it can sustain itself and the EU funding tapers off or your GDP rises so that your contribution comes to meet what you receive. The same happens in kind then for new joining members. Some mammoth economies contribute vastly more to the EU budget but benefit in other ways currency value being dragged down by weaker members and larger tarriff free export market.Look at Ireland for example most of its history in the EU it was receiving vastly more than it contributed.

11329330,0,t1_dffzecx,gt The East had a better rooting of the Greek foundations of philosophy and knowledge even after converting due to proximity.I would say Greek philosophy and Christianity is not necessarily contradicting forces. In fact I would say Christianity as it existed today since Christs supposed crucifixion owes more to Greek influence rather than its original Semitic origin. The epistles themselves were originally written in Koine Greek instead of Aramaic or Hebrew.   gt In the West they had to hire tutors for it or go there to learn throughout all its history. When they fully converted they stopped doing so.When the empire has collapsed in the West the Christian conversion is still far from complete. In fact under Theodorics reign in Italy there were still a prominent pagan aristocracy in Rome like Boethius. gt The East had a better army since they had consistent border skirmishes and warfare as well. Nah its not as if the West did not have persistent warfare within their borders as well. Theres a reason that the de facto capital of the late Western empire was often near the frontiers such as in Milan or Ravenna and that is to basically guard the frontiers from attacks by Germanic tribes like Alamanni Franks etc.gt once they became Christian there were no Roman ideals of serving in the army.Christianity has less to do with Roman manpower problems than the fact that Romans continue to waste their manpower on pointless civil wars. Battles such as Mursa Major or Frigidus did more to decimate manpower than people abstaining for monasticreligious obligations.Another thing to note is that most Germanic tribes at that point in time like Goths Vandals Burgundians Suebi etc. had already converted to Arian form of Christianity before they entered the empire. Their Christianity didnt really managed to diminish their military capabilities.   gt It could be argued that Christianity did mess with the West but it didnt effect the East due to what was set up there already.Christianity is a neutral factor it neither weakened nor strengthened the empire. Around the time of Christianitys spread traditional Roman paganism and the Imperial cult had effectively lost its influence to eastern religions due to social and institutional uncertainty caused by rapid unseatings and accessions of emperors. If not Christianity it would be some other eastern religion like Mithraism Manichaeanism or maybe the followers of Apollonius of Tyana and the outcome would eventually be the same.,MapPorn,dfg5sna,8,t5_2si92

11471455,0,t3_63m1fn,All I can imagine the longer that I stare at this is the climate similarities that exist between the regions as they overlay. We dont expect weather in Florida to feel like it does in Maine but both states are on the east coast of the same country and civilians are both supposed to feel national pride toward the same entity. Now climatewise were talking about regions as different as Egypt and Russia. I feel that this may have wide cultural impact when you consider the USA as a whole. Im from New England and I can tell you first hand how a sense of community develops when people are exposed to similar geography and weather patterns. It would be interesting to see a study to determine a correlation between sense of community relative to country size. I feel inclined to believe it would be easier to identify with your fellow countrymen living in a smaller country like those in Europe than such a large sprawling mass like America. I know that I take more pride in being from where Im from in America than being American personally and Im not the only one.There are some interesting societal implications I feel this map raises especially regarding nationalism and country size.,MapPorn,dfwa8ho,1,t5_2si92

11656444,0,t1_dgh5tst,Most countries are rife with corruption the only reason Latin America is singled out is because the media likes pointing it out. The American government is by no means an example of transparency or honest behavior Americans just prefer to not talk about it or minimize whats happening. That said I dont use politics to define any country in the planet and the only place you guys choose to do so are the ones you know little about. Italy is super corrupt I know that fact but thats not what comes to mind when I think of it.As for facts about Colombia well the Machu Picchu is there Americans and Europeans love visiting it so Id imagine theyd have a bad time going to Mexico and not finding it. Mexico has specific culture as rich as the Brazilian samba and capoeira which stem from the African diaspora in the country both are relevant and just as interesting as the fact that China created rice or that Germany has good beer.Your decision to respect or take seriously any kind of cultural or geographical aspects of Latin America is conditional to your consideration of the whole places relevance which in my opinion is fueled by prejudice and lack of knowledge. There is no reason to consider contemporary Europe more interesting or important to know about than any of us here. But I will no longer try to illustrate that point. I dont care enough.

I hear constantly about the ways in which people routinely lose their jobs and are publicly shamed for expressing opinions incongruent with the conventional narrative espeially with regards to immigration. Newspapers in the past have banned all advertising from certain political parties. Newspapers and govt itself are frequently caught covering up important information relevant to big stories and in general there seems to be a large effort to maintain the states narrative.
