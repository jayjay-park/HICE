39903,0,t3_1uc6g1,nice job.  what are you using as minis?,zombicide,ceiz2e6,2,t5_2upxx
2742272,0,t3_2rdp8t,Put those board tiles under some heavy books for a few days so theyll lay flat.,zombicide,cnfs9o9,1,t5_2upxx
4254762,0,t1_cs2tagz,This is my first kickstarter and didnt know they offered all the other seasons optionally during Season !Also notice they gave  discounts on optional purchases as well to those that backed Season .,zombicide,cs588en,1,t5_2upxx
4346324,0,t3_3asjdu,This will be unlocked at the . mil mark because it is the total amount raised for the season  kick starter of zombicide.,zombicide,csfk9t9,1,t5_2upxx
4414094,0,t1_csn5cf0,Yeah...I think this is a great idea..You could even have where a certain number like  on a die will stun it for a turn but only with a dmg weapon of  or greater.,zombicide,csn7bod,1,t5_2upxx
4598625,0,t3_3e04l0,So I just picked up season  for cheap on massdrop. Decided to create a poll to try to get season  or  cheap as well.,zombicide,cta8w06,2,t5_2upxx
4628159,0,t3_3ec7ls,I forgot to add we dont play with zombivors so dead is dead. But if someone dies the player can select a new survivor start with zero xp and start at the survivor spawn with one random item card. If they dare enter the game with a blue survivor at that point!,zombicide,ctdy8q8,1,t5_2upxx
4736708,0,t3_3fsd0f,Id do  for one.,zombicide,ctrlswv,1,t5_2upxx

6037300,0,t1_cyaq71d,gtIf you didnt back until December nd why should you get it at the same time as those of us who backed it in July? Late backer means later shipment. All U.S. orders have been  shipped!Thats why. ,zombicide,cyb04af,1,t5_2upxx
6153421,0,t1_cyovigf,Apologies. My replies with direct links were not posting.Cooler  Water Bottles  MA,zombicide,cyp2w17,1,t5_2upxx
6614583,0,t1_d025y1g,Kitchenfoodhealing sounds quite awesome! I have to admit Im kinda getting in the mood for some Zombiecide with all this talk P,zombicide,d03i5py,2,t5_2upxx
7756524,0,t3_4lj1wx,Where are you based? ,zombicide,d3nuwjl,1,t5_2upxx
7790146,0,t1_d3rjwe7,Fantastic. Thanks. This has me even more excited.  We didnt get any addons. Werent sure if wed like it so didnt want to splurge past the  we were already spending but man the base game has been so much fun we are excited to get new goodies.Did you get emailed a tracking number before you received it?,zombicide,d3ro3j2,2,t5_2upxx
7848508,0,t1_d3xzkqm,Im pumped to have actual survivors to choose from. Black Plague was the first Zombicide for us to play and it gets a bit stale using the same characters every game so having this many options will be great for the wife kiddo amp I. Sooo pumped.,zombicide,d3y8pvc,1,t5_2upxx
7998294,0,t1_d4erpy0,Well damn...thats  months today.,zombicide,d4f327h,1,t5_2upxx
8014118,0,t1_d4gh5zy,I would think that two or three coats of the dull clear coat would protect them from the minor abuse of being stored all together.,zombicide,d4gv0uj,2,t5_2upxx
8562053,0,t1_d6brxgl,Sorry for calling it a campaign but yes we are doing them in order. Just didnt know if it is good to wait or just toss em into the missions and go. Was mainly looking for ideas as to what people are playing in their groups ,zombicide,d6bu1e5,1,t5_2upxx
10148485,0,t3_5laosb,Some pink foam board carved and then painted. Im thinking about fitting it to where its just the actual tower the player pieces go on.,zombicide,dbucm6s,2,t5_2upxx
10157712,0,t3_5laosb,Ive thought about doing d terrain for ZBP I have some wargame terrain stuff but if I make it in scale it will block player LOS and make it harder to move minis and if I make it low its only usuable for Zombicide. I was thinking about doing halfbuildings with the upper half being detachable but thats a lot of effort and Id have to make  tiles since d tiles wouldnt be reversible.,zombicide,dbvflr6,2,t5_2upxx
11166477,0,t3_5zavsk,I went for foam board and plastic angles for the corners. Really solid and has been worth the effort! ,zombicide,dexpijb,1,t5_2upxx
11542362,0,t1_dg3nnwb,Couldnt have said it better myself. Its not uncommon for someone to start to accumulate xp faster but then they and the group need to decide how they want to proceed so a xp threshold isnt passed earlier than it should ,zombicide,dg4bu31,2,t5_2upxx
