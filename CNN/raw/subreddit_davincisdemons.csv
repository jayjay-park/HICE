1125930,0,t3_26zw31,How can they do this  seasons in a row it is totally ridiculous. That is twice now that the last episode should have been part  of a  parter. A season finale is meant to wrap some things up and introduce new plot threads to follow. This episode was just another episode no closure whatsoever. I dont think it is acceptable to the fans how they can leave on such a huge cliff hanger with nothing resolved to next season. I hate Doctor Who but at least in Doctor Who this episode would be the first of a  part season finale. Good episode on its own but in the context of a season I dont like how they plan it at all.,davincisdemons,chw9y3s,7,t5_2vugo
