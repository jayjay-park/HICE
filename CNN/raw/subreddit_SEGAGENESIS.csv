912695,0,t1_ch7xlwx,I can convert a code from NTSC or PAL in about  seconds. Its just a matter of finding the equivalent part of the game that the code alters.This code REBTAWG should work as a master code in sonic  it disables the checksum and this code RTGVG should make you invincible in sonic . You will still lose rings when you get hit but you wont die.I think the PAL and NTSC versions of sonic  are the same since it automatically adjusts for  and  HZ rather than having two different versions. If that is true sonic  codes should work for both region sonic  games.At any rate converting codes to work on different versions of games isnt too hard once you figure out how to do it. I will be more than willing to help convert some game genie codes for you.For example the code APBTNG starts you off on the final level in sonic spinball. But it is made for the NTSC version of the game. The European version is slightly different and some of the data is in different places.I found the area that the NTSC game genie code modified and found the equivalent area in the PAL rom.I repackaged the code with the new ROM address and got ANAN. This code will have the same effect but works for the PAL version.,SEGAGENESIS,ch812ds,1,t5_2s7x2

2625719,0,t1_cn19g93,Theres a link to my first run of fifty episodes. I just cover Master System GenesisMega Drive SEGA CDMega CD SEGA X Saturn and Dreamcast. Ill review their respective games consoles and so on. Eventually Id like to tackle their early efforts SG and Game Gear but money and access are limited.  I still listen to cassettes and I still have a healthy collection of VHS tapes. Some years back Id actually trade my short films with movie collectors for something from their collection. Ended up getting workprint copies of John Woos Hard Target  minutes of added footage and The Crow Skull Cowboy scenes and added violence intact. Theyre all on VHS.  ,SEGAGENESIS,cn1bg5w,2,t5_2s7x2

I kept all my games from my childhood and have a good collection of cartridges and will start by checking out my local retro game store for the Genesis  with the HD Graphics logo!I can always YouTube the nightrap game in full.

9216264,0,t3_56ibr1,Use a pencil eraser trim one of these to fit and scrub the pins vigorously with it. Clean with denatured alcohol afterwards.Ive had various Genesis games over the years that just wouldnt work no matter what I tried and no matter how intensely I cleaned them with regular rubbing alcohol etc. Once I started doing this Ive never had a game not work.This is all assuming your cartridge connector has been thoroughly cleaned. I recommend component cleaner for that.If you have tried this already and its a no go then it must be a fault in the cart itself or some odd problem involving Gen hardware.EDIT I should add this is my go to cleaning regimen for any cartridge based system. My brother and I have brought many lost cause games and systems back from the dead doing this. ,SEGAGENESIS,d8k8a14,1,t5_2s7x2
