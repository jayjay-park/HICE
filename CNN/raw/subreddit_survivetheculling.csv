That way nobody has an advantage and your teammate can be there just as soon as your enemies teammate  and you still have the chance to kill an opponent if youre fast enough. With m you will almost never be able to kill somebody before his teammate arrives. Some people might say but i queue up v so I can play v!

Even if half of the players youre against are somehow doing those things it isnt because they are intentionally playing on a server with higher ping youre delusional. Why do I have to back anything up with facts when you can just say whatever you want and thats apparently fine?Lowering everyones ping would be great so would weapon camos multiple maps achivements and more weapons but they arent all being worked on and they arent even shit ideas unlike yours. Thats because Devs have to prioritise what they want to do with their game and cant waste time adding worthless shit like your suggestion. They would have to get better servers to lower ping wasting their time adding a region lock feature would do NOTHING to help ping since a massive majority of players if not all are already playing are playing on the server with better ping for them since in a battle of low ping v high ping low ping has the advantage Im sure youll argue this point with bbut some guy in this game wouldnt die just git gud and you wont have that problem.,survivetheculling,d0xmkwx,-1,t5_3cavp

If i know from the start where everything is i basically cut my playtime by several hours several hours in which i would also couls have learned the other things.Learning everything by yourself or in a community is the best way to play a game.

6947798,0,t1_d13c6yv,well. one argument would be that the culling is heavily inspired by the hunger games which took place over several days the night adding a different kind of gameplay. I agree that it should not be added to the default mode however the map is small enough that it would add an interesting dynamic to the game in a SEPERATE game mode. Possibly even between friends. In both the hunger games and battle royale which inspired this game it takes place over many days and the long game tactics that are involved is very interesting also having certain areas off limits at different times of the day is what all current battle royale games are lacking. And to be honest having different areas have hazards or shut down would be too much for a  minute game but just right for a  hour or so game. ,survivetheculling,d13v40g,1,t5_3cavp

7008299,0,t1_d1ap1sl,I just hope they will split up the weapon types a bit more. Knuckles should be in a separate category same with bare hands improving the earlygameunarmed combat! leaving the bludgeons out. Having a separate perk for knuckles is pointing in that direction anyway.Right now the weapons are not balanced and we also have different amounts.First knifes and swords counts as the same weapon but they are not besides having a blade. And they are a LOT of them.Other types of weapons dont have that many weapons in each category. We only have  spears now crafted javelin survival. Second craftable weapons. The bludgeon build is weak because you dont have a starting weapon. You have to get lucky and find something useful knuckles or a crowbar everything else at tampt is meh or get to your airdrop without having an intense fight. Running away is harder since you dont have that additional  runspeed and without a bludgeon your perks dont do anything you cant drain stamina and then run away without the right type of weapon. So please add a craftable bludgeon.

Holding onto Explosive Runs stims or explosives can also serve a similar purpose although not consistently. The options to combat archers are readily available. If youre going to run a primarily melee build then you need to account for your weaknesses which is ranged combat by using some or all of those options. I dont think bows are really overpowered right now. Or at the very least I havent had much of a problem fighting them.The other real simple option is to practice using a bow and just shoot them better than they can shoot you.

Example You got hit by an arrow? Run behind a tree or away and after  seconds you get  hp back. And every  seconds until you are full HP.This was an idea I had before the recent patch.

7124909,0,t1_d1o08ly,I purchased this game about a week and a half ago and participated in several forum posts on that very subject. Was the stunlock only recently removed? Perhaps thats what happened I am not sure. Just last week someone even had a poll going for the removal of chainsaws that received a sizable number of supporters  not enough to warrant change but still more than average.And Guns may very well have been overpowered in Alpha all the way up to this very point. But I feel after the last minor nerfs that lowered gun damage slightly placed them in pretty good spot balance wise. Or so it seems to me. I just never have much issue handling opponents with guns. I just finished a match moments ago where I took out two opponents near the end of a match in seperate fights both of which had guns pulled out on me. One emptied his smg into me managed to take a bit of cover and avoid some of the damage and I immediately threw a smoke bomb and moved in and kept the pressure on him until taking him down. Then the second person I encountered after having healed and made satchel armor had a magnum and he managed to get a shot off on me as I charged him but I threw a stick at him pulled out blow gun and shot him and then charged him with my melee weapon. Same results.,survivetheculling,d1o0qeb,1,t5_3cavp

Two or three times max per fight versus the current average player as the average skill level is still relatively low. Plus big boned will absorb some of that bleed where tough mother doesnt as bleed isnt affected by  damage reduction. Definitely recommend big boned if youre trying to go for a tanky build.

You sound like the  year old to me. Any other game? Many FPS games award assists rather than kills. I even went and tested in CSGO offline with bots in competitive got lit by the bots then threw a grenade at my feet and I got  death and  kill and nobody on the enemy team was awarded a kill or even an assist for that.

The thing is there are a TON of places these can spawn even between buildings. As you start to learn their locations you can get a good feel for which buildings might be better to loot and which ones might not. Id say it also depends a bit on your build. If youre running knives bludgeons or knuckles its worth checking lockers and the such. Other builds maybe not so much.Example If you spawn near the airport go for those three little buildings first. There is always a green crate in one of them. Then you can head to the main building to loot that up and there is often another green or red crate there.,survivetheculling,d1w82ls,2,t5_3cavp

7215304,0,t1_d1y8umi,I dont think any builds in this game require a high skill ceiling. People make this game out to be like its Starcraft sometimes. Every fight is different and hectic and full of mayhem. But if you have just good mechanics you can handle just about anything. Hell I had backpacker load dropper and rwk on and still won a good  of my games yesterday. Its about your core mechanics at the end of the day. Thats why I dont think any build requires gosu skills but the players mechanics need to be solid to take any fight. Now that being said my whole point on GA not requiring a bunch of skill to pull off is simple. One hit thats it. You need one hit to take a massive lead in the fight. And you can say yeah sure but one hit with a gun is the same! The difference is you can do that massive damage at the start of the game with a crafted spear instead of mid to late game with a gun. If you land just one hit the fight drastically shifts to the GA favor. I dont understand whats skillful about a build that at the start of the game can essentially two shot someone. The build is just counter to normal melee  combat and goes against what I think is the spirit of the game. Theres something just awesome about a good back and forth melee fight where each side goes all out and each does well with one player barely making it out alive. There is nothing special about fighting a GA user. Period. If you want to offer changes to GA to make it better just reduce the damage. Its insanely fucking high and its just stupid. ,survivetheculling,d1ybo7z,1,t5_3cavp

There are exceptions and solutions to the law especially when people are added earlier rather than later in the project and with the game being in alpha Id consider this a pretty early stage in development despite already having a working monetized version of the game. Moreover even though adding a new person to the team may slow development slightly at first I suspect that after the initial rampup period of that employee the team as a whole would benefit in the long run. Note that Im not suggesting a drastic increase in team size.

7385354,0,t1_d2hjy9w,Hey Im glad youre up for civil discussion of the topic instead of just arguing and I appreciate that. Kudos! Ill tackle your points one at a time below.  First I agree that players leaving early game is a problem. However I disagree that this will fix that issue in any way. Players who would get upset or leave the match if the airdrop isnt one they want will almost certainly leave either way. They arent worried about winning or otherwise winning any round theyre in and this change results in these players simply getting further annoyed when the package isnt the one theyre after. They arent going to stick around just to lose to those who were lucky enough to open a good airdrop at an insane price theyll just leave even more annoyed then usual possibly after removing other players from the game. Atleast as the system stands now these players leave the game as its beginning instead of the earlymid match area when a player suddenly leaving could significantly affect what items are available to others.  Players who only play for the fun of variety might enjoy this a bit more but I suspect these players arent as widespread as those who wish to unlock things but wish to stick around. And frankly the current surprise airdrop works fine for players who just want variety.  However the true danger is that you also risk upsetting players who under the current system would have stayed and played through their games anyway. These players might want to unlock new airdrops but enjoy the game enough to play regardless of if its new or not. The thing about these players is that even if their airdrop sucks they know it sucks going in and they can decide what sort of strategy to use in game. They have the power to decide if the airdrop is worth it or not or if that func is better spent elsewhere. But if we were to introduce this system then they MUST  put that func into getting the airdrop. If that airdrop is bad then they have just spent a major chunk of func buying items that just werent worth it and now they arent just out an airdrop theyre out a very good chunk of tempo. Worse if the airdrop contains nothing at all or even explodes and damages them theyre not only out the func with atleast items they can hopefully sell back theyre COMPLETELY out. Now these players who are trying to fill out their airdrop sets are significantly worse off than they are under this system. They dont just feel like they cant boost their collection this game they feel that they have wasted time and effort just to be handed a crate that might as well say You lose. They dont just feel bad they feel cheated. And now you risk them leaving as well or just straight quitting for the day with negative feelings about the game.  It also bears worth mentioning that these last type of players tend to be NEW. Because of the way the airdrop system works these players are the most likely to use the random airdrops and these are the exact players you want to enjoy your game the most. A long standing player is less likely to quit the game then someone whos just started.   Also players that are likely to get mad when they dont get the drop they want would probably just pick a fixed drop in the first place instead of gambling.  This is true under the current system strictly because all of the airdrops have a price associated with their power. If this were removed then the strategy changes. The optimal strategy is no longer Choose a crate based on a weighing of the risks for saving for it or not but instead becomes Use the random crate to get a huge power boost as quickly as humanely possible. It is INCREDIBLY difficult to compete with someone who has the best late game equipment while you are attempting to save up nearly double what theyve payed for it. No one would willingly choose these late game crates when they wont live to buy them because another player was lucky. In order to compete with those who are lucky youd have to go for the luck of the draw yourself.  Onto your next point. Competitive games are awfully tricky to balance for fun. There was actually a fantastic article by a designer of Magic The Gathering on this topic Ill see if I cant dig it up. But the basic idea was that you have to make a game fun for players on both the winning and losing ends of system.  I play Smash Bros. competitively and go to tournaments nearly every weekend I can. Ive seen players nearly break down and cry after losing an important match. But the thing about these players is that they almost always come back to more tournaments. Even though they lost they found the game fun. The game has to be engaging enough that when you lose you feel like its your fault. That you didnt lose because you were unlucky but because you made some error or mistake that led to you losing the game or the match. Smash Bros especially has very little randomness in its mechanics which is already quite different than a game of The Culling. However the difference is that the Culling is played over a MUCH longer timeframe than Smash is. With proper map knowledge you can make a break for buildings from the very beginning of the game and minimize that random factor. You can choose perks that help you avoid players or gain func faster or all sorts of things. As the game stands now even if you are unlucky starting out theres still plenty of time to make that difference up because the REALLY powerful stuff isnt going to hit until the game.  Getting back to your point essentially what im saying is no airdrops arent meant to just be fun for the person opening them. Theyre meant to entice players towards them and make a decision about which package best suits their needs. Each one is carefully balanced to ensure that no player will become too powerful too early while enticing players to reach for them. Thats fun for everyone. The game must still be fun when other players call in an airdrop.  Finally on getting a gun early and for cheap.  BlueRed crates. Looking through The Cullings wiki the guns dont have a tier assigned to them. This would imply to me that they cannot be found in these crates. I google searched for it and found a few players claiming to have gotten guns from these crates but the nearest time I can find a claim like that was over a month ago and crates had rebalancing in the last patch. I do not know if they have changed that or not but if guns are still found in bluered crates I think they shouldnt. However pointing out examples of other flawed design doesnt mean we should add more. In addition one of these players claimed their gun only contained a single round. If these guns begin with less then a full clip of ammo this is potentially still balanced as it would require  func to open crate   to craft ammo  Time to find the crateammo. In addition you avoid the problem of a run away leader as a single round likely isnt going to be killing multiple players thus leading to enough func to craft more bullets. At the very least not nearly as quickly as the full clip from a drop will.  Grab My Package is in my opinion the weakest of the random events in the Culling and I dont agree with its inclusion. As you said though if nothing else its announced to every player and as such players know to look toward the sky to see where its heading. This creates player confrontation which is the point. Its much harder to sneak the Grab My Package airdrop then it is your own called in one.  In addition Grab My Package airdrops are always airdropped in. Theres no way to use a perk to get them without risking it being stolen as you can with your own called in packages with Load Dropper.,survivetheculling,d2hnxe9,3,t5_3cavp

7391264,0,t3_4gkhjo,The issue at large is not the random teaming that occurs within the confines of a single game but the intentional decision to purposefully create a team prior to signing into a game. Players are getting together and queuing at the exact same time in an effort to ensure that two three as many as six all get into the exact same game. This is not a team of convenience within a game but a concerted effort to enter a game with a distinct advantage over others.  While only one player can win a game the goal of these groups is typically not to win at all. The goal is to grief other players and ruin their experience. The premeditated groups will often simply log out of a game if they dont get into the same game as their group so that they can all queue again together. This is most certainly a form of cheating as it is a blatant attempt to circumvent the randomized process of being paired with unknown players. This is why Xaviant has stated that they will seek action against those who are committing premeditated teaming but will not pursue those who are simply making an alliance on the fly.,survivetheculling,d2ic4mi,2,t5_3cavp

7432924,0,t1_d2n2agx,I think the issue is that the combat most people liked was the one where all weapons were basically the same speed.  That meant the only difference between your weapon and your opponents weapon was the damage output and possibly bleed so almost any weapon could beat another given enough time.  Correcting the weapon speeds broke that inherently because now there are truly tiers of weapons which turns out people do not like very much at all comparatively.  For the record though I personally have grown to like the combat more lately.,survivetheculling,d2n2rcr,2,t5_3cavp
7434296,0,t1_d2n89ji,I agree the patch is pretty garbage. Best we can do is wait it out. I have faith in the devs they seem to be very responsive to the community.

7436834,0,t1_d2nh2pa,I believe the stamina usage to stamina gain is extremely unbalanced right now. If you turtle enough and retreat you will actually save more stamina than someone engaging in combat. So inturn it has caused more people to retreat more often from combat. Once you are out of stamina you are basically dead and with the stamina drain builds being so popular right now it is more tactical to simply retreat from most battles. Once a person engages an opponent they are already on the losing side of the stamina war because of the stamina drain from attacking and what not. So if the defender does not attack back but merely blocks and runs the aggressor will most likely never catch their opponent unless under certain circumstances like stamina shot. But if there was a stamina reward system for successful attacksblocksshoves it would encourage less spam and more strategy as the stamina gain from successful moves would then allow either person to the pursue the other if one should decide to flee the fight. Fight or flight is a very real thing we have all grown up hearing this but at this point in time in The Culling the way stamina functions flight has a higher payout than fight. The way we discuss pushshoveblock as rockpaperscissors we should start discussing stamina as fight or flight. At this moment we are discussing balance of rockpaperscissors but the discussion of fight or flight is equally as important.,survivetheculling,d2niqi6,15,t5_3cavp

7458290,0,t3_4gzz1z, Currently I feel that Xaviant has been doing a fantastic job but they have been doing such a great job at listening to the community that it has also been their undoing so far. The new pace of combat the nerfs to block nerfs to stealthy etc. These changes which have been unfavorable after implementation were in favor before implementation. It is great to listen to feedback but it is also great to be selective upon it. ampnbsp With that being said I could provide some feedback to the issue but I am not sure what can really be done. I wouldnt consider myself to be the best or top tier player but somewhere in the middle. I feel the changes to block were ultimately bad but Xaviants idea on the issue was a step in the right direction. I feel that block needs to have either of the two things happen to it.ampnbsp Reverting back to the old Blockor Reducing the block hit box by a few .s  finetuning it. Which seems to not be the favored choiceampnbspBut regardless that would leave the issue of push. Both changes would leave push at a certain state in the game. The first change would leave push to be rendered under powered and would favor a meta game that revolves around range weapons. The second change would leave push at its current state overpowered. So with the second change in mind. Push would need a counter. Something that would give players an option to punish someone who push spams but a counter that would leave you with all your health intact. What could this be?ampnbsp Attack into push leaves player stumbled but the problem with this is combat would feel to spammy Push into nothing leaves player stumbled but the problem with this is it could leave pushing to become far to under powered. Push into nothing grants a player stamina drain in excessive amounts. ampnbspOne idea I have been seen thrown around in the forums was a reward system that gives players Stamina if they preform the right actions and losing stamina if they preform the wrong actions. Which in practical use would mean that if I were to counter a block with a push I would be granted Stamina and if I were to push nothing I would lose stamina. The only problem I have with this is it would setup some form of momentum and the defensive player or losing player in that situation would be further behind. The idea is there but to implement it would be very hard.ampnbsp Ultimately what I feel should be done for now is to revert the combat changes and bring back the old block. But in exchange nerfs of range weapons should be done. Maybe not nerfing range weapons directly but indirectly by buffing Thick Skins damage reduction towards bows by   or  percent. The old combat favored Bows heavily since it was a very defensive meta. Guns are just to expensive to obtain and costly to upkeep that I feel they should remain unchanged for now. However this combat system was not the greatest and I am sure Xaviant is aware of this. Fake Blocking is an interesting mechanic but it just makes for the game to be a bit to defensive and cater towards a meta. Maybe this is what Culling players like and maybe it should be unchanged? But if Xaviant wants to change it I would advise running a test server for combat related changes and giving players an incentive to play. Particular cosmetic rewards for spending X amount of time on the test and communicating with streamers to setup a community event on the test server which would further the aid of testing new changes. ampnbspTLDR Revert combat changes to block nerf bows because of old meta and go back to the drawing board. ,survivetheculling,d2pylij,2,t5_3cavp

The air drops were intended with spear in mind to be a throwing device. That is why there is never just one in a drop. This is what i believe the devs had in mind for the spears. They have morphed into more of a melee role with the intro of peirce. I would like to see them have there strike dmg taken down alot and there throw dmg boosted up a bit. Making them more of a throwing weapon instead of a melee. If you think about it who comes into a battle poking at you with a spear? You dont you throw a spear as it was intended. once you close the distance on a spear you really shouldnt be able to fight with it.

Though they usually dont change the pattern so you know that if he pushed you you need to push because he will block right after the push for example.OR sometimes when they block and release so you miss a push they will instantly block again so you push twice.gtIve also experienced people shoving AND attacking in the same motion.They take advantage of the slight lag between you. If I just tap block and then attack you will see me blocking so you will react with a fast push which will then be countered by a quick jab since he just tapped the block button. You see the block a bit longer on your side and then the server has to quickly process the jab since its a bit late already because of the block. But in these cases its always a pattern. block then push or push then block jab then push very quickly.These situations made me rage a few deaths but then it became just stupid and non effective.

8396598,0,t3_4umslu,Its tough for a beginner. I know  hours doesnt really sound like a beginner but when you consider that the playerbase has dwindled down to around  players majority of the players are the more skilled veterans. I wouldnt advise watching Streamers and attempting to recreate their playstyle you need to find what works for you as a specific player. LiBrizzi is probably The Cullings top Streamer and hes very skilled in combat but even I killed him a couple days ago in a  on  fight. He just had a certain playstyle that Im familiar with and know how to counter. Above all else man what matters most is that youre still having fun. If you cant get the mojo of the combat and it just frustrates you too much dont let it control you. If you still have fun though and you are determined to become a more skilled player keep at it my brutha. The more you play the better you will get and the more muscle memory youll absorb. My  priority that I can recommend is versatility. If you have experience in every situation you can prepare for them and even win them. If you want Ill do some Team matches with you and help you get the feel for fighting both  v   v  and  v . Hope this helps!PS. Didnt realize how fcking long this was until I posted it.

8523366,0,t3_4wey0p,gtPrior to this patch there werent really any perks that were that overpowered.False. Every patch brings in new overpowered perks.  patches ago it was the dig deep big boned tank build.  patches ago it was the master crafter meta which turned a crafted hatchet into a tomahawk. Now its the mangler build which turns every axe into a god tier weapon. Master crafter and big boned got nerfed to extinction pretty much and hopefully the same will happen to mangler and the whole axe weapon buff as well. The devs just need to stop buffing things that are already strong and nerfing things that are already weak. The past patch proved that because they nerfed blades which almost everyone Ive seen agreed were fine while buffing axes which were already the strongest weapon category pre patch. The amount of oversight the devs had with the balancing in the last patch amazes me and personally I will not play again until I can use a weapon besides an axe with some chance of winning. ,survivetheculling,d66zduf,0,t5_3cavp

9264514,0,t1_d8qayj6,I dont know Xaviants roadmap or the development cycle for games like this. A long time ago I was a QA tester for Sony in their thirdparty online department. We were the last testers before a release. Depending on the game these games were in development anywhere from six months to a year before we got them. But this game The Culling had certainly been in development long before the EA release. And thats not really the point. The point is except for a few graphical passes and some minor cosmetic changes we havent seen any development since EA started. Theyve tweaked features and added a few items but thats it. Now they say Big Picture and hint at a big update down the road but we know very little about it. In my opinion theyd have to win back a lot of disheartened people for that big picture update to start drawing new players in.,survivetheculling,d8qcd3z,3,t5_3cavp

Make it so that in any situation you would get staggered instead your movement speed is reduced moderately think for the duration you would normaly be staggered also the damage you do is decreased while the value of damage you take is increased for the duration of the stagger and you cant block either.  This way you get punished for getting staggered while not completely losing control also it makes complete sense  you just lost your balance so any punches you throw dont have your full weight in them thus doing less damage also you need a steady stance to block and move effectively and cant take a hit as well when youre not in balance.,survivetheculling,dbf6xat,3,t5_3cavp

10225630,0,t3_5me8j2,Let me say as a West Coast player typically dealing with  RTT the new system of combat feels better then the previous iteration. I might be wrong but that is my  cents on that. I have played since launch  hours and have won at least one match with I believe every patch to date. Mainly do FFA over teams currently.  I think Basher is way OP right now I am sure your stats show this as half players seem to run it. Mainly because the repercussion of successful block on a full charge is the same as a jab. Currently typically varies based on pingspacing if I block a jab I can get a jab. If I block a full charge I can get a jab.  My believe is a blocked full charge should carry a miniStagger in the way that they cant attack or block but can evade so not quite the same as the old from the side push which give me a Full Charge me vs Jab them Full Charge me vs Block stagger period ends just short of a general full charge or Half Charge basher full charge vs stagger state.  They get punished for going big and I get a little extra for the read. I think the block of a jab is in decent timing position. In most cases I can get a jab without a jab back occurring off a blocked jab this is how I believe it should consistently behave. when I do get jabbed back typically my ping is higherAs of now I can block a full charge get a jab in. You can get about  jabs in before opponents change behavior. Then typically they go push crazy with basher full charge spam. This ends up going into an exchange which Bashers typically win. I can keep trying to block and jab game but eventually they will get a push out of spamming and that one basher hit will equal all my jabs not exactly  but close. And Im crippled at this point so can no longer do they dance of dodging. I think throwing Weakness back in now will confuse what small adjustments need to be made to melee combat currently  to make it strongly viable. I would also see the issue of veteran players will rush with full charge then block bait instantly. Get weakness applied then they can keep doing Full Charges being blocked for basically jab level damage or attempt to forced a jab feast which they now have a massive advance with. Their cumulative damage output will be so much better then the opponent at that time. This seems like it would create a new block baiting meta. As an old man gamer out of my s let me say that I have not been this hooked to a game instantly since CS gold came out as a mod. I remember when the M had a ACOG. Look forward to the future iterations stay Agile. ,survivetheculling,dc34rz7,1,t5_3cavp

Thanks for sharing this time but I suggest go back to stagger and play around with stagger times if it means so much to you that  of your time in a fight is stunned  btw I dont mind that it amps me up and increases suspension and actually gives me a chance to look at my HP and enemy HP for example..to name a few other things.

10266031,0,t1_dc2y6nj,Im just confused now what was wrong with the original combat? The only change needed related to the delaytiming of the block and shove for combat.

Airdrops need func rebalancing how do they fix it change the how damn system... people are expecting the patch to fix the game and bring back players.

This is because you outplayed your opponent so this is a good thing.My opinion is that blocking your opponent doesnt reward you enough for two reasons . They can just turn and run away to face no consequences. They can still deal damage to you which is my biggest issue. Now you have to take damage to deal damage even if you outplay your opponent.

10592768,0,t1_dd81bvs,Stamina plays far too big a part in any fight and managing that stamina is a huge part of what plays into skillful play. Look at the combat perks we have for every other weapon currently.Speedy spear Only issue with this is the ability to extend hitboxes further than anyone who does not have a movement speed buff at the time. There is counter play.Brutus  backstab damage I see no issue with this perk in any way except since the big patch backstabs seem to be more prevalent than ever with the strange hitboxes. Either way there is counter play.Basher I see no issue with this perk where it stands.  is completely fair.Golden Arm I personally hate this perk but the amount of skill required to be successful with it validates it and there is counter play.Ranger I have no issues with this perk except if you can find two bows and abuse caltrops you can just bow kite. That being said you could do that without the perk and either way there is counter play.Trapper Map awareness nuff said.Mangler With no stamina stim there is literally no counter play except to simply not get hit. This combat perk has the most devastating effect to an enemy in comparison to any other combat perk we currently have while doing nothing special at all. Look at the detrimental effect lack of stamina has. It removes your ability to jump run as quickly run at all hinders ability to see removes the ability to extend hitboxes. The list goes on you get my point.Now what is my counter play? Stop moving to regain my stamina but if I do that Im easily at a  or higher disadvantage to my opponent because they can run circles around me meanwhile I have to perfectly avoid damage entirely to even regain my stamina and any combat ability I am using will stop my stamina regeneration. So in essence if they have managed to get my stamina below  which is extremely likely I have zero counter play. Caltrops wont give me distance smoke bombs wont give me ENOUGH distance to matter golden arm is completely countered because you need stamina to create distance for it to be viable at all. I challenge you to look at any other combat perk and tell me which one counters it or at least has a counter capability.EDIT I will have to take some time to think as to what could replace mangler.,survivetheculling,dd8k8yd,1,t5_3cavp

10664018,0,t1_ddfo7f9,gtSpear Spear wound does extra damage to armor and helps some of your damage pierce through armor. This translates to extra damage but only sometimes. Why run that when you can get extra damage all the time with an axe?When do you find people without armor that you arent vulturing? And if they dont have armor you should be at a significant advantage because you should have armor. And why would you run it? Because when you get a jab in with expose on someone with armor and get a jab in with a spear on someone with armor in terms of damage dealt through the pierce wound you get significantly more out of the spear than the ax.gtBlades Bleed over time is strong if you can kite around and drain your opponent. But you can get that damage up front with axes instead of waiting around. I suspect blades might be more useful in v situations but I mostly play teams.Blades are weak it is known.gtBludgeons Bludgeons slow you down allowing you to get more hits on your target because they cant run. This is something that axes cant do unless you take mangler in which case its at least even with the cripple effect from bludgeon and arguably better because now you get extra damage AND a slowing effect.You...dont get a slowing effect...you gain the ability to catch them over time but they can create distance still and nothing is stopping them from that.Personally I find bludgeons and axes with mangler to be roughly on the same level spears are very slightly behind them and blades are the weakest. Why?Well I feel the ability to lock someone down now outweighs the benefit the extra damage and chasing ability that an ax with mangler gets you. People really underestimate the importance of mobility and finishing fights quicklyas to avoid vultures. Spears are invaluable against armor but personally I feel I can find other ways to shred their armor and hang on the the effectiveness of one of the other two wounds. Explosives and bow kiting is an example of ways to drop their armor before engaging directly.Blades...theres no real way to successfully kite your opponent like there used to be. Bleeding someone out was viable when you could actually outrun them but thats not really the case. On top of that it leaves you exposed to vultures because fights last longer.I prefer bludgeons because I want to be able to lock my opponents in place and Im confident that I can beat pretty much anyone in the game outside of one person. Axes are good too but I hate chasing people only reason I dont use them. I know many good players that use spears and prefer the ability to shred armor over catching someone or locking them down. Blades again are the only weapon type that isnt really used.Ive seen every iteration of the game and played every one extensively outside of blades wounds are in the most balanced state Ive ever seen them you can make an argument to get each type of drop. Im sorry you got bodied by someone that had an ax but if they  shotted you then you would have gotten bodied anyways.,survivetheculling,ddfwufi,1,t5_3cavp

10921739,0,t1_de6giwk,No progress whatsoever you really are ignorant.The past year has been dedicated around trying to perfect its main mechanic combat so that smaller aspects of the game maps skins game modes can be focused on. You need a main structure first and if that isnt perfected in some way nothing else can be worked on.Plus a BattleRoyale focused game cant really have much more content than yknow...killing each other with weapons....What more do you want? The only thing I can see them adding is more maps eventstraps and itemsskins. The latter of which is insignificant.Nobody here cares about content coming right away we care about combat the essential element of the game being fixed and perfected to a point where the majority of the players are satisfied. That is top priority.,survivetheculling,de6i1we,0,t5_3cavp

11294271,0,t3_612flo,The game is screwed because they listened to every cry baby player and changed everything people complained about. They lost me back when they nerfed golden arm. In my opinion the game needs to go back to the start at the point where they addressed the tazerbackstabbing thing. That was game breaking and took no skill. Put it back to that point and stop listening to all the cry babies complaining about every little thing in the game.I played  hrs when the game got released and have not played it since the first golden arm nerfs.The game was at its best just after you addressed the tazerbackstab problem but before you nerfed golden arm to shit. Stop listening to all the cry babies because its turned the game to shit. It didnt need heavy balancing it just needed new mapsweaponsskins back when I played it.It had a good following on twitch because the game was good that probably made more sales and now look at it.,survivetheculling,dfc6txc,3,t5_3cavp

11452757,0,t3_62ypno,Combat. With block stagger coming back into play thank God there will still be problems to deal with. Block baiting constantly block cancel block cancel repeat will become prevent again without something in place to prevent it. Also no one likes jab back so these block stagger changes need to be precise to avoid jab back returning to play. To me these are the only big problems with block stagger.Also remove the auto throw on charge attacks and just add back in stamina use on combat actions. Make holding a charge attack past  or  seconds PUNISHING on stamina like  stam a second after that. Then countering a person holding a charge is as easy as hold block and keep backing up. They will either throw to conserve stam or hold lose all their stam and now you have the advantage in the fight over them. Does not seem like a hard problem to solve for all the combat changes we have been getting just to solve this hold charge vs hold block stalemate dilemma.Random Factor. This game lost so much of it. Blue crates airdrop paths armor and tier s in lockers tier s in blue cratesholos tier s in red crates there used to be so many things that were unexpected that could happen. Im not saying it was balanced or that some of the changes were bad like tier s in reds was a little overkill but it made every match very random. Different weapon types more movement around the map shooting down airdrops to steal other players builds lots of random factors at play and it added to the suspense and to the feel and uniqueness of the game a lot. Maybe dont bring some of these back but start incorporating more random factor to the game that isnt just in map events.Remove Dig Deep. My God it is just pure antifun. No one likes dealing with it hell I hate using it because it likes to proc itself with no sound effect so I die going Oh I guess my dig deep proced already...that sucks. Such an annoying perk to use takes away TONS of other viable options of survival perks and annoying perk to fight against Oh boy my enemy has more health than me AND will survive a explosion if I try to finish him off with one. Not to mention it EXISTING is making blade meta a thing right now. Bleed triggers dig deep and provides good damage where axes are just good damage without triggering dig deep. And I see plenty blade users this patch even with dig deep giving back  hp. You can argue the perk isnt over powered any more but God you cant argue it is a fun and healthy perk for the game because it just isnt.FUNC and Stamina. Im not gonna get into much detail but both of these mechanics worked in a more effective and impactful ways in the past. Make FUNC costs and sell prices vary again and balance it. It was already pretty balanced before and then thrown in the trash for this bland everything sells for  func all holos are  func boring crap. Stamina Ive already touched on a little in combat needs to come back for combat actions. Maybe make certain successful combat actions refund stamina? Idk but no stam costs just added more problems to the game than it fixed so many fight while running half way accross the map fights which leads to vulture kills ugh and stam costs in the game previously helped deal with a couple small combat problems like charge attacks and bow kiting. It also raised the skill ceiling without creating a big barrier for entry for newbies. Pros learned how to manage stam in combat effectively and prosper newbies learn over a few matchs that zero stam means you cant escape or fight back well and learn pretty fast to not drop to low stam.  It worked it was great and I think it had a lot of room to implement new perks and ideas before all combat actions became free.,survivetheculling,dfu5teh,4,t5_3cavp
11561979,0,t1_dg6jlav,They didnt advertised it? Are you kidding me? Every big streamer was playing the game when it came out. They gave out a ton of keys. It was a unique game. Now its just one of many battle royale games.And when I look at games like battleground that have way more content at the start. Not like the culling. That has only two little maps a few weapons and really bad combat. They did nearly nothing in this  years. And even games like Dayz that did equaly shitty have still thousands of players. While the culling has ,survivetheculling,dg6jzly,5,t5_3cavp

11736689,1,t1_dgqax6j,I wish they made the prison map be during the day I really hate playing on it. And its not even like the map itself is bad its just how dark is it for no reason at all. Doesnt even add anything to the stealth element.,survivetheculling,dgqdtcf,-1,t5_3cavp
11738711,0,t1_dgqk7cc,I think the problem is that the prison map feels like the devs rushed the development   the map is not balanced    the graphic assets are mostly recycled    the middle is clustered with uninspiring boring buildings    actually the map doesnt look like a prison the first thing i thought playing the map its a small town or shopping mall   overall quality seems low in comparison to the island     shake and bake has sun burning colour really? not even changed colours to some moonlight colour?   no tiny details polished or special buildings  The fact that the map is a night map is actually unimportant its the quality that makes the map boring.,survivetheculling,dgqm2mw,9,t5_3cavp
