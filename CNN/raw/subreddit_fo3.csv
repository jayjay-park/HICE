2326765,0,t3_2lw8v0,There are some mods that require other files for them to be able to work such as DLC other mods etc and thats where I ran into every single one of my crashes. Load order was fine used FOEdit and it tells you which file it was trying to load and what was missing for the mod to work. Do you DL from NexusMods? They usually tell you the other mods required for a mod to work. Hope this helps!,fo3,clzauvu,1,t5_2tu0k

4233429,0,t1_cs2otlr,Corrupted saves happen occasionally thats why its important to have multiple rolling save points and not just rely on quicksaves and autosaves. A good mod for doing this without thinking about it is CASM I linked the New Vegas one because you mentioned OWB Even though this is posted in FO.FUBAR mentioned that they removed some mods and it solved their issue with further corrupted saves though it will not help you recover an already corrupted one.,fo3,cs2sqze,1,t5_2tu0k

I would play Fallout  for sure its a very special game. There are some elements from  that look to be going into . Since  takes place in Boston it will involve the Commonwealth PostWar Massachusetts and most likely The Institute a technological organization with the ability to create androids both of which were mentioned and alluded to in Fallout .,fo3,cs7migo,2,t5_2tu0k

We had a user harassing people in another fallout sub one specific example related to my nipples evading bans with alts and brigading and a single barelyrelated account that was  hours old was shadowbanned. Thats all that was done. Thats unacceptable. This isnt about AMAs but firing Victoria was the last straw.

5788980,0,t3_3u4993,When it comes to terminals dont use up all attempts to hack into it if you mess up on the last attempt youll get locked out and the only way to get into the safeterminaletc would be to find a keyif theere is one or get a perk that allows you to retry the hacking  forgot the name of the perk but the perk that allows you to do that takes a while to get depending on how you allocate level points or whatever its called when you level up.Also its best if you find a place to dump stuff find moriartys saloon at Megaton and find Nova so you can rent a room in the room theres a cupboard that you can use to store stuff as a word of caution leave the rooms door open at all times that way you wont have to pay rent again for the room so you access your stuff easily. ,fo3,cxeoeeg,2,t5_2tu0k

In  a ton of your backstory is already written. Backstory spoilers maybe Mom died as she gave birth to you youre from Vault  youve lived there your whole life etc.spoiler In NV youre a courier who while delivering a package gets shot in the head.

7133759,0,t3_4d9fex,When Fallout  was released I was one of those NMA trolls who just flooded forums about how Fallout  is Oblivion with guns and how Fallout  is basically Call of Duty then I actually bought the game and... Well I think I have more than  hours in it total over the years still playing every once in a while and have over  downloads for my mods at Nexus.  To be fair I would have never enjoyed this game that long without mods but only things where I absolutely need mods to enjoy the game are mechanical aspects like bugfixes more difficulty and iron sights. My game is predominantly vanilla or should I say vanilladerived and Im enjoying it all the same.,fo3,d1p12gg,10,t5_2tu0k
7156144,0,t1_d1rj45j,I think it depends. Every game is the very best looking it possibly could be but newer games may take longer to create thus they have less time to spend on the important parts.  Morrowind just had such an excellent story and was very difficult to get the hang of so it felt like a really deep game. Skyrim looked amazing but the story kinda sucked and the controls and gameplay were extremely simple. But then you get in and see that you can read every single book and you explore this vast space and it evens out. ,fo3,d1rl0qp,1,t5_2tu0k
