4189809,0,t1_crxtrij,Well  I dont really think that there is that many actual hentai anime. There are just normal SoLs then you got the fanservicetype of SoLs then hentai anime. Hentai is the thing that people know look out for and its very synonymous with anime. Thus hentai anime are more wellknown by Outsiders and nonhentai anime are less popular  and sometimes mistaken for being hentai probably due to fan service scenes and NSFW fan art. If youre someone with decent experience in anime youll know that there seems to be less hentai than regular anime.Either that or its probably more easy to sell and more easy to create. Just grab a girl with the assets that you want slap on some useless plot put in the stuff that is going to have sex with the girl then add fan service and sex scenes make them as good as your imagination fetish and the law can go then  youre done. Simple as that. It really doesnt take that much to make hentai and it takes lesser to sell it  unless youre blocked by the law. Either way there will be a lot of attracted people  those who use it those whore aroused by it and other types of people. ,TheArtifice,crxu6lz,1,t5_32bjk
