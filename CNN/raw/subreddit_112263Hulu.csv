6667851,0,t1_d090d75, the biggest disappointment for me is not having multiple resets. I am still very much enjoying the show though I think it holds up on its own very well. Lets not pretend its like under the dome it is much much better,112263Hulu,d090hww,12,t5_3arpq

6718017,0,t3_47n9xg,.. will roll out on Hulu one episode per week as it has for other original series but even if you find yourself watching a few installments of the show backtoback this is a credits sequence that may end up being worth paying close attention to every time. The makers of the time travel series had some fun with tweaking the titles a bit for each episode so you can see if you notice little changes each week. Where will those changes show up? Hint Pay close attention to the suitcase and the clock. And to the doorstep of Als Diner in the second episode which depicts the events of a fateful Halloween night.Source ,112263Hulu,d0e78z5,5,t5_3arpq

6985364,0,t1_d17mg8m,gt I was fairly interested to see how he would get himself out of that situation. Unfortunately they didnt show or explain it.Its not that hard. Just something like   Close your eyes and count to  dont open them until then or Ill fucking kill you. Were watching.,112263Hulu,d184qea,16,t5_3arpq

7164092,0,t3_4dfjld,During the closing credits of episode  I noticed credits for Sadies cousin  and Sadies cousin  but didnt think much about it at the time. I just thought it was a little weird because I didnt remember anything with her cousins in that episode. I havent thought about it since then until I saw this picture. Good catch!,112263Hulu,d1shltg,1,t5_3arpq
7196232,0,t3_4dy1ln,Oh man. You got that right! This will stick with me for forever no doubt. The book is amazing and im re reading it now but to be able to put faces on those characters brings it to a whole new level. I could really feel the chemistry between Jake amp Sadie for me James amp Sarah went perfectly together. Its Saturday morning here and I still cant get it out of my head. Feel like I have PTSD for Jake and Sadie lol. Beautiful poignant but so heartbreaking. Nothing has ever punched me in the feels like this show amp the book has and never will. Its so much deeper than your usual love story with tragedy. Wow. Ive been sitting here watching some scenes from past episodes this morning and I came upon this... Realized the same music plays when Jake sees Sadie in the bus station in the finale... And I have been punched in the feels again. This show combined with re reading the book is going to make me have to see a shrink lol. Absolutely amazing that they brought those emotions out in all of us. Wow. ,112263Hulu,d1w5ic9,5,t5_3arpq
7212171,0,t1_d1hjoar,What was the point of Bill? Why write him into the series just to kill him off? He didnt do anything besides listen to the oswalds and point guns at Jake. His character could have been replaced by Jake listening to the recordings. ,112263Hulu,d1xyuij,1,t5_3arpq
7222777,0,t1_d1z5tpn,gthed be half a world away from his reset time portalI think this is the real reason. Texas is already pretty far... but if stuff went wrong in Russia hed be right screwed. For the other concerns... not speaking Russian is the biggest one by far I think. As far as not knowing the geography etc hes from  its hard to underestimate the impact satellite imagery on finding routes into Russia in  not to mention all of the other information we have in hindsight.You mentioned earlier about getting into Canada and Mexico from the US those are both easy to do legally or illegally in  let alone . ,112263Hulu,d1z6bjl,2,t5_3arpq

7374822,0,t3_4g2o9b,I think part of it is Bill wasnt the same character in the book that he was in the show. In my opinion they didnt respect the book until the last few episodes.

10049219,0,t3_5jkn31,Very insightful post. I fully agree. After you talk about it it makes complete sense. Sadie is basically a perfect woman for the s. Heck to me shes beyond perfect in todays world too. Her sense of loyalty and good values are hard to come by in the world today. To me Sadie is a dream girl and any man would be lucky to find himself a Sadie.Also I am right there with you after watching this show I began to realize how much I would have loved to live in the s and early s it was such a simpler time and a very exciting time too. Nowadays things are so sexualized and everything and I really prefer the simplicity and cleanliness of the s and early s.,112263Hulu,dbhft1v,3,t5_3arpq
10862524,0,t1_d8mdcoo,gt  Sometimes things need to be cut for time constraints and I feel like the people who made the show made the right choices.Id be inclined to agree except that Bill received a lot of screen time that could have been allotted to make a better television adaptation. IMO he pretty much made the series unwatchable. ,112263Hulu,de0e5e8,1,t5_3arpq
