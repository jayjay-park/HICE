1372869,0,t3_29tnn1,Ugh this must be a phase they go through. I seriously could have written this minus the son. She has never used her crib and we dont plan on using it until our second kid shell be in a toddler bed once we move in October. I use it for time outs when she gets too bad. Ill give her a firm no and then explain why I said no like No Adalyn. Its not nice to hit mommy. Then if she continues Ill give her a verbal warning for time out. If shes still being rotten she goes in time out for  minutes to calm down.Usually shell be fine once shes cooled down and shell tell me oh no sorry. when I pick her up.,beyondbaby,ciodku6,2,t5_32fgh

1404227,0,t3_2a7cvy,I used to use an old waste basket as a recycle bin until my daughter started screaming one day in the kitchen.  I ran in to find her with her fingers caught in a tin can...the lid was still attached and she got her fingers stuck.  Managed to get her fingers out without any blood but scared the crap out of me.  Bought a new bin with a lid that day.,beyondbaby,cisata6,1,t5_32fgh

1496167,0,t3_2bbfnh,Kids are interested in their body. Its not a sexual thing its a discovery thing.  Dont stress about it. As he gets older just explain that its a private time thing.  My daughter is  and knows that her discovery tine is a bath time thing or a bed time thing. Its OK to check your body parts out but its polite to do it in private ,beyondbaby,cj3tiah,2,t5_32fgh
1519629,0,t1_cj6qxnl,He naps with loads of white noise and fans. If hes solo its in a pack and play in our room. He falls asleep by himself just fine there but just cant get over that  minute hump. Weirdly he wont fall asleep for naps in his crib meanwhile at bedtime he happily konks out there. Bizarre. I guess I should try shushing and patting more. I feel silly for not trying that! Hes asleep by  the latest. Hes exhausted by then. Bedtime is smooth so Im worried to change it. Although he IS an early riser... hmm... damn you sleep always making me second guess everything!,beyondbaby,cj6rgli,1,t5_32fgh
1669492,0,t3_2de8uu,Youre insane!!!! My SOs dog is  and hes on the hunt for a puppy. I keep telling him no freaking way. He works  hours a day five days a week and is gone overnight two nights during that. It would be me stuck training the puppy and I am decidedly not an animal lover. However puppies are super cute! Good luck!,beyondbaby,cjplnii,1,t5_32fgh

2283153,0,t3_2le2s4,Wow that sounds frustrating. I know a lot of doctors wont do allergy testing that young but I do know a little boy who had severe seasonal allergies that most definitely manifested at that age body rash coupled with longterm cough. Personally I guess Id probably try to get another opinion if its at all possible. ,beyondbaby,cltwy7t,2,t5_32fgh

3026535,0,t3_2umw3b,Im so sorry this happened to you! I can definitely relate. I guess I would probably feel differently if this happened to my son since I was bit as a toddler. I have no memory of it but I do have a permanent scar on my nose because of it. If one of our dogs ever did this they too would be gone. I am so sorry this may not be the comfort you were looking for but I would definitely be more worried for my sons safety than worried about the dog.,beyondbaby,cobp595,1,t5_32fgh
3047042,0,t1_codq1my,I followed him around the other day as he did laps around the upstairs every time he went into a new room or hallway he would jump the threshold so I did the same.  Yeah after  minutes I was done... If I had shoes on it would have been better but you are right they are a ball of energy.,beyondbaby,codtpqe,1,t5_32fgh

3543648,0,t1_cpw3kdi,Im hoping to quit pumping soon but he has cows milk and soy intolerance so Ive waited.  Hoping to get my body back in that regard soon.I didnt look into the bottle thing too much since mine transitioned really easily to the sippy though Ive been reading that a sippy isnt that much better than a bottle.  Hopefully the transition goes well.  I was worried to do just sippy since with water he would usually take a mouth full then let it dribble down is front.  I was pretty surprised that he never did that with the milk.  ,beyondbaby,cpw75ss,1,t5_32fgh
3591583,0,t3_310xek,I think the thing that helped us most throughout his early life was being open with what the toilet is for and explaining what was happening when we were in there together.  We played it by ear to begin with.  We started with a potty he could sit on and progressed after about  months to a potty seat which he uses all the time now.  I think its important to know that accidents will happen and some days there wont be any while other days there will be a lot.  My son will be  in June and is  potty trained.  He still wears a pullup at night time.  ,beyondbaby,cq1o24d,1,t5_32fgh
5021613,0,t3_3jock4,We had to get this water visor to be able to watch our daughters hair. She has sensitive ears and doesnt like water near them or in her face just like me in that regard but Im an adult and got over it. My daughter is . years old and has a huge head and this fits her. It basically solved the problem although sometimes it isnt snug enough and will let water through so I use one hand to control the shower head it has a long tube and use the other hand to hold the visor firmly against her head. ,beyondbaby,curao4n,2,t5_32fgh
