4166586,0,t1_crv4i0v,Every days a school day thanks for the links  Whilst it sounds like there are people working on supporting InstantGoConnectedStandby in the Linux kernel it also sounds like its a way off I couldnt find much material on the subject more recent than the link above.Given that the SP boots very quickly anyway I might look at configuring it to enter hibernate After n minutes of inactivity When the lid is closed When the power button is pressedWhilst not ideal a  second boot up time is preferable for me at least to instantly starting up only to tell me my batter is about to die One avenue of hope could be Intel Rapid Start technology which could possibly be enabled in linux  That said I need to do some digging to find if the SP supports it and what the inevitable gotchas are.,SurfaceLinux,crv76cw,1,t5_2w9ps

9691136,0,t1_da7l2g7,Okay may have been a bit hasty so heres the situationYes detaching and reattaching works. Keyboard is aokay with it however there is some issue with the touchpad and the touch functionality when reattaching and Ive seen it occasionally at other times the touchpad starts registering two fingers as one so ie. three fingers to two finger scroll screen doesnt autorotate. The pen works with the buttons but its not really stable it has issues like the touchpad where its ability to click seems to mess up even though digitizer is still working. But touch itself seems better anddoesnt seem to be impacted when the pen is messing up.Its janky but its usually pretty good. It is frustrating that its just not there yet though and Id really like to run Linux smoothly on the Surface Book. At least the core hardware support is there and if you forgo the touch input I think it actually is pretty reliable currently.,SurfaceLinux,da7mzbh,1,t5_2w9ps

You place the recovery files on a USB drive they have instructions on the download page put it in your S then press vol up or vol down? Opposite of BIOS and power and itll boot into recovery. ,SurfaceLinux,dcznybn,1,t5_2w9ps

10899435,0,t1_de3tw6c,Hey thanks for the reply!So how do I go about applying the patch? Just edit the affected files by hand and addremove the marked lines? Or is there a way to apply the patch file automatically? gt  also seems the Manjaro team is working on getting this patched in the official kernels You mean the multitouch support? That sounds awesome do you have a source on that?Either way thanks for the help! I think I know how to go about this now even tough I still have to figure out how to properly apply the patch without breaking things.Update I got it! The kernel has been compiled and installed  it works perfectly. I ended up manually modifying each file as needed but it worked out just fine. Thanks for your help ,SurfaceLinux,de476p5,1,t5_2w9ps

11049773,0,t3_5x2jkb,TLDR This is just a little update to say I had  success with Ubuntu ...I nuked windows.I installed Debian  jessie. Surprisingly the type cover worked even in grub out of the box even in the GRUB menu.Then I ran upgrade distupgrade via a USB ethernet adaptor and network cable. It came with an old . kernel.Wifi didnt work clicking and dragging was not possible by holding the left trackpad button.I installed the . backport kernel and then I think there were issues with the trackpad or something after that. I gave up on Debian Jessie. I guess its old.Ubuntu .. and .. worked out of the box including wifi and click drag on the touch pad.I installed ubuntu it completed successfully and the system is working nicely.The only problem is displayport didnt work but Ill post a diff thread for that.,SurfaceLinux,dekh10j,1,t5_2w9ps

11759842,0,t3_67m5v0,Yes It is possible to dual boot on the sp but I dont know if it is possible to do so on the sd card. I installed Ubuntu Budgie . recently on to the hard drive but couldnt get grub to work properly. In the end had to install refind to get the os selection screen at boot which works with secure boot.The only thing that seem to not work on Ubuntu budgie was multitouch both the typecover  and the pen worked out of the box no patching necessary.,SurfaceLinux,dgt0al6,1,t5_2w9ps
