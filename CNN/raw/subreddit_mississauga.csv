I didnt have valid identification on my own person until I was seventeen and got my DL.gt I dont think the city aquatics manager would have apologized if the lifeguards had been appropriate in communicating with Dawood. Engh. I have to disagree. Most establishments apologize regardless of faultaction to appease the public. Its small scale but when I worked at Tim Hortons my assistant manager would apologize to customers and fix our mistakes even when none was made. The best example is a customer wanted cinnamon buns for the price of donuts and thats just... Not gonna happen. So she complained to my manager he apologized gave her the buns for the price of donuts and gave her a complimentary Tim card for her trouble.

She seemed really nice and my husband even removed snow from their driveway many times to help her out and some other help too like helping her bring out her garbage a couple of times etc.  One time I found her and her very elderly mother dragging out a door from her house that they were going to leave curbside for garbage and I helped them and said you should have let your son do this and at that point she opened up to me and told me how she pretty much cant rely on him to help with anything and that she regrets letting him come stay and how its her house and not his is any way etc etc.  She also got friendly with my dad and told him a few things like how she was thinking of flipping the house and how her daughter in law basically said when you sell it how much money are we getting despite the fact that they didnt pay for the house at all etc.Early on we didnt see the son much at all but eventually we started seeing him more and more.   One day he was spray painting stuff in the driveway on a windy day and my dad told him he was going to get paint on our cars and he went mental on my dad.  Hes East Indian and thinks hes gangsta and we have had nothing but problems with him since.   He yells and threatens like a fucking psychopath at everything and anything like our car being too close to the median of our shared driveway he freaked out and threatened us about getting our roof done or else he would call the city while we were waiting out an insurance issue etc etc.  Hes a complete psycho and his mom has basically disappeared I never see her anymore.  I think I saw her in passing one day leaving in her car but that is all.  I fucking hate this moron and am done with it.  Also with the renos they have been done next door they have released a mouse infestation that has come over here and we are battling mice as well as morons!  Very fucking frustrated.,mississauga,dc5pi7c,13,t5_2rgmj

10497372,0,t3_5qbwkl,HelloI own a condo in the Square One core. The condo is run very well and we havent had any issues but in two years weve had some serious increases to our maintenance fees. The condo is now  years old so its still young. When we first moved in our maintenance fees were  a month then the next year they went to  a month and now theyre  a month.They have lots in the reserve fund why do they need to keep increasing the maintenance fees? I only plan to stay another year if this happens. I dont want difficulties trying to sell the place.EDIT I meant  a month now not ,mississauga,dcxzkdy,2,t5_2rgmj

10953009,0,t3_5va2o1,This happened to me at Anytime Fitness. Unfortunately it was in the contract and I tried to argue with the girl because she never told me about it when I signed up and i stressed the importance of our verbal agreement and she said nobody cares about he said she said you signed the contract so pay itThings escalated further i talked to the owner different owner now...surprise and it was just a way to scam people...but i ended up paying for it and left the gym as soon as my contract finished.BTW the girl was such a piece of shit liar.....she told me in front of my friend because i had told her i will be paying cash that dont worry we only need your credit card so that i can sign you up but it wont ever be charged and you can make cash payments in personwell they charged me  x  double because i had put a friend under me...and obviously i was furiousalmost got my dads friend lawyer involved but my dad convinced me to just pay it and learn the lesson and move on....MORAL of the story read the contract carefully even if its  pages long...and for gyms never ever give your credit card just do a lumpsum upfront deal like  for  months or whatever. Or even  for  months cash. That has worked better for me and i will continue to do it that way even if i pay a little extra. ,mississauga,de9q41h,1,t5_2rgmj

11316097,0,t1_dfekb2q,I am unaware as to why both subsections are worded the way they are I did not write them.Once again I never said they were the same. Im not sure why you keep insisting I did. I stated that a yellow Amber light means stop. If you check the definition posted again taken directly from the  version of the Highway Traffic Act law enforcement edition you will see both definitions state that the driver shall stop. Shall. Not maybe or optional.The obvious difference between the two is that the Amber light definition includes the sentence if safe to do so the purpose for this little piece on the end does allow drivers to legally pass through an Amber light ONLY if it is unsafe to stop. I dont see any potential safety concerns in this video. Dry roads very little traffic well lit with clear visibility no one travelling behind him. The car in the lane beside him had plenty of time to stop safely.There is no such thing as a caution light in the Highway Traffic Act and as such your madeup definition suggesting to slow down and proceed when clear is not accurate. Snow plows use blue lights and emergency vehicles Police Fire Ambulance use red lights.Im getting tired of going in circles trying to explain this to you. If you dont believe me try it in front of a cop. The ticket for Amber Light Fail to Stop is  and  points. Let me know how it goes.,mississauga,dfentfj,-1,t5_2rgmj

For example I know for a fact that there are only two genders not dozens of made up ones. To say there are is to take a shit on basic biology and science.

11477282,0,t1_dfwn86y,Yeah and she will lose.No professional lawyer or engineer should have become involved in this.To be perfectly clear the lighting at that intersection is sub par. I live a stones throw from that intersection and drive through it multiple times every day. I drove through it heading eastbound about half an hour before she was hit and it was pitch black I recall being nearly blinded by the headlights of westbound traffic.However there are thousands of poorly lit intersections in this city and many thousands more in the countryside. Somehow pedestrians manage to avoid being hit at those even more poorly lit intersections without issue. I strongly suspect that traffic lights and pedestrian walk signals that are designed to be clearly visible in all lighting conditions may play a part.,mississauga,dfwy277,2,t5_2rgmj
