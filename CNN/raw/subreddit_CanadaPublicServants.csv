9257649,0,t3_576m7c,Ask nicely and see whether they change their mind or not?I just completed a round of interviews for a couple of COOP positions. When we interview students we have to run a tight ship. We cant start to accommodate all the requests. Plus this selection process was targeted at a few universities.If your selection process was open to the public you can expect dozens of applicants so dozens of phone interviews to do.,CanadaPublicServants,d8ph2d7,3,t5_3f8vd

9938172,0,t1_db2x5zw,gt Are PSAC employees worse treated than PIPSC? What are the major differences between the two unions?Speaking in generalities ... PSAC amp PIPSC are the  largest unions in the PS.  They are largely treated the same becauuuuuse its like the auto workers.  Once the first agreement is settled that pretty much sets the pattern for all the agreements.  Usually its PSAC that settles first and theyre larger than PSAC btw and basically sets the agreements for everyone else.,CanadaPublicServants,db2ywbz,3,t5_3f8vd

Can honestly say I never asked an employer what health care coverage they provided or what kind of raises they gave out.That sounds very publicsectorish.

10882333,0,t1_de2dcn5,This is really dependent on the departmentagency you work for. Some are using Peoplesoft . some are using MyGCHR which is a customized Peoplesoft . hosted by PSPC and some are using another kind of HR information management system. Both versions of Peoplesoft . and . integrate with Phoenix and should allow for address updates to be done via selfservice. For organizations using a different system HR is probably the best place to ask. ,CanadaPublicServants,de2foja,2,t5_3f8vd

11127570,0,t1_dest2tk,I guess my idea or initiative is more of an initiative to fix what is causing bad morale rather than an initiative to cheer people up and make them think we care.  Management in general seems like they can never acknowledge those issues though because they dont want to take any responsibility for  it. They would rather talk about how great everything is and how they should get credit for it.Ex The respect isnt there and they arent willing to listen to those at the bottom. Thats the type of issue that needs to be addressed to improve morale not casual Friday or free popsicles.,CanadaPublicServants,detaty0,2,t5_3f8vd

CRA afaik were the ones to pioneer that equivalency and was done to broaden the available talent pool at the director level.  With CSs you generally have to have postsecondary in IT IM or related field for education.  By going with an EX the post secondary can be any field ... ie Carly Fiorina and her BA in philosophy and medieval history.,CanadaPublicServants,dg3r6jt,2,t5_3f8vd
