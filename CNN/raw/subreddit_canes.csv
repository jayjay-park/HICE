You cant stop playing Khudobin not even for Ward. Not a good way to show confidence in either goalie.

431697,0,t1_cfpg835,Yea I think they know the troubles.  Showing my disappointment is primarily for management.  I wholly believe this roster is more than playoff capable.  I think JR has made his mistakes.  Letting Seidenberg go.  Letting Bryan Allen go.  Not retaining Whitney even though I dont remember all the deets of that situ Not being aware of Pitkanens progress or lack of and I know his hands were tied financially and I know hes had his successes as well.  I think Muller is too soft and not fiery enough to motivate this team.  Muller was lauded for his work on Montreals power play hows that working now?  Jeff Daniels in Charlottes job is to prepare players for the NHL who has Charlotte delivered lately?  Skinner? No.  Faulk?  No.  Bowman?  Bust.  Boychuk?  Bust.  Dalpe?  Bust.  Brett Carson?  Bust.  Bryan Rodney?  No.  Jamie McBain?  Lol.  They cant even claim Brandon Sutter as he only played  games over a few years.  Brett Bellemore and Patrick Dwyer ladies and gentlemen.  Thats about it.  Im not simply looking at the standings and thinking brown bag.  Im looking at a  straight years of no playoffs.  Im seeing Columbus ranked ahead of us then I compare rosters then I grab my brown bag.  For those asking why Im even going I have a friend from Jersey whom I met down here.  Hes a NYR fan and he comes down for a game each year.  We have free tickets otherwise I would not be going.  And dont get me wrong Ill enjoy the game Ill cheer when we score but this is an area where college teams rule and for the most part the teams are quite successful.  People are not going to support a loser here.  Im as heartbroken as everyone else here I just want to make sure Jim Rutherford and the Karmanos folks know that I want more.  If youre gonna be bad team at least be passionate about it.  Last night was a HUGE game!  Here let me quote Muller following that loss That was a complete solid game on our part for  minutes. We did everything we had to do.  Are you fucking kidding me?  Did he even watch the game?  The players and staff are far to comfortable here.

1406382,0,t3_2a630l,Why is everyone in this sub convinced that we were the worst team in the NHL?  How many times do I need to remind people that we were  points out of the playoffs and  points behind the Eastern Conference champs? When PK and Francis say we are only a few small pieces away they arent lying. We dont need a Buffaloesqe rebuild. We have a solid core of players. Last season we were relying on Justin Peters for a month we lost Pitkanen for the season which was a big piece of our Defenseno matter how much you hate him. Are we gonna win the cup next year Probably not. Will we make the playoffs? yeah we have a good chance of that. Last season the players slacked off and thats why we sucked. Now hopefully HammerHands Peters will bench the players who are half assing it.  STOP SAYING WE ARE SUCKING FOR MCDAVID. WE ARE NOT THE WORST TEAM IN THE LEAGUE. SHOW SOME FUCKIN CONFIDENCE IN OUR BRAND NEW GM.         Looking at the roster I think the GleasonMurphy pair will be a good thing for the team. Murphy has all the offensive skills but gets beat in his own zone or caught pinching. Gleason will stay at home and cover up for a lot of Murphys mistakes.,canes,ciskj0j,11,t5_2rps9

1894506,0,t3_2gb2ig,. I think we underachieved throughout Mullers tenure as HC.   . I feel good about the offseason. We didnt didnt do much to help in the short term. All the signings were depth players or guys on  way contracts basically. However the changes in the front office and at HC I think will make our team better over the coming years. Manny is obviously who we will miss the most not so much for his playing but off the ice he was just an awesome guy. Personally Im excited to see how Tim Gleason does but we had lots of minor injuries slowing guys down last season.  . Boychuk and Terry should have a chance to crack the roster. Not really rookies but they are the bubble players in my mind.  . I think the preseason games will show how Ward will play this season. If hes on his game its a toss up. If he is still off as he was last season dobby gets the nod.  . I think the knee injury slowed him at the beginning of the year. Smaller injuries to SeminTlusty slowed that line down as a whole. If that line can stay healthy look out.  . Goalies getting injured hurt last season. Also at some point Muller lost the locker room things went downhill from there. Biggest stregth is that we have a pretty solid young core coming up and getting better each season.  . Im hoping that Lindholm is gonna break out by staying in the NHL all season.  . Peters has said all the right things so far. He comes from  really good organizations so I have high expectations.  . Ryan Murphy and Brock McGinn. I think those two are the next guys we will see really make an impact at the NHL level. Murphy we have already seen a lot of. Fleury will be interesting to watch over the next few years.  . I expect to be a playoff team. I think realistically we should be a bubble team.,canes,ckhh89b,1,t5_2rps9

But if we want to base all of our analyisis on  or so preseason games and not take into account any prior seasons Which you said dont matter for some reason then sure Cam looked like he actually knows what hes doing for the first time in  seasons.

7203245,0,t3_4e3s9a,Off the top of my head Ron Francis yes that one replaced Jim Rutherford as GM. Ron is doing a great job.  Bill Peters is the head coach. This was his first second season and I think hes done an incredible job with the cards he was dealt.   The team is definitely in rebuilding we have the youngest average player age or close to it in the league. We did better this year that most people thought we would. For a while we were relatively close to a wild card playoff spot. Its feasible next year if we fix our two biggest issues scoring and goaltending.  Eric Staal was traded to the Rangers and is UFA this summer. I dont think well see him back in the offseason.  Cam Ward is UFA this summer. Who knows what will happen here. Theres a valid case to resign him and theres a valid case to let him walk. Youll have to read other threads for details on our goaltending situation its not looking great as of right now. Probably the biggest area we need to improve on.  IMO others may disagree our best players as of late Skinner Rask Nestrasil Staal Faulk preinjury Hanifin Slavin.  We have a lot of good picks going into the draft due to trades. We have a lot of good prospects and developing players in the minor leagues.  Were not moving to Quebec City no matter what the Canadian media tells you. ,canes,d1wy9kd,3,t5_2rps9

11341349,0,t1_dfhhw9i,I can admit that they were all deserving. When I made this post I had just seen Cardiac Cane tweet about how Skinner not getting the award was an outrage and I was inclined to agree as I had been looking forward to seeing Skinner get some recognition. I quickly looked up who the winners were and posted here.As for the Pens and Hawks comment its literally nothing. If anything I was anticipating answers to my rhetorical question of what else Skinner could have done because in rhockey world the most predictable response is Well he could have played for the Hawks lolol. It was definitely baseless and Id be sorry for saying it if I thought there was any reason to care which I guess others have found more readily than I have.,canes,dfhit5f,1,t5_2rps9

11782114,0,t3_68362r,First Eddie had a bunch of bad luck last year and his struggles were very understandable.  All the good players get into a groove and thrive.  Even when healthy Eddie was given a game every  days and expected to be at top form.  Lets give Peters a lot of blame for that.Secondly concussions are very hard to come out of. You can rehab a knee but much harder to rehab your brain.Third with the Beak as coach just who can excel?  Look at Jake Allen at St. Louis after a couple of months with Marty Brodeur. Personally Im not sure Lack can be a top tier keeper.  He seems to have the reflexes size and talent but is squirrelly at times and you need to be a friggin wall.But I do know Peters didnt help at all with his little tirade.,canes,dgvjh4l,5,t5_2rps9
