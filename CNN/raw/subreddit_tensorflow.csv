The inputs and outputs of the network are images with pixels scaled between  and  but the sum of the pixels isnt normalized to . Do the sum of the pixels have to be normalized in order for binary cross entropy to make sense?,tensorflow,ddyral0,1,t5_3alkk
11017839,0,t3_5x89ut,As far as I know unless you are specifying it the models wont interact while running in parallel big assumption here is that the GPU supports multi threading the same way modern CPUs do.  The only downside is performance.  You may starve one model of resources causing it to take longer than running the two models in series.,tensorflow,deguav9,2,t5_3alkk
11291330,0,t3_612ywd,I was wondering if I can use this to conditionally assign a tensor shape with set shape. Any suggestions?,tensorflow,dfbutp2,1,t5_3alkk
11405538,0,t1_dfoso28,Hey sorry I cant find anything with TF and online learning. Instead Im going to give you some blogs that helped a lot with both deep learning and TF.www.wildml.comwww.machinelearningmastery.com This is not my favourite because it is too technical and lacks a lot of theoritcal details but it can help,tensorflow,dfosxc6,2,t5_3alkk
