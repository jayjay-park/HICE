217823,0,t1_cf2xv7g,It really depends on the color you are using.  I can only speak for the professional colors that I use.

My hairdresser friend recommended that when I was trying to figure out what to do with the red shades it was throwing before I embraced them and went full strawberry red. Bleach baths will definitely gently lift it but they only lift  shades at a time. Thats why it takes so long! Good luck!

862434,0,t3_2404oh,Theres the option of styling it different. Curling it loosely with a wand wouldnt take away anymore length and not burn your ends if you plan on growing it out. Honestly I think you look great either way but its all a matter of how you feel.

1077892,0,t3_26gagm,Ive got dry hair too so once every few weeks I soak my hair in olive oil and put in it a shower cap or plastic bag for at least an hour.  Keeping your hair in a shower cap or plastic bag creates heat and your hair absorbs way more oil.  If you can leave it in overnight.  After washing it ALL out try to focus in on more shampoo to your scalp than to your ends your hair should be smoother.  Also you could be using too much shampoo.  Try using little quarter sized pumps and seeing how far they go.  Try leaving in your conditioner for as long as possible while in the shower.  Good luck!,FancyFollicles,chqt5q5,7,t5_2sa9a

1548641,0,t3_2bxjz7,I third loreal hicolor!  Works amazingly well without damaging your hair to the extreme like straight up bleaching can do.  There are two different sets of colors to choose from  the hicolor highlights which include fire engine red copper and magenta and then the normal hicolor which has several blonde red and brown variants.  Id recommend pairing it with ion sensitive scalp developerpurple bottle which has a much better smell and doesnt hurt sensitive skin.  If you have really dark hair pairing it with the  volume would probably work best as  can be a bit harsh.You can get all of this at a Sallys beauty supply and if you dont have one you can easily order it online.   Just a note though you will still want to deep condition your hair afterwards.  With the hicolor you are still lifting color so you will need a good balance of protein and moisturizing in whatever conditioner you decide on.  Ion also puts out deep conditioning packets which seem to work quite well.  Each packet can be single or double use depending on the length and thickness of your hair.  They have ones that are silicone free if need be.  Good luck ,FancyFollicles,cjae93j,3,t5_2sa9a

I have some blue in the front of my hair but decided I needed more because it looked odd it was just part of the side and half of my bangs. I used Blond Brilliance powder and level  developer for my hair and a mix of powder and level  for my roots. My hair came out light enough to actually dye my hair blue straight away instead of having orange hair and having to go red first. I was astounded not because my hair is almost naturally black but because the new chunk I bleached was previously bleached then dyed black about a year ago. Once this fades I plan on doing a platinum toner also blond brilliance. I know they have a lavender toner but not sure about the results. Plus they were the least harsh bleaching I have ever done. They have coconut oil in them and seem to give me the gentlest but highest lifting results. You can always go back to dark if you dont like having light hair. But since you have already come this far I say keep it or go lighter if you want. You have already done the work or part of it if you go lighter.

2016610,0,t3_2hqqa2,Dark brown nearly black will definitely need to be lightened in some way for the highlights to show. Ive tried burgundy before with not quite as dark brown and got a similar result  just kind of tinted red but not a lush full colour.

2474408,0,t3_2nwgbw,I dont know if youre aware but that is a toner not bleach or developer. It will not on its own give you the color you want to achieve. Not to mention youll have to do some serious bleaching to get your hair a silver tone from black.As for what the color will fade to that depends. You may start to get some yellowing or even a green tone from washing or swimming. That is what the toner is for to maintain the tone. Also keeping a toner on for too long will give you purple toned hair. It will probably wash out but not right away.,FancyFollicles,cmhjjlc,3,t5_2sa9a
2481003,0,t3_2nzocz,Depending upon your original color and the amount of processing done to your hair its worth a call at least.  I do my own hair now thanks to the extensive tutelage of my hairdresser sibling but previous to that when Id spend  for highlights and they didnt turn I would contact the salon.  The last time that happened they reprocessed me for no charge.  Your hair may not have been light enough or may have been damaged.  All hair is different and reacts in different ways.  This very well may have been the case for you.  Lifting agents are completely a results vary mixed bag.Another note  if you dont like your hair in the chair say so.  Nothing pisses off a stylist more than having someone say they like something then complain to a manager over the phone the next day.  It makes them just as uncomfortable to be lied to then have to fake smile back at the customer while they fix their hair.  On that note I use fix very loosely personal opinion is completely subjective when hair is involved.They also may have had you sign a waiver before services as all good salons SHOULD before processing bleach on someone.  If they did you will likely have to pay again.,FancyFollicles,cmielvw,3,t5_2sa9a

2618865,0,t3_2psltz,I agree with lilghost about your hairstylist knowing you. But for people like me I go to GreatClips and whatever person I get I get. So if youre in that case which I assume you are otherwise you wouldnt have run into this problem with a good stylist I would be as descriptive as I can. If you want to make sure you have everything right stop them every few minutes or so to see how its going. Watch them and your hair in the mirror. If they pick up a front lock you want to stay long stop them and say Wait wait. Keep that as long as possible etc. When you walk into any salon you are the boss here. This is your hair. You will get what you want. If you think your hair looks ugly or unacceptable refuse to pay. No one will be happy but at least youre not paying for someone to ruin your hair. And sure they could be judging you for bleaching your own hair who knows? But at least you did it yourself and took initiative to not burn it all off accidentally and you are making it the way you like it. And if that fails to make you confident just tell a white lie and say a stylist did it if it even comes up. Hell if you want to go far enough with a little fib just start saying youre an aspiring hair stylist and want to know the best ways to bleachstyleetc you hair. Although its a lie no one gets hurt and youll most likely never see them again. Of course you should only go that far if you dont feel confident enough about it all...or you jsut want to be an actress for a while PAs for the bleaching. Multiple bleach sessions are good if you want to go white. Especially if you have dark hair. Now you have to do these bleach sessions days apart as to not ruin your hair. I would recommend a session then cover your hair in a conditioning treatment or oil etc. Then wait a day or two at LEAST with more conditioning and oil if you must id recommend it then bleach again. Once its a bit paler go for the toner. If that doesnt work try mixing a tad bit of purple hair colour with a white or clear conditioner and leave that in for a bit making sure to check often so you dont accidentally dye your hair purple. I hope it all works out and sorry for the long post!,FancyFollicles,cn0f9f7,1,t5_2sa9a

I still try to keep the curls at the front of my face going forward at the bottom and away from the face at the top though just to make the look a little more polished.

3508028,0,t3_30fj0h,Well there is always bleach. But bleaching is super damaging and doesnt work how you plan out most times. There are two different ways they could prepare their hair for this. Theres the quick way that is more damaging but they will be able to go pastel within a couple days. Or there is the slow way that will be less damaging but may take weeks. Most brutal way bleaching. Youll need powder bleach and a developer. I would recommend not going above a  volume because the higher the volume the stronger the bleach. And I dont know how sensitive your roomates scalp is so I would suggest a  volume developer. You could just use straight bleach or what I and some other people call a bleach bath where you mix a color stripping shampoo baby shampoo or head and shoulders with bleach and put that in your hair for about  minutes. The more painless on your hair process  they could wash their hair in hot water with baby shampoo or head and shoulders. Those should fade your roomates hair somewhat if not a lot. I know that generally works well for a lot of people. Depending on their hair condition now bleaching may be inevitable. Im going to guess your roomate is a girlsorry if theyre a guy. Her hair will have to be either white or silver to get to pastel dying condition. If she gets her hair to a brassy blonde or ash blonde she should get a purple shampoo to counteract the brassy tones. Then shell need a purplesilver toner to make sure all the hair is for the most part one shade. You cannot have any brassy tones when it comes to pastel or your hair will not turn out pastel. I would suggest a salon because going that light from a dark color can be super damaging to your hair and pastels dont always turn out how you want them to.

3560781,0,t1_cpy2nk3,Demipermanent color is deposit only. Because there is no lift involved in a demi color process a volume developer is used. However a permanent  R with a v would probably work. If you want to stay in your level go demi. It will just add a nice soft red tone to your hair I adore chocolatey cherry coke type browns. If you do want a level lighter though go with the permanent R and v. A v with permanent color will only make your hair darker because color doesnt lift color. ,FancyFollicles,cpy5kp1,1,t5_2sa9a

3578075,0,t1_cpzyozo,I dont want roots so I would rather it just gradually wore off. I like the idea of having the cuticle coated and filled in at weak points. I dont want anything to lift the cuticle though. I havent colored my hair in years because I have porous dry slow growing hair. I read that the super cheap revlon colorsilk is actually pretty good. It says permanent but I read its a semi and uses a low level of peroxide and no ammonia. ,FancyFollicles,cq04n71,-2,t5_2sa9a

3618098,0,t1_cq4jakl,The product you have is not bleach it is what is considered  to be a high lift color meaning it lifts tones and deposits color to prevent unwanted  undertones. The biggest rule of color is that Color Doesnt  Lift Color meaning if you have already colored your hair a dark brown going over it with a light blind color will not remove the dark brown no matter what if you want to be lighter you must use bleach.So yes you need to purchase a powder bleach and I would only recommend  volume developer peroxide.  should not lead to any chemical  burns when applied to the scalp and is safer to do more than once if needed. If you are looking to remove purple I take it you have used a direct dye direct dyes are colors you dont have to mix with a developing agent such as manic panic directions splat pravana ect. Direct dyes do not always lift out of the hair typically. I know from personal  and my professional  experience Ive tried to lift blue that turned cotton candy pink orange that turned neon red green turn gray and more times than not tried to lift a many repeated  color to find my hair was very stained and would not completely  lift out the color without risking serious damage to my hair!Now because you are staying in the cool spectrum purpleblue I personally  wouldnt even do a bleach wash because the colors are so similar unless you are trying to achieve pastels or really  dont want any of the other color showing through.For a bleach wash or soap cap mix your powder bleach and developer as directed by the manufacturer then add an equal part of shampoo or conditioner. I use conditioner because it gives a bit of a cushion to keep the bleach from stressing out my hair too much. And personally if you are only using  volume and only applying to the color you want to remove or your roots I would just use a straight bleach mix and apply evenly where needed.I only ever use bleach washes on super stressed hair or on lifting pastel shades. Otherwise I just use straight bleach because washes can lead to uneven  coverage which leads to uneven lifting and a blotchy mess. Lifting hair is all about application you want to make sure the areas you  want to lift are saturated in a reasonable  amount of time because every  moment lifting is happening. You dont want one side of your head lighter than the other and ready to be washed out before the other!Any other questions  feel free to ask!,FancyFollicles,cq4otnn,1,t5_2sa9a

4129051,0,t3_37yyld,Without knowing your hair type or personal style its tricky to make specific suggestions.  To get it straighter there are a couple of options  tying it all up into a bun will probably be encouraging the waves  so if using hotirons doesnt suit you consider blowdrying it with a good heat defence product particularly one designed for straight styles. This will still be time consuming but will be slightly gentler on your hair assuming you dont wash it every day.To keep it off your face you could tie just the frontside sections back into a ponytail or smaller bun and leave the rest of it loose...

5118295,0,t1_cv2velv,The info below is correct about removing black being a PITA. When I went lighter from black I used Colorfixyou can buy it at Sallys or online. It smells like rotten eggs but its a color remover not bleach. Theres all kinds of info about how to use it online but basically you put it in for  min and then rinse for  no joke. Do three rounds of that spaced out by a few days so you can deep condition its drying. Everything after that depends on how light your base is once the dye is removed. If your hair is naturally pretty dark it wont be much lighter. Colorfix usually leaves me a ginger color. From there I did a bleach with  vol peroxide and then used Punky purple mixed with plum. Note not in any way a stylist this is just what I did. Do your research if you try DIY and go slow. ,FancyFollicles,cv2y2qg,1,t5_2sa9a

Theres a couple ways to do this but in the salon we usually mix a red in with our color formulation. Is there any way you can go to a stylist? If not you can always try Sallys. You can buy boxes of color there and get a red and whatever brown youd like c then developer and all that jazz. Theyd be able to see your hair so they could probably tell you what level you need what filler etc etc.As far as eyebrows I wouldnt use hair color on them.

Its kind of hard to see in this pictures but it was pretty cool in that colors showed up when different light hit my hair. I lasted about a week with silver hair before I chopped the majority off. I grew out my hair for over a year for the wedding and was so sick of long hair that I want it even shorter now  I will say that its not a NEON purple but it is most definitely purple.,FancyFollicles,cy6ttnh,1,t5_2sa9a

6280143,0,t3_41ff21,Aphogee Two Step Protein Treatment you can buy it at Sallys. It wont completely fix it but it will make your hair feel tolerable and keep you from having to do one major chop. I do recommend using a different deep conditioner with the treatment.Also cut out heat styling or cut back as much as possible. Also keep up on dusting the ends until eventually the dead is gone.Sadly once hair becomes gummy it is completely dead. There isnt really anything you can do to bring it back.

6331745,0,t3_42cqzh,There have been various different products over the years that do this but one Ive personally used and am using at the moment is Overtone I already dye my hair red and use the extreme red to keep it vibrant. Its actually made my hair feel so much softer since Ive started using it and I like the pepperminty smell of it. They have different levels of vibrancies that will do more or less and show some nice swatches with progressively darker hair.I got the kit with both the weekly treatment and the daily conditioner. I sometimes use the conditioner as my wash and because of my curlydry hair avoid washing on other days. My only complaint about it is the price both for the product and shipping.  shipping is kind of ridiculous and having to spend  to get free shipping seems steep to me. The amount of product in a bottle is okay but if you have long hair youre going to go through it fast. The weekly treatment seems like a good amount of product for the price though. The color sample bottles are almost not worth it unless theyre on sale or youre already getting something else.,FancyFollicles,cz9clwh,6,t5_2sa9a

10347113,0,t3_5nyvxf,Disclaimer Im not a hair stylist but Ive done tons of research and was obsessed with colorful hair for a good few years. It looks to me like your roots turned out to be much lighter andor was waaaay more porous than the rest of your hair more likely opition than the rest of your hair is so they took more color. Its also possible that it looks more pink because a your scalp is still stained pink so it the hair looks super pink because of the pink background and b because the pink color molecules might be larger than the violet molecules and therefore took over before the violet could. It sounds like kind of a reach but I know that red is a very strong color and always fades to a pink that is IMPOSSIBLE to get rid of. So my logic leads me to believe that maybe the pink just kind of pushed the violet out and said this is my space beeotch! I dont know.That blonde stripe is super strange though. I have no idea why that would have happened. Except maaaayyybe its a stronger section of your hair that wasnt porous enough to soak in the color well at the time of dyeing. This option make sense to me because of the circular pattern around your head. It looks like it all grew out at about the same time. You could try shampooing with a harsh shampoo like Prell a few times to remove some of the color and make your hair nice and porous then redye and it may soak in the color better. Then follow with a nice deep conditioner. ,FancyFollicles,dcgwl2j,2,t5_2sa9a

10900899,0,t3_5vo1hc,Ive been doing it for about a year! I used the same link umaddiesh linked to.  I even did the midlength bob!  SuggestionsTips. When first trying it out only cut a small amount that way you have hair left if you mess it up!. If doing the long layers one put the ponytail in a location different than you normally wear it that way its less obvious.Here are two pictures I am the one in glasses ,FancyFollicles,de4cme0,1,t5_2sa9a

10981156,0,t3_5wsmja,I want to side note that I had my hair styled and makeup done by a MUA for a photoshoot that is not how I normally do my makeup and I felt like I looked like a different person. I had just done my hair the night before though and it was in perfect light to photograph.,FancyFollicles,decogxy,1,t5_2sa9a

11021687,0,t3_5xd59z,Im curious as to why you feel you need to bleach just to reapply a darker natural shade back on top? If you were SUPER dark or had a whole lot of crazy colors going on this might be needed  but looking at your photo you should be able to achieve a level  strawberry blonde fairly easily using a permanent color and  volume developer. Youre already hanging around the level  area naturally so you dont need that much lift and the warmer pigments exposed will actually help achieve a really nice warm undertone to your blonde. If you bleach and color on top of that youll just be needlessly blowing out the cuticle and make it that much harder for your hair to hold onto those strawberry shades. No need to put your hair through two processes. Wella Color Charm RG with  vol should do the trick. Is your hair previously colored?,FancyFollicles,deha0kv,2,t5_2sa9a

11056853,0,t3_5xw1ax,I have had colored hair before but nothing this dynamic. I run a small gaming YouTube channel and this year Im going for a Magical Girl motif. I brought in a image of a character I use for the channel art and asked my hairdresser to get as close as she could to it and...she did. Im so very happy. It has teal on top and two shades of melted blue and two shades of melted purple underneath.Before this my hair was super faded tealgreen with about two inches of brown roots. Photo is by Jazz Walker on FB Also My hair was done by Kelsi at a HairCuttery in Jacksonville Florida. If youre in that area and need more information reach out to me via PM.

11150352,0,t1_devrpq6,I know right! Ive been a lot of colors pink turquoise purple rainbow and this was one I hadnt been. Im thinking of continuing to try them all out before I go back to normal. My mom would thank me but its mainly that my hair is very tired of being bleached. ,FancyFollicles,devvpd0,1,t5_2sa9a
11169166,0,t3_5ykwrv,You can do a bleach bath and it can help with the additional lighting thats what I have done several times now and it takes me pretty light blonde. Then tone it and you can dye it from there,FancyFollicles,dey0hgv,1,t5_2sa9a
11195842,0,t1_df0yjtm,Thanks for the advice! Youre right I wont be trying this at home.  Its great to hear that about maintenance though! That was actually a concern I didnt address in the post but its real  since Ive never dyed or even had a styled cut maintenance for me just meets shampoo and conditioner a couple times a week and blow drying on the cool setting.  If I were to get the ombr maybe Id add a purple toner shampoo? ,FancyFollicles,df11a18,1,t5_2sa9a

I would love a pixie cut which is probably where Ill head next.My hair grows so fast it took just over a year to reach the length on the left after having it cut similar to my new length.Ive been almost every colour under the sun and hadnt been blue since I met my fianc  years ago so its a bit of a blast from the past plus it was one of the only hairdyes under my sink P,FancyFollicles,dge25t7,17,t5_2sa9a

11797831,0,t1_dgxb9x1,Thanks so much I box dyed it the same blonde for nearly two years before this I was getting highlights done professionally every  months. It took a long time to embrace dry shampoo but I wash it every  days now I washed it every single day for the first  years of my life... Poor hair! so that really helps it a lot I think. I chopped it all off almost  years ago so its so much fun having longer hair again! Now if I could only learn how to French braid it... ,FancyFollicles,dgxboz9,2,t5_2sa9a
