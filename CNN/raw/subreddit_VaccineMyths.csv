139638,0,t1_ceubtsu,LOL!!!!!I cant figure out if uacideath is a troll or just extremely uneducated on the topic of the flu vaccine.  I kind of get the feeling hes a troll because he keeps intentionally misquoting uantivaccine or not understanding what uantivaccine is saying.,VaccineMyths,ceuc21l,3,t5_2zqu3

11633004,0,t1_dgekox7,I dunno. Some people are just unlucky. Hard to work with anecdotes but we can do a post mortumWhich year  month of each? What brands did you get? Three or four strain shots? Did you get FluMist one year? What hemisphere are you from and whats your age bracket? Also note that the flu shot efficacy is measured by reduction in hospitalization due to the flu not prevention. By all accounts unless youre just special in a bad way your flu should have been milder than had you passed up the vaccine. Its also possible youre just bad with handling the flu through whatever quirk in which case the vaccine would be recommended moreso. ,VaccineMyths,dgem3j0,1,t5_2zqu3
