2749913,0,t1_cngkoi5,Wow your perspective on the timing and methodology of exploration is incredibly helpful. Thanks! I also have a question about the psychology of an exploration geologist Knowing how rare it is for a good prospect to eventually become a mine Ive heard its  out of  good prospects does an exploration geologist have the mindset While I think there might be a viable deposit in this area its my job as a scientist to try to prove myself wrong in order to prevent futile investment in the resource. And I can be delightfully surprised if I cant do that because there really is a wonderful asset here Or is it the exploration geologists job to use all the tools and resources at his disposal to bring forth as much data from the surveying etc. as possible so that an economic geologist can make an informed recommendation as to the projects viability? Are the roles of exploration geologist and economic geologist mutually exclusive?,mining,cngnjcw,1,t5_2rlp4
3009420,0,t3_2umoys,There are a vast amount of roles mining engineers can take...On an actual mine site there is short term planner mid term planner long term planner blast engineer dispatch engineer ore control ventilation engineer for underground general manager other supervisoryproject engineering roles and more. Mining engineers can also be hired for geotechnical work.There is also civilcontracting work that a mining engineer can do. This includes tunneling shaft sinking rock mechanics and more.As someone else mentioned in this thread you can work for a mine software company. This includes all of the different design programs out there directed towards the mine industry. For this you could either do the actual coding andor training of users.You could also work for the government! Theres plenty of work working for different organizations like the BLM or MSHA in the US. Often its a lot of paperwork though and a ton of travel.There is also academia...,mining,co9xa5h,3,t5_2rlp4

4226265,0,t1_cs1xxry,Thank you for your thoughts.gt Is your graphite hydrophobic?As I understand it graphite is hydrophobic by nature so I think yes.gt Is your coolant sufficiently like water to exploit hydrophobic properties?No I dont think I can exploit the nature hydrophobic properties of graphite from what I can tell either the emulsifying agent or mineral oil is preventing the graphite from being hydrophobic separating.gt a chemical to prevent coalescence Is this to prevent coalescence of the graphite or the bubbles? In my coolant the graphite is already being prevented from coalescing due to either the mineral oil or the emulsifying agent.I think I need to focus first on the frother agent. I know that machining coolant has additives to prevent foamingfrothing of the coolant so this could be a nonstarter. Is the frother critical or does it simply increase efficiency of the process?,mining,cs1yz8o,2,t5_2rlp4

I planned on having it be continuous miner rather than blasting. Do mines use both or is it strictly either or?The cave idea is really interesting.

You cannot get a new leasepermit until .Ask yourself why would a leaseholder give up a lucrative source of placer gold to a newcomer when he could dredge it himself or sell rights to an already established dredger?History shows that the only people who make money on a gold rush are the people who get in on it very early and the people who sell supplies to those people.

8047651,0,t3_4pdsf6,Since this thread is active can I ask about buying an oil field? Not really mining yes but related still. I was thinking is it possible to buy an oil field as an environmental project? Leave the oil in the ground so nobody can burn it and add co to atmosphere. Maybe a kickstarter project to get funding.

8055001,0,t1_d4lebf9,Yeah Ive heard of all the danger hence me being hesitant to go in them. But the legend is that my grandfather Papa Jack his dad and a business partner call him bp for short found gold on the last day a claim was valid. When My great grandfather ggf and bp were leaving the mine in a cart to explain what they had found the cable snapped and threw them out the front of the mine. Ggf dislocated his hip. The bp was basically fine but was huge nancy and demanded to ride the horse. Because of my ggf having to walk  Papa Jack was on the horse as well as it couldnt take two grown men they werent going to make it back to town in time to renew the claim. So they turned around went back to the mine and dynamited it shut. The plan was to go back to town and get the claim back after the grace period was up as I understand it if you let a claim lapse you couldnt immediately snatch it back up the public could take a shot at it first but maybe Im incorrect in this and get the claim back to finally get the gold. The vein they discovered was supposed to be a thick as PapaJacks thumb the grown up version of him saying this and he had huge hands. But he never really made it back and he sure as hell wasnt going to tell anyone else the exact location outside the family of course.I cant even say that its official that one of the five mines is the one Im talking about. But Im going to find each one and document it. I think its a cool story and Im truly fascinated by the Gold Rush and the history of it all. But how cool would it be if one of them did have gold? Or even better I find the original blown mine.,mining,d4lgi6z,3,t5_2rlp4

They should be able to help you find out what you want to know and if you want to see a mine for yourself check out Pioneer Tunnel in Ashland or the Number  mine in Lansford both are former underground coal mines that are now open for tours.

11120360,0,t1_desh78b,Youve also got bog ore which might be a good start for you. Bog ore forms in soil horizons around bogs and swamps where the iron ore is found as goetithe with a distinct reddishyellow colour.Go to a bog and look for water which is bright orange. This is likely near a spring where the water is carrying iron. The low pH and dissolved oxygen means that once it hits the surface it will precipitate as little nodules which are accumulated in peat. So if you find the orange water dig up part of the bank carefully and see if the peat is ochre in colour and if it has these nodules. If it does you have iron ore.I have no idea how youd smelt it though.,mining,deshfkk,1,t5_2rlp4

11278342,0,t1_dfa809v,Mine Processes are important mining methods sequencing also are vital. Rock type and geology stuff really falls under the geologists so dont concern yourself too much with thatAll the complex rock mechanics and finite element modelling is usually done my specific rd party consultants. EITs junior engineers in Canada are responsible for mine planning mine design sometimes surveying and ventilation blast design occasionally reviewing blast patterns and some modelling. Make sure you pay attention in fluid mechanics if you decide to go the ventilation route and being good with software is important cad and Vulcan or whatever D software is used where you are.  Try your best to get work placement in mines for mining projects as some guys go the consulting route and it may pigeon hole you. Working for the mines is awesome because you dont have to worry about clients like you do in consulting and if your first job is a labour or non technical role dont mistake the value in such a job as you witness the backdoor of mining that  of engineers dont witness thus making them shitty stupid engineers lol,mining,dfadtiw,2,t5_2rlp4
