9551001,0,t3_5bh0k6,It is completely necessary to show the world the Family is living in when the story begins.  The UK and the Royal Family at this point were very much still sovereigns over the empire and an imperial regime.  The story tellers are obviously laying the foundation for the gradual erosion of the empire over subsequent seasons for better or for worse. ,TheCrownNetflix,d9qcwbx,2,t5_3akoe
9551146,0,t1_d9o53v9,The show does a good job of making me feel conflicted about him on one hand you have the disgusting letters and twisted family views and on the other you have the sadness and love for his wife. I know he was much worse in real life and that the show ignores a few things but its still a bit hard to fully hate him watching him sit in his chair alone away from his homeland watching the coronation on TV and then crying at the end playing his bagpipes.,TheCrownNetflix,d9qdjhj,35,t5_3akoe

9559814,0,t1_d9ramp5,Yeah as an American I think its interesting if only because of how alien the whole institution is. People need to be careful not to mistake that interest for envy though.

9709023,0,t1_da7v5qv,I think theyre trying to toe the line between artistic freedomexpression but also paying due respect to the fact that these people are still alive. With all the importance placed on their role in society I think the creator is trying to show restraint. I wouldnt doubt QE II or at least her grandchildren has glimpsed at the show  although theyll never admit it  and could you imagine her reaction to racy sex scenes involving her fictional counterpart?Although I still chuckle at what her reaction was to the get on your knees line.,TheCrownNetflix,da9ugfw,4,t5_3akoe
9791274,0,t3_5dks16,He kept his allowance until his death and Wallis received it for the fourteen years between his death and hers. It was a more complicated legal situation than explored by the show because Edward held a lifelong deed to two palaces that arent owned by the state but rather are the monarchs personal property. He gave them up to his brother and later niece in exchange for the allowance legally the situation was quite messy and while some in the royal family argued he didnt really own them after the abdication no one wanted to go to court over it. The legal mechanisms involved just werent set up to handle that sort of situation. ,TheCrownNetflix,dajzk4o,3,t5_3akoe
