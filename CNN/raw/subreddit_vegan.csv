It doesnt make enough sense to be legitimate as an ethical lifestyle IMO. Saying I was vegetarian was accurate  of the time so meh.

Quite simply its the best place ive ever seen animals kept in terms of welfare and standard of living.The Lion Encounter is where the above truck drives around one of these enclosures EXTREMELY SLOWLY stopping at several points and dishing out meat through the bars. There is a clear perspex panel on the top of the truck to prevent anything falling onto the people inside. It only happens once per day at a set time.They use an airlock system to enter and leave the enclosure no need to poke animals out of the way or anything like that.If anyone is interested in learning anything else about Orana Wildlife Park just ask!

I think the important thing is thinking about how you want to be in this world and questioning those ideas and habits that have been ingrained in you from your surroundings.

I live in NZ and our rivers are some of the most polluted in the world because of our dairy industry but we market ourselves as clean and green and seeing the worlds fisheries on the brink of collapse made me change.

The only focus of discussion was how to alter care for slaves so they wouldnt suffer so much.

175193,0,t3_1w3hfd,Heres some of the most common newbie advice on here  Make sure youre getting sufficient calories. Using a calorie counter app can help in the beginning.   Learn to cook and eat a variety of foods. Youll feel crappy if your diet is lacking in things like fruit and veggies.   Get your B either from supplements or fortified foods.   Dont stress out about protein if youre getting sufficient calories and are eating well youll be fine. You can get cheaper produce by subscribing to a food box joining a coop or joint a CSA program. Things like dried lentils and beans are also dirt cheap if you get them in bulk. Cooking wise I love Veganomicon as a cook book. Im also a fan of quick fix vegan when Im in a hurry.

I do this when Im preparing them for nonvegetarians because I dont want to them off beans. The same with vegetables avoid crunchy green vegetables raw.

In another thread someone asked something like how many vegans are vegan for ethical vs. health reasons. And a lot of the replies were along the lines of if youre not vegan for ethical reasons you just have a vegetarian diet and arent vegan.Thats exactly where vegans go wrong for mainstream success vegans must accept people that are doing it for just health reasons.  As you said gluten free is EVERYWHERE when the number of people that actually suffer from gluten allergies is very minimal. If vegans want mainstream acceptance and more products available promoting it as a healthy diet separating it from the ethical nature is somewhat necessary.People dont want to feel like crap about their whole lives going paleo or gluten free doesnt make people feel that way. Trying to indoctrinate people with the diet and showingtelling them of the horrors that animals have gone through at the same time is the wrong way.,vegan,cfjibvj,2,t5_2qhpm

Also instead of seitan and tofu try whole beans. They have a lot more fiber and nutrients anyhow and are cheaper too. And cooking them without oil is super easy. Natural peanut butter can be used in moderation for quick protein but get REAL natural peanut butter that is just ground peanuts. Not natural peanut butter that has natural high fructose corn syrup or any other added sugar or oil or salt for that matter. And you still have to watch calories with it. Personally I find it very easy to overeat peanut butter. I highly recommend the book Eat to Live. The authors website is here  and heres the outline But basically eat lots of whole foods and try to avoid added sugar fat and salt. Eat plenty raw and for cooked stuff try to steam or make soups.   ,vegan,cflz873,2,t5_2qhpm

You said that we brought to life a terrible system but the animals that we torture only exist because of us.

One of the times I had started making it and realized I grabbed vanilla almond milk accidentally and I still loved it.If you have a food processor this pizza dough  is amazing easy and cheap.  The other day I made a pizza by slowly carmelizing several sliced onions in earth balance and olive oil and then stirring in two small potatoes worth of mashed potatoes and oregano some nutritional yeast salt and garlic and cooking them on the stovetop for a bit then topping the dough and baking.

583049,0,t1_cg6dtvg,gtExcept a dogs natural diet is definitely meat.  Even if its true and I think there is a huge argument to be made that dogs are much more opportunistic feeders than the wolves theyre descended from who cares? Youre not going to try to convince someone not to have their dog undergo surgery to remove a tumor because dogs dont naturally get surgery or that they shouldnt prevent pet overpopulationsuffering by getting their dog spayedneutered because its not natural. Youre not going to convince someone that they shouldnt bring their dog inside in winter because naturally dogs dont live inside. Youre not going to convince someone not to adopt any of the hundreds of breeds of dogs that weve purposefully bred into existence because they dont naturally exist.Natural doesnt matter.

682945,0,t3_21z1le,Veganism is a VERY touchy subject with a lot of people so even just suggesting once can have strong negative consequences. Its like religion that way you probably wouldnt want your friends suggesting you convert even if it was little steps and offered very politely.Im of the opinion that you actually do convert the most people by simply living as an example. So many people have preconceived notions of vegans that just disproving the stereotype is a big step. But being pushy about it is going to reinforce the stereotype instead. I answer questions politely as long as they arent intended maliciously even when they are stupid or border line offensive. Im healthy. Other than that Im just a normal person. Just seeing this starts spinning wheels in other peoples heads. If Im being completely honest it does bother me that all my friends are meat eaters. If there was anything I could do to convert them I would but its like Inception the idea has to come from within. My sister was vegetarian for years before I finally took the plunge. Of course it really depends on your relationship. There are certainly success stories of friends and family converting each other. But I think that has to come from a place of strong trust and mutual respect. My roommate actually recently went vegetarian. His brother is the one who suggested it and should get the credit but he asks me a lot of questions along and I think seeing how healthy I am helped sway him. Anyway its a fine line and everyone has to draw for themselves. I am certainly not trying to discourage the activists. I just think that being passive can actually be the best way to further the cause in some cases. So you shouldnt feel bad.If you want to do more for animals theres plenty of opportunities for volunteering or you can donate to farm sanctuary etc. EditI reread your post. Sorry youve got to deal with so many negative comments. That really is the worst and Im not so accommodating there. When someone is explicitly harassing me I definitely push back.

If he wants to have genuine discussions about the ethics or health concerns about veganism be armed in facts but avoid lecturing. If he just wants to tease or belittle you you can reiterate that an ethical diet is important to you that youre not going to try to change his diet and youd prefer if he didnt try to change yours.uM is right people definitely get bored of pestering after a few weeks or months.I spent  days in Munich I lost about  kg.

Since I found their cookbooks I have learned to cook really well and cookingbaking has become one of my favorite things to do. My omnivorous friends even love their recipes. Just dont expect vegan cheese to taste like dairy cheese but other than that you wont be disappointed. Soy yogurt is usually super yummy but theres also coconut and almond at a lot of grocery stores.

873956,0,t1_ch3j6lp,I think the point about putting people on the defensive is very important. I am not a vegan or even a vegetarian at this time but I definitely understand why people would be. I understand that these animals suffer and even if they didnt it isnt my right to decide they should die for me to eat when it isnt even necessary for my survival.Having said that and I realize how pathetic this sounds being a vegan is a big inconvenience. As you say our society accepts it but you have to go out of your way to do it. You wont be stoned by the masses for it but my boss will still invite me and my coworkers over for barbecues my family will still cook turkey for thanksgiving etc.It is absolutely true that if we were starting from scratch and I had to set up an industrial way to process beef and chicken to eat meat I would definitely not have the stomach for it no pun intended. On the other hand since that has already been done the easiest path is to eat meat. I know I sound pathetic and weakly moral to you guys. But keep in mind there are a lot of meat eaters like me  telling us all that were nazis and evil for taking the path of least resistance may be true but it wont convert anyone. I think most of us just need time to realize that its worth the effort and potential friction with families and coworkers to do the right thing. Pushing people away from your position because were evil and youre good doesnt leave any room for people who want to work to get better. And isnt it a good thing if people want to move in the right direction even if it isnt at the speed youd like?The question isnt directed at  you Llieaay I am really just agreeing with what you are saying. ,vegan,ch3mfif,2,t5_2qhpm

You and I have the capacity to make ourselves healthier reduce the impact on the earth and reduce suffering in the world by simply making food choices.  It is not moral to ignore the information once you know about it and have the capacity for change.  In addition most of us dont have an all or nothing attitude about veganism.  Reduction from large groups of people has far more impact than small groups practicing complete abstinence from animal products.  Veganism is a journey of awareness.

975972,0,t1_chf56mg,While I understand what you mean about attitude I have to say that there are still several people who will be rude to you about your diet despite your attitude. And its unfair to blame OP entirely when its clear the people asking were looking for an argument as well. Im always super polite whenever someone asks about my diet I never argue with anyone about veganism IMO veganism is a personal choice and Im not out to change anyones diet I dont lecture or even talk about animal welfare. Hell whenever someone asks why Im vegan I say personal reasons so the entire animalrights subject isnt even brought up. For the most part people are polite back some are even interested enough to ask for recipes etc. Totally cool of them I agree! Yet I have still encountered people who become very passive aggressive and just dont want to let the topic go even when I am no longer engaging them. There is still a line between genuine curiosity and the desire to troll or express superiority over someone. Asking me where I get my protein is totally cool if its clear the person is genuinely interested. However there are times when the person asking is clearly just out to troll. The tone in which they say it and the context will let you know. If the person is trolling though the best thing to do is stop the conversation because its going nowhere but I digress... Some of the comments OP mentioned happen to me regardless of my attitude. The  but your shoes arent vegan! thing is actually really common. These are people who eat meat and dont actually care about using animal products yet they suddenly care whether someone is wearing leather? Its pretty obvious that the person just wants to make the vegan look bad and hypocritical so they can claim moral superiority. And you know what? Its pretty annoying and rude. Ive had people lecture me on ethical ways of buying animal products telling me how Im making a mistake. Ive encountered so many supposed nutrition experts with no credentials to speak of lecture me on the lack of health in my diet while they eat a bacon cheeseburger and ice cream. TLDR Actually people can be dicks to vegans regardless of the vegans attitude. Trolls actually do exist. Nothing wrong with venting about it. ,vegan,chf86g5,8,t5_2qhpm

1141250,0,t3_276e0x,The way to change the world is not to convince other people to change it for you. Thats just passing the buck. It denies the responsibility you have for the way of the world. To change the world is to change yourself. Live as you think others should live and show them it can be done. Defend your beliefs and actions and ask them to reconsider theirs.When you try to convince others to do things you are forced to compromise. My goto example is gestation crates for pigs in Canada. They are finally being slowly phased out. Thats the big win. Now pigs who are forced to give birth for their masters and are kept in cages for their whole lives are allowed to have slightly bigger cages. Thats where lobbying and ethical movements gets us. Slightly bigger cages.When it comes to choosing how you live you dont need to compromise. Every action you take is your action and no one elses. As long as youre not hurting anyone with your choices youre free to make them. By making the compassionate choices you show others that it is much easier than they imagine. You gain enough respect of others that you may defend your positions to them and attempt to convince them to do the same. Slowly over generations opinions shift.Eventually we will win. I very much doubt I will live to see a world in which it is considered abhorrent to enslave and slaughter animals but I believe that it will come and that my actions are contributing in a small way to it.,vegan,chy02at,2,t5_2qhpm

The answer is that we cant currently... no matter what EEGs MRIs whatever instrument you can think of tell us its all indirect and doesnt tell us anything about the qualia of the experience what it is like to subjectively experience the brain information we are measuring. Consciousness is a really strange thing. For instance how can we know that everyone around us isnt just a fleshautomaton biomechanical human machine designed to mimic every physical property of humans but totally devoid of a mind or internal experience? This is the problem with other minds.I think the plants argument is silly too when it is about the difference between one plant and one animal or equivalent nutritional value units of the two. The ecological impact one is a good one... but meatdairy certainly do not better lend themselves to that ideal than plants do as hunting and gathering pasture raised animals would never be able to meet the demand as efficiently as plants or at all.

1280329,0,t1_cidk6ji,Not really. Bees are shipped all across the country on semi trucks to pollinate the fruits and vegetables you eat. The California almond industry alone imports something like . million beehives from out of state for its pollination. The transportation of the hives does a lot more damage than the honey collecting. The honey also HAS to be harvested because the hives produce way more honey than they could ever consume. Once the hive fills up too much a large portion of the hive will move on to form a new one and we cant just have an infinitely multiplying number of honey filled beehives in the world.  personally I dont care if a vegan eats honey or not I dont like the taste myself but dont fool yourself into thinking that by abstaining from eating it you are somehow removing yourself from the cycle of honey production. Just like how the baby cows used to make veal are a byproduct of the dairy industry honey is a byproduct of the otherwise vegan foods that you eat everyday. ,vegan,cidnk03,1,t5_2qhpm

1422427,0,t1_ciui93s,gt you want to tell me that the cohort of almost all scientific studies done on saturated fat and heart disease is propaganda? Its not even an American study which more often than others has corporate funding.No your claim that neither cholesterol nor saturated fat give you heart disease is propagandist and is not supported by the evidence. There is only one legitimate conclusion to draw from the current evidence that it is inconclusive. The relationship between diet and disease is a highly multifaceted one so boiling it down to such a simple claim is both irresponsible and very clearly propaganda.gt Trying to say heart disease is vague and artherosclerosis is vastly different is simply trying to discredit evidence however you can. Both go hand in hand you dont usually have heart disease from your diet without artherosclerosis.That last sentence is extremely poorly reasoned and you should really rethink it. But thats also not the point. The point is that calculation of a pvalue requires an assumption about the number of variables involved not to mention the normality of the data but you can guarantee this if the central limit theorem can be applied. The same data with more fitted variables yields a higher pvalue which washes out signal. Read up on the square distribution for more info. The vague term heart disease includes several more potentially confounding variables than the term artherosclerosis and these new variables need to be considered when arriving at a conclusion about whether results are statistically significant. This is the extent of my claim a broad definition of heart disease requires that any square fit involves many more variables and therefore makes otherwise significant effects appear insignificant. If I am correct about this criticism it is a rather sneaky statistical trick to hide evidence.I couldnt read the paper so I am not clear on how valid my criticism really is but it alarms me that all heart disease is lumped into one category. This is indicative of a paper that is seeking to respond to a very specific and subtle point that is lost on your typical science reporter who sensationalizes the headline. I think this paper is making only one point dietary guidelines should not make the claim that diets high in cholesterol and saturated fat are linked to heart disease. Anything else is reading far too much into the work.This is a professional opinion by the way. Like I said Id be happy to read the paper more thoroughly if you can find a way to provide me with the full text. The professional opinion I give here is limited to the following the paper is not saying what you claim its saying. If I understand your claim correctly you believe that the linked article constitutes evidence that diets high saturated fat and cholesterol are not damaging to heart health. It does not. It only constitutes evidence that health care professionals should be cautious in saying that high saturated fat and cholesterol diets are directly linked to heart disease.gt You know whats really cool about keto? It lowers your ratio of total to HDL cholesterol.This and pretty much everything following is countering a point I didnt make. My specific and definitely nonexpert response to ketogenic diets is this from what I can tell the strict definition of a ketogenic diet involves eating only through a feeding tube stuck in your nose to combat severe epilepsy. Im imagining that this isnt the case for you and that you are referring to the sort of lowcarbohydrate diet that I was saying is not safe for the same reasons that Atkins is not safe. My opinion is essentially based on the followinggt Individuals assigned to the ad libitum lowcarbohydrate diet in recent randomized controlled trials lost more weight at  months than individuals assigned to the lowfat reducedenergy diet but this difference was no longer significant at  months.In other words keto diets do not seem to buy you anything that you cannot get from counting calories  except that you may see results faster but at the possible cost of significant damage to your kidneys and liver. Fad diets like this often take a little while to debunk and if you really want to perform dietary experiments on yourself then you should do it as part of a wellcontrolled study so others can learn from you. Otherwise you wont have any idea about what aspects worked and what didnt. You might be giving extremely irresponsible advice to others in your life.If you want to be cautious in taking on health risks you should take articles like this seriously You should also presume that the position paper I linked earlier is speaking wisdom do not look for quick fixes to your obesity if that is an issue for you. Eat a healthy diet and forget about whether this or that label applies to it. If you honestly want to try keto whats wrong with waiting a few years while the nutritionists develop clear positions on the subject? The uncertainty that appears to exist right now is in itself dangerous. Theres no reason to risk your health for no obvious benefit.Edited to add the first paragraph.,vegan,ciukufp,1,t5_2qhpm

1526367,0,t3_2bpf5k,There are three main reasons to be vegan.   animal cruelty  health and  environmental sustainability.   has already been covered by other responses.   is not a black and white issue in that you can be healthy or unhealthy as a vegan or a nonvegan i.e. you still need balanced nutrition in either case.  But animal proteins do significantly increase the likelihood of developing many cancers diabetes heart disease and of course obesity.  Finally  modern factory farming has massive negative environmental impacts.  E.g. in the US the livestock industry damages the climate more than transportation it also is responsible for a huge amount of pollution and other waste that often ends up in public water sources.  In short it is very difficult to be an environmentalist without being vegan.

1695166,0,t3_2dt13a,gt my girlfriend has nothing against my non veganism.I dont believe this is true. Your girlfriend doesnt eat animals for a reason. It isnt a whim or a fancy shes must genuinely feel for those animals. I dont know if youre a pet lover dogs or cats or so on but if you can relate to the disgust pet lovers feel upon seeing pet abuse you can probably relate to how most vegans feel about meat. That being the case she must care about you a lot or want to make the relationship work a lot to say quiet and respectful about your eating habits. I just want to bring to light the effort it actually takes to eat with a nonvegan a lot and not bring it up or preach about it. Its hard work! It really is! If she can put that amount of work into your relationship Im sure you can suck it up and find a way to cope with this.Regarding the fuming vegans are in an awkward position. We have strong moral opinions and we back them up with our actions. This is good. Most people dont get it though so we end up stuck between our moral convictions and the societal norm. This is like being stuck between an angry rhino and a pit full of snakes you dont want to upset either but sometimes you dont have a choice. Many vegans will poke the rhino and eat veggie over vegan if they dont have a vegan choice and others will jump into the snake pit and be one of those rude pushy vegans. Sounds like she feels lost and out of control of her situation and the absolute worst thing you can do is push her one way or the other or break up with her over something shes already struggling with. Which would you rather she did? Made compromises on her morals or demanded vegan meals on dates? Pick your evil and encourage her to do that thing and tell her your support her all the way.Or you know you could do dates that dont involve restaurants. Picnics hiking museums movies cycling sunsets beaches tennis painting class ballroom dancing art galleries opera theatre etc etc etc and food can take a back bench. I dont mean to be abrasive but before you stop supporting your girlfriend in what she does please talk to her about it ideally in private when shes not fuming.,vegan,cjsu7yn,23,t5_2qhpm

1716025,0,t3_2e2k1m,If you are going vegan for a  day period you dont really have to worry about supplements even though they are not likely to hurt. I take a vegan multivitamin and Dcalcium as I live in the northern part of Europe and dont get too much sun even in summer.I adore all types of Asian food. They are easily made vegan and focus heavily on veggies. I cook almost all the food I eat myself and my staples are curries stir frys chili pasta with sauce and different soups and salads. Dont become a junk food vegan! Lots of snacks are vegan but are less than healthy make sure you eat a balanced diet and treat yourself at times.If you get invited to someones home offer to bring a vegan option with you and bring enough food for others to have a taste bonus points if it works with the hosts menu. If bringing food isnt an option just eat beforehand. If you are going to a restaurant try to pick one that caters to vegans or mailcall the restaurant a few days in advance and ask if they can prepare a vegan option for you.People will always be curious about your diet and there will without a doubt be questions but you choose how far you are willing to discuss it. When I get the question Ill judge if they are really interested or if they just want to pick an argument. If they are genuinely interested Ill answer truthfully about my reasons but Ill keep it short. Its best to stall such a discussion til after dinner in my experience.Most places I go to that are not veganvegetarian for the getgo are usually accommodating if they have a heads up. But there might be times where youll have to order a salad and ask them to not put meatcheesedairy dressing on it.Nuts and died fruit are excellent hiking snacks. In my country you can buy dry vegan pasta sauce that you just add water to for longer trips were you need to bring proper meals.In the EU the meat and dairy farmers are heavily subsidized meaning they get government funds to produce their products at a lower price that does not reflect production cost. The vegan meat and dairy substitutes do not get the same treatment. The producers of vegan products can usually charge silly prices as vegans dont really have that many options and the market competition is low.To eat a cheaper vegan diet focus more on beans than on soy. If you want soy products try to buy dry textured soy protein preferably in bulk. Tofu and other soy products are usually cheaper in Asian markets than in regular grocery stores.

1762093,0,t3_2enfq9,I think youre right in that this ethical dilemma is not black and white. Its important to applaud any effort toward reduced exploitation of animals while simultaneously encouraging others to strive for more.  Obviously  percent veganism is still ideal.That being said maybe Im living under a rock but Ive never met any vegans IRL who werent supportive of any effort no matter how feebleto diminish animal product consumption. In fact Id say its part of the reason I became vegan in the first place. I had several vegan friends who simply educated me instead of criticizing me. Their world was really appealing and I was drawn in naturally. I would never directly criticize or berate someone who is not fully vegan or even vegan at allbut I think its important to still hold a highly critical view of animal exploitation and share that view with people.  My father has been an omnivore his entire life and at the risk of sounding defeatistwill likely remain that way. Same goes for my sister.  Does it frustrate me? Yeah. Do I encourage them to eat less and ideally zero meat and dairy? Yes. And that frankly is really all you can do.  Would I die before eating an animal? I dont know.

Try making cauliflower mashed potatoes.

That said from looking at what youre eating I would look at adding more vegetables especially leafy greens. In addition to being high in protein per calorie even more than most animal foods are they are full of tons of other nutrients that you need particularly iron which a vegan is no longer getting from meat and what not.Something to keep in mind with vegetables is that they are very nutritionally balanced but quickly become unbalanced choices if you cook them with lots of oil.

2069961,0,t1_cl2wpfw,I guess where we disagree is that I dont think our intentions purify our actions.  I think sometimes we may do things  with no bad intention  that still might be worth addressing. A good example would be the theme parties in fraternities and sororities that often deal with themes that can easily be racialized.  People in those organizations may just have the intention to have fun  but perpetuation of hurtful stereotypes can come from it another good example is someone wearing blackface for a Halloween costume without considering how I may come across. Sometimes things that are fun for one group have a hurtful impact on another and I dont think the latter group should refrain from addressing it just because the first group had good intentions. To use an example from another realm  yesterday Mens Health ran an article about how to help women understand sports.  Their intentions were probably quite innocent.  But the article was offensive.  Does that mean people shouldnt have spoken out about the mistaken assumptions in the article? Obviously there are a ton of differences between these two examples.  But the point is that having good intentions doesnt mean we cant discuss these issues. ,vegan,cl2xrho,3,t5_2qhpm

2074216,0,t1_cl3h83i,ampampamp Utilitarianism sfw gtUtilitarianism is a theory in normative ethics holding that the proper course of action is the one that maximizes utility usually defined as maximizing total benefit and reducing suffering or the negatives. Classical utilitarianisms two most influential contributors are Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill It is now generally taken to be a form of consequentialism although when Anscombe first introduced that term it was to distinguish between oldfashioned utilitarianism and consequentialism.  In utilitarianism the moral worth of an action is determined only by its resulting consequences however there is debate over how much consideration should be given to actual consequences foreseen consequences and intended consequences. In A Fragment on Government Bentham says it is the greatest happiness of the greatest number that is the measure of right and wrong  and describes this as a fundamental axiom In An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation he talks of the principle of utility but later prefers the greatest happiness principle.  gtgtImage iInteresting Utilitarianism book | Richard Brandt | Form follows function | Rule utilitarianism Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwclhh oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeleteclhh.

But those subscriptions and more importantly  your defense of certain subreddits are a valid basis   along with your comments   for forming an opinion about you. This is my opinion of you.  You seem more concerned about your own experience a a white girl and the vague specter of people trying to make you feel guilty something I  as a white woman  have never experienced than actual oppression. If you are serious about not being racist which I still doubt that you even consider making common cause with reprehensible people because you share a common interest in opposing hate crimes legislation makes me question your perspective. There are things more important than people making you potentially feel bad. ,vegan,cl6nlk1,0,t5_2qhpm

What do you think his motives are? EDIT Just saw your post at the top.I will say this though. I think threads like this one aggravate the situation. The whole reason these comments he has made are a problem is that he is saying them with regards to and acting in favour of animal rights which can generate bad publicity.

2116641,0,t1_cl8bkiu,Since you are the top comment asking about this I am replying to you but I found this article by the Huffington Post after seeing these comments and trying to look for a good answer. gt Furthermore because Universal Orlando wanted as many guests as possible to be able to sample this brew and that included the lactose intolerant there could be no butter or dairy products of any kind in Butterbeer.And thengt First the bottom layer  a slightly thickened mixture which tastes like a combination of butterscotch cream soda and shortbread cookies  is poured into the bottom of the glass. Then the Butterbeers head  which is this lighter fluffier less sweet version of marshmallow fluff  is carefully placed on top of the brown brew that has previously been poured into this glass.What do you think?

2126129,0,t1_cl8bav0,Id have a hard time counting him properly as a philosopher sure he got the undergrad degree but he doesnt do any work in the field.  Hes upfront about not actually following current developments in moral philosophy so I give him as much merit as any shlub off the street whos had a good think on it.  Its been gone over and over in askphil cause people read his books then get all excited then have to learn hes kind of a philosophical moron.  Its just a shame that such a hack writer filled whatever niche he filled because ethics is really really neat.The main problem with Harris views is that he just assumes that wellbeing is the basis of morality without arguing for it.  He doesnt seem to understand that utilitarianism because utilitarianism since wellbeing isnt an argument.  Nobody that I know whos actually studiedresearched ethics takes him seriously.  EDIT  Also morality cant be determined scientifically.  This seems selfapparent in that there are no instruments that detect how much one ought to do something.

I am sick and tired of this line of questioning that people always bring to vegans as if perfection is mandated if one is anything other than apathic. I have been given shit the past two days for caring about racism even though I am white. For caring about the rights of others be they animal or human. So I am sick and tired of the whole youre not as ethical as you think you are. Followed by nothing else but Im not required to do anything I dont care about being ethical but you need to check your ethics because youre not perfect and thus not good enough and it all starts with theAre you being as environmentally conscious as you could be? Are you getting your items from slave labor? Are you donating all of your extra money?I wouldnt mind if people actually gave some constructive criticism but no. Its all desiged to make me feel like shit or anger me. And no I dont need to be patted on the back for the good things I do in life. Quite the opposite there is always so much I cant do at the moment and am working towards doing in the future but that is my goddamned problem and not other peoples. The fact that I dont have the money to donate to the UNICEF or Oxfam at the moment does NOT mean that the discussion of veganism is INVALIDATED by my inability to save the entire world.gtNo I was just curious. Its a discussion board where people ask questions and stuff so I was just making polite conversation.No you werent. Its not polite conversation to imply that someone is a hypocrite for not getting into debt or spend all their time raising funds to save people in conflict areas because imagine if it was your family!It isnt polite conversation or smalltalk.gtI dont believe its an imperative for me to do stuff like that. I didnt mean to suggest that pursuing those ideals is necessary for everyone. My values dont demand that I constantly seek a higher level of virtue or whatever. I also dont believe that eating meat is wrong.Then why the HELL do you care what vegans do in the goddamned first place? Thats an honest to fucking seitan question.If you really dont think eating meat is wrong and you dont really care about helping people in war torn countries slave labor or doing this or that WHY are you in rvegan asking if were doing these things as food for thought?What on earth makes you think that it adds something relevant to discussions about veganism?Why on earth would you think vegans automatically do not care about other people also animals the environment important to protect for animals and humans and similar things? Or that we need to be reminded of them from someone who doesnt really care about it themselves?Some on here have chosen to dedicate most of their focus to veganism instead of spreading themselves thin. That doesnt mean they dont recycle plant their own food or pruchase generally ethical clothing.Others have a hand in several different movements charities and causes. But that is not relevant to the discussion of veganism.,vegan,clasuan,3,t5_2qhpm

2298654,0,t1_clvsa0w,But hopefully you will choose a partner who is also vegan. I doubt that its just health concerns. She tried to lay down the law and shes completely dismissing his perspective. She views veganism as a moral imperative he views eating meat as part of his identity. Neither one of them are wrong in this but I do think that theyre fundamentally incompatible. Admittedly I find veganism to be a bit weird and utterly unnecessary but I also absolutely understand how some people can feel that way and I respect their right to eat as they choose. While I may not agree with making your kid be vegan I also respect that its the parents choice to make. In this case the other parent strongly disagrees. Its absolutely a conversation that they should have had four years ago. Its similar to a difference in religions it really is. People attacking OP for her being vegan arent contributing anything. I think that the biggest problem is her approach but also that she seems completely closed I almost wrote unopen and then went duh to compromise. I also think it would be different if she were a vegetarian or pescatarian etc. although she does keep using veganvegetarian intermittently. Vegetarian would be an easier one to compromise with IMO because theres a lot more wiggle room and theres less of a moral condescension. Im also having a huge problem with the fact that OP views eating meat as being evil but then... Dates a meateater for four years and plans to marry and procreate with him?

2377873,0,t3_2mhsl9,I have been vegan for almost  years now and I still have all of the same friends I had before I was vegan. Its a huge lifestyle change but I think it helps to really communicate with the people in your life about your habits. I recently had to have the talk with my new coworkers. Some of them are older and dont really understand what vegan means. I told them that I dont eat dairy eggs or meat including fish so they should expect me to say no thank you when offered most baked goods or candy. I also let them know that I am not offended if they eat these things in front of me I am asking them to accept my lifestyle so I accept theirs in return which they said made them feel much more comfortable. People tend to apologize a lot if there is an event holiday party potluck etc where there is nothing for me to eat but I always let them know that I never expect people to make special arrangements for me. I bring my own food to holidays and barbecues. Please dont feel like you have to change your friends or distance yourself from your family because of your new found lifestyle. Choosing to be vegan is a beautiful thing to do for the planet animals and yourself. Dont give up things will fall into place. ,vegan,cm5m3sb,1,t5_2qhpm
2380394,0,t3_2mm9kg,My acid reflux started about  years ago I was eating tons of veggies and fruits lean meats a lot of yogurt basically mostly healthy foods and definitely not a lot of fried things no fizzy drinks sweets only rarely. I was drinking a latte every morning and wine sometimes about  per month. I went to a doctor and he couldnt find any reason other than stress I did had a lot of stress at work and diet. He was surprised when I answered no to most of his do you eat... questions because most of people get acid reflux from eating badly according to him. At the end of the day I was left with instructions  no wine or any alcohol no coffee no citrus fruits no tomatoes and only mild tea that was basically all that my doctor could find being wrong in my diet. Also of course he told me to get less stressed. And I had to take pills for at least  to  months as well to help my throat and asparagus heal.I ditched coffee wine tomatoes and oranges I loved so much. I started to eat even more veggies and less processed foods and in a month I was somewhat okay. I felt like I can go without pills for  weeks and then I had to drink them again for  days. A year later I changed my job to less stressful and got even better now I could live without pills for  months and then had to take them for a week or so. And then I found out I am sensitive to lactose cut out most of dairy from my diet except cheese that took me ages I kept buying lactose free cheese and things went uphill quickly. I ran out of pills a year ago and never bought them again. And then four months I went vegan and now I eat citrus fruits and tomatoes daily tomatoes are my favorite and they are on top of avoid when you have acid reflux foods I sometimes drink vegan wine and  times per week I drink soy lattes as well and I have had zero issues with my acid reflux or stomach in general. Although I know that wine and coffee and chocolate in big amounts still make my stomach a bit sensitive so I try to consume this in small doses. My doctor is sure it was lactose intolerance combined with stress that started all the issues. He said that Ive been developing it slowly because as a kid or teenager I seemed to have zero issues with lactose and dairy and my stress made it worsen quickly. Basically the moral of this story is go to a doctor. It could be your diet even though it worked before could be stress or lack of some vitamins or a new food allergysensitivity. Being vegan isnt causing acid reflux unless youve increased consumption of something that your body is sensitive to nor its fixing it. As for remedies while you wait for your doctor appointment try aloe juice and apple cider vinegar. Both helped me somewhat also try to eat very smooth and liquidy foods something that wouldnt be too harsh on your asparagus or throat because they are already scaredsensitive from acid.,vegan,cm5xb26,2,t5_2qhpm

Your possibilities are endless as far as combining rice with a lentil or bean to form a complete protein source. They dont need to be eaten at the same meal or on the same day even.

2466390,0,t1_cmgiukj,So where can I get tiger meat? Im limited to only chicken  cow  pig meat. I need my variety! The only vitamin you cant get from plants is b. This is only because we clean our veggies and dont get b from the dirt. If we grew our own veggies we could get b from them. Otherwise a vegan diet is nutritionally complete. Why would you think its harmful if it can provide the same nutrients as meat? Yes. High quality meat can be good for you. The Inuits ate a  meat diet and did just fine. But that doesnt mean its immoral to get. Child slaves are very efficient and can produce the most money because you can pay them cents an hour. Doesnt mean its ok to do.Even if you dont see animals as slaves you cant deny the environmental impact.  You deny yourself hitting people when they piss you off even though it may be very very satisfying because if you do thats not right. You cant use violence to solve your anger. It affects other people much like crating an animal for  months then butchering it affects the animal. As well as the environment.I could burn coal  because oh well I like the smell and its a good source of energy why would I deny myself that? Well because its bad for the environment.You cant just do everything you want just because you like it.,vegan,cmgjo1m,13,t5_2qhpm

Yet their slaughter still appears barabric and utterly appalling.I reckon a lot of western omnis wouldnt be comfortable with these images but still think its fine to buy ethically sourced meat.

That fear is likely based on all of the preconceived negative connections he has with veganism including giving up tastes he enjoys. I was exactly the same way. When I first heard a lot of the info challenging my use of animals my strategy was to run away and ignore it as I didnt want to be one of those weirdos or even worse give up BBQ amp spicy food!

And you avoided the environmental issue... namely that its more costly to get food from an animal than from plants but then hey with a backyard hen that cant be a whole lot of resources so... ok. So you dont like the messaging.And I dont like that message that This is fine... lets raise chickens so we can eat eggs. Why not? No one is getting hurt! In that instance maybe sure but its not like there are enough resources for everyone to have pet chickens. Plus are these chickens really in great conditions? Last I checked they live outside in a hutch with straw. I wouldnt approve of a dog being kept like that either. I think its pretty disrespectful to keep someone in those conditions when its an environment where it gets really cold in the winter amp really hot in the summer. But lets say its a perfect environment... the temperature is perfect all the time. Even then that message... This is fine because the chicken is fine. The very idea of supporting that practice is up in air... does it come across like Im fine with chickens being bred for this? Im ok with dogs being used as seeingeye dogs amp theyre basically slaves... I dont want them bred because there are too many dogs already but what if there werent? Would I want dogs bred for that? Maybe I would... but chicken eggs arent necessary like seeingeye dogs are. Theyre doing that for culinary pleasure amp presumably some degree of nutrition. It could send the message that Im in a cult... well how about the cult of animal farming? Im fine to draw the line amp say I dont want animals raised for food. But then youre not seeing the grey area! No I am. I see it clearly. I totally understand. So how about me saying I dont want cholesterol...

2653227,0,t1_cn3dhr5,Its not obvious to me that hes doing anything that lowers his carbon footprint nor is it obvious to me that lowering his carbon footprint is actually a good thing in and of itself.Environmental degradation is not caused by greedy corportations. Its caused by a global economy. Most ecological damage occurs as a result of industrial processes that are necessary for the functioning of a global economy. That includes flying many airplanes every day constantly sending ships around the world destroying entire ecosystems to make way for cities factories farms and many other things necessary to sustain a huge human population. None of that has anything to do with greed or individual choice. Whether you live in the wilderness or in society has no effect on the industrial processes you are describing as greedy. Humanity needs certain things. Its not greedy for people to expect food potable water clothing and shelter. It seriously pisses me off when people scapegoat corporations for environmental damage that really is unavoidable.So what is it that makes you think this guy is doing anything good at all? You said yourself that he didnt do it for ethical reasons but maybe his reasons dont matter. What exactly do you think the effect of his move is? Isnt it just that he went to a place he didnt have to go and started altering the ecology of that area to suit his needs? Isnt he doing what everyone else is doing? The only question is is his way more efficient than ours?The only way I can find to answer that previous question is to point out that there is no way his lifestyle can benefit from economies of scale whereas anyone who lives in an urban environment is the beneficiary of many hidden economies of scale that probably make their environmental footprint less than this asshole who is horning in on an area he doesnt belong and fucking killing a bunch of wild animals that did nothing to him to earn their fate. Hes also probably eating food that would otherwise be eaten by species native to the area and thereby making life more difficult for them. Humans have been driving species to extinction for millennia even without a global economy and they did it precisely how this asshole is doing it now.Respect him? Fuck him. The fact that anyone respects him at all is a fantastic microcosm of the problem with modern environmentalism. Every environmentalist I meet these days is just a closeted leftwinger that is so deeply wed to the appeal to nature fallacy that they cant even see their own hypocrisy in condemning greedy corporations for allowing them to live a life that is per capita extremely environmentally efficient. The solution to the environmental problems is to reduce population by making poor people rich and to make urban living less impactful. We shouldnt and wont give up on the idea that has allowed seven billion people to live on a planet that by all natural processes wouldnt be able to support even a percent of that number.Im sorry for being pissed off but not sorry enough to decide not to click save.,vegan,cn4wnvf,1,t5_2qhpm

They also apparently care for the animals until they die naturally.That sounds like the least sustainable farm ever.

How can they keep the population stable if pregnancies happen naturally and they never put down a cow?

Any moment in time when it is not usedabused is a mere contingency and one that is unlikely to persist. Think of for example an oppressive legal precedent set in a court. This can be anything. Such as e.g. an undermining of due process at the level of interpreting a states constitution or something. No specific laws are written in its name at the exact moment its set. But the fact that it exists is immediately worrysome to anyone. The same concept can be applied broadly to other power relations as well. That is the general principle that though the power hasnt been used yet the solidification of the power structure itself  the potential for its use  is clearly threatening. So I would say that assigning ourselves the role of benevolent rulers over animals is unstable territory at best as far as the rights and welfare of animals are concerned.,vegan,cnixju2,1,t5_2qhpm

If you have a little money to play with go to any whole foods and just walk around picking up items and reading the ingredients labels.  Lots of stuff is vegan there albeit some of it quite expensive.  Just chuck a bunch of random new vegan things into your cart and see if you like them.,vegan,cnuf5tf,2,t5_2qhpm

2949472,0,t1_co3czox,again I am not calculating what people need I am calculating what people actually consume. Lets go through this again please read carefully.Say a person consumes  calories in beef every day. They do not need to consume that much beef they just do. Consuming this much beef requires the production of  calories of soy to feed the cow. Then one day that person decides to stop eating beef and replace all the beef they normally eat with soy. But they continue to eat the same amount which is much more then they need to eat but is what they want to eat so they do. Instead of  calories of beef every day they eat  calories of soy every day. This  calories of soy requires the production of.... calories of soy or th of what was required for them to eat  calories of beef.So back to the math that I did originally which wad not based on what people need but based on what people are actually currently consuming.  of current actual soy production goes to the raising of beef. Obviously people dont need to eat as much as they do but they do eat as much as they do. So at current actual levels of consumption we produce x amount of soy. If people converted all of current actual beef consumption to soy consumption then that that  of world soy production that goes to producing beef would be th of what it currently is and total world soy production would be about  of what it actually is. Again no where in here am I calculating what people need to eat. I am referencing the numbers of what people actually eat so I dont understand where you are coming from with your questions. Comparing sofritas to burritos is ridiculous because neither sofritas nor burritos account for all of soy or beef consumption respectively. Thus what I am doing using  of current actual beef consumption and  of current actual soy production is much more meaningful than arbitrarily comparing two specific food items at one specific restaurant chain.I hope that clears things up.,vegan,co3dagu,4,t5_2qhpm

A wholefoods plant based diet is more beneficial than a lowcarbohydrate meaty fatty diet.Fiber is the key. Eat all the fruit you want within reason but dont drink fruit juice. Eat all the whole grains you want but dont eat refined grains or sugars.Dont eat meat dont eat refined fatty products like oils butter margarine dairy or cheese. Maintain a very high fiber intake and stick with whole plant foods. If the food does not have a lot of fiber dont eat it.It isnt carbohydrate that is evil its a lack of fiber.

3171088,0,t1_coqmjwy,Thank you. According to that youre correct in saying that they just feed the food theyre testing to the rats and then weigh them no dissection is required. But it doesnt say anything at all about what happens to the rats after the test is completed. It does say that they have to use rats of the same age sex and strain. Is it reasonable to assume that these rats were bred specifically for this test? Are they used for other tests afterwards or would they be considered contaminated? It seems that the options for what to do with the rats at the end of the test would be a euthanasia b handing them over to an animal shelter c the scientists take them home as pets d use them in other experiments e??? Which option do you think is most likely?If we assume that the rats were bred specifically for this test andor that they were killed afterwards then I can see why a company with a policy against harming animals would not want it to be performed on their behalf. I think that one could argue that the benefits of the test getting people to reduceeliminate meat from their diets via the availability of palatable vegan sausages on the market not to mention Field Roasts other vegan products like Chao cheese could potentially save more animal lives than the number of animal lives that would be lost by performing the test.The whole situation is unfortunate and unnecessary.

3184290,0,t1_cos1hu1,My two thoughts.Firstly I dont mean to argue that we should all eat rice and beans and live a minimalist life. I am however saying that meat is environmentally more damaging than staple food is not a complete argument for veganism. I am pointing this out because it is one of the most often seen argument for vegetarianism or veganism. Fact is very few of us can truly claim that we minimized our impact. Im almost certain that no one on reddit is some sort of paragon of virtue. Cutting out other things before meat would work just as well if environment is the only concern.Secondly to say that veganism or vegetarianism is that it doesnt really require any real sacrifice. is a personal statement not universal statement. I think youre aware of this. I believe that giving up meat could have been a minimal sacrifice to you but a lot of people love eating meat. I know I do. For me giving up meat would be a sacrifice in life quality equivalent of vegans eating minimalist meals. It would not be a trivial sacrifice. So to me veganism would not be a best way to reduce my footprint on the environment. I should probably quit reddit before I quit meat...,vegan,cos1v55,1,t5_2qhpm
3187462,0,t1_corvb7y,Apologies for the delay.gt... I wouldnt overstate our significance ...... nor should you understate it. Oliver Sacks the neurologist and best selling author wrote Awakenings and The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat recently found out that he has little time left to live. A few days ago we wrote an oped piece in the New York Times about his thoughts and feelings mostly gratitude. He also elegantly expressed our conditiongtAbove all I have been a sentient being a thinking animal on this beautiful planet and that in itself has been an enormous privilege and adventure.   Oliver Sacks My Own Life. NYT Feb.  The point is that we humans are sentient and relatively intelligent thinking beings something that as far as we can tell is a rarity in Cosmos. Its not overstating our significance to soberly and objectively estimate that right now we might possibly be the rarest most extraordinary most precious manifestation of the divine if one is religious laws of nature.Now the disparity between the potential offered by this privilege and the mundane banality of evil that manymost of humans are engaged in towards the other sentient beings of the planet thats another matter ... and the one you probably meant to address.gt Empathy is absolutely NOT by any means whatsoever uniquely human. Not even close. As but one of many examples Cetaceans alone have been shown to be significantly altruistic and ethical  heck empathic to an extent that we dont even fully understand and that may even be far above and beyond anything we ourselves are capable of.Yes Cetaceans also highly but differently than us intelligent do show empathy and are quite possibly ethical. They often show concern and may try to help members of other species mostly mother mammals humans dogs etc.. That incidentally is probably why in some ancient Hellene CityStates killing a dolphin was considered murder punishable by death in some cases. How the Japanese can categorise such highly sentient beings as ... food ... boggles the mind. Its like using rare illuminated manuscripts as heatingfuel or Breguet watches as doorstoppers. As beautiful and subtle as Japanese culture can be they can also be astoundingly stupid about some things. And this is such a case. The Japanese simply dont get it when it comes to cetaceans. But in any case to get back to the point I must recognise that cetaceans are also extraordinary beings. But still until I meed a dolphin equivalent of Plato Aristotle or Kant I must necessarily continue thinking of humans as unique.gt Whats disquieting isnt that anyone would have as great of a problem as I do with the pain and harm we as a species generally cause to ourselves and others. Whats disquieting is that we actually do cause this great amount of harm to ourselves and others.Youre right that the incomprehensibly horrible acts that many humans commit are more disquieting than expressing disgust at the whole of humanity because of these acts but thats irrelevant to my point.gt I dont consider humanity my own species. I do not relate to many of us to that extent and do not identify with the species like that. I am in human garb on planet Earth this time around. This is correct. It is a mistake to relate or identify too much with this incarnation however.Its not necessarily a mistake to recognise that this incarnation as you put it has some rare specific abilities.  To even try mentally transcending ones physical being necessarily defines you as a sapiens sapiens human.  I couldnt possibly have such an exchange with any but a human incarnation so to speak. The problem might even be that youre perhaps too human too intelligent sensitive and ethical to relate to the other ... and heres the thing ...  less human  less humane in other words humans. It seems that most human unethical behaviour results from what are basically primate instincts magnified by high problemsolving abilities and relatively advanced technologytechniques.gtAnd for it to become successfully spacefairing  i.e. for it to NOT end up becoming fodder for any one of the many other species out there that are vastly superior and more evolved than us  we would FIRST have to figure out how to deeply imbue the concepts of ahimsa within ourselves. Thats something that needs to be addressed right here on the ground and something which we are apparently VEEEERY far from being able to accomplish before we go anywhere else.Look Im not aware of any serious evidence of these many other species out there that are vastly superior and more evolved than us. The Fermi paradox has not yet been resolved as far as I can tell. And frankly I dont believe any of that Military whistleblower Captain Randy Cramer stuff. Too many loons andor charlatans making shit up out there. The actual real Cosmos quantum mechanics etc. is weird enough without madeup nonsense. Anyway I answered in detail because of my profound respect for ethical Veganism and the people who practise it but I do get hopelessly lost discussing the more fringe issues that you seem familiar with. So this is a good place for me to stop. Its been a pleasure in any case.Namaste,vegan,cosdppu,1,t5_2qhpm

3198239,0,t3_2wpw46,To become a vegan you are forced to question the status quo. Meatdairyegg consumption is so ingrained in our society that to question it is a big leap. To be open to that leap you probably have questioned other profound things. What I hate is people like you OP who castigate others who have good reason not to trust the system while calling yourself mostly vegan in a vegan community what the hell is that? you either are or you arent. Instead of understanding where theyre coming from theyre labeled as extremists or worse. There are irrational members of any group but there are also people outside the fringe of massive belief systems who may be right too. Just look at veganism itself. It was considered extremist when I became a vegan  years ago. It was also extremist not too long ago to believe that homosexuality wasnt a choice or to accept mixed race marriage. I actually fell into veganism questioning something else that has proven to be a huge lie yet I would still be labeled an extremist in spite of my extensive experiences. There are a lot of biases in science that are caused by money status quo and politics. There is some bad science that if nothing else fills the void of unanswered questions.  ,vegan,cothwox,-1,t5_2qhpm

Although personally after learning about the omni side I feel that their argument falls apart. I see no argument for consuming dairy we are not baby cows. I see no argument for consuming eggs because biologically speaking there is no need to. The only thing left is meat. Physiologically we are not capable of hunting it is only out of necessity that we have used tools to be a fake carnivore and we are ABLE to digest meat but I simply have not seen any evidence that including meat in our diet is more beneficial than not consuming it. But check out this debate because they are the experts and I also like hearing the other side because I think its important to stay open minded!,vegan,covikhh,-1,t5_2qhpm

Protein salad has everything from humus to even chopped avocados. Oatsmeal with .L Soya milk raw Veggies  Add up vegan susage or baked potatoes just to fill in the crave.  Gatorade if I exhausted myself in a workout.Although I feel filled this doesnt workout really well when Im in working days  hours sitting on a desk  hours moving from department to the next gets pretty tough. So I am constantly forced to change the cycle by eating exactly at the evenings and continue till the next day. Obviously this is becoming rather hard to adjust to the cycle which takes no less than a  days that is why I need to know of your diet I need variety in my food and Im rather conservative when it comes to my vegan diet but seeing your results I would like to give it a shot.

Its not about choice when people talk about prochoice it is always vs prolife its not like it really encompasses the right to choose to HAVE kids its about the right to have abortionsAbortions are good and great and more women should probably be having them. Theyre not shameful last resorts for fallen women. Some women will feel shame and guilt  thats okay but theres no need. Its normally painful and it may be extremely painful there could even be complications  sad but the way it is you can say the same about many medical procedures and I am  pro those as well. Prochoice usually seems to come with this weird little if shes the kind of terrible woman whod have an abortion she shouldnt be allowed children thing which is really not very prochoice at all and certainly not prowomen. And it always comes with caveats like as long as she used contraception as long as she doesnt do it all the time as long as she has a good reason as long as its before a certain number of weeks Ill pull out my ass  I dont have anything deep in common with the people who think this way so I deliberately use a different word to describe my beliefs.

3304997,0,t1_cp49lav,Since were in a thread about vegan feminism Id highlight the part about feeling like a piece of meat. Carol Adams and others have pointed out the problems with using phrases like that. Its a bit like Simone de Beauvoir saying that women are more than animals it tries to escape oppression by elevating oneself above animals  i.e. totally buying in to the patriarchal myth of humanism. Meat is a really depersonalising term its a mass noun that removes all difference from individuals.If youre interested in what Im going on about Id recommend Sexist Words Speciesist Roots by Joan Dunayer or maybe The Sexual Politics of Meat or Neither man nor beast by Carol Adams.,vegan,cp4zv9j,1,t5_2qhpm

Meat eaters are then norm. Theyre like  of Americans for example. I dont have a bad attitude towards those who eat meat as much as I disagree with animal farming I need to deal with our reality in  without walking around angry at people. Do I treat vegans vegetarians amp omnivores differently... nothing is particularly coming to mind.. I found out about farm animals. I have lived up until the age of  without thinking much about it I assumed farm animals were like mindless fetuses being aborted. When I watched Meet Your Meat a video showing behind the scenes footage at factory farms amp discussing normal industry practices I saw that my understanding about these animals had been totally off amp that what was happening behind the scenes was widespread evil. The scientific consensus is that these animals have intelligence like that of young children it varies by species so dogs are something like  year old kids pigs are more like  year olds etc. amp its a fact that these creatures are sentient so I couldnt amp cant ignore that by supporting their death amp exploitation so needlessly.

Pet food for cats and dogs usually comes from a secondary industry where the primary industry is food for humans and cuts that do not make the grade or animals who would normally be tossed are used. While far from ideal and personally I will not be adopting any more felines after my darling cat son dies he predates my veganism as well it is viewed by some vegans as less of an issue than supporting the breeding of mice and livefeeding directly.In that sense I think I do agree with them a little but only disagree when it comes to prevegan owned snakes. Adoption for a snake? It is up to the individual but never buy one. The thing is that these issues all tie into each other. While a human does not need meat a cat does. These cats are domesticated and our responsibility. Since they need meat we need to provide them with it. In that sense the most sustainable thing to do is feed them the byproducts of the already existing industry rather than letting them hunt themselves since domesticated felines only eat a fraction of what they kill.,vegan,cpv3jaf,1,t5_2qhpm

3606801,0,t3_31mbob,I have read through a bunch of the comments and each has varying degrees of merit.  Some people mentioned rewilding which would be a great idea to bring the ecosystem back into balance.  But that cant be done in Australia.  About  years ago they killed off the apex predator the Tasmanian tiger.  With that has come some changes.  One I just learned about last year while visiting a zoo near Sydney.  The Tasmanian devil now has a shorter life span.  They were over populating the island then started getting a cancer on their face.  And started dying at a younger age.  Well now they reproduce at a younger age.  Nature found a way to bring balance.  Usually as humans we displace kill things that are a threat to our lives this has happened to the apex predators all over the globe but we dont want to change anything else so we try to fill the void left by them. It helps to try to keep the balance we messed up.  If we stopped we dont know what would happen.  Life finds a way.  Many times we try to force the way rather than let nature take its course. Btw this from a former hunter.  Hope that helps.  ,vegan,cq3eggj,2,t5_2qhpm

Does that mean you never go out to eat at a restaurant or fast food? If you do do you not eat the meat from these places since you do cannot know where it came from?

3646134,0,t3_324tsc,. Vegans can eat anything that does not come from an animal. Flesh animal milk eggs and honey are all out of the picture. Gelatin and a few other less thoughtof animal products are also out of our stomachs. There are still so many wonderful food options that happen to be vegan it would take too long to list them all.. Eating meat doesnt always mean youre getting the proper nutrients and dietary requirements. Most vegans get plenty of protein but many meat eaters lack fiber for example. Many whole foods beans nuts legumes fruits and vegetables will assist in nutrition almost entirely anything else can be handled by vegan multivitamins and supplements.. It doesnt change your body all that much as long as you arent eating garbage like CocaCola and fries exclusively. You may notice it is much easier to defecate because of increased fiber intake. You may notice weight loss because many junk foods are nonvegan and by default ending their consumption helps your weight. Otherwise there shouldnt be that great a difference.. That depends entirely on your own body. I never went vegan for results from my body so I cannot answer you accurately.. There are nothing but positives except for comments from other people which are increasingly negative. People look down on you for making an ethical logical environmental and sustainable change. Pettiness is next to vapidness.. I dont cook full meals very often cant help you here very much either. I do like to make some drunk vegan nachos by throwing beans rice and other things on tortilla chips with Daiya cheese. Its not the most delicious thing but its a nice drunk snack.Good luck comrade.

Youtube links .coms nonpeer reviewed blogs do not work as reliable sources. .orgs sometimes do but the one .org that you provided did not have any direct link to the topic of pigs vs human children intelligence so it provides no information on the topic. Do you have any reliable sources articles  journals that I could view on this topic? Something peer reviewed by chance? Just as general discussion on this argument just so your reliable sources arent put to total waste it was claimed in one of the videos that at  months pigs were smarter than human children. The issue with this claim is the fact that pigs will eventually stop progressing and children will surpass them. Again this is why we as humans are on a higher playing field when it comes to our existence over all  due to our cognition and reasoning abilities that animals to not have. It may be true again I cant conclude until I see some reliable sources on the matter that pigs have some cognition at  months but the cognition process of pigs are different from humans. Just because the pig progresses a bit faster at earlier months does not mean it is smarter overall it just means that for a small bit of time they have an advantage over humans due to the difference in brain development. ,vegan,cqbotse,-1,t5_2qhpm

We should advocate for animals no matter what system we have and send a clear message that all exploitation is wrong whether human or nonhuman.

It may present a challenge because that control focus and idea of safe vs unsafe is mirrored a slight bit in the realities of a vegan life. Obviously it is a psychological change that need to occur more than anything else. One solution until then would be to just find brands and products through other vegans and resources rather than obsessing about the minute details I know probably easier said than done and at the same time diversify your food. I know that may sounds scary and unnecessary but spicing things up and starting to ENJOY food is so important for people with a history of eating disorders. It is so good that youve noticed this yourself this time around and you are seeking help for it yourself. It is a really positive sign. I hope you can get the psychological part onto the right keel again so to speak and the weight will follow in a positive way. Best of luck and be kind to yourself in the meantime.

But basically over the years Ive realized in many situations its not necessary for me to actually say Im vegan. I already know a lot of local restaurant menus and which are vegan so Im sure to recommend one when planning social meals without specifically saying Im vegan. If someone suggests a restaurant I dont know Ill do the research to find out if its vegan on my own. If someone remarks on the healthiness or meatlessness of my meal I just affirm their observation without saying well Im vegan. I might say yep I love my greens or whatever. With people that are genuinely curious Ill be sure to actually explain. Im not really into the whole guilty of being vegan. It can be depressing to meet other vegans who when I ask them if theyre veganand they dont know yet that I am they respond in this shameful yeah Im sorry please dont hate me kind of voice. So I try to avoid being like that but I also try to avoid conversations that will leave me feeling rejected and hurt. Its a practice.,vegan,cqnefyc,6,t5_2qhpm

I cant tell you what the market is like in Chile.  I know that for things like shaving brushes and shoes I basically order online I dont know how Amazon is for Chile.  For food cooking vegan typically involves going for basic ingredients.  A huge number of my recipes boil down to Rice beans vegetables spices though cooking from basic ingredients can be time consuming which might be a problem for you..  I was worried about the same thing when I went vegan.  My SO sent me a box of vegan chocolates with a note that said Whats important to you is important to me which remains the sweetest thing somebody has ever done for me.

I chose these graphic videos because they are extremely personal. You can actually feel what the animal is going through. If I was going to be slaughtered I would want that injustice to be broadcasted to the whole world so we could learn about it and stop it. The problem is not carnists being turned away. Carnists dont even think about veganism or animals. The problem is that the issue of animal rights isnt in our cultural consciousness. If we want to bring this issue to the table we need agitation.

Generally by not engaging with the issue. Its obviously wrong its almost certainly against your values too. Rant over. I think the answer to your question should be pretty obvious. Its wrong to kill other humans  does that assessment change if your life or your familys life depends on it? Of course it does!So no we arent here to judge people who dont have a choice.

Mirror test of article  Animal consciousness sfw gtThe sense in which animals or human infants can be said to have consciousness or a selfconcept has been hotly debated it is often referred to as the debate over animal minds. The best known research technique in this area is the mirror test devised by Gordon G. Gallup in which the skin of an animal or human infant is marked while it is asleep or sedated with a mark that cannot be seen directly but is visible in a mirror. It is then allowed to see its reflection in a mirror if the animal spontaneously directs grooming behaviour towards the mark that is taken as an indication that it is aware of itself.

Dont tell me its about health when no one blinks an eye at a skinny person scarfing down snacks and fast food and never exercising but if a heavier person eats a snack they get looked at like should you really be eating that...Judging peoples health by their weight is a pretty bad indicator. Overweight people can be active and healthy. Have you never looked at weightlifters outside of the conventionally attractive ones? There are overweight athletes even competing in the Olympics.

I am advocating that we leave animals alone.And I am advocating that we use all possible resources including biological ones. Animals are useful and theyre not people. Thats all the moral justification necessary for people to use them. gt.  You are valuing human progression over everything else.  The progression of humans doesnt require exploitation of animals.  Also mentally retarded humans will never be the best and brightest.  We care for these people because we have empathy and they have a right to live as well.The progression of humans is eased by exploitation of resources. Necessity never mattered. gt.  Slave societies werent necessary to produce Plato.  Plato would have been generated regardless.  Again you are valuing human success over the exploitation of other humansanimals.  If there was a lab that could improve the human condition by doing experiments on you that would kill you or performing a vivisection I would oppose it in every way I could.  Even if I hated you as a person I would do everything I could to protect you from being tortured even in the name of science.  And I bet you wouldnt want to be the target of such an experiment.  Slaves dont want to be slaves either.  And animals dont want to be murdered.  Whether they want to or not is rather irrelevant isnt it? Again you havent said one thing that convinces me what animals want should trump what humans want. gtIts easier to live life selfishly as you do and ignore the pain others experience.  But if you were feeling that amount of pain you would wish that someone would save you.  If you saw your own family enslaved raped and tortured you would wish that someone was fighting for them.

It is looking like we dont know as much as we thought we did about celiac which was never very much because people also have celiaclike reactions to corn and rice protein as well. Luckily my sensitivity stops after oats. Odds are good theres more than just the glutenin and gliadin proteins causing celiac disease in some people and maybe even specific sections of specific protein molecules which may explain why some celiacs never react to barley but wheat and rye are the devil. Its a complicated pain in the ass. The Montana brand I found is a very specific species of oat that has a lower percentage of a certain protein that some believe causes celiaclike reactions. I ate them in very small quantities every day for a week as a part of a research study and did okay but when I had a normal sized bowl for breakfast some time later I reacted.

4060920,0,t1_crj5gdk,People will cling to that kind of ideas and rationalizations to feel a little better  I wholly disagree with this line of reasoning. However I do believe that the way our food is produced is a single but essential cog in a machine designed to separate the rich from the poor politically socially economically or whathaveyou and an effect of that is that meat consumption raises.  As a result of the highlyindustrialized monoculture food production whether it is fields of soy or cows small farmers and local communities are being pushed out of existence making way for massive factories to push out a WHOLE lot of cheap food. I think this has at least two major implications.  gt A. Nearly all of our food is produced in a very centralized area intended to ship across the country by a very small number of people   of the population are farmers and that is still declining. Because of this extreme density of food production paired with the binary of nearly zero production in certain areas creates a phenomenon known as Food Deserts A Food desert is essentially a geographical region that doesnt have access to good healthy foods but instead foods more similar fast food  which is primarily meat oriented. Its fast easy and cheap to produce an abundant amount of subpar quality cow and chicken for super cheap.and  gt B. The way we farm allows for things like the CornishCrossesCornishRocks chickens These chickens have been intensively bread for conditions of industrial factory farming making it SUPER cheap and SUPER easy to produce an incredible amount of product. These chickens lifespan is roughly around  weeks  their traditional nonindustrial meat producing chicken lifespan is at least  weeks. This environment to produce this type of breeding can only happen in industrial factory farms and industrial factory farms can only exist in a political and economic climate such as ours.So no the argument isnt Capitalism makes people eat meat! AGGHGHAHAH!!!! but a much more nuanced and thought out narrative that says that our capitalist system has inadvertently created the climate for excessiveunethical meat production because it is beneficial to both the politicians and capitalists to keep the industrial farms open.,vegan,crj6atj,3,t5_2qhpm

4112123,0,t1_crosv1a,Its obviously not mutually exclusive for some people to promote welfare reforms and other people to explicitly promote veganism. But in the grand scheme of things money and time and resources are going to go somewhere. For example suppose petafarm sanctuarymfaetc have ten million dollars to spend they may choose to spend it to help pass legislation to phase in over the course of several years regulations that would give egg laying hens x number of square inches of space in california. An abolitionist would say that spending all of that money  and time on educating people about veganism would be more effective in helping animals. When it comes to dollars and time using them for two different campaigns is mutually exclusive.Those who promote welfare reforms as necessary or useful tend to frame vegan advocacy as extremely hard or at least ineffective. In personal experience I find the opposite is true. Frankly I have converted several family and friends over a short period of time and it is precisely because I focus on veganism and animal use itself. If I only discussed egregious cruelty and factory farming methods and avoiding educating people about veganism for fear of offending someone those people still would have had the same amount of moral concern stoked but most likely would have directed it towards buying cage free eggs or crate free pork.In addition I think its hard to deny that by supporting these welfare reforms one is inherently normalizing the idea that its possible to use animals humanely. How many times have you heard the phrase thats why I only eat cage free eggs or thats why I buy grass fed butter. These campaigns really do make people feel better about their continued consumption of animal products. ,vegan,crp0a3a,3,t5_2qhpm

I knew obviously I was eating an animal and that it was killed so I could eat it but I had no idea the amount of suffering they had to go through. I thought it was just a quick and painless death.

There are a couple which say that this story is not accurate and the rest are going on and on about how people are hypocrites.So what is this thread about? Are we simply pointing out the hypocrisy of omnivores or are we defending PETA? Perhaps we are doing both but pointing out the hypocrisy is not defending PETA.Jesus guys...how many times do I have to repeat this?I thought it was a fairly straight forward point.You arent defending anything by calling people hypocrites youre just name calling.,vegan,crq7dwm,0,t5_2qhpm

4176722,0,t1_crw0nmx,Actually I loved the flavor of meat before going vegan. My favorite foods were barbecue bacon cheeseburgers and pulled pork plus Im Puerto Rican so it was a huge part of my culture. Still never felt like a sacrifice.Perhaps the men you hang out with are terrible immature people? My husband has not gotten shit from any of his older friends many of them either religious and genderrole obsessed or in the military nothing from his family same description applies and nothing from the many vegan men we hang out with on a regular basis because my husband isnt the only attractive intelligent man I know either. Im not saying what youre describing doesnt exist at all but Im saying its not as prevalent as you seem to thing and it sure as shit isnt a reason to continue contributing to the mass exploitation and slaughter of billions of animals. Just because YOU cant articulate a difference between sympathy empathy and compassion doesnt mean that there isnt a difference and it also doesnt mean that being vegan is dependent on any of those things. I dont randomly slaughter people and it has nothing to do with compassion empathy or sympathy. It has to do with having a basic moral and a basic ethical framework. It is not right to needlessly kill others. Now if I were to think really hard about the act of slaughtering a family empathy would kick in and I would feel extreme pain myself  but this is because I am a deeply empathetic person. However the decision to not kill people came long before I put myself in the place of the family we are discussing here. My veganism comes from a place of logic and rationality not empathy. My husband while an incredibly kind person has next to no sense of empathy at all. The transition to veganism was much easier and quicker for him than it was for me.Not being vegan is just downright illogical and unethical. ,vegan,crwco4q,0,t5_2qhpm

The truth is on your side  all the most common antivegan arguments are full of fallacies inconsistencies and plain ignorance. But it doesnt matter that you can squash their arguments in a debate  they are not going to acknowledge that they are wrong and they are not going to change.You want to get better at debates?

However the slaves would probably rather be freed as a consequence of industrialization today rather than wait for humanity to finally get its shit together and behave morally at some undetermined point in the future.That applies in modern times as well.

And then as I got used to the diet I found there were always ways I could get cooked veggies to taste good.  Experiment with different oils including coconut and sesame.  Both will lend a unique flavour to the veggies.  Try making stir frys that are loaded with fresh garlic and ginger has to be fresh.Take a cooking class.  Take a cooking class if its possible.  Get to know a variety of veggies and their methods of preparation.Supplement with a shake to start if necessary.  I still have a vegetablebased protein shake a lot of days just to be on the safe side for my protein and to squeeze in some more veggies.And finally soups.

If taking one every day is too annoying you can find supplements with higher doses that you take once a week but then you should take an exponentially higher amount not just the sum of daily doses.You dont need to panic over this right now because if you werent deficient before your body is very good at storing B for years.

Every aspect of the military is meant for very specific things that dont exactly align with a pacifist or all lies are valuable moral code. I think if a vegan cant support the idea of killing animals for food wouldnt it be a bit odd for that same vegan to work for and support the military and part of being in the military is that they may get sent out to war someday? Not just infantry as you already know. The Air Force Navy Army Marines... every aspect of the military is designed for the potential of war. Now Im not making a statement about the morality of being in the military... Im just saying that it doesnt really seem to line up with the moral code of a vegan.Yes a member of the military may never even have to point a weapon at another person. A cop might never have to either. But signing up for that requires the acknowledgement of the fact that their service may involve using a weapon or helping others do the same. And it is for that reason that it just doesnt seem morally consistent for a serious vegan to enter the service. They would have responsibilities that conflict with their entire lifestyle. Thats more my point not Everyone in the military kills people.,vegan,csfhjhu,5,t5_2qhpm

This is a case where a parent is teaching her child her ethical beliefsthat eating animals is acceptable due to her religion and the healthiness of the meat. While I absolutely think it is wrong to eat animals it feels hypocritical to criticize this mother when shes doing what all of us will do with our children.

4384572,0,t3_3b813d,Hey RG Why not do a street tasting review? What I mean is cook up the food bring it on the street and let others try it out in return for them letting you showcase them on your show. Itll also give a great perspective for nonvegans trying it out since many of your recipes are made to be a vegan analogue to much of Filipino cuisines nonveganness.The issue I see with emailing the recipes out is a few things Different ingredients. Some of your recipes call for ingredients such as coconut vinegar just from looking at the longganisa recipe which might be rather difficult to find. While there may be ingredients that can be subbed in e.g. if coconut vinegar cannot be found white vinegar could probably work it will affect the end result to a degree. Time constraints. People who help you out with this are going to be doing it on their own free time but youve also got a schedule youre probably trying to stay true to. Or at the very least in the future if you wish to make Youtube a suitable stream of revenue youll need to set deadlines for when videosrecipesetc. come out. Cooking proficiencyskill. I am by no means saying the stuff youre making is difficult RG. But I can only speak for myself. There are some people who might really want to help you out but might just be a little less proficient behind the stove. That skill level might make or break a recipe when theyre first trying it out.Lastly free food!. People love free stuff! Im sure youll get a few people to help you out with making the recipes too and giving feedback but I am also sure youll end up getting way more people if youre out on the street offering free food to try out.Anyways I hope this helps out a bit and good luck RG! Cant wait to see what you whip up next.JohnP.S. to give an example of how you could layout the street tasting system I can offer this video series Food Mashups from the channel Tasted as an example.

4423221,0,t3_3boh8i,Im excited to be hosting this year so Im making lots of vegan dishes! Im making veggie hot dogs bbq lentils quinoa broccoli slaw macaroni salad deviled eggs and red velvet cupcakes. Found recipes for all this on pinterest ,vegan,cso8odx,1,t5_2qhpm
4427079,0,t3_3bow4s,Thai curried lentils. I made this last night.I usually cook my lentils in a rice cooker for a long time while Im at work or something and then I either cook brown rice or quinoa. I think quinoa is better for this dish.For the curry in a dutch oven cast iron meant for the stove I start with a tablespoon or two of coconut oil. Then I put in  or so tablespoons of panang curry and a diced onion and stir fry that for  minutes or so. Then I add  or so table spoons of coconut cream you can use coconut milk dont get the low fat kind. I mix this all together then I add a couple tablespoons of coconut or palm sugar couple tablespoons of peanut butter you can throw in some whole peanuts if you wish and then . tablespoons of fish sauce google around for vegan fish sauces Ive made this before. The fish sauce is really to taste so play around with how much you want. I mix this stuff all together then I usually add a pint of water. Add a bunch of lentils probably about  cups cooked lentils. Add more water if need be this will be simmering for a while. Meanwhile boil  smaller potatoes cubed in salt water.Now I usually slice an eggplant into in slices. I salt each side and let them sit on paper towels. I usually do this before I start the curry. After theyve sat for a while grill them on a george foreman or bake them in a baking sheet with some oil.After eggplant is done cut it up into chunks add to curry. After potatoes are done strain add to curry. Add more of the can of coconut cream to finish off. I usually use  of a can for this dish use more if you want. Mix it all the final consistency should be thick not too watery not quite the consistency of black bean soup thicker. Taste add more fish sauce if need be or more sugar. And then serve this over quinoa. I usually garnish with chopped thai basil.On Sundays I make a big ol pot of this and eat it during the week I never get sick of it.EDIT You might want to do  whole eggplants if you really like eggplant I do. Also shitake mushrooms are an excellent addition same with baby corns and chiles. You can add most anything to this dish.,vegan,csoq389,1,t5_2qhpm

4441791,1,t1_csqjewl,gt I think guns tend to take away peoples freedom.I disagree. Guns are how you guarantee your freedom. The first step of every tyrant is to disarm the population. Guns are not evil and do not prevent others from pursuing their freedoms. Conversely I think thats exactly what they protect. gt I think it should be at the very least heavily regulated not heavily fined in such a way that you need to sit very thorough competency tests and examinations to be able to own one. I cant say that I really agree with this either. The idea being that the right to owning weaponsfirearms in particular in selfdefense is an innate human right recognized by the founding documents of this country. Should we have to take a competency test to ensure that we should be allowed to speak freely? Surely there are plenty of people who abuse their right to free speech. Human beings only have two ways to deal with one another reason and force. If you want me to do something for you you have a choice of either convincing me via argument or force me to do your bidding under threat of force. Every human interaction falls into one of those two categories without exception. Reason or force thats it. In a truly moral and civilized society people exclusively interact through persuasion. Force has no place as a valid method of social interaction and the only thing that removes force from the menu is the personal firearm as paradoxical as it may sound to some. When I carry a gun you cannot deal with me by force. You have to use reason and try to persuade me because I have a way to negate your threat or employment of force. The gun is the only personal weapon that puts a pound woman on equal footing with a pound mugger a year old retiree on equal footing with a year old gang banger and a single guy on equal footing with a carload of drunk guys with baseball bats. The gun removes the disparity in physical strength size or numbers between a potential attacker and a defender. There are plenty of people who consider the gun as the source of bad force equations. These are the people who think that wed be more civilized if all guns were removed from society because a firearm makes it easier for a armed mugger to do his job. That of course is only true if the muggers potential victims are mostly disarmed either by choice or by legislative fiatit has no validity when most of a muggers potential marks are armed. People who argue for the banning of arms ask for automatic rule by the young the strong and the many and thats the exact opposite of a civilized society. A mugger even an armed one can only make a successful living in a society where the state has granted him a force monopoly. Then theres the argument that the gun makes confrontations lethal that otherwise would only result in injury. This argument is fallacious in several ways. Without guns involved confrontations are won by the physically superior party inflicting overwhelming injury on the loser.People who think that fists bats sticks or stones dont constitute lethal force watch too much TV where people take beatings and come out of it with a bloody lip at worst. The fact that the gun makes lethal force easier works solely in favor of the weaker defender not the stronger attacker. If both are armed the field is level. The gun is the only weapon thats as lethal in the hands of an octogenarian as it is in the hands of a weight lifter. It simply wouldnt work as well as a force equalizer if it wasnt both lethal and easily employable. When I carry a gun I dont do so because I am looking for a fight but because Im looking to be left alone. The gun at my side means that I cannot be forced only persuaded. I dont carry it because Im afraid but because it enables me to be unafraid. It doesnt limit the actions of those who would interact with me through reason only the actions of those who would do so by force. It removes force from the equation... and thats why carrying a gun is a civilized act.,vegan,csqkman,2,t5_2qhpm

4452399,0,t3_3c2zev,Im the same. The best thing to do is educate slowly state your opinion but tell the person youre describing it to that you dont want to force it upon others. Remember you were in the spot of others. Just hint that you watched a documentary called earthlings that really changed your eyes or maybe cowspiracy if you want to talk more about the environmental impact but dont make the meat eater feel bad for eating meat. You were there too once. You came to the conclusion on your own and you have to let others as well. Im a recent vegetarian  months transitioning to vegan and my friends dont really understand why but they ask questions occasionally because I dont always force my new view and opinions down on them. I think thats the best part. We had a vegetarian roommate once who always went off about saving the animals and how terrible human beings are for eating meat..... like... now I understand her point but she went about it all wrong. She just made us mad at her for pretty much telling us we were horrible human beings and less than her because our eyes hadnt been opened yet.You cant make others feel bad about their eating choice you just have to give them a gentle push to look for themselves. You dont wnat them to resent vegans or vegetarians. Show that you can eat healthy and youre a lot happier with your new lifestyle ,vegan,csrwqsx,4,t5_2qhpm

I disagree that the vast majority of people dont care the vast majority of people answer that its wrong to harm animals unnecessarily and say that animal welfare is a top criteria in purchasing.

Just crack open a can of beans black beans mixed beans pinto etc mix with cooked brown rice in a pan and add some veggies like onions peppers spinach etc. Add cumin and hot sauce and serve with salsa and avocado. Another good breakfast is oatmeal. Just soak oats overnight or for at least an hour in almond milk sprinkle with cinnamon and a touch of maple syrup chop some nuts of choice in and sprinkle in chia andor flax seeds.

4745960,0,t3_3fx0ce,When I pay attention and really concentrate on eating healthy which is most of the time during the week I follow a McDougall style diet which is basically .  I rarely eat raw though because too many raw veggies tend to upset my stomach.  A daily menu might look like this...Breakfast Two potatoes cut into french fry shapes and baked no oil and dipped into a bit of ketchup and mustard.  Lunch  A Jeff Novick SNAP meal which stands for Simple Nutritious Affordable Plan.  I boil a oz bag of frozen veggies and oz frozen collard greens with a can of diced tomatoes and a little water with some garlic powder and dried thyme for about  minutes.  I then add in a cup of cooked brown rice.  Its a giant meal that only has like  calories and is pretty much .Dinner  Some steamed carrots broccoli and mushrooms served over brown rice with a brown Asian sauce recipe that I discovered that is oil free and delicious.  I may or may not also add some baked tofu.  If I need a snack I have some bananas or apples or some home made hummus that is oil and tahini free or very little tahini on fat free crackers Wasa makes McDougall friendly crackers or rice cakes.  Sometimes the late evening munchies hit and I like some fat free pretzels dipped in an agave and dijon mustard mixture.  Ive lost over  pounds eating like this carbs at every meal and very little exercise not that I recommend not doing any exercise.  My daily intake is around  to  calories.  Switch out some oatmeal for the potatoes at breakfast and dont eat the entire SNAP meal and its real easy to drop that to  calories.  EDIT  I do eat beans and lentils too...  I make chili fairly often and have that mixed with brown rice for dinner a few times a week.  ,vegan,ctsru97,2,t5_2qhpm

Its my understanding that there really is a lot more to morality than mere emotions but not being an expert in the field I am not the person to convince you of this and I defer again to my overarching claim that you have not successfully refuted the possibility of moral realism.,vegan,cu788nq,1,t5_2qhpm

And it is the obvious choice  but only in hindsight!You didnt choose to be participating in torture you were brought up with it. The right thing to do is stop but the bigger effect you can have is awakening other people to the issue. If you find your voice before you find the resolve to change your habits then speak up or help the animals in whatever way you can. If you are someone who passionately speaks up for animals and understands the unavoidablebrutality of the entire industry and understands that these animals want to live their lives then the habit change will likely follow pretty naturally once you engage with the issues.

5019801,0,t1_cur26dz,gt I dont think its an accurate stereotype nor do I think people complaining means that the net effect is negative. There are people who feel theyre being preached to when you merely tell them what youre eating for lunch. I dont put much stock in stereotyping complainers.Most vegans arent like that of course but the loud minority is hated by many. People complaining about it means theyre irritated by it rather than convinced by its message. And there are a lot of them. All stereotypes have a bit of truth to them and the reason I pointed out the one about the preachy vegans is not to say that its representative of vegans as a whole but to illustrate the fact that that type of vegan is likely to push a LOT of people away. I think a different strategy is better. Aggressive tactics are what people pushing ideologies that have no legs to stand on always resort to. Vegans have enough facts behind them to go a different route. Sure certain people are overly sensitive but this isnt about them. This is about the tactics vegans use not how some overly sensitive person perceives them. gtIm not sure what this has to do with the current discussion. I was saying that I was pushed away by pushy vegans too. I dont think pushiness is the answer as much as addressing the actual concerns of nonvegans which is mainly their own lives. You dont need to use emotional arguments or arguments that generally work only once you have the mindset of a vegan. gt Some people are over sensitive and always looking for a reason to feel like a victim. No matter how nice you are or how naturally the topic is raised some people will feel hurt and complain. This is unavoidable. My  cents.If thats the case than how is being pushy going to help? Just forget about those particular people and move on. But youre much more likely to reach them by relating to them and understanding them than by preaching to them. ,vegan,cur2sff,4,t5_2qhpm

I dont know where youd even remotely infer that from.Maybe I misread but your argument appears to be until land ownership is abolished individuals dont have responsibility for their actions.  If Im wrong in my reading of your comments above I apologize but thats really how its coming across which is why Im disagreeing.I think regardless of land ownership we all do have responsibility to act morally which is why Im vegan.  Animals are still killed and abused but I have decided to stop funding their abuse.  Its a drop in the bucket sure but at least its something and it has made a small impact because less meat is being produced now because people are eating less meat and theres more vegetarians amp vegans around to spur demand for alternatives.gt If land ownership isnt going anywhere then neither is factory farming. If you arent aware of this then I dont know what to say. Supply and demand is a myth when demand can be manufactured.I never said it was going anywhere.  But I dont want to support it so I dont.  Short of a fullscale revolution with mass casualties on both sides I dont see how youre going to abolish land ownership either... so both of our solutions are flawed.  Were both wishing for something thatll probably never happen.The only difference is that vegans are doing something about it now rather than sitting back and saying well until factory farms are abolished Im going to continue to eat meat since theres really no point in trying its the systems fault not mine.gt The USSR and China were crony capitalist fascist industrial states they do not represent even a slight example of the Left. Even an ideal version of their supposed model is not what Im talking about.Then Im not understanding what youre talking about.  Ive read the Communist Manifesto and a fair amount about the ideals of collective ownership over the years and it sounds good in theory but is completely unrealistic in practice I think.  If people dont have a personal incentive to work hard to improve their land and increase yields and if the government is just going to take their entire harvest and allot them a fixed amount per year why would they do anymore than the bare necessity?Its essentially the tragedy of the commons writ large.

Remember theyve been eating high carb for years and years so their metabolisms caught up. You will initially gain weight. If youre eating  calories a day youre starving and when it catches up to you youre going to put on a lot of weight without having had your metabolism catch up. McDougall and the doctors have all based their diets on science. Watch any of their presentations to see why. RT is also based in science. Metabolism adapts science calls it BMR or adaptive thermogenesis or other things. RT is designed to keep a low insulin rate. Insulin bulks you up FAST. Fructose doesnt elicit insulin so fruit keeps you lean. Also look up the Minnesota starvation experiment to see what happens when people starve on  calories a day. Do you want to be as lean as Freelee? Follow her advice. Freelee was kg at . Now look at her. Are you going to listen to someone who lost a ton of weight and is lean year round? Who are you taking your advice from? Judge by sustained results. Of course Freelee cycles you should do some type of exercise but eating hclf longterm at least  years will slim you down. Its faster if you exercise.  All of the Doctors Barnard McDougall Greger Klaper Essylstyn etc are LEAN. High carb low fat makes you lean. Carbs keep you slim fat makes you fatEdit Also note that freelee doesnt eat whatever she wants. She eats high carb low fat. If she started punding down steaks shed get fat. Also note that unlimited means minimum  calories and then more until full. It doesnt mean shove barrels of rice down your gullet until you puke. ,vegan,curo43j,-3,t5_2qhpm

It can be discouraging when the vast majority of people around you find nothing wrong with eating animal products.In Vegucated the young Hispanic woman initially was committed to veganism but she ended up compromising on vegetarianism because there was so much social pressure.Andre  stopped being vegan after like a decade because he wasnt able to have normal social interaction.

5029422,0,t3_3jtrlf,I think if we want to respect animals we have to first consider their point of view. What is important to an animal? Her life. All animals fight for their lives. Her body freedom from pain and injury. Her freedom to move and display natural behaviors whether that be frolick swim sex graze hunt chase play groom sunbath etc.  Her relationships and family. This is species dependent cows for example form very strong life long bonds with their babies and grieve when their families are broken up. Chickens and pigs also are extremely social animals who have families. A shark on the other hand would not bond with her babies.If we are going to credibly talk about ethics we need to keep these things in mind as we move forward in the conversation.As for point  if you are talking about the animals we over bred to be sick and docile thats true. While there are feral chickens pigs and cows they are not well equipt to survive in the wild. In fact they are all predisposed to various discomforts maladies and death based on the way they are bred. For example Egg hens are prone to reproductive disorders like getting blockages where they can die as the eggs pile up inside and cancers and can fracture their legs because they lose too many minerals to the eggs. They are bred to lay about  eggs per year their wild cousins lay . Wikipedia touches on osteoporosis in these birds Broiler meat chickens are bred to grow so fast that if not killed at  weeks old as they usually are in industry they may actually collapse under their own weight. They tend to over eat and to keep them healthy beyond their childhood is a challenge because they may develop neurotic behaviors if you restrict their food but also will eat themselves to death if you dont. Wikipedia talks at length about them.So these animals would have a rough time in the wild but its also clearly not ethical to breed them this way at all. Chickens are in worse shape than cows and pigs but the same could be said there. As for actually wild animals  yes there is some suffering. But there is something else important that no farm animal really has. Life freedom the pursuit of happiness all the behaviors I listed above and the chance to stay with and protect their families. Whats more there is a lot of pleasure in the natural world  I refer you to the book Pleasurable Kingdom by John Balcomb. Raising animals for their flesh means they are here for our reasons and everything in the bullet points above is taken from them. Even farms where they try to do better tear families apart and kill all of the animals as babies For example here is one of the better dairies watch a mother lose her baby who will die so that humans can have the milk she produces for him. Secondarily because animals also need to eat and they use the energy they eat to stay warm and move the little they are allowed we end up clearing far more land and releasing far more greenhouse gas to feed the animals we abuse and murder than we would if we ate plants. So by creating sick animals who couldnt survive without our help and abusing those animals and killing them as babies we are depriving wild animals of their habitats and thus their chance to live too.   and an illustration of the issue. Killing an animal gently isnt nothing its absolutely everything to that animal. The right thing to do is obvious welcome!,vegan,cus8jtt,3,t5_2qhpm

I raise larva for to add protein to their diet. I put them in fenced in pens that are larger than  meters square with less than  chickens in each pen and allow them to forage and graze the area. This allows them to eat all of the unwanted plants and eat the insects that lay eggs in the cherry and apple fruit trees. The fence isnt so much to make a prison for them as it is to keep foxes and weasels out. Pigs on the other hand make amazing tractors. I tell ya if you want to clear some land dont use a tractor to plow just ferment some grain and throw it where you want them to dig and they will go to town! They are also superior for making ponds. They love to play in the mud and they seal the ponds very well before filling them with water.Fish can be put in ponds or tanks and the water from there can be used to irrigate plants. Animals bring the nutrition to the land and they are a major player in the true health of the ecosystem.,vegan,cuw46yy,2,t5_2qhpm

5151019,0,t1_cv6s2ii,First let me say thanks for the long and nice response. Discourse is great. Second Im on mobile  so I hope this isnt a horrible garbled mess.gt However there is evidence to suggest that making people feel bad about their weight only exacerbates the problemI dont understand why the only two options are fat shaming or normalizing gorging on salted caramel icecream vegan cake vegan cupcakes and whatever vegan feast was written about in a manner that truly disturbed me. We are fully capable of saying as a community that eating yourself to ill health is counter productive to our movement while not saying gross fatty go die everyone hates you. Undereating isnt the only eating disorder its just the far less common one.gtBut then there are the health vegans who only have a plant based diet are probably slim and fit and wear skins or use products tested on animals. They agree with youI feel this is setting up a false dichotomy. There are also healthy fit real vegans who dont wear skins or products tested on animals and they agree with me too.gtIm sure that many vegans smoke  the physical signs of this are not as visible compared to a person who is overweight but yet seen as more socially acceptable because theyre slim. Do we berate the smokers out there in a similar way?The signs of smoking are readily apparent. Smokers have yellowed fingernails yellowed teeth and smell of smoke constantly. Smokers are the single most maligned social group right behind pedophiles and jihadists. Every smokers doctors appointment literally begins with a treatise against smoking people regularly make rude and angry comments to people smoking. You cant smoke in restaurants in front of buildings you cant even work in many hospital jobs if you test positive for nicotine! Imagine if you were barred a job in healthcare because your blood sugar was too high! Smoking has literally been the target of a western crusade since the s and has been in free fall since. The biggest difference in the two populations is youll never hear a smoker saying its OK to smoke. They all admit its a nasty habit that they would quit if they could. The people eating to excess rarely ever do this and frequently make blog posts and social media campaigns justifying their habits.gtWe are more likely to look at a person who is underweight and have sympathyempathy or even be slightly envious that they have so much self control. I propose that they are an equal and opposite problem.I propose that these are both problems on opposite ends of the spectrum but no where in the realm of being equal problems.  of Americans are overweight. Being overweight is easy because food tastes fucking great and exercise takes effort. No one views anorexia as healthy but every day there are new efforts to redefine health in its relationship to obesity. I get it no one wants to hear the path theyre on is leading to ill health but pretending healthy obesity exists doesnt help anyone.gtbeing obese obviously will lead to horrid diseases shortened life span and diminished quality of life. I am pretty sure that in such cases there will be evidence of mental illness which may have preceded the weight gain or occurred as a result of mental illness.This is only if you literally define Obesity as a mental illness. People get obese because life is stressful processed food is a drug and people are tired and effort takes energy. Tying everything to mental health is a cop out like youre not allowed to talk about this subject....because mental health. How do we care so much about mental health and not one bit about physical health?Look Im  for a big ole vegan tent. Bring your sick your wary your sodomites and your seventh day Adventists bring your Democrats and your Republicans you anarchists and your socialists lets all party together and celebrate a lifestyle devoid of unnecessary animal suffering. In doing so however we need to recognize that health is a marketing tool. Its a weapon we should have  times out of a  over Omnis. When we start putting out these I eat to excess and Im proud of it pieces were nurturing a lifestyle that literally helps no one. Not the person doing the overeating not the prospective vegan that is turned off by the panoply of health maladies the vocal vegan has and not the animals due to the less effective message as well as the overconsumption.

To suggest this was some conspiracy would make for a LOT of people being involved.If you look it up this story concludes with PETA being let off the hook because the family were renting a house and the property owner had allowed PETA to go in and catch any stray dogs even those the chihuahua was allegedly on their rentals porch. Since the property owner said it was okay charges couldnt be pressed. PETA really had no reason to take the chihuahua. And the poor animal was dead before anyone could even do anything about it...thats telling as well.Thanks for the Snopes link I hadnt seen that neighbourhood ad before.

5227474,0,t1_cvg1dz3,Im not saying we should ignore human exploitation Im saying that the market is not the place to address it.  Fair trade doesnt mean workers arent being exploited it just means that theyre not being exploited to the especially heinous extent typical of the developing world.  And buying from the second hand market is irrelevant because those goods still had to be produced in the first place.  All youre doing is buying them at a different point in their life cycle.  Obviously thats not a solution that could possibly scale to everyone anyhow because if everyone buys commodities secondhand we pretty rapidly run out of commodities.  Making things yourself admittedly is free of capitalist exploitation well I mean except to the extent that youre going to have to buy means of production for your own use that were themselves produced by exploited workers but thats also not any kind of a scalable solution.  Capitalism has restructured our entire economy around the production and consumption of commodities by capitalist enterprises its not really something you can opt out of as an individual.If you want to address capitalist exploitation you have to do it headon through politics.  The idea that we all need to try to make the world a better place by patronizing the capitalists who do the least harm is an idea that benefits only the capitalist class and keeps them in power.  By buying into it youre implicitly accepting the premise that the economy should be directed by those who can marshal the most money to a cause and then setting out in vain to try to direct enough of the comparatively small monetary resources controlled by the working class to outweigh the massive fortunes of the capitalist class.  And thats never gonna happen.  Their money outnumbers ours but that only matters if we accept that we have to play by their rules.  If we opt for democracy instead and truly embrace the notion that every person deserves an equal say in how things are run then we outnumber them.,vegan,cvg3o7m,5,t5_2qhpm

Upping your portions is probably a really good idea...  I also made the switch over night and because I didnt know how I was going to react decided to make life easy and just eat whatever I wanted whenever I felt like it instead of watching portions and whatnot.  I ate soooo much!  Like way more than normal.  It took a couple days to get back to a normal appetite again and looking back I think it was partially due to the fact that I was eating things that were easier to digest and also because I was missing a lot of calories from my normal meals eating the same sandwiches minus the cheese and mayo and so on plus the fact that a lot of vegan foods are lower calorie that my body was used to getting.I cant say I felt anything negative though.

5315433,0,t1_cvqanw2,It was only a few months ago I felt I was having a tough time with all the confrontations and frustrations from my loved ones. It extremely important to know when to keep cool and when to discuss it in depth.I read a book called Vegan Freak which helped a lot. Rule number one is to never discuss it at the dinner table. Instead ask the nonvegan to approach you after their meal if they really want to know more. Talking about veganism whilst someone is eating meat never ends well as defensiveness is at its highest. Other than that I keep my anger and frustration to my animal rights website and twitter so its not directed at anyone in particular unless they choose to take it personally and lead by example in every day life. Ive done vegan pizza nights for friends given them vegan cook books for birthdays and told them about all the fun vegan events Ive been to. Just basically show that youre not missing out on anything and its adding so much more.I spent such a long time feeling so much despair and depression after watching Earthlings. My husband and I used to argue about veganism every single week. It was bad at the beginning. But now I have so much positivity in only a few months. The vegan revolution is growing rapidly on YouTube and other social media and I really think it will be as mainstream as vegetarianism in the next few years. ,vegan,cvr3xqu,2,t5_2qhpm

Assuming the cow was killed for beef it is more respectful to put the rest to good use as opposed to simply wasting it.gt The steak comparison is because the bones are just as much a part of an animal as the meat is and every bit makes their deaths more profitable. Beef cattle are just that cows raised for beef. Anything else their remains are used for is great but hardly the primary purpose for it being raised and slaughtered.,vegan,cvrnsl5,2,t5_2qhpm

And youll cook it in much the same way you would cook tofu.Two major differences. You do have to cook it youre not supposed to eat it raw. And its very dry compared to tofu. So you wont have to squeeze water out but it can be unappetizing if theres not some sort of sauce or other food item cooked with it to give it moisture.I typically pan fry it like Id pan fry tofu.

If its exported to another country or state then they get the water stored within. Water that goes towards animals doesnt just disappear its put back into the ground though animal waste and other processes. Nothing just disappears it just transforms or is moved.For example humans are gt water correct? If you spent your whole life in CA drinking Californian water and then went to China where you suddenly passed away that water in your body suddenly goes into Chinese soil once you decompose. The same applies to all other animal and plant based agriculture.So any animal fed local crops and eaten locally will eventually return all water back to that area.

5524676,0,t1_cwhg21m,gt The issue was never price its availability. In the third world you dont know what or when you may be able to eat. So you eat what you can when you can you dont refuse what might be one of only a couple meals in a week because you dont like it. Im sure everyone knows this but it seems to miss the point entirely.  Food in third world countries is not generated out of a magic hole in the ground it is being grown.  In many cases it is also being processed and transported.  The cost of doing those things is in the majority of climates and for most people is cheaper and more efficient for grains than it is for meat.  Meaning if grains replaced meat worldwide more people would be eating more often.gtAlso where are the prices based on? Those numbers are  completely meaningless since different items cost drastically different prices in different places. The numbers might still be accurate to some degree in one place but the manner in which they are presented is garbage and does not do anything to prove the point it is trying to prove. Given that Ive never heard the accusation that veganism is a first world luxury from anyone who doesnt either live in a first world country or rely on transported foodstuffs I think this graph does everything to prove the point it is trying to prove.  In industrial agriculture grains are cheaper and more efficient to feed people with than meats usually by at least one order of magnitude.As for the prices being different in different places of course.  Heck prices dont even matter for purely subsistence farmers trying to eek by on a small farm that includes a few chickens and one cow.  Im sure they exist but in all my life Ive yet to actually meet a single vegan who argues that subsistence farmers should stop living off of goats that graze in the rocky cold hills of their homeland or they should deny themselves the necessary protein from chickens who are fed almost exclusively from eating bugs around the backyard of their house.  This really comes across as special pleading yeah sure the vast majority of time and for the vast majority of people it holds true that protein from grains is cheaper and more efficient than protein from meat but there are exceptions to this.  Therefore veganism is a first world luxury.While we are at it should we ignore the obvious elephant in the room,vegan,cwhts7x,8,t5_2qhpm

Any sweetener has sugar aside from things like stevia but I stay away from the super processed stuff and is worse than no sweetener but its OK in moderation. I prefer to use raw agave nectar. No reason other than its vegan and I like it. Edit to add if youre going to stay away from honey for vegan purposes then you might not want to be buying refined cane sugar either. Go for the raw sugar coconut sugar agave bee free honee or another sweetener that doesnt use bone char in processing. ,vegan,cwuhnzv,1,t5_2qhpm

5695068,0,t3_3t4ace,Veganism and overall health are mutually exclusive and that a vegan diet based on human dietary needs and biology is technically impossible outside of the modern developed world. The biggest counter argument to that is that there are some people are vegans out of necessity due to meat being incredibly expensive or difficult to obtain in certain parts of the world. My counter to that is that those people arent by definition healthy in fact most of them are pretty sickly. This also works against people in favor of a purely carnivorous diet humans need a large variety of nutrients in order to function properly which are obtained from many different sources. Some of them happen to be meat which is why we developed the tools to process meat properly namely our digestive system and teeth. The argument against the teeth thing is that not all of them are sharp and different from other carnivores or omnivores. This is true and its because we never needed to develop teeth as a weapon even then we have a dental system that shares similarities with omnivores. If you were somehow insane enough to do something that is vegan and paleo youd pretty much die of malnutrition within short order simply because youd have to cut out what vegans use as major sources of protein that being legumes replace that with carnivorous and the same thing would happen due to a tremendous lack of fiber and other vital nutrients. Even within the modern world meat and meat products contain nutrients that if not consumed in the meat itself must be obtained through a dietary supplement in order to get the daily required amount. This is the reasoning behind veganism as a sign of a privileged diet. But meat is also privilege! Yeah but were designed to eat meat to supplement a mostly vegetarian diet. Going full vegan requires you to live what is considered an unnatural diet due to the use of artifical supplements. As stated before though the pendulum swings both ways. The truth of the matter is that meat is consumed at an abnormally high rate but that doesnt mean it shouldnt be consumed at all. I would think a proper diet would consist of a  split between nonmeat and meat but right now its pretty much the opposite. Thinking like this its easier to not eat as much meat and make sure that the meat which you DO eat werent raised on a factory farm...but good luck finding that without factoring in absurd travel costs to the local farmers market. If you really want to eat meat and live in an area that allows it take up hunting and use venison as your primary source of meat. Deer arent bred for consumption but they sure as hell have the numbers for it. They also live healthy full lives in the wild and youd be doing motorists a favor by thinning out their herds. Im not vegan and never will be but Im definitely cutting down on my meat consumption due to health reasons. I just find the idea that meat consumption is somehow evil and unnatural to be ludicrous when its pretty commonplace and how the world works. Also the fact that some species are farmed for human consumption can be argued as a reason for the species continued existence. The life expectancy and population of these animals are kept in check largely due to human interference. Without people demanding pork pigs may have very well gone extinct the same logic applies to poultry and beef. We keep these animals alive specifically to eat them and as a result theyre protected from other natural predators. As a result their life expectancy shoots up. Whether or not you consider this a life worth living is another matter entirely but you must consider the fact that animals are for the most part not sapient. They have no idea what a good life is just a concept of living. ,vegan,cx310qc,-3,t5_2qhpm

5823729,0,t3_3uz81s,Yes meat eaters love animals. Certainly most of us here in rvegan loved animals as meat eaters. The hundreds of thousands of future vegans in the world who ate meat today are no different. This belief among vegans that meat eaters dont love animals is like a poison. It denies vegans the ability to empathize with what it was like to eat meat and it exaggerates moral differences between us when in reality there are very few. Instead of saying You dont love animals if you eat meat try I think you would love being vegan because I know just how much you love animals. Hear the difference? While one exaggerates the differences between meat eaters and vegans the other shows how were the same. Not only is it a useful paradigm from which to approach activism its also helpful for anyone trying to stay sane in the face of so much cruelty. Im able to remember that even though my friends and loved ones routinely consume the carcasses of violently slaughtered animals that doesnt mean theyre bad people. In fact theyre very good people! Veganism is not the only just cause and Im well aware that there are many injustices in the world that Im blind ofjust like I was blind toward veganism when I ate meat. It is a tragedy that so many people are still blind to the destruction of animal agriculture. But I dont blame these people for eating meat.

In antinatalism that being is human in veganism that being is nonhuman. There is no harm done by abstaining from reproduction but there is inherent harm thrust upon anyone who is born just be the very nature of living. The antinatalist stance mirrors the vegan stance in my opinion. They are just concerning different victims.Id definitely suggest checking out rantinatalism.

So is it what you basically said on ?And I cant disagree with you on points  because I dont know but dietary cholesterol myth is just that a myth that it is bad and nobody has stablished correlational links because there arent. Everyone is contradicting themselves. If you look at anything that Dr. Eades said hes scientific hes thorough hes smart and hes biased... maybe but hes only one of many saying that cholesterol has been falsely accused of being the bad guy being sugar wheat or refined and processed foods. Which is the only thing I can believe right now.I dont know why Keto and Paleo are supposed to be bad for your health because of processed meat or just because of red meat? Because in most searches with the terms ketogenic diet around PubMed will bring amazing health results if not even magical. I couldnt find a SINGLE PAPER showing statistically and experimentally clear that a ketogenic diet would be bad and not recommended for anything...Im convinced of being vegan. I am confused but I wont go back to meat processed meat or even eggs. We cant do that to the planet to other humans and to ourselves. What Im not convinced is that being vegan is healthier than anything else. Actually by now I think my Paleo looked healthier because Im feeling like shit on just plants and I was feeling great with plants plus animal proteins and fats. No processed food no bread no rice... no sugar... But yes I used to eat  of meat every week. And I regret I didnt know it was so bad.I also agree that there is a lot of bullshit paleo recipes like banana bread and cawliflower pizza stuff. That is just nonsense for the real paleo ideals. I used to eat like a  vegan except with eggs and meat. I ate salads huge ammounts of cawliflower avocados salted vegetables asparagus everything but then  eggs or meat... And I was healthy. Really healthy.Ketosis is a backup system? Im not so sure about that. I have been in ketosis for longer periods than  months in a row. And while being on it Ive ride my mountain bike across trails for more than  miles Ive climbed impossible rocks before and I have ran half marathons. And I WAS NOT TIRED after doing so.

Not that it is ideal but no living conditions can be when they have these traits.Continuing with the dairy cows say youyour family ended up with a cow would you milk it? Would that still be vegan? We ended up with potty calves from time to time when the mothers would die. That sounds horrible but this was a massive farm  hectares in rural Australia so it wasnt possible to watch the animals at all times and predators would occasionally pick off a few. We even had one occasion where a cow was stuck in the mud down from the water hole and unfortunately didnt make it. We did save the calf though. We named her Piko and to this day she lives on at the neighbors farm grazing and having a great time in the open fields.Also does rvegan normally down vote this much for asking questions?

From the picture I found of the packaging it indicates that it should be taken with a meal so there is a small chance that the incorrect taking of the supplement led to the diarrhea. Its unlikely that the dose is too high because B isnt known to be toxic at high levels  your body just excretes what it doesnt need in urine.

Not because I think that eating animals in inherently wrong but the reason we avoided a Malthusian crisis is because we discovered new technology. Using GMOs and crossbreeding we managed to get higher yields and crops that were more resistant to disease and insects. Using a humane method of raising animals would take a lot more land and letting them reproduce naturally would not fill the demand for animal products. So I would still avoid humanely raised meat because I think it is unsustainable for the current world population and to be honest as the supply would be so low I would be too cheap to pay for what meat actually costs when there are so many alternatives out there that suit my needs.,vegan,cyn7urz,1,t5_2qhpm

6234150,0,t1_cyy8dpb,The standard legal form of slaughter for animals is for them to be stunned and then have their throats slit. For chickens and pigs the stunning is generally done with an electric shock and for other animals a pneumatic bolt pistol projects a metal rod into their forehead. It is claimed that this renders the animal  unconscious but if you actually look into the facts slaughterhouse workers will admit that there is no way to verify that this is the case for every single animal and indeed the process doesnt always work isnt followed routinely and indeed the stun can wear off while the animal is being killed. But regardless of the fashion of execution there isnt a justification for taking the life. It is still taking the life of a sentient being for your enjoyment ultimately.

If i remember my one psychology class correct we learned both that affective attitudes e.g. to bacon are not really effectively changed with cognitive appeal probably what he means with information and that information by itself is a poor predictor of behavior attitudes are a much better predictor and they relate to knowledge but also to normative beliefs and control beliefs. That doesnt mean the presentation cant change attitudes although I guess it also depends on the setting those womens studies classes i know encourage selfcritical thinking to quite an extent in any case more than psychology. ,vegan,cyywtqg,1,t5_2qhpm

6255899,0,t3_418ilw,I live in a town in Victoria Australia. Im pretty lucky I think. I dont eat out much so I dont know if many restaurants have vegan options but we have a Wholefoods store which sells all the fancy vegan ingredients I need wheat gluten wheat berries nooch liquid smoke etc for really cheap as well as a bunch of vegan packaged foods that are pretty expensive. I love that store though. And they have a cafe next door where you can get vegan hot chocolates and their almond milk is so delicious and creamy. I go to Melbourne every fortnight and Ive just been grabbing food from the Woolworths at Southern Cross. The other day I grabbed a vegan hotdog from Lord of the Fries which is a vegetarianvegan fast food joint. Also my normal supermarket has plenty of fresh produce and has some vegan options which is good. The thing I do struggle with is vegan art supplies. I cant really find anything good quality so Im going to have to make my own watercolours but its hard to find pure pigments here and where you can find them theyre stupid expensive soooo Im going to have to do a bulk order from Dick Blick in the future for pigments.

Do I need to be told by others that I am not a Christian simply because I follow the ideology that Christ had portrayed but I do not regularly go to church? What if I were someone who followed the ideals of Christ but still found truth within the statements of Buddha and Muhammad  does this devalue me as a Christian.And again you could give me a variety of monikers that would make what I am more specified but why do you need to selfjustify those larger groups by only allowing them to call themselves that name?Ive never asked for a pat on the back for the things I do for someone to give me a trophy or for someone to recognize me for my lifestyle and beliefs  that would make a prick to do so. But I follow a vegan lifestyle and have the mentality of ethics that is veganism  it may not be as intense as others but I do.

6412250,0,t1_czi8ei8,To be fair I do agree with a lot of what youre saying. I would clarify though the restaurant was dead quiet on this Monday evening and they were engaging with the vegan requirements regarding the veggie burger therefore I still dont understand why they dropped the ball. At the same time I did look at the menu properly afterwards and realised where my initial skim read before ordering had failed me. I kind of think that they should specify beef burger considering its a burger joint and everything they serve is a burger yet as we can see with the veggie option not everything is beef. At the same time I do admit I should have been more careful when ordering. I came to that conclusion after posting that review and was willing to leave things at that.

Overfishing is a huge problem that is rapidly depleting the oceans fish and disrupting enormous ecosystems and habitats. The above reason  bycatch creates massive amounts of suffering and death for other animals that are never even brought to market for consumption.

Once they realize its no different or better hopefully! than their dairy counterparts they will be more OPEN to vegan options in the future. Maybe they will even start buying nondairy products because it makes them feel less bloated etc overall reducing dairy purchases and consumption in the US.

The problem with your other statement is that it is incredibly difficult to demonstrate that it is actually empathy they are showing. It is also very difficult to demonstrate theory of mind in animals. It doesnt mean that ToM is a bullshit concept or smth made up to make humans seem superior. If you take human children since you can talk to them you can pinpoint in their development when they will develop this ToM. What these scientists are trying to do is something similar to these tests. They know that these animals have some type of ToM even if it might be less sophisticated then that of a human. They want to prove it determine its level of sophistication and possibly where and when it appeared in other animals evolution and also in ours.

Its completely reasonable to point out that the US has perfected volume of meat produced per workerareawhatever metric you choose with the consequence of utterly horrific conditions for the animals. Its not really replicated anywhere else in the world for cows anyway chickens live dreadful lives everywhere. The average Norwegian or Polish cow leads a much better life than the average American cow so using American numbers for everything is a problem. When arguing my case in Norway I usually leave out stuff such as water requirements etc. because most of the water used to produce beef in Norway is not spent.

But Im an honest person so I say it how it is Im a glutton and being able to eat more would be a bigger motivation to start exercising than possible health benefits. Just like I changed my diet mainly for vanity reasons didnt like looking fat with improved health just being a positive sideeffect.Also I havent heard anybody describing increased food consumption due to higher physical activity as wasteful before so that was kinda unexpected.,vegan,czv7h5t,6,t5_2qhpm
6534604,0,t1_czv7f9k,I made a mish mash of different recipes so I dont know exactly in what ratio to do it. I made a large pot full of it so the amounts are kind of improvised. Put  cup of walnuts into a food processor and blitz until you get small chunks of walnut with the consistency of cooked ground meat. Optional Cut about half a cup worth of smoked tofu into very small cubes and mix them with the walnuts. Cut  medium sized onions finely and fry them in a pan. Add the walnuts and  cups of uncooked rice. Add some bouillon powder pepper smoked paprika and regular paprika. Make sure to add enough smoked paprika as this will compensate for the smoky flavor that youd normally get from the smoked meat. Taste the filling and adjust for flavor. The best part of this recipe is that you can taste the filling without getting salmonella.  Add  flat tablespoon worth of starch powder to the mix along with a tablespoon of water. Wrap the sour cabbage leaves like you normally would. I think youll need one whole cabbage head. Put the sarma in a large pot and fill it with water to cover everything. Make the broth by adding generous amounts of vegetable stock smoked paprika and pepper. Add tons of oil to compensate for the fattiness of the meat. And then cook it for several hours like you normally would.You can also try using TVP but I havent tried that yet.,vegan,czv8az5,7,t5_2qhpm

And they may be saying Oreos are not suitable for vegans because they dont want to be limited from using whey again.  But I dont buy the crosscontamination issue as being the driver behind whats happening.  Theyre saying Oreos arent vegan in the US as well as Ive pointed out elsewhere here.As a lawyer I can tell you if the sole reason for them saying this was the crosscontamination theyd issue a statement along these linesMondelez does not use any animal products in the formulation of OREOTM cookies.  However Oreos are produced in facilities where dairy products are present.  Despite our best efforts there could be occasions of minute quantities of dairy present in some batches of OREOTM cookies for this reason.  We hope you will consider enjoying our delicious Oreo products as we develop dedicated manufacturing lines that will eventually eliminate the possibility of this kind of crosscontamination.They dont say this.  What they say is much more abstruse.  It sounds like theyre worried about crosscontamination.  In fact the statement on the Oreo UK website certainly attempts to do just that. But I dont think theyre missing an opportunity to explain the existence of a possibility of crossexamination.  I think theyre saying theyre not vegan because theres another more straightforward reason they cant claim theyre vegan.Heres the ingredient list and the things I wonder aboutSUGAR potential for bone char issue UNBLEACHED ENRICHED FLOUR WHEAT FLOUR NIACIN REDUCED IRON THIAMINE MONONITRATE VITAMIN B RIBOFLAVIN VITAMIN B FOLIC ACID Some of these could be animal derived.  Probably not but could be HIGH OLEIC CANOLA ANDOR PALM ANDOR CANOLA OIL COCOA PROCESSED WITH ALKALI HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP LEAVENING BAKING SODA ANDOR CALCIUM PHOSPHATE again probably okay but could be animal derived CORNSTARCH SALT SOY LECITHIN this is interesting since the last package of Oreos I read didnt specify Soy VANILLINAN ARTIFICIAL FLAVOR CHOCOLATE.So lets consider the last ingredient on this list.  Chocolate?  Chocolate is not an ingredient.  Chocolate is made from cocoa powder and other substances.  So yeah Id say thats suspect as well.

Soil needs time to regrow micro organisms and rest sometimes for years before it can impart its nutrients onto produce. Without time and regular crop cycles or the benefit of natural compost and fermentation this produce is basically devoid of nutrients. Spending money at health food stores is expensive but if you have decided to adopt a strict vegan diet you should consider buying at your produce at the very least from these stores as they are typically picked more recently grown organically in nutrient rich soil and full of more of the vitamins and minerals that your body needs.. ,vegan,d07vey4,1,t5_2qhpm

The actual experimenters will have controlled for this and it was hinted at but this was not shown by the Beeb. I prefer the classic video game test where pigs recognise a series of different shaped targets in different places on a screen and move a joystick to score food rewards.The goal scoring tasks etc were worse as two different sorts of physical dexterity pighuman were confused with cognitive ability.

6696396,0,t1_d0boa4k,gtto answer pretty much every antivegan argument we hearYou have completely missed the point of my post havent you?I wasnt bringing any new antivegan arguments. I wasnt bringing any antivegan arguments at allI was telling you how to make your provegan arguments more approachable in other words actually have a chance of doing something more to the average person than annoy them. That list from Vegan Sidekick about  months ago referenced from a different thread here and it is exactly part of why I felt there would be a need for this kind of post. Namely the majority of the content on that page is written for vegan audiences and it will gain absolutely no traction with nonvegans as it is horrible in exactly the ways that give vegans a bad name. Ill give some examplesgt I just like the taste Meat is often seen as just being a type of food. But it is a dead body of a once living creature. To say I just like the taste is to say Killing is justified if I like the flavour of the dead body.This statement is powerful to a vegan because it touches upon two hardcore emotional triggers that are considered good reactions by the vegan community but overreactions anywhere else. Im not exactly sure which vegan thought that rebranding animal food products as a dead body would be an effective position point. I assure you its not. For the people who understand it they will say Yes it is a dead body just like what nearly everything else eats. Even plants are dead bodies. In fact the only way to get away from that is chemosynthesis and the nitrogen from that usually comes from dead bodies at some point along the line. For people that dont understand the finer aspects of biology the only response this statement is likely to get is Youre strange... because in the nonvegans mind there is a distinct conceptual separation from things like roadkill and the chicken sandwich they just got from McDonalds. So this statements intended effect is to link corpses with food in the minds of the subject thereby revealing the nonvegans ultimately unethical and hypocritical behavior with the resultant discomfort targeted at changing their behavior pattern. In essence youre meatshaming and psychologists have stacks and stacks of evidence that shaming provides no long term behavior alteration in the majority of subjects and only socialconforming surface behavior in the short term which is useless for actual behavioral alteration. Sure maybe  out of  people actually have a profound moment of personal change in such circumstances. And if your success rate is that low it is a statistical anomaly not an effective technique.  I really want to see you guys do well you have a great degree empathy for living things and I feel this is a noble pursuit. Just not one that I can ethically justify for myself as the horrible impact of universal veganism on the wellbeing of domesticated animals is too unethical for me to participate in. I will not be a party to the extinction of entire species simply for expedience sake.  ,vegan,d0byrdp,0,t5_2qhpm

6723036,0,t3_47parf,Compassion is what brought me to veganism in the first place  and embracing it has exercised and expanded my capacity for feeling and acting compassionately which is precisely what helps me live in a nonvegan world and still hold great respect for people who have not yet made the changes to their lifestyles which I am grateful to have made for myself.My former ignorance is shameful as is their current ignorance but its not personally shameful to any of us. Most all of us have been raised in cultures where nightmares are normalized to the point of being no more troubling than white noise at night. I had to work to find those nightmares identify them for what they are and accept them as the real consequences of our choices  choices which in modern life seem so distant and benign as to appear absurdly unrelated to the unfathomable suffering they entail. Thats not a simple thing to ask of someone  that they greet with enthusiasm the chance to work hard at a task where success means theyre rewarded with the perspective to witness and let themselves feel affected by horrors that they could easily treat as imaginary without any disruption to their daily lives. And on top of that we ask them to be willing to disrupt their daily lives to try and make a marginal current impact that right now only chips away at the edges of the sprawling mass of horror they now have to accept as real.Just by engaging in the most basic discourse with a nonvegan about the values veganism entails youre expecting a lot from them that theyre willing to honestly share with you their own values so you have some ground to work from that theyre intelligent and curious enough to entertain alternative perspectives seriously and critically that theyre humble enough to see past their own wants and motivations for the sake of values greater than  personal pleasure or expediency and that they have a sincere interest in being a good person or rather one who chooses their actions for the sake of the good.Its because of this that Id really like to see some change in the way people view being confronted about veganism. Often people jump to the conclusion that vegans are trying to tell them theyre bad people and that vegans are simply displaying a lack of respect for them their reasoning their histories and traditions  when from my perspective its the precise opposite. I dont discuss veganism with just anybody because I know its just asking too much for some people at their present moment. That means if I do engage you and share my values and the reasoning that brings me to act upon them then it means I hold you in really high esteem  that I already consider you to be a good intelligent capable sincere and honest person  because otherwise I wouldnt bother sharing with you something so important to me. Im not sayinggtyou do bad things and you should feel bad!Instead what Im trying to say isgtIve discovered something really horrible is going on. Its much much bigger than either of us but it needs to be stopped for goodness sake. I know that its going to be hard really hard  and honestly not everyone is up to the task. But despite the hardship I know its going to entail Im asking you to be my partner in fighting it. Because I believe you have what it takes to win. By this I mean individual endlevel consumers. I hold that a different degree of personal responsibility exists for those who own and control these industries who perpetuate their harms for the sake of profit.,vegan,d0epxr4,3,t5_2qhpm

You actually did decide to go the equate parenting with slavery for the sake of consistency route. However its wrong because guardianship is not ownership and guardians are restricted from harming their wards.gt So what is the justification for controlling them?Youre arguing against us having domesticated animals in the first place. Its not a relevant argument because once again that ship has sailed. Having done it its clear that keeping them as pets is the best thing we can do for them. If you think otherwise please suggest a viable alternative.gtIn case you couldnt tell Im not vegan but if vegans are against the exploitation of animals for human benefitPet ownership is a mutually beneficial relationship that does not have an alternative that isnt terrible for the animals.

All it took was definitely saying that I was never going to eat meat again and suddenly by forcing myself to use fruitsnutsvegetablesgrain I made it work. I discovered that I actually really like vegetables even when they arent drenched in butter or oil oil is okay still. Eventually your tastebuds change after no meat and you stop cooking with oil you start steaming your veggies and baking everything else. Find a dish that you like for me its Thai green curry with vegetablestofu and try doing that until you get tired of it and move on.

Literally judging a book by an ironic title. Dont get me wrong i wont claim that John Joseph is being  ironic with the title. Hes kind of an old school street knucklehead from NY. But the irony in the title is selfevident. One of the biggest enduring ways people dismiss male vegans is to call them pussies. Or some variation. And pussy is obviously in the wider lexicon meaning weakness. In the book  Joseph is basically saying look if you eat meat YOURE the weak one blindly accepting packaged poison from this torture industry. YOURE the one so lacking in supposed masculine discipline that even when faced with facts you hide behind a facade of fake amorality. Hes turning a sexist insult on its head. Its an attention grabbing title for that exact reason.

Her doctors are amazed she is even still alive and she attributes it all to her diet.If we are being fully honest while I do have sympathy for animals I also view it is humans did not reach this point with killing other animals for nutrition to survive. On the other hand now we dont need to rely on animals anymore to survive.Basically my reason for becoming vegan is health benefits but also for the fact of saving animals is just another wonderful addition. One of my barriers is not the fact I would miss meat but I love consuming plain greek yogurt with fruit etc. I enjoy consuming dairy products and I love myself a piece of cake here and there.I really aspire to become vegan and admire anyone who is.  ,vegan,d1mff7u,1,t5_2qhpm

7150009,0,t3_4dg4ta,Greetings fellow childfree vegan! I had to voice my opinion on this post about a month ago. OP asked Why does being made to order matter? So I replied to that imploring OP to adopt dont shop even from a reputable breeder because being made to order does matter.Its the only time Ive ever been downvoted on Reddit. The person who commented back to me wasnt OP but they went ahead and attacked me for Heaven forbid! posting something originally from Petas website. So after defending myself that person not OP saidgtIf you want to argue that its unethical to do anything strictly unnecessary to domesticated animals under our care and we should cease all breeding and let them die out then thats a whole other philosophical issue.In fact I do believe that we should cease all breeding and let them die out. They shouldnt have been bred in the first place. Its my belief that domestication of animals was a mistake. I figured by the way that person was responding to me it would be pointless to debate that topic so I said I didnt want to argue at all I just wanted to encourage someone to adopt not shop.Based on how carnism is so prevalent in society I doubt that people will stop breeding animals in the next  years so there are going to be plenty of animals to adopt in the time being. Also people sometimes dont spay or neuter their pets so there will be um accidents for lack of a better term for a long time coming as well.

And thats hard work.  A lot of times it means staying silent when you want to scream smiling when you want to cry and getting behind the proverbial mule and plowing when you want to sleep in.After decades of participating in and observing political activity I am positive that many societal problems can be solved by fixing ourselves rather than focusing on external forces.How am I a part of the problem?  And if youre in this case a vegan the right answer to this question isnt Im not  I dont eat meat.  Its What am I doing to turn people off to veganism or what am I not doing that could turn people on to it.Merely taking a position by having an opinion isnt enough.  Tee shirts and bumper stickers appeal to people already on your side and alienate those who arent no matter the cause.  Now how to be the sort of person someone wants to emulate I dont know.  I have no charisma whatsoever and bring nothing to the table.  I am grumpy miserable and even somewhat misanthropic. But Ive realized thats a huge part of the problem.  I know what I need to fix but not how to do it.Yet.An interesting thing being a somewhat recent vegan is coming to it from what is probably to the right politically of nearly the whole movement.  I am fully aware of all of the things vegans have said and done over the years which have turned me off.  I see people advocate doing exactly those things on this subreddit and most vegan forums regularly.  In no way is this an excuse for not adopting this diet earlier thats on me.  I have long been aware that annoying people are sometimes right and really nice people are sometimes wrong.  I do not know how many people can make this distinction.All I know is that if I like you  if I see in you something I wished I was or wanted to be  Im going to approach things like a vegan diet from a different angle than lets have a political argument about how rotten you are and how awesome I am.,vegan,d1smdb5,3,t5_2qhpm

Pest control is a real issue and foxes coyotes squirrels and other pests can destroy a livelihood or even kill beloved family members obviously not squirrels.

Unfortunately when I asked if it was dairy freevegan our waitress couldnt answer that question and the owner had just left the restaurant.In my village a new place just opened its kind of a bistro and they have burgers sandwiches salads and such. They have a falafel burger thats huge and delicious but I do have to make sure to order without cheese or garlic sauce and he always puts cheese on it anyway!. Oh they also have a special plate with little vegan bites like cashew cheese and pickles but I havent tried it yet.Anyway I fortunately do have options but I dont like that even the vegetarian meals always have dairy in them.

7240491,0,t1_d216a54,gt Vegetarian comes fro the word vegetus meaning healthy or wholevegetarian n.  irregular formation from vegetable n.  arian as in agrarian etc. The general use of the word appears to have been largely due to the formation of the Vegetarian Society in Ramsgate in  OED. As an adjective from .Youve all read it somewhere The word vegetarian has nothing to do with vegetables it was derived from the Latin vegetus meaning whole fresh lively vigorous etcWhilst all the dictionaries simply suggest the derivation as vegetablearian.Most of us never really believed the vegetus myth but it was impossible to disprove it  until last year.The issue arose because by the late th century the origins of the V word had already been lost even though we now know it was first used by people closely associated with Alcott House near London around  see the footnote for full details of last years research  and the originators did indeed see themselves as just vegetable eaters. In the early th century the word vegetable simply meant any type of plant food including fruits grains etc.. as in animal vegetable or mineral. Over the last  years the meaning has reduced to just certain types of plants.But the the origins of vegetarian had been lost and in his  book The Logic of Vegetarianism Henry Salt wrotegt Noone has  a better right to speak on this matter than Professor J.E.B. Mayor the great Latin scholar and he stated that looking at the word etymologically vegetarian cannot mean an eater of vegetables. It is derived from vegetus vigorous and means strictly interpreted one who aims at vigour. Mind I am not saying that the originators of the term vegetarian had this meaning in view . . .Salts last line I am not saying that the originators of the term vegetarian had this meaning in view shows the opposite of the claims from some that he supported the myth.The first known use in print of vegetarian was in  and for almost the next forty years there is no reference whatsoever in any of the vegetarian journals or books to vegetus. It first appeared in the Vegetarian Messenger  in a translation of an article from Germany  the writer suggested vegetus as the origin but admitted he was merely guessing. Prof. Mayor would have read that and seems to have elaborated on it.Read more ,vegan,d216w1u,1,t5_2qhpm

I had no energy and I had a never ending headache now I bike to work and back  miles each way and have energy to spare. Ive actually had a mayo clinic dietitian tell me the reason low carb diets seem to work at first is because a lot of water weight is attached to carbs so when you first do it you lose a bunch of water weight and it looks like its working great. In reality its all water weight and youre either going to plateau very quickly or any additional weight loss will come from calorie restriction which can be done in a much healthier way than eating things high in cholesterol and fat in small amounts.Weight loss the vegan way is healthier LESS restrictive and you can eat more. One thing youll notice with people who preach the gospel of low carb and fad diets is they stay overweight or if they lose weight it comes back quick. Thanks to veganism I feel better my ethics are inline with the rest of my life I eat way more variety and tasty foods and now Ive gone from being overweight to somebody that is high activity and is gaining muscle.Youre making the right choice and I tip my hat to you the naysayers are preaching to you from a soapbox made of bad arguments and are trying to discourage you because of insecurity.,vegan,d22whog,3,t5_2qhpm

Its all bad in fact it is fucking abhorrent what we do to animals. And think of how many more people we could feed with the land and crops that are used for the sole purpose of feeding livestock. You have to feed your food whereas you could just eat the crop in the first place. More than half the U.S. grain and nearly  percent of world grain is being fed to livestock rather than being consumed directly by humans U.S. agriculture accounts for  percent of all the fresh water consumed each year. Livestock directly use only . percent of that water. But when the water required for forage and grain production is included livestocks water usage rises dramatically.

Do you remember thinking holy crap what would i eat if i was vegan? Unless they agree that veganism is a higher form of ethics they will not bother contriburing. A large group of vegans think a softer approach will be helpful but i disagree. Veganism is mainstream. Stereotypes are like tattoos. Some groups have tried over tipping the waitress to break some money related stereotypes. Some groups preach peace to battle the violent stereotypes yet they linger for decades or centuries. Trying to transform them is like swimming upstream. You cant control it dont think its your responsibility to make veganism look good. Veganism is already amazing. Just engange people if they are attacking veganism or being malicious towards animals for the sake of the audience. They love the drama and to be involved from the sidelines.

Studies back this over and over.Also for optimum absorption reduce or eliminate added salt I can look up the source on this if you like.Actual calcium deficiency in any diet with whole plant foods is completely undocumented no cases. Also calcium supplements have been found to have amounts of lead that are above a level that would allow prudent recommendation FYI Foods fortified with calcium are fortified with the same calcium in supplements.

I feel like that sometimes in regards to all of those things. I try to focus on the love and support my close friends and family provide. Even when we disagree I remember that they let me be who I want and love me for it. Dating is much more difficult. I try to remember that I could easily date someone and tone down who I am but Id rather hold out for someone who loves me for me. None of my friends and family share ALL or even most of those things with me but they accept them even when they fiercely disagree so I am not about to settle for less from a romantic partner. And the things that have been the most difficult tend to ease up with time. When I told my mom I didnt believe in god at the age of  she got extremely sad that I was going to go to hell. Now Im  and while I think she still believes in some vague notion of a higher power she left the church and sees the complete silliness of such a power creating imperfect humans for the sole purpose of judging who is righteous enough to spend eternity with. When I first became vegetarian as a kid everyone I knew basically laughed in my face. Now many of my friends will actually get vegetarian or vegan options if we are together. My brother was often downright horrible to me and hes recently sought out my help to start cutting animal products. After studying biology in college he realized this lifestyle is better for human health the environment and that animals think feel and understand. Try to focus on the love in your life rather than the disconnect. Try to accept that while we can provide information to others we cant force anyone to change. I firmly believe leading by example is the most helpful form of advocacy. I find people are more willing to try things if I bake them vegan cookies or talk about the amazing health benefits Ive noticed rather than telling them what not to do. And its better for us mentally trying to change everyone or focusing on what separates us is draining and beyond frustrating. Never forget all of the good that you are doing. It makes such a difference even if the others around you play it down. Finally look for meetups of likeminded individuals. Were everywhere just easier to spot in some places where we feel safer speaking up and living freely. And dont forget you always have support on this sub. ,vegan,d2l0nsp,49,t5_2qhpm

7524056,0,t1_d2xflfz,Drug references are one thing but you are literally disrespecting thousands of spiritual human beings like myself who take psychedelics as a sacrament. Please do not refer to these sacraments as drugs. It is extremely rude and not at all what you see it to be. An entheogen generating the divine within is a chemical substance used in a religious shamanic or spiritual context that often induces psychological or physiological changes.Entheogens have been used to supplement many diverse practices geared towards achieving transcendence including meditation yoga prayer psychedelic art chanting and multiple forms of music. They have also been historically employed in traditional medicine via psychedelic therapy.You should read about the difference between drugs or chemicals that are synthetically produced are addictive and have extremely harmful physical and mental side effects and entheogenswhich are substances like amanita muscaria lophophora williamsii and ipomoea tricolor that occur beneath dead trees in the deserts along paths in county forests. These entheogenic substances have been used by the human race for thousands of years to attain various things and they have been more useful than any antidepressant medication prescribed by a western medicine doctor in my entire lifespan. The conspiracy youre failing to recognize here is the government has taken control of these sacraments labelling them drugs and using them to perform crude awful experimentsNOT JUST ON OUR MILITARY BUT ON ANIMALS THE SAME. And for what purpose? For the purpose of mind control in order to create the largest brainwashed company in history. Please if you feel the need to call this a conspiracy do not take the side of our government who has no interest in free thought but free thought control aloneAs a strict ethical vegan and somebody who promotes psychedelic therapy through natures bountyI do not want my sacrament affiliated with epidemics like crack cocaine and heroin usage.,vegan,d2xg4zq,3,t5_2qhpm

7556123,0,t3_4itxnj,I just dont think this is a good video. Not because I am someone who is upset Murphy has left the herd. But because I think her arguments are weak. She says she first got into veganism for weight loss. And that she was battling an ED. This somewhat mimics my own journey into veganism. She now says she has read all the books on nutrition but is now jumping onto The PaleoTM Diet?I feel that in reality her arguments really boil down to  My options were limited on a vegan diet It was more difficult to go out to eat on a vegan diet It is possible to be an ethical eater but not veganI feel a lot of the ethical stuff she mentioned was only there to cloud that veganism just wasnt convenient for her. I love that her video is titled Why I No Longer Eat A Vegan Diet instead of Why I Am No Longer Vegan  as I think that sums it up. The same way that you see a lot of new articles  blog posts talking about exveganism when what they really mean is explantbaseddiet. There also seems to be a clear contradiction in her talking about ethical omnivorism  beside the obvious one. Trying to be as ethical as possible would mean reducing your intake of animal products as much as possible. She then goes on to have tuna with her lunch and then salmon and cheese with her dinner. That doesnt exactly look like a reduceatarian to me. Its also for this reason that I find the post title no longer eats strictly vegan frustrating. How could you be vegan whilst occasionally eating animal products? Her logic on reducing intake is also flawed. Obviously I am very glad to hear about people who reduce their intake of meat by  after following Meatless Mondays. But I think it is a dangerous state of mind for those people to rest on their laurels and suggest that all others need to do is reduce down to their levels. Reduction is not a valid course of action in debates on moral extremes. No one would be satisfied to hear someone proud of themselves for hitting people  less than usual. If you are claiming that you have the interests of animals at heart  as Murphy claims  I dont see why you would be eating two portions of fish per day. I think reduction would make more sense if the sole reason for it was environmentalism  the reason I originally was interested in veganism. But that would not make it the same sort of ethical choice that Murphy puts across.Being slightly less unethical does not make you ethical.,vegan,d313fcz,11,t5_2qhpm

But usually people back off quickly when they realize how we actually all went on with stuff from the nazis dealing with life with an industrial mindset so its touchy and not a good way to reach out to people who dont think about how we treat other human beings and animals.That was the whole point of the ideology you insist how the outsider is evil and both powerful and weak to pump up everyone whos an insider. You tighten your community by underlining how foreign the others are as that superficially levels down all the internal diversity and unrest as you know your real enemy. Racism .Speciesism works the same way of course but it looks like only the objectification part is talked about here. The benefits of killing animals are not compared to the goals of genocides by killing the others the killers want to clean themselves from a deficient humanity to remove the cause of all their troubles conspirators to show their strength and will to tighten up and strengthen their group by eliminating the bad elements.My point is that theres a lot more in killing even by proxy and eating flesh than just culture protein and taste. Its all about getting the strength of a live being asserting our power over Nature temporarily because Nature is harsh the rest of the time showing wealth as meat has always been a sign of that.With that in mind in a clearer comparison we perfected the way we can remove ourselves from the killing and the meaning of that killing through diminishing their value.That existed before of course but the industrial processes and mentality is modern.

No wonder you are having manic episodes and wanting to eat fatty animal products. If you start putting your health first you will get over this. Start by eating at least  calories a day everyday. If you starve your body of necessary nutrients then you will not be able to function optimally. Start eating a high carb low fat diet and eat in abundance. Also drink enough water each day get enough rest live an active lifestyle and keep an attitude of gratitude. Its in your power to do these simple things. If you implement them you will stick with veganism and you will feel healthy and happy each day. Your literally starving yourself so of course your going to feel crazy and dive for the calorie rich animal products. Its just your body telling you it needs food.

They normally are roaming around several open acres that are enclosed. She has those wolves and a lot of other animals you probably see in a lot of movies. She has a few huge bears she has tigers lions lots of birds birds of prey hawks owls horses mules many foxes raccoons kinkajous binturongs and a lot of these animals are just her rescues as well. She does have a tiger that is completely blind that was rescued and she did let me pet her through the bars of her large enclosure but only for a second because the tiger was rubbing up on them indicating it was alright and she wanted attention at that particular second.She did also let me pet one of her very old somewhat blind and very deaf raccoons but only for a second as well. I completely understood that the animals didnt know me and as much as she does train them for movies and shows they really arent meant to be socialized with in the way I would like to you know pets and cuddles.So I did get to walk up near the wolvesdogs eating but I didnt get to actually meet any for this reason. Theyre still wolves wolf hybrids. But you can bet I wanted to give them pets! She did let me feed the foxes though because all I had to do was slide their food dishes under a divider. One of the bears she had also refuses to eat meat. For weeks they tried to get him to eat meat and no matter how they disguised it he wouldnt. He only eats plants so he has a special diet.

Just thought Id throw in my two cents because this post seems to be attracting lots of calories in v calories out tho comments. Which is true to an extent but its not that simple or easy.

7757566,0,t1_d3nxxi1,It depends on your definition of small. There are places that absolutely have too small of enclosures Im talking where the animals barely have room to move around. Those are overwhelmingly inappropriate. Other zoos Ive visited to have smaller spaces but are in the process of renovating. This is especially true of older zoos who may have leftover exhibits from back when nobody really understood animal needs. I think that the legal requirements in the U.S. at least arent enough because they can permit some pretty sad looking exhibits. However the AZA Association of Zoos and Aquariums has much higher standards for space and exhibit design that zoos must meet to be able to be accredited. I think those are beneficial in making sure that animals are housed appropriately. I think an idea exhibit should be large enough to permit natural movements like the animal can run if it wants to run etc and should offer at least one space where they can move out of the view of the public. Just because an animal has a large home range doesnt mean they cant be cared for in a smaller area. You have to always keep in mind that an animal that maybe travels miles a day isnt doing it because it wants to but because it has to. If it was able to meet its needs food water shelter sometimes mates in a smaller area you wouldnt see it moving across such great distances. As far as entertainment for the animals goes enrichment and training should be a part of every animals care. And all animals should be housed with others unless they are a solitary species or have some sort of medical requirement that prevents them from being with others.As far as the story with the lions its such a sad situation all around. Mental health is a difficult topic to navigate. This would have all been prevented if the man had been able to get help before attempting to take his life. Its a tragedy that the lions had to be shot. However most zoos have to put the priority on saving human life no matter how heartbreaking it is for staff. I was initially very angry about this because the lions were doing nothing wrong. But especially when mental illness is involved it is really difficult. I know that if this had been one of my own family members I would want to take the measures needed to save them. ,vegan,d3nz5iz,5,t5_2qhpm

7772503,0,t1_d3pnvoz,Take a breath and read what you are writing. You dont believe what you are saying. gt but there are many people that dont pump there meat full of horomones dont let their animals reside if filth feed them proper diets rather than food to fatten them up etc. Ok but their core business model is always killing baby animals for no good reason. Thats never ok with the animal who would form relationshops enjoy playing enjoy eating enjoy the sun if given the choice. Taking that life from the animal would be wrong enough  but when you look deeper the idea that there are farms treating their animals well turns out to be false. This was an investigation of one of Whole Foods only  star welfare rated farms. And this is obvious  you wouldnt let someone watch your dog who kills dogs to eat.gt what many people forget is that plants are just as much living things as animals so to me the morality is pretty much the same for vegans as for omnivores or carnivores.This is where I know that you are being dishonest with yourself. You dont think plants feel joy or pain or have families. You just do not believe that you can type full sentences. I know you would not mow your lawn and mow right over a bird as well because its the same thing. You are not fooling me I have to believe you arent fooling yourself with this either.Animals feel joy and fear and love. Plants do not. The fact that you are pretending to be confused about this means that you have turned your brain off to avoid thinking about what being food means to an animal who wants to live his life.

Here are some of my concerns for this projectFirst I truly wish them the best and hope it succeeds but I get the impression that this is a business that the founder wishes existed rather than one the community wantsneeds.  Second in largermore progressive communities bicycle food carts can be a tough sell for customers and Im assuming more so in this case being that it is an area without vegan options.   Ive been living in larger cities for a while but visit family in rural areas and have noticed that big cities can be snobby regarding carts and small towns still have a bias against them.Lastly as you are well aware being someone highly successful in the restaurant industry theres a lot of underlying factors to start such a business and I am skeptical of any food business started by someone seemingly inexperienced in food service industry.  The founder hasnt been vegan for very long let alone demonstrated that they have the foodbusiness knowledge to pull this off.  While I know this is about as small scale an operation one can start Im a bit jadedburnt out on individuals particularly in the vegan world who open a business that they had no business opening only to close within a month or two.,vegan,d3utuy2,2,t5_2qhpm

7837987,0,t1_d3wz0no,I think you brought up an important point though veganism wasis viewed as a white person thing. About a year after I went vegan a friend made an off hand comment about how being vegan was so white were both white which seemed really weird to me at the time because when I went vegan ate a lot of Indian Ethiopian middle eastern recipes because they were the ones that had good meals based around legumes that and I had just finished reading Bryant Terrys book so veganism didnt look white to me at the time.I think anything that lowers the barrier to more people becoming vegan is a great thing so people becoming more aware of health and environmental aspects is great as are blog and cookbook writers like Bryant Terry and Richa Hingle showing that there are rich food cultures to be had with vegan cuisine. And of course white vegans I think need to consider their words and their message so that they arent making it a white thing and arent being dicks about their messaging. ,vegan,d3x22nh,3,t5_2qhpm

7842375,0,t3_4mmgrw,Hi all!Im a relative newbie to all this and a complete newbie to this sub or posting on reddit at all for that matter. I started transitioning to veganism about  days ago switched to all vegan lunches and have only been fully vegan for  days now. Im in my late s probably about  pounds overweight amp been an omnivore all my life. Something just clicked with me one day  it was a story about some dogs being freed from a meat processor overseas someplace. I thought it would be hilarious if someone came over here to liberate our cows. Then I started to think about it more seriously and the distinction between animals we eat amp ones we dont started feeling a bit arbitrary which led me to considering my life choices and voila. I also blame my cats who I love to pieces I should note that I havent even begun to truly grapple with the ethics of owning pets at all or that buying pet food means Im still contributing to animal cruelty.Only a couple of people know but its more because my diet has never really been a topic of conversation in my social circles before so why would it suddenly be now? The two that do know my spouse an omnivore and our friend a vegan have been very encouraging and pretty awesome overall.I dont have any great recipes yet but I am looking forward to trying lots of different things on my grills! The best thing Ive done so far was learn to recreate Chipotles rice beans amp veggies at home so I stop spending so much money at Chipotle .Most of my clothing was already nonanimal so that hasnt been an issue. I did replace my soap with something new. Still on the lookout for good dandruff shampoo and a decent nonbadger hair shaving brush. Cats are obligate carnivores so I am not considering replacing their food with nonmeat food which probably makes me not a vegan at all amp I should just shut up and go away now sorry.Things Ive learned almond milk is delicious but almond milk yogurt is not Trader Joes has a ton of awesome vegan snacks salad is more than just an excuse to load up on croutons amp bacon bits. And that its not too late in my life to make a change that just feels good all around.Looking forward to reading this sub amp learning from you all!,vegan,d3xjusr,4,t5_2qhpm

My SIL and her partner visited and the only awkwardness was when he got weird and asked me why I forced my diet on my son. He backed off though when I explained my position and asked him to talk to my son.. All of Miyokos vegan pantry has been amazing. I made a ton of seitan and a bunch of veganized dairy products and basically sub them into my normal recipes. Its made my transition way easy. Condiments also make a big difference. Some Daiya or Miyokos cheese some just mayo.... I get a ton of but what about people exploited picking vegetablesveggie agriculture kills too tho comments. I just tend to debate by asking questions. How much do you think a cow eats in a day more than a human? If cows eat that much more than humans than how do we support the cows? Sometimes after this they switch to chickens but they tend to back down if at that point I just point out the various facts of how animal agriculture is wasteful. The other one I got was from my dad where he argued if cows could treat humans like we do them because they could and wanted to eat us they would. I eventually convinced him to read Eternal Treblinka and have gotten some texts from him. Mostly ones musing on morality and not antagonistic but self questioning. But to be fair my dad always encouraged us to be free thinking.. This sub has been great. The only non supportive stuff I see is when people are like DUMP YOUR OMNI PARTNERS how could you tolerate that?! And its like well I was Omni too and no Im not throwing away over a decade of relationship and the stability of my kids family home because my partner is not immediately and  percent on board with this admittedly uphill and culturally ingrained battle. Beyond that Pinterest and various vegan apps have been so helpful.. Yeah with regards to dairy. I ate cheese pizza and pretty shortly after felt completely disgusted with myself knowing what I do about the dairy industry and ended up looking through my kids baby album and crying . The insane thing is I use to not be like that all super emotional. . I have a vintage fur I donated to animal rehab. I have leather purses and Im still debating to sell or not trying to decide how best to handle the ethics. For now Im using my one faux croc Rebecca Minkoff bags. I kind of really just want a nice black vegan leather bag and a red vegan bag. . Ive always felt strongly towards human issues. Id say becoming vegan has just opened me up more on a personal level. I used to feel a step removed but it all feels so much more personal now. I dont know how comfortable I am but Im not a cool vegan. I dont preach to anyone but I dont lie about how I feel..

There are people who are sensitive to soy though just like gluten or nightshades.

Ive always supplemented and get bloodwork done every  years or so and my levels have always been fine.There is no known toxic or harmful dose of B so even if you take a  RDA pill every day youll be fine youll just pee the excess out.

There are a lot of procedures in place to make sure that cross contamination doesnt happen If you are very allergic which it sounds like you are tell the person taking your order. Have them go back into the kitchen and tell the people making it that you are extremely allergic because they will. One of the things that is so great about Amys is that pretty much anyone can eat there. Pretty much all of our customers are people who have some sort of dietary restrictions and thats why they might come to Amys. As I said before If you really want to know what you can and cant eat there it would be best to go in and see or you could email them and they will get back to you or for immediate answers you could always call the restaurant and they will get out that book for you and tell you everything that you can and cant eat.

7889066,0,t3_4ncgw4,. I definitely dont think you need to come out as vegan. In fact generally speaking you dont even have to use the word vegan if you dont want to. If you find yourself in a situation where someone asks you why you dont eat animal products  byproducts then youll have the opportunity to tell them if youd like. . There are so many vegan alternatives packed full of everything a person needs especially nowadays. Youll have no trouble finding all kinds of products which I bet your husband will love once he gives them a chance. The notion that veganism  nutritional deficiency simply isnt true its just a question of eating properly which applies to vegans and nonvegans alike.. In my experience the best way to overcome the desire for the things that are hard to give up is to think about it from the perspective of the animal that it came from. When you look at it through their eyes you realize its not really food youre giving up but suffering that you arent causing them. Its something to feel good about.I think its wonderful youre considering making the transition to a vegan lifestyle and that itll all turn out well .,vegan,d42sycz,5,t5_2qhpm

I know animals dont have rights in most countries I also know that  humans and their more retarded rituals are considered important enough to end the life of innocent animals.But Im not stupid enough to not recognize the problems in such situations. Some races used to have more rights than others people would punish the worthless slaves because... well... they obviously worth less than the thing they accidentally broke. They would do the same everywhere.Justifying your actions with fallacies like that is really bad and please dont say but everyone does that because it just makes it worse.But lets talk about the human that died for a second whose dead body you said was more important than alive animals which is something he used to be.Why is it important at all to bury someones body? Why would that be more important than sentient living beings? What if it was a human that thing between the ritual and the parents?And why would they consider the alligators to be denying such rights? Its like police getting into peoples houses because someone in the city or even neighborhood stole something or kidnapped someone. You can argue that the right of liberty is more important than the right to not be intervened by police but you cannot argue that the police in my example were on the right.So the whole system that you understand in your head isnt more than the result of fallacies  regressiveness of your culture and its swarm mentality.  ,vegan,d4cds9r,1,t5_2qhpm

Please dont get me started on the obnoxiousness and the complete cultural insensitivity. In my community traditionally its less about the food and more about the company. There is a saying in my language that goes the rarest seasoning for a bowl of rice is someone to share it with. Its about eating with someone and not about what youre eating.

7983654,0,t1_d4d6f22,Part You are still dancing and making rationalizations. Maybe you dont have rigteous indignation for trophy hunting but so what. Im asking you what specific problem you have with it and none of your reasoning really holds up. Of course its less important than other things. You say someone hunts for sport AND eats and then you have no problem with it. I dont get why you would take time to write this as youve already made your point clear unless your contrasting it to the person who doesnt eat it which means you have a problem with it.You didnt accept my point that if wasting meat was your only issue then you should feel that someone who buys to much food at a buffet is just as bad as a trophy hunter. Do you agree that this is the case?You give several reasons why trophy hunting is good conservation the fact that the corpse is not wasted anyway you mentioned vultures but I will note that literally every part of that animal is used and cycled through the environment providingfood for scavengers worms parasites and eventually plants. Not a single bit of that body was wasted. Why do you say its wasted when a human killed it for pleasure and let the nutrients cycle ibut its not wasted in other cases? I presented you the example of an obese person hunting deer. Wouldnt it be more wasteful in that case for him to put those calories and protein into his own body to be turned into poop and fat when his body will eventually be cremated or buried? Isnt it less wasteful for that person to leave the deers body in nature to feed the jackals vultures coyotes worms and so on?I see no reasonable way that you could consider eating the body of a deer you dont need to be less wasteful than leaving the body for animals who need it.You bring up the violent death that an animal experiences in nature. Again doesnt this just argue for the acceptability of trophy hunting? If someone didnt hunt for a trophy that animal would die of starvation disease or predation so didnt they peform a moral service the same as if theyd hunted for food?gtAn animal lost its life which should have gravitas over...So youve substituted respect for gravitas. I dont get what gravitas has to do with it. You should have gravitas when you kill or you hvae a problem with it? So do you find a moral difference between someone who kills a deer while laughing and drinking beer then poses the body so it looks like its humping something and then eats it vs a person who kills a deer solemnly and quietly kneels in front of it thanks nature and the heavens for giving him the talent to vanquish his opponent then eats it? And how does gravitas compare to waste? Since gravitas could be equally present or absent for a trophy hunter or a food hunter Im not sure how you can argue that it distinguishes between the two cases.Now you mentioned gravitas specifically over letting the vultures have it. Is the issue here that you find vultures to eat in a disrespectful way? The gross way they dig into a corpse does not have the appropriate gravitas?Can you explain why gravitas is important? It sounds like some sort of metaphysical claim like the spirit of the animal is going to be insulted by how you treat its corpse.Im asking you a direct question please answer Do you find a trophy hunters actions morally comparable to the actions of a person who habitually takes  more salad than they need at a salad bar and then throws a lot of it away? Why or why not?If you want to make it about meat then how about someone who habitually fails to finish the entire chicken leg that is put on their plate?gtYour example is basically We dont eat dead people to show respect we shouldnt eat dead animals to do the same. This is a total logical inconsistency. You cannot imply that humans whether in death or life are equivalent to other animals while basing your entire morality on the fact that humans are different from other animals and we shouldnt act like they do in the wild eating other animals.First I dont base my entire morality on the fact that animals are different from humans. I base my morality on values that I hold. Any animal who has the same values that I have should act in the same way. Second calling me a hypocrite even if it were true wouldnt have any bearing on my argument. Suppose that I am inconsistent in saying whether animals should orshould not have the same values as humans how would that matter to the point at hand? Third I am not arguing that animals are equivalent to humans. I am arguing that there is absolutely no basis for your claim that eating a dead body shows respect to the being you killed to get that food. Eating humans is not a particularly highrisk activity if you choose the appropriate organs and prepare them safely. Of course you can point to horrible diseases you can get from cannibalism but I can say the same about deer. Ive seen vegans post studies on disease you get from deer and horror stories of people who have worms encysted in their body etc. These can happen but theyre low likelihood. Youre exagerrating the danger. Theres a reason nearly every culture has widespread acceptance of life after death and its not because theres a good biological reason. A lot of human behavior surrounding life and death is not rational and there is no basis for just assuming that it is.But in any case if eating a body was a sign of respect I dont see any reason why no human culture has developed rituals around consuming their dead friends. Why not at least symbolically consume them to show how much you respected their life?This idea that its respectful to eat a corpse whether its a human or animal is without basis as far as I can tell. Can you clarify why its respectful to shove a deers ground up organs into your mouth?Regarding the pet dog you say Im not following your reasoning. I say that I am following your reasoning and that your reasoning lacks merit. You say humans have foresight. So what? If there is no moral harm in killing the animal why should they apply foresight? Humans have foresight to know theyre going to kill a cow and eat it. The humans knew the child would enjoy the puppy they have the foresight to know that the puppy will grow into an adult that they wont enjoy as much as a puppy and they make a sound logical decision.You repeatedly say it demonstrates psychopathy but a youre just frankly wrong I doubt any psychologist would diagnose a wealthy family as psychopathic because they choose to euthanize a pet in order to have a puppy around next year and b its circular reasoning. Its wrong because its psychopathic and its psychopathic because its wrong.Yes they knew the possible inconvenience. They also knew how to avoid it. So what?How can you argue that their actions werent consistent with their needs? Their children like puppies. Their life is enriched by puppies. If the death is inherently without moral calm why are you demanding more reason than the enrichment of their life? How is this not an honest reason? Bacon yum is an honest reason but my children enjoy puppies is dishonest? gtI require no reason for an animals death. I merely ask a human provide some honest reason for taking a life See the problem? You are employing doublespeak and piling on bad rationalizations to support it. You dont need a reason for a dogs death but someone who kills a dog is a psychopath who didnt have an honest reason for it. And by the way you earlier made the accusation that my entire worldview is based on humans being different from animals and have repeatedly criticized my argument by noting that I am acting in a way that no wild animal would act. So where do you find the space to saygtI dont hold animals to the same moral standards as humans and neither do you. In the same manner I dont hold animal life in the same regard as I do human life and neither do you. Would you hold a shark personally responsible for killing a human in the water? Would you have the authorities find it bring it in and execute it with lethal injection for murder?Why the silly questions? Did something I say make you wonder if I want to charge sharks with murder?And since you insist that dogs are family and that you act in ways morally consistent with this claim and would take on tens of thousands of dollars to treat your pet and you say all of this in support of your claim that the reason it is immoral to kill a dog is that he is family... do you see where this leads us? Most people do not have such regard for pets. Most people will euthanize a pet rather than spend  on its recovery. I work plenty of emergency shifts in addition to my clinical practice work and I can tell you that the people willing to spend more than  on a hitbycar dog even when the prognosis is good is tiny.So how does your reasoning fit with this? I see how it would be wrong for you to kill your dog. But your argument is that the morality or immorality of killing a dog has literally nothing to do with rights inherent to the dog intrinsic value of animal life etc but that any  moral wrong comes from human perceptions and emotions of their relationship to that animal. So onsidering most people clearly do not define dogs as family and do not act in a way that would demonstrate that wouldnt you have to admit that in most cases killing a dog for a trivial reason would be okay? And specifically you have argued that the actions of the people in my scenario are psychopaths for mistreating family but why dont you conclude instead that they dont regard the dog as family? They obviously dont.,vegan,d4dfs7z,1,t5_2qhpm

7990027,0,t1_d4e45cx,gt Is it bad to shoot at people in GTA or CounterStike? Are the people doing so actually all murderers? No because who cares this is a videogame nobody is suffering from this action.I get your point but one might defend OP a bit still. For example we wouldnt find it OK if a game portrayed killing jews as a fun and good thing. I would say we basically never get straightforwardly positive or even neutral portrayals of killing minorities or good people generally. We only get it ironically as in GTA or we get the killing of supposedly evil people like in CounterStrike.Now killing animals is very often protrayed as something wholly unproblematic and I can understand why that would irk somebody. For example the Skyrim statistics dont count it as a murder if you kill the cows and dogs of a village. By contrast IIRC its impossible to even attack the children who run about by the way. Thats how wrong we find killing children its not even an option in the game. So theres actually a great deal of moral stances implicit in the way these games are structured and I find it perfectly OK for OP to criticize those stances.,vegan,d4e5lpv,1,t5_2qhpm
7990784,0,t3_4oo9jw,My opinion on thisI do not appreciate people being vegan for attention but the thing is im vegan for multiple reasons including ethics and meat industries massive contribution to global warming. So whenever somebody makes a step however small towards helping to make the situation better then thats a success. Because thats the ultimate thing that i as a vegan care for.I truly believe pursuing  veganism is counterproductive. if you are one good. But if not then every little bit you do helps the planet and other beings. Screw the people that give you shit when you arent a perfect vegan.Traffic safety is a thing to fight for as well. But show me a person who doesnt occasionally speed park over the lines or does not come to a complete stop at a stop sign. its fine because you are generally and most of the time still contributing to the safety of traffic by being considerate.i see this whole issue the same way. we are not perfect. and thats okay. i dont like the labelling vegan. not vegan but i cant help it. but if you already eat less meat than you did before. thats good. if you drop dairy or decide not to buy leather shoes because superior textiles have been around for a long time now thats good as well. lets celebrate the small steps and encourage to maybe take larger ones rather than being dismissive and calling somebody a faker. that does not help anyone.,vegan,d4e8nql,53,t5_2qhpm

8042104,0,t3_4pc7k3,I like this quote being intellectually honest is being able to acknowledge arguments that might contradict our behavior belief or identity systems. Its something Ive lately been striving for. Ive not been doing much but Ive been talking to small family farmers dairy mainly on instagram about their thoughts and practices.However that study concluding that buying beef from Brazil helps reduce insect suffering is .... quite well it compares it to soybeans and palm oils effect on wildlife insect suffering which is not saying anything for it as a standalone. So the premise seemed to be that slash and burn occurs but that with cattle they can graze on that deforested land for many years. But thats not true either. It also basically neglects to mention that many of those acres of soybeans are for cattle feed in other countries. Also many vegans simply avoid palm oil altogether including myself.  It just seems really backwards. Im really glad to read that you werent taking it to heart because I actually think its a really bad argument against veganism. Heres why Mainly because intentionally supporting suffering even if its of fewer individuals is morally worse than accidentally contributing. Also its assuming that if the land WILL be deforested anyway so why not raise cattle? If thats the case which it very well may be then its really sad because this fight has been going on since the s when it hit its first peak in people around the world caring. Edited out a part of my response about clearcutting because at first I didnt understand the point of the argument. I have to also be honest I am never going to think drinking milk is ok simply because it was made for a baby and now that Ive  learned all about it I could NEVER support that EVER again in my life. Its so vile and horrible. I do however like the idea of advocating for people to give up what they feel they can at a point in time. For example if someone says Id love to go vegan but I cant give up my cheese Id like to challenge them to give up every other animal product but cheese. Usually that isnt the only reason but hey. With all that said I think its really cool that you wrote this I am glad you shared.

Im glad that people who want to go vegan for health reasons are recognising that just going vegan itself is a not a magic bullet for that particular end. Personally I never bother mentioning anything about health when asked about my veganism because although there might be a few health bonuses in it for me in the long run its not why Im vegan. Also caring about health doesnt make someone orthorexic. Like I say Ive only really seen eating clean applied to diets based on whole foods where the emphasis seems to be on preparing simple balanced meals more or less from scratch without degraded or heavily processed ingredients. But you say theres a lot more variation from those who tout the phrase so I guess thats just the bias of my narrow experience showing. I possibly zone out a lot of the half baked ideas people try to attach to everything they do too. People are flaky and dont like to have rigorous opinions Im so used to that it just washes over me.

I had been mostly vegan and on my way to eating completely vegan for a few months had been vegetarian for years and I was having a conversation with my boyfriends brother who disagrees with eatingliving a vegan lifestyle. His example was a cow who needed to be milkedisnt it more humane to milk the cow who needs to be milked anyway? And for some reason I was stumped. I said something like well yeah but we raised those cows so if we hadnt done that they wouldnt need to be milked in the first place. Then later that night it hit me...wait...humans dont need to be constantly milked...women only produce milk when theyve just had a baby. I looked it up and felt so stupid for never having thought of this before. Of course they dont just constantly make milk. They make breast milk for their babies! If only I had realized this when I was still talking to him...Another one I had was when I was sitting in someones brand new car with leather seats. At first I thought wow this is so nice!!

Add what spices you like.Pay attention to getting these nutrients Vitamin B  Must supplement. Plants dont contain B Dosage What I take Protein  Eat more. Lysine is the limiting amino acid. Best source legumes beans lentils chickpeas peas soy. Get at least  of calories from protein or ..g per kg of body weight if you are sedentary ..gkg if you are physically active. Vitamin D  Better supplement. Dosage Take with fatty meals to increase absorption. Vitamin D is always vegan vitamin D is vegan when labelled look for Vitashine D. What I take Iodine  Supplement or eat more. Sources seaweed iodized salt. Dosage Iron  Eat more do blood tests regularly supplement when low. Pair foods rich in iron with foods rich in vitamin C and carotenoids to boost absorption. Coffee tea and cacao decrease iron absorption. Check blood hemoglobin and ferritin levels. Calcium  Eat more.

If you need more calories for maintaining or gaining weight focus on calorically dense foods such as nuts seeds dried fruits whole grains legumes and starchy vegetables. Make smoothies and nut butters liquids and blends are easier to consume. To lower your calorical intake focus on fiber and waterrich foods such as nonstarchy vegetables. Soak grains and legumes overnight before cooking it decreases phytic acid and indigestible sugars that cause gas improves mineral availability. Add baking soda use a pressure cooker for a stronger effect. If you are still uncomfortable with the amount of gas you experience try enzymes such as Beanzyme.,vegan,d4xbira,0,t5_2qhpm

I dont eat honey because its possible that bees might suffer and I would rather be safe and I dont buy the argument that modern beekeeping is good for bee populations but I really dont care if people eat honey or even oysters for that matter.

My SO used to buy them for himself before we decided to make our household vegan. The chickens are fed veggie scraps from the garden and have a very large outdoor area to roam and dig for worms. However there are still plenty of other problems associated with this type of egg production. Even the smallhumane farms participate in unsavory practices like buying their female chicks from hatcheries that kill the males since they are an unwanted byproduct. Furthermore these farms will not typically keep a hen past her useful years they will most likely kill and replace her once productivity drops at a fraction of her natural lifespan.,vegan,d5gv57l,2,t5_2qhpm

Ethically they are different because one is preventing suffering and the other is ending the life of a young animal. But in terms of what the animal experiences it is equal.Similarly a bullet to the head that kills instantly is humane. Ethically it can be questioned whether that death was necessary and we can argue all day over that. But in terms of what the animal felt it can be considered humane because it didnt suffer. ,vegan,d5hx4z6,7,t5_2qhpm

8349241,0,t1_d5l44im,I think thats a bit of a simplistic take on veganism. Vegans by definition seek to minimize exploitation and cruelty to animals but that doesnt necessarily translate into no use of animals for any human purposes. It would not be unvegan if its not exploiting or cruel to the animal.I think what ubulborb was getting at is that dogs have been domesticated so that they rely on humans for care and bred so that they are happy to be and work with humans. You may well question the morality of domesticating them this way but thats largely already been done we cant change the past. The question in front of us is whether is it unethical to use them in this capacity. The issue of breeding aside I tend to see the benefits of using dogs as service animals and search and rescue etc. far outweigh any harm caused. The dogs help alleviate others suffering and I think the relationship is more mutually beneficial. When trained positively the dogs enjoy working they enjoy being with people and they enjoy the mental stimulation that comes with service work. ,vegan,d5l7ibg,3,t5_2qhpm
8349306,0,t1_d5kqput,gtHowever there is no way that a human being could reach their B requirements by eating soiled food unless that soil contained a lot of very freshly manure.Not true really.  Its believed we need very little B and the amount necessary is not well defined.  In fact the UK keeps decreasing its recommended amount.  A whole lifetimes requirement of B add up to a  milligram speck of red crystals.  In addition its not just livestock that make their own vitamin B is excreted in human bile and is effectively reabsorbed. This is known as enterohepatic circulation. The amount of B excreted in the bile can vary from  to ug micrograms a day. People on diets low in B including vegans and some vegetarians may be obtaining more B from reabsorption than from dietary sources. Reabsorption is the reason it can take over  years for a deficiency disease to develop.  In comparison if B deficiency is due to a failure in absorption it can take only three years for a deficiency disease to occur.Most reported problems of B deficiency are related to malabsorption not diet.  ,vegan,d5l7su5,1,t5_2qhpm

Definitely cut out cheese milk and eggs though. Theyre not doing your health any good!What was it that made your previous meals enjoyable? Probably not plain ole meat! Few people like munching on chicken breast or beef without any salt or seasoning added. Its the seasoning and the way its cooked that makes meat tasty. So try looking at vegan meals in the same way. If you dont already have a variety of spices and seasonings go get some! Lots of people seem to like sriracha so you could utilize that if you arent already.Curry is easy and delicious and will last you a while if you make a big batch of it. I really like butter chicken without the butter and the chicken...ha and aloo gobi. Stir fries are good and by adding different veggies and seasonings you can make them taste very different each time. You can have them with rice or cellophane noodles or shirataki noodles...You can make veggie wraps with tortillas or rice paper. Cornbean salad is easy and doesnt require cooking good for summer heat!. Chips with salsa and guac is a good snack. You can really make just about everything...just replace all of the animal products with healthier vegan alternatives. Replace chicken with tofu...milk with soy or almond milk...butter with vegan butter or vegetable oil...etc. Check out veggietorials edgyveg and hotforfood on youtube.

It seems you are developing balanced meals that should cover all of the nutrients a person would need why do you feel like you need a multivitamin?  heres a link with some sources.  can google for mor nonmcdougall if you like but i find his analysis helpful.    i have not really found a compelling reason to take multivitamins and a few reasons to not take them.,vegan,d5w5rx2,1,t5_2qhpm

Often if you just tell places they will actually be more than happy to help and very often come back to you for feedback in case they get another vegan.

Nuke a flour tortilla for  seconds.  . Nuke a can of vegan refried beans maybe do this before step .  . Spread the beans on the flour tortilla and then slap on the crunchy corn taco shell.  . cut off excess flour tortilla if you didnt really get the sizing right at the store.  . Add the beefless crumbles be generous.  . Add a layer of cheeze shreds be generous.  . Iceberg lettuce. Tomatoes. Sour Cream.

Learning to read ingredients lists quickly will really help!  You can find lists of ingredients to watch out for all over the internet I have one on my site but they really are everywhere!My biggest struggle was cheese.  Daiya saved me.  And now vegan cheeses are SO MUCH BETTER!  Youre going vegan at an amazing time   Try out Miyoko and Chow!Dont be too hard on yourself.  Give yourself time to learn about the vast aspects of veganism as a diet and complete lifestyle.  You will probably eat something nonvegan by mistake or buy something with animal products.

I dont think Ill convince you of anything and you are not really teaching me anything new here. This study is biased and has evident shortcomings it shouldnt be good enough for anyone.

Scientists have worked on labgrown organs for decades there are many limitations including short lifespans high cost and low scalability. Its not nearly as easy as it may seem. Labgrown organs are currently not feasible. On the contrary growing the organs inside animals is extremely feasible and efficient.If human survival and wellbeing requires that we harm animals so be it. If it does not that harming should be considered unnecessary and sadistic.To say otherwise would literally be to condemn human life.I like to have a hierarchy of values with issues like this arranged like this. Humans. AnimalsEnvironmentThis hierarchy allows for human progress while also justifying veganism and alternative food sources.Labgrown organs will become a reality in the foreseeable future and that will be glorious but until then we need a good solution.

Most people never even question their habits and dont fully realize what theyre participating in with animal agriculture. Often it wont make a difference but even just a small amount of influence builds up over time.Third often times movements that get a certain threshold point of participants where it starts to have a snowball effect. If eating animal products is no longer completely normal and more vegans and vegan alternative food choices exist it will be more socially acceptable and comfortable for the average person.,vegan,d6hxmwt,2,t5_2qhpm

8629365,0,t1_d6k6cbo,OK Ill scrounge up the sources if I can... I researched this area extensively a few years ago its incredibly interesting. Unfortunately I either didnt take notes or cant find them and the papers I used I believe are on an older computer. Maybe I can locate them...You seem to be doing research in this area so Ill give you a summary of what Ive learned relating to it. I also made a youtube video on the subject but it has a lot of basic info which may seem trivial because it was made for a nonscientific audience. This comment goes over DHA levels in the blood and why they will naturally be low vit E and its relation to DD in the brain and also testosteroneestrogen and its relation to DD in the liver and how it relates to malefemale differences especially the production of sperm.Regarding the measurement of DHA conversion I dont believe it can be measured accurately and this is extremely important regarding studies that claim to measure conversion of plant fats to DHA. DHA is quite an unstable molecule and as such it is specifically created from EPA in controlled environments. For instance DHA is made onsite from EPA within the brain where it is a necessary constituent. There is no real need for large amounts of DHA in the blood nor in red blood cells specifically as the blood is often exposed to free radicals via the diet. DHA is retained in the brain and does not move in large amounts to the blood. Thus low DHA levels in the blood does not necessarily indicate low total DHA synthesis as the synthesized DHA will be in certain locations not in the blood. The data saying DHA conversion is lt. is I think from red blood cell measurements.An example of this is with vitamin E. I cant find my source at the moment unfortunately but I recall that in the brain DD is upregulated by vit E. DD being the rate limiting factor of conversion of EPA to DHA this indicates that evolutionary speaking it is better to convert EPA to DHA in the presence of sufficient levels of vit E. Vit E being a powerful antioxidant it being in high levels indicates relatively low amounts of free radicals. This is an example of DHA being synthesized in a specific location when specific conditions are met in order to protect that unstable molecule from oxidation.Unfortunately I no longer have access to ScienceDirect journals and cant find my original sources I cant find my notes! this paper seems to be support the idea that LCPUFAs downregulate DD in the liver the rate limiting factor. This is a negative feedback loop as once enough LCPUFAs have been created from ALA and LA the conversion process is slowed. Of note is that this downregulation is not sensitive to omega  vs omega  LCPUFAs just the level of unsaturation so eating a lot of AA omega  LCPUFA can downregulate ALA conversion SCPUFA omega .edit forgot to link paper!  sorry no public access I can look for better ones if you wantAlso of note is that this conversion rate is also regulated by Testosterone vs Estrogen. High testosterone and low estrogen downregulates PUFA conversion while low testosterone and high estrogen upregulates it. This means that females are presumably better at converting plant fats and that is very interesting in many ways!On the one hand females need more LCPUFAs than males because of the need to give large amounts to their offspring either in the womb or later via milk.On the other hand males being the hunters in certain time periods Id assume they would be eating more meat. Perhaps they will be eating fish on long hunting excursions and thus are not in as much need to convert SCPUFAs. This is of course speculation however.While Im on the subject there is also a connection to sperm which contains nontrivial amounts of DHA. After ejactulation new sperm must be created and thus omega  fats will be diverted from the rest of the body probably made from scratch from blood EPA if I had to guess. This means that the PUFA conversion process needs to be increased to maintain homeostasis and we do find that after ejaculation testosterone levels drop thus upregulating DD. Perhaps that isnt the main reason testosterone levels are affected by ejaculation but it is an interesting correlation. Testosterone levels are highest iirc  or so days after ejaculation thus meaning that PUFA synthesis is also lower and this happens to coincide with the fact that there is no need to be producing large amounts of DHA containing sperm.Hopefully you find this interesting. If you have questions Id be glad to help or maybe spend some extra time looking for the dang sources.,vegan,d6k9xdx,3,t5_2qhpm

8674567,0,t3_4yrgzv,Its hard having such a low budget but I dont understand how there could be cheaper food than rice and beans.I have some solutions because I am in similar situation with reduced mobility though not as hard as you have it financially.  It does take increasing your budget.Look into your grocery stores and see if they offer delivery.  My grocery store delivers to me but requires a minimum of  and a  delivery fee.  You can reduce the delivery fee by buying more food less often if thats possible.  This might not be realistic for you.I dont mean to ask of things that might be sensitive but have you considered looking into being legally disabled if you havent?  That would help with your budget.  I dont know this for sure but that could also help with food being delivered if you can get a care worker to help. Other solutions are food stamps and food pantries.  Im sure you are aware of these options but I think its important to bring up because I have relied on all these programs at some point in my life.Stock up on beans and rice as the bulk of your food and supplement with seasoning.  You can get prepackaged seasoning and turn rice and beans into all different kinds of meals.  Creole seasoning  taco seasoning chili seasoning and a bottle of terriyaki sauce gets you four different meals out of just rice and beans.

That is only my opinion and only a reflection of where I am right now in my vegan lifestyle. I think one also has to consider whether or not there is a transition period between becoming vegan and enjoying vegan food as much as a nonvegan diet flavorpleasure only and if there is a say one to two year adjustment period is that lost pleasure made up for by the pleasure of a vegan diet once the person is used to it. I guess that can only be possible if a vegan diet is more pleasurable than a nonvegan diet. If both diets provide equal pleasure then the pleasurable time lost during the transition would not be regained.Again I am arguing as though lifestyle improvements are nonexistent I am referring only to tastederived pleasure. I do believe that on the whole being vegan is more pleasurable than eating a standard American diet because of the increased vitality I feel daily. Positions on these questions will probably vary widely from person to person. Your opinion and beliefs are  valid to me.,vegan,d6yytt5,0,t5_2qhpm

Where I live the few vegan restaurants are very cool places to eat always packed and always expensive.  But they arent the only trendy places that jack up their prices. It can cost as much to buy a sandwich from a food truck and eat it standing up in a parking lot as it does to buy one in a restaurant  without any place to wash your hands sit down no wait staff to refill your drink no AC in summer etc.  But its cool to go to food trucks so we all pretend that were getting just as good a dining experience as we would in a restaurant and we pay top dollar for it.

8824343,0,t3_5107h4,If youll only have Korean ingredients Id start with looking at Korean recipes and how to make ones that are already vegan or can be easily made vegan.  Maangchis youtube channel is very popular wellmade and has a vegetarian section may of the dishes are vegan If youre just starting out begin with the easiest ones from that list that only have  or  ingredients rice       Garaeddeok     growing mung bean sprouts     growing soy bean sprouts      toasting sesame seeds    Yuja tea    Then move on to the ones that have a few about  to  ingredients steamed broccoli    Sigeumchinamul     spicy cucumber side dish    pickled radish   Then move on to the ones that have a few more about gt  ingredients  Eggplant side dish    seasoned seaweed   Japchae    This is plenty to learn for now.  It would have taken me weeks to learn just this much when I was starting out so dont think this all has to be learned in one day or one week.   After that you can move on to looking at just regular Korean recipes that might include animal products and teach yourself how to modify them to become vegan.  Youll begin to know enough about cooking to know for yourself how you want to cook.  The two main things you can do to recipes with animal products to make them veagn is     . Omit the animal products if they arent going to change the dish too much.  An example of this would be omitting the pork in Jjajangmyeon    Dishes in which meat dairy and egg are a small part of the overall final dish work well for this because when you take out the meat dairy and egg components theres still a lot of other stuff going on in the dish. Another example might be Bibimbap in which you would omit the fried egg and beef.  There are so many other ingredients in Bibimbap you wont miss the egg and meat quite as much.  .  Replace the animal products with plantbased ingredients if omitting them would take away too much of the dish.  An example of this would be replacing fish cakes with Garaeddeok in Eomukbokkeum and basically just using the sauce you would have used on fish cakes on Garaeddeok instead  Dishes in which meat dairy and egg can be easily replaced for something else that has a similar taste or texture or for which you have a lot of other options to replace them with work well for this method.  Fish cakes are never going to have exactly the same taste as Garaeddeok but they can both be filling and both have a satisfying texture so you might find Garaeddeok and acceptable replacement for that reason.  Another example might be replacing shredded crab sticks with shredded vegetables in this Naengchae  I.e. because there are many acceptable alternatives choosing to replace works here.  Learning what the best replacements for meat eggs and dairy are for a particular recipe takes a little experience.  This is getting really far ahead but in the future here are some things you can eventually try tofu seitan vegan meat replacements to replace meat soy sauce to replace fish sauce vegetable oil to replace animal fat etc.  Keep in mind that some dishes like Dakgangjeong are so deeply animalproductbased there arent really going to be any ways to perfectly recreate them with vegan ingredients but after not eating them for a couple weeks you may find you miss them less and less anyway.  ,vegan,d78kbiq,10,t5_2qhpm

So thats how in america  the pizza places can sell these ultra cheap. and if they buy vegan cheese it is more expensive because there arent forced subsidies. there is a really big issue here that so few people know or talk about. It really is the biggest fear in agriculture and fast food because of their lower costs due to feeding off the taxpayer through subsidized product that these producers will lose the subsidies and corporate welfare. Fewer people eating their products means less rationale for getting the corporate welfare and stealing from everyone.

The good thing about it is that is doesnt have to be hard when you first start so its more approachable I think than just telling someone to start hitting the gym. When you meet up with your parents suggest going on a walk while you catch up. If you are having dinner with an unhealthy friend suggest cooking something simple and healthy together instead of going to a restaurant. If you can get people to see that its easy to fit in a few minutes of movement here and there or to eat good nutritious food they wont be so resistant to it.Also it might help to suggest some books or films that are more about the food industry in general and not just about plant based eating. I really like Omnivores Dilemma and in Defense of Food to get people focused on more whole foods based and local food and why thats important. I think its more approachable to hear about why the massive corn industry is detrimental and why CAFOs are a bad thing when you arent shaming people for eating meat as a general thing. For me those books were like lightbulbs that food has been engineered as a pleasure mechanism for people rather than a survival tool. It took a few years but I now see food in an entirely different manner than I used to. Before it was a constant source of anxiety for me. I battled with eating disorders and feeling miserable all of the time. Trying to figure out dinner would turn into a total meltdown of me wanting to eat things and then feeling guilty for eating. When I realized that really what I needed to do was eat whole foods focusing on nutrition that anxiety went away. I still enjoy a lot of food and treats but once I got into a nutritious eating routine I realized how awful meat and dairy and junk food made me feel. I eat food that is good for me because it fuels my body not just because it sends pleasure signals to my brain. People have to break those habits just like you do with smoking etc.Anyway I think the more you approach it as hey try this with me because I think its interestingfunmakes you feel good the more open they will be.

I heard of one educated person who responded to a vegan argument by questioning whether animals can feel paineven though we have every behavioral physiological and evolutionary reason to believe that they can. This person wasnt uncompassionate rather his defenses were up. But eventually he was persuaded by the opposing argument. His name is Peter Singer. ,vegan,d7hkpix,13,t5_2qhpm

8909474,0,t3_52b1cq,As much as youd expect this answer beans and rice. Though I only feed me and my sister for the most part you can get a good amount of filling meals with beans and rice. I use brown rice and I usually have a can of black beans or garbanzo beans on hand though its even cheaper if you buy in bulk and cook them yourself. I would if I had the space to do it. Other than that I always have SOME type of canned vegetable and spices that I splurged on. It goes a long way though. Another easy way to save money is to get creative. Dont always follow recipes or whatever and sort of learn what foods go well with each other so you can use a lot of different ingredients to make a flavor profile which also helps get in different vitamins and such and avoids the whole eating the exact same thing every day bit. The only vegan alternative I ALWAYS have no matter what is butter. I usually have milk but if I dont I usually have almonds or cashews that I can make my own with. If I can Ill have sour cream and cheese but theyre not really necessary. EDIT Since I only make food for  Ill usually only make food for  or  in case we want some later. Id say that I spend an average of  for  serving meals. ,vegan,d7isf2p,2,t5_2qhpm

The answer to that question is pretty crucial to solving the problem. What makes you decide not to have a meal?If you want to gain weight and you have appetite loss I really dont recommend working out.

8954235,0,t3_52wuoa,I see your posts a lot in here. If I were in your position Id try a new vegan diet. Try high carb low fat most longterm vegans will tell you that high carb low fat is the game changer. To me it looks like you eat too much nuts seeds and fats and not enough whole carbsfor my diet anyways to sustain energy. Eat more fruit also Im not talking like  banana in the morning thats nothing but like  or  bananas will make you feel like running lolAlso Id wein off the zinc and magnesium. Keep b and vitamin d if you dont get sun but Id add iodine if you dont eat table salt. Also if you have constipation try probioitcs andor enzymes For a while they work for most people and because of a good reason most people dont have a healthy gut biom at all and once you get some good bacteria in they start taking over and are a total game changer they also help with weight loss and skin issues.  Gut health is a major factor in overall health and nothing will improve it like probioitcs . If you go low fat you also wont need ehadpa stuff because you wont have an abnormally high omega ratio from the abnormal oils a tbsp of Chia seeds and an  to  avocado a day is all the added fat I usually eat and I feel great. Keeps a great omega ratio also and puts me around  fat which i found works great for me. When Im traveling I dont even add any fats because theyre too expensive and I dont need a bulk pack of Chia seeds for a few days lol. Also a body in motion tends to stay at motion. Starting your day off with a little excersize and movement will give you energy throughout the day most likely and as long as you stay carbed up you shouldnt crash. Most people pm crash is because theyre not getting enough glucose to their brain,vegan,d7o5ymk,3,t5_2qhpm

Campaigns against rape culture include signs like Dont Get Raped Slutwalk and adding consent as a topic in our sex education curriculums.

Theres absolutely no need to hit or hurt in any way its just lazy horsemanship. Obedience comes from trust and playing a leadership role NOT from fear or learned helplessness.That said hitting is so pervasive that its normalized and taught to children. Ive heard people say horses arent sensitive and cant feel it but my mare can feel a feather touch. Ive heard that horses bite and kick each other far harder and its just mimicking that behaviour but horses have a hierarchy and strict social rules and they give proper warnings before following through. When a human hits it often comes out of nowhere and just upsets and confuses them.Its so normalized its unlikely anybody will take a complaint seriously unless he actually injured his horse.,vegan,d7sifz6,5,t5_2qhpm

I tend to hate the flavor of a lot of greens so I hide it in a  fruit smoothie I also throw my ground flax seed in my smoothie and it makes is so creamy and gives me my omegas.  You could try eating more beans they tend to pack a punch with calories. A cup of black beans is about  calories according to google.

For this reason reduced net primary productivity in some places is IMO a benefit rather than a cost of climate change. Sadly climate change may also increase net primary productivity in other places and a full analysis of the pros and cons of climate change is complex That linked piece mentions Greater rselection? as one possible side effect of climate change.

These submissions benefit from having fewer posts to compete against since less was being posted during the previous hours they benefit from being posted right as people are getting online in the morning and therefore have a full day of heavy viewership and more people than you would expect view reddit during working hours.There have been several posts on rdataisbeautiful looking into this and you can use Reddit Later to see when the most top posts are being made to any specific subreddit.,vegan,d856yis,3,t5_2qhpm

My aunt his mother even told me that she agrees with me and reduced her meatintake but doesnt have the courage and willpower to stand up for that as I did.Nowadays  years later after having done some research on how to do a better job at advocacy Id act differently and just ask socraticmethodstyle questions.But people around me just dont bring it up anymore...

Hot for Foods Nacho Style GaryI use it to make nachos and I imagine it would be an awesome sauce for things like baked potatoes or steamed broccoli. Hot for Foods Mozzarella Style Gary This is so good on pizza. I make mine with sauteed mushrooms roasted red pepper this Gary jarred tomato sauce and plenty of fresh basil and parsley. Its so so good. Keepin it Kinds Chevre Style Gary I like to use this to stuff those sweet mini peppers. I make the recipe cut the peppers in half fill them with this Gary then put some basil and balsamic vinegar or balsamic syrup on top and pop them in the oven for like  minutes until theyre warm. Even though chevre wouldnt normally be used in quesadillas this recipe works well in quesadillas with things like roasted corn on pizzas on top of salads tossed with pasta and just on bread by itself or with other things to make crostini.A Gary Recipe from Isa Chandra Moskowitzs Instagram . cups cashews cup water teaspoon salt Tablespoon miso Tablespoons nutritional yeast Tablespoons refined coconut oil teaspoons onion powderbig pinch turmericThis is the perfect sauce for Mac and Gary. Havent found anything better than this. Baked Almond Feta Style Gary I dont make this recipe very often in its original form but I make the other recipes this blog author came up with that use this Gary all the time. The Spanikopita and Orzo Bake are my favorites. Those recipes are also much quicker than the original recipe because you just blitz up the ingredients from the original recipe in a blender and mix it in with the orzo if youre making the bake or the spinach if youre making the Spanikopita. Then you just bake all that together for half an hour  no need to strain the Gary in cheesecloth overnight like in the original recipe. Those are all my absolute favorite Gary recipes!

Also check out Dr. Gregers video on DHA at You mention diet but if youre still using leather wool or products made using stearic acid etc. and want some encouragement to stop then seeing that blink in the documentary Earthlings will make you stop using animal ingredients in products outside food.

I use this recipe as a base to build on and I always use almond milk instead of water for the liquid and changeadd flavorings. It would be great as is with your green chile thrown in though. So. Cook your pasta most of the way in salty boiling water. Make cheese sauce when I made mac with it I doubled the recipe and heat up your oven in the meantime. When the pasta is ready drain it and mix with sauce. Get a glass baking dish and pour half of the mac in. Add a layer of creamy original chao cheese slices or your favorite vegan cheese slice. Chao worked perfectly for me and melted right into the mac. Cover cheeze layer with the rest of the mac and top with breadcrumbs.

It is scientific fact that animals are sentient and they suffer but whether or not you believe alleviating that suffering is worth your time is a thing.I am not religious and yeah sometimes those belief systems involve different ethical choices among other arguably useless practices. Nevertheless imo people are free to practice their religion sans anything willfully harmful even if I think its dumb.Lets focus on legitimizing veganism as a way of life that deserves that respect and show its an ethical choice without having to drag down religious people.

9372814,0,t3_58ue1l,Ive been raising chickens for over  years and only had a hen break into her eggs once and it was an accident. If theyre provided with lots of quality food and forage they dont need to replenish any nutrients with their eggs. This is a common antiegg eating argument I see and its very misleading.Taking the eggs doesnt necessarily impact how often the hen lays because most hens will simply abandon the egg go outside and just lay another one the next day regardless. Only a broody hen who is interested in sitting will eventually stop laying during the weeks shes tending her eggschicks. They also stop laying naturally during winter months. As far as health issues resulting from laying Ive only had one hen suffer a prolapse and it was a Bantam which really surprised me not even one of my heavy layer Barred Rocks. Ive lost a few here and there to reproductive cancer or peritonitis but almost always in older hens between  years of age which is pretty old for a chicken.The post you were linked to contains other misleading information like the bit about it being illegal to label eggs as healthy nutritious or good for you anything of that sort. This is not because eggs arent healthy or nutritious or bad for you but because the FDA which has very strict food labeling requirements has not defined or regulated those terms and wont allow anyone to use them on their products for that reasonIf a NCC Nutrient Content Claim is not included in FDAs regulations can it be used on a label?Answer No. Only those claims or their synonyms that are specifically defined in the regulations may be used. All other claims are prohibited. FDA Labeling Guide Nutrient Content ClaimsThis is also true for supplements many of which are clearly healthy and in some cases necessary B anyone?. According to FDA regulations all nutrient or health claims must be specific such as excellent source of vitamin D rich in fiber lowers cholesterol as part of a hearthealthy diet or high in calcium promotes bone health.

If you decide to do it anyways try and not traumatize them whenever the questions arise why all my friends eat meat? and the like and be as rational as you can about it children should not consume that much animals products either so their impact would be neglegible either way.

9513499,0,t3_5b3eks,Animal welfare is a doubleedged sword. Improving the animals conditions reduces the amount of suffering in the world but its also a way for people to feel good about a wrong action animal exploitation.A moral baseline is meant to be drawn in a place that separates right from wrong. That way you can use it to determine whether an action is justified or not depending on which side of the moral line the action lands. Its hard to find a good place to draw the moral baseline and there will always be a grey area around it but it is important to draw it having in mind that its purpose is to separate right from wrong.If you draw the line on the current barbaric state of things you risk making any small improvement look like a good deed. Yes your chickens can see sunlight but youre still enslaving torturing and killing them for no good reason. Yes you beat your children  times a week instead of  you decided to give them free weekends but youre still beating them. You may be reducing the amount of suffering in the world you may be making the world a better placeTM but is it good? Thats the question we should always ask and to answer it we need to draw a moral baseline in the correct place. We ought to strive to be good not merely better than yesterday especially if yesterday we behaved like monsters.,vegan,d9lqpdn,5,t5_2qhpm

9595046,0,t1_d9vpakp,Sorry its a little long winded Im just gonna copy and pasteThis is something I dont talk about often it usually annoys and upsets people and casts me in a negative light. But with Trump winning the presidency and just this whole election as a whole I wanted to bring it up. My one year vegan anniversary is coming up. The main reason I decided to no longer consume animal products was because of the environmental impact factory farming has on our climate. The only time the climate issue was remotely discussed during the debates was with Ken Bones question about energy policy and instead of focusing on the fact that neither candidate gave a good answer we made the man a meme. Flat out Trumps denial of global warming and his plans to lessen EPA restrictions bring back coal energy and withdraw from the Paris Agreement are terrifying. This is no longer a s hippie tree hugger issue  global warming is real and we are quickly approaching a state of no return. However there is something you can do as an individual to lessen our impact. Im not calling out for people to switch to veganism it is hard it is inconvenient. But it is easy to simply reduce your intake of animal products. Cut out dairy or red meat do meatless Monday try Veganuary this January pick a veggie burger over beef the next time you go out... even small steps count and raise awareness to those around you. There is an abundance of information on the positive impact veganism has and just how immensely factory farming is hurting our Earth and population. And if thats not enough for you by reducing your consumption you reap numerous health benefits and save millions of animals many with the intelligence equal to or greater than multiple species of dogs a miserable tortured existence at the hands of man. Sorry for the wall of text this is something I feel very passionately about but never talk about for fear of looking like a conspiracy nut. I hope from this just one person googles veganism and the environment and gets educated on a very real problem and a way that they can help. Our politicians not just Trump are ignoring climate change and we cant afford go backwards or keep waiting to make changes.,vegan,d9vsafm,30,t5_2qhpm

9608731,0,t1_d9xa6bp,So Ill start off with saying that from a vegan perspective where I have no desire or need  for meat and such eating humanely raised animals is weird. Its kind of a clarity you get when you no longer are reliant on these products that you realize its really fucking weird to raise a pig and treat it well but during its whole life be thinking Im going to eat your flesh friend.Aside from that I appreciate any sort of attempt from meat eaters to change for the better. Anything makes some difference! So if you want to eat humanely raised meat these are a couple things you have to take into consideration  A label saying humanely raised doesnt mean shit. There have been plenty of cases where these humane farms have turned out to be disgusting. You need to research a farm well before you buy its products. Better yet drive out to a local farm and meet the animals! You cant just take the packages word for it. Theyre lyyyyinngg. if you truly want to stick to humanely raised animal products this means you cant eat frozen meals or restaurant meals that have animal products. Theyre almost certainly not going to be using humanely raised animal products. Many people think theyre doing a good job not supporting factory farms when theyre buying their animal products from local farms but forget about prepackaged food and eating out!,vegan,d9xh0nf,8,t5_2qhpm

Most slave owners came to the realisation that their slaves are no good to them dead sure they can be tired battered broken and bruised but alive nonetheless. So while Im not sitting here and defending the concept of slavery because thats obviously stupid you do realise that the slave owners keeping them alive is a to correlation of your example of giving them food and cleaning the cat box.There are a multitude of other legitimate reasons why someone might want to become and stay vegan and its exclusively that individuals business on what the reason is and whether or not they want to make that choice in the first place.

9787364,0,t3_5fdorh,I think your concern is valid. If youre primarily worried about his cardiac health then I would suggest having a gentle nonjudgmental conversation where you specifically encourage him to make sure the checkups you mention in comments above have included close attention to his heart EKG echocardiogram possibly a stress test.... I would also recommend that you encourage him to have his blood tested for deficiencies and his cholesterol measured. I know what you mean about the sort of person who is reluctant to make changes until something bad happens but sadly that can be too late. Even if your friend isnt ready now or ever to become vegan reducing the amount of animal products in his intake would most likely be beneficial for him in terms of lowering cardiac and cancer risk as well as for animals and the environment.

I am aware of what the concerns are and what the government is capable of. I am generally in favor of privacy and security and promote privacy education.However it is my professional opinion that puffing up about using credit cards will inevitably do far more harm than good. More so when supposed privacy advocates go on literal tirades at the mere mention of someone using electronic means as their primary method of exchanging money. Its absurd.

9834213,0,t1_dap8o81,The protein in meat and diary can result in  insulin secretion if you are somehow overly sensitive to insulin or tend to overshoot in insulin production this may cause problems for you.  I would suggest that also as a vegan you include some complex carbohydrates into all meals and snacks to counteract this.Blood sugar control is linked in with many hormones some of them work in very slow regulatory mechanism some of them work very fast. If you somehow disbalanced your system it can take a long time to get back to normal but it is possible. The key is to avoid getting into low blood sugar states and not just bounce in high and low sugar it will probably confuse your body even more. Eat plenty and better eat frequently smaller meals than big ones for steady blood sugar.Regarding my diagnosis I have several blood test showing my low blood sugar of hypoglycemic states and also some of my disregulated hormonal system behind it. The interpretation of this I mostly did myself I have a background in molecular medicine and a lot more time on my hand to self diagnose and research then my endorkrinologist Regarding what fixed it I became vegan right around when the problem was  worst and within about a year I completely fixed the blood sugar part of the problem. Initially I made some mistakes eating a lot of dried fruitbaked goods which did nor work well for me I think if I started focussing on starches from whole foods sooner it may have improved much faster. You should know that there are indexes for glycemic and insulinemic indexes for many foods but that those are also dependent on every single individual so you should experminet a bit which foods work good for you. Also learn to watch yourself and recognize the hypoglycemic symptoms even if its sometimes just brainfog maybe consider buying a blood glucose meassuring device. If you do notice symptomse just eat some glucose tablets immediately and plan a good healthy meal within the next hour or so.I hope some of this was helpful to you ,vegan,dapf4zh,1,t5_2qhpm

I believe in leaving nature to take its own course not some fallacy but just minding our own business as much as is possible in this modern world whether that means animals die or not. If animals eat other animals in the wild then I dont see that as an excuse to capture that predator species to stop it eating other animals to save their lives I believe that is the Earths business and not ours. We should be focusing on our own survival. Keeping pet cats and dogs is not for our survival as you know we are now in a situation where we are taking them in just to correct the mistakes and greed of our own species. Maybe putting millions of cats and dogs to sleep is the most practical answer maybe it isnt thank fuck its never going to be me making any decision like that but for that to be effective we would have to ban all breeding and also ban all humans keeping these animals. If people can own them then the problem will just come back. What can I say people are stupid and that is being polite. I just keep out of it all.,vegan,dar305a,1,t5_2qhpm

These recommendations may also be dependent on training status experienced athletes would require less while more protein should be consumed during periods of high frequencyintensity training. Elevated protein consumption as high as .. g  kg  day depending on the caloric deficit may be advantageous in preventing lean mass losses during periods of energy restriction to promote fat loss.Because youre also restricting calories this generally means you need very high protein foods in the diet.

But like I said before most ethical vegans are against animal exploitation of any kind and probably wont be eating bugs any time soon  ,vegan,db0wo35,8,t5_2qhpm

When making a wok dont know the english word youll have enough moist from the veggies and wont need oil.  There are also things like bakingpaper but reusable and to put in a pan made of silicone like substances.  You can bake stuff on it like a meatreplacer its specially made so your things dont stick to the pan and become black or burned.  I dont know the English word for this.  But it removes the need for oil.  Sometimes I use pure tomatosauce to heat things in.  When preparing food like this you can for example boil sweet potatoes and celeriac and mash them together.  Bake fauxmeat to go with it.  It can be reheated.  ,vegan,db0ymad,2,t5_2qhpm

9927981,0,t1_db1m5sz,What you are talking about are SICs and Welfarist organizations promote them. SICs are a form of abolition that Abolitionists would never justify only Welfarists. gt Would this campaign I described be undesirable?Yesgt Welfarists claim that SICs by focusing on particular uses can after enough SICs add up to a challenge to animal use. So if we have a successful antifur campaign and eradicate fur we can move on to leather and then to wool. If we have a successful antifoie gras campaign and people stop eating foie gras we can move on to other meat. And when we have had successful SICs aimed at all different sorts of meat we can move on to dairy and then to eggs. But this scenario is nothing but a welfarist fantasy.Animal Rights The Abolitionist Approach pg .gt Consider the two longestrunning SICs the antifur campaign and the antivivisection campaign. The antifur campaign has been going on for  years now and the fur industry is stronger than ever. The antivivisection movement has been in existence for the better part of  years and more animals are being used in vivisection than ever before. SICs operate by arbitrarily distinguishing one product or use from other products or uses and by characterizing the target product or use as morally worse than the others. They build coalitions based on the common rejection of the target by coalition members who embrace other forms of exploitation that are morally indistinguishable from the target.Animal Rights The Abolitionist Approach pg .gt Examples of SICs include the antifur campaign campaigns against the consumption of dogs and cats in Asia campaigns for special protection for certain animals who are thought to be cognitively similar to humans nonhuman great apes or dolphins or who are otherwise thought to be special in some sense and campaigns against the use of chickens in ritual slaughter by Hassidic Jews. Although SICs are often characterized as seeking to abolish certain forms of exploitation in reality they merely promote the idea that certain forms of animal exploitation are to be preferred as morally acceptable.Animal Rights The Abolitionist Approach pg ,vegan,db1n38z,0,t5_2qhpm

Iron supplements are one of those tricky ones that you might not need a change of diet can often help. And its really easy to take too much without noticing. B is another story most people have no side effects from taking too much as too much isnt really a thing you just pee it out. A small percentage will get acne breakouts from it so keep an eye on that but B is the easiest thing to supplement.

What I understand of it at present is that direct confrontation will only lead to further entrenching their position  there will always be another excuse to justify their beliefs. Instead we need to coax them out offer information without any expectation of change. Let them save face by updating their views in light of new information instead of admitting to having been wrong the whole time.Thats all I have for the moment but it seemed to be a wise approach... its tough to keep that level head when confronted with images as disturbing as this one but that may be exactly when we need it most...,vegan,dbeo4sc,32,t5_2qhpm

10035128,0,t3_5jezd8,Here are some pointers taken from wkipidea from How to Win Friends and Influence People. On the topic of influencing others to you way of thinking.  .The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it. Whenever we argue with someone no matter if we win or lose the argument we still lose. The other person will either feel humiliated or strengthened and will only seek to bolster their own position. We must try to avoid arguments whenever we can..Show respect for the other persons opinions. Never say Youre wrong. We must never tell people flat out that they are wrong. It will only serve to offend them and insult their pride. No one likes to be humiliated we must not be so blunt..If youre wrong admit it quickly and emphatically. Whenever we are wrong we should admit it immediately. When we fight we never get enough but by yielding we often get more than we expected. When we admit that we are wrong people trust us and begin to sympathize with our way of thinking..Begin in a friendly way. A drop of honey can catch more flies than a gallon of gall. If we begin our interactions with others in a friendly way people will be more receptive. Even if we are greatly upset we must be friendly to influence people to our way of thinking..Start with questions to which the other person will answer yes. Do not begin by emphasizing the aspects in which we and the other person differ. Begin by emphasizing and continue emphasizing the things on which we agree. People must be started in the affirmative direction and they will often follow readily. Never tell someone they are wrong but rather lead them where we would like them to go with questions that they will answer yes to..Let the other person feel the idea is his or hers. People inherently like ideas they come to on their own better than those that are handed to them on a platter. Ideas can best be carried out by allowing others to think they arrived at it themselves..Try honestly to see things from the other persons point of view. Other people may often be wrong but we cannot condemn them. We must seek to understand them. Success in dealing with people requires a sympathetic grasp of the other persons viewpoint..Be sympathetic with the other persons ideas and desires. People are hungering for sympathy. They want us to recognize all that they desire and feel. If we can sympathize with others they will appreciate our side as well and will often come around to our way of thinking..Appeal to the nobler motives. Everyone likes to be glorious in their own eyes. People believe that they do things for noble and morally upright reasons. If we can appeal to others noble motives we can successfully convince them to follow our ideas..Dramatize your ideas. In this fast paced world simply stating a truth isnt enough. The truth must be made vivid interesting and dramatic. Television has been doing it for years. Sometimes ideas are not enough and we must dramatize them..Throw down a challenge. The thing that most motivates people is the game. Everyone desires to excel and prove their worth. If we want someone to do something we must give them a challenge and they will often rise to meet it.,vegan,dbflqsu,5,t5_2qhpm

Look at humans we have doctors who specialize in assisting in birth and we still die all the time or are severely injured by birth.

Regarding the milking machine would you put it on your nipples twice a day for a month? If not why? One thing I do want to mention is that while it is nice to picture a wholesome small farm as much as marketers would like us to the milk the general public buys is  times coming from a factory farm unless they have the funds and want to seek it out. Small farms the way you describe it cannot scale to a large enough size to accommodate the publics demand without compromising further on the animals well being in the name of efficiency.

Keep things spotless clean up crumbs etc. If you see a line of them follow it backwards to see where theyre getting in. Its hard to  bugproof but if you make it really difficult with little reward theyll move on to greener pastures after a short while. Take a look around and make sure theyre not nesting indoors somewhere. We had a very persistent wave of ants that refused to leave no matter what we tried. Realized eventually they were living in the house nesting in one of our potted plants. Moved the plant outdoors problem gone. Use lots of deterrents. These arent  but they do help. Lemon juice is good wipe it everywhere they like to congregate. You can also sprinkle lemon peel zest cinnamon vinegar etc. Stuff that messes with their scent trails. You can also use baby powder or baking soda they wont cross a line of the stuff so you can use it strategically to exclude them. Basically just undertake a nonstop campaign of harassment.

He cant fly and has trouble crawling he would be unable to hide into a hole to protect humself from our horrible canadian winters. So yeah Im hoping that he will be able to heal a bit a bit and gain forces. After reading online about them they are really fascinating creatures! They are also incredibly clean. He constantly washes himself he has a really really beautiful soft fur. But Im trying to handle and touch him the least to not damage his survival instinct and give him a chance to maybe regain the wild if his wing gets better!Edit Also thank you for the kind words of encouragement! I really appreciate it! I found it really hard to see him in this state at first but Im getting tougher and feeling more comfortable seeing him like that.

10127356,0,t1_dbrko12,gtSaying something is true does not make it so.This is true! However shared mammalian endocrine and nervous system physiology as well as pretty much all scientific investigation of the topic since science became a thing are very strong indicators that many different species of mammals  indeed do have feelings and preferences in much the same way human beings do. In fact a recent study indicates pigs in particular even share certain fairly advanced personality traits with us like being optimists or pessimists. Meanwhile your argument largely stems from the Cartesian as in Renee Descartes the philosopher born in  view of animals as automatons responding to physiological stimuli like elaborately constructed dolls. Feel free to cling to this idea if you really want to but it strikes me as fairly intellectually dishonest in the face of the overwhelming evidence that takes about two minutes of googling to find. It is an extremely bad idea to base your argument on this if you want to continue eating meat because its very easy to disprove.  hence my conflation with my cat  they are not exactly the same of course but so closely related physiologically and behaviorally to each other and us that its not really a problem to aruge in this way when were talking about extremely basic things like experiencing emotions and having preferences.,vegan,dbrlmlr,5,t5_2qhpm

I believe in equal treatment in the way that Singer descries it equal consideration of interests. Obviously pigs have no interest in voting so they dont deserve to be given that right but if they when they feel pain it hurts as badly for them as it does for us then it matters as much.

Spanking them for not eating food they dont like. Yelling at them while they cry and try to gag it down. Ive heard a few stories of kids people I know as adults who refused to eat and were served the same thing over and over until they finally caved and ate it because they were fucking starving. Just because you suffered one particular brand of abuse doesnt mean everyone has had the same experience. Some kids dont have the choice you did and some kids may be damaged by the same information you felt empowered by. Do you want to take the chance of making something harder on a kid who already has a rough time of it?

10166665,0,t1_dbwcbcj,Out of curiosity would the comic hold more water with you if instead of a human committing the murder it was a cow a la The Far Side? It would avoid drawing comparisons with cannibalism while still getting the point across I think.Anyway. Yes it is an extreme comic but it echoes reality for a lot of us in this sub. We hear these exact arguments on a regular basis and we consider them ridiculous. It can be frustrating hearing people we care about spouting them laughing at us for our choices. In my case I actively do not talk about being vegan unless I have to because so many people take it upon themselves to argue about it with me when all Im trying to do is eat my lunch. There is a social stigma associated with veganism as the vocal minority think PETA paint an extreme picture of what is in the end supposed to be a compassionate choice.These frustrations get ranted about on here and it can become a toxic sounding board if not kept in check. Those posts get heavily upvoted make it to the front page and the rest is history.Finally thank you for being civil with your explanation. Makes a nice change ,vegan,dbwg4by,6,t5_2qhpm

10169903,0,t1_dbwry3r,Mate really nice to see such a well worded reply thanks. I agree with a lot of what you said and think that you answered everything well. Putting the comic behind us I shall go and have a look at rdebatevegan and see whats there. Being totally honest I am about as far from a  typical vegan as it is possible to be. I am a cook grew up in the country hunt etc. I like eating meat I shant lie however that does not mean I do not understand and empathise with elements of the vegan cause. From the vegan perspective I am an outright hypocrite and perhaps I am really but I incorporate certain things within my lifestyle to try and do better. I go out of my way to not wear leather or animal product and source my food as ethically as possible. No for the latter I know that probably means little to a vegan but I do feel it does make a difference. The vast majority of meat that I eat has been raised within  miles of where I live sometimes on my own farm. I dont eat dairy anyway and find plant alternatives preferable. Certain aspects of veganism I dont necessarily agree with. I wont eat eggs from a battery farm for example as we have our own hens but I do not feel as though it is wrong of me to eat an egg from a very happy healthy chicken like Im some sort of animal aggressor. Im rambling a bit...What I am trying to say is that I eat meat out of choice because it is important ? to me but realise that in other areas such as animal products if there is an alternative that has not come from an animal I will choose it over its counterpart that has. ,vegan,dbwtbt2,2,t5_2qhpm

Then again I support a lot of small vegan and veganfriendly businesses with my patronage and a handful of regulars can make the difference between success and failure of a small town restaurant. I used a vegan small business doing foodfestival kind of things for my wedding catering which was probably a k job and about six months later they opened their first brick and mortar location.

Honey on the other hand the bees make in order to survive winters so they need that honey where as they dont need the fruit that they produce by pollination the just need the pollen itself which they get anyway. I have very little knowledge of this but I dont see how eating pollinated fruit is the same as taking bees honey?

Theyre unflavored so they taste like complete ass which is why I just drink it before working out instead of sipping on it. It isnt bad if you put it in a water bottle with something flavored and sip on it throughout your workout.Like uyoonamaniac said Kaged is fermented vegan. Allmax leucine is nonanimal and Im assuming its vegan but Im not . Ive also read a bunch of places that purple wraath is vegan but its not just BCAAs. IMO purple wraath is a great intraworkout drink. Tastes good not great but good for a BCAAEAA and has some good energypump ingredients though its a bit underdosed.

10238124,0,t1_dc4gvqx,You may be surprised I am an exprimary producer. I grew up and worked on a small highwelfare pig farm so I get that they would be upset. But those feelings whilst often genuine are not consistent with theirmy overall actions. Once I left that environment and was looking back at it through the eyes of someone without any investment in the process I saw it very differently and a lot of the conflicts that I had hid from myself whilst farming surfaced. There is a lot of force and coercion involved even in even a highwelfare outfit but we didnt see it as such because it was normal. I expect that you do not see it as such or see it as being necessary it isnt by the way. And we were the nice kind of people who consciously didnt completely max out the pregnancy rates of our sows so they were exhausted and went to slaughter may be a year or so later than a bigger outfit would burn through their lives. We did not act as we felt. If we had actually seen our pigs as the sentient creatures worthy of affection that we thought we did we could not have treated them the way we did. But it was the attitude of the slaughter house workers that freaked me even back then. It wasnt that they saw our precious pigs as commodities to be handled without feeling it was that they were more violent than if they had seen them as inanimate objects. I have seen this elsewhere since then people blunted to the fact that they dealing with sentient animals using a callous force completely unnecessary for the task in hand apparently unaware that they are doing it.As is so often the way a cartoon sums up the contradiction about what we did with me as the butt of it.That is the basis for my disagreement with animalwelfare as a goal.

10283797,0,t3_5n9da3,Very few studies have been done looking specifically at the health effects of organic or grassfed animal products. So everything we know is based upon looking at the differences in nutrients in organic vs nonorganic animal products to try work out which is healthier. You can read a good review of this here Composition differences between organic and conventional meat a systematic literature review and metaanalysisWhat we do know is that grassfed beef compared to grainfed beef contains a healthier fatty acid profile with lower overall fat and greater omega fatty acids. Similarly grassfed dairy contains less saturated fat and more omega fatty acidsAlso similarly eggs from hens with access to grass contain more omega fatty acids and also contains more carotenoids in the egg yolkSo in summary we dont really have the evidence that specifically shows organic and grassfed animal products are as unhealthy as nonorganic factoryfarmed meat. We have some evidence that suggests organic and grassfed meat may be healthier but we dont know how much benefit this would actually be and if that benefit is enough to counteract the demonstrated negative health effects of excessive consumption of animal products.,vegan,dc9q3si,10,t5_2qhpm

If there is no need to eat meat because of whats done on the post or other methods like simple and cheap supplements then we shouldnt eat meat or kill animals for food to be precise or pay others to do it. We would be causing unnecessary harm to living and sentient beings which I hope you agree is immoral.gtBoth situations are so st century lolAnd vegetarianism can be traced in human history back to fucking Pythagoras and others philosophers and was already a movement in US by the th century.

10294024,0,t1_dcauzcy,Even if you had fifty links I dont think thats enough to generalize from. I could just provide fifty more that suggest the opposite.I understand your feelings. Its like were judging you because to be vegan means to believe that certain uses for animals are typically objectionable. Notice though that to say an action is objectionable isnt to necessarily say that the agent is blameworthy. It sounds like it does and the distinction Im trying to make is subtle but I wanna press it anyway. Many vegans understand where omnis are coming from many have been there. I went through the greater portion of my life believing there wasnt even a moral dimension to my food choices let alone thinking buying animal food products was wrong. And Im not entirely sure that my being in the position to reconsider my beliefs wasnt purely a matter of circumstantial luck. So if youre a vegan aware of these things and you wanna see change what do you do? Personally I try to just talk about the moral status of certain practices or actions without trying to make it personal. I dont think youre a bad person for being a meat eater I just wish youd consider the arguments Id like to show you.,vegan,dcavtgi,3,t5_2qhpm

If veganism took so much restraint most vegans wouldnt do it. Were humans after all. Believe me I respect vegans because of their willpower is common logic amongst most omnis before they go vegan. Everyone thinks its super hard when its really not that hard. Just for shits you should try looking up some recipes on rveganrecipes or this sub and see if you could eat vegan for a day. Im not gonna lie and say that there isnt pressure sometimes to eat nonvegan or that you wont ever feel temptations to eat meat or dairyfilled food but if you really have conviction in being opposed to cruelty and you eat good food those temptations will be minimal or nonexistent. Its pretty easy to be vegan. Like someone else suggested watch the movie Earthlings. Its really eyeopening. ,vegan,dcbnvfx,10,t5_2qhpm

10395813,0,t1_dclbdjg,Its a certain strategy in vegan activism.The philosophy of this sort of activism rests on the idea that most people who eat animal products dont really think about what they eat as animals. Not that they dont know intellectually that animal products come from animals. They just dont relate it to how they think of animals. Thats why so many people say I love animals and still eat meat. The two concepts animals as beings and animals as food exist independently of each other in the persons psychology. This isnt universal of course but many of us believe that its very common.So one way of spreading veganism that we tend to feel is very effective is to try and close that gap between the concept of animals that people love and that concept of animals that people eat. Many people when these concepts merge and they suddenly realize that they are eating the thing that they love begin their journey towards veganism. Anecdotes on this sub will show that many of us have a sort of moment of awakening where we came to this realization and started taking steps to change our lifestyle.Pictures like this often work to close this gap. People first see something cute. They see personality emotion and desire in these chicks who clearly seek warmth and take pleasure in it. Thats something they can relate to and empathize with. This activates the concept of animals that I love. But they are chickens. Baby chickens. And people know that they eat chicken. And this stimulates animals that I eat. And now both concepts are stimulated at the same time about the same animal. That creates cognitive dissonance. People react to it differently. Some might selfreflect and reconsider assumptions and habits. Most probably just ignore and move on. Some react with spite and anger towards vegans. But even that is useful because their toxic overreaction actually influences people in the middle to be more open minded about what vegans have to say.Does that answer your question?,vegan,dcmfk04,1,t5_2qhpm

10443484,0,t3_5pj47i,She has what I like to call Passionate Vegan Syndrome. Its hard not to fall into that trap as a new vegan. I think what a lot of omnivore people dont understand is that when someone goes vegan their entire worldview changes. They see things differently and get so caught up thinking How can other people not see what Im seeing? so to them their actions are justifiable no matter how shitty theyre being. But what a lot of new vegans dont realize is that yes its okay to be passionate about it but we also have to still treat people nicely and be relatable. I think thats the only way to see eye to eye is to find common ground. I understand why your friend feels the way that she does but shes going about it all wrong and reacting very poorly. She should lead through education and example not through putting people down and disparaging them. No one will listen to you if you insult them. I suggest maybe showing your friend these comments from other vegans if you dont want her seeing this thread there are very similar threads in this subreddit you can show her and she might realize how abrasive shes being. tldr I get why shes being a shit head but she still has a lot of learning and growing to do as a new vegan.,vegan,dcrump2,5,t5_2qhpm

10489433,0,t1_dcx1t4n,Your issues are likely caused by inflammation via your microbiome not producing enough butyrate to signal to your immune system to stand down. The fact that plant foods give you stomach pain further leads me to believe you simply havent built up a decent amount of bacteria in your intestines to digest the resistance starches and fiber in them. I used to suffer from very intense stomach pain as well and it would get really terrible whenever I ate fiber. The problem?.. I was eating way too much fiber way too quickly. It will take weeks to months to effectively build up your microbiome it naturally would have been building your entire life eating huge volumes of plant foods out in the wild but modern times have brought about processed foods and made them the norm. I remember when I was transitioning into a wholefoods vegan diet I ate some tempeh. Not even a full slab of tempeh just a few squares. Later that evening I almost went to the hospital because I was in such intense pain I was literally screaming in the bathroom it was so bad. The problem is that tempeh is high as fuck in fiber and I hadnt eaten enough fiber or resistant starch to have a decent microbiome capable of digesting it.Not trying to chastise you at all my friend Im only here to help because I have a lot of experience with nutrition. You sound genuinely sad that you need to purchase animal products. If Im reading this correctly then I have some advice for you that could really change your life as it has mine. What you need to do is slowly repair your digestive system. I recommend considering your fiber sensitivity to increase your fiber intake by  grams daily. You may get some gas and discomfort and if you do dont panic its totally normal. A good way to do this is incorporate sweet potatoes into your diet as well as your favorite vegetables and fruits. Bananas arent too high in fiber so theyre excellent.  Legumes and whole grains are something you need to be cautious with beans and lentils are high af in fiber. Id recommend eating  cup of lentilsbeans daily until you can consume . cups and so on. I eat about  cups of black beans  cups of brown rice and  cups of lentils daily and I very rarely have any gas at all. Avoiding inflammation causing foods is huge. It will be hard as you cannot eat much fiber so most foods you eat will be slightly inflammatory but try to monitor your omega  intake and incorporate chia seedsflax seeds immediately to balance it out. Heres a video explaining why you likely have inflammation. The rest is up to you good luck man. ,vegan,dcx35fk,1,t5_2qhpm

Depending on the city you go to therell be plenty of vegan friendly restaurants  Happycow is probably a good place to check that beforehand.

Of course Im not aware of the exact amount of animals who are directly saved through these kinds of measures in other parts of the world such as New Zealand so I cant make a definitive judgement. But Im generally skeptical of the idea that certain species are worth protecting more than others and from what Ive seen here in Canada it has the potential to do more harm than good.One example is the spotted owl a species that was declared endangered a while ago. A few years back spotted owls were almost completely gone from their Canadian habitat  at one point in time they estimated that there might only be about a dozen owls left. To preserve the species they turned to its main competitor the barred owl and started either relocating them or killing them off. I dont know all the numbers but it seems that at least  barred owls were killed to help those  spotted ones thrive. And what for? The barred owls had already taken over the ecological niche. At that point all that they were preserving were the spots really.,vegan,ddct5m8,4,t5_2qhpm

A braindead person by definition is unable to experience pain  animals in animal experiments do experience pain. Your braindead analogy would work for plant experimentation however and possibly on other creatures without a cerebral cortex such as clams but thats not what were discussing here.I put higher value on reducing the suffering of a creature with higher emotional and analytical intelligence this would for instance also include higher primates because everything I know about suffering tells me the greater the depths of emotional understanding the greater the depth of suffering itself.Where do mentally disabled people fit into this model of morality?

One is useful the other is not. Try to get Omegaintake as low as possible and Omegaintake as low as necessary.Having lower amounts of Omega also isnt directly crucial. Your immunecells are made anyways but they will have a slightly different composition and be slightly less effective at doing what they are supposed to do. The Omega  is made into an enzyme that is part of the cellwalls of those cells and acts as some sort of sensor to detect threats.Often times people put out correlations to try and prove its usefulness with no biochemical explanation.Also note that by being vegan you are far less burdened by endotoxins which the immunesystem will care about which in turn also reduces the requirements for Omega.I would refrain from supplementing it as well as long theres no acute medical reason to do so.,vegan,dde9ox2,1,t5_2qhpm

10664990,0,t1_ddfxm9w,Nowhere have a expressed support for experimenting on disabled people. and Ive also given my strongest reasons why I am against it twice.gtHere are some of my thoughts about mentally disabled Of course I feel like we should not do sth like that. gt I still would say we should not be experimenting on humans like this basically out of a slippery slope concern.However I do not categorically exclude experimenting on disabled humans because I can think of very very hypothetical circumstances where it would indeed be moral to do so. Imagine the mentally disabled person was also unable to feel pain the experiment would only entail cutting him in the finger once and there would be a good chance that the result of the experiment would be to find a cure for all forms of cancer and a committee of experts discussed the science and ethics and has officially approved the procedure. Under those circumstances I think experimenting on a disabled person would be moral however those circumstances are also completely unrealistic to happen. The example Ive given is obviously crazy unlikely it reminds me of the experimental question that psychologists used about the train that is out of control und heading to kill a group of people and you have to make a decision on whether you would be willing to pull a lever that would switch the train from heading down the track where  people stand to track where  person stands? Are you familiar with this example? Im not trying to evade the argument here in contrast I think this is the very core of the problem.

The difference between a human animals rights and a nonhuman animals rights are constructs of the powerful not of justice. And the comparison is well used in this context. If you have concluded that a nonhuman animal is someone and not something then it is not less wrong to violate his or her body than it is to viloate a human body.

I spoke to a vegan acquaintance about my issues with eating meat and said I was considering vegetarianism as a halfway house but would feel like a hypocrite expecting vitriol and propaganda. I got nothing but support in return  At least youre doing something to reduce the harm in the world. Come and talk to me if you need anything and Ill help. When I was thinking about changing from vegetarianism to veganism I bugged the crap out of the same acquaintance with questions about protein how much how to get it etc. I was lucky in that she was incredibly understanding and patient. She explained all the foods she uses to get protein and showed me her MFP tracker that showed she had exceeded her protein allocation daily and gave me loads of recipes to try. When I made the swap she was the first person to talk me through everything I needed to know and Ive messaged her since asking for advice on a few things. Her patience advice lack of judgement and willingness to help are one of the main reasons Im a vegan now. ,vegan,ddgs3m8,3,t5_2qhpm

10685244,0,t1_ddhzzc8,I wasnt particularly trying to have a debate about nutrition but personally Im not of the opinion that its quite that simple. We havent solved nutrition by a long shot. Obviously it is possible to be perfectly healthy as a vegan. Most of my family members are vegan. Again nothing against it. But healthy isnt a strictly black and white concept nor something that can be easily generalized for all individual humans across the board. My priority for a healthy life is variety and lack of processing. I to try to eat as many different types of foods as possible. Probably basically paleo except that I dont like labels and do like bread. Sure you could take any one individual type of food that I eat point to it and say its physically possible to not eat this so you only eat it for pleasure. I suppose that would be technically true. But Im coming from a place of starting at eat all the huge variety of foods that the planet makes available and I mean everything. I farm my own insects for food too and then cutting out anything that there is a reason to cut out. As in I need an active reason to weed things from my eat all the different foods way of doing things and because I dont find animal products to be inherently biological wrong I dont have a logical reason not to eat them. I dont see being an omnivorous animal biologically to be the same thing as support an institution that inflicts a terrible quality of daily life on animals. If I were to ever change that opinion my diet would obviously change accordingly. Thats the root of the matter and the root of my original questions. ,vegan,ddi3oyt,1,t5_2qhpm

10705402,0,t1_ddk5mbw,The thing is human interference is what has knocked everything out of balance in the first place.  In nature it works in a cycle.  Year A the prey species has lots of babies.  The predator benefits from this and also has more babies.  Year B maybe there is a drought the prey species doesnt have as many babies.  The predator species in turn has less babies.  All in all things stay overall in balance.  The wild predators wont hunt the prey into extinction because they will eventually have a food shortage and their numbers will go down.  When that happens prey numbers go up again and the cycle repeats.The problem isnt the animal populations its the human ones.  They hunt too many prey animals so the predators kill livestock.  Then they kill predators to protect livestock.  Then the prey species is more dominant and they damage crops.  So they hunt the prey that are now over populated because they killed the predators ad nauseam.  Farmers should be working on ways to more effectively protect their livestock and crops without killing the local species and knocking off the balance.  ,vegan,ddk6kvg,1,t5_2qhpm

There were only a few birds in there maybe a dozen and they werent white meat birds little red hens spent layers from one of our local freerange egg farms on their way out of state for slaughter. What really messed me up was when I noticed one hen at the back of the truck with her leg shut in the door of the cage. It was just... crushed at the joint all bruised and bloodied and purple and she just laid there stockstill and dead silent staring at me. I felt like a monster looking away and just walking past.I thought about her the entire time I was in the store it bothered me so bad thinking about how long she must have just laid there in pain how long she still had to go and what was waiting for her and her sisters when she got there. The truck was gone when I left the store. I dont know if I could have been able to drive off and leave her there if it hadnt been. I still think about that little red hen.,vegan,ddkf14j,5,t5_2qhpm

Im a personal trainer and can totally understand your concerns for calories and protein because I had them before I made the switch but I can assure you that your concerns are totally unwarranted. Most of the cheapest foods on the planet are  all plant foods that will meet your dietary goals perfectly. High protein foods like beans lentils general legumes brown rice varieties of potatoes are all high in protein and dirt cheap most places. If you are struggling to get calories you can turn to nuts and seeds. Easy source of calories as well as important fats and micronutrients. And as far as the environmental aspect of it goes it is really a nobrainer. You can bike everywhere change all your lightbulbs to ecofriendly get the low flow toilets and faucets and all the other common efforts to reduce impact. But all that combined cant get you close to the positive impact a vegan has just by refraining from supporting animal agriculture. Animal agriculture as an entire process is the greatest single contributor to green house gases by a good chunk. Check out some of the documentaries others listed as good resources on the matter.

Its not like the world is divided into vegan health nuts and omni gluttons shoving their faces with cheeseburgers. For some people with limited resources taking care of their health means not being a perfect vegan. If vegans werent so focused on gatekeeping purity tests and questioning peoples lived experiences then maybe more people would understand that veganism is about doing ones personal best and stop feeling so discouraged by veganism. The part about lactose intolerance really makes me wonder if OP understands institutional racism at all or if theyre just using it as a gotcha card against those meddling SJWs.

But after getting a degree in ecology I had change my view based on what Id learned. Its a case of the road to hell being paved with good intentionsour planets ecosystems are really suffering for lots of reasons and invasive species are a major factor. Nature is brutal and practically speaking a dying from a virus probably isnt a whole lot worse than how a rabbit in the wild would die naturally. Wild animals do not have the luxury of being euthanized after living our their lifespan like our pets dothey either get eaten by a predator starve get sick die of exposure exhaustion etc its INCREDIBLY rare for a wild animal to just die of old age. Obviously I dont think that the inherent brutality of nature is a justification to slaughter wildlife for shits and giggles but in cases where its truly necessary to cull a population realistically they are not going to suffer much more than they would have naturally. In a lot of cases they probably suffer significantly less think surprise bullet vs. prolonged starvation that ends with being too weak to escape a predator.  gt Veganism is a way of living that seeks to exclude as far as possible and practicable all forms of exploitation of and cruelty to animals for food clothing and any other purpose.I actually really dislike the vegan label because of all of the ridiculous infighting it seems to cause but by this definition I think ecological health squarely fits within as far as possible and practicable,vegan,ddxm3dr,5,t5_2qhpm

10891649,0,t1_de2ma7i,gtand thus are trying to make me defend that at all times killing an animal is as morally reprehensible as killing a humanuh oh i see a straw man. no im not saying anything about whether the life of a nonhuman animal is necessarily equal in moral worth to a human animal. you seem to be scurrying away from the point here which is regardless of whether you think a human has more moral weight than a cow this does not then justify condoning the unnecessary death of a cow granted you would oppose the unnecessary death of a human. The reason this has to be true is because of basic logical consistency. If you oppose the death of one creature on the basis of sentience which almost everybody does then it is a double standard to not apply that same opposition to other sentient animals. For example while I may very well value the life of a mentally retarded toddler less than a fully developed and intelligent human that does not mean that I am okay with the toddler being unnecessarily killed. ,vegan,de3ea1q,1,t5_2qhpm

Thats just how nature works. You have kg of plants these will get you just roughly kg meat.In the end each acre of productive land thats used for animal feeding could instead provide for a multiple of the resulting food if it were used for vegan purposes.  times more is probably a bit optimistic since you have to look at other factors like nutritional value as well and Im not an expert but I think the point is clear.This is probably also a reason why some vegans seem to be missionizing more than others  to many its not just a food preference but a way to actually tackle world hunger. ,vegan,de3so6m,1,t5_2qhpm

10924921,0,t1_de6hjv6,There is no such thing as cholesterol. The IUPAC name is actually cholestenol. You must only use cholestenol when referring to this organic molecule.See how annoying it is when people are overly pedantic without really contributing very much? Context matters. Its kind of a nobrainer that we have all been conditioned to think good cholesterol  HDL and bad cholesterol  LDL which is a simplified way to present the lipid hypothesis to layman masses. But yes your wikipedia page explains this alreadygtThis atherosclerotic disease process over decades leads to myocardial infarction heart attack stroke and peripheral vascular disease. Since higher blood LDL especially higher LDL particle concentrations and smaller LDL particle size contribute to this process more than the cholesterol content of the HDL particles LDL particles are often termed bad cholesterol because they have been linked to atheroma formation. On the other hand high concentrations of functional HDL which can remove cholesterol from cells and atheroma offer protection and are sometimes referred to as good cholesterol. These balances are mostly genetically determined but can be changed by body build medications food choices and other factors.HUH. So HDL and LDL appear to have rather opposite effects on our arterial endothelial cells and plaque formation. Seems like it is perfectly acceptable common usage to refer to one as good and one as bad just like it is acceptable common usage to simply say cholesterol.,vegan,de6tv9n,11,t5_2qhpm

Veganism is the focus because it relieves more suffering in general on top of animal agriculture being the biggest engine of suffering that exists gt billion land animals a year and is actually practical for the vast majority of people. Definition of veganism from the sidebar Veganism is a way of living that seeks to exclude as far as possible and practicable all forms of exploitation of and cruelty to animals for food clothing and any other purpose.,vegan,de7jam5,21,t5_2qhpm

Thats the stuff thats easy to get at and requires the least processing just cutting apart and this is what used to be sausage.Never mind wild game has to bled out aged to be as edible as the messed up very young tender and hence undeveloped animals that come off farms. It needs to undergo a kind cell death so the degeneration of the flesh starts and it becomes grey meaning its tender now.Other than that youd have to BBQmincebraise it for it to be very good.If you were making deer sausageBBQ youd need piles of meat and wouldnt be able to eat it by your lonesome anyhow.,vegan,deetda7,3,t5_2qhpm

The industry is built on demand not the other way around. edit its really frustrating to see people have this point of view and its a good part of why people see this as an evil lifestyle and thus pushes them away from even opening their minds to the concept. i hate seeing people eat meat but I also understand its how they were raised and how their ancestors were raised dating back thousands of years. The industry just grew to produce supply. Our doctors and pharmaceutical companies are just doing what they can to keep people alive with the choices theyre making. a doctor is a doctor not a philosopher. not his duty to lecture us on ethics.

I got so much shit from friends and family and keto diets were just coming into fashion. Quit being vegan did keto lost  pounds and gained it back. Still loved the ethics of veganism but I was convinced I could never lose weight on a vegan diet. Finally thought Im fat either way so I might as well not be eating animals. Now Im trying HCLF and its working so far. I knew veganism was right I just thought I could ignore my conscience. Feels good to be back.,vegan,dek2jr3,26,t5_2qhpm

11059245,0,t3_5xvns9,I understand that even when youre vegan you have to live in the real world. That said I really believe you could make it as an entirely vegan cafe whether you promote it as vegan or not.You used euro for your prices but I figure it cant be that much different from what the US enforces. At least in the states milk is complicated to sell. You have to follow different regulations with dairy because its very easy to transmit disease through it it breeds bacteria and rots faster than nondairy milks. I recall being employed at a place that had the permit to sell milkshakes and ice cream with dairy milk in them but they were not allowed to sell just a plain glass of milk.Heres a quote from the FDAgt...milk has a potential to serve as a vehicle of disease transmission and has in the past been associated with disease outbreaks of major proportions. gtThe incidence  of  milkborne illness in the United States has been sharply  reduced. In  milkborne outbreaks constituted twentyfive percent  of  all disease outbreaks due to infected foods and contaminated water.  Nondairy has a better shelf life you dont even have to refrigerate some of them. It would last you longer than dairy.Now morally I think you could still do a lot of good with a  vegan bakery even if it is secretly vegan. Especially if you introduce people to how much better the plant milks are for them than dairy. Best of luck whatever you decide to do.,vegan,deljpts,2,t5_2qhpm

11060757,0,t3_5xvp44,Some people are vegan for environmental reasons some for animal rights and ethical reasons some for health. Some people will never care about the environment that lasts after they die and some people will never feel the type of empathy most of us feel for any nonpet animals. The environmental and health reasonings for veganism might leave some people that it is ok for some meat consumption like you said but the most animal lives impacted reasoning you are pushing also has flaws. Even if we dont want to admit it we each have a hierarchical system of how we view sentience. If you truly believe all things are equal we need to be talking about driving cars at speeds that kill bugs and the booming cricket protein powder industry. Because humans kill bugs by the billions as well. Its not that I want these crickets to die nor do I want people to replace their red meat consumption with chickens but I know I would rather have a bug die before a chicken and a chicken die before a pig.         What I want is for people to understand that veganism can benefit health the environment and lessen suffering. Steps toward veganism including reducing meat consumption and moving towards ethical meat nonfactory farmed are good steps and indicators that people are becoming more aware of where their food comes from and its impact on the planet and animals. Which might make them more susceptible to vegnism in the future.,vegan,delpw1l,5,t5_2qhpm

Thank you for this!Do you have any thoughts on how to actually advocate this in practice? I mean if I were talking to my friend and got her to understand that animals arent here to be exploited by us but she still wanted to keep on practicing the same diet what could I say? Would it be something like Reducing consumption and looking for more ethical options is always better than not changing but I hope one day you understand that its still exploiting animals and choose to be vegan.  Something like that? I guess Im just trying to balance in my head how you can advocate for veganism without any confusion but still support flexitarianwelfare?

11112711,0,t1_derlw4u,The body has adapted to be pretty damn good at surviving on nearly any ratio of natural foods excluding anything processed by man without dying but we can use science! and observational studies to be even better than the natural diet. Hell people can live to  years old being  pounds  thats a pretty huge feat of survival right there. Many people stayed alive as near skeletons in the Holocaust. Its relatively difficult to kill yourself quickly weeks months years with only food. But inadequate too little calories or too little nutrients food over a long time period is pretty reliable at killing people a decade or three earlier than they couldve with best nutrition. The body when given natural aka unrefined no sugar added no fiber removed etc does a pretty fantastic job at keeping you pretty healthy and notdead except in extreme cases.

For example if you have cheese on everything you eat drink milk at all meals and have lots of eggs you could be harming more animals than a meat eater who just eats meat once a day. But in reality Im sure thats not usually the case. I think vegetarians generally eat close to the same amount of milk cheese and eggs as meat eaters and just cut out meat. Anyways I think its good when people go vegetarian because it could be a stepping stone to veganism and it shows that they care about animals usually. ,vegan,dezlbs7,9,t5_2qhpm

I would encourage you to try to keep track for at least a week or even just a day just to recalibrate your intuitions regarding how many calories youre actually eating. I especially think this is true since youre talking about eating a lot of veggies but its extremely difficult to get  or even  from vegetables alone without exploding from such a high fiber intake.

Put it this way  if you have a  bill in your wallet someone steals it but you never notice have you been exploited? Id argue yes  the fact that you dont know it doesnt mean the thief hasnt gotten full use amp benefit what I mean by exploit here from your  something that was not his to decide what to do with. Similar with cruelty. Commercial beehives for instance often have queens whose wings have been intentionally clipped to keep them from flying away. Even if we assume that the queen bee feels no pain and doesnt mind not being able to leave the hive isnt the act of clipping the body of a living thing for personal gain a cruel act from the human side of the equation?,vegan,dfognsw,5,t5_2qhpm

Wellplanned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle including pregnancy lactation infancy childhood and adolescence and for athletes Source So you give  reasons here as to what contends with animal suffering and death. Proper nutrients  you can get all the nutrients you need as a vegan see above.. Culture  culture is not an excuse for immoral behaviour take for instance sati where women in India were expected and sometimes forced to burn themselves to death after their husband died.

If I can get through a headache with some tea or a sports injury with some compresses it feels weird to mess with my bodys natural response. Obviously Ive never stared death in the face maybe a selfpreservation instinct would surface maybe Id want to live my life too badly but Id like to think that I would stick to my moral code that my life is no more goodworthyvaluable than that of the animals that would have to suffer for me to have such and such a pill.

11503752,0,t1_dfzxs5n,It does seem daft. But I get it. Atheist vegan feminist whatever of course it makes sense not to want to associate with a label that a portion of society dislikes. Doesnt necessarily reflect a problem with that group more likely it reflects being a sensitive person who doesnt want conflict in their life doesnt want to take sides in an argument that will get vitriol leveled at them. So heres what I see you have vegetarian friends you became veg.And thats the norm.So the question is how do we get more people with veg friends? You gotta start somewhere. People like you cant be influenced by logic or reason. People like me can. I went vegan when literally no one around me was vegan or vegetarian. I had no friends who were vegan or vegetarian. And I went vegan mostly from having my logical arguments challenged by outspoken vegans.There is always a small minority of people on the leading edge of moral issues who are willing to step out of their comfort zone and go where logic takes them even if it leads them to having to change their life in a major way and challenge norms of their family friends and society.My opinion is that when it comes to anonymous internet arguments literally no one can be persuaded except these people. So we shouldnt be targeting people like you who will only convert if their friends already feel a certain way. We should be targeting people like me and maybe like whomever converted your friends.We cant just give vegetarian friends to strangers on Reddit. We can only give them arguments. And while you are right that some people will roll into a ball when approached by those arguments that minority will try to fight back will use logic to defend their views and can actually accept when their logic is wrong and try again with a new tactic. TLDR I doubt the relevant point is that the arguments that converted you were gentle and not forced I suspect the relevant point is that it was your personal reallife friends presenting the case. Thus I dont find your conversion story relevant to how the issue should be approached online.,vegan,dfzy8cr,2,t5_2qhpm

By merely realizing that you are indeed thinking that can put a stop to harmful neurotic mental chatter that causes stuff like anxiety. Try it. Do you hear a voice in your head narrating your life?

So many people go too fast into a new diet they change too much too quickly then when they get into some difficulty they fall all the way back on their old diet because they just did it in one jump so dont feel like you need to change  right this moment aim to transition gradually in small steps all while being supportive of your body and dont be afraid to kick back a bit if youre having cravings or anything like that.

This is because of the impression it gives to other people. By eating meat you confuse veganism in the eyes of other people and create a set of potentially complicated conditions to be a vegan. By just saying Im a vegan and I dont eat animal products you keep it simple for people.

11635598,0,t1_dgc2m07,I do agree that other arguments against carnism like environment and ethics clearly are more meaningful.However I dont think that it is justified to completely dismiss other arguments without being able to properly refute them.After watching the Are humans designed to eat meat? presentation from Dr. Milton Mills I have enough ammunition to defend my believe of humans being suited rather badly for the consumption of other animals.So about your beans and potatoes point I agree. The human physiology is not suited to eat them right away.But how does naming more things humans are badly equipped to eat answer or refute any of the points I raised before?Does being unable to eat raw potatoes make us any better at barehandedly killing a cow?Are there not still a myriad of plants we can consume without depending on any of the tools or methods we first needed to invent?In my opinion we are omnivores only because our brain allowed us to invent workarounds allowing us to tap into that additional foodsource despite our otherwise unsuitable physiology.That is in no way meant weaken any of the other arguments as for why sticking to plants as food source is the better decision.Quite the opposite For me it is yet another argument convincing me about doing the right thing.,vegan,dgewoyw,2,t5_2qhpm

11736209,0,t1_dgq4qe9,If I can butt in here I dont disagree with your first point  sexual attraction is driven primarily by reproductive fitness and since women bear most of the reproductive burden it makes since that that will take a greater toll on them than on men and theyll be less attractive as they age  but I would ask why does it matter? It seems like you wrote that unprovoked. In my opinion you should simply go for who youre attracted to and not worry about what everyone else is doing with their love life.Years ago I was a TRPer and I think theres a sliver of good advice there revolving around men not being ashamed of their sexuality. But those tidbits are drowned out by all the rampant unsourced sexism and I think its a toxic environment that will teach you to hate women rather than appreciate them. Personally Id stay away. In fact now that I think about it Id say its pretty much the opposite of veganism which fosters compassion for anyone who can suffer despite any apparent differences.Also while Im here please check your noun consistencygtYoure in or past your mid s which as a female means you are way past your peak sexual market value so in your case men in their s are a higher sexual market value than youMalefemale are adjectives while menwomen are nouns.

11746002,0,t3_67ltxr,I cant remember the exact details but when I was considering it as a vegetarian I looked it up and found out that garden henseggs arent as harmless as it sounds. Youre going to have to do your own research into this but from what I remember there were a few problems with backyard hens Firstly youre buying the chickens from a company that is selling to the public. So they are breeding hens for the purpose of making a profit and are most likely also selling the eggs. That first step contributes to the industry and the harm. Most possibly all? breeds of chickens will fill their empty nest. If you take the eggs they laid today they will produce more eggs a lot quicker than normal to fill the nest. Producing eggs at such a fast pace will put so much strain on their body and make their life a lot shorter than it should be. Laying eggs takes a lot out of chickens. Hens sometimes eat their own eggs for the nutrients they provide to survive. If youre taking the eggs theyre producing them a lot quicker and cant even replenish the nutrients because the unfertilised eggs are gone. Theres a lot more information out there if you do a quick google search. ,vegan,dgrftac,4,t5_2qhpm

11781402,0,t3_67ypm3,I think that the easiest order is . Meat. Meat is usually only in savory dishes and its relatively easy to get some sort of vegetarian option usually something cheesy. Eggs. Eggs arent usually going to be in savory options unless theyre for breakfast items and things like cheesecake are lacto vegetarian. Theyre also a bit less likely to be found in random packaged goods.. Dairy. I think dairy is probably the hardest. A lot of restaurant vegetables are cooked in butter almost all desserts that youll find in a restaurant have dairy in them its in a lot of packaged foods and cheese is extremely addictive. However dairy substitutes usually taste better than meat and egg substitutes although Im a huge fan of vegan chicken sandwiches dairy is usually not necessary for desserts that you make at home and the world is not lacking in cheese substitutes. Some of the really good ones are. Daiya. They are the cheese substitute youre most likely to find at your local grocer and they make all sorts of stuff. Provolone mozzarella pepperoni pizza cheesecake..... etc. Theyre also free of pretty much all of the major allergens.. Treeline. They make a lot of artisan vegan cheeses.

11796431,0,t1_dgwv0bs,Because its literally a KKK slogan. Its not wrong but context is important. There are so many words and phrases we can use to advocate for animals we really dont have to go there. Black lives matter is meant to highlight the fact that black lives are being treated like they dont matter not that they matter more. All lives matter is being used by racist groups to undermine and work against that message and its not something we should be associating with. ,vegan,dgx5z24,18,t5_2qhpm

11801476,0,t1_dgxqi8q,Heres a study where they taught slime molds painful stimuli and the slime molds learned from it an adapted their behavior Does it have a will to be free from pain and a will to live? Do slime molds deserve as much protection from us as cows?Sentience is just a category not a moral imperative. I see suffering as the moral imperative. And insects dont suffer.,vegan,dgxql4m,1,t5_2qhpm
11803884,0,t3_68fbca,gt  Is it better to you if someone would eat a dog and a chicken?Not really. Dont you think being consistent in your actions is only better if you are consistently non violent or working toward decreasing suffering? If your being consistent means more death and suffering Id rather you stay inconsistent.In the end thinking that animals in general are there for you to slaughter on a whim is still very much speciesism. Otherwise you would be ok with doing the same thing to a human with similar capacities as the animals you are ok to kill. If you are ok to kill everyone regardless of their species including humans then you arent a speciesist. But as I pointed above it would suck.,vegan,dgy0ew7,9,t5_2qhpm
