94734,0,t1_cep7289,I played a bit of UTk around the time that UT came out and the major turnoff for me was the insanely nerfed movement system. I dont recall the specifics but I think they had removed dodge  jumping entirely and just left dodges in place. The game ended up just feeling a lot slower overall and that was generally uninteresting. I dont know if they managed to correct that  didnt stick around long enough.

3539139,0,t3_30jlwz,gtShould I be using a similar sensitive to my sensitivity in other fps?Yes. You want the muscle memory youve already developed to transfer over.  is pretty low so Id say youre okay. Id put the optimal sensitivity range at CM  or .gtSecondly are there any fundamental thought processes that I should be considering that differ arena fps from standard military fps?Rocket spam rails and yomi. Yomi is the situations where I know youre going to do X so I counter with Y layer one. You know Im going to counter with Y so you do Z layer . I know youre going to do Z because you know I want to do Y so I do something else entirely and were back at square one layer . The application of this is in rockets and rails. If I know you are going to take a certain path or cross a certain angle I will find a lowrisk position to damage you from with that information by spamming rockets in your path and then hiding to break LOS letting the projectile do the work or Ill stand there and poke you with the railgun. You have to leverage your stack health and armor vs your risk and reward. You shouldnt peek an angle and try to make a godlike rail if youre low enough lt to get hit by a return rail whereas in CS even at HP you can try the AWP shot  its much more binary. The entire match you have to be carefully considering the riskreward of each action based on what information position and items your opponents has. gtAnd finally how do I actively pursue getting better?Play with people better than you. Ask questions. Make sure your config is set up correctly and dont constantly make drastic tweaks to throw off your learning. Remember that this is a skill game and anything not going your way is entirely your fault not the games excluding the odd bug instance but these are not gamebreaking. Play lots of arena or FFA  anything to even the playing field. You wont learn much by constantly playing people who  you in duels you need to play people near your skill level as well to learn the maps instead of how to hide from the train that is an experienced opponent in duel. Learn the situations where you want to be using each weapon Rockets to spam cornersclose range fights where theyre easy to land Bolt Rifle for midlong range pokes and low risk fireandhide plays Ion Cannon for punishing anyone running straight at you finishing people who are low Grenades to arc over ledges and bank around corners etc.And finally...LEARN THE MOVEMENTYour ability to move will make or break games. You should already know how to bunnyhopairstrafe from CS but you ABSOLUTELY MUST learn how to Circle Jump and Strafe Jump or other players will run circles around you. Air strafing CS movement only helps you to steer around corners and evade midair circle jumping and strafe jumping is what will bring you all of your speed. Rip around the common maps by yourself and practice some movement routes once youve got the basics down. Any trick jumps you can find and execute consistently is hugely beneficial. Double jumps triple jumps tele jumps wall running and stair jumps can all come later.,reflex,cpvon9f,2,t5_2slv4

4156642,0,t3_3898j3,Try FFA until you get things like weapon switching and basic combos like rocket gt rail down and when to use each weapon.When you want to duel go around maps you want to try first and see how to get between the items and if theres short cuts you can make with teleporter and double jumps and whatnot. If youre in control you want to just hoover up megaRA and chase people down and if youre out of control try to steal while going for junk like yellow armor and make the other guy pay with grenades and sniping whenever you can get free damage in.Also try to find people who will stomp you without completely annihilating you. Painful but youll learn a massive amount about reading people dodging and how to really abuse weapons than you would by twitching around with someone else whos just starting out.Also raise your sensitivity from cs or use accel or taste the pain. Theres a sweet point between moving around comfortably freely and being able to aim that you need to find with cm probably being where most people fall. Also depends on if you aim with your wrist or your arm.,reflex,cru2ht5,2,t5_2slv4

6082530,0,t1_cygv3yp,Hmm not sure if I can answer the first one entirely but i think its a gameplay design choice you should be shooting from the center of your vision. The game is not trying to be a realistic shooter at all but it is going for what functions best as an fps shooter at heart.The second is just the way the netcode works. The netcode gets a lot of high praise for a very good reason. heres a link to an explanation of it  but basically.. erm... its complicated XD ... something like youre telling the server what you want to happen and the server accounting for everyones ping differences then tells u what it calculated to really happen taking into account the information it gave u and others previously and how all players see their situation to be and not just taking data at face value... man just try read the link I hope Im not confusing the issue more sedit For me rocket jumps feel good but to work it well you must prefire the rocket before your jump to compensate for the two things in play  the rocket appearing from center of the player and the netcode where rockets dont appear until the server says theyve appeared.,reflex,cygwgih,1,t5_2slv4
