5749132,0,t3_3tvagu,Im fairly new to wet builds just unlocked yesterday but do the pumps that arent touching generators or pipes do much?  Can they transmit through other pumps?,ReactorIdle,cx9qhyr,1,t5_3ailg

5940685,0,t3_3w7rse,when you first get a higher power station thing its HARDLY going to turn a profit.  i was first playing with nukes and realized the replacement cost of the unit was  of the money it generated.  fuck.  so now i try to not jump to the next higher power unit as long as possible.  you mostly just switch power units when your current one gets stupid expensive.  oh  million to upgrade nuclear but .trillion to upgrade my gas plants?  FUCK THAT.  an exagerated example but you get it.  also i try not to do more than  lifetime upgrades per tech since those are non refundable,ReactorIdle,cxycr7l,1,t5_3ailg
6061638,0,t1_cyd5een,Thanks for offering help. Unfortunately the realization of how wasteful Im being with my time has already dawned.  Im a lost case and it cant be helped. But thanks anyway ,ReactorIdle,cye6aoe,1,t5_3ailg
6211314,0,t3_40na7v,Stealing from uArgosy gtWth gen  you really cant run a build with only one groundwater pump per  gens anymore like you could with gen. Look at your upgrade costs  your next GWP upgrade is more than x that of your gen max water.  gwp to gen builds such as these become the only viable choice even if theyre .Also with that kind of setup I would recommend for your water elem to be equal to your pump   So  GWP means  Water elem,ReactorIdle,cyvnr13,2,t5_3ailg
6305391,0,t1_cz6ck1d,Nice. This is what my upgrades look like. I tried to optimize them as much as possible but I had to overlevel Gen max water by  to prevent generators near the outlets from retaining heat. At least I dont need to upgrade gen max heat anymore.,ReactorIdle,cz6coro,2,t5_3ailg

6565332,0,t1_czyeohv,ISO  GWP  GMW  Pro  Water Element Looks like only the ISO are higher I have Gen Effect on  I have no idea if its worth using this at this stage of the game. Also Im using normal pumps on the edges of the map instead of pipes as they act like pipes but can produce water lvl .,ReactorIdle,czyerg9,1,t5_3ailg
10274274,0,t3_5n472g,I dont remember the exact ratio of bonus ticks but they sure arent better than running the game. Only advantage is youll be able to buy things midnight with bonus ticks but this hardly an important advantage.Also make sure to leave the game in a foreground tab as it does not compensate for browsers slowdown for background tabs.,ReactorIdle,dc8n7w7,2,t5_3ailg
