Then Dot Arena was released in Asia by Lilith Games based on DotA Arena. Lilith rebranded the game Soul Charge for an american market but Heroes Charge took the Asian Game redid the art and published it first. Lilith rebranded Soul Charge to Soul Hunters and sued the creators of Heroes Charge.Then there was some trouble about art assets taken from DotA Arena from Blizzard which is why we have some similar heroes with different art and names now Alana Garrick Gale Elric.,SoulHuntersGame,d44wd5v,1,t5_37qfj

8035471,0,t1_d4j83l9,They start new servers and merge older servers really frequently I think. I started playing about a month ago and  was new back then.I think one problem with the game is that you gain such a huge advantage simply by being one of the first few players on a new server. Everyone levels at roughly the same rate unless you spend a crazy amount of diamonds on stamina so you can dominate arena simply by being one of the first few players on a new server and being a level or two above everyone else.,SoulHuntersGame,d4j9gdz,1,t5_37qfj

9812164,0,t1_dalutd8,Both especially with the meta changes of Zem and the addition of Taurus. Taurus buffing up the magic damage of Lumos means more damage distribution plus Taurus already great attacks and skills means the whole team gets wrecked. Lumos linked to Zem means a win generally  of the time and if not then it will be a uphill battle.In def battles Lumos being paired with either Garrick or Xanos in any comp means longer endurance. The more they survive the more they do more damage to the whole team. Not to mention that Lumos lifelink also provides damage reduction and haste.Same can be said for the offensive. If you have a all frontline team comp Lumos can be used also as disruption. Ex. Lumos lifelink bond with Tanya or Xanos goes in the middle of the enemy formation and ults stuns surrounding enemies and Zem will tear through them with Taurus doing his spin AoE. Lumos is just too Versatile as a support unit in my opinion. Everyone in my server uses him in Def line ups and over  of the battles I defended were attacked with LumosZemXanosXX. Also did a server merge and same results Lumos is almost everywhere in the top  ranks.,SoulHuntersGame,damk56o,1,t5_37qfj
