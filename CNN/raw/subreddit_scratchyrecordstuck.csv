7775117,0,t1_d3pxr6k,I could claim that one of the dead players has admitted to reviving you. Not sure if its any less risky than saying I did it though. And it is SUPER risky for me to defend you.We also might get lucky and someone else tried reviving you the same night making this whole thing moot.EDIT scratch that Im the only one who could have. I gave night actions for the dead already and the other two have claimed not. So... I dont know if I should claim or not ,scratchyrecordstuck,d3pyuo5,1,t5_3ej9b
