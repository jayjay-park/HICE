That being said ur lead sounds good but dont be afraid to add more effects to it to flesh it out even more. And as for what triplets are its when three notes hit one after the other in a pattern heres a link to a pic of what I mean so you can get the idea.  And keep it up man.,riddim,crfrkrf,2,t5_2ulr0

And I know what you mean about being a perfectionist lol I watched an interview with datsik one time and he talked about just finding a sound you like and just Rollin with it instead fussing too much with the sounds or youll get stuck. I always think of this when Im feeling fussy lol,riddim,d2r3rf2,1,t5_2ulr0
