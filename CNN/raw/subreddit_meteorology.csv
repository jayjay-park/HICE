3901347,0,t3_351o55,I dont know much about this topic but my best guess would be that it has to do with the light scattering. Most likely Mie scattering which is responsible for the white color of the clouds. ,meteorology,cr0zkqv,1,t5_2sa51
4109048,0,t1_crokc3q,So the leading edge is where all of the upwards motion takes place warm moist air is sucked into the storm ahead of the storm fueling the convection. Just behind this leading edge cooler drier air returns back to the ground downdraft. This downdraft can cause much of the damage in the storm as the cooled air returns to earth with a lot of force. The yellow area behind the leading edge is most likely stratiform precipitation a mostly uniform area of precip that grows horizontally. It engulfs other storms because the strength of those storms updrafts are overcome by the squall and the squall basically steals their energy and fuel source warm moist air.

7356258,0,t3_4g3xny,Studying wavelengthslight is huge in Meteorology. You deal a lot with kineticpotential energy once you get into the Physical Meteorology course. It is also a fairly good chunk of thermodynamics when it comes to Newtons laws of motionequations of state etc. Its not a big deal if you get through physics and you dont have these concepts nailed because much of those classes go into these concepts all over again. I know that when I took physics almost nothing in the labs was useful and we had to learn about circuits also useless. Its much more useful to nail the calculus courses. ,meteorology,d2ecu0l,3,t5_2sa51
7511835,0,t1_d2vw0xs,gtEDIT Actually this escaped me but we now have . petaflops of supercomputing powerYep Luna and Surge. Been a relatively quiet rollout so far but all the NWS models are transitioning to them right now and all model upgrades should start occurring on the Cray later this year. Looking forward to seeing what the Cray will give EMC the ability to do. Would be nice to get the GFS at or below km horizontal resolution although doubling the vertical resolution seems to be more worthwhile to do first.,meteorology,d2w23w4,2,t5_2sa51

8398205,0,t3_4sqlh0,One thing I did was retake classes even if I passed them if I felt I didnt understand them well enough to continue forward. Now tuition is much cheaper up here in the land of ice and snow but it went a LONG way for me particularly retaking vector calc. The actual grade I got didnt matter it was based on how I felt.And for the program I did the math was nearly as if not more important than the physics. Thermodynamics was key of course and fluid mechanics would have been helpful as it was I did oceanography which did cover a lot of the basics. The question is.. are you bad at physics bad at math or bad at certain aspects of physics. Because I tell you certain classes I passed on pure hope and guessing quantum.....If you havent been visiting your profs and TAs start doing that. I spent a lot of time with some of my profs because my brain would go left when the subject would go right. It didnt take long to get on the right path but it would have been hard to find it on my own. Office hours exist for a reason DIf you feel like you can get pretty good at thermodynamics fluids and multivariable calculus then I think youre still on a decent path towards meteorology. I was never an A student. Heck I was often happy with a B. Grades arent everything However if you really arent sure if its for you theres also the path my brother took which has worked out well for him. He wasnt sure what he wanted to do in uni so he did a  month trade automotive tech in his case. He worked at that for a while earning a decent wage and had a skill that would never go to waste. Then he went and did archaeology. If you need to time to think about it this is a decent route as well.,meteorology,d5rbm0f,1,t5_2sa51
8409746,0,t3_4uok8l,Phenomena like this fall under the blanket term of megacryometeors They are pretty rare but not as rare as you would think given how many presumably go unreported by falling where no human notices them before they melt. Heres a local news story about one in  and heres another horriblywritten story about an incident in .There are lots of theories as to what causes them but odds are there are multiple different phenomena behind the occurrences.  The most obvious and likely is chunks of ice falling from airplanes. But there were many recorded instances in history prior to the widespread adoption of airplanes so there must be some other phenomenon at play too.  It is possible that some are extraterrestrial in nature comets or fragments of comets that somehow manage to fall to Earth intact. Hoaxes andor pranks undoubtedly account for at least some of the instances. Its possible that there is some unknown atmospheric phenomenon at play. Heres one specific study that did isotopic analysis on the water from some recovered megacryometeors in India. They found that they all consistently had the same isotopic composition as local rainwater and found no other evidence to indicate they were from an extraterrestrial origin. So either they were the product of an unusual collection of freshwater ice on an airplane that became dislodged some unknown atmospheric phenomenon or an elaborate hoax. The same conclusion was reached by researchers in Spain PDF after a similar event in January . Maybe some other unknown phenomenon,meteorology,d5srh9r,2,t5_2sa51

10422057,0,t3_5p8a44,Penn State alum here we focus pretty heavily on the science aspect but have fabulous opportunities for you to get in front of the camera. Several student produced shows made on a weekly basis give you the opportunity to learn to make graphics do behind the scenes stuff as well as get in front of the camera in multiple ways which is HUGE when youre starting out in the industry. We also have student run clubs you can do it on a less serious level. Theres also a wide variety of faculty so you can specialize in forecasting and communication and really tailor your skills. Admittedly you do have a ton of science and math but you come out with a really well rounded education and can be extremely marketable.,meteorology,dcpeqyc,2,t5_2sa51

11158330,0,t3_5z31ps,You should be able to make a gif with weatherscope. As for your question it could be due to a lot of reasons. The returns indicate that there are convective transient features which may behave different than the system as a whole. For example some convection moves in the direction of the mean vertical winds. The area you highlighted may have convection that has a different vertical structure than the surrounding snow squalls. If the vertical structures are different they can move in different directions. This can happen often during summer time thunderstorms. Also if I were to truly give you a good reason Id have to see some high res models different levels of the atmosphere wind profiles etc.,meteorology,dews9er,1,t5_2sa51
