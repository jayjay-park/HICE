Secondly the gameplay looks really dull and simple. Just some spikes and jumps. Try to mix it up more jump rings and gravity portals. Thirdly the decorations are outdated and there are too few. Try to mix stuff together and move some stuff around with the move triggers.Im no expert either but I like to think Ive got the basics down. Watch Triaxis creator school on youtube or other tutorial vids for help.Making a good level is really hard nowadays and it will get more complicated with each update. Try to keep up.

Dying when hitting an upside down bounce pad should only happen the wave is right side up because it cant bounce off the pad while moving the opposite way i.e. wave goes upward in normal gravity while attempting to hit an upside down bounce pad nothing happens. Wave goes up due to upside down gravity hits the upside down pad goes downward. This applies to all modes. ii. If Tosh had released instead of clicking quickly he most likely would have died.

Its always annoying when a level got way too many elements and everything starts to bug out. And the problem with inconsistencies in difficulty are also a problem.
