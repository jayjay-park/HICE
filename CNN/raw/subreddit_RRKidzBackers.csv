1142731,0,t3_26wc1d,One that has always stuck with me is Out of the Dust by Karen Hesse. My grandpa gave it to me and ever sense I bring it up from time to time I dont even have that copy from when I was a kid anymore. I tend to like series stories because I hate books to end but Out of the Dust holds a really special place with me. ,RRKidzBackers,chy62x4,2,t5_31znd
