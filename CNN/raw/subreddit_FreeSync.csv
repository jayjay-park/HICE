5293747,0,t1_cvo3dsk,Yes one monitor can be freesync while the other one is not. Thats what I have setup right now. ,FreeSync,cvoc648,4,t5_37bmn
7906318,0,t1_d3ywfki,so it does not happen when my Monitor comes out of standby but I noticed that switching the resolution does not cause it either. Freesync is not active on boot. At this point I would not be surprised if there are issues with the current driver. When Crimson first came out it caused a lot of problems with freesync even at stock range and I had to roll back.,FreeSync,d44qude,1,t5_37bmn
8400304,0,t3_4r773m,hz monitor is great to have. But youll need a powerful enough graphics card to drive that refresh rate. If you stay below hz its not the end of the world .. youll still have a better experience than hz. Its totally worth it if your graphics card achieves well above  fps.Edit spelling mistake corrected,FreeSync,d5rl1qn,1,t5_37bmn
9059518,0,t1_d80mz4r,Im loving it so far. Its been a long time since Ive had a monitor this bright or colors this good. I set Windows scaling to  and it seems to be reasonable. Id be happy with it at  but My wife would probably kill me. I have particularly good eyes and still see pixels. LOL.This is the closest Ive seen a screen look like Im reading something printed on paper.,FreeSync,d80t49j,1,t5_37bmn
