270252,1,t1_cf8rd4d,gtYoure turning it from a positive symbol from a negative one.Pretty sure its still being used as a positive one. gtYoure taking a sacred item and exploiting it so you can have fun.Im not taking your sacred item. I made my own. Youre just jealous coz its cooler. gtLets not kid ourselves. Youre wearing a headdress no matter how many flourescent feathers you put it in.Thats just how you see it. How much do I have to change it before its no longer your sacred item? Is a hat a headdress? Surely theres a continuous scale between a baseball cap and a headdress. At which point is it sacred?gtGo on excuse my perspective.Im not excusingdismissing it. Im taking it into consideration and have decided youre being too sensitive. Im taking it into consideration when I say Id never wear a straight up traditional headdress. Im taking it into consideration when Im not mocking your culture. Im not pissing on a traditional headdress in front of you. Im wearing something similar to you and youre getting offended. The westboro baptist church is offended by gay people. But gays believe dont give a shit because they think their cause is just and the people being offended are stupid. This is a less extreme version of that. I hear you...but I think youre being stupid. gtHmm Muslim women have pretty cool head scarfs...Truth.I think it boils down to youre too worried about other people doing what they want. No one is trying to tell you what to do or wear. Youre trying to do that. Your traditional headdress is yours and no one elses. No one can take that away from you. Let others do what they want and appreciate that no one is trying to dictate what you do too. ,ElectricForest,cf8rsqt,0,t5_2sdfx

312377,0,t3_1xl6ba,Listening to this album was a much more enjoyable listen for me on the second run than the first and Im less disappointed.Love Death Immortality starts really strong. Mind of a Beast comes out swinging hard and has great synergy with the following track Our Demons. Fly By Night Only which I dont see a lot of people talking about is a really great effort and possibly my favorite on the album. An excellent swing carries you through the track and the playful energy between the vocalist and the synths get me moving. I listened to that one a second time after my second play though!There are moments of Skullclub and Skytoucher later in the album that I find myself waiting for the end of. Theyre too comfortably assigned away into electronic music filler Ive heard before on more than one album by another artist. For the same reason the cliched lyric Youve got me out of control repeating over and over in I Need My Memory Back does not work for me as a build up. It takes me back to the s in a bad way.All in all I felt this album is successful and Im glad I gave it a second chance. I also have a better understanding on where it suffers. While I hope their next album does not fall prey to being occasionally too predictable and keeps me engaged from front to back like Drink The Sea did this album gives me really high hopes theyll get it right on their third swing.I give it a  out of !,ElectricForest,cfd5afu,1,t5_2sdfx

1264441,0,t1_cibp4qh,Just want to say I went to Catskill chill one year and we got a good amount of rain.  My tent wasnt taught. Enough because I had to move it once I set it up originally.  So heres the deal.  I grab a huge black trash bag.  I mean biggest you can.  Have a towel.  Two towels maybe but I usually hang mine up and it drys good to go before I need it.  So anyway i roll my sleeping bag up when I leave for the day all of my bedding and toss it in the trash bag.  Rolled up in a way that all I have to do is lay roll it out and I can get right in it to sleep when I needed.   this is that trash bags purpose. Dont get rid of it.  So I also had my clean clothes in that bag as well.  When I went to go lay down after the day of rain due to my tent not being tight and my tent being aged and a bit weathered not water proofed recently I had puddles at the bottom of my tent.  No big deal I dried it up with my dry towel hell maybe even bring a shammie for this f youve got it.  I mean really dry dumped out what puddles I could with out getting my towel wet used the towel to get the rest up.  Of course already made sure there werent any puddles on my tent or under my rain tarp that I have under my tent rolled out my sleeping bag and got a good nights warm sleep.  For no more that  minutes of preparation.   Have a tarp under your tent you can get a plastic sheet from Walmart or miejers Im sure a plastic painters tarp type thing for a few bucks.   I like to get the thicker one in case I miss a rock or stick under my tent if its dark when youre setting up its easy to miss one also.. Roll your tarp up and under your tent.  Do not let it hang out the sides if it rains you will just be giving it an area to catch and end up under your tent.  So roll the edges up and under.  Not over and roll it under your tent completely and inch or so inwards.  ,ElectricForest,cibv65j,3,t5_2sdfx

I think it is better depending on how much you take and how much control you have over yourself. I took the recommended amount of everything and had a faaaantastic time took care of myself and more or less remember everything that happened. I wouldnt say music is better on drugs but they bring out different aspects and really make the music experience unique. On my trips i always feel connected to a bigger part of something and it connects you to the EF crowd because everyone else is doing it lol.

Its a difference of perspective. Some people look at a situation and see the positive and some look at the same situation and see the negative. Theyre both there waiting for someone with the right perspective to notice them.

The porta potty situation in the camping area seemed to be a real problem for all of the Dreamville residents I heard.  They were really terribly maintained throughout out the TW event area as well.

Im workin so i cant find the link but somewhere on the site i read about upgrading after purchase assuming said upgrades are available ofcourse.  Pricewise GL loyalty is a much better deal than maplewoods but in fear of not being able to come to EFF a day early ive been contemplating the maplewoods.  I think its a great idea i would love the woods near my site for shade and hanging of the hammocks.    With that said what kind of shade do they have in GL?  Easy to get a shaded site?  Right now im leanin toward GL even if i cant come a day early the location and amenities alone are worth it IMO but last year when i heard he volunteers campground was in the woods where the disc course was i thought that was prly a legit spot especially if you like hammock camping like me and my friends Tldr  do you think i can buy a loyalty GA on the th and get frontgate on the phone on the th to upgrade to maplewoods.

What can be done to change it?  Does a problem even exist or not?As a staff owner I am super disappointed that every website I see is geared towards hoopers.  Its frustrating not having the same amount of products available.  Your website for example  Hoop service even though you clearly service all products Hoop care instructions what about staff care instructions? Custom hoops no custom staffs except for length Ready made hoops no ready made staffs etc.  I understand the staff was a secondary product but its just as important in my eyes.  Your company doesnt even provide a stock video of the staff in action.  When I asked someone for a picture to show the difference between single strip LEDs and double strip LEDs I was given the stock photo of a ruler the same listed elsewhere on the website.I understand you are working on making a new staff which is great!  And I know the market for staffs just doesnt compete with the market for hoops.  But it would be nice to see the website give a little more attention to staffs instead of it just being an afterthought.Your inputthoughts on this matter would be greatly appreciated.Thank you.,ElectricForest,cp56iab,2,t5_2sdfx

3568903,0,t1_cpz298r,I only have the schedules from the last two years and last year Thursday was certainly a goddamn banger but in  it was Madeon into Benny Benassi at Ranch.  Last years Friday had STS and Umph! at Sherwood Zedd closing the Ranch and Tripolee went th Planet gt Bro Safari gt Andy C gt Excision.  I would agree that Saturday is usually the biggest day meaning we are probably seeing Bassnectar unless they want to avoid a potential repeat of  by having Bassnectar on after SCI.  Sunday does appear to try to slow things down a bit but then again they had PL close out Ranch on Sunday in .IMO I just dont think we can glean much info from past years schedules because while I certainly think some effort is made to schedule artists that make sense to play after each other and on certain days of the week ultimately I think the artists availability dictate who plays when.,ElectricForest,cpz2yu0,2,t5_2sdfx

3667724,0,t3_32d3ic,Well i love my food and i love doing it right. For the A.M. Im making some flap jacks with some batter i premade at home cooked on a propane stove. I bought a camping egg container so I can make my eggs as well which is then topped off with with BACON absolute breakfast material. Also I bring a couple of potatoes easy to store easy to cook. I always keep oatmeal on deck easy to make and good for you. Breakfast is my favorite at my home and my second home.For lunch I stick to the basics ham and cheese samich stacked with potato chips. Im normally away from camp so i buy forest food. Even though I love to cook I love the food there especially tacos. For dinner Im definatly doing the cook out basics. hotdogs cheeseburgers and sausage. buns are tricky to keep in tact though. I work at a BBQ restaurant so I got some Carolina style pulled pork and froze it for the trip. Worked great. If you freeze anything its a good idea to put in a deep freezer a few days before the trip it will last longer. All of this can take up a good amount of space i happened to go with a big group and we were able to distribute accordingly. But like any camping trip I bring two coolers food and beer. the food cooler is pretty much empty until an hour outside of the festival. There we stock up on food that way the buns have less of a chance to get smoothedI may have gotten a little of topic at points but thats how i eat at forest gotta do it right!,ElectricForest,cqacfwl,2,t5_2sdfx

Get some Mandarin oranges in a can also vitamin c! Before the forest we always make a large bowl of pasta salad and divide into ziplock bags for everyday. For the pasta salad we use Rotini noodles cheese crumbles mini pepperonis banana peppers finely chopped onioncelerycarrot and then Italian dressing. Im getting excited just talking about this. We also bring a pack of cheese dogs for the grill and turkeycheese for sandwiches if we dont feel like cooking. Then various snacks such as a giant container of cashewalmonddried cranberry mix granola bars and little chip bags.

How do you guys go about your layering? How do you guys glue your layers so well?.Songs like your remix of shadow of the sun have a beautiful delicate balance of your mids and lows. The mids also sound very stereoey is there a technique behind this?. What are some of your favorite plugins to use for effects?. I struggle to make my sounds big clean and discernable from each other. I use eq and reverb often but maybe you could throw some tips my way?Thanks for doing this AMA guys you were always friendly fellows even when responding to my fb messages haha.

Djs like crizzly and jauz are big enough to have their own dates but probably arent as big in the eyes of promoters and booking agencies. What normally happens is the booking agency will say ok we have a carnage lets make  a tour for him lets add this up and comers to the list to give them exposure. Jauz and crizzly probably have little to no saying about this the booking agency would tell them you have this dates on this cities. Also in the end of the days you gotta pay for the bills and sometimes you gotta play shows you arent really stoked about. They are coming to my city and I am gonna live right before carnage comes I think that speaks more go pack it full for jauz and crizzly then leave for carnage as a big middle finger.,ElectricForest,czdzamh,8,t5_2sdfx

It was literally just shelves with these geometric wooden blocks sitting on it. Im not sure if it was actually a puzzle but God knows we were intent on trying to solve it. Eventually this guy approaches us and introduces himself as Duncan. We converse and make small talk with Duncan while he helps us with our puzzle. A few minutes later a different guy nonchalantly saunters up to us and introduces himself as Duncan. We in such a state of psychedelia did not make the connection that we were in the presence of two Duncans. A few more minutes pass and a third dude walks up to us...you can guess where this is going. Three Duncans and three very confused spunions. This was when we finally figured out that we were being fucked with. The Duncans turned out to be really chill vendors for the sunglasses booth and we ended up with a pair of double refraction shades for each of us and an invitation to come party at their booth after the forest closed for the night. It was such a weird night but we ended up with cool glasses so it evens out. ,ElectricForest,czevw0z,2,t5_2sdfx

7084204,0,t3_4banvm,I would have to say my most miraculous moment happened last year at the end of Forest. We were all sitting in the forest under beautiful glowing lights enjoying the harmonious vibes and meeting new family when the event staff politely asked everyone to leave since the forest was closing. We declined the offer of course but eventually we got up and left. On our way out I happened to notice this guy beat boxing and another person recording him. I stopped to watch because I had recently taken interest in beat boxing and had started learning myself. I watch him for a bit and then another guy comes and starts laying down another beat along with the first guy. It starts sounding pretty sweet so I hop in with a basic percussion line. By this point we are starting to attract a crowd and another person jumps in with a freestyle rap. Yet another person jumps in with a snare line followed by a girl humming a melody. I look around and I see an entire crowd of at least thirty people all dancing to the beat we are putting together. I have never felt more alive more ecstatic or more at home than I felt in that moment.,ElectricForest,d1jd00o,1,t5_2sdfx

7096907,0,t3_4criaj,Ive used Hotglue to glue el wire to overalls before and it worked excellent. If it worked on painted fabric then it will def work on cardboard.  Hotglue is messy and youll have strings of stretched glue all over but it is sturdy enough to hold. Be careful with the hot tip to not touch the el wire directly bc it will melt. Cardboard is super absorbent and will suck up most adhesives such as superglue very quickly so it isnt ideal. While designing dont forget to step back every so often and look at your work from a distance. I always sketch my design with marker before gluing the wire bc it is much easier to follow a sketch than try and freeform it   ,ElectricForest,d1ksz50,5,t5_2sdfx

Ive seen STS axe the cables set x before and theres another one in ATL probably another  happening this year again. Relax.. Electric Forest has repeatedly been fucking up this year stop being a blind follower. . If you want to go sure enjoy your time. . Ill shit wherever I please thank you very much. Edit because I dont want to address you again This is in addition to mine and many others laundry list of complaints. You can search my post history the alcohol ban wiped away my rose tinted glasses and made me realize that Electric Forest isnt as special as people claim. Its just a greedy companys scam between some trees.

7388358,0,t1_d2hghqh,Tara Stiles kills it with the beginner yoga flow videos. When I first started last year I did her lower body upper body and core videos theyre a bit older and all together come out to about min long. I did them everyday for about a week or two. I went from dying to flowing seamlessly. From there I dropped the videos and just getting into my own flow rhythm. One year later I went from barely able to get into a tripod headstand to being able to get into a handstand here and there. But another point about yoga is that it wont necessarily make you look fit. Youll feel it and maybe slightly look a bit toned but I think it would take years of practice along with other types of exercise to look fit. Like I said Ive been doing yoga for a little over a year now and I started off a small guy and I still look practically the same. Even though I know Im stronger than I was last year.Ps.

With that being said I really dont feel like this lineup is complete yet.  For one a few things just seem to still be missing IMO.  The second which guarantees that we WILL have more artists on the lineup is the fact that the All Good curated event at the Observatory still has a few artists that are on the lineup for the curated event as TBA like Russ Liquid BB TBA or Shooka BB TBA.  Im happy with the lineup that we have BUT I will be shocked if we dont end up with another headliner to go up top next to the other  EDM names.  I expect a few smaller names to be added...

Might be a slight contributing factor.          Before any assumptions are made I made sure there was no loose garbage at my campsite before I left.

9484858,0,t3_5aoacn,In terms of nomenclature I wouldnt use the term EDM. EDM typically is used to refer to a highly commercial generic form of electrohouse. Acts like Hardwell or Martin Garrix. That particular vibe  which tends to be a bit more basic and new to electronic music is not really present at Forest. The line up is about a  split between Jam and Electronic. Within what I am calling Jam is actually a lot of diversity  folk bluegrass I have even seen a old school big band play. The electronic music component is always incredibly well balanced  though representing slightly different elements every year. There is always a lot of bass  dubstep and trap. The past few years there has been a lot of deep house.  Two years ago there was a lot of techno. Last year there was little techno but a lot of future. There is always a good representation of more upbeat poppy acts as well like Le Youth Porter Robinson Madeon. In general you can gain a good sense of the electronic music style by looking at thissongissick.comA major part of Forest is the genre bending. There is a ton of electronic  jam mix. Think Griz and All Good Records as well as Gramatik and Low Temp and Big Gigantic. This can also include a lot of more funky and discoey acts. This isnt a festival that you go to because you recognize the line up  its one where the line up shows you whats up. ,ElectricForest,d9i7no3,5,t5_2sdfx

9865943,0,t3_5ghigl,Im probably gonna get downvoted to hell for this but here it goes. First off the answer is that its the gimmickpromotion machine.  Dotcom was a talented trap DJ but had next to no traction.  You cant fault him for reinventing himself. Anyone heard of Wolfgang Gartner?  Yeah thats Joey Youngman. He used to make awesome disco house before changing his style and creating an alter ego.  So dotcom knows he has to change. He picks a slightly more poppy style similar to my ears to waveracer then looks at the gimmick sees deadmau and BOOM. Marshmello. I know people hate the comparisons between deadmau and Marshmello but come the fuck on. Its the same deal. Personally I think Joel is an amazingly talented producer light years beyond what dotcomMarshmelllo is putting out but you cant deny that the helmet gimmick helped sell shows music aside.  His tweet rant against mello seems jealousy fueled as someone else picked up the gimmick and ran with it. They say that imitation is the biggest form of flattery. Deadmau has his shit on lockdown. He should take the compliment and ease the fuck up on the twitter rants and let mello run its course. Its peaking now  and will be dead within the year. ,ElectricForest,datjzss,2,t5_2sdfx

9899054,0,t3_5h5dw9,I agree with the others... theres a limited presale number no way first weekend is already sold out for everyone. I also figure Id add this since this is your first year and you expressed concern about popos... There are state troopers all over at the forest no matter what but they wont fuck with you at the fest unless youre being a dick or openly selling drugs. Most are actually cool they trade kandi and whatnot and are enjoying themselves as much as we are. The time to worry about cops is when youre driving to or from the festival. Theyll pick you out people often recommend to dress like youre not going to a fest no flatbills with pins flower crowns hula hoops etc in sight until youre in line. Second weekend might be a little more trashed than the first weekend but I cant imagine they wouldnt have cleanup crews come through after first weekend.

9988767,0,t3_5inffd,If youre gonna be up a while after you get back to camp its always a good idea to have a couple kinds of lights. Either have headlamps or flashlights to see around and then some mood lighting as well. Many people use Christmas lights. Ive also seen solar landscaping lights lanterns lasers mirror balls rope lights...you get the idea. Bottom line is lighting make a big difference and it can be more than just practical.What kind of group are you in? Active? Chill? A kaleidoscope can be a ton of fun for those late nights if you have lights set up. I bring mine with me all the time. This is something my group found at our campsite at Hula. But without the sling. So we spent the next hour trying to figure out what the hell it was and we each came up with a theory. I thought it looked like a fishing lure because it was pretty much acting as one sucking all of us into its colors and apparent complexity. We ended up deciding its a spunion tool. The point is you may not be able to force this kind of occurance as these random tangents just tend to occur but maybe find some weird puzzles or spunion tools that your group might enjoy!

No cab companies in the area as well closest one is in Muskegon also. A cab to grand rapids would be super expensive  My best suggestions would be to have someone form the group make the drive if you have a car and drop them off in Muskegon air port about a  minute drive or theres a bus station as well maybe take the bus to a bigger city with a better flight option? the drive getting back into forest isint bad at all.
