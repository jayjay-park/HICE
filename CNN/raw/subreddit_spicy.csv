14513,0,t3_1u98nb,I like Daves Ghost Pepper sauce which is getting wider distribution or at least it seems to be.Some people arent super keen on the flavor but I like the subtle smokiness.

With Huy Fong its mostly a single note of flavor. Sharks is indeed more free flowing than Huy Fongs as it is a completely smooth sauce. Since it is more free flowing I note that it needs to be poured carefully unless you want to drown whatever youre putting it on.,spicy,ceoet05,2,t5_2s1qd

253130,0,t1_cf6xrt9,gtI want to be able to cook with them if I cant handle them raw then I wont be able to in food. Thats not true. Using chiles as an ingredient in food will result in less spicy than just eating a raw one for quite a few reasons. First you are diluting the chile by chopping it up and spreading it over a larger number of bites.  Secondly other ingredients in the dish may counteract the spiciness  for instance  dairy.  Thirdly when you chop up the chile you can select the amount of seeds and web to vary the spiciness. ,spicy,cf6zp73,10,t5_2s1qd
258315,0,t3_1wpoli,I started some of my peppers seeds this year in coffee filters same as the paper towel method that I placed on my router and fridge and some in a seedling tray on a heat mat.  The ones that were pregerminated in a coffee filter were planted into small ml plastic cups and topped off with saran wrap. You will get faster germination and better germination rates with the filtertowel method but you will still have to wait to get hooks after you plant the pregerminated seeds.You dont need expensive seed starting mixes. I and many others actually used pure coco coir. I bought a brick of coco coir that expands an fill a  liter . gal bucket and this was plenty. After my seedlings sprouted I repotted them all into  or  inch pots where they still are. I only water with tap water no fertilizerthey get their nutrients from the cotyledons. And the pots sit under two watt watt equivalent CFL lights.Now that they are starting to put out true leaves I will begin watering with a very very low dosage fertilizer. Notice I mentioned I used a nonamended starting mix earlier this is why. It gives you total control over the amount of fertilizers that you are giving your plants. With a lot of commercial mixes a lot of times they come included with fertilizers and if you add your own you could end up burning your plants.Once spring rolls around these plants will be planted directly into the ground or larger containers at which point theyll get normal dosage fertilizer. Unlike other growers here I would recommend planting directly into the ground simply bc youll have far fewer issues with overunder watering the ground is a far better regulator of temperature and you wont have to worry about potting up to bigger containers giving the plants infinitely room to expand their roots.  Will you deal with bugs? Sure you will but youll deal with just as many in containers.Finally join www.thehotpepper.com where you find TONS of information as well as a great community of people myself included who love all things spicy. Good luck!,spicy,cf7j4zs,2,t5_2s1qd

403678,0,t3_1ypjdv,I love heat. That said I have a limit. I am a profuse sweater I generally will not even eat anything over a medium sauce at Buffalo Wild Wings because my body will drench me. I love for example their Wild sauce but to eat in public would mortify my wife because after eating say  boneless wings with a generous amount of that sauce you would be able to wring out my shirt. So I have migrated more to the flavor section I still like ghost pepper jerky and such but at home. My favorite sauce for both the smoky citrus flavor and heat is Black Mamba. Just a few drops in a bowl of chili can change the whole character.

I can only guess that if I bought some for other food it would screw up their inventory control system but theyre not exactly the Good times great taste McDonalds they were back in the day so hot sauce might be a good way to add some newness to their stores.

9467570,0,t1_d9g0j3k,Just read more about it. I think the key here may be to use red cabbage juice baking soda salty and more salt for a salty spicy sauce. May be great on potato based dishes. Thinking of a paste like consistancy... may also use purple carrots or purple potatoes and see if they react to trying blue too like the cabbage. To add a good body to sauce outside of the cabbage and pepper fiber.. garlic is a must in my book here...

9648765,0,t3_5d7h0a,Honestly Id just start by trying different things from your local grocery store. Theres no rush just try different things and keep putting more of the sauces you like on until you reach your limit. When you get used to it add more andor try a spicier sauce.I personally find Sriracha hotter than Franks so perhaps try that next if you havent already. Cholula tastes great but isnt that hot. El Yucateco has some great ones and is probably among the hottest ones you can get at big grocery stores at least in my experience with Safeways in my area go Green gt Red gt eXXXtra Hot. Or try the hotter ones earlier if you feel up to it and put less on your food at a time. I personally hate Tabasco original but you might like it I do like Tabasco Habanero a lot and it is impressively spicy.Lots of people on this sub always say to avoid commercialymade sauces because of all the added salt et c. ...I personally dont really care about that so if you dont care either than try the readilyavailable and inexpensive ones at the grocery store. Those ones should keep you going for a bit and start to increase your tolerance until you have an opportunity to try the better and hotter smallerbatch stuff. If you do care about salt and stuff and you have access and dont mind paying more at this point then try some of the other ones that others will no doubt recommend shortly.,spicy,da2es0k,1,t5_2s1qd
