1026715,0,t3_25tfht,This is horrible.... R.I.P. To the kid who passed away. I really hope this was not drug related. Before Sungod I started see a lot of posts on social media promoting drug use at sungod as a way to get around the alcohol crack down. I sent a facebook message to the sungod page with screenshots of all the posts and also sent emails to the AS President and the person incharge of concerts and UCSD Health and safety urging them to take preventive measures and ban people opening promoting drug use.... What followed next was pretty unbelievable in my opinion. Some in AS then sent messages to the people say hide what you posted so you dont get in trouble. They did not inform the administration nor the police which they should of done first. And I got this email Thank you for bringing this post to our attention. Each time we make a change for the festival we must be cognizant of the unintended consequences that result. This post is not conducive to the new health and safety initiatives we have installed this year and does not promote a safe festival. With that being said this post was made on a students private facebook page. We do not have the capacity to deny access to the festival based on social media posts. Had this post been directed to usit was the sungod page was tagged in it we would have followed up with our health and safety information as well as festival guidelineswhich they did not. Everyone knows preventive action is the best course to take. If this turns out to be drug related there should be a full investigation of AS and people who failed to take action and ignore warnings should be kicked out of UCSD.  ,UCSD,chkzs80,-20,t5_2r6sq

I would ignore rankings though and go what school fits you better because at the end of the day going to a slightly higher ranked school wont play much of a difference. Also just know that a lot of faculty is only here for research and they dont care about you at all as a student.

1167720,0,t3_27gft5,You are taking  and  in  quarter which is major lols  expect to spend the whole day in the labs all quarter if you want an A just for  and I mean literally the whole day all quarter as well as  and  in  quarter which are both classes that have a bit of work unless you were extremely knowledgeable in the subjects already. You are also taking  major classes including L and  in  quarter. Even if you were top tier that is not possible.Plans like this are never going to work. You will never get the classes you need unless you have a ton of units and I remember I had trouble getting in  Mobile as well as a senior so itll be difficult for someone to get other classes sometimes I had a lot of units. Sometimes there are schedule conflicts and sometimes they wont offer classes in some quarters.The good professors are usually also more difficult. You shouldnt be looking for difficult professors with this kind of schedule. I know the easier professors which arent necessarily the great ones but Graham for  is great and easy. Khang and Dasgupta are both great for  but pretty hard. Pasquale is the general consensus for the better professor for  but harder than Zhou but I took Zhou and did well... Ord is a good professor and youll be taking him for sure for . Hes medium difficulty easy in the earlier classes pretty hard in the later ones.editI tried something like you actually in my first years I took nothing but major classes and left my GE requirements for later. It worked well so it is certainly doable but later on it turned to be harder and harder and doing L and  other major classes including  and another project based class in  quarter is REALLY terrible. Other advice is to never take classes you dont need. You dont need C for java programmers. It probably wont help either. Youll get enough pointer skill from taking CSE and if you still dont have pointer skills youll gain them for sure after . You also dont need ECE which I heard was way harder than CSE and MATH. I also counted  electives and not . You need  to graduate you seem to be CS B.S.. I suggest CSE. Like someone else said you dont want to be doing summer school and instead finding internships. Internships is what gets you jobs later on. It doesnt matter even if you do finish in  years if you cant really get a job out of it not to mention a low GPA due to too many classes which will detriment the job searching process if you dont have any prior experience. Take  with your internship is my best advice.,UCSD,ci0zlmv,2,t5_2r6sq

4096361,0,t3_37htrc,I had learned about graffiti hall when I was a freshman and would wander around the campus alone when I had time in between classes opening every door that I could and going to the roofs of any buildings I could get to. I was surprised to find more graffiti in HSS when I randomly opened a door that had a man drawn on the front. Then I found APampM and McGill. I added to the work that was already there and one time I randomly found a middle aged man in the middle of a school day painting on the ground at the top of the APampM stairwell. We scared the shit out of each other because no one expects anyone to be up there. I wrote poetry and did drawings and wrote quotes all over the place. I also would smoke a J in the stairwells in between classes while drawing. Not many people knew about the multiple graffiti halls on campus and I personally didnt tell or show them to anyone I wanted them to find them for themselves if they were curious enough to look. I did not know about the history of it all but had seen dates from the s written that shocked me and made me feel a part of a generation of UCSD creatives who wandered the campus. I went back to the campus last Fall after having graduated a couple of years ago and the HSS door I had gone to was locked and the halls in APampM were painted along with graffiti hall and along with cameras installed. I think it is sad to limit expression of students at a campus especially one so academically stringent as ours. I had know idea they were called the Peeps and while I may not have been there decades I contributed to those halls with the time that I had. Thank you for doing this research. Also I had begun to write under benches at night all over campus as well as under some desks. It is harder to cover over and no one really looks under benches and thus the graffiti tends to remain untouched. ,UCSD,crn7lhq,2,t5_2r6sq

I explained my situation and reasons and they said they would relay them to some committee to be approved. The Muir student affairs people were super helpful and supportive.One thing In addition to the medical documentation I had to get signatures from the professors of both classes I was withdrawing from and also the chair of both of their departments at least I think it was the chair. The professors were of course cooperative but I still had to go to get their signatures as well as visit both departments offices for the chair signature. Just a bit of leg work.

In terms of difficulty I had no trouble taking  units at my community college....at UCSD Ive taken  units a quarter and its really all variable.  My  units this quarter are much harder than the  units I did last winter.  It just depends on how many mathscience classes you have to take at once.  I would stick to no more than  science  semester units and  math class  semester units  and then add one elective  units.  If its a relatively easy semester you can always add another class.Also I dont think IGETC affects engineering  stick to prerequisites for sure.

7003112,0,t3_4bj27m,He is actually a pretty interesting guy. He originally was an Economics PhD student  at UCSD when both his parents passed away unexpectedly and he was forced to drop out. He became homeless and lived out of a tent in the wooded area by Warren. He began tutoring in empty lecture halls until being escorted out by campus police multiple times. He gained enough of a following to afford an office off campus to run his tutor sessions. Pretty remarkable story actually.Alot of econ professors at ucsd dont like him because he does have a few students working for him to gather problem sets and access to class portals and offers solutions to homework and STATA projects. I remember Prof. Muendler was very outspoken in his criticism of the econ tutor and even did an interview with a local paper stating that Eric was a failure for dropping out of his PhD program and that students should avoid going to his sessions. Regardless of what you think of Erics story and methods i wouldnt be  reliant on his tutor sessions for your econ classes and would only use them as a supplement.

Their goal is to be the first college to send a solidpropellant rocket past the Karman Line i.e. into space. I would say they are actively getting closer and closer to their goal with their iteratively larger rockets each year. UCSDSEDS just recently finished successfully building and launching a liquidpropulsion rocket fueled by kerosene and liquid oxygen. The different nature of propellants affects the systems engineering and plumbing of the rocket greatly. Not to take away from TRCs accomplishments but liquid propulsion is generally regarded as more difficult and labortime intensive.SEDS requires application screening and an interview for specific positions e.g. mechanical design engineer structural analysis aeroshell integration although after some experience within SEDS people generally are free to join another subteam provided they can do the work. It also is a much larger time commitment than TRC. On the other hand TRC allows anyone willing to commit on their team. Note that this does not mean that TRC is less experienced than SEDS or somehow inferior  both teams have fantastic and brilliant engineers.SEDS has multiple projects going on at the same time  a new Static Fire System named Colossus a cubesat called Triteia in NASAs competition to get a slot on the SLS rocket with the goal of putting the satellite into lunar orbit propulsions and fluid simulation RampD and the businessPR division you dont have to be an engineer to be passionate about space haha. After the Colossus system is finished SEDS intends to do research into a spacecraft hovercapable lander. TRC does have PR and business plus other subteams but it revolves around their rockets as opposed to SEDSs diverse set of projects.Both groups will give you valuable hands on engineering and social experience.

9614225,0,t1_d9y466d,The video in question the subversion one is special in the sense that its a perspective from a man who used to work at the USSR fled from the Russia and explains why did he do that.Its a unique perspective hard to find anywhere else so saying you can just find other videos like it but arguing the opposite is not an easy task. If theres the argument that video would be literally leaving your own bubble and then spark interest in areas youre not used to read and that will by all means increase your knowledge.If after you worked through that and saw the perspective of the man in question and for some reason you disagree you think he was wrong for leaving the USSR and you think theres no subversion going on on the U.S then that is fine.That is definitely not a video to be ignored if you wish to be informed on the world around you though.tldr even if your views align with a progressive view you should still watch that and understand the parts of it that perhaps you dont agree with and protect others from the ugly side that comes with the radical left.For example you understand how relevant that video is the moment that you see Universities students around the United States burning the U.S flag so maybe just maybe that video may open your eyes to what is happening around you and has been going on for more than  years.

Speed for locking your bike is all about how you position your bike before you even start messing with your lock if you get it in the right place the lock just slides on. Yeah unlocking can take longer since usually other bikes will have been parked next to you in the meantime but I would say the average time wouldnt be more than  seconds if locking and unlocking your bike is something you do numerous times every day.
