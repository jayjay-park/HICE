The daughter is always asking for people to get her things she has asked for Gatorade and Lipton iced tea and other random things because they dont have the money for it. A bunch of people at my office and I signed a card and mailed it to her she posted her address online because she was asking for something for her birthday back in November. We didnt put a return address on it because we dont actually want to engage with her. But someone once sent her an anonymous gift a bag of gummy dicks and she made a video about it because she was so thrilled. And she has made other videos about things shes received. So we thought she would like getting a card with almost  signatures on it. But she never mentioned it on Facebook. She seems to only want material things. A friend of mine lives down the street from her and sees her acting crazy all around town. ,FacebookCringe,ddjas7g,5,t5_2w02s
