2846980,0,t3_2s93zf,Do you have any personal experience with Noni? Just curious because as someone else said I have read that a lot of Noni benefits is hype from the companies that produces it. I am definitely going to check out the studies you linked though! ,Herblore,cnrp8wx,1,t5_2qsbs
2895258,0,t1_cnx6c5l,I am sticking up for nutmeg! Its delicious! Also since my posts arent about psychoactive uses but about medicinal uses thats largely a secondary point. The important thing is that medicinally its kinda useless.,Herblore,cnx70pp,2,t5_2qsbs
2913653,0,t1_cnydmun,Fat cannot be excreted by the body once theyve been absorbed into the body. Its one of the reasons people have trouble losing weight.What it would have been is steatorrhea combined with diarrhea from the laxative effect of excess ascorbic acid and some of the mucosal lining of the intestines. Steatorrhea is basically stools that contain excess fatty concentrations. If you eat food that has fat in it but because of a problem with your intestines you cant then absorb that fat it will simply continue down the tube that is your body and be excreted. Steatorrhea smells absolutely foul and its generally oily and greasy from the fat it contains. The intestines are also coated on the insides with a mucous lining that would have been damaged and excreted both by the vast quantities of vitamin C but mostly by the diarrhea. This would be flushed out of the body as a sticky viscous yellowbrown substance. The thing you linked is describing the effects of vitamin C and the salt compounds it produces on food when used as an additive for preservation. Vitamin C is often used as a preservative since its technically natural and therefore doesnt need to be listed under artificial preservatives added.Vitamin C is an antioxidant meaning it absorbs free oxygen radicals into itself and stops them bouncing around damaging other chemicals. The passage is describing how ascorbic acid and its Na K and Ca salts are watersoluble and therefore cannot enter fatty deposits and absorb any free oxygen radicals inside them. Instead fatsoluble ascorbic acid salts known as esters are used for this purpose. The passage is basically saying if youre trying to preserve waterbased foods like fruits use the Na K and Ca salts. If youre preserving meats use the esters. Its not talking about breaking down fat at all since ascorbic acid cant do that.,Herblore,cnzag7a,3,t5_2qsbs
3030840,0,t3_2uv0l8,Yarrow stalks are also used traditionally when casting the I Ching. I forget how theyre used exactly its more common to toss coins in order to get a hexagram but yarrow was used before the minting of coins came about.,Herblore,coc57lq,3,t5_2qsbs
3426383,0,t3_2zgfsa,another excellent post thanks so much for lending your expertise.  I found a great source of valerian root recently and had just been making tea from it  Ill crush it up and make capsules or at the least ingest the powder with the tea.  ,Herblore,cpitzzb,1,t5_2qsbs

4773112,0,t3_3g6oko,I got a carpet burn on my right knee doing Jiu Jitsu drills. Chopped up and mixed saliva into  rather than chewed up because it tastes kinda gross  some Yarrow leaves and applied a poultice to the wound. Forgot to add plantain but its healing quite nicely.,Herblore,ctw6z16,3,t5_2qsbs
5299054,0,t3_3nkbx1,Here are two sites that are worth checking out and very much worth contributing to  falling fruit  English language centered and mostly active in the US and UK but there is a host of stuff from all over the world there.  Mundraub  German language and mostly active in Europe and surprise German speaking countries.  Again there is some crossover and its worth checking into.  More than that I cant tell you.  Be aware of what youre picking and where youre picking it take cuttings of healthy native herbs and replant them elsewhere in the city!  Good luck!,Herblore,cvp0kbv,1,t5_2qsbs
7172841,0,t1_d1t7kdc,Properly made bone broth is high in gelatin denatured collagen minerals amino acids and calcium. Gelatin in particular will also help you to absorb nutrients from other foods and is fantastic at promoting strong hair growth. Adding seaweed to your bone broth would also be a good idea especially with your hypothyroidism for iodine. Mushrooms such as shiitake and maitake wouldnt hurt either for immune support and added nourishment.Heres a good article to get you started. Pacific also makes a great bone broth you can buy at the grocery store.,Herblore,d1thgd9,2,t5_2qsbs

10389063,0,t1_dcienn8,He is not treating you well. He seems to not be willing to make an effort for what hes made your problem as well. He needs to do more than be willing to drink tea that you buy and prepare for him.,Herblore,dclnyox,1,t5_2qsbs
