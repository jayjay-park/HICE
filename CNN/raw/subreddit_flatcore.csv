74769,0,t3_1ususl,Goodbye village breeders...As of wb villagers must be traded to become willing to mate willingness is granted the first time a new offer is traded or at a oneinfive chance on subsequent trades. This will not cause them to immediately seek out a mate however. After mating they will no longer be willing and must be traded with again before becoming willing again.,flatcore,cemxwp5,3,t5_2u7tu

981176,0,t3_25bupr,. Right clicking a slimeball releases you from Limbo immediately. Heres how to get more of those you get one for starters.. Before clicking the respawn crystal its valuable to check the time. There was a clock display just next to the crystal on the left.. Spells and Absorption boosts were just added. More here. If you ever find yourself trapped in someones claim without a way out use trapped,flatcore,chftgew,1,t5_2u7tu

3650047,0,t1_cq83ry4,Very interesting. Does this mean sea level defaults to y for superflat? It made me wonder because I thought there was a configurable setting for sea level now but nope thats when you build a full customized world not superflat.It also made me wonder if sea level is  and weather was on would it snow at higher elevations in a plains biome?  But once again nope. the temp base for plains is . and the gradiant is .  .    . Nope not less than the . it would take to generate snow.We lose squid and gain nothing. shucks,flatcore,cq8bz57,4,t5_2u7tu
