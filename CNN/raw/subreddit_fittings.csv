497014,0,t3_1ztats,The fitting and use of AARs over standard reps is situation dependent just like anything else. Youll get more potential HP from a AAR over standard reps in the short term but conversely standard reps allow you to extend fights longer and have more HP potential in the long term. AARs have a  second reload time but can operate less efficiently without charges. I recommend to use AARs on frigates for the reason you stated but that doesnt mean standard reps arent viable esp deadspace because they can come close to being as efficient as AAR. AARs are also quite common on larger setups as well and were beginning to see a lot of active armor kiting in the meta see Navy Omen that utilizes AARs for their tank. Ultimately it comes down to how you intend to fly your ships. Quick fights you want the AAR longer drawn out fights a standard rep may be a better option.,fittings,cfwriol,4,t5_2vr2x

Or if you want something that helps on field too the agility and speed one for faster align and etc.Or else stick on a burst aerator and a colli one for extra dps the higher it is the less you have to deal with things repping up and I would imagine for rails this is doubly true esp given the cost of tech I rigs vs II.Example if your dps is  and their rep is  reps  effective dps if you increase your dps to  it is not a simple  increase in dps but rather a massive doubling of effective dps since you are doing  dps   reps   effective dps.

For FW lowsec solo my usual fit is x LSE point MWD and surprisingly x sensor boosters.   Kind of weird but hear me out.   Curse is arguably one of the strongest solo boats in the game and anyone in their right mind would never fight one solo plus most ships in FW space are small hence the sebos allow you to actually catch and kill something.   Other mids I will use sometimes would look a lot like you but I also carry x TD and x MD.    While a cap booster looks nice if you manage your cap well and keep your cap at peak regen you can get away with out one.

10461303,0,t1_dctv7f7,A rule of thumb about the sleeper relicsdata sites is they are as difficult as a regular combat site from a higher class i.e. a C data site will be the same as a C combat site. Any t battlecruiser will already struggle in a C combat site and the harder relic sites can push more than dps see here  I would suggest looking at doing C combat sites to start with using something like this    Gnosis wormhole alpha    Shield Power Relay II    Shield Power Relay II    Shield Power Relay II    Shield Power Relay II    Shield Power Relay II    Damage Control II    Large Shield Extender II    Large Shield Extender II    Large Shield Extender II    Limited Adaptive Invulnerability Field I    Limited Adaptive Invulnerability Field I    MN Afterburner II    mm Scout Artillery I Republic Fleet Phased Plasma M    mm Scout Artillery I Republic Fleet Phased Plasma M    mm Scout Artillery I Republic Fleet Phased Plasma M    mm Scout Artillery I Republic Fleet Phased Plasma M    mm Scout Artillery I Republic Fleet Phased Plasma M    Small Energy Nosferatu II    Medium Core Defense Field Purger I    Medium Core Defense Field Purger I    Medium Core Defense Field Purger I    Hammerhead I x    Hobgoblin I xOnce you feel comfortable knowing how much you can tank and how the ship performs bear in mind this fit is max tanked so you can carry a mobile depot and refit gyrostabilizersdrone damage amplifiers as you clear dps off the field then by all means give a C dataC combat site a shot but be ready to leave at any moment watch out for the frigates which warp disrupt you and energy neutralizers which will turn off your invulnerability fields. Also you didnt specify what race you were so I put arty on there. Medium railguns beam lasers and heavy missiles will do okay too.,fittings,dctw8cg,3,t5_2vr2x

11315299,0,t1_dfe834u,If you are hunting in packs it will really open a lot of options for you. Perhaps most importantly more damage to bring enemy dps off the field. If youre trying to squeeze more survivability at some point remember that the damage control module in a lowslot does not have the same kinds of stacking penalties as putting more shield resists. You could also consider bringing logistics if one of your fleet buddies can do it. ,fittings,dfekkff,1,t5_2vr2x
