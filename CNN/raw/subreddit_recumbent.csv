3995448,0,t3_367cuk,How do you like the mesh seat and horizontal handlebars?Could you bend over enough to take your shoe off while it is clipped in?I got a recumbent trike about a month or so ago LOVE IT  I have FM and spinal injury I cant balance any more so a  wheeler is out of the question  I dont have any trouble with twisting my feet so I dont have the same battle that you do but I wonder if you could clip the shoe in and then put your feet in the shoe I couldnt do that because I cant bend enough to do it. Putting my shoes on is a real battle when they arent clipped inCongrats on the bike!,recumbent,crbpq8f,1,t5_2rjgt
4783621,0,t3_3gefd7,First of all you may be able to simply add a quick link and repair your chain.  However if the chain has stretched it will need to be replaced.  Some local bike shops do have chain by the foot.  This video shows the way to go. Other shops only have precut chains. You can join several together about  for my Bacchetta highracer.  Or you can order online. The Hostel Shoppe is a retailer specializing in recumbent parts. Theyll surely be able to help you.   Finally theres Edge Recumbents. They bought the jigs and are making some of the Burley models again. Or they were as of a few years ago. I havent kept up. They may be able to assist you in finding a chain. ,recumbent,ctxikhq,1,t5_2rjgt

Just check if both front wheels point in the same direction by measuring their distance at different places some are using some stick some a tape some use chalk marks parallel to the wheels.And it needs to be done regularly if youre careless and hitting things regularly. Or try climbing stairs with your trike.,recumbent,cvvmlby,3,t5_2rjgt
