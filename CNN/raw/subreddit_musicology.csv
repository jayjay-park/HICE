8910741,0,t3_528r1h,Currently working on my PhD in communication after doing a bachelor in music and a masters in musicology. Although I LOVE studying music I find some of the musicology field to be a little insular  hence the move to communication. I also did it as a means to make myself more employable. This might not be in the case in the states but communications is a quickly growing field in Canada  less so musicology. With universities employing less tenure track positions Ive opted for an umbrella field that still lets me study music. One thing to keep in mind is that musicology is not just learning old fact its about understanding WHY things are the way they are. If you loved theory and counterpoint you might actually want to consider going the music theory route instead. Not to say that you wont use them in musicology but it depends where your interest really lie. My advice look at some programmes that would interest you see what classes are offered and whether they sound like something you would enjoy. Depending on the campus you might even be able to ask to sit in on a class to get a better feel of what it would be like. Most of the people doing their PhD with me are older so dont let that deter you! Also I know lots of people who were able to find employment with just a Masters so if the PhD doesnt work out and it is A LOT of work  I love it but sometimes I do wonder why Im putting myself through it you certainly havent wasted your time.Another thing you might consider go to either SAM or AMS music conferences in the coming year. They are the biggest musicology conferences in the States and will give a great feel for what is happening in the field,musicology,d7ixvy2,4,t5_2sgj0
