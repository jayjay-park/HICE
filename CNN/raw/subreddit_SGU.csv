286849,0,t1_cerxfo2,gt I just dont want to believeNever a good strategy in the pursuit of the truth. As skeptics were supposed to follow the evidence wherever it leads. When we start looking to uphold a worldview we run into the exact same intellectually dishonest traps that plague religion and all other ideologies. ,SGU,cfahv6y,2,t5_2roqv

6859144,0,t1_d0tnfai,So this is an ongoing debate within Reddit about what should and shouldnt be downvoted or upvoted. I like the concept of upvote if this is what you want to see in the subreddit.I do however see different modes of operation for different types of votes. Voting on submissions I find much more tolerable of downvote if you disagree. A submission is sometimes reasonably viewed as a light endorsement or at least an elevation of the post as important. Obviously context in the title of the submission can drastically change that approach. This one is completely neutral but with how flatly rude I find Harris to be it raises questions about if this can be interpreted as a small endorsement. This isnt a link to an informative overview of the situation with opinion its just his opinion.Anyway Im diving into a very small point that even I dont know how I feel about it other than to identify some factors at play.When it comes to comments I generally only downvote if its crass simplistic unhelpful or inflammatory. I especially try to upvote civil disagreement where I detect nuance.I think this is an important conversation to be having. I wonder if tying it too closely to the particulars of this post as I did oops! will limit its scope. Theres certainly something to be said about the importance of grappling with the opposite side and learning where people stand even without the post title commentary priming you to do so. Of course this isnt a new idea and in fact listen to my flaming disagreement is often annoyingly weaponized to justify harassment but its useful to consider it for this situation.,SGU,d0tsk6x,3,t5_2roqv

7938004,0,t3_4nyz5s,Thanks for posting this big fan of Steves. Hes one of the best populariserscommunicators of computer security out there. His vitamin and health kick has been odd and I tend to not pay it too much attention but Id be cool to know if hes on to something. Hes definitely sincere in his convictions. His page on it recommends no particular product and he has no affiliate links of any kind. He legit just wants to find the best sleep formula. ,SGU,d48b1vi,3,t5_2roqv
8562750,0,t3_4x0dd8,A remember a ways back they were talking about SGU interns. This is the kind of work Id expect that role to fill whether an intern was ultimately hiredvolunteered or not.Editing is a timeconsuming and IMO soulsucking process. Its not trivial to populate another outlet though it might not be too challenging to add into the existing process. Still theyre super busy.,SGU,d6bx6o1,2,t5_2roqv
