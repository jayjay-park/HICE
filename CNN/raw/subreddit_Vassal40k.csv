1699086,0,t3_2daoro,Ok guys Im getting out of this vassal league. Im not having fun anymore to be blunt Im seeing a bit of a aggressive ramping up and Im finding games more stressful and less fun as the points increase and the game goes by. The long game times are also getting harder and harder to schedule.Anyway I know its nearly done but Im dropping out. Guamie was a fine gentleman to face but I cut it short because i realized I was no longer interested in this league. Sorry. ,Vassal40k,cjtbznu,1,t5_2t62k

4161095,0,t1_crucj2q,How cool would it be if people on the internet came together to make their own game. People could write the rules write the lore and design the models. Then all the d model plans would be released for anyone to print out. I just think that would be awesome.,Vassal40k,crukp8e,1,t5_2t62k
4313375,0,t3_37prtz,I am with Zenith on this topic because it allows both players to have more say. So with that being said I will just echo the points zenith has already made. Just make sure that you and everyone else involved agrees on how the board is setup.,Vassal40k,csbudqa,1,t5_2t62k
