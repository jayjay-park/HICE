You can mount Camo if youre really into the whole stealth camping thing but you should remember that if you train the BIA crew skill youre essentially given your tank an effective  stat increase which with the aiming time due to the bad gun traverse reload and traverse speed of the ISU make an noticeable difference.Dont mount Binocs. you have scouts use them. Furthermore you cant achieve max view range by mounting Binocs.If you want more information on how to play the tank what crew skills to train and of course the equipment that you can use refer to this video Edit How come youre at tier  with only  crew skill and why isnt it sixth sense?

3464212,0,t1_cpmv82v,All the servers all the days.But mostly people are on east. There was a schism when the Soviet tanks were released. West and east used to have comparable populations at most times. After Soviet tanks launched the west server experienced the days of darkness. Somehow they could only keep east running through the most anticipated update. Then  person platoons were a thing which took most of the remaining players from west when they decided they actually wanted to play a game and not sit in the que for . minutes only to be returned to the garage.Since all of this west has been slowly increasing in size and I like to attribute that to new players who werent around when the mass migration happened. Sometimes good players will venture onto west only to be scared away by teams that are more incompetent than you could imagine.So I guess what Im trying to say is east.

5934135,0,t3_3wmow3,Its just not the same. But I will admit that it probably doesnt feel nerfed because of the MM changes it received. The gun doesnt have nearly the pen it used to the acceleration and track traverse are much slower the dispersions a bit increased and the view range is down. Its just a softer version of the best tank that ever tanked. As has already been said in here there is just no comparison to the feeling of taking a tier  tank up against tier tens and coming out on top because of your mobility and rapid fire gun. Also it was hilarious going one v one with Jagerus becuase the only place you could pen them was that hatch on the back and only  of the time. ,WorldofTanksXbox,cxxhupn,6,t5_2xim5

6369815,0,t1_czdo2u6,have to agree with this. there seems to be a real tipping point in terms of pen around mm the pdr could help to allow you to shoot out of trouble but it isnt really a brawler so the Royal Ordnance is definitely the gun of choice for me. The HESH is piss poor though  I think HESH and HE rounds are fundamentally broken though  I caught a lone T Waffle  on the PZIV hull  so its HE time hit it on upper hull side  mm armour so im a definite pen   mm HE from the Leopard PTA did  damage. That made me really happy I can tell you. It seems only the mm HE is any good at higher tiers.,WorldofTanksXbox,czdof76,1,t5_2xim5

6553312,0,t1_czx4zga,I hate them so much Im for removing them entirely but as you say they probably do have a place in the game but it needs a rework. Because as it is the mentality of the drivers is what ruins the class combined with the ease at which tanks can be one shot. A few tweaks such as what you mention would counter the average tomato arty player from picking on the easiest targets for self gain rather than the harder targets required by the team for the collective victory.,WorldofTanksXbox,czx5zi1,1,t5_2xim5

6803254,0,t3_48w3xr,Try swapping your inverted reverse setting. This tends to be the issue when most people think their tank drives weird. Especially if you find your tank rotates oddly or randomly spazzes what usually happens on default setting is the controller hits the  updown mark and suddenly reverses turn direction.If this doesnt help I suggest trying other control schemes. I personally use control scheme B So I dont accidentally click cruise control onoff with inverted reverse on but many people also like control scheme C AKA battlefield controls.,WorldofTanksXbox,d0nfxm1,1,t5_2xim5
