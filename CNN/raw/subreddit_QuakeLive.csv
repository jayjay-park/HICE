1672749,0,t1_cjpc5kk,gt How will they do that? Would Quake no longer require aim knowledge of where to be predicting where your opponent will go and what theyll do?Disingenuous rebuttal. Every shooter to a certain extent plays on these elements regardless of the height of its skill ceiling. There are always going to be better players than others. The question is a matter of degrees.Ask yourself why arena shooters as a whole and Quake in particular have the reputation they do for being so skillintensive. Its because theyve never kowtowed to the trappings of what most other shooters do in their effort to garner a wider appeal particularly in the past few years. When you do so youre naturally going to start compromising.  gt Would consistently stacking healtharmor powerups while denying them to your opponent thus granting you kills not constitute a display of skill? How do these changes turn fights into who put the crosshair near their enemy and fired first?Again you are really misrepresenting the concerns people have here. Where did the person youre quoting ever remotely say that? The only thing youre doing here is knocking down strawmen. gt I do not think Quake is so shallow in your eyes that you think the player who strafejumps better wins.No the player who strafejumps better doesnt always win just like the player with the best map control or best aim doesnt always win but these various attributes certainly help in demarcating players and the changes being made here threaten to make those less pronounced. Someone who isnt the strongest aimer around relative to his or her closest competition can still get a leg up based on effectiveness with map timings superior movement and so on and it would be ideal keep the potential skill gap there as wide as is expected.,QuakeLive,cjq0fqb,2,t5_2r5dy

3150075,0,t3_2w86cj,I came from ra to quakelive and essentially still only played clan arena servers. It took me a fair while to get used to the default settings in ql and at first I hated it. But at the same time your only chance of playing online consistently at least here in Australia is to adopt the rules of the servers that are always full. Now that Im used to it its really fun. And to be fair with rail being slightly nerfed it doesnt matter if someone is always using it with back. Theyre still very much killable and not nearly as painful.  Im a little less happy with the more recent shaft nerf that dropped lg cells from  to  dmg. I always run out of ammo now.Anyway I guess my point is while its kinda shit to begin with it is possible to get used to and enjoy just as much! Good luck and welcome back! Edit that said no ca servers Ive ever played on have had the nail gun or bfg or anything. Fuck that shit. The hmg has just replaced the mg though so no real huge change there. ,QuakeLive,cooi38n,3,t5_2r5dy
3238473,0,t3_2x4gmb,LG is  prediction and  cursor placement.What helped me consistently hit over  was changing how I approached the fight. Instead of concentrating on putting the crosshair the enemy concentrate on howwhere you expect your opponent to move. Leave the cursor placement to your subconscious. This is important. Player models move so quickly in quake it is impossible to track well with no prediction and strong LG aimers understand this. I say howwhere rather than just where because generally players have a dodge style which depends quite reliably on how long theyve played for. If I face a tier opponent i can expect to see long regular side to side strafes. Tier  Dodgers dodge similarly but with faster and shorter strafes. Strong Tier  Dodgers will be faster and shorter still but will also vary the length of the side to side motion in a random hard to follow way with the occasional very long strafe. So as the fight begins I am ready to move the crosshair in a way that matches the way I expect them to move and then once the fight begins and I see how they actually do move I adjust my aiming strategy. The very strongest Dodgers will force you to rely more on reactionary cursor placement but you wont face them until you are fighting  CA Elo players. ,QuakeLive,coxoamm,3,t5_2r5dy

9044017,0,t3_543k85,Well your friend isnt wrong about Quake being a relatively tiny community with a ton of veterans that have played for a million hours. However that doesnt mean the game is completely unapproachable for a new player. Especially if youve already got experience competing in other FPS games. As long as you understand the challenge and approach it with a proper competitive mindset youll be fine. The challenge with Quake isnt just the game play its self. You also have to deal with the fact that due to the current lack of popularity that has been present for a long time there arent a lot of well organized resources for learning the game. And theres a lot of nuances to learn in competitive Quake. In other words theres not just a lot to learn but the learning will be tricky because of the lack of good guides and documentation. Its all out there but its really not organized or centralized at all. If you know anyone knowledgeable your best bet would be to see if they would guide you through learning the game. Id gladly help you by answering any further questions but I havent played serious Quake in years so I might not be the best in game mentor when you combine that with my relatively little play time I give myself during the week. Good luck to you! Dont let any toxic idiots you may run into ruin your experience. Find good people and play with them. ,QuakeLive,d7yy2in,1,t5_2r5dy
