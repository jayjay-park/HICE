127594,0,t1_cesylze,Heres a bit from linked Wikipedia article about YagiUda antenna  gtA YagiUda array commonly known simply as a Yagi antenna is a directional antenna consisting of a driven element typically a dipole or folded dipole and additional parasitic elements usually a socalled reflector and one or more directors. The name stems from its inventors as the YagiUda array was invented in  by Shintaro Uda of Tohoku Imperial University Japan with a lesser role played by his colleague Hidetsugu Yagi. However the Yagi name has become more familiar with the name of Uda often omitted. The reflector element is slightly longer typically  longer than the driven dipole whereas the socalled directors are a little shorter. This design achieves a very substantial increase in the antennas directionality and gain compared to a simple dipole.Picture  A threeelement YagiUda antenna used for amateur radio. The longer reflector element left the driven element center and the shorter director right each have a socalled trap parallel LC circuit inserted along their conductors on each side allowing the antenna to be used at two different frequency bands.image source | about | uGratefulTony can reply with delete.

But im not making any money off of it. Not spamming. i just though this community would be open minded about darknet experiments. The sites ARE decentralized once more than one person views a site. Once another person views the site the creator can drop off line and the peers will continue to distribute the site with nothing that i can tell ties back to the creator. Would love someone to prove me wrong here.There is a centralized DNS of sorts... you got me there.. but is this really any different than searching google for onion sites or searching google for freenet sites. You generally find them on the centralized web or some forum like this. Its really just a way to share the sites you create AND lookups are only necessary the first time you view a new site. You dont send requests back to meshedsites.com after that. Even after reboot it looks locally first for your sites and then if its not there then it asks meshedsites.com where to find it. In fact im going to make the DNS configurable in the near future so you can host your own if you like. Im just not there yet. I get the bittorrent sync is not open source. but just cause its not does not  mean there is a tap into the NSA or that all open source software is free of bugs and secure either. I would love for them to open source it. They have been talking about it. But its just not there yet.Is it perfect? no. Do we need to experiment and think about the problems in different ways? Yes. Is there currently an ideal darknet that appeals to both the privacy advocates and the mainstream? No. This projects sole purpose is to bridge privacy and ease of use and make it more palatable to a wider audience.  ,darknetplan,cj7nxto,2,t5_2rju2

2173023,0,t1_clg01sz,Im somewhat skeptical given the lack of technical information on the mesh protocol used the scattering of seeming non sequitur features and the occasional potentially complex feature given as a lineitem. e.g. Video frame interpolation? Does the device have a video output? That doesnt seem to be stated but interpolating frames seems like a technology for a video player matching the refresh rate of a device not a media server. The cloud? Does this mean a file host? Webbased applications hosted on the device? A syncing service? Internet connection sharing? Can you plug in a USB Ethernet device and share multiple wired connections? Is the connection shared with the supposed mesh or only with local clients? Can the mesh extend onto a wired network as well? Can the device handle routing the shared traffic through a VPN balancing between multiple uplinks? Are game networks a feature or is that merely stating that a wireless network can be used for video games? It costs an extra  for the three devices level is configuring multiple devices to work together difficult? File sharing between all units in range would imply its not difficult What is an internet connection mode and which in particular does this device support that would make such support better than an offtheshelf router?Sorry about the wall of text but those are the concerns that hit me from reading the project page while at work.
