Passing Template.myTemplate.events an event map should still do what you want it to.I think the difference is that when you declare your event map it gets sent to jQuerys .on method for binding instead of their homemade global event handling system.Did you figure out the problem?  Mind sharing if you solved it?,Meteor,cglnxi5,2,t5_2twjt

2685696,0,t3_2qs49f,Id suggest building on Wordpress or a more lightweight CMS. Meteor really shines when building small to medium sized applications or when you need realtime capabilities.If you just want to get your feet wet with Meteor Id recommend that you think of a relatively basic idea for a web  mobile app and start there.

3948691,0,t3_35nt8c,Call me a hipster but I use JadeStylusCoffeescript. And for every Meteor project I start I always install those packages first.Why? I am way more efficient with these preprocessors than without them. Here are a few good reasons to use Jade Readability Commentability Modularity Speed of TypingSpeaking of readability its not only much cleaner due to the lack of annoying syntax but you can also fit more code in fewer lines. This reduces scrolling and makes longer pages seem less daunting.Why not Emmet?Well Ive used Emmet but that still only gives you the ability to create HTML really quickly. One of the best things about Jade is its readability and modularity.I can easily comment out an entire block of code by simply adding  behind any tag. Every child is automatically commented out as a result.On Learning JadeAnother commenter mentioned having to look up syntax from time to time. This is basically something that happens whenever you learn anything new. Not just programming but foreign spoken languages new work environments new software etc. This is sometimes called the learning dip and its pretty simple to just push through it.Were not trying to learn Vim here although I am a huge fan but thats another story.,Meteor,cr6dv5e,8,t5_2twjt
4014878,0,t1_crdve4f,Oh okay I didnt notice that I will install it now. When I tried the last time I think there was a script that was asking for root to do something. Is that required or can I skip it and still get meteor working? I will update with what the script does specifically once I can get to my computer and install meteor again.EDIT  The download completes and then it asks to write a launcher script to usrlocalbinmeteor which causes a password prompt that I dont have.  Based on the above comments is this the binary that should be installed in usrlocalbin that allows the meteor command to work properly?,Meteor,crdxd3w,1,t5_2twjt

Otherwise  start at count and then just loop through with an incrementing suffix until you find one that doesnt exist.

7724484,0,t1_d3jtg3d,By all means make mistakes and learn from them.  Its how we all get better at coding.Payment processing is scary because it needs to be scary. A mistake here could very easily land yourself in court or jail. Depending on your countries laws you could be legally and financially responsible for any bank lossesmoney laundering crimes committed through your site.Having said that it sounds like a great project to tackle and I hope you have fun making it.To answer your question you will want to store the end date in the table as a date and use something like moment.js to calculate the time until the project ends client side. Remember that moment will use the clients computer time which may differ from your server. Its always good to store an offset time when your client first connects so you can correct differences when doing a countdown. For processing the project when the time has expired you will want to either schedule a server cron job and run a script periodically or implement a job queuescheduler. You can then add a queued event that will run depending on your business logic when the time has expired There are a few on atmosphere.js an example would be  ,Meteor,d3k7xsa,4,t5_2twjt
