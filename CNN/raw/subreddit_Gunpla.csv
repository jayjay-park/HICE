131767,0,t1_cetfn4y,gt There was a flaw in the dragons!I know. Its silly. The wings of light are a solar sail allowing the Strike Freedom to reach great speeds. Problem is the wings of light are deployed on inside of the wings and the Dragoons are stored on the inside of the wings as well. That means that to activate the wings of light the Dragoons will have to be deployed beforehand. The Strike Freedom has to restrict its own speed to not outpace the Dragoons completely defeating the purpose of the solar sail. Its silly.

778437,0,t3_2329cs,There are plenty of techniques to weathering a kit. A soldering iron Dremel and Hobby Knife will get you nice physical markings. but to add the discoloration and color of exposed metal you will need paint or pigments. The process can be a tad slow as you are using the paints and pigments to build up the damage just like it would accrue naturally. Scratches dust soot rust exposed metal water stains and a whole lot more. All of these are amazing effects that are built up over time. But instead of building it up over several hours or days as it would be in the series you are building it up over a few minutes with some breaks in between.  Ill use one of my recent attempts to explain. here  This is my Ez that Ive been weathering. This might be a little overboard for what you want to achieve since my goal was the derelict EZ after the events of th MST. But your goal will be similar in terms of laying down a foundation. So probably something similar to the first few images in the album. This was all achieved with drybrushing paint on bare plastic and washing on top of the dry brushed paint.   Just like a normal model tanks planes etc. You get what you put into it. It will take a little work to get the effect you want but when its finished you also get the pride of knowing how awesome you are and how awesome your kit is. ,Gunpla,cgsrglv,3,t5_2rlrf

859896,0,t1_ch1kyj9,Theres not much you can do now that theyre already on there  but you can a trim the edges down on the decals to get rid of blank space before you put them on next time.b use some mark softersetter around the edges and see if it slopes the decals edge any to blend it inc take the decals off and order a set of aftermarket waterslide decals for that kit  waterslide decals use a super thin paper so the end result looks closer to a temporary tattoo that you then topcoat to make permanent if that makes any sense. EDIT This is ALL assuming the first topcoat as advised by uPachurick doesnt slope the edges enough to hide it  give it a shot that works most of the time but some stickers are just thick and obvious.,Gunpla,ch20wxv,1,t5_2rlrf

1008272,0,t1_chiuye3,As uBZWingZero pointed out you never really need glue other then on some finicky parts. Coming from Warhammer Ill assume you either want to paint finer details or do a full kit paint job. I recommend since youre newer you do whats called a Snap Fit. Just go ahead and do the assembly sanding and cleaning nubs on the way. Make note of anything that feels like its a bit tight to get together. Once you paint it it will be even tighter.The benefits of the snap for are twofold one you get to see it together and decide what you really want to paint and two you get to see during construction if you might want to modify anything for ascetics or for fit. Once youve figured that out you can disassemble and paint. You dont necessarily have to take the whole thing apart but you can remove the portions you want paint. ,Gunpla,chiwckr,2,t5_2rlrf

1051097,0,t3_2657iz,This is basically the reason why people paint their kits. Pretty much  of the time the plastic around the nub gets discolored and makes it impossible to sand or file off. Painting remedies this by allowing you to get the nub flat and just coloring over it.

2026337,0,t1_ckxdqnn,Its great! I quite like it. Its not as detailed as some might like and theres no frame obviously but its much improved over an NG and I think it bridges the gap between NG and MG well. They cheaped out on a few things for example like how the bipod for the gun cant actually separate into two legs the funnels look ridiculous when they arent mounted and the shieldarm mount is just a giant piece of plastic but otherwise its fine I think. Its clearly a plastic version of the old BClub resin kit but that design has held up reasonably well. Its a bit like the NeoZeong in that its impressive as all hell because of how big it is but theres a lot of blank canvas there if you really want to customize it. It also reminds me a lot of the original MG Sazabi which had a lot of big chunky parts. The lower legs and the shield are almost identical to that kit now that I think about it. Theres tons of undergates and lots of color separation so its easy for anyone to add a ton of presence to their collection in one shot without needing a lot of skill to do it.Overall its not perfect but Im happy with it. Ill have a lot more to say when shes done.,Gunpla,ckxe27x,2,t5_2rlrf

My friend warned me about using Gloss though he said to be careful so i dont make it look to plasticy.

It turned out really nice. kinda jealous PAnd ahh. Do you think you can share some pictures of what the gray looked like on the piece.

2922898,0,t3_2tmho3,Styrene no unless Im doing a lot of fabbing shaping with a Dremel etc. Just denubbing probably produces less dust than your family members do by simply existing. Resin usually wear at least a dust mask sometimes a heavier mask if Ive heavy gating and such to remove. Especially if Im using power tools or an aggressive file. Resin and styrene are different and  resin dust is more of an irritant than the same amount of styrene dust. Neither are going to make you keel over after  seconds exposure. Unless youre respirationcompromised and already taking other precautions the amount of additional dust compared to all the dirt skin flakes bug bits cloth fibers exhaust particulate and everything else youre breathing in is minimal. ,Gunpla,co0cc99,4,t5_2rlrf

I picked it up and it almost split into ! I quickly glued it back to the kit and added some detailing to hide the crack line.. to some success. I still can see it but its a small line now.Thank you.

Avoid dom trooper from the seed series. Not hating on seed or anything but I hear the hand grip is weak and heard some joint problems. Never built one myself but it doesnt have a good reputation.

Its all trial and error and getting to a point where you feel comfortable. If pieces snap or bend it just kind of adds to the process. It sucks Yea.

First of all there are a lot of interesting parts to it some that are downright bizarre. Secondly its a great looking kit even for a high grade. It stands much taller than most other HGs and has a surprising amount of detail with very little work needed to get it to  accurate not to mention it is one of the more offthewall designs as far as gundams go. And thirdly this kit is a panel liners dream. If youre like me and love the detail that panel lines add this one has lines galore and boy do they make a difference! And lastly...

That way you can line and remove the excessmess ups without worrying about ruining your paint job.gtAlso will krylon gray primer be an okay primer to use?Yep. I used it on my first painted unit and it worked out just fine. However I spray painted mine so your results may be slightly different.gtAnd lastly I plan on using Tamiya acrylic paint on the back pack can I just thin it with water and is it okay to panel directly on top of that paint?I would not suggest panel lining directly on top of any paint. Acrylic or Enamel.gtI plan on using testors dull coat as my top coat will that work alright?Should be just fine.My last piece of advice is this Try sticking to one type of paint Enamel or Acrylic.

To folks wondering it is possible to kinda get the titanium look but it seriously just isnt as nice as airbrush or spray can. Mine has a more textured titanium look vs smooth airbrush look because of the primer. Painting large surfaces is very difficult already with regular paint. Doing it with clear colors show everything even more. Hand painting clear blue is a bitch. Red wads itch at first but the layers started to work out much nicer than the others. Yellow started fine and progressively got more difficult to layer. Im re painting a few pieces and I still need to clear coat everything.

You have to thin the paint with whatever base it uses acrylic paints being an exception in that you can use water or isopropyl alcoholalcohol is more recommended of the two.

Generally when you start the build youre super excited and ready to see it through. But the repetition of the process wears you out so by the time the mobile suit itself is assembled you may not feel up to building the weapons.So build the weapons first.

4446976,0,t1_csr0r4y,Yep the Tamiya comes in a couple different size bottles  jars my favorite shop has the bigger ones for an amazing price.  Ive heard that you can use other things to thin it but Ive had really good luck using the  Isopropyl Alcohol the  dos nothing but  is perfect.  Theyre Acrylic Glad I could try and help Ive been hand painting for years but tbh Ive made HUGE leaps in finished product quality since I switched to using Acrylics.  I actually LIKE painting now where I used to dread it DYou definitely want to thin the paints before you apply them.  Theyll go on SO much smoother and easier.  If you dont thin they theres a good chance that youll have brush strokes left behind once things dry and the finished project may also look goopey and thick.  The thinned paints will flow into the crevices on the parts so youll still have the molded detail visible when youre done   I didnt prime initially I thought it was too much of a hassle but truthfully it DOES help things.  I even found a primer that I can brush on and I can thin it with the same  Isopropyl Alcohol that I use with the Tamiya paints!  ,Gunpla,csr870n,1,t5_2rlrf

Ive just been into the hobby for like  or so years now damn I feel old..LOL So I have some decent knowledge of kits and average knowledge of GunPla kits and the construction process. Good luck with the MG Wing Gundam Proto Zero EW if you do end up getting it. And while youre at it you should also pick up the MG Epyon EW and have the  on like Action Base s fighting.. ,Gunpla,ctq6s7g,1,t5_2rlrf
4728905,0,t3_3fozbs,I havent built the kit personally but after reviewing some pictures on dalong. The kit actually looks very good in terms of articulation and appearance. Ive heard nothing but great things about the thunderbolt series so I would say go for it!!!,Gunpla,ctqmaxq,1,t5_2rlrf

4759825,0,t1_ctugo6g,I wouldnt necessarily say severely lacking but the differences are comparable to that of your standard High Grade vs a Master Grade. Theres no inner frame so theres no slidingarmor gimmicks like on the MG Astrays and the construction is overall much simpler which results in less articulation and agility compared to the MGs. For example the MG Astray shoulders are each composed of several small parts that ultimately offer a respectable range of motion and detail while the NG Gold Frame  shoulders are Im assuming here since I havent personally built one molded as one piece. Additionally the NG hands are not posable as they are frozen in the onegripfitsall hand typical of older HGs and there is heavy use of decals in places where were the Gold Frame Amatsu a Master Grade there would be separate pieces molded in the proper color.  And this is my own opinion so a pinch of salt should go with it the highgloss plastic the Amatsu is cast in is hard and brittle which makes the model feel fragile and almost cheap in my hands.  If you want a Gold Frame your best bet is indeed a No Grade since there isnt a proper Master Grade but while the OOB model is alright it will need some extra detailing to look really stellar. Another option is to just get a MG RedBlue Frame and paint it gold Overall if youre okay with High Grade kits and dont mind needing additional detailing the NG Gold Frame can look pretty darn sharp on a shelf. ,Gunpla,ctuirtc,1,t5_2rlrf
4761603,0,t3_3g43w1,Great Job!  I notice on some of the pieces either the gold went on a little to thick or something didnt interact well with the gold.  Usually a good cleaning putting the pieces in dishwasher soapy water overnight then wiping clean will remove this.  But other wise great job! I am currently redesigning my website but I would love to show off the kit in the custom gunpla from around the net section when its back up! D. ,Gunpla,ctuqt5y,4,t5_2rlrf
4769556,0,t3_3g2c1z,Personally speaking a lot of why I havent done much advanced gunplay stuff is indeed fear. Ive been unemployed for some time and Ive scrimped and saved for every kit or upgrade Ive bought if I hopelessly screw a major part up beyond my ability to fix it I havent been able to afford to replace it. Its not laziness.  Having just taken a lot of time and care to build fully paint and upgrade a PG Full Armor Unicorn with an LED set in it I take GREAT exception to anyone calling me lazy because I might have missed a few nubs on it somewhere.  I do now have a job and I am really looking forward to upping my level of competency. Yay!  I recently saw a post where someone here had built a lovely model really nicely painted up and it looked lovely. However the first comment I saw was someone proudly proclaiming they were downvoting it because the builder hadnt removed nub marks on the hands. Do we really want such blunt negative frankly unhelpful and downright rude comments? Nope. So why the hell would I want to read them in a magazine?  I am extremely glad I skimmed through the magazine before I settled down to read it properly it meant I got to see all the cool stuff in there and made up my mind to read it properly before I read the article in question. I found the points made in it to be very interesting but the way it was written put me off immensely. While I do agree with some of the article there was no need to phrase it in such a twatty elitist way. All that does is get peoples backs up.,Gunpla,ctvquz7,1,t5_2rlrf

4827726,0,t3_3gyo6u,I dont know whats not to love in Gunpla.

4837855,0,t3_3h5c13,This is being a nightmare to build.The model itself is wonderful probably my favorite build so far but it is different from my previous models modern gunpla in subtle ways that are proving disastrous. First of all articulations are extremely tight. Second the inner frame is ABS plastic. The tight articulations mean scratches but thankfully they are for now limited to the transformation that I dont plan to do. the ABS plastic means the leg inner frame is breaking in multiple place been fixing it with plaplate since I didnt precoat the pieces before priming lesson learnt and the lacquer thinner in my primer attacked the plastic. For the arms I did do a precoat of Alclad aqua gloss and it solved the issue.Moreover the weathering technique Im using is heavily reliant on strong washes and Im using enamel. But I didnt bother painting every single piece by itself some of them I painted together but without gluing them  mistake or making sure the gloss coat covered everything even the back of the piece. So I had some bare plastic in the interior and some washes got through to the bare plastic resulting in more brittle plastic and yet more broken pieces.The tight fit in the articulations contributes to this problem. Theres more inner tension and things snap.Im happy with the look Im getting still much to do this is only preliminary chipping plus decals in part of the armor. I still need to do washesstreaksdirt. Plus weapons packpack and cockpit and pilot but man its been stressful. ,Gunpla,cu4clqf,2,t5_2rlrf
4841647,0,t3_3h6zsq,Be sure that when you are pressing on the spray nozzle you are pressing all the way. Really press on that sucker. Look at this video and observe how close he is and the method he sprays on the top coat.One of the inherent problems of spraycan top coat is the lack of control you have. If the first spurt of paint is bad all succeeding layers will reflect that and just pile on. You have to commit from the start and have a firm grasp on the air can. Optimal performance is achieved by testing first on a spoon during each session to get an idea of how the can is reacting and what needs adjustment. This ofcourse is costly. ,Gunpla,cu4ts1u,3,t5_2rlrf

5240864,0,t3_3mseq9,Hey all!This is my first build and I used it as a testing ground for a variety of things from sprue cutting and shaving to panel lining to to a bit of marker work where I thought it might look better than the provided stickers.It came out a bit of a mess. Ill start with the spaulders. They came with big white stickers for the bottom two feathers. I didnt like the look of them thought theyd crinkle so I used a white Gundam Marker on them. They didnt dry very flat and I did use some very fine sand paper to even that out but even after a couple layers of Dullcoat I think ol Sandys got shoulders only a dad can love.I also messed up the right left in photos shin pretty badly. It was the first piece that I cut out and the sprue marks were horrendous. I cut way too close to the plastic and it left some marks well below the surface. Again I tried to buff them out but it ended up leaving a lot of imperfections.On the same leg along the seams youll also see a lot of black. Thats not me trying to panel line the seams I promise! It was me trying my hand at different markers for panel lining before my Gundam Markers arrived and the fallout from trying to clean them off with a variety of solvents.I also had a pretty bad screwup not pictured when I first applied Dullcoat. I lingered too long over one of the blades and it bled GM pretty badly along the surface of the blade. That did buff out to some extent and I relined that part before the second layer of Dullcoat.So after laying my heart bare what am I happy with? Generally the lining. Although there are a few glaring mistakes there I think I did a fair job all things considered. Im also pretty happy with the head. I forwent the red stickers on the chin and at the midpoint of the antenna for GM and along with the lining on the head it all turned out really nice after a coat of matte.So again probably only a build a dad could love overall but I wanted to share. Partially because over the past week Ive shared some of my foibles with some other beginners in the sub and partially because I have a lovely Chars Zaku RG sitting on the workbench that Im aching to dig into and Id love to have this piece to look back on and say thats where I learned the super basics.So heres to the beginning of a new hobby for myself and a messy introduction.Also I promise better lighting next time!,Gunpla,cvhppry,2,t5_2rlrf

If the HiNu had been released all on its own without the Nu having ever come out I am sure people would be praising it as the best MG kit ever made barring Sazabi. Thats because the Nu came along and introduced so many new innovations which we took for granted as standard by the time the HiNu rolled around.Between the two the HiNu is actually easier to build and I think better presence as well what with the funnel wings and enormous legs. The Nu has the crippling issue of not being able to hold all its funnels very securely but I guess thats easily remedied with some duct tape or a metal rod. I will also say it has the more interesting inner frame but as an overall display piece the HiNu commands more attention.,Gunpla,cxncxpy,1,t5_2rlrf

6067160,0,t1_cyeviz9,gt It just seems odd that people are super opinionated on this specific instance when in the larger modeling community its almost a nonissue.I believe its a very different case Gunpla and its bootlegs are very much tied with an IP that BandaiSunrise have fostered. With the general modelling community I seem to see more on the militaryaircraft end and thus those companies have better things to do than come down on companies who arent even interfering with their main industry which would be weaponsaerotech.When we look at the fictional kits however like Star wars Star Trek Battlestar Galactica and so on there are known legal implications when you want to produce models for them. Some are more open than others if I recall Warhammer are rather lenient with smaller companies making kits while as many know Disney cracked down on the licenses to sell Star Wars kits just recently. The scale modelling scene in the West is a lot smaller and niche. Correct me if Im wrong but having stayed in a few western countries modelling shops are few and far in between and many of them focus on a variety of hobbies to survive. There isnt nearly as much promoting or a presence like in Japan. Not to mention Gunpla is VERY big in many Asian countries so theyre looking at a much bigger scale than any company has to deal with in the western audience. Lastly I dont think Bandai themselves are too adamant on completely destroying bootleg companies. I havent heard of anything like Bandai going to lengths to sue and stop bootlegs. From what Ive gathered on forums and people Japan in general just isnt that rigid when it comes to cracking down on third party products. Rather they would just like to curb the purchasing of third party kits.Personally Im against bootlegs for the reasons that much of them DO use aspects from official kits. Designs well thats the biggest issue. As with DMs new MG Destiny people at Robot Damashii have worked extremely hard to renew the Destinys looks but their efforts are only being stolen by DM. Mechanics Im not  sure but it definitely looks like this PG Unicorn will be quite similar to Bandais PG Unicorn. All the proportions and joints that I can see are similar and I mean it DID come out after the official kit and not before. There might be added gimmicks or refined areas from the official kit but again not cool that Bandais engineers efforts are going to be unrewarded.,Gunpla,cyew8w4,3,t5_2rlrf

Color brand paints along with their leveling thinner. Always get a perfectly smooth paint job. I also just started using tamiya accent color and really like it for panel lining.

6453891,0,t1_czmku8n,I wish they would overhaul the Zaku to todays standards.  The joints on the Unicorn are stiff which is good since it means that it can hold poses and the guns rather well.  The joints on the Zaku needed to have screws to reinforce the joints or they wouldnt hold on their own.  Even with screws in the joints the joints were a little loose but that also because you dont wanna overtighten it and run the risk of cracking the plastic.The nub marks on the Unicorn are easier to hide since the suit is mostly white and the parts are undergrated.  The nub marks on the Zaku couldnt be hidden without being painted.  I didnt paint mine so you can actually see the marks throughout the kit.

I personally use a DS stylus and you can pick these up super cheap at Walmart or any dollar store. In desperate situation Ive use a coin or even my nail and everything worked out fine. rub across the decal with a modest amount of pressure and youll start to see the decal transfer When you feel like its done SLOWLY peel off the tape if you see it hasnt transfer all the way lay it back down and go over the parts that didnt transfer Once youre done make sure to top coat or else they can scratch or rub offAlso if your waterslides are not coming off theyre probably not waterslides. Try peeling them off like stickers and see. Waterslides usually do not have defined edges around them like stickers.I dont believe the Epyon came with waterslides.

It was quite an achievement when it was announced years back. With HGs you can make the external details comparable to RG kits  that is if you have enough skills which most people dont. However you cannot easily replicate the armor movements presented in RGs. Most builders dont even care to do it.The stickers are not bad at all if you use tweezers.  of them are nicely cut. The other odd  can be easily trimmed with a sharp hobby knife. I like marking on my kits so these decals are a plus. Not a big fan of those shiny bits though.Im not convincing you to love RG kits.

7081211,0,t3_4cj8or,if you are serious on painting gunpla. It is a wise investment to save up for Airbrush and good compressor. The cost of HOBBY GRADE spray paint really add up very quick.As for the topic I am suggesting the following. Paint Regular spray can at your hardware store will work for MG might be challenging for RG but doable. This will work with enough practice on how to use it. Remember Normal spray cans spit more paint and without Control it is easy to overspray and flood the details of the kit. I am from Philippines I use both TamiyaMR product as well as normal spray can like Bosny.. Weathering Kit go to your nearest ART store and look for chalk pastel or soft pastel as long as it is NOT oil pastel just pick the color you want. Just use a hobby knife and grind the chalk so that it will produce powder and then you can use it to weather your kit. For applicator you can use any make up applicator available in the cosmetic area of general stores or you can use sponge as well. Both weathering kit and this method requires flat semi flat or satin finish and needs to be sealed so that it wont get removed by constant touchingHeck you can even use Pencil lead for weathering just make it a powder by grinding a hobby knife similar to what I mentioned above.,Gunpla,d1j0qoc,1,t5_2rlrf

Well its a rd party...After literal decades if I was Bandai I wouldnt be risky neither. Specially when some of the buyers are actually kids and also having to complish a quality standard. Every kit you could consider bad from Bandai right now is due to being very aged bit lazyness and hurry making sure you get along the actual show being retransmitted see HG SEED and HG kits and the special case of the MG The O according to what I heard.EDIT I remembered the first run of the HGUC Zeta Plus got a molding issue in certain head pieces and they had to fix it.

7486154,0,t1_d2t0fsv,Ran into that problem again trying to extend the skirt armor on the space jahannam. I think it has to do with how long the putty sits on the plastic before drying.

7555994,0,t1_d312297,Thanks! For the LED Thrusters you can follow this tutorial  The basic idea is you want the positive lead on the LED to touch the thruster and the negative lead to touch the batteries.  When you screw in the top of the thruster it makes contact with the body and this makes a connection between the positive end of the battery with the positive lead on the LED.  This completes the circuit and turns on the LED.  So when you cut it you want the positive lead to be long enough to touch the thruster and you want the negative lead to be long enough so that the batteries dont touch the positive lead.  The battery cover will prevent the battery from making contact with the metal thruster.I drew up a quick picture in paint that should help along with the video.For the head its a bit more complicated.  Just follow the instructions in the manual or the video to solder the wires in the right place and just put them in the head.  The thing that makes it hard is that the whole circuit is so tiny and its really easy to accidentally tear the wires.  I actually messed up the circuit so bad  I had to throw away the switch and wires.I ended up doing this setup where i just stuffed the LED into the head and wrapped the leads around.  And when I want to turn it on I simply just push down the positive lead to make contact with the batteries.  Not the most elegant solution but it works.  Hope that helps! and let me know if you need more clarification on something,Gunpla,d312wf2,2,t5_2rlrf

Also if it will include scrapped parts and exposed inner frame then MG is the way to go.  If youre planning scenes with multiple kits then probably go with HGs.Id say RGs are great for straight builds or color swaps because of the partcolor separation that goes in the design.  ,Gunpla,d3xntu3,1,t5_2rlrf
7843405,0,t1_d3xnbd2,The most difficult thing about this kit was that many of the places where pieces connect are right down the middle where they are readily visible and unsightly.  If you look at the thigh plates for instance in the P Bandai version they dont connect down the center but they do with this kit.  I used Tamiya putty and Testors Model Master Liquid cement to fill it in.  Same goes for the forearms lower legs feet rockets gun everything.  Be prepared to do a bit of work to get it looking smooth.Finally though it requires a bit of painting.  As youve seen the shield is just white when built out of the box and the decals arent the greatest.  Overall I had a lot of fun working on this piece and it will enjoy a nice spot in the display case but it does show its age a bit.

It came in only one color basic grey and NEEDS cement to put the parts together. I went with a Gold Leaf for the armor and Dark Sea Gray for the rest of the suit. I wanted to add a contrast and the alternative would be orange mixed with black to make it darker. I didnt want to buy extra paints and had to choose from  or  shades of grey. I used an airbrush and Tamiya colors.The build itself is not hard except for parts falling off all the time. I had to cement the pipes on the side two times before they finally sticked to the body.

8070697,0,t3_4poujn,Fully articulated hands like those from the . Nu Szabi etc. are very expressive and can hold weapons well however they often have problem the the weak wrist joint. If you are trying to make your kit hold a heavy weapon chances that over time or if you pose too much the wrist will be come loose and droop down.Swappable fingers is the kind that I prefer. They are very expressive and stable with a trade off of moveable fingers. They can hold weapon very securely and often have a pretty good wrist joint. The only downside is you are limited to the fingers Bandai gives you.. hands are the ones with movable knuckles amp second digits. These hands have very shallow peg. They arent friendly with largeheavy weapons.The older three finger trigger finger split with no peg are terrible for large weapons. Without some modifications you will likely spend some good amount of time trying to make it hold a large weapon.The fully articulated hands are designed for UC suits which is too large on  Seed and smaller Wing kits. The articulated RG hands IMO are terrible and a fair but fail attempt from Bandai side. I always prefer the included static hands or the  MS Hands on RG kits.,Gunpla,d4n819f,1,t5_2rlrf

8096833,0,t3_4q4s7i,Well I really enjoyed building my RX Origin variant.  Syd over at gaijingunpla.com has the Sword Impluse as his highest rated MG kit.There is a bit of a split between the subreddit about what grade to start on.  Some say HGs some say MGs.  I started on MGs myself with the Destiny Gundam and I would say the bigger parts are easier to work with and the inner frames arent super complicated especially on the newer kits.  Ver Katoki kits can be a bit overwhelming especially with the amount of stickers and markings included.  Overall I would say take a look over at gaijingunpla since Syd documents a lot of his builds and does a good job of breaking down pros and cons of each kit.,Gunpla,d4q5nnt,1,t5_2rlrf

8140503,0,t3_4qqlm9,You can try spraying a few layers of clear gloss over the clea orange layer and see how you like that.  For candy paint jobs the base layer is very important any bumps in the surface ruins the effect.  Always use a glossy black base.  The gold needs to be fairly glossy too or the grains in that will mess with the candy effect and you get a dull tone.  You can try alclad polished brass instead of the gold you used and that may be shiny enough for the orange.As for yellow.  You can always prime in grey then shade with white.  Then paint the yellow over the white.  If you use clear yellows over the white youll get a very bright yellow.Experiment on some plastic spoons.  Then you when you find your desired combo go to the kit.  Beats having to strip the kit and start over.... which looks like its the best option.  ,Gunpla,d4v3wv0,1,t5_2rlrf

8550476,0,t1_d69ljfg,most of my painting clips are in use for my  kimaris but i am waiting one some gold paint i ran out. as for painting well for a full paint job you need to let it cure for at least  days. i could have panel lined it but i plan on painting it so it would have been wasted.i started out with that technique for clean up so i say from experiences that there are some drawbacks using that technique mainly you run the risk of gouging the plastic. That why I stopped using it and switched to sanding. As for using jewelry nippers cant say much about them as I have never used one. however the down side to using a cheap hobby nipper is you get what you pay for. i have used cheap ones and the spring they use tends to break easily but like I said i have never used one. this may be  bucks but it is worth it.,Gunpla,d6adr87,1,t5_2rlrf

First I want to create sort of like a block piece for the gap in the back of this image the portion where the original back unit piece goes for  Impulse.  The block piece I want to make it be able to be inter changeable with the original back part that goes there cause the backpack unit I want to use dark matter booster sticks out too much for my taste if I use the original piece in there. The block piece I want to make will have a hole to be able to fit a simple peg and hole back pack unit. So what would I have to do to make a piece that can be taken in and out for that portion? Next question I have some green stuff here at home I want to make a few modifications to a  head piece is it ok to apply green stuff directly on top of the piece or do I mold the parts I want and then apply it on?,Gunpla,d79pa3y,1,t5_2rlrf

8945443,0,t1_d7n3g10,The great thing about tamiya sprays are that theyre smaller so theyre easier to handle and their colors are super saturated so you dont need as many coats to get the same depth of color as you would with krylon.

8958973,0,t3_52y2ez,There is absolutely no reason to get MG Unicorn Ver Ka. It has very limited knee and wasit articulation. The head vulcans is absent in ver ka.The OVA ver is an improved version. It doesnt have a huge amount of decals like Ver Ka does but you can easily get the ver ka decal sheet from third party. The OVA also comes with light blue beam saber effect parts instead of pink in Ver Ka. The MG with MS Cage is basically an OVA version with a very slightly warmer white. The rest is identical to OVA.MG FA Unicorn is a ver ka with fixed knee articulation  head vulcans are still absent...and of course comes with a boat load of weapons. ,Gunpla,d7oqg48,3,t5_2rlrf
8959162,0,t1_d7nlosu,Agree and disagree on this.It is true that matte coat on shinymetallic stickers will make them duller although this could be an attractive effect as the dull makes them look blend in with the kit rather than shiny amp stand out like a toy  its personal preference so do however you like You should however apply all the clear marking decals first and matte coat them leave the shiny ones after. This will do two things. Matte coat will make sticker edges less visible.. Top coat of any finish will help sealing those stickers in and dont peel off over time  especially on curve surfaces.As for the clear parts leave them off until you finish all the top coating then put them back in place.That is how I did with my RG Q.,Gunpla,d7or9i3,2,t5_2rlrf
8961862,0,t3_52wz0o,Really really nice work! I know that kind of weathering takes a good amount of patience. I think whats great is even if that texture that developed on the blue wasnt intentional it still fits with the narrative of the weathering!My only minor critiques would be that in general i think the streaking is a little too consistent as every chip of a certain size has approximately the same size streak of rust.lastly i think the metallics seem a little too grungy in spotsmay be caused by the topcoat and tend to break up the forms when you zoom in this paired with the chipping makes things look busy up close.But thats it! just my couple of nitpicks for next time overall this is one top notch build!,Gunpla,d7p2xem,2,t5_2rlrf

8968801,0,t3_52zc4y,What Id recommend trying is buying some oil paints. Brown. Black. Orange is really all you need. Cover the whole model in black then try wipe it off with a cloth. What this does is leave black in the cracks and hard to reach places. Keep adding more and more layers of black. Brown. Orange. Whipping off in between each layer. This will give dimension and make it look more realistic. When doing this to flat surfaces try to be as random as possible when wiping off your paint. This is the same technique that hollywood prop builders use when making props look weathered. The only Down side is oil paints take  days to dry using this method. But the results are stunning and is relativly easy. ,Gunpla,d7pwx1o,1,t5_2rlrf

9385507,0,t1_d94kz5x,Ok Ill try to describe this but it may be confusing. The age fxs shoulders are flat or mostly flat on the surface that goes up against the torsothe inside of the shoulder. If you file that flat then glue a sheet of styrene over it the connection hole will be covered. The edges of the sheet will stick out on all sides of the shoulder but after the glue dries you can file them down so they are flush with the shoulder armor. By doing this you have basically extruded the surface of the shoulder armor that connects to the torso and covered the hole. Repeat the process with a second sheet of styrene for extra strength. Now you have to cut off a piece of runner and file one end to fit the polycap on the Quant. Drill a hole in the newly created surface of the shoulder armor using an exacto blade this will cause the size to increase slowly test fit the peg periodically until it goes in then glue the peg in. You can now connect the parts. If that was confusing let me know I will make a diagram.,Gunpla,d95og97,1,t5_2rlrf

9455004,0,t3_5a8hza,Its a nice custom but you need to thin your paints more.  I would also recommend using a retarder as well which will lengthen the drying time.  This allows the brush strokes to settle out.Remember hand painting is not like the airbrushing you usually see around here.  It takes many light and thin coats to get good coverage of color without losing a smooth appearance.,Gunpla,d9ehlz3,4,t5_2rlrf

9509331,0,t3_5b2bt8,It happens. The primer may not have bonded well to that particular area. You might want to sand down the piece to a moderate grit level and not buff it before priming to help with the primer sticking to the plastic.It also helps if you only apply the tape lightly dont press down too hard when applying it so that it doesnt adhere too wel to the painted surface.Also try peeling the tape slowly when done.,Gunpla,d9l86p4,2,t5_2rlrf

9533943,0,t1_d8uoxwl,The nubs arent so bad Ive found. The brittle plastic is more prone to snapping I agree. Just have to be gentle snapping pieces together. Ive not built a full HG clear kit with standard nubs but on SDs the nubs can be cleaned up with a hobby knife. With a sharp enough knife you can shave it down and remove the discoloration. Has worked well for me. I tend to use a real touch marker to match the color or close enough on stubborn white spots. Hides it quite well. At least from the standard shelf viewing. Up close you can still sorta spot them. Goodguydan has a great tutorial for more advanced cleaning methods for clear plastic. Highly recommend if youve got problem pieces.  ,Gunpla,d9o9akg,1,t5_2rlrf

9660257,0,t3_5de0qq,I started about a month ago and I already have a big backlog of things. Birthday came around and had some friends and family buy me some also.  Things Ive learned are that sanding is pretty bad and gets in your throat and you end up coughing up loogies. I just use a mask now. Ive learned to use the blade to scrape off left over nubs instead of sanding all the time. Still learning how to cleanly pull off the hard clear plastics off the runners without stress marks. It still takes time to use a blade to clean them off without leaving the white.  It takes a lot longer to build than I expected between doing adult things and hobbies. I see why people take their time as its relaxing and stressful at the same time. I have not started panel lining yet but I have the markers.

No idea how much Bandai values their molds at but hed bought molds upwards of  and sometimes as high as . The thing about molds is they last an extremely long time as long as theyre made right. Ive heard a couple numbers being thrown around but its generally guaranteed that the mold will last over  cycles and in one case a company guaranteed a mold for the product life of the part being made.

10025152,0,t3_5j8s0v,A You really shouldnt be spraying laquer paints into that booth. They dont have explosion proof brushless motors for the fan and it is a fire hazard to spray such a flammable paint into it.B You arent going to get rid of laquer smell with anything short of an industrial booth. Especially at the volume a can sprays. I think you will always have a considerable amount of stink trying to use a laquer indoors. But the only thing I can recommend is making sure the booth is closed afterwards. I made a shitty flap out of duct tape and carboards for mine but I use acrylic out of an airbrush so there is a large difference there.If you want to spray laquer do it outdoors. Youre probably hurting yourself being in all those fumes for any amount of time.,Gunpla,dbeazu6,1,t5_2rlrf

10110409,0,t3_5kmxty,This this was my first year of building gunpla I started watching IBO on the plane home from uni in January and ended up buying a Graze for my birthday. I built nine kits and it was honestly so much fun not pictured a Tallgeese  EW which I was unprepared to paint which will stay in a box until I can make it look good. My favourites are the Graze the Sazabi SD and the Kampfer. The Sazabi is my favourite MS but the Kampfer wins because its an amazing HG kit.I ended up watching IBO build fighters twice the original anime  the Origin Unicorn the th Ms team and am currently midway through Zeta. My high was seeing the Sazabi and Hi Nu built panel lined and standing together in battle. The low was building the Tallgeese and not being able to do anything with it.I dont exactly have many hopes for new kits Id love to see the  gundams get reborn kits especially the Dynames and its successors. And I would really like to see build fighters get a new season so we can get more cool redone kits also its one of the main reasons I began building gunpla so Id like to see more content.My goal for next year is to start building more complex gunpla some MG models like the Delta Plus Tallgeese I time to do it right! and the RE Bawoo are probably my first picks. But the model I really want to build is the Sazabi Ver Ka. It looks like an amazing build and everyone who posts it here says its really fun to build. But Im going to hold off until I can do it without worrying about messing it up plus I want to be able to paint the inner frame like people on here have done. I also want to finish customising my Graze so far its been given the Tallgeeses rifle and shield aiming to one day paint it and make it a custom. Also Im hoping Ill be able to afford more gunpla as they are too much fun to only be able build a few in the year.I really like the community here everyone is so creative and positive it really makes me love the hobby! Happy New Year everyone!,Gunpla,dbpeaco,3,t5_2rlrf

10120939,0,t3_5ksnif, RG Chars ZGok is an incredibly unique and fun build the details and articulation are great!  I often pose mine in a handstand just because I can.  Only downside is that there are no accessories  what you see is what you get but what you get is an amazing RG. HG  Gundam Type ACD is a cheap and gorgeous HG.  The colour separation and articulation are unbelievable the only stickers you use are for the eyes and GN Drive.  I love posing this guy and he always looks great on display. HG HyGogg is an interesting kit.  Its good but not great as its old and has loose parts but its still one of my favourites because of its design fun posing options you get with those crazy arms and its potential!  An important note about this kit is that it is in my opinion the perfect kit to practice modifications and painting on.  It has large surfaces for adding detail easily removed seamlines pinvise opportunities legs and shoulders mostly and a slight innerframe to detail in the arms. EDIT Typo,Gunpla,dbqrkmz,1,t5_2rlrf

I heard someone say once that you didnt need to with Testors because they were already thinned but I would like to get a nd opinion on this.  I had also heard that you could thin it with water instead of the Testor brand thinner they sell. Is there a way I can find a color mixing guide?  I have a few basic colors and I wanted to paint my MG Gelgoog in the Cima Garahaus colors.  I could probably get the light purple down with some purple  white but the YellowGold color is a bit trickier for me to figure out and I dont want to waste too much paint on trial and error.,Gunpla,dbv1qqe,1,t5_2rlrf

Although Id honestly advise if youre looking for a handbrushable gloss acrylic go with Vallejo gloss varnish thinned with their thinner at a  varnishthinner ratio.

10939591,0,t3_5w85jh,I recently bought their Type F Sandrock and Altron conversions but I havent recieved them yet. I think I bought a   ZII conversion recast from them and it was a pretty great kit. Resin kits are different from plastic kits in a few ways Casts are usually imperfect. Expect to see bubbles excessive flash warped parts etc. Usually nothing shaving or drilling wont fix. Some detail may need to be rescribed. Conversion kits usually have some parts that will snap into place but some will have to be pinned with brass rods. Fitting is usually loose so it is a good idea to glue all the resin pieces in. Working with resin involves a lot of drilling and sanding which leaves a lot of dust. Resin dust is actually pretty bad for you so use a respirator and wet sand in a well ventilated area whenever possible.  Resin is heavier and more brittle than regular plastic. Not usually a problem but its something to keep in mind with some kits.Overall if you are comfortable doing full painted builds on plastic kits resin isnt a huge leap in difficulty. It just takes more time and patience. ,Gunpla,de8cblp,3,t5_2rlrf

It also gives you a good idea about how to think about posing which are very helpful. LightningAce for fantastic examples. Replicating his poses even for different kits than the ones shown is great practice and a source of ideas.The two usually posted These which some have pointed out are actually a Robot Damashii. Theyre basically action figures and specifically designed to be very posable. When working on your own gunpla keep in mind that every gunpla doesnt have the same range of motion and some poses might be genuinely impossible for them to make. And this picture which is probably posted the most. Its useful but fairly simple. Youll probably want to do more than just stand your kits in the long run.Enjoy!,Gunpla,dfjrqh0,4,t5_2rlrf

11446293,0,t3_63bt1v,For the white marks there are two things to help. Make two cuts with your nippers  one about halfway down the gate the plastic between the round parts of the runner and the actual part to free it from the runner then a second cut with the nippers flush against the part.  Ive been doing this recently and while you have to make more cuts the amount of cleanup you have to do is minmal to none.  I started doing this halfway through my MG Jesta because that black plastic was nub mark city and the results were night and day.  HOWEVER if you have crap nippers then you may run into the same problem soooooo..... BUY GOOD TOOLS!  You dont need to go out and buy the fabled SPN nippers but I would seriously recommend these  GodHand GN  They are far and away the best nippers I have used for the price.  They cut nicely hold their edge well and on the lighter color plastics I can get cuts that need no cleanup at all with them.  Much better than the ones youll get at the local hobby lobby!  For Xactos Ive started using their Zseries blades and they too have made my gunpla a lot better looking than whatever old ones I was using before I went tool shopping.

How do I fix loose joints and other pieces that have trouble staying put together? The left arm is particularly loose and falls out a lot but some parts of the waist are fairly loose too. Are there any nonglue methods to fixing this? When watching a fast build of this kit I saw the builder cut the front skirt piece into two despite the instructions not saying to do that.

11680453,0,t3_66nn2f,gt theyre placed in places they could have just easily used plastic forBandai could have done it but they chose not to. Why? Because its an HG. Save the better color separationdetails for RG. As for painting you will need to spend some time masking the areas. Alternatively you can hand paint.

The weathering and lack of proper light box make it hard to see in the pics though.Tamiya NATO Black for majority of armorTamiya German Grey for other pieces of armorGundam Marker Metallic Red for the accentsTamiya Rubber Black for the weapons main colorTamiya Gunmetal for the frame and weapon accentsTamiya Chrome Silver for thrustersTamiya Flat Aluminum for the sword blade edge and overall weatheringI also used oil stain soot burnt blue and rust from the Tamiya weathering kits.,Gunpla,dgkn75c,3,t5_2rlrf

11749740,0,t1_dgr43lb,Look. They made the MG Banshee Norn pbandai and the MG Phenex a normal release. The Norn is wildly more popular than Phenex and pBandai is supposedly for things they dont see selling big full retail and the Phenex is much more obscure from a single short film shown at GTF. If anything it would make more sense if these two were reversed but thats Bandai for yah. Point is pbandai is whatever the hell they want it to be and I would bet Rozen Zulu is going to be no different when Bandai decides on whether or not this is pbandai. ,Gunpla,dgrv23s,2,t5_2rlrf

11776394,0,t3_680fzz,The Gundam wiki has most if not all releases ever recorded in history but Dalongs is what I recommend despite the fact its in korean as its more easier to traverse has a better interface and even comes with useful picture reviews.

11796406,0,t1_dgx5f3h,SEED is really only unpopular outside of Japan. In Japan its one of the highest rated Gundam series and the Freedom usually ranks  or  on favorite MS polls. It makes sense for Bandai to want to keep making kits based on SEED seeing as how it sells better than most other shows.As for a truly unpopular series Age is generally considered the worst of the worst Ive seen it and I hated it but I still thought Destiny The sequel to SEED was worse but it came pretty close to being as bad as Destiny IMO. Reconguista In G is also unpopular but I havent seen it so I have no opinion on it I do quite like the MS designs though.At the end of the day we shouldnt be judging shows because of popularity. We should all have our own opinions. Many Gundam fans love  I however thought it was bordering on mediocre mostly for the same reasons why I found SEED mediocre IMO mediocre is the thin line between good and bad.,Gunpla,dgx5vdx,16,t5_2rlrf
