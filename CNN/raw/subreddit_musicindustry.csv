3785394,0,t3_33ohd4,That reads like one long advert to me.gtWhy most artists statements from their distributors fall below this range is because mechanical and performance royalties arent paid to the distributor.Why? What distributor? ,musicindustry,cqnrj5p,1,t5_2safw

9849177,0,t1_daqxzhz,Thanks for sharing your experiences and btw I did read everything you wrote! Im thinking of maybe going into biology its somewhat interesting to me and according to my mom it is and will be a high demand job. I would still like to go into a job that relates to music but still makes a good income for the backup career. Managing probably wouldnt suit me as I dont think I could handle organizing different events and such. Going into jobs that involve making websites wouldnt be thing either. Not exactly sure yet what I should do though. Going to book an appointment with my guidance counselor at school to talk about it. If I were to go into music at university as a minor then unfortunately my parents wouldnt pay for the tuition and so I would have to get a student loan. But my major not related to art would be supported financially in terms of tuition by my parents.,musicindustry,dardcpq,1,t5_2safw

I think it would be possible but you would have to have two or three residencies and be able to produce a lot of merchandise worth selling. but if you dont want to travel being a cover musician is probably the way ,musicindustry,dbrpzlp,1,t5_2safw
10258365,0,t1_dc6jn3p,Also do you know if there is some sort of repository or website where I can find all the internships in the music industry that are offered? Sites like Indeed and LinkedIn dont always list everything that is available.Also you mentioned a management company do you know anything in particular?,musicindustry,dc6ubrk,1,t5_2safw
