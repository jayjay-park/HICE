6471699,0,t3_449mno,Double Dark Hole  Raigeki  x Fog King are pretty standard.  Extra copies of Majestys fiend is also normal.  Breakthrough skill can be sided as well for the mirror or decks that can consistently make naturia beast especially since the meta is drifting away from Pepe towards Kozmos Monarchs Atlanteans Infernoids and Burning Abyss.  Twin Twisters are a must as well. Battle Fader is useful against KozmosMagicians,Monarchs,czopwkh,1,t5_2wocf

7655720,0,t1_d397lhw,Hi! Sorry for not answering really busy with real life stuff lol. Okay lets see.First of all the RotA. At this point Id say you should test and find what build are you comfortable with but from a personal viewpoint cutting either Escalation or Return as these are searchable is the ideal option. However having a card at  means they are pretty vulnerable to backrow its hard to recycle them from the Graveyard and youll need to first banish them then use Edea. Another option is to cut Domain or Prime which are more important but at of so they wont suffer that much.Well Chaos Sorcerer is literally a weaker Black Luster Soldier  Envoy of the Beginning. And all your Light and Dark monsters except Ehther are important in your Graveyard on their own Edea is revived by Eidos Eidos revives Edea Erebus recycles any Monarch. BLS can be a tech yeah but its not that great because its a consistency hit as it doesnt turn on your engine.Turning your engine on is basically succesfully summoning an important Monarch ErebusEhther to the field they allow you to dump Pantheism and Prime alongside with a continuous card another Monarch in your hand and either a Prime or EidosEdea in the Graveyard. This will give you a decent starting point if things go rough in the next turn. You can obviously get a way better field than this its just the most barebone example.,Monarchs,d3cev95,1,t5_2wocf
7672323,0,t1_d3eahpg,I mean I did put out Infinity once or twice but generally I preferred the fact that Red Layer had more attack recycled itself and allowed Magnaliger which is too nothing to scoff at.,Monarchs,d3ear3d,1,t5_2wocf
