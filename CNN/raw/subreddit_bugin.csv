10856698,0,t3_5v5qxz,As said earlier I live in Brussels Belgium which is a country with a very high density of population so its quite difficult to find a place where you would be far away from big cities...Ive quite a lot of food water and some survivaloriented tools stored so Im all fine for the basic scenarios where I get stuck in my house power outage for a few days bad weather.... But in the scenario of a very big issue war or the likes my best scenario would be to if possible load everything in my car  van  ... and make a small convoy towards a close family house which is located in the countryside.The good thing is that we are quite close to the highways so even if the warning is a bit late well have more chances than the other to be able to hit the road. That is naturally if a lot of people actually try to escape I dont think its quite in the mentality of the people here. If Im not able to leave then I suppose the best I could do is secure the place as much as possible and wait for the first daysweeks to pass and see if I can make my move later on only a few tens of kilometers so walking could be an option if really needed.,bugin,ddzsii6,5,t5_300pd
