8263563,0,t3_453y7z,EUAny Alliance Traders EU inc Trading Guild Spots AvailableI was a member of another trading guild but so many of the members are now inactive nothing seems to sell anymore. As a result I want to create a new massive active guild store. The plan is to provide a store where people can selling their finds with a high probability of purchase. This also means that people keen to access a large market place for wares of all types would benefit greatly.Pros  There will be no requirement to make any gold contributions towards the guild and no event commitments  trading only. A dedicated store with a large variety of items from all levels.Cons  Patience will be required initially while members are joining Im gonna get the guild masters of my current guilds to post the info regarding this trading guild in the message of the day headings so hopefully we can build a big trading base quickly. If youre keen to get involved post your PSN ID or message me on PSN and Ill add you.My PSN ID  gdlkbuthumblCheers,ESOPS4,d5ai472,1,t5_36ayx
8507724,0,t3_4w56m5,i think its because the game was made for pc and is to hardware heavy for consoles lots of people who never played on a pc will tell u that the game runs good but its only cause they never played with fps i play on pc and on console and i once asked a console player wether or not fallout  has lags on console he said no... omg little do they knowbut i think what u describe is more or less a bug for example its usually enough to tap left analog stick once to toggle between walking and running but sometimes its bugged out and u have to hold down left analog stick.also if certain enemys attack u u get ur movespeed slowed because they do not simply punch u instead they use an ability that slows u its indicated by a cloud at ur feets.last but not least the game is sloppy programmed because when i ride on my mount and i attempt to cross a little mountain or any other difference in altitude my mounbt slows down and its super annoying omg such inconvenience!!!u r kinda lucky that u started the game so late because prior to dark brotherhood patch the game was very smooth no tripple loading screens no invisible enemys and i think no unusual long loading times but the so called performance improvements ruined the smooth gameplay and now we have lags in totally empty pve regions and not only in towns Dlucky because u dont know how good it was once and therefor u dont miss it... kinda like console only gamers who dont know how crappy console games r from a techincal perspective,ESOPS4,d650rli,1,t5_36ayx
