342822,0,t3_1y01ye,The part about crucifixion is actually slightly incorrect. The victim would most often die from suffocation as it is difficult to breathe while hung in that position. They would be forced to push off the nail driven through the feet or to pull themselves up by the arms to take a full breath. Eventually the pain and exhaustion would force the victim to hang still until dead.Source ,lists,cfgax2d,3,t5_2qhsg

7866774,0,t1_d3zlkc9,Argh dont be lazy. The text isnt that longgt The insecticides tetrachlorvinphos and parathion were classified as possibly carcinogenic to humans Group B. The evidence from human studies was scarce and considered inadequate. Tetrachlorvinphos induced hepatocellular tumours benign or malignant in mice renal tubule tumours benign or malignant in male micegt and spleen haemangioma in male rats. Tetrachlorvinphos is a reactive oxon with affinity for esterases. In experimental animals tetrachlorvinphos is systemically distributed metabolised and eliminated in urine. Although bacterial mutagenesis tests were negative tetrachlorvinphos induced genotoxicity in some assays chromosomal damage in rats and in vitro and increased cell proliferation hyperplasia in rodents. Tetrachlorvinphos is banned in the European Union. In the USA it continues to be used on animals including in pet flea collars.gt For parathion associations with cancers in several tissues were observed in occupational studies but the evidence in humans remains sparse. In mice parathion increased bronchioloalveolar adenoma andor carcinoma in males and lymphoma in females. In rats parathion induced adrenal cortical adenoma or carcinoma combinedgt malignant pancreatic tumours and thyroid follicular cell adenoma in males and mammary gland adenocarcinoma after subcutaneous injection in females.gt Parathion is rapidly absorbed and distributed. Parathion metabolism to the bioactive metabolite paraoxon is similar across species. Although bacterial mutagenesis tests were negative parathion induced DNA and chromosomal damage in human cells in vitro. Parathion markedly increased rat mammary gland terminal end bud density.gt Parathion use has been severely restricted since the s.gt The insecticides malathion and diazinon were classified as probably carcinogenic to humans Group A. Malathion is used in agriculture public health and residential insect control. It continues to be produced in substantial volumes throughout the world. There is limited evidence in humans for the carcinogenicity of malathion. Casecontrol analyses of occupational exposures reported positive associations with nonHodgkin lymphoma in the USA Canada and Sweden although no increased risk of nonHodgkin lymphoma was observed in the large Agricultural Health Study cohort AHS. Occupational use was associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer in a Canadian casecontrol study and in the AHS which reported a significant trend for aggressive cancers after adjustment for other pesticides.gt In mice malathion increased hepatocellular adenoma or carcinoma combined.gt In rats it increased thyroid carcinoma in males hepatocellular adenoma or carcinoma combined in females and mammary gland adenocarcinoma after subcutaneous injection in females.gt Malathion is rapidly absorbed and distributed. Metabolism to the bioactive metabolite malaoxon is similar across species. Malaoxon strongly inhibits esterases atropine reduced carcinogenesisrelated effects in one study.gt Malathion induced DNA and chromosomal damage in humans corroborated by studies in animals and in vitro. Bacterial mutagenesis tests were negative. Compelling evidence supported disruption of hormone pathways. Hormonal effects probably mediate rodent thyroid and mammary gland proliferation.gt Diazinon has been applied in agriculture and for control of home and garden insects. There was limited evidence for diazinon carcinogenicity in humans. Positive associations for nonHodgkin lymphoma with indications of exposureresponse trends were reported by two large multicentre casecontrol studies of occupational exposures.gt The AHS reported positive associations with specific subtypes which persisted after adjustment for other pesticides but no overall increased risk of nonHodgkin lymphoma.gt Support for an increased risk of leukaemia in the AHS was strengthened by a monotonic increase in risk with cumulative diazinon exposure after adjustment for other pesticides. Multiple updates from the AHS consistently showed an increased risk of lung cancer with an exposureresponse association that was not explained by confounding by other pesticides smoking or other established lung cancer risk factors.gt Nonetheless this finding was not replicated in other populations. In rodents diazinon increased hepatocellular carcinoma in mice and leukaemia or lymphoma combined in rats but only in males receiving the low dose in each study. Diazinon induced DNA or chromosomal damage in rodents and in human and mammalian cells in vitro. Some additional support for human relevance was provided by a positive study of a small number of volunteers exposed to a diazinon formulation.gt Glyphosate is a broadspectrum herbicide currently with the highest production volumes of all herbicides. It is used in more than  different products for agriculture forestry urban and home applications. Its use has increased sharply with the development of genetically modified glyphosateresistant crop varieties. Glyphosate has been detected in air during spraying in water and in food. There was limited evidence in humans for the carcinogenicity of glyphosate. Casecontrol studies of occupational exposure in the USA Canada and Sweden reported increased risks for nonHodgkin lymphoma that persisted after adjustment for other pesticides. The AHS cohort did not show a significantly increased risk of nonHodgkin lymphoma. In male CD mice glyphosate induced a positive trend in the incidence of a rare tumour renal tubule carcinoma. A second study reported a positive trend for haemangiosarcoma in male mice.gt Glyphosate increased pancreatic isletcell adenoma in male rats in two studies. A glyphosate formulation promoted skin tumours in an initiationpromotion study in mice.gt Glyphosate has been detected in the blood and urine of agricultural workers indicating absorption. Soil microbes degrade glyphosate to aminomethylphosphoric acid AMPA. Blood AMPA detection after poisonings suggests intestinal microbial metabolism in humans. Glyphosate and glyphosate formulations induced DNA and chromosomal damage in mammals and in human and animal cells in vitro. One study reported increases in blood markers of chromosomal damage micronuclei in residents of several communities after spraying of glyphosate formulations.gt Bacterial mutagenesis tests were negative. Glyphosate glyphosate formulations and AMPA induced oxidative stress in rodents and in vitro. The Working Group classified glyphosate as probably carcinogenic to humans Group A.Reference list below and you can google most of the paper titles to get to the actual text. Reading through those references that are related to glyphosate I see that every paper explicitly states that their studies are severely limited by confounding variables. I personally find the evidence to be very very weak.But then I approach this from a more practical approach which forces me to ask the question If we dont use glyphosate what are we going to use instead? because you know were going to use something else. How harmful is that something else? What is its risk compared to the very suspect circumstantial evidence of glyphosate risk?In other words if we abandon using a pesticide that has only the flimsiest of evidence of its potential harm to some people involved in its use are we going to turn around and replace it with something that we know is harmful?But then Im the kind of person who will take the unknown risk of getting run over by a car while I walk to the grocery store over the known risk of starving to death if I dont go grocery shopping. But thats just me.,lists,d40aqpq,2,t5_2qhsg
