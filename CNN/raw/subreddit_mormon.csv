20456,0,t3_1ucrrc,Why do Mormons baptize for the dead?  Short answer so that people who were good people and deserve to go to heaven but who werent baptized with proper authority i.e. as Mormons in their mortal lives can still benefit from the ordinance of baptism.  The idea is that while theyre dead before Christ returns and everyone is resurrected they can still hear about the gospel and accept Christ as their Saviour in the spirit world.  In that case the proxy baptism in the temple is as effective for them as if theyd had it done while they were alive. If they choose not to accept the gospel in the afterlife well then whoever did the baptism was at worst wasting their time.  Longer answer available here. Now.  Current practice is that Mormons should only perform such proxy ordinances for direct ancestors.  So my wife and I have done work for my parents grandparents et al.  When the church was new people sometimes went a bit far afield.  Although one kosher time was when an early church president saw a vision of the signers of the Declaration of Independence and then did baptisms for them and other Founding Fathers.Nowadays there are people who are a wee tad zealous and they do stupid things like doing baptisms for celebrities for lack of a better word.  Diana Princess of Wales for example IIRC more than a dozen wellmeaning goofs have done her work.  Same for Anne Frank.  Along those lines lots of wellmeaning goofs have done baptisms for Jewish victims of the Holocaust.  Given the horrible history of anything to do with converting Jews to Christianity this was an appallingly insensitive thing to do.  The Church has had to repeatedly tell Church members do not do temple work for Jewish people unless you are their direct descendant so as to alleviate the concerns of the Jewish community sadly some people are still idiots.Now why Hitler?  I dont know if anyones done a temple baptism for Hitler but given some of the stupidity Ive seen to which Ive referred in the previous paragraph it wouldnt surprise me At All.  Presumably someone thought Gee maybe Hitler just didnt hear the true gospel of Jesus Christ right and perhaps he can be saved even just a little bit if he accepts the gospel in the afterlife and has a proxy baptism done here.  I figure hes going down down down no matter what anyhow but go figure eh?  It would just be another example of someone being too zealous and doing something stupid.,mormon,cegrfwe,6,t5_2qky2

296818,0,t1_cf9iasf,gt This isnt about measuring historical figures by modern standards... Brigham Young gets a pass for believing there were men on the sun. Not for teaching that the law of God is that those who engage in interracial relationships with the Negro are subject to death on the spot and that this law shall always be so.Heres my take Racial equality is a thoroughly modern ideal. Brigham Young was not unusual in thcentury USA for his views on race. Moreover the ideas he repeated about CainHam did not originate with him. I like this post that characterizes the Ham doctrine was like a viral spam attachment we opened that some Protestant converts sent to us. I also like the book Nurture Shock which cites studies suggesting that racial equality must be actively taught to each new generation. Children do not absorb racial equality if adults simply avoid talking about race.To say that racial equality is selfevident diminishes the contribution of great men like Martin Luther King and Nelson Mandela. These men dedicated their lives to teaching humanity something new. I am grateful for their teachings and regard them as prophets inspired by God to teach us valuable eternal truth. Should I fault Brigham Young for not teaching that truth earlier? Only if I fault Spencer Kimball for not receiving Gordon Hinckleys revelation to build small temples or George Washington for not having Joseph Smith first vision. I can celebrate each individual that holds a light for humanity guiding us to new truth without castigating generations who came before.,mormon,cfbj4qh,1,t5_2qky2

Is that a basis a solid foundation for establishing a moral code? I think not. Ive wondered how deep the rabbit hole goes and I havent found the bottom yet. In tldr fashion I dont think I can learn anything from them except by counterexample. Your mileage may vary on an individual basis but I have no trouble calling out the hypocrisy of the whole organization. The LDS church does not have the moral high ground. Some examples... | | |||Matthew  vs. | The  billion dollars for the mall and surrounding highend condos. No one knows what the exact costs have been they can only be guestimated.Extreme sexual repression vs. |Smiths adultery polygamy polyandry and marriage to young teenagers. Looking closer at Smiths history and it becomes apparent that he married a high percentage of the women he came into close contact with especially if he spent the night at their house. Smith and his new spiritual wife whoever that was at the moment ran the risk of discovery. Emma told a few of them to get out in the middle of the night....and in the middle of winter too. Mormon polygamy was introduced by Joseph Smith for his selfserving purposes. Brigham Young learned at the foot of the master and continued the practice. Youngs count of wives is similar and overlaps in some cases with Smith. Another wellknown contemporary Heber C. Kimball said that he would think no more of taking a new wife than buying a new cow. Kimball also gave Smith his  year old daughter to marry. If you believe in mormonism tack DampC  to your fridge.Californias Prop  legislation.

His death in  left Young in charge. As soon as the saints were out of jurisdiction of the United States government what had been a dark secret that top officials were polygamists became an open practice on the plains. The practice continued under Young and Taylor for nearly  years. When Woodruffs feet were held to the fire after the EdmundsTucker Act disincorporated the Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints and confiscated their property the LDS president issued a to who it may concern statement against polygamy. Mormons continued to practice polygamy in secret until a second manifesto was issued in . The mormons wanted their legislators seated in congress so after the Smoot hearings polygamy was relegated to the fringe elements sometime before . The last person to have plural wives and not be excommunicated was Spencer W. Kimballs fatherinlaw Edward C. Eyring. Polygamy is the very definition of a nontraditional marriage arrangement.The thirteenth article of faith that begins We believe in being honest...| vs. | Their continual practice of lying for the lord. For many it seems that the end justifies the means. The best example I can think of is the modern apologetic school that gives SmithYoungetc. prophetic standing despite their obvious failures and abuse of authority. This is also known as unrighteous dominion. Mormon logic declares if Joseph Smith did something then he must have been justified. Jensen and Turley spelled it out clearly in the Swedish rescue. Mattson and others werent convinced that borderline pedophilia should be excused by waving a magic wand the divine right of kings or some other get out of jail free card. the  declaration that attempted to say lets let bygones be bygones vs. | Their  year history of extreme racism.The twelfth article of faith which includes the statement that mormons believe in being subject to kings presidents and rulers...|vs.|Their nondiscipline of Cliven Bundy for being involved and supporting an armed stand off in Nevada.

At some point in time however the Lord may prompt a victim to recognize a degree of responsibility for abuse. Your priesthood leader will help assess your responsibility so that if needed it can be addressed. Otherwise the seeds of guilt will remain and sprout into bitter fruit.

I would like to speak with them and I will keep talking with you if your down for it.  One quick question though. In your response you said He Jesus is the Saviour Lord and God who makes our salvation possible. But before this you said you dont believe he is not of the same substance as the Heavenly Father.  I agree partly that he wasnt of the same substance only in the sense of him having a physical body but he also had the spirit of the Father. He was the Father manifest in the flesh.  Sometimes its hard to comprehend the spiritual realm but I see it like this. This physical existence with our bodies is just like a car. If I get in my car I animatenit in a sense that I control it.  In this allegory I am my spiritual self my real self. I operate this body car until I leave it physical death.

This is the way the church has treated any reference to women and priesthood for a long time.  Believing that the word priesthood always means priesthood is not prooftexting.  Especially given that in the Brigham Youngera women were ordained.  That they also believed in and practiced the second anointing is not a mutually exclusive thing.I think Im probably not going to convince you that this quote is valid and my guess that is that you werent going to take us seriously anyway so Ill stop trying.

In  he had himself declared king of the earth and a god over the spirit world. His inner circle believed him. To prove their loyalty they traded their wives and daughters for admission into his lofty clubhouse.The problem with these mythologies is that they are all likely to be man made constructs. If one doesnt accept John  as truth and instead believes that Jesus was a man like all of us and not a god then it resolves to a philosophical question.

Rent utilities and spending money was well less than month.As a funny sidenote the monthly minimum wage in this country was month. Missionaries received  month for food transport and other necessities. I had a lot of native companions that had been a member for just over a year. Often they would run out of money much sooner than I would even though we were together all the time.

3567827,0,t3_3172sa,Original mormonism especially via the text of the Book of Mormon inherited the vindictive god described in the old testament. In many ways that was a missed opportunity. They could decided to jettison the worst and keep the best of what is attributed to Jesus especially the sermon on the mount described in Matthew. Instead the Book of Mormon authors decided to build on the old narrative with the jealous petty and infantile god of old testament tradition. Original mormonism also began assuming a trinitarian form of god. That evolved into three distinct beings. By  Smith had adopted a complex polytheism where man could be elevated to the same level as the head god that rules over this planet. Speculation about the nature of god and the limitationscapabilities of gods that are made of fleshbone and blood? was often expounded from the pulpits in early mormonism. One of the things that caused quite a bit of discussion was the conception of Jesus. Who was Jesus father? In their theology a godly sperm is injected into a human female and conception with the human egg occurs in the normal way. Jesus is godhuman hybrid organism. That is a great mythology! Tracing its roots leads right to Leda and the Swan.Another thing that Smith instituted in the early s was elevating living humans into the highest echelons of that pantheon. He elevated his closest friends and inner circle into the anointed quorum to future godhood. Those were those in no further need of Christs atonement their judgment was complete and had their calling and election sure via the Second Anointing. Traditional evangelicals find this disturbing and blasphemous. Many chapel mormons find the current temple rituals to be disturbing enough on their own while not knowing that higher rituals are still performed that include elevation of their friends and neighbors to Jesus level.The main reason I no longer identify as a Christian or follower of Christ is because there are other books on the shelf. The ideas in the bible do not hold a monopoly on truth. All ideas have to stand on their own merits with none getting a blanket pass that everything is good without question. The best evidence for me that Jesus was not divine even considering the long time span of  years and  lack of specific good documentation is that humans love to deify their heroes. Unlike mormonism where there are piles and piles of good evidence to debunk Joseph Smiths  year old religion there is a lot less known for certain about Jesus. It is disputed if he was a real person and if real then how much of previous mythologies have been heaped as praise upon him because it made for the best story? There are four main variant versions of Christianity Matthew Mark Luke and John. They dont tell the same story. John  sets Jesus as deity plain and simple. If we look to our modern day deities that include the ghost of Elvis the king then how many people have claimed to see Elvis somehow resurrected alive and well? Last I heard hes given up rockabilly in favor of pumping gas in rural Nevada. Our heroes achieve icon status some fail and are crucified.

They honestly dont know what tempo to play it at... and even if they did they dont realize just how much power they have in shaping their attack.  Slower is easier.  Unaccented is easier.  And your typical chorister is less trained than the pianist and cant correct them.  The end result is a congregation trained to sing that way if they sing at all.Frankly I dont think we need paid musicians but we could have some sort of training program to raise the bar.

Did I say something confrontational or offensive? Im just sharing my personal feelings and trying to be open and honest. The important thing to me is that I believe that Jesus is my Savior and I love him for what he did for me. I believe that he expects me to use the brain that has been given me and so I tend towards believing in science while also maintaining a faith in the divinity of Jesus. That may not work for you but it works for me. gt Is it? Tell that to Denver Snuffer John Dehlin Kate Kelly whoever that other cute couple that just got exed is there is a whole slew of people whos only sin was being vocal about a difference in belief.I dont know much about the others but do you have a working definition of apostasy that excludes John Dehlins actions? I just googled it and the first definition is the abandonment or renunciation of a religious or political belief. John Dehlin seems to have abandoned and renounced his religious belief in Jesus in the prophetic call of Joseph Smith in the divinity of the Book of Mormon and in the priesthood authority of the LDS church. That seems like apostasy according to that definition. Perhaps you dont think people should be excommunicated for apostasy. Thats fine but at least be honest about your opinion.,mormon,csc9rta,1,t5_2qky2
4371389,0,t1_csic150,I see what youre saying call it authenticity or integrity but to me someone like Kristy saying I have to hide my true beliefs to join the military communicates their lack of understanding of the purpose of joining an organization.DampC  says . . .that which is governed by law is also preserved by law and perfected and sanctified by the same.  That which breaketh a law and abideth not by law but seeketh to become a law unto itself and willeth to abide in sin and altogether abideth in sin cannot be sanctified by law neither by mercy justice nor judgment. Therefore they must remain filthy still.The whole point of the church is that if youre going to be perfected by law you have to submit to the law.  You cant put in a blog post that you think DampC  is mysognistic and shouldnt be taught and then simultaneously say Yeah. I submit myself to the law of God as outlined by the church.  Her true belief is fundamentally opposed to the true beliefs of the church.  She is unwilling to submit herself to the law and thus unable to get the full benefits of particpating in the organization she for some reason wants to be a part of.EDIT I mean in her blog she says she is devastated she cant go to the temple anymore and has lost that connection to divinity.  But God has established a set of rules and laws that govern access to that divinity.  Strait is the gate and narrow is the way.

Yet when they teach Nephi says they teach with their learning verse  by way of scripted speeches read from teleprompters and not by the power of the Holy Ghost. Never are any of them heard delivering an unmistakable message from God as was common in the days of our founding prophet. Yet they claim to have the identical gifts he had. So hes publicly teaching that the Church is a horribly corrupt institution and that its leaders are operating without the power of God.

I have been a college degree and many years of career experience in a scientific field hard science that prizes logical rigor.gt Q How do you reconcile Mormon Doctrine of a literal Adam and Eve a Missouri Garden of Eden and No death before the Fall with the reality of Evolution.A I think that you will find my answer unsatisfying but  I dont care about reconciling any of it.  The basis of my belief is in Jesus Christ and the reality of His saving grace not on the historicity of the Bible or other scriptural accounts of the creation story.  I find astronomy and biology and anthropology completely fascinating and easily accept evidence that the earth is many billions of years old and that human biology is the product of evolution from primates and that human civilization predates biblical timelines also that modern humans go back hundreds of thousands of years.  It would be ridiculous to argue otherwise.  And I teach my kids not to be afraid of science either we routinely talk about evolution and biology etc.I do believe in God but I dont have any idea how He creates a world.  Apparently according to scientific discovery He does it over a very long time  perhaps longer than even you realize.  For example astrophysics tells us that metals heavier than iron can only be created by supernovas.  Yet the earth and other planets in the solar system are rich in heavy metals everything from cobalt to gold uranium etc.  That means that much of the earths crust must have been created in a supernova that predates our sun.  Apparently creating our planet took a long time  like probably at least double the life of our sun.  See?  Fascinating!  Also apparently according to evolutionary biologists creating us humans takes billions of years of evolution from simple replicatinggobs of protein and nucleicacids to prokaryotes to eukaryotes to slimes to simple plants to vascular plants to fungi to manycelled consumers to fish to insects to reptiles to dinosaurs to mammals to primates to ... us!  Neat!If you want to reconcile the gospel with ancient prehistory or even recent history Adam and Eve with no antecedents anyone? then you are going to be disappointed.  But  that isnt the point of the gospel thats the point of science.  The point of the gospel is to point us to Christ so that we may be perfected in Him.

One thing about the church that continually testifies to me about the validity of what we believe is that Ive been teaching much of it for a long time. Ive studied with preached at and taught at many different Christian denominations and Ive never been able to teach from their manuals without correcting what I felt were very obvious errors. Except here in the LDS church. Ive yet to come across something that is abjectly false in what Ive been asked to read or teach about. Like for example the importance of what is used for sacrament. You may not be familiar how contentious of a subject that can be from church to church. Ive heard all sorts of petty nonsense that folks were sure was a matter of salvation. Like it has to be wine or it doesnt have life in it it has to be red wine because it represents His blood it has to be a specific type of unleavened bread and any deviation from that will wind you up forever forsaken by God and will wind up in hell over it.

5995469,0,t1_cy5i4oo,The differences are too wide to state succinctly. As I said perfectionism is at the heart of the Latter Day Saint theology per Matthew  being taken as a commandment and not a simple ideal to aspire to. This results in depression being widespread in the Brighamite church because people inevitably fall short. By way of contrast CoC is built on an inclusive philosophy built on Christian principles including Romans  Galatians  and Ephesians . This is what Christianity should be in my opinion. It should be a way to include people rather than exclude people. Of course Ive already mentioned the second anointing which is the most exclusive club in all of mormonism. Perhaps that is the Brighamite equivalent of grace. Still it may not be all that comforting of thought for the highest echelon when they are resting on their death bed knowing that according to their philosophy a beating is in store for them at the minute they take their final breath.Next consider the idea of excommunication and extended into the realm of blood atonement. Both acts are extensions of the same thought process. The Brighamites hold to the idea that people can commit acts where they should be entirely cut off from the body of the church. Excommunication is a dramatic way of simply getting the persons attention. The leadership will tell those being excommunicated that it is an act of love. In times past the leadership held a literal knife to the throat of sinners...to shed their blood as a partial atonement for sin.gt Brigham Young  I know when you hear my brethren telling about cutting people off from the earth that you consider it is strong doctrine but it is to save them not to destroy them.Excommunication is just one step short of blood atonement.The Latter Day Saints who will excommunicate their nonbelievers hold to the idea at the heart of blood atonement. Perhaps not literally drawing the knife across someones throat but the figurative element is definitely part of their judgment.They will say they excommunicate people as a chance for them to get right with god before they meet him face to face on the judgment day. Every person in the Brighamite branch is taught they will have to pay for every sin they havent repented of see DampC  per previous for the definition of true repentance. Likewise the bishop may instruct those who have confessed to sins even for trivia masturbation  that they should not take the sacrament until further repentance has been offered. They are cut off in a smaller way in advance of being totally cut off they are publicly shamed in the process.On the other hand the Josephites are much more aligned with protestants including belief in a trinitarian god that is beyond human comprehension. The Brighamites believe in exaltation and that the god they worship was once a man. Jesus is a godhuman hybrid organism. The holy ghost is a third noncontained aspect but separate from the other two. The basic concept of deity is different. CoC was enough inline with protestant thought to be accepted into a national council of churches which all profess similar theologies.A major difference for me between CoC and simple evangelicals McKeever Kirk Cameron etc. is CoCs acceptance of all people. It resolves to the idea of inclusion vs. exclusion. The evangelicals per McKeever are not accepting of LGBT persons for example. They were not present at the interfaith meeting in June for example.,mormon,cy5jc1y,5,t5_2qky2
6006316,0,t1_cy6vv75,gt Same being not same person. God is not and have never been a person. I stand corrected.  Coming from a Mormon background I was bound to get something about this wrong.  Can you help me understand the difference between a Being and a person?gtIf you dont believe the Bible to be true do you still believe God exists?A nonearthly power but perhaps not the JudeoChristian God.  More like Q from Star Trek.  My story if you wish to understand why I believe in it is here gtThat and all the other examples you gave is God using evil as part of someones judgement. If you read the context you will see that they all had multiple oportunities to repent but they chose not to. You can see that in the next verse in  Tess  That they all might be damned who believed not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness.But again youre reading the text of the victor.  He the allpowerful allknowing higherthanhuman life form is BLAMING the fallible human for the mistake.  Its like swinging at the golf ball and blaming the club you were using when you handmade that club.  Its just a shamexcuse.He was deceiving his followers who were trying to obey him and when they get it wrong or the prophesy fails He blames the subordinate.  Thats evil management behavior.gtI believe people have way to little faith. I think God is shaking his head at out pityfull faith. Honestly And again blaming His own tools.  Either He knew we had too little faith and shouldnt have promised such things He says they could do it remember? like the manager who promises a huge bonus to his employees but then sets the goal so high no one in say  years ever reaches is thats not honesty either.  Or He should have mentioned directly actionable faithbased miracles focused on what we could accomplish.  By faith you will find your carkeys that kind of thing.gtSo having laws telling them how to do slavery does not mean it was part of Gods original plan. Citation needed.  Where is this Original Plan so that i can see it?  This is the first time we have laws DIRECTLY given to man that are claimed to be written down at the time of them being given.  Adam writes nothing.  Noah we have no Book of Noah.  Moses is finally taking down words as to laws and Boom Slavery is right there in the top things to be directly dictated.Do you have some scripture outside the bible that states this Original plan directly or are you inferring? gtChrist did not come to stop slavery stop all wars correct all justice. He only came to provide a way to God. That was his mission. SO an allpower force had the ability to end war stop slavery and didnt yet you still call it good?When a woman is being raped by a homicidal maniac and a bystander does nothing we dont call that good.  If a policeman who has the authority to stop it does nothing we call it Bad.  When the Government dictates rules that make her marry the rapist we call that Evil Totalitarian and Crimes against Humanity.To say that Christ came and did not help and that God is all powerful yet still refuses to help is still an evil God.So far youve given no evidence for a Good god.  He lies blames His subordinates promises unreachable bonuses Creates failures when He is powerful enough not to endorses slavery because... it wasnt in His original plan but I guess the puny mankind forced Him to?  He creates insects just to inflict pain on mankind and animals.  He stands by and allows evil when He could prevent it.Thats the description of an evil person.  Any movie that featured a character like that who was then declared to be the Ultimate Loving Father would be very disappointing for the audience.And yet you cite the Bible as evidence.  A book that we dont have the origins for most of the stories Gospels being written hundreds of years later The five books of Moses having no authorship etc. etc. that was assembled by committee both the Old Testament and the New Testament. So lets add one more fault to God.  He is a messy historian.  He doesnt care to have His words written down the moment He says them There is no Book of Jesus in the bible. He doesnt seem to understand the importance of primary sources or of verifiable statements.  He doesnt mind if people burn the majority of documents nor does He correct when people misinterpret something dramatically different over the years.  He really seems to be a poor scholar and that lack of scholarship has led to wars death and harm to humans.One final point and then Ill let you respond Im enjoying this too.  I hope that comes across.  He is a murderer. Yup.Noahs flood.  God created God excused.  Oh I had to flush all those people down the toilet because things werent going my way!  Go on tell me why a person who drowns babies is a good person.  Pick any human you like and explain their motives for babydrowning were justified. Then lets compare and see if that holds for God but if there is no point ever in the history of mankind that babydrowning was justified with no alternative solution then why give God the benefit of the doubt?,mormon,cy6yiye,1,t5_2qky2

The fall would have introduced death and necessitated the function of the atonement.From a faith perspective were left to find reasons that would still require an atonement while ignoring that death has been part of the natural order for billions of years.  Some do this by suspending the natural order for a limited time and geography allowing a transcendent garden to happen.  Others make the garden itself metaphorical and Adam and Eve were figurative representations.And then were left wondering what has happened to the  years of modern humans preceding the garden and the two million or so years of our close hominidae cousins that were no less clever had families loved and interbred with modern humans before their extinction.gt Does that make me a heathen for cherrypicking around a prophetic statement?

But in a few times in history buying and selling people gave the people a chance at freedom. So if I had the money my intention was to put the person in a better situation did my due diligence to make sure the law knew that yes in fact I am buying a person to release them from their captivity and it wasnt going to create a legal nightmare yes I could see where buying a person to save them is justified.

8803970,0,t1_d7621qy,That is a good question. So I took a look at the sources to see what I could dig up. First I read the text of the original letters in response to the Ward Teaching message. You can read the original letter to Pres. Smith and his complete letter in response in Dialog A Journal of Mormon Thought Vol.  No.  Spring . The Ward Teaching message was published in the Improvement Era June  issue. The letter from Raymond Cope to Pres. Smith was sent November  and Pres. Smith responded in December . So I took a look at the December  issue of the Improvement Era to see if they said anything about it. I looked at the Ward Teaching message. I dont see that the IE ever printed any sort of retraction that was specifically directed at this.However as I was looking at the December  Ward Teaching message I noticed the title of the article on the following page that had been continued from earlier in the issue. The title is Young Man...Do Your Own Thinking by Marvin O. Ashton of the Presiding Bishopric. It seems to me that having an article titled Young Man...Do Your Own Thinking by the Presiding Bishopric in the very issue of the IE after the November letter to Pres. Grant is probably not coincidence.The article  starts on page  and it starts out this way after a poem Young man the important thing after all is can you stand all alone or do you have to be propped up  or putting it a little stronger are you in good company when youre alone? Can you paddle your own canoe? Its a mightly fine thing for you to contemplate having someone with you always to show you the better way but life just cant be that way.

As far as your quoted scripture goes they might say thats only talking about earthly marriage as Mormons dont allow you to cancel sealings to your husband if he dies. If youre a widow you can get remarried but not sealed again. If youre a widower you can get married AND sealed again. That is why many still say that Mormons havent done away with polygamy entirely.

When this woman discovered the land it was under water who afterward settled her sons in it and thus from Ham sprang that race which preserved the curse in the land.Considering that the ban was only in place on Africans it follows that the church taught that Africans descend from Ham.  The church has not disavowed that argument nor have they disavowed the Book of Abraham.  The only official church declaration is that the racial restriction on the priesthood no longer applies.

Does there mean there definitely is a tea pot orbiting Betelgeuse because I have a feeling there is and you cant disprove it? No. We have no reason to believe theres a tea pot orbiting Betelgeuse and therefore I dont believe it.

The best way I can put it is to say that through Christ much of what was in the temple became revealed as to its true purpose. So things changed as much as they stayed the same. gtIf so are all of these temples in gross violation of his instructions?not at all unless you think not being circumcised is a gross violation of His instructions. These things both changed for the same reasons.gtIf not how do you know that the instructions changed?Ive read the bible its all in there.gtIsaiah  calls the Temple a singular house of prayer. Through this we can conclude that there is virtually no gtimplication of a plurality of temples.and thats a singular scripture reference. Youre forgetting that the Mosiac covenant was intended for those under the birthright of Abraham and all their ordinances pointed toward Christ. Under Christ the covenants are available to whosoever will. So under this covenant the purpose of the Temple is different and its use is as well. Its no longer limited by the lesser priesthood. gtWhat is the justification for the erecting of LDS Temples today?   ...contain a striking lack of details amp gtinstructions particularly when compared to the Old Testament commands surrounding Temples...Many of the details are in the OT so theres no need to repeat them. Also just because the details about the temple arent included in DampC doesnt mean they werent given. When the details of the tabernacle were being worked out God said that Hed give the individual craftsmen the inspiration for each of the details of their work. I was looking for the scripture reference but I cant find it. Its in Exodus where they actually start the work on the tabernacle iirc. gtTo contrast the Jews have not erected another temple in Jerusalem since AD  when it was destroyed by the Romans.gtConsequentially they are literally unable to practice their religion by performing the required ordinances for it! Jews past and present would both acknowledge that building a temple anywhere other than Jerusalem is not condoned by God.Is there a question? Jews dont practice Christianity nor do they understand Jesus as the Messiah. gtIn light of this nearlyexhaustive comparison the LDS Church CANNOT truthfully make the following claim Since the time of Solomon temples have the same purposesnearly exhaustive is not accurate youre barely scratched the surface of the tabernacle temple of Solomon and modern day temples.Same purpose yes no doubt. If you dont see that youre not looking in the right place lol. Purpose is the same some of the practices have changed through the revelations of Christ and some of what was originally practiced in the Temple of SolomonTabernacle of Moses was lost to time and exile. gtSo then where did the entire concept of modern LDS temples amp the ordinances performed in them really come from?thats a matter of faith. Its accurate to say Joseph Smith but its also accurate to say God through Joseph Smith.gtMoreover if any changes are made or have been made to any of the temple ordinances at any time  what is the justification for it?calvarygtHas the LDS Church given an official answer on why these monumental differences exist between LDS amp Jewish temples todaymonumental is either punny or hyperbolic I cant decide which lol   But Ive answered this several times and all my answers as a whole address this..gtIf so what is it  and does it answer all of the questions on this post?Honestly dont know nor do I care....gtIf not shouldnt this concern you and every sincere Latter Day Saint?I dont serve the Church I serve Christ and its from Him that I find my answers through scriptures.

Which isnt agreed upon across all Christian sects. Our rationale for our understanding of the godhead can be cited with biblical scripture. Acts  statesgtBut Stephen full of the Holy Spirit looked intently into heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing at the right hand of God. gtLook he said I see heaven open and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.Also at Christs baptism all three members of the godhead are represented distinctly in person as a voice and as a dove. How can you be on the right hand of yourself? How can you beget yourself? The concept of the Trinity is a mystical interpretation of some scriptures and the word trinity never appears in the bible.

10370250,0,t1_dciwaj7,This is not a fair picture of the typical expectation of an active Mormon. You will also be expected to take every calling that is given to you without your input. They will ask you to accept the calling but saying no is frowned upon. Even simple callings can add hours of extra work to your week when done correctly. And with time more work seems to be added to each calling. I was Sunday School President seven years ago and it took about two hours a month outside of church. I was Sunday Scool President again last year and had over eight hours of meetings each month because of all of the committees and junk that had been added in my stake. The worst part for me was that  of they time felt like a waste that didnt contribute to the community. In any case OP to be a fully active Mormon can take many hours per week. How much time will vary based on your callings. If you do join learn that it is OK to say no without explaintion if the calling is too much for you to handle.

10422314,0,t1_dcp4s17,gt I dont think any member of the church has acted perfectly in every situation to move Mormonism closer to Gods ideals.Youre exploiting the bystander effect to remove specific blame from those most at fault. I understand that youre trying to use this to diffuse the emotion of the subject but in doing so you create an environment with no viable solution and no one left to actually take responsibility. The result is always. . . nothing.To overcome the bystander effect you have to point to specific individuals and make specific requests of those individuals. Church members have been denied this privilege. They have been trained not to do it just like you are demonstrating here. Those that point to leadership and criticize are disciplined. Even Bill Reel himself has to be very careful how he phrases what he does. Many believe he has won at leadership roulette and in another circumstance would already be gone.

Maybe we jumped on the political bandwagon.This type of slight happens in every group of human beings that has ever existed. There is nothing uniquely Mormon about any of this. It is nowhere near the cause of the major problems abuses and dishonesty of the LDS church that are being discussed here. But somehow I think you understand the difference between being human and institutional abuse dishonesty and denial.gtTheres a spectrum of abuse  big and small  that I think we all contributed to at some level.Really? Do you actually believe this? Can you really not see how this trivializes the big abuses by diffusing them across the rankandfile members? Was I part of those big abuses? I certainly wasnt a perfect member. Was my dad? How about my sister? How about the temple president that contorted her hand into the proper shapes as she cried because he believed so strongly that she would be better off for suffering that particular abuse? Who was more at fault there the temple president or my mother that stood by and just let it happen because she had been taught the same thing? Statements like this mock pain and allow abuse to continue.gtI can certainly agree that some leaders probably had a greater negative impact than your average member.Probably? Like youre not sure this is the case? Can you point out even one average member that has had anywhere near the negative impact as those leaders?Would you mind pointing out which leaders you believe have had the greatest negative impact for me please? What were the specific mistakes that they made? What are the specific mistakes that any of the current leadership is making that qualifies as greater negative impact in your opinion? Once youve done that would you please make that information publicly available and attach your personal identity to it? If not why not?gtBut this is just as much our church as it is theirs and I think we can learn from our past mistakes wrong behaviors of both members and leaders and start trying to slowly make positive changes.To believe that chapel members have the same amount of influence or ownership of the direction of the church is nothing more than dishonest. There is no other word for it. The leadership has made it abundantly clear that they offer no apologies. They never have and they never will.

The textual cultural and philosophical anachronisms in the Book of Mormon are actually much more significant than wheat or steel but everyone seems to focus on the latter.The Book of Mormon talks about the virgin birth a story that doesnt enter into the Christian community until  years after the death of Christ. It talks about atonement theology centuries before it was innovated by Christians in the years following Jesus death. Bottom line the Book of Mormon really cannot be anything other than a th century text. Its absolutely steeped in th century American Protestantism and Scottish common sense realism including some pretty direct refutations of Universalism. That does not mean of course that it isnt scripture. Scripture and history are two different genres entirely. ,mormon,ddp35c4,3,t5_2qky2

Your assertions and positions amount to nothing more than the Dragon in my garage position.  Also considered here in text formThe mere fact that there is a possibility or that something is impossible to disprove doesnt warrant any serious consideration of it.  Especially when there is an abundance of data that supports the opposite conclusion or possible conclusions that require less leaps of faith.  So once again to your original question  could Joseph Smith have experienced something ineffable in his first vision?  Sure just like I could have an invisible dragon in my garage that Im not aware of.  But all available evidence points to the conclusion that he was influenced by his milieu to have an experience similar to his first vision and that over time his recounting of the event grew to fit his expanding theology.  Believing that Joseph Smith was visited by aliens is just as preposterous to a fact based belief system as the idea that God came and spoke with him.  Neither are consistent with known data and neither have any pragmatic value that can be supported by data.   ,mormon,deei9ca,3,t5_2qky2

This data to me is only positive in terms of being publicly available.  My guess is anyone who wants to better help and care for those in faith crisis will see any and all available data as a positive step to us collectively figuring this out.,mormon,delu6mt,2,t5_2qky2

11570194,0,t3_6537ub,Your title and OP paints with a broad brush. I dont think you really have a good grasp on mormonism and especially not why people leave and may become exmormons. I would say there are two reasons why people are leaving mormonism Its implementation is hard edged. Their recent declaration of war against LGBT persons prompted thousands to officially resign. Its narrative runs counter to science. It is a religion started by a nineteenth century grifter. It makes testable claims which have not been born out of the evidence. It makes claims that only those deeply indoctrinated from birth would give serious consideration. Its just not true.Either of the above can give the first push towards the door. If it is only the implementation then mormons may retain thoughts from their childhood indoctrination that it might be true...if they fix some things then I might come back. These are the jack mormons. I was one of them but finally did my own research. I stopped relying on the testimony of my much smarter relatives. The fraud became obvious. If that is blatant antimormonism then so be it. However the exmormon sidebar includes thisgt gt Thomas Paine It is the duty of every man as far as his ability extends to detect and expose delusion and error.Moving on...you say...gt That the religion is not real Christianity Ive recently come to the conclusion that mormonism is a new Abrahamic religion with much more in common with the old testament than the new testament. Jesus role is minor in that his atonement relieves the burden of original sin. All other sins must be repented of and forsaken. If theyre repeated then repentance wasnt sincerely given and the previous sins come back per DampC . Perfection is expected of the saints. Matthew  is more than a simple admonishment its a commandment. The mormon atonement covers only original sin and those sins for which people truly repented of. That is a much smaller set of sins than the total faults of humanity thus Ive been starting to realize that it resembles Calvinism in that regard. In mormonism there are conditions on the believer beyond simply accepting Jesus as ones lord and savior. Smiths polytheism goes beyond any intercessionary saints. In the final incarnation of his theology in  he demanded to join the club of the gods himself per DampC . This made the realm of the gods very reachable and comes with the idea of an infinite regression of gods once being men. Smiths secret rituals borrowed freely from freemasonry. Secret passwords and the same secret handshakes are necessary to enter the lodgeclubhouse of the gods.  years later this looks to outsiders as the grifter continuing to ply his trade and providing carnival knock offs for the rubes that would buy into his deception. His secret rituals look like a coverup for his lechery polygamy and polyandry. Nauvoo period mormonism looks like a variant of other freelove movements of the nineteenth century except Smith lured women with promises of eternal club membership. In the rear view mirror Smith himself looks like other cult leaders especially Koresh Bent Jeffs and Jones.
