6122178,0,t1_cykfdyf,Mack is certainly very powerful right now but he isnt . He is probably in the high s getting close to . He has killed quite a few midrange cultist but none have been super high level themselves probably mid s to s. After a while it get harder and harder to level. He needs to move onto farming higher level mobs to keep leveling at the high rate he was before. As far as his point break down I could only give a guestimation but it would probably be  adaptabilty  vitality  intellect  strength. Mack really focuses on to being seen as his weapon. He sticks to the shadows for protection and attacks from them as well.  Therefore most of his points would go to adaptabilty. He needs to be able to heal when attacked so the next big lump would go to vitality. He has decent perception so it would win out over strength with strength getting the least.,jakethesnakebakecake,cylj0l5,3,t5_3agg0
