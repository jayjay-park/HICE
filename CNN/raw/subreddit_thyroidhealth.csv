8065826,0,t1_d4kv45q,Sorry for this late reply.  One thing to know about Adderall and levothyroxine LT is that LT potentiates the effects of the Adderall. So as your free thyroxine T levels increase your required Adderall dosage levels decrease.  If you say what the brand of the vitamin is I can probably find the ingredients. Its often listed in the inactive ingredients as Potassium Iodide or as Kelp.  The cortisol testing was probably at night for those levels. Cortisol has a diurnal variation much like TSH. Its highest in the morning and drops down during the day before it ramps up again as you sleep.  While stimulants increase ACTH and cortisol production in healthy individuals it may affect men and women differently men appear to more often see an increase and it also depends upon already existing dopamine levels and possibly norepinephrine levels some of this isnt clear yet. If youre dealing with a natural deficit of dopamine the Adderall may not be increasing cortisol production but may be decreasing it. And its possible that your ACTH levels arent increasing but your cortisol production is due to dopamine receptors in the adrenals. And those relationships can change with the the added levothyroxine. There are a lot of relationships between the different hormones and neurotransmitters that we dont understand.  Thinking about the isolated FT level again while a hyperfunctioning thyroid nodule could be responsible for that it shouldnt cause issues elsewhere to the same degree. It might cause increased heart rate and arrhythmias but a nodule releasing T wouldnt cause increased cortisol levels. If you feel your neck where your thyroid is instructions here and here and you can feel any bumps that might indicate the presence of a nodule. If you dont feel any bumps that probably means you dont have any sizable nodules.  You havent mentioned any of the common symptoms of T toxicosis such as heart rhythm disturbances rapid heartbeat or chest pain or the common mental symptoms of anxiety tension fear without reason and insomnia. The more I think about it the more Im  inclined to think it was a testing issue like the sample being left out for too long or something. But if you continue to have an isolated elevated FT level something may be going on.  ,thyroidhealth,d4mobe5,1,t5_3568x
9732947,0,t3_5eezq7,I had a complex nodule on my right side too.  cm. It was a hot nodule so autonomously making its own hormone. The scan was interesting. I actually could see on the techs monitor that my nodule was indeed producing hormone. For whatever reason we decided surgery was the best option. I just had a partial thyroidectomy on Thursday actually. The surgery was really easy. I took a week off of work but I probably only needed to take  days. Very little pain afterward. Its kind of a pulling sensation around your neck muscles. I got to be released the same day since they didnt feel the need to monitor my calcium levels. Honestly though your nodule is a little more concerning. Vascular components sometimes mean cancer. I dont want to freak you out but being honest there will be a chance. Also the fact that your nodule is cold makes the risk of cancer shoot up too. Fortunately the treatment for cancer is more the same. They would likely take out your entire thyroid and then maybe give you radioiodine treatment afterward. Thyroid cancer is one of the best cancers to have. Very little threat of metastasizing. Very slow growing. Tends to stay encapsulated in the thyroid. High remission success. Through the roof survival rates. You will probably be expecting a biopsy soon. If it isnt cancer Im sure they will just wait and see if it changes at all by giving you regular ultrasounds. Best of luck!,thyroidhealth,dacsqni,2,t5_3568x
