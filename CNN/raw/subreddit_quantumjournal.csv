8818429,0,t1_d77ucli,I get your point more now thanks. I agree that the incentives in place are such that often it is more about competition than collaborating for  contributing to a greater good e.g. advancement of science. Nonetheless I disagree with this being necessarily against reproducibility or correctness code would be released at some point and in the case above provided immediately to referees or this being about modern physics publishing mathematicians and physicists have often been secretive in the centuries about their methods and tricks exactly to preserve an advantage. Again I am not sure that you are asking for minimum best practices. It seems to me that you are asking for more than that. Of course we can discuss whether Quantum should be that daring as we are doing.,quantumjournal,d77usgh,1,t5_3g2sa
8819148,0,t1_d779de6,Do you mean the criteria of accept all submissions that are technically correct and well presented at the top of the page? If so then an empty paper would meet these criteria but I dont think Quantum should publish it. This is obviously a bit facetious but there are plenty of papers out there which only have a little bit more content than this.,quantumjournal,d77xw73,1,t5_3g2sa
