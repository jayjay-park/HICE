1846620,0,t3_2fpyz4,PK Subban is a keeper no argument there. He puts up good numbers across the board in your categories. Elite top  dman in fantasy hockey.Second pick Id take Bobrovsky. You never want to be left without a good starting goalie and hell get  starts this year assuming he is healthy. Always puts up good numbers.Third as already said is between Toews and Hall. Hall will get more points than Toews but his  will be much lower than Toews.  However being on Yahoo take into consideration that hall is CLW eligible which can make him incredibly useful to have. He has a higher ceiling than Toews for point production as well. The only damaging thing he really has against him is his  hit. Id personally go against the grain and take Hall. As a center he was top  points as a left wing he was first. Toews was th for all centers.  Left wing is one of the hardest positions to lock down multiple good players whereas there are a ton of centers who can net you upper s in points who wont be keepers. Only  teams means youre starting your first round picks  down the line and you can generally find guys like Staal Couture Backes Bergeron etc.,fantasyhockey,ckbpoy9,2,t5_2s0tu

I personally rank hall higher partly due to the positional thing. center is a really deep position and its much easier to draft a quality one late than drafting a solid left winger. even if they score slightly more the difference between hall and the next best left winger is larger than the difference between kopitar and the next best center.  if that makes any senseand LA is already killing it this year.  Im not complaining because I have carter on my team and he is producing like crazy.  but if you guys can stay solid all year and end up with a division title and home ice advantage instead of qualifying with a lower seed then youre automatically the favorites in my eyes,fantasyhockey,clanp01,2,t5_2s0tu

Specifically with DKs format this rankings is very accurate. I understand that it seems like Dmen are ranked higher than most people would think but Dmen can be extremely underrated in fantasy and offer more wellrounded peripheral stats than most forwards.

3316029,0,t1_cp67j7e,Hello fantasy hockey Napoleon. Wow. I personally think you upgraded your roster a huge amount. Keiths having what I think will be one of his worst years an enormous buy low and I think you capitalized by selling on Ekblad. Hes having a phenomenal year but would anyone be surprised if he gets  points and goes  next year? Minor sell high for sure.On name value alone on the nd trade you probably lose but in actual value for your league its not so bad. Datsyuk is older and the Red Wings have a history of resting stars down the stretch. It might mean nothing or it might mean you miss a game of his in your leagues playoffs. Hes also an injury risk in my mind. Hamilton is a stud D no doubt but Fisher is having an unreal year... that could end up being a wash though I think  of us would prefer having Hamilton. You are an Ottawa fan so hooray Ryan?Keith is a nice piece for the peace of mind you can get in having both Elliott AND Allen is probably worth it. Allen could very well get scorching hot and start a string of games leaving you in the cold if you only had Elliott. Tatar is also a nice piece big part of the Wings future.

Sure its not uncommon for the last place teams to stay that way but in my experience most last place teams are last because they dont put in much effort. They play like its fantasy football just kind put people in their lineup and cross their fingers. Rarely do you see a manager who tries hard have a super crappy team. On the rare occasion that does occur its usually just for one year. Only shitty managers suck for years on end and IMO theres not much you can do about those types. That said I run a competitive keeper money league. We dont allow head to head play we dont hand out high draft picks for sucking we dont allow higher waiver priority for sucking etc. Basically we dont coddle our managers at all. If you pay your dues and are active youre allowed to play but if youre a perennial bottom feeder its considered your own fault.,fantasyhockey,cph6pdx,1,t5_2s0tu

6178895,0,t1_cyrwvdw,Varlamov is a good pick up in my opinion going forward into the future more than this year. They have Mackinnon who theyre going to sign long term this off season with duchene and Landeskog for at least the next  to  years then on the line theyre resigning Barrie this offseason which is going to give them an on the rise Holden with Barrie and  EJ long term and Beauch which is a solid defense and offense protecting your goalie if you have Varm for the years to come. I dont know if I like Byfulgien in a league that doesnt count hits but that dual eligibility is something. What is leaning you towards Byfulgien instead of Panarin? I feel like Pans a great keeper knowing hell always be on a line with either Toews or Kane. Then you have two amazing F in OVE and Pan alongside Karlsson. I would go Panarin Karlsson Ove and one of the three you named. I feel like in a points and shots league theyre all solid guys to have but you may get more shots from Pac and Parise than Byfuglien.      I have a keeper league myself of  people but its an auction draft and you can only keep guys for three years and each year you have to pay  dollar on top of whatever you paid for them the previous year. We have a  draft budget of which most people spend  to  on their first two picks. I traded away stamkos Ove and Stamkos away because i was taking over this team in a league where the previous owner was so inactive that his comeback was nearly impossible and he spent too much early in the draft to have a defense. Its a Roto league and not headhead roto so everyone against everyone everyday pretty much until the seasons up. In return for those three I got Seguin Malkin  and Niemi  BUT I already have Patrick Kane at  meaning next year my Ill have Seguin Malkin and Kane for a total of about . I feel pretty good about that  I have been thinking of trading away Malkin for Burns who was only  in the last draft meaning he would be  next year and leave me with a lot larger of a budget for my draft but I like Malkin a lot and think hes going to go off in the years to come when the chemistry builds in Pittsburgh. Your keepers cost are deducted from the  budget for the draft you have.

Probably not but I can see him finishing within  pts of his total this year which would still have him near the lead if healthy. Crosby is extremely hard not to keep but for my money Kane may well be similarly valuable. Now if you add hits that could change.Im not sure how outofplace you feel EkmanLarsson is in this group but he could be the second scoring defensemen behind Karlsson next year and at this point hes almost a lock for  goals every year.I think you should keep Holtby OEL and a tossup between Kane and Crosby. Three guys that go in the first two rounds next year if theyre available is pretty damn good.

Both Stone or Niskanen are solid owns because they are solid in the SOGHITBLK categories I would prefer Stone because he is playing better at the moment so if you are hurting in those categories feel free to grab another D. Rielly has some fantasy potential but sadly with how terrible the Leafs are on offense I cant see him reaching it this season next year hell be ownable all season for sure though and I think Trouba can be safely ignored for fantasy purposes.If you prefer to go with a forward I would lean towards Boedker over Rakell slightly because of the powerplay potential.,fantasyhockey,d0bdh7r,2,t5_2s0tu

6922242,0,t3_4ajsly,Depends on your league.  Given that you were holding twice as many goalies as reasonable its clear you had no intention to try to win a match this year.  This is tanking just not for draft order.  Any deliberate loss qualifies such as benching players one week for a subjectively better playoff seed the next.Its a matter of philosophy.  Personally Im against tanking.  The goal of a game should be to win always.  Situations will always arise where where its in your long term interests to hurt yourself short term but its not in the spirit of the game.  It needs to be prevented as it gives incentive to every team to do the same thing.  A game of who can tank better is boring.  But its up to the league and its members to determine rules to prevent it if they choose to.  Its very easy to see coming.,fantasyhockey,d10ykoj,5,t5_2s0tu

Barkov and Kuz are pretty similar based on onice production I just like Barkovs situation a lot more than Kuzs.

9078979,0,t1_d82qr07,Agreed. If you are in a pool with a bunch of people that live in Winnipeg then Laine will go first. If you all live in Toronto then Matthews will go first. I personally am a huge die hard Leafs fan. With that said I think Matthews becomes a PPG player in a few years. But I can also see him being the next Teows always matched up againt the other teams top players with more defensive zone starts which could limit his fantasy production.

Would you also take Vasilevskiy over any of those  considering I also have Bishop? Also considering picking up Wideman and not having  goalies unless I drop Drouin which I dont know if is a good idea on a line with Stamkos and PP. Wideman wasnt fantasy relevant last year with the concussion and suspension but  season ago he had a career year and was pretty decent so I think theres some upside but not sure if theres enough to grab him.

I am a tarensenko owner in a keeper league for the last three years and while he is still one of the best players in the league and easily one of the best goal scorers I have noticed that his supporting cast has taken a serious hit.

A. trading Stamkos would be giving up completely on the playoff push while we are talking about a backup goalie and B. they still had a chance to sign Stamkos and a very good one considering they did.  Las Vegas gets to pick  goalies and each team can only pick  to protect so its hard to believe there are going to be  unprotected goalies better than Bishop or Vasilevsky.  That being said maybe they think backup goalie is important for a playoff run and maybe they are comforted by the fact that none of their skaters can be taken if they take a goalie.  But Im sure they are going to have some offers coming in from teams who realize their situation and are looking for a goalie of the future.   ,fantasyhockey,da37vx7,1,t5_2s0tu

You have Jones and Murray who should start lots and win lots so you just want to compliment their ratios and stats with Vasis.

Schneider is due for a market correction and if not this season could definitely serve as a solid keeper for next.
