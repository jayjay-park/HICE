4725236,0,t1_ctq20gj,Its not that they didnt give an update they just didnt seem to say when it would ship. A couple of things I think you should consider. This isnt the internet of  years ago. People expect things to ship fast.. Your egg saver shipping has a long shipping time because its free.. ok but what if I want my stuff in a day or  and am willing to pay for it. Is it competitive to charge around  for next business day then another . for expediting processing?. Speaking of next business day. How can a major retailer pretty much shut down their warehouse on weekends? Sunday I could kind of understand but Saturdays too?. If you cant give fast shipping or even affordable shipping can you at least have an accurate estimate of when items will ship or be delivered? Really almost  in shipping and just a vague items will ship in  business hours is total unacceptable. I really want to be a new egg patron. You guys are the stuff of legend when it comes to PC components... but that reputations is from years ago. Theres a lot more competition now. As mentioned almost  hours after my new egg order and no idea when item was coming. Amazon was able to guarantee the next day... for .! with primeHoping you guys pull it together and move from your outdated shipping model. ,Newegg,ctq5mhq,1,t5_2s66h

6259370,0,t1_cz149vj,Yep its a COD that I have to sign for. Im just going to tell them to send it back once I get it unless they give me  of the purchase back. Pretty crazy to ask for but if they want to keep a value costumer thats spent around  grand with them not counting this purchase then they should really think about it. ,Newegg,cz14e0t,1,t5_2s66h
6702855,0,t3_46yeib,The silver plastic bag is most likely the antistatic bag or the antistatic cushion. You should return the drive in it. The UPC would be equivalent to the serial number on the Hard drive. Its usually listed on the heavy duty sticker that has the drive information with the drive size brand barcode etc... ,Newegg,d0cmszf,1,t5_2s66h
6729241,0,t1_d0dfo3h,I just bought something from Newegg recently. I got it today but the graphics card wasnt working properly. I issued the return and it gave me info about the RMA and where to return it. So I asked them about shipping and wondered why they only gave me the information on where to send it and an RMA. So I went to chat support and the lady sent me a UPS label. Just push for a label but dont be rude about it.,Newegg,d0fd1yc,1,t5_2s66h
