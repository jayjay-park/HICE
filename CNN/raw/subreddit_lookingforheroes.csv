5393686,0,t3_3owbo3,Hiya MrtakeiteasyIm west coast time and Im roughly playing at the same hours as your group as well. I mostly play to have fun of course to win as well so that lets me have fun playing a lot easier. Im pretty Flex and mostly play AA characters but I dont really mind playing support too much. Currently I mostly play either lili or kharazim as my support roster and tyrande on the side as my supportassassindpscool plays and I play pretty aggressively. I dont have utherrengarmorales but I dont really mind buying them if needed. ,lookingforheroes,cw13qlj,1,t5_38ue5
