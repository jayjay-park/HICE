598335,0,t3_20zxsi,Alternate titles Who let the dogs out? FFS let the dogs out! FFS will now be known as the Orgrimmar Kennel Club Jesus FUCK! Thank god thats over. Fuck everything about that fight. Die on fire you Hellscream bastard. Local Heroes rescue wolves EDIT Its Miller Time!Its been a long road but FFS has cleared SoO normal. Took about four months from start and discounting three weeks of no raid for the NovDec holidays. Spent a little over a month on Garry himself but had to bring up two raid members basically from scratch new tank and another HealzDPS OS. Advice for anyone else trying Garry soon k DPS per DPStank means the fight will go pretty smooth Phase  Offtanking is difficult because of vengeance BEFORE you face Garrosh make sure your Healing  DPS lineup will actually work Practice on Flex . Your mistakes will be less lethal but you can still see where the issues lie. Only two things will kill you once you get into the nd half of phase  Interrupts and AddsIts a linchpin encounter basically everything has to go right for an entire  minutesThank you Karma Horde!,FTH,cg8a8tp,6,t5_2rw0b

8183069,0,t1_d503s8i,my concern with G SSDs for your games and OS is thisWindows  is about G more like  but whateverLegion is about Gthat leaves you about  gig to play around with including any addons you use which is about enough space for one AAA game. For me thats not enough space. you COULD buy two of these and RAID them. Its easy to do. I went with the  because I think its a nice mix of convenience and space.,FTH,d50fmkw,2,t5_2rw0b
