7538584,0,t3_4ikeg2,Sorry Im not a lady but my girlfriend and I have been living in our van for a couple of years now.  I think the most important thing is to just get used to being a little less clean most of the time.I talked to my girlfriend and she recommends getting a dry shampoo to keep the oil down.  She doesnt have curly hair but says that getting it wet periodically is important to keeping the curls?? A cheap spray bottle would help with that.We have running water in our van but she uses a bowl when washing her face at night to help conserve it.Baby wipes are great items to help keep BO more or less under control between shower days.  She likes Burts Bees baby wipes because she has sensitive skin but really its just important that they have alcohol in them so it kills the odor bacteria.Check out the community centers where youll be.  They often offer a cheaper price if youre only taking a shower.  Sometimes theyll even give you a towel and provide shampoo and soap in a dispenser.We also live in Colorado and just scrub down in the river on a regular basis.  Just dont use soap if you do this. Even the biodegradable kind isnt really very good to put straight in the water.I think it will come down to how clean you really need to be and finding what works for you.,VanLife,d2z3md4,2,t5_2wii5
8827623,0,t1_d78xxt7,Im giving it serious thought for the springsummer of next year so Ive got plenty of time to prepare. Theres obviously enough space in even small cars to do this so I dont know why this isnt more of a thing. Im guessing there must be a practical reason and I dont want to rip the innards out of a car to find some insurmountable problem that makes me regret starting.  ,VanLife,d78yhhx,1,t5_2wii5
