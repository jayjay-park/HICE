2279752,0,t3_2ladhg,Well first an answer to your questions.No. The next NFS game will be a while before it releases because of the dip in quality lately theyve decided to take more time making the newer games. Well probably hear something about it at the next E. In my opinion....Kind of. Technically you can play through both campaigns three times and it be different every time. Because theres three options for each mission in the campaigns. So if you play through one way once the next time you can use one of the other set of missions.But unfortunately the game is still pretty buggy. The multiplayer is okay but not good only  people per server. The map is well designed but smaller than you think and ends up getting a bit repetitive.IMO you should check out the new game coming out next month called The Crew MASSIVE open world racing MMO. Heres a cinematic trailer for it. Ive personally played the beta for The Crew and it was AMAZING. No limits you can drive ANYWHERE. Watch some gameplay videos for it youll see what I mean.But yeah as someone with  hours on Rivals beating both cop and racer campaigns  and being a big fan of the NFS franchise I can honestly say I cant really recommend it. ,needforspeed,clthui4,1,t5_2s8z6
4036234,0,t1_crg8byg,Yeah it doesnt make any fucking sense. Could they source out the servers maybe like in counter strike or arma???,needforspeed,crgd0f9,2,t5_2s8z6
4071425,0,t1_crkd35v,Well thats weird. The first thing I thought was that maybe your graphics card was the problem as it is an M which is one of the lowest NVIDIA cards in the  series but that doesnt make any sense as I remember playing the game with an GT and a GT. Try to lower ALL the settings to minimum and see if it makes any difference if it does there you have it.Also check the NVIDIA Control Panel and see if anything is changed over there.If none of this things works try to reinstall the game as administrator and running the . patch for your language as administrator too,needforspeed,crkdbh5,1,t5_2s8z6

When I buy DLCs from Rockstar or Bethesda I get the feeling that Im now paying the devs to gain access to a new portion of the game which I am happy to do because the content is worth the money. for  cars? Fuck off... for  new weapons a new landscape a new storyline a trophy list and more armorskins? Sure!Its EA so just kill off your hopes and dreams for a clean and userfriendly game that you feel is built with passion insight and knowledge about what makes NFS as good as it can possibly be. There will be DLCs or microtransactions and they will only release this to make as much fucking money as possible with zero fucks to give about how we feel as soon as the game is out. Because they need to get to work on the next NFS.,needforspeed,csi5886,2,t5_2s8z6

One minute an opponent will be so far ahead that I feel like making no progress and the next minute Ill be passing them at mph while they are going speed limit in a corner. Also the handling is a bit iffy but I feel like playing around with the tuning settings could help fix that. On the positive side the level of customization is incredible. Its what Ive always wanted since the disappearance of the Underground series. I love that the game is actually in tune with current car culture.

5397193,0,t3_3oyao0,For those that played the beta the sentiment was largely the same. For being twice the size of Rivals it felt no where near which itself was x km and had over  Mi. of road.Now to double it and have around  I was left questioning much of the design of this map. so much if it feels empty.What roads that are there are more than satisfying to race on but you dont get a good sprawl that we were all expecthing from the screenshots.Theres times when the map feels fair sizable and satisfyingly so theres others when you realize each area feels quite restrained given that when you look at all the mpty space there was and still might be much more room to work with.Like the E build my hopes were this was just the Beta map that the sat images to the north west west and south east would also be areas left to explore and or expanded upon in contents updatesBut we wont get ANY info on that until a week before it comes out as we can see with the car list that was moved to October if Only just Its now the th and were still trying to pry info so welll see what comes of NFSs world upon release and the next year or two to come.

For a  triple AAA title I should be confident in expecting more. The beta basically gave us everything we were to expect and thats fucked. Ive discussed my issues with this game in great detail in other threads.Argue with me if you will but I think NFS has met its end tragically ironic considering the developers name. If only Black Box were brought back to work on what they made legendary things may have been different. Say what you will NFS The Run was a great game for what it was.Was going to make a video discussing my issues with this stuff but I dont think its worth it anymore.

5544231,0,t3_3r27pb,I watched the video I agree with him that the game looks nice. Ive watched about  hours of streams of this game since EA access and I can say that the game has major flaws. The AI is awful I watched a guy spent  hours and  odd attempts trying to do one race and his driving wasnt bad it was the fact that the AI has stupid so unrealistic rubber banding it was Amys race also the AI physics are so bad if you ram them they will not move when they nudge you the slightest u get rammed so hard it makes you crash its like there cars weight  tonnes and yours is a tin can. The cops AI are so dumb they dont even really try to bust you if you go fast you have to slow down to a snails pace for them to catch up and its to easy to evade them. drift train events so frustrating must have heard k swear words on twitch saying how incredibly lame they are.. doing a perfect drift all the way around the corner getting  score then just about to straighten your car up and exit the corner and u get nudged from the side and behind by the dumb AI loosing all your points adding to this the AIs score goes up when they dont even do a drift it seems  the time when you complete a drift that you actually get points for the AIs drift score goes up at the exact same time.. I mean wtf! I could go on an on for hours talking about the negative aspects of this game but I wont. What I will say is this right now the game feels like it is a beta and is a disappointment people will buy it but it will be collecting dust after they beat the story witch takes  hours. The multiplayer sucks  people to a whole map I mean seriously.. there should be  people! there are no leaderboards in the game also. Dont even get me started on the customization dear me.. what an epic hype train they lead us on there! I am praying that ghost has a plan of attack to address these issues asap because I do believe this game has alot of potential to be a great game!,needforspeed,cwkba05,1,t5_2s8z6

Its neat that when youre racing you come across other people but this could definitely be improved. The cops?! What cops. I mean their cars look great but thats all I could tell you. What happened to need for speed most wanted game play? I was so excited to be having those twenty minute chases where the whole time your on edge trying to wreck their cars and not get caught.

You couldnt just use your cars to earn money to upgrade whatever you wanted you were forced to do what it said you would do.Then theres the ridiculous animation things at the start of races and police chases that were just fucking weird and out of place.I hated Most Wanted .,needforspeed,cwn00j2,2,t5_2s8z6

5585558,0,t3_3rmxlt,I just use the master slider to tune it down a little over half way down the drift side. I think make steering wide and body roll stiff. I may have the name of the sliders wrong there I think make NOS towards the power side because I prefer to get a quick boost of energy versus a slower burn with less increase. I use that for everything and do decently. It probably isnt good for sprints but I do it anyway for now.

5708295,0,t1_cx4lzre,Yes you are correct. This page helps clear a lot of things up. One simple rule I follow when I create advanced tunes in Gran Turismo  is that the more downforce you create the better your cornering ability and stability at high speeds. However generally the less downforce you create means you have less air resistance at extreme straight line speeds so your top speed is higher as opposed to having a spoiler or something that adds downforce. So I have high downforce builds for my track cars and little to no downforce builds for my top speed and drag cars. Think of the Bugatti Veyron whose spoiler deploys at mph to help increase downforce and keep it planted on the road in straight lines and in corners. However to hit the Bugattis top speed of mph the car must first be stopped the driver turns a special key to activate the checklist for the top speed run and some of the things the car does is retract the rear spoiler close the front air diffusers and drops the suspension to just .in .cm ground clearance. All this leads to less downforce and a streamlined aerodynamic rocket.,needforspeed,cx4o49v,1,t5_2s8z6

However this is not the same as the rewards you get for completing a daily challenge. As I guess you meant those rewards all I can say is that the rewards from dailies just vary between the type of challenge. The amounts are predetermined and the same for everyone and they vary between k and .k for Cash and .k and k for Rep.It just happened to be that todays three dailies were the cheaper ones. Check out the Wiki for the rewards for every type of event it hasnt been updated with the postpatch challenges though By the way something that I believe that has been changed is the distribution of the monthly rank milestones.

First Imma put the first EMail I wrote to EA there...Greetings EAI just reached finished the new racing game of yours Well I got all achievements  trophies... and I wanted to spend some time customizing some decent cars when I thought this Hmm... something is missing. Think of this You could add so many things to the game to spice it up with nostalgia. Here are some nostalgic ideas first Widebodies from the Underground series!Boy I loved Underground... and especially Underground ! Before you think this is going to be about underglow and stuff no. Its not. But since quite a few cars have returned from the old games you should give them their widebodies back they once had. The Vapor and Mantis widebodies were true favorites of fellow tuners. Others even appreciated the Armageddon and Apocalypse widebodies on certain cars. You see where Im going? Bring back the Underground widebodies for cars that have been in the Underground series such as the S Skyline RX Supra etc. ... More cars!You saw it coming didnt you? There are so many cars you could revive. I know youre not wizards. But this should be possible. Here are some cars that might fit the scene  Mitsubishi Eclipse GSX Come on this one is a classic. Also a wellknown rival of the Supra. You dont have to ruin it with the FWD though... since the G also exists with AWD. And thats what would make this car a killer on the road.  Honda Integra DC Type RRemember the Vortex Integra you used to drive at the beginning of the Underground career? Yeah... that one... well come to the vinyl wraps later but first... Bring this car back! It fits the scene! But umm... whether its FWD or AWD... that doesnt matter. Please make it AWD!  Nissan ZDo I even have to explain why this monster has to be in this game? Do I really have to?  Ford Mustang GT Sure this car played less of a role in the Underground series as it became more known for being driven by an antagonist in Most Wanted. But you cant say that this car doesnt deserve to come back.  Mazda RXA cheap alternative for those who want to spend less on buying the car but dont fear to max out their credit cards on buying performance parts. Its not the best car but it can easily turn into a rocket with the right parts.  Mitsubishi  GTIt might have been more of an underdog but you should never underestimate a car like that. Especially not if you turn it into a greece lightning. This car in NFS and you might see lots of decent rides.  Mitsubishi Lancer Evo XA true street sweeper and a hell of a JDM beast. This one would please lots of hearts of the NFS community. Just add it to the game.  Audi RI havent seen a single Audi in this game. Not even the R! How dare you? It would make a great car for those who like it fast. Vinyl Wraps!Ok there are lots of wraps you could add. Maybe even some new stickers. How about those  Skyline Eddie Wrap Z Rachel Wrap DC Vortex Wrap Mustang GT Razor Wrap Eclipse Underground The one from that Underground intro... Wrap Evo X Showdown Ryo Watanabe Wrap  R Stacked Decks Darius from Carbon Wrap RX Mia Wrap BustOMeter!Ive got a little problem. I never know when exactly Im almost busted. Thats why I cant do those pesky daily challenges where I have to escape after ALMOST getting busted multiple times. And thats bad. You should change that. Speed Trap!Remember that mode where you had to drive through checkpoints as fast as possible? Yeah maybe you can turn this into a thing again... Mirroring!Do you know that feeling when you perfectly create one side of the car and place the vinyls with precision? And how do you do the other side? Well maybe this would help.Keep in mind I sent this mail BEFORE the Legends Update was announced. Now we kinda have a few things that have been mentioned here. But dont worry. Here comes EMail !VeilSide Bodykits!If there was the Z this would be pretty neat. But for the RX these bodykits would be a musthave! VeilSide is quite known in the tuning scene... even if it is... lets say... exotic... and maybe a bit riced. But hey its NFS. So I wouldnt blame you! New rims!Not all the rims are fitting perfectly to each car. What happened to BBS? Zigen? RacingHart? Enkei? Those were the good ones back in the days... you should definitely add some of these into the game. Improved Improntu Race Routes!When Im challenging someone to a race I really wouldnt like the race to have a terrible route. Especially the train rails... they can be a pain in the bottom. Maybe you guys should do something about it. Engine Swaps!What if you would take a Civics engine and replace it with a Cs engine? Or how about a Fairlady with a Z engine? Or possibly a Golf with a Skyline engine? The possibilites... you should try that out! Audi!!!I wont explain why. You know for yourself why this has to happen. Ferrari Customization!I dont know what is going on with Ferrari but you need to sort this out! A lot of people are requesting LB widebodies to be a thing. And guess what? When Deadmau turned a Ferrari into a Purrari they wanted it back. But when someone makes a Liberty Walk kit I havent seen anyone complaining... and besides THIS IS JUST A GAME. Even more cars!Yeah I got some more ideas... and these might be worth it aswell...  Honda CRX ED  Ford GT  Nissan ZX Z  Toyota Altezza  BMW M E  MercedesBenz C AMG  Dodge Charger  Well for now this is it once again. I hope I can receive some feedback from you in case you should read this. Id highly appreciate it.,needforspeed,cyin9lf,1,t5_2s8z6

6461310,0,t1_cznfgv2,I wondered about that too actually. Because on a majority of the AWD cars it says they have an intelligent AWD system not a  AWD system like Hoonicorn. Im almost tempted to try and play with that abomination given the handling tweaks theyve made and see if it drives any better now. The Huracans size definitely factors into things no doubt about that. However consider this given the Murcielagos larger profile since a lot of the later drift races have sharp  degree turns if you pull a brakehand brake turn that immediately swings the back end around you can easily score k points despite dropping to MPH.This is how I was pulling off such massive scores. Rather than wide long drifts for a few thousand that I have to cut short on those sharp corners I just take a really sharp double brake rear end swivel and the larger ass on that thing scores more points because of its angle. Bigger angle  more points.,needforspeed,cznn5d9,1,t5_2s8z6

Hot rods are what started car culture in the first place at least in America which is where the game is set albeit in a fictional city and the Hoonicorn was specifically built to break loose the way it does. Hell just about any car can do a burnout on wet surfaces with enough power. Addition this games main story has  parts one for each icon.

6835235,0,t3_495gcc,I think the game needs a customisation update. So more NFS bodykits will be so ideal for some cars. Maybe add autosculpt? Autosculpt was a huge add on for the series years ago and now its gone. I understand if you cant do it because it might take much resources to add in. But autosculpt was such a amazing thing because if you didnt like how the wheel looked you could customise it and make it how you like the wheel dimentions to be. I know autosculpt was in body parts too but I think its better to add it for wheels. Imo this game is based around customisation and you got so many people putting hours customising their cars. So why not add it in? Maybe also add more camber and lowering for cars? I might sound like a dck here but the pics that you have on the main menu on NFS  you got cars in the pics that have more stancing than the option you can stance in the actual game. I think a update for purely customisation will be awesome. I know people want more carsseeing people in youtube twitter etc but I think the customisation is becoming stale. So why not update the garage tools? P,needforspeed,d0r2qbu,7,t5_2s8z6

The pursuit tech you can use to wreck other drivers adds a fun element and you can damagewreck your car out of the game. Customization is somewhat weak though its basically buy faster cars and faster upgrades to cars. You can also force realplayer interaction.

7239716,0,t1_d20xhod,I think its awful for customisation wise imo. If you notice the NFS bodykit for the Viper only changes the splitter. Now apart from a different splitter everything is the same as manually changing the sideskirts arches spoiler. So essentially you can manually change the kit and have the same NFS bodykit without the splitter for a cheaper price lol. Basically if you do choose to buy the NFS bodykit for it youre basically buying thats how much the NFS bodykit cost for a splitter. Plus if you select the hood the hood doesnt change. Instead it gives the car left side arches.

9038004,0,t3_540m0p,Thank you for mentioning Carbons wobbly streets.  I always say that Carbon is largely a worse version of Most Wanted and part of that is that ironically I think the newly added muscle cars would have been a little more usable in Rockport than Palmont.  I liked driving the muscle cars they were a type of car that we hadnt really seen much in Need for Speed up to that point and they demanded a different driving style than the other cars but I felt like Palmont had a lot of narrow roads and sharp corners that didnt leave room for going sideways in the muscle cars.It seemed like the tunermuscleexotic rock paper scissors thing didnt really work in Carbon.  Muscle cars were required you to drive them differently but I found them to generally be an inferior option to tuners and exotics because of the world design and tuners and exotics felt mostly the same to me just exotics had better top speed and acceleration than tuners.  It wasnt really  different but equally viable play styles muscle cars were fun and different but werent the best choice if you were trying to win and exotics were just an objectively better version of tuners.I also felt that Carbon was maybe too dark.  Underground  also took place completely at night but it felt like it had more visual pizzazz and variety more lights and colors cutting through the darkness.  Undercover was bad in the opposite way from Carbon a little too open at times and then long highways seemed to make up a significant portion of the world.Also agree that Burnout Paradises open world is excellent.  The game put exploration at the forefront and rewarded you for doing so by letting you find new events and jumps and billboards.  I remember it being a somewhat controversial decision that Criterion didnt have an option to restart your last event but that also made you drive around the world where other games provide you with an open world and allow you to just fast travel everywhere and exploration becomes a waste of time.,needforspeed,d7y83er,1,t5_2s8z6

9431606,0,t3_59tvmp,Most Wanted from  still stands out as one of my favorite Need for Speed games and I know a lot of people hold Underground  to a high regard too. NFS  is almost but not quite in every regard. Theres modification but its not quite at the level of previous games. There are those boss battle type races but theyre not as engaging as theyve been in previous games. I still rock out to the soundtracks of previous games but I couldnt tell you a single track off of the new games playlist. The graphics are gorgeous but nighttimeonly racing shrouds a lot of that beauty. Police chases used to be fun and legitimately challenging but in this game they feel like an afterthought. I miss the pursuit breakers heat levels and the progressively aggressive police response. I dont mind the story of the new game at all. It was corny as hell but thats been the case for many other NFS games and its endearing. Theyve got a lot of great elements from previous games that they could pull in and integrate  my best hope is that NFS  was just the first step in making a game for newgen consoles. ,needforspeed,d9birh0,2,t5_2s8z6

10503473,0,t1_dcynr0e,Theres an indie arcade racing game called Racing Apex that Ive been getting pretty excited for.  Their twitter page was dormant for awhile but theyve recently started tweeting again in the last few days.  Its got a lowpoly art style reminiscent of Virtua Racing from the early s and an option to put guns on your cars for more combat oriented racing.  Theyre taking suggestions for cars to include in the game.  Apparently they worked on Midnight Club and Burnout Dominator and Paradise in the past.

10646891,0,t3_5scgqj,Well it moved with the times. They went with what was popular but theyve been on a decline in terms of sales since . Theyve only sold .M copies of the latest but it was only on  platforms. I think they should go for the Underground style again because at this point I think it will only lead to positive results. But then again the issues arent necessarily the game setting its the mechanics of it. Theyve been on a more drifty arcade slope for the past  years that they need to stop and fully transition rather than try to have feet in both pools at the same time. They need to focus on one subgenre because trying to please both only leads to no one being satisfied. Who knows if they could get their stride back I could see them alternate HP style and UG style every other year. Id just stay away from simulators. It was risky and not completely shifted with Pro Street and that led to mixed reception. Shift was cool but it didnt need a successor Shift  was just an updated game not necessarily a new one. It would be a bit weird going to Shift  after Shift  but not so weird to flip flop the UGMWCarbon titles and thats important in my opinion  but Im getting a little off topic here. ,needforspeed,dde589f,8,t5_2s8z6

11159562,0,t1_dewx0yk,product placement and sponsorship ok. But seriously maybe it is  year old but thats not even enough to make the sponsorship worth it.

11689694,0,t3_66s52g,gt I found some videos on YT Holy Jesus Christ that looks terrible. Looks way worse then vanilla Most Wanted .gt I tried to use the one in this post but the link is broken and the post is archived so I cant commentreply anymore.So use mods from newer threads.Anyways if you want you game to look like thisthen just follow the instructions below.Pretty much the essential mod list for Most Wanted  ExOpts  Widescreen Fix  ENB  V  Aksines Texmod V. Retexture  Deadzone adder  Hex editied to remove rubber banding  Modded save game that adds hidden cars to gameAlthough you cant really install them alongside eachother as is you need to change a few things. If you are installing all of them first install Widescreen Fix and then ExOpts make sure to use the dinput.dll from the first  Widescreen Fix. Then when installing the  deadzone adder rename the .dll to dinput.asi yes change the file type and then put in the scripts folder. The rest should install fine Download links  Reddit auto hides comments with Mega links so had to use Pastebin,needforspeed,dgl1mcr,1,t5_2s8z6
