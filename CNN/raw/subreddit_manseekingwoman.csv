3393281,0,t3_2yr33g,Wow. What an incredible episode. In a society plagued by malecentered comedy and perspective this episode did an incredible and hilarious job of shedding light on the daily struggles of single women. Im a man but I totally related with every scene in this episode. My hat is off to Mr. Rich and the writers. Such a great and refreshing episode.,manseekingwoman,cpf2757,7,t5_35uxh

10690954,0,t3_5sxig6,I absolutely love that this season has not held the Lucy development and storylines back to focus on Josh being the lead. One could easily argue Lucy is the lead in the show now. It is really nice to see the other side of the relationship and letting Lucy run wild with episodes. ,manseekingwoman,ddioyjm,30,t5_35uxh

11092036,0,t1_dep0mxw,Its really the perfect balance. It gave us closure to Joshs arc. He found the perfect girl and we as an audience spent the whole season learning to love Lucy too. So it was earned.If it doesnt continue we at least know that they fought the monster together and had their own happiness in the storm. I desperately want more episodes but I loved this episode. If it were the end Id be satisfied.,manseekingwoman,dep9te2,4,t5_35uxh
