5872658,0,t1_cxpf6rq,Thats funny my wife ordered the Stylo because her Nexus  doesnt hold a charge for more than  hrs before its in the red. She loved it though except for the memory and the battery life now. Also it just randomly shuts off. How do you compare the  so far?,CricketWireless,cxpfqzz,1,t5_31v5m

9083639,0,t1_d83pbxp,This is basically saying that if your using tethering in a plan that does not have the add on or using it without paying for it you are violating this part of the terms and conditions of service,CricketWireless,d83petl,1,t5_31v5m

9281517,0,t1_d8s9owf,iPhone uses SIM card for service like other phones  youll need a nano SIM card.If you have existing service then just put your active Cricket nano SIM into the phone when you get it and itll work right away  if youre using a micro SIM card then you can cut it down to nano size or just buy a new nano SIM have Cricket CS replace the SIM card on existing line.If youre signing up for new service then buy the simfree iPhone from Apple and a Cricket SIM kit from AmazonWalmartBBTarget  during service activation put in the phones IMEI and SIM cards ICCID to activate service.,CricketWireless,d8shzhu,1,t5_31v5m

9630699,0,t1_d9zfocx,MMS works on every phone and platform in the world. Its a bit annoying using a service for each person because they prefer something else. For example I still have some friends with basic phones.,CricketWireless,da06jod,1,t5_31v5m

10374498,0,t1_dcfy3x9,Confirmed it does work. I would recommend going through the unlock process though as when you eventually decide to sell it will increase the value some.,CricketWireless,dck0fys,1,t5_31v5m

10686124,0,t3_5st0ks,Thats right. I was under the impression that Cricket was GSM but TIL that they are pulling the plug on GSM.

11053279,0,t3_5xhw46,I thought that if you have a noncarrier phone then the updates are still pushed through.  For my Oneplus One the updates were pushed through by Cyanogen even though I was on Cricket.  Similarly Nexus updates would come through from Google irrespective of your network.Cricket has never sold LG G.  So if it is an ATampT G phone then I thought that ATampT would push the updates through even if you were on Cricket.  Why would someone need to borrow an ATampT sim?Or did I get this all wrong?,CricketWireless,dekvcal,2,t5_31v5m
11128370,1,t1_detdvwf,Just let it go bro. There are standalone smart watches out there. This will just turn into unnecessary argument over defining reputable which I dont have the time or patience for. ,CricketWireless,dete3bq,-1,t5_31v5m
11180666,0,t1_dexoggv,After talking to support today I was told that rather than just reboot the phone I should shut it down and wait five minutes before turning it back on this is after they did the tower reset.  This seems to have helped  Im still not receiving Amazon codes but Ive started receiving them from a couple of other servers that were giving me trouble.I contacted Amazon and after providing some documentation they disabled FA on my account.  Ive since turned it back on with an authenticator app and call me rather than SMS as the fallback.,CricketWireless,dezbduz,1,t5_31v5m
