Indeed most people on magictcg are the ones who roast modern for being too linear and fastI think that the negativity is just some kind of MTG chinese whispers.

All of the  mana cantrips are modern legal not m forward. Thought scour was printed before m and is not legal.   there is no banlist from the japanese companies.

9198906,0,t3_564fzg,I think its really feasible.  I tried building a Cheerioslike Frontier deck  and it look it might actually be playable albeit not at a Tier level. I also suggest running Displacement Wave which can bounce back your drops for just UU.   Also splashing red could allow cards like Molten Nursery for some creature removal or as an alternate win condition.  I also suggest lots of drawcards since the deck is a little slow to assemble on its own.  Some people I know suggested splashing White to mainboard a x of Sigardas Aid. Thats mainly because you can supposedly respond to your own drops with another drop causing the lifegaining trigger to resolve at maximum output for each drop. I dont really know if this hurts the decks consistency though...,mtgfrontier,d8i1232,1,t5_3gjom

Id also suggest cutting the red gearhulks and the sword of the animist for something much lower to the ground like monastery swiftspear  the UR  prowess flyer.

10462990,0,t1_dcsuoms,I dont agree on necessary price increases for other cards if certain cards are banned. At least not on that large scale. It might look like that in theory but keep in mind that a cards price also changes depending on in how many formats it is allowed. Dual lands being legal in frontier and mostly played there and in Std are in no comparison to fetch lands played in every format they are allowed in and basically in multimultiples in almost every deck.If fetches get banned in frontier do you really believe the other duals will rise to price of fetches? I definitively doubt so.,mtgfrontier,dcu34f2,0,t5_3gjom
10465080,0,t3_5pw17w,It really depends. I personally believe that grixis ensoul is almost a free splash and tezzerets touch with fatal push make it totally worth it. However you have to be prepared to lose a few percentage points in certain matchups to sometimes tripping over your own mana base. If it were me and I had all the fetches I would go with grixis. Otherwise izzet is cheaper and a little more streamlined with a glass cannon effect. Hope this helps!,mtgfrontier,dcubnb7,7,t5_3gjom
10541394,0,t1_dd2pitd,Glad we can help! Also forgot to mention that you dont have to go mono blue. If you really want  Reservoirs in your deck the best way to gain life with it is to cast a spell hold priority and respond to the Reservoir trigger by casting another spell. You can do this for as many times as you have cards and mana but it only works with instants or spells with flash. The text for each spell youve cast this turn is checked upon resolution of the Reservoir abilities so if you for example cast  spells in a row in the above way you will gain  life instead of       instead of     . Blue is good with this strategy because counterspells can protect the Reservoir card draw can find it and even if counterspells are dead you can use them to increase your storm count by countering your own spells then countering your counterspell with another counter.,mtgfrontier,dd2zgaf,1,t5_3gjom

10755469,0,t1_ddp92ef,So Unlicensed Disintegration is amazing. Its not the removal or the damage that makes it so good but both. Its one of the best removal spells in the format and has a free bolt attached. The issue with trying to kill before worrying about removal is thst unlike modern affinity our best threats are gonna get us twoforoned because of Ensoul. UD allows for some main board removal to get rid of anything thats making attacking more difficult and also helps burn out the opponent.Also metallic mimic is a great card but I really dont think this is the deck for it. Because the creatures have a lot of different types youre not getting the constant counters just a few here and there. Scrounger is one of if not the best creature in the grixis version because it is at a wonderful intersection of aggression and recursion. It attacks really well and just wont stay dead.As for touch its copies  of the best card in the deck. Chief is good and I did test with him but the raw power of the touches is just better I feel.Bluered versions of the deck are still quite good but UD is one of the best removal spells in the format killing anything and also getting in damage Scrounger is one of the best aggressive creatures in the format and touch gives you multiple extra copies of Ensoul which is what makes the deck so good. I personally feel those three cards means that adding black just add so much in terms of power level.,mtgfrontier,ddpcgf8,2,t5_3gjom

10833121,0,t1_ddwz0gm,Most abzan lists at the moment are running some number of Sorin Solemn Visitor who provides quite a bit of lifegain even just the turn he comes down also Ive seen very few wingmate roc atm the five mana investment that does nothing the turn it comes down is often a bit slower than most abzan lists are looking to be. That being said I think abzan running early pushes into charms and murderous cuts with maybe some sort of anguished unmaking utter end or the like should be able to deal decently with scales.As with any synergy deck if you can isolate the pieces theyre generally not as powerful. Stuff like stain the mindinfinite obliteration for snek is a decent option against them and phyrexian revoker naming ballista or Kalitas to shut down hangarback walkers can give you big game.Grixis or Esper are generally the most true control of the control decks in the format as opposed to something midrange control like Seasons Past Abzan with languishes or something. Generally speaking very hard control decks are going to be the best against synergy decks because you can deal with each piece in isolation as long as you can get into the midgame read no large mana stumbles etc. You have a lot of removal sweepers and counterspells to ensure that they cant take over the game through some sort of rishkarballistasnek engine since they really cant resolve so many permanents at the same time. Generally speaking the best way for them to push through control is by dropping an early scales which is both fairly resilient against most control at the moment and enables some of your fastest draws and then either killing before control can stabilize or trying to grind out value things like inspiring charge or tireless tracker come up decently here thanks to the onboard scales. Since most snek decks have been leaning away from scales in any GBx deck I havent seen more than two scales recently this can be pretty tough to do consistently.Im somewhat wondering if well see some more anticontrol measures like a Mastery of the UnseenDen Protector package or perhaps Gaeas Revenge start to appear in snek sideboards. Its a little unfortunate that Mastery and HangarbacksBallistas have such poor synergy though.On the other hand I dont play scales at the moment so my read could be a bit off base but cheers .,mtgfrontier,ddxcz5q,1,t5_3gjom

11768273,0,t1_dgtltnw,It does but delve will never reduce spell cost to less than  and so far the closest to free spells that frontier has are the expertise cards definitely not free because youre paying mana for them and as foretold definitely not free because of the setup required. Oh yeah theyre pretty much never going to just flat rule anything out but itll be years if not longer til we see a turn  dork again. Why wouldnt homogenizing of power level matter? Its pretty relevant for an emerging format with a comparatively small card pool since it influences how likely it is that new cards become competitive. In modern aggro control and midrange are much further from each other in terms of competition than they are in frontier. This is partly a function of how much much better in modern a proactive strategy is than a reactive one or even a proactive strategy with reactive elements in modern.gtAnd if frontier is similar to extended in function which was not popular enough why force it?Hard to address if you dont agree with the if that the statement is predicated on which is where Im at. Frontier as a nonrotating format is inherently dissimilar to extended.,mtgfrontier,dgtyqcn,3,t5_3gjom
