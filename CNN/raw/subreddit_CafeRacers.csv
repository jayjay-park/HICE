1820836,0,t3_2fdrs9,Of the bikes you have listed the Spectre is the big loser and the XS is the winner.  It needs a fork brace IMMEDIATELY but at least it still has the stock airbox so you can rock the stock carbs for a while.  Make sure nd gear is OK thats a minor weak spot on those.  The next upgrades would involve aluminum rims with an  rear but thats fairly cheap at MikesXS progressive rear shocks at  long and at the same time as that more fork work such as progressive springs and maybe cartridge emulators.That is a wonderful exhaust on it but I hope he rejetted the carbs to match!!!  The big power upgrade on the XS is a set of Mikuni VM carbs  Speedmotoco has a nice kit.The Honda  chain drive bikes arent too shabby. The  KZ is going to need suspension help to work OK and Kawi frame of that period werent known for stability.

1968076,0,t1_ckqak5h,I mean...is it really an option? It just seems like youre underestimating the amount of work that goes into making a tank. You have to have some way to cut and bend the metal that requires expensive fabrication tools and experience to do it symmetrically and correctly. You have to be good at welding. You have to be able to integrate a sealed fill hole system. Not to mention you have to do this all extremely precisely and make mounting holes so it will fit the bike the way the original did without interfering with the bars when theyre turned fully either way.

9438256,0,t1_d9ccj5m,Yeah Ill take a look at your parts list. As I said Im not a pro but Ill look it over and let you know if anything jumps out at me. It is usually easier to use a regular battery but easier isnt always better. Normal batteries have tons of downsides too. You definitely should be able to get your setup working and when you do you will have a nice modern electrical system on your ride. Also if you do have a short in your wiring somewhere it doesnt matter what type of battery you are using. I think its best to narrow down where the issue is and tweak one thing at a time.Edit. Just checked out the album. Nice bike! And yeah wow. Glad that the rest of the bike is OK.  You said it was the second time a battery has failed in the same way? How long did the first one take to fail? Similar amount of time? Was there anything similar between both times? Maybe a hard downshift or missed gear? Causing revs to spike?  That could indicate a charging system issue. Or hitting a big bump crossing train tracks rough road? Might indicate a loose wire or a short.,CafeRacers,d9cd61x,1,t5_2rudz
