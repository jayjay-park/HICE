They ended up in your library for some reason so they should be played. You could simply put them aside until you have completed a good portion of your other unplayed games and then go back once the feeling strikes.,FRAGCAKECHALLENGE,cekbi45,3,t5_2vpnc
118115,0,t1_cerrt8y,Well for story I have to say To The Moon I dont want to spoil it but It is very engrossing however it does lack actual game play you pretty much just click through. But for game play I preferred Splice. An excellent and unique puzzle game that I just kept on playing until I hit  I cant recommend it enough.Also a word of warning for a few games not that they are bad just pricing Windosill and Lume are very few fun and interesting interactive games however they only lasts about  mins so if you want to pick it up get it at a low cost. Also Eets Munchies a clever lemmings like game however ended very quickly with only  levels. I would recommended all of these games but try to shop around and get them for the best price possible. ,FRAGCAKECHALLENGE,cervqfr,2,t5_2vpnc
