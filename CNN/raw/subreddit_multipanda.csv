700303,0,t3_225sl9,Its not that only I can see instability in my hash rates.. My miner is about MH sometimes when I check it I see it around KH whislt the WU is High!! Even the rejection is higher on this pool. Ive been mining Doge in multipool.us since the start my hashrates are stable and the rejections are rare. But is it due to the swap from coin to coin?Can anyone confirm?,multipanda,cgjvkqg,1,t5_314fe
786978,0,t3_235uko,We are still working on the frontend layout. One of the major change that is planned is the ability to expose all data through an API so that anyone can make widgets or apps or even better full frontends for the pool given that almost all our data is completely public including mined blocks and transactions.The problem with current graphs is that they have confusing dynamic scaling that make the fluctuations appear much bigger than they are.,multipanda,cgtqexx,1,t5_314fe

1508821,0,t3_2bh8tc,FWIW I had the same issue for rounds  and  then  was normal and now  is looking a bit low as well. Might just be large price drops in the mined coins before the round end hard to say.,multipanda,cj5emlh,2,t5_314fe
