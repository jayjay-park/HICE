632160,0,t1_cgc4cds,Yeah our method is pretty similar. The challenge comes in scheduling a series of big jobs that will require multiple days worth of parts so that there is no overlap or downtime.,machining,cgc4la8,1,t5_2svm0
741632,0,t1_cgoes7z,gt Spec the parts and let the machinist worry about how to make them though. Understood.  But I want to design parts that can be made from stock material.  I have another part to be milled from a  X  ABS bar which has a thickness tolerance of  . so the max finished thickness would be ..  Perhaps I can find a higher spec ABS bar.WRT the part to be made from   ABS sheet it is overall  X  very irregular shape with  of the material removed for holes and cutouts.Both parts will be used to modify a fiberglassepoxy  composite experimental aircraft instrument panel.  The ABS will be epoxied to the fiberglass panel where it overlaps at the edges.  The overlap varies from  to .  The ABS sheet will also be epoxied and screwed to other parts in the Z direction.  I can tolerate a little initial warp as long as I can flatten it out when I assemble the parts and then Id be happy as long as everything hung together and did not delaminate.  It will be black ABS and exposed to direct sunlight for a few hours at a time.,machining,cgoku8v,1,t5_2svm0
862828,0,t3_23zz72,Depends largely on the shop. I work in a small family run job shop where about  of the machinists program and run their machines sometimes two at a time and in a pretty relaxed atmosphere. There are also larger production shops where they might have  programmer for any number of machines manning them with button pushers who might only know how to do a couple offsets and change inserts when needed with  shifts per day and strict quotas.

Everyone learns at a different pace and different style regardless of level of intelligence. Your instructor sounds like a real prick. And remember you are the person who should be benefiting from school and its your future. The industry needs good people and he is not helping. Explore this site. There are tutorials for basics and some advanced stuff. Use you tube and search things like using a boring head cutting threads on a lathe and such. There are people with machines in their garages who make videos. Please dont be discouraged. It sounds like if someone would only show you what you need to know you would be good at machining.

Doesnt seem likely to me that they intend for it to move fast with those bearings.gt Titanium has a relatively low coefficient of thermal expansion but a stepper motor is going to heat up unless its temperature controlled carefully... how is the machine going to maintain the gap in operation?Differential expansion could be a problem.gt Also arent the properties of the material dictated by their use in the motor?Which is why he wants a nonmagnetic material.,machining,dgifhdn,1,t5_2svm0
