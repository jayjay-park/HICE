2550281,0,t1_cmqt70g,One of the things that I felt was really hard was that my whole life I identified as an American. However when I went to the states people there would tell me that I am not American. It was kinda painful sometimes to have people tell me that.,TCK,cmrgjiv,1,t5_2rxdj

4647466,0,t1_ctgcmnb,Yes it is definitely tricky to change from culture to culture and thats one of those things that just takes a long time to get used to.And I have certainly at times have felt like an outcast with my families. With my Indonesian side its mostly due to the fact that I am too Western in mindset. Ironically its because I am too Easternoriented that I dont always connect with my Western side. Because of this pickle I just do the best to build relationships no matter how uncomfortable I feel. Ive noticed it has gotten better as I get older  either that or I just get more and more used to it. As TCKs I dont think we will ever feel like we are truly at home. But we can learn to get used to it by focusing on the positives of it whenever possible. Just my two cents at least.In what ways do you feel like an outcast?,TCK,ctgdko0,3,t5_2rxdj
4650010,0,t1_ctgdko0,I can absolutely relate! I am too western for my eastern side and yet my eastern culture kicks in when Im in the west  and then Im not really sure where I stand. Im glad to hear it seems to get better with age because while it doesnt tend to show I sometimes feel uneasy because Im not sure exactly what Im supposed to be. I always think it takes a tck to understand another tck so Im hoping Ill be able to make friends with similar backgrounds and find a place where Im not always juggling between two worlds! ,TCK,ctgp28a,1,t5_2rxdj
8303308,0,t3_4t7vsv,Loneliness and friendship are two sides of a coin for us TCKs. On one hand we do know people across the globe but on the other we only have a very small inner circle of friends who actually know us. Its tricky because both the positive side and the negative side of this coexist. Loneliness and international relationships go hand in hand. Its a paradox.It does change though. I moved back to my home country two years ago and while readjusting was no walk in the park the knowledge that this would be home for at least a while was refreshing. It helped me invest in people in ways I never had before simply because its too painful to have to say goodbye all the time when you know youre leaving soon. Now I have friends. Real friends. Its awesome.I dont know what your background is or where you are right now but my best advice for you right now would be to find a TCK group to join IRL. Online communication like reddit is awesome but you need fleshandblood people to truly satisfy your need for human contact. With fellow TCKs I have a connection so deep its astrounding. Ive never felt so profoundly connected with people as I do with those who have a Third Culture. If you have settled down then trust me and please try to find a group like that for you ,TCK,d5fgysx,2,t5_2rxdj

11401546,0,t3_5r1kw7,I am from the u.s. but lived in Italy for some of middle and highschool. When I moved back to the u.s. one of the first things I noticed was also that i couldnt differentiate between a real invitation and a fake one. In Italy people would say lets get together and have lunch next week! and then we would do that. In America people would say that but they dont really mean it. Its just something they say to appear friendly I guess. But it was very confusing and also made me feel depressed and lonely.,TCK,dfocnct,3,t5_2rxdj
