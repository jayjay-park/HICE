1472853,0,t3_2b0rns, year old Canadian here.  First time NoFapWarrior and it feels like a long time relapser.

1525016,0,t3_2bopjp,I was feeling pretty weak sauce this morning. I almost talked myself into giving up. I know that I would have given in under ordinary circumstances. But I decided to go drain my bladder and post in this sub before I did anything Id regret and it saved me. Rock on you guys. I wont let you down.,VioletRegiment,cj7frqq,2,t5_30ga9
2384946,0,t1_cm5zqjs,I feel you brother. I noticed something similar today every time I look at a woman I seem to be drawn to her sexual features immediately not in a perverse creepy way however and I feel like this has prevented me from actually trying to develop an interest in who she is as a person. Its unsettling but can be fixed and is what we have all enlisted in this war for. Godspeed my friend.,VioletRegiment,cm6hkgu,3,t5_30ga9
2387128,0,t3_2mqq8j,The fact that weve already lost two today is disheartening but is also a cruel example of the fact that relapse can happen at anytime and PMO is always looking for chinks in ones defense. Stay vigilant Violets.Over and out.st Battalion Colonel Argenti Stellam,VioletRegiment,cm6r9ec,1,t5_30ga9
2408432,0,t3_2mza6z,ampnbsp Shortly after I posted yesterdays text I realized something I wish I didnt I was home alone. Being home alone is one of my two greatest triggers the other is the internet being out When the internet is out I use the data on my phone in my bed until it comes back on usually devolving into PMO. So I started panicking. I thought to myself just keep browsing just ignore it... why isnt the internet loading? The internet just failed.ampnbsp Of course I started to panic more and my addict mind thought no one will know... So I turned on my phone. The screen lit up I opened up an incognito window and... ampnbsp No I will know. Violet will know. I cant let either of us down.ampnbsp I closed my screen threw my phone on my bed and ran downstairs looking for a distraction. All my reptilian brain could think of playing were the games where I knew there was something that could flip the final switch in my brain................ampnbsp Well I guess I have another Assassins Creed Black Flag profile to play through.ampnbsp How are you Colonel?,VioletRegiment,cm9e3am,3,t5_30ga9
