4765314,0,t3_3fvnfb,Im gonna pop my LSGMedia reddit cherry with my top   films noir for varietys sakeIn a Lonely Place  HOLY SHIT this movie.  Double Indemnity  Maybe the best example of film noir there is.  The Lady from Shanghai  Orson Welles and Rita Hayworth. Done.  Dark Passage  My favorite BogeyBacall flick. Interesting uses of perspective.  A Colt is My Passport  A Japanese import..basically film noir on acid.  ,LSGMedia,ctv7myv,1,t5_38wfo

5114903,0,t1_cv1t5dd,I like it too. Kind of has me hoping this show doesnt eventually end up in the same formula of a band of survivors roaming from place to place like TWD. Maybe the East Coast doesnt suffer a total collapse or is it just taking its time getting there? ,LSGMedia,cv2jcid,1,t5_38wfo

5143795,0,t1_cv58fz2,We hate them Germans so much that German shepherds are called Alsatians here PThose guys in those videos are not fighting back in case they get shot by the trigger happy u.s police haha!!!If the zombie can take a shotgun point blank to the face Im sure a dog bite would do zip to it!! Once I had a run in with a German Shepard... Jumped at my face and I instinctly grabbed its throat and held it away... Stood on its back legs trying to chomp me! But it was basically nullified in that position and I could have easily torn its throat out... But I didnt I just stood screaming for help like a girl until the farmer arrived P,LSGMedia,cv60q8i,1,t5_38wfo
5573516,0,t1_cwn74dm,By all the deities ever worshiped by Man yes!  Yes its true the original film was meant to stand alone but Evil Dead II and Army of Darkness are well worth the effort of viewing.

5696292,0,t3_3t0veb,There were a lot of things being set up for later. Dont want to go into it as its comic book stuff but I think this episode will seem more significant later. Doesnt really help at the time of viewing though!,LSGMedia,cx36h92,1,t5_38wfo
5726540,0,t3_3tk285,I agree with almost everything you said.   I loved this film as well.   The only thing Id say is I HATED how little time he spent with old lady Murph. She was so much Daddys little girl but when he finally sees her again hes all Ew  old people  gross.   Gotta skip  granny  see ya? And he says literally nothing to the rest of his family members that Murph popped out of her body? Hes not interested to hear about how her life turned out at all? And what possible romantic connection did he really have with Hathaway to impel him to go back and live with her on an empty planet? ,LSGMedia,cx6xln5,1,t5_38wfo
5730184,0,t1_cx5srmr,Agreed that this season has really been great. I was iffy for most of the first season but the last few eps hooked me and I have loved this one. If Kevin comes back like one of those dead birds I am ok with that bc I think the show set a precedent for it. But if he is actually dead I am ok with that too bc I think the show can do a lot with that as well. I mean obviously we saw Patty plenty after she died.I re watched the scene with Virgil like  times it was just so surprising and so well done!And I LOVE Carrie Coon. Never enough Nora for me in this show.Dean gave up on the show season  but I secretly dream of podcasting about it one day. So much to unpack and talk  about every week. I will have to check out Baldmove... I need a Leftovers podcast in my life!,LSGMedia,cx7dvi0,1,t5_38wfo
