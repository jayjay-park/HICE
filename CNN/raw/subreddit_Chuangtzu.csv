Maybe from an organ in my body? I wonder if good advice can come from even our pineal glands! this is strangely familiar from a strangely unfamiliar source lol. You might find this interesting. I found it on one of those click and click and click internet escapades.I was wondering today actually how philosophy deals with issues of selfconfidence so its interesting that your recent take away was related to the same subject I was pondering. Some people get confidence from putting others down for example. In one way you might even be able to translate for the fun of it that is the Tao Te Ching and Chuang tzu as confidence boosters where instead of your happiness not being shaken by anything but your confidence because you dont rely on anything. Anyway its interesting!I love the Robber Chih story! How dare he not put it in his book! How Bono of him! Its Chapter  and Ill quote a little To guard yourself against thieves who slash open suitcases rifle through bags and smash open boxes one should strap the bags and lock them. The world at large knows that this shows wisdom. However when a master thief comes he simply picks up the suitcase lifts the bag carries off the box and runs away with them his only concern being whether the straps and locks will hold! In such an instance what seemed like wisdom on the part of the owner surely turns out to have been of use only to the master thief!I will try to explain what I am saying. What the world at large calls a wise man is he not really just someone who stores things up for the master theifOh crud I have to go to the hospital for someone...  sorry couldnt finish,Chuangtzu,ciopqfx,2,t5_328da
