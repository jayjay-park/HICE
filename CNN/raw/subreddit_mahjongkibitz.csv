4088570,0,t3_34hkvi, AKS. BKyuuAA. Cj. Dshun.I got myself into safety  only to piss it away again in one hand.  My mentality wanted a push to get that win but of course it led to destruction instead.,mahjongkibitz,crmbljv,1,t5_31irb

5046115,0,t3_3j70gs, Ateu. B. CKyuuAA. D.After grabbing the lead early I get hit  times to lose.  Ugh.The worst one was the chinitsu when it was blatantly obvious.  I even hesitated on the man but I end up clicking on it anyways.,mahjongkibitz,cuu8y4s,1,t5_31irb
5724894,0,t1_cx59w39,Hello!I would love to see some serious discussion developing here.I looked through your first game and i instantly saw some discards that i would have done differently.You should always start by discarding useless winds. What was your reasoning in the first round to hold on to west wind for so long and instead discard all kind of simples dragons etc?The same goes for the second round you should just discard useless windsthe ones that are not round or you seat wind and not start by discarding simples in suits.I can only recommend to read up on tile efficiency. There is a great article series on this here I think you would instantly see improvements after spending a few hours reading through this.,mahjongkibitz,cx6q9fb,1,t5_31irb
5730213,0,t1_cx6s1hx,Yea when I lose Im on the very same boat.  Its that nasty feeling being irked after falling from a hand  and somehow someway the mind is saying Gotta make that up.  Gotta make that up.  But the end result produces something worse.,mahjongkibitz,cx7e06p,1,t5_31irb
5803971,0,t3_3rew66, Aganben. BLalawel. CKyuuAA. D.Got disconnected on East  and dropped into mangan.  But yknow what?  I would have dropped that pin cause of muh tenpai and muh honitsu.  Likewise two of us were going for honitsu on sou and it was very obvious.  However if I were to break that tenpai then the sou would probably have been the best choice.  The sou pon as well as numerous discards of sou.  My possession of the last sou rules out any  waits.  A kanchan wouldve been difficult.  Finally its safe against at least one person.  Anything else would have been flat out ludicrous.West  saved my butt although I nearly blew it by hesitating and eventually declining a couple tile called to bring me to tenpai.  Thankfully the timing was just right.,mahjongkibitz,cxgjcvh,1,t5_31irb

Utterly disgusting.Sometimes my riichis were ideal waits yet they still failed.  Other times my same causes for losing deal in by misreads.,mahjongkibitz,d9l8ztw,1,t5_31irb
