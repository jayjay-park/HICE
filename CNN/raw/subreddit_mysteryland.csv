1094452,0,t1_chskp07,I asked the cop about the drug dogs he told my girlfriend and I that they were puppies and still in training.  I believe they were about  months old but i dont really remember what he said.  Their mother was their however and some people were unlucky enough to have her sniff their car.  One of my neighbors said one puppy went into their car sniffed our and grabbed a jerky stick and ran underneath the car.  Security was rather chill and reasonable from what I saw.,mysteryland,chsoyu0,2,t5_2vsl3
