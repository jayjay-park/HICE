1011614,0,t3_25oldj,Its a bit shitty for the city but not as shitty as the tactics the cops use to pull people over and bust them on the highway outside the park. My friend got pulled over for not changing lanes while a cop had someone pulled over  mind u the cop car and the car being pulled over were way off the road on the shoulder and there was heavy traffic. A second cop was just sitting there waiting for that ticky tacky bullshit. If these lawyers are standing up for constitutional rights and educating people on the rules of the road especially out of state people then good for them. But more than that Im pissed off at the fact the cops have a trailer set up inside the park to process people for misdemeanor offenses and all the narcos posing as festival goers. That small town makes a ton of money from scamp attendees dont get so fuckin greedy mr mayor. ,scamp,chja0p9,9,t5_2vobq

7561462,0,t1_d31o3nv,Yeah it really isnt bad. Honestly its kind of better than most festivals. Im not one to drink a lot before going in the gate so the fact that I can bring my own booze to camping at other festivals doesnt help much. And then I end up buying  beers inside. Whereas at Scamp I can carry the case around and drink  beers all day.,scamp,d31p9z1,1,t5_2vobq
