5651472,0,t3_3sicou,This is a problem with any geeky culture or subculture. They cant help themselves when it comes to spending money. Colin Moriarty has been discussing this recently in regards to bad games and season passes. If you eat a certain brand of food his example being Tropicana brand orange juice and you hate it youll never buy Tropicana orange juice ever again. Gamers however will complain about season passes and bad games from certain companies but theyll keep buying the passes and games. They literally have no self control.    Remember the Modern Warfare  boycott? Over  percent of the people who joined the boycott group on Steam bought the game anyway. We keep getting shitty shit from AAA publishers because gamers will buy literally anything you give them if theres enough marketing. ,gamers,cwxmbv7,1,t5_2ql62

7066022,0,t1_d1h9mup,Not great. The game does a few things really well but fucks up in other important areas. Ive held off on requesting a refund thus far but only because Im waiting to see if the devs who do appear to be listening to peoples concerns actually manage to correct any of it.Foremost the game has almost no sound design. The metal soundtrack is fucking awesome but there are very few and very low quality sound effects. Because the music is so loud you get almost no feedback so it feels like youre just kinda floating through levels to music.Enemies arent interrupted by attacks so they can hit you back even if youre actively attacking them. Theres a backwardsdashdodge function but it operates so slow and provides no immunity frames so its completely useless. This becomes a huge issue when you run into large enemies since they can beat the hell out of you in three hits. The controls need to be tightened up significantly. The dialogue is also slightly poorly translated and the game doesnt give you much information to enemy damage states so you can figure out if its time to use a Decapitation move for mana.Neither my friend nor I bothered trying to finish the first level. Until they fix these concerns and theyve already put out a statement saying they will I have no plans to revisit the game.,gamers,d1hanyy,2,t5_2ql62

10777372,0,t3_5tvkrr,Read Masters of Doom. Its a fascinating book that plumbs into the shared history of John Carmack and John Romero. Theres a lot of meat there for a gamer especially for the insights it gives into the growth of early gaming how both men fell out over their games and their impact on the industry today.Also Dungeons and Dreamers which focuses more on other notable people in the field of gaming. Each chapter covers people like Richard Garriot Gary Gygax and others with a notable contribution to the rise of video games but its told more from a passionateaboutthesubject point of view rather than a biographical angle. Really good.If you get a chance here are some looselyvideogamerelated gaming books that are more fictionscifi in nature but compelling reads as a gamer nonethelessDream Park by Larry Niven including the sequels The Barsoom Project California Voodoo Game and Moon Maze Game. They deal with LARPing in massive holographic environments and are compelling reads especially since they tend to tell three parallel stories at once Inside the game outside the game and an overarcing mystery.This Is Not A Game by Walter Jon Williams. Main character is a woman that plans and runs global ARG games until someone starts messing with one. Its a sleeper hit but very good.The Otherland Series by Tad Williams. There are four massive books in this arc detailing a number of people from all over the world that become embroiled in an immense global plot that sees them trapped online. This series predates .hackSign and is very very loosely tied to gaming but I found it to be compelling nonetheless. To date among my top sciencefiction favorites.Bedlam by Christopher Brookmyre. Its a genuinely good book with a little mystery and a whole lot of nostalgia. Essentially a gamerturnedscientist gets embroiled in a mysterious plot against his work and wakes up in video games from the s like Quake. Its deeply funny and a real nostalgic kickback to early shooter gaming experiences and culture. If you can get it on audiobook. Its narrated by a guy named Angus King who has a thick Scottish brogue and it really enhances the book.EDIT Im pinning this thread. Id like to get more responses in here.,gamers,ddrlwj5,3,t5_2ql62
10816492,0,t3_5ugw4y,I just beat it last night. It felt like an amalgam of horror titles.The opening of the game and a few other points along the way feels like Outlast. Youre helpless forced to run and hide rather than fight and everything feels familiar.About rd of the way into the game it becomes more like Silent Hill. Youre not only fighting off an array of enemies but fetchquesting pretty heavily. The pace of monsters is slow and plodding and youre given a few options in how to fight back.About rds of the way into the game youre now playing a mix of Saw The Video Game and Dead Space. Traps are everywhere even if its just spawn triggers and theres a lot of jumpscaressoft cutscene action. Body horror too.Last rd the game becomes F.E.A.R. Big fights lots of enemies and things get really linear heavy emphasis on fucking with you out of the blue.Im not sure theyre going to be able to top this title going forward.

Firewatch in my opinion was included in too many categories and is a pretentious walking simulator with a lifeless story and no conclusion. Along with Inside neither belong on the Game of the Year list especially with Overwatch and DOOM in the running. Uncharted  is likely going to take GotY.Dishonored  is a buggy unoptimized piece of shit with a terrible PC port and has no business being in many of the categories it occupies.SUPERHOT deserves nothing because they took money from Oculus as part of an exclusivity deal and are helping fragment the VR marketplace so fuck them. The VR list of titles for nominees is anemic and should not be lumped together with Augmented Reality since that tech hasnt been worked out yet. Pokemon GO competing with VR? Really? Also The Gallery Call of the Starseed Vanishing Realms Rite of Steel Sairento and Space Pirate Trainer are conspicuously absent from that list which tells me the awards committee isnt taking VR seriously.That Dragon Cancer is likely going to get at least a few rewards based on sympathy since its a game about the game creators kid dying of cancer.
