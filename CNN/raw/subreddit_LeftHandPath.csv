3899882,0,t1_cr0shcu,Thats an insightful question.It was one of the many reasons I left the seminarychurchRHP  years ago.It internalized my total disillusionment. It was a rude awakening. It forced a realization that the much of the world is largely beyond salvaging. The weak will naturally be destroyed by themselves their surrounding environments amp the strong among them regardless amp because of attempts to help them. Like with welfare even if your effort succeeds the recipient becomes dependent upon assistance instead of developing independence.Theres only so much you can do for the world. I realized that I had to focus on the self. If you must help others help the strong. Only they are deserving of assistance.Years later its still a daily effort to put aside my concerns for those struggling around me amp to be more selfish. I was raised to do charity amp selfsacrifice which I now recognize as neurotic behavior. Some habits die hard.I dont blame myself for the deaths of those families but I understand my place in their downfall. If I am to be held accountable oh well. The road to Hell is paved with good intentions.,LeftHandPath,cr0tjzw,1,t5_2sro5
4131080,0,t3_30awhn,Just saved a spider the other day at work pretty big too for where I live ... manitoba. That was Friday ... The day before I was going to do a summoning of the Manes I am going to start working with. Id feel terrible killing it too ... It was trapped in the mens washroom sink I clean and serve at this  year old building it has its share of ghosts... trying to get out. Im only okay with killing living beings for food or protection ... not over it being in my space. We inhabit this Earth together  and most people dont understand that. I took it as a blessing for my work for Saturday caught it in a cup which the lady happily crawled into and set her free in the vines. Happy that I seen her first  ... or him. ,LeftHandPath,crr60sm,1,t5_2sro5
5263887,0,t3_3k5sv6,The Satanic Bible is pretty cool helped me get into the mindset during my daily life. However it is more theory and less practice. The rituals in it are interesting but the author Anton LaVey says they are for psychodrama only to release emotions. Other than that LHP is kinda an umbrella term. We tend not to adhere to normal moral structures and are more focused on getting what WE want through whatever means we can use within reason. I would recommend starting at the sidebar and googling the terms there. Some are sinister and mysterious others are humorous but provide great philosophy and insight into the nature of the world. Either way you got a plethora of terms to start with. For morality and ethics in the LHP Id recommend the Satanic Bible Nietzsches writings and Conversation Between a Priest and a Dying Man by de Sade. Good luck.,LeftHandPath,cvkiqa6,1,t5_2sro5
