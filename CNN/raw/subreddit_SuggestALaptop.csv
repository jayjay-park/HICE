86378,0,t3_1v2n4j,The bottom end Id recommend is at the very bottom  An XCADB.  This doesnt even come with Windows has Ubuntu preinstalled.  It has a . GHz Celeron which is what you get taking an Ivy Bridge CPU and maxing it out at . GHz nonhyperthreaded dual core weaker but sufficient integrated graphics.  It would meet your listed needs.  You havent said what country youre in but if its the USA the price is about  on Amazon or Newegg.  There are other XCA models that have Windows  and touchscreens that are worth considering too at about  and there are other ones with i processors but at price levels at which I recommend considering alternatives see the XLADHT.  One alternative would be the XEDHTPK  which is somehow less expensive than the identical black model.  That was one of the better i options.  Maybe you could do better if Haswell models come out  the XLADHT has a Haswell CPU but other than that theres nothing particularly impressive about it relative to the XE.With an i processor you tend to get  price levels.  I still recommend looking at . laptops then because any larger screen at the same x resolution isnt going to improve the situation much youll just have a much heavier and more fragile device to carry around.  I dont have much personal experience with the current generation of cheap machines and dont know much about which have been Haswellized  maybe search amazon with processor numbers.,SuggestALaptop,ceo9hg3,1,t5_2s4k5

Then buy an aftermarket  GB RAM module and upgrade it yourself to  GB. ThinkPads are durable and easy to repair. It wouldnt be a problem to replace something even out of warranty. The L doesnt have a dedicated GPU. You still could play Stracraft II or Skyrim but on lower settings.The IdeaPad Yp is more consumer oriented. It doesnt have the build quality of the L or TSeries but it wont fall apart as long as you dont throw it around. It has superior specs Intel i quad core decent GPU compared to the L but battery life would be quite low maybe  hours.

Im assuming your laptop to be work related as you indicated with have a gaming desktop dont expect too much out of a laptopThe RAM is soldered to the MOBO for the Yoga Pro  so you cannot just stick another stick of RAM in there into the future. Honestly GB is plenty enough to spin up a couple VMs and compile code as well as play a few light games. but at sometime you will start to get envious of other peoples amount of RAM and just want a little more having the GB will fight this feeling for another year even if it does nothing.The issue of memory really is kind of pointless nowadays because honestly as a student you most likely have a google drive account dropbox account box account etc. Thats also assuming you dont want to access your home PC as a server like all the other cool ENSCCS studentsThe RAM is the only issue and mostly because of penis envy and wont introduce any severe limitations to your career.,SuggestALaptop,cewolie,2,t5_2s4k5

Companies make business decisions based not solely on the cost of components but overall profit margins including initial sale and cost of support. If they sell you something that you call in and complain to support about how it sucks all the time that costs them paying a representative to take the call if they dont you blast them online how they are understaffed. All in all they are making these types of decisions on what combination of components will sell best and you can choose to buy from them or someone else.

Also when I look at it from a side viewing angle of maybe  degrees it definitely looks more orangeish.Really its so slight that it is hard to even take pictures of the problem as the difference in the screens sidebyside does not show up in photos Im taking but in person it is pretty obvious. I think the best parallel I can make is that at full brightness the MacBook iMac  and latitude have a glow like a fluorescent lightbulb and the yp is like an incandescent lightbulb like if you were using f.lux at sunset but not quite as dramatic.Im beginning to think it might just be natural and working as intended but I just have no way of knowing so Ive decided to RMA it.

661282,0,t3_21pqy0,Hi Im a CS kiddie as well. Some of the things Ive noticed that I wish I had in my laptop are. More RAMBetter CPU A lot of the tools I use in my CS courses require some flavor of Linux and since I find it annoying to reboot my computer out of Windows every time I want to do some programming for assignmentsfor fun I have VirtualBox. Running more than one OS at a time requires quite a bit of resources and often times I feel like my poor GB just doesnt cut it.. Screen Space NOT SIZE! x makes me want to cry. Whether it be having half my screen by an IDE and the other half my assignment page or having two IDE projects open at once x makes for very sad times. x on my desktop is the sweet spot letting me program on the left side and watch tv shows on the right. Although just getting a monitor along with your laptop could remedy this just get a better resolution laptop screen. Its worth it.. The Mac Hype This is not completely unfounded. A lot of people say that Macs are ripoffs shams expensive etc. But although youre paying a lot more you are definitely getting what you pay for. Ive had friends whos Macs have died a couple nights before assignments are due just head on down to the Campus tech store most if not all are certified Apple service peoples and fix it the next day. Macs have great durability and look great.But the biggest thing is that you cannot to my knowledge officially release apps onto Apples app store without OSX. I kid you not a lot of potential internship or coop placements will ask if you have a Mac if theyre into the mobile app development market. Having experience on OSX can only help you.Just some things to think about when you look for your laptop good luck! Unless youre real eager to get one soon just wait a couple of months before school starts. Theyll be crazy backtoschool sales and I think dont quote me th gen processors will be out.

Only if you pay extra for the extended warranty with onsite service you would get a better customer service. Furthermore the LSeries arent that well made and durable.

Choose a cheap model check if its certified refurbished preferably with an Intel i and choose a better warranty and service option. Maybe a  year one with NBD next business day onsite service. Regarding the build quality they are on par with a Lseries laptop. You can also take a look at refurbished Dell Latitude E laptops.

Unlike a lot of other machines its quiet enough where I can have it in a studio when Im recording audio. Also Final Cut Pro X is simply brilliant video editing software and only available on Mac.However the only problem is price.  will get you an entry level  MacBook Pro with an i processor and GB RAM. This is fairly low specs for video editing and gaming. Not to mention Final Cut is another ....One thing you can do is check out the Apple refurbish store at Apples website where they have some great deals on gently used stuff they also have a student discount which drops the price by . Or go with the ASUS machine that construktz recommended. Id make my own windows suggestion but I think heshe pretty much nailed it. Its got more than enough power for editing and unlike newer MacBooks it has a disc drive. Plus the great price will give you some money for software. Youll be pretty happy with it.

BOTTOM LINEA  MacBook Pro with a i processor and GB RAM A solid machine for HD video editing however you may be able to skid by with a smaller processor will run you . You may be able to drop the price by a few hundred dollars is you go refurb and add the student discount.

The Y is a gamingmultimedia laptop and it isnt necessarily designed for the type of work youll be doing in school.  That said it would probably work well with the programs neededIm no expert on this but its just not designed for that.  For what it is worth you will NOT look as professional if you use the Lenovo Y in a business setting it has a very gamey aesthetic this may not be a big deal though.Sometimes we can get a little to analytical about cpus and gpus and miss bigger picture things.

2525879,0,t3_2okv4f,Even laptops with a p screen at this budget range usually feature low quality TN panels. If you want a great screen you wont get something with enough GPU power to run PoE which is generally tough at this price anyway. Something like the GT M is so underpowered that its almost not worth having. Id shoot for something with a GT M at least.For something without a dedicated GPU but with a great screen check out the refurbished ASUS QLA which has a really great IPS p touchscreen. Youd still be able to play Civ at low settings and Hearthstone at lowmedium.The Acer VGW is a x screen option though it has a GT M GPU which has a better capability to play CoE at that low resolution. Id wait for the price to drop on this again below  before buying.Ultimately however if youre going to start school in September then I think the best option is simply to wait until then saving up a bit more money for a better machine. ,SuggestALaptop,cmo9pc9,2,t5_2s4k5

2618588,0,t3_2puucb,What your boyfriend says considering programs is definitely true. Because like  of people use windows most programs are written for it. That being said if you just use your laptop for a bit of gaming office work and internet usage the difference is probably irrelevant as long as you play somewhat popular games. And even then you could go for a double boot option Is an apple product way too expensive in terms of hardware compared to a windows one? Usually yes because apple charges you a lot for design and the brand name. BUT the total package you get with a MB by which I mean the great battery life great touchpad nice displays and overall good performance is not much cheaper on the windows side.Id say that a similarly priced windows ultrabook roughly gives you the same experience as a MB so you could check those out e.g. ASUS Zenbooks are very similar in design and performance as the MBA.

2660855,0,t1_cn5vo2d,Well Id suggest the Optimus IVId say the iMQ would be a good choice of processor or the iM difference being the i is a quad core and the i a dual core. I would imagine that the quad core will be more future proof but the i will suffice.GB of RAM to start with then buy an extra stick from Amazon or wherever if you want it because its cheaper that way. This laptop has space for two hard drives plus the DVD drive so Id be tempted to stick an SSD in the primary and get an HDD secondary. Up to you which you choose and whether you buy that separately to save money I havent looked at the price difference.The final thing is the graphics card. The M is rumoured to come out at some point in Q  what kind of performance gains there will be I cant say but what usually happens is that the old M models are sold out then theyll introduce the M at around the same price point in the same chassis. Its something worth looking into to find more detail on the release date etc and whether youd want to wait for that. The problem is you can easily end up perpetually waiting for the next thing because technology moves so fast.Anyway hope that helps and isnt too long!,SuggestALaptop,cn5wgs5,1,t5_2s4k5

Its over what you want to spend but that way you will get a new Broadwell CPU Nvidia GT M graphics and a x display.

4122140,0,t1_crq2w06,Yeah if you want a number pad then you will need a laptop with at least a . inch display size though there are some . inch laptops which doesnt have one like the Dell XPS  or the MacBook Pro .A decent compromise between weight and performance would be the Lenovo ThinkPad Ws I would just upgrade the base model with following parts Display . K x IPS with WWANNothing else. You can upgrade the RAM to   or even  GB and the HDD to a way faster SSD but Lenovo overcharges for these upgrades. The  GB RAM upgrade and the  GB SSD upgrade would cost you around  through Lenovo. You could do it yourself for  or less. It just depends on how techsavvy you are. It is not hard to replace parts on the Ws but it will take some time and work and no you wont void the warranty. You can also get a discount on the Ws or any other Lenovo laptop with a Barnes and Noble Gold Account And maybe a better warranty and service option wouldnt be bad. You can get a  year warranty with onsite service and an accidental damage coverage for  bucks. Its not bad.If you dont mind a  lbs laptop then take a look at the Lenovo ThinkPad W The difference to the Ws is the CPU. It has an i quad core the Ws features and i dual core. If you would see a performance difference depends on the size of the datasets youre working with. I cant say anything about that since Im not familiar with your field of work. The tradeoff with the W is the weight and the size. Its thicker and almost  lbs heavier. I would also only upgrade the display to the same option as on the Ws. Just to give you an impression between the p and the K display xp TN panel on the W and Ws xp IPS display on the W and WsIf you really dont want to deal with upgrades and so on then choose following parts Memory GB PC DDRL SDRAM MHz SODIMM Hard Drive  GB Solid State Drive Opal .

4305000,0,t1_csav228,I think youll get a lot more versatility out of it by looking for one like that. If you get a workstation itll only good at workstation stuff. The battery life will suck and youll be stuck to a desk with a mouse anyway. Get a gaming sort of laptop and itll serve you well as a mobile desktop but understand that thats what youre buying. There is no thin or light workstation in existence and when it does exist itll sell real quick to people with jobs not students.So yes look for a gaming laptop for now but keep in mind this laptop wont be your main venue for working on D models. Eventually youll want a desktop that can do this depending upon how much product design you end up doing. I do all my modeling stuff at home on a computer with an R X and I still wish it was faster. You wont need anything like that until later though youll be fine with a gaming laptop for a year or two.

5935259,0,t3_3wnqzz,gt How will this AMD powered laptop perform Im having issues finding Benchmarks.Its hard to say.AMD allows OEMs to configure the TDP of the FXp according to their cooling solution. An FXp with a TDP on the lower end around  W wont be better than an Intel i with the same TDP. If the cooling solution in the laptop allows to run the FXp at max TDP  W it will be better. But I doubt that Asus runs it at  W. It will be on the lower end.gt  It looks like its very similar so my question is do you think that skylake will have a longer life span than the broadwell cpus to justify the extra  bucks?Yes I think that. For example for the price of the Asus with the FX APU you linked you can get this Acer VNGVG with an Intel i  GB of RAM xp IPS display  GB SSD   TB HDD and a Nvidia GTX M which will greatly outperform the Asus.gt I compared that to the  and there comparable but the  came out on top can any body explain to me how this dual graphics solution would compare in overall performance and again whether or not the true quad nature of the amd cpu would justify getting it over the Intel.Just forget AMD if youre looking for a laptop that can run games. Its not worth the performance hit. Even nowadays most games arent optimized for multi core processors besides some AAA titles. Single core performance will be more important and Intel delivers better results in this regard. Same goes for the GPUs. For  bucks you can get laptops with a GTX M which will outperform any Radeon GPU in this price range by far.,SuggestALaptop,cxxn662,3,t5_2s4k5

6164511,0,t3_3zyg38,gt I know you cant really upgrade a laptop. Does that mean I wont be able to play new games in say  years time if I buy one now?Youre stuck with the CPU and GPU you get on a laptop. With your budget you should be able to get a laptop with an i quad core and a Nvidia GTX M. An i quad core is quite powerful and even in  years it will be a top CPU. The Nvidia GTX M will allow you to run games like Witcher  on high settings with close to  fps or more on mediumish settings. It will run games in  years but you will surely have to play it on lower settings andor maybe reduce the resolution to p. You can check how games would run now on a laptop with a GTX M on this website Scroll down and you will find benchmark scores and fps values in different games.gt Any tips for making a laptop last a long time?Take care of it. Service it every few months and by service it I mean to take of the bottom panel and get rid of the dust which accumulates within the case especially in the fans and the vents. A clogged vent can cut of the air circulation which will lead to overheating and therefore throttlinglower performance. I also reapply new thermal paste on the CPU and GPU every   years or so on my laptops. Other than that keep it away from liquids and dont throw it around. If you carry it around then in a decent protective sleeve.As for suggestionsFor around  you could take a look at the Asus NVWFWT or the cheaper Dell Inspiron  i Both come with an i quad core and a Nvidia GTX M. The Asus just has more RAM though that doesnt matter for gaming  GB are more than enough an SSD out of the box it will boot up and load applications faster which are stored on it and a higher quality display better colour reproduction. Build quality is also better on the Asus.If you can scramble together a grand then you can get a laptop with a Nvidia GTX M. A M is around  to  better than a M depending on the game. As mentioned above a M will run Witcher  with close to  fps on high settings. A M will get close to  fps. Huge performance increase.The cheapest laptop with a Nvidia GTX M is the . Defiance II from PCSpecialist. Upgrade it to  GB of RAM and the Nvidia GTX M GPU and youre good to go. You can save  if you have a free Windows license which shouldnt be hard to get as a student. You can upgrade the laptop later on with more RAM up to  GB and an SSD it has free m. SSD slots.,SuggestALaptop,cyqcb8v,1,t5_2s4k5

7374921,0,t3_4gd1ii,I have the X with an i and while I will say it does have a heating problem its actually not too bad. If youre just browsing or watching a movie its not really going to get too hot. It does get pretty hot if youre playing a medium intense game like CSGO but its mostly on the bottom so you wont mind it too much. Soundwise its pretty quiet even when its hot so if youre using it in the library and the fan kicks in its hard to really notice. Im not sure if its OS or whatever but I think once a month itll randomly bluescreen but its generally very rare. My only big con is that the keyboard has a lower quality thats really only noticeable if youre playing something like CSGO. The WASD keys randomly get held down but I havent experienced this outside of the game so not sure if its really a con since its not built to be gaming anyways.

9448390,0,t3_5a4ahl,Well first to answer your battery life question  this switching is called NVidia Optimus and should be available on any nonGSYNC laptop GSYNC screens have to be run by an NVidia card at all times.Secondly a GTX  can definitely game at K but modern games at K will bring frame rates down a bit  you by no means NEED a  for K but itll definitely do better and is considered a K GPU but the  can run K.Now because your budget is so high you might as well go for a    laptops are  at absolute most.There are GTX  laptops out there already  Clevo MSI and I think ASUS already offer them  with the Aorus X DT v being available in the US this week.If you dont care about weightthickness the Razer Blade Pro isnt for you  its designed as the thinnest  gaming laptop  but a .in thin chassis wont be able to cool as well as a . even with Razers vapor chamber cooling  the Razer Blade Pro is for people who need the thinness.Id recommend Alienware for best servicesupport Sager for most upgradeability or MSI for just an all around nice machine  although Aorus makes a remarkably thin   laptop that cools very well albeit quite loudly that looks very sleek and should come with a K screen sometime in the near future.TLDR To me it sounds like you dont need a  but with  budget why the fuck not? Razer Blade Pro isnt a good choice if thinness isnt high on your list  GSYNC laptops cant do NVidia Optimus GPU switching for battery life.Ordering from XOTICPC or GenTechPC means youll be able to customize the shit out of your RAM and storage so go ham on that  I think the Razer Blade Pro maxes out at GB but everything else should be able to go for GB RAM  and the thicker the chassis the more hard drives you should be able to squeeze in there.,SuggestALaptop,d9dnecg,2,t5_2s4k5

Not to mention the experience of gaming will almost certainly be better unless you have a  inch monitor and use a touchpad on your desktop. So really Id say head over to rbuildapc and build yourself a nice gaming rig then if needed get a cheaper laptop for portability when you need it.If for whatever reason you dont think thats viable for you and most of your gaming will need to be done on the go then look at laptops with nvidias  series cards that are trickling out right now.

Its average its not a deal whatsoever.Edit  For example  Edit  This is a far better deal for your money.It has an i processor GB RAM and GB SSDThe drawbacks of this one appear to be the battery life may not last long Graphics card? and the resolution isnt HD.

10631198,0,t1_ddca9rd,Ive had good luck on amazon as long as you vet your searches a bit. I stay away from items without reviews or with garbledunclear descriptions.As for which Thinkpad I went with the T. Its a bit thick in comparison to recent laptops but it feels sturdy. Ive dropped it a few times and it didnt even really get scratched. Just make sure to get the x screen! Also keep in mind that for Lenovo different suffixes mean different models the Ts is very different from the T and in my opinion not as good a potential value as a refurb.Its also straightforward to upgrade. Assemblyreassembly is straightforward and most of the time not even necessary to get a big boost in performance.Possible upgrades RAM Supports up to  GB. One card is accessible without disassembly through a hatch in the bottom the other is underneath the keyboard but requires disassembly. Storage You can put up to  drives in the T.   Mine came with a  GB mSATA SSD but models with hard disks are also common.   If theres a hard disk its held in a bay on the side and can be swapped with an SSD just remember to keep the rubber rails.   IF theres no hard disk the bay will just be empty and you can still put an SSD in there. The rubber rails are pretty cheap a few dollars on amazon   The optical drive slides in and out easily and you can replace it with an SSD. Youll just need a special caddy which can be found from third parties for  or less. CPU Mine came with an iM which did the job pretty well. You can replace this dualcore CPU with a quadcore I used the iM at about the same level of difficulty as swapping the cpu in a desktop.As for battery life I usually get around  hours but Ive not replaced the battery which has got to be pretty old by now. You can also get an extended cell battery for this.Check out this video Hes got a T but its very similar externally to the T.,SuggestALaptop,ddcizol,2,t5_2s4k5
