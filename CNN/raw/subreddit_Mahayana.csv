To say that only a mirror that is empty of images is a true mirror fundamentally misunderstands the nature of mirrors. And if it is possible at all it would be highly artificial.What of moksha? Why should it be like anything I can imagine? Besides whether I attain moksha or not is hardly the point of the Mahayana. ,Mahayana,ct0n3ns,2,t5_2sr3h
