728802,0,t3_20bci4,People arent happy. Not at all. I lived there until I was  much happier here in the US. My family that does still live there doesnt like it much Im from a Russian Orthodox family and as you can imagine not so easy being a Christian in a predominantly Muslim country. Youre not quite right about the daughters though. The eldest is actually locked up as per her fathers request and doesnt talk to her younger sister as they dont get along. You can read about that here as it is BBC I trust this source.But Karimov holds the country so tightly and with such force that it is so much easier to defect to the US or Russia or any other ex Soviet State that people dont even bother. Theres no point in trying as this country is beyond saving really. Besides Karimov is so old already that itll be faster to have him die and then reform than to just overthrow him.,Uzbekistan,cgn49qg,3,t5_2sayi
2508591,0,t3_2od9px,I found this based on a link someone in rKazakhstan gave and found it interesting. Its a pretty good introduction to Uzbek language although some of it is very dense. In other words you may use it as a reference guide for when you are practicing or teaching yourself. It seems very well written although unfortunately there are minor quality issues like blurry or smudged out letters.Youll also notice its in Cyrillic. Hopefully not a big deal for most of us Uzbek only recently officially switched to Latin letters. My understanding is that Cyrillic is still in widespread use. Also I live in Tajikistan where Uzbekistan is a commonly spoken minority language. Here we have the Cyrillic alphabet in common in fact Uzbek Cyrillic is very similar to Tajik Cyrillic.,Uzbekistan,cmm0eiq,2,t5_2sayi
