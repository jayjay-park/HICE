404925,0,t1_cfmh42x,Wow. Thats quite a bit of DA time. I love SC and DA was the only multiplayer I really put significant time into. I really wish there were still people playing. ,Splintercell,cfmqj6b,1,t5_2robr

2113152,0,t1_cl8dp2z,I know I got really pumped when I saw the trailer in Chaos Theory. And I dont think it matters at all that Hardy is British  hes an actor he gets paid to be different than who he actually is. Im a little concerned though that he might not be old enough to play a seasoned vet like Sam. I hope theyre able to make a decent adaptation fingers crossed...,Splintercell,cl8fdr0,2,t5_2robr
2734487,0,t1_cneh6e8,Chaos Theory is the only one that I havent completed. Just did Conviction the past two days. I loved it but it wasnt like Pandora Tomorrow my favorite. And yeah it was literally impossible to ghost the entire game you were forced into shootouts. I still had fun and it made sense since Sam was on a revenge spree. Still Id like to see the next one be more open,Splintercell,cnewdx4,3,t5_2robr
4588145,0,t1_ct8wj7c,Deus Ex came out  years before it and still had far superior voice synch so how can you call it state of the art if something that came out way before it did it way better? Face it despite it having high production values voice synchronization was clearly not a priority for them kind of ironic for a game that has nearly  hours worth of cutscenes.And your argument using Pong does not work at all because Pong was the first mainstream game so there was nothing really to compare it to Odyssey games and Spacewar were so niche they really dont count so no shit it blew people away. By  gaming was very established and had incredible games out on the market. I mean come on Half Life  came out the exact same year. THAT is state of the art.,Splintercell,ct8xlni,1,t5_2robr
5005786,0,t1_cujaswi,Conviction had the best story of the entire series by leaps and bounds.  It wasnt perfect and it relied on some video game logic at times but lets not pretend that the other entries in the series were winning Pulitzers.The voice acting and artistic design were the best in the series by miles.,Splintercell,cupdw0y,1,t5_2robr

5353767,0,t1_cvvzvz2,Because the port is still bad. Just because its not the same as the older gen version doesnt mean its not a bad port.It suffers from crashes has awful hud scaling for  resolutions missing a lot of resolutions controls are wonky might just be me and overall the game isnt very good compared to the other versions.,Splintercell,cvw05u6,2,t5_2robr
5609045,0,t3_3rv3bb,Its because there is no underlying vision for the entire franchise like Hideo Kojima provides for MGS. Also I think the newest games take into account that not everyone has played the older games and a lot of the story has faded from memory. Its a pity but thats just the way it is. ,Splintercell,cwscucz,6,t5_2robr

6803382,0,t3_48uzcf,They just need to bring back humor.  And stop appealing to the mainstream the mainstream doesnt care about splinter cell its the hardcore stealth community that buys these games.  Appeal to your niche and youll find success.,Splintercell,d0nggkq,11,t5_2robr
7624430,0,t1_d38us5r,Yeah I remember it being very troubling the last time I played. IIRC the flash bangs need to perfectly timed off some of the pillars so that all the guards are affected by it then you can run through. But yeah Ive definitely had my fair share in Rambo style moments P,Splintercell,d38uv17,2,t5_2robr
7666121,0,t3_4jauje,I wish. I would pay full price for Chaos Theory HD remake with SvM servers... Bring to current gen please! Or just make a new Splinter Cell with Chaos Theory style multiplayer slower pace,Splintercell,d3dlefg,1,t5_2robr

8665230,0,t3_4yltrn,That sounds like exactly the kind of necessary creative decision that big entertainment franchises almost never dare to make. I completely agree with you but obviously theres fear that changing such a major thing would hurt brand recognition or some bullshit like that.Switching settings or main characters in order to keep it fresh while keeping the tone consistent is of course always risky. Theres always gonna be a certain demographic abandoning a given franchise because they dont like the changes.,Splintercell,d6ortkr,4,t5_2robr

10816797,0,t3_5u7i1r,Since I see you already got it I think it does. Havent played it in a while though. Some of the missions can be really difficult the first Chinese Embassy mission the Presidential Palace and the gameplay can focus a bit too much on trial and error. Pandora Tomorrow and Charos Theory were more open ended in level design and consequences in that there were multiple ways to get from A to B.,Splintercell,ddvocyw,1,t5_2robr

11608210,0,t1_dgbgbw1,I see it more like someone making a cool costume and somebody trying to shit on it for no reason other than to be a douche. I say some games are dumb sure but I disagree because if I developed video games I would have a way better understanding and could criticize the game way more than I could now.,Splintercell,dgbstzq,2,t5_2robr
