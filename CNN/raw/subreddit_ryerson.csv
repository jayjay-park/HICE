Its a dumb fucking campaign thats been pushed by people who are at least allies of the third wave feminist movement.Once you take away rape hysteria its pretty clear that uni campuses dont have a rape epidemic or any kind of obvious problem any more then youre going to get a thief or someone whos willing to physically assault someone else. Crime happens is what Im saying.gt More like its a joke something to be laughed about.Enthusiastic consent is a joke something to be laughed about at the expense of those whore trying to push the concept.The same goes for the whole consent is sexy campaign.gt where they taught us how to prevent racism and sexism and other bigotry on campus. But their exercises were just more inciting these acts rather than deterring it. It got us to try and point out whats wrong with lesbians or black people when they were supposed to be showing us that those things dont matter and everyone should be treated the same.Sounds like a load of crap more then anything else. LGBTs are special untouchable people and they pretend that AfricanCanadian blacks are the only people whore POC outside of Aboriginals.gt The reason the girl above might be against me is that she hasnt seen the side of the RSU where these policies are made and upheld. The policy may say one thing but it doesnt necessarily mean they uphold it to the fullest.That user you mean? I guess she must be. If shes a third waver or sympathetic to that sort of thing shes undermining the crap narrative in the sense that she admitted to the fact that women arent exactly commonly harassed in any way to say the least.,ryerson,crkizg8,4,t5_2qm3w

7667366,0,t3_4k3z1d,I wrote this on another post asking about the nutrition program so Im just gonna paste it here as wellIts a lot of biology related courses so if youre into that then thats great. Physiology organic chem and food science are the toughest first year courses.I heard in third and fourth year most of your classes consists of presentations and projects.Also keep in mind that although there is lots of science required there are lots of other nonscience courses required in this program as well. Theres about  students per year in this program and  are female. And a bit over half the students are from high school and almost half the students are mature students. Theres only one time slot available for all your required courses since this is a small program so you wont be able to pick and choose a schedule that works for you unless its for labs. Since each course is offered once you will see the same classmates in most your classes so its easy to get to know people in your program better. There is also a small room on the third floor of KHW called the nutrition lounge. Its where nutrition students can get together to eat theres a microwave chill and work on projects together. If you are considering applying to the dietitians of canada internship in the future Ryerson is a great school for that with lots of resources and help. But you have to keep in mind that the internship is very competitive so you need to be involved in many extracurriculars. Its also good to develop a relationship with some of your profs because youll need them for your reference letters.

11066657,0,t1_demduum,You can do a course a month easily if you spend like  hours a day doing it.  You should be able to get a high enough percentage if you are taking that many courses to get into any university except maybe Waterloo.,ryerson,deme8fw,1,t5_2qm3w
11083991,0,t1_den9wwb,Hi there thanks for getting back to me.I am currently a grade  student from Ontario so I would hopefully be entering straight from high school. I am still enrolled in a couple courses this semester that could possibly bump my average up to an  but I assume that still puts me in an unlikely spot to getting accepted. Are there any loosely similar programs like Creative Industries in Ontario as I am aware Ryerson advertises this program to be the only one of its kind in Canada. I am really interested in the music industry module as well as a couple of the media modules that are offered in Ryersons program. ,ryerson,deoczpu,1,t5_2qm3w
11122104,0,t1_desndd2,Government and Intergovernmental org statistics are what researchers use there are also scholarly data sets.I think the broader point uhexiia is trying to make is that using something like StatsCan wouldnt count towards a journal requirement which is what undergrad assignments usually have. Theres a distinct set of criteria for what constitutes a scholarly journal and while reputable and widely used StatsCan data isnt an academic journal.,ryerson,desojjw,3,t5_2qm3w
11142450,0,t1_deuz0tr,I dont disagree with what he says but what I am saying is how this Ryerson specific? How is what he said specific to our university? He said it within the university but it is not specific to it. You have not answered my question. But looking at your history its either spam or youre hoping for karma.I agree with what he says but this isnt specific to our university. ,ryerson,deuzhhm,5,t5_2qm3w

11559565,0,t3_64b1xn,If you want to meet the people and get the full experience of university get involved in student groups or societies. I transferred into my current program from a fine arts program where I didnt participate in any extra curriculars. I would just commute to school and go home and it felt pretty underwhelming and quickly became quite boring. When I transferred programs I made it a goal to get involved at school and it really changed the experience dramatically.I met a ton of people developed my interpersonal skills and most importantly felt like i was part of the school. Theres a special connection you make from student groups and extra curricular groups that makes you feel more at home. Walking down the halls and seeing friends Ive made through these groups is always refreshing.I strongly recommend anyone feeling lonely or bored to try joining a student group. Its not only something you can put on your resume but something you can leverage to strengthen your connection to school life in general.,ryerson,dg6a4kc,1,t5_2qm3w

11789191,0,t3_686vez,Dont look at it as if you wasted those years. You grew matured etc.No matter what degree you have or grades you get job opportunities wont be handed to you. I know several graduate students in different fields who cant find jobs. I also know someone who got their undergrad in art history and started working at an insurance company and after a few years is now making k a year. This is in the states.You shouldnt transfer to Ryerson solely based on the location. Sure its nice to be downtown but you shouldnt decide what school you want to go to based solely on location.You wont have to start over again if you transfer as like uThingsThatMakeMeMad said many of your courses would transfer over.Take a month this summer and really think about what you want to do. And downtown Toronto isnt all that great. Think about commuting the traffic crowds of people etc. If you really love downtown Toronto you can always come down during the weekends or find a place down here to live eventually. Just dont let it be the primary reason you chose Ryerson.,ryerson,dgwcetk,3,t5_2qm3w
