Not sure if there are that many videos on it though. Cameo is definitely the finest work I know of so that would be what youre looking for.Is there a specific reason for your question? Id guess youre looking to learn about the technique? ,stonecarving,daqj7hk,2,t5_2w3wi

You can take your sculpture down to the surf and pick up handfuls of sand to rub on your sculpture and then rinse and repeat.  You can sift the sand into different buckets with different grits if you are really particular.   The Egyptians polished granite this way.  In fact sandpaper is really a modern invention.  However life is much improved with a few simple modern tools....,stonecarving,dfsjdi2,1,t5_2w3wi
