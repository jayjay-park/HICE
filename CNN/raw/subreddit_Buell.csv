442051,0,t1_cfppz1z,Been on a ninja  for the past year and  months. Its a fun parallel twin but I just want more grunt force. I also grew up riding dirt bikes and four wheelers. I feel in complete control of my  already started to get bored but Ive been safely pushing my limits lately for fun. I do live in Florida but Im not too concerned with engine heat. Its a motorcycle not a scooter. Ive been looking at tons of different bikes and really trying to feel out the best next bike for me. Honestly id love to get a triumph that seems to be what would suit me best  I relish the idea of low end and top end power. That being said I think my  does a pretty decent job at it but like I said I am just ready for more. Honestly the only thing that puts me off is the tiny red line it has. I havent ridden one yet and Im sure Id love it but just from my experience riding my  Im not sure how good id feel about the engine roaring in top gear at  mph on longer highway trips. My ideal bike would be super torquey while also being able to cruise calmly at mph without working too hard in top gear. ,Buell,cfql0e5,1,t5_2rud5

1234522,0,t3_288ms1,Whatever the bikes story is you did well. Even if you just break it for parts. Hope it isnt stolen and that the frame isnt wrecked Id be pretty wary considering that paint job.,Buell,ci8i16x,2,t5_2rud5

3014506,0,t3_2untcf,Congrats man she looks great. Seems really clean. Ive been thinking about adding an XB preferably an XBS to my garage next to my M tuber as they seem like theyd be a different kind of fun.,Buell,coaga41,2,t5_2rud5
3789025,0,t3_33qh7a,The bike is amazing. I would know. But I am wary of purchasing an EBR until I know whats going on with the company. They cant support parts for the bike for  years if they dont exist. In fact there is no guarantee that anyone will purchase EBR and continue operations. We can only hope at this time. I would recommend patience. Purchasing an EBR has some risks but the reward currently is lower priced models. Its like gambling but you dont know if the casino is going to pay you at the end of the day or not.Instead I would recommend looking for a used XB. Parts are very much available bike was produced for  years. The installation price for you is very low they sell for k depending on condition. They are very fun to ride. ,Buell,cqo6gap,1,t5_2rud5

6480028,0,t1_czojryt,If the bike cranks and acts like it wants to turn over but doesnt chances are the boot is leaking among other things.  As the other reply stated its rubber and gets worn outcracks that allows a vacuum leak.    You cant tell a whole lot about the boot while its on the bike but if you notice the bands that hold it on are really really tight it could be damaged.  It should be pretty close to flush on both ends carb and engine intake.   Below is a picture of it on the bike...disregard the red text     ,Buell,czpkzd3,1,t5_2rud5

8662154,0,t1_d6kkxvj,Its outlined in the service manual how to check the belts condition.  You can download the  version here.  That should have everything for your model in it as I dont believe major changes happened until .  Im not  though as I have two  models.         Basically what youre looking for are cracks in between the teeth or damage to the teeth.  Some cracks are ok but if you see a ton of cracks that reach the edge its safer to replace.  Although for some assurance I have k on my  owned it since k and had the same belt the entire time.  I only recently swapped it with my other bikes belt  with less than k on it thats been sitting for several years because of a k mile trip.  Unless your bike sat in the sun its entire life your belt is probably fine.,Buell,d6odxq5,1,t5_2rud5
8873229,0,t1_d7e7yr5,I think you are going the right direction. When it dies just it totally dies no lights or anything like the key is off or is it like the kill switch is off?,Buell,d7efqty,1,t5_2rud5

9125751,0,t1_d88p7vp,Thanks for the wellwishing and the tip on the orings. I kind of assumed Id just want to swap em anyway but was unaware of the swole factor. And yeah Im almost tempted to order two fuel pumps just to have one on standby in case it happens again in a few years.  ,Buell,d88rlp6,1,t5_2rud5

11372309,0,t1_dfl0kvt, This is the best I can do at the moment. The pipes arent near as long as the ones you posted but maybe its one of theirs. Im guessing I can pull the cable while its running and see if its connected,Buell,dfl13bh,1,t5_2rud5
