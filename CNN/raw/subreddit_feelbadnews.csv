7073696,0,t1_d1i43i2,You prove the rules of liberal political correctness set forth by Richard Pratt in  and in  the Codirector of the political correctness controlling think tank Institute for Public Policy gave a short speech.    An aside NPR did a history of the invented word from Pratt   .     In the rules of liberal political correctness you do not engage or discuss anything you arecto personally attack them use the made up word in  to attack them  call them names but do not engage in discussion.  Keep in mind this is  this is a co director of the leaders that tell liberals how to think and speak as it propagates from them. He gives an example on how very easy step to destroy any country they want using political correctness. In this example he uses America.     think tank gathering        You will notice all far left big government supporting liberals will never engage or discuss the taboo. Their rules are you personally attack anyone with labels and insults any persons who believe in individualism or wont follow the collectivist liberal political correctness.      Your personal attack instantly proves you follow the rules of the collectivism.       Not that it means anything to you Im quoting real history as that  video proves the rule is to personally attack any non liberal  so I understand you can go right ahead Im not going to attack you back it doesnt make sense when Im arguing about a broken system.   My credentials will mean absolutely nothing to you     years old.     I have a B.SC IT Bachelor of Science in Information Technology with CCNA RampS certification Cisco Certified Network Associate Routing amp Switching I currently work for the company your ISP needs to get online P       One of the main backbone providers     Network Operations Engineer in one of our data centers.             Any IT students especially in the U.S. we definitely have openings  our U.S. STEM fields are so low the US is in a very screwed up situation. But for IT workers trust me as I deal with peering isps from all over US get your certification heck even a Linux amp basic N will get you into most all Netmon departments and Americans are given first priority over any HB as we hire more Americans the HB are released  the culture is changing in retaliation of far left policies.   ,feelbadnews,d1i60k4,1,t5_2u5k1
