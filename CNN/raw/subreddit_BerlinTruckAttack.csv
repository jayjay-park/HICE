10025685,0,t1_dbed2my,gt They are totally allowed to pick the parts of a religion they want to follow.Except  of muslims at least here in Denmark believe one should follow everything islam teachesgt Theyre a problem yes. But are you calling for a ban on Christianity because of the acts of the Westboro Baptist Church?I think its pretty obvious to pretty much everybody who has ever looked at a bible that what WBC does is not required by their faith but if it was yes I would be calling out Christianity as much as I call out Islam.,BerlinTruckAttack,dbedhq2,1,t5_3i2p3
10025996,0,t1_dbeamuc,They are not extremists they are normal moderate muslims.,BerlinTruckAttack,dbeey52,2,t5_3i2p3
10026264,0,t1_dbefobl, If you aim to hit a military target and inadvertently kill civilians you can maybe say it is justified.I sort of agree but when the west started targeting schools watersupplies and busy streets I would say they have gone too far.I have read somewhere I have no sources on this and its just from memory that for every ISIS fighter the coalition kills it kills  innocent civilians. At that point I wouldnt call these accidents anymore.your premise is that killing innocent people for the sake of killing innocent people is justified.Its simply an eye for an eye situation the west killed More then ISIS has killed in europe civilians so ISIS returns it. ,BerlinTruckAttack,dbeg7bw,1,t5_3i2p3
10026275,0,t1_dbefzpj,I know I never said it was a good thing it happend or that it was right all I said its justfied. And how about people would stop focussing on stopping the goverments wrong instead of only stopping ISIS their wrong.,BerlinTruckAttack,dbeg96q,1,t5_3i2p3
10026593,0,t1_dbehho6,Youre really not doing yourself any favors. Youre arent engaing in arguments you belive in the stupidest conspiracy theories possible you dont even give shitty sources but just hint gtwikileaks towards shit that is ungoogleable and as I criticise Trump you just try to deflect towards HRC  the election is over! Your guy has to prove himself now her alleged actions do not matter,BerlinTruckAttack,dbehqup,1,t5_3i2p3
10028341,0,t3_5j990s,Well then you are confused about the motives of the attackers.Whether or not a country accepts refugees is entirely irrelevant to an Islamic martyr. Entirely irrelevant. They do attacks in countries which take no refugees like Saudi Arabia and in countries which are full of them like Jordan.,BerlinTruckAttack,dbepy6g,2,t5_3i2p3
10030289,0,t1_dbeyqvt,So to summarize  You think its appropriate for Daesh to target toddlers in Germany because Germany is part of a coalition that has killed fewer Muslims than either Daesh itself or Syrias Assad or Russia.Did I get that right?,BerlinTruckAttack,dbez2rh,1,t5_3i2p3
10030378,0,t1_dbe8td9,gtActually dont blame a race or religion at all. I mean we dont blame Christians or white people for lynchings done by the KKK do we?Well we can blame Christianity if a Christian causes a terror attack in the name of Christianity. Well we can blame Islam if a Muslim causes a terror attack in the name of Islam.,BerlinTruckAttack,dbezhro,2,t5_3i2p3

10836883,0,t1_ddxmkg0,You complained about lack of empathy. And I only said with less panic and less fear terrorists have less motivation to do such things. And I would say thats a good thing.,BerlinTruckAttack,ddxqxhb,1,t5_3i2p3
