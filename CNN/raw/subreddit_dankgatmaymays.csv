I agree that Switzerland and the UK are different so its hard to make any meaningful comparisons... but at the same time this is what youre trying to do by comparing the US to the UK. You also were relying on gun specific homicide statistics which I claim is an invalid approach if gun control doesnt reduce total homicides then whats the point? Homicides result in death by definition. Saying one type of homicide is more survivable doesnt make sense.According to the CDC drunk drivers kill more people than gun homicides. I guess we should change the subject to talk about restrictions on alcohol? Who really needs high proof alcohol anyway? And certainly no one needs to be able to buy more than one alcoholic beverage per day. Together we can legislate this problem away!,dankgatmaymays,cxmc5wo,1,t5_35ksr
