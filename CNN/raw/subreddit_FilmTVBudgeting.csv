11050029,0,t1_dekhhml,I guess what Im saying is that the problem for execs isnt necessarily the money its the being heard and allowed to go back to their bosses being able to justify their pay in their insecure positions.  That might mean letting them win some concessions you build in especially for them to win on.  You can even direct them towards decisions like I think we may be able to save if we shoot in the UK or wherever you fancy a holiday... Floating the idea that their guidance is valuable letting their fragile egos feed.Cheeky example I did for a producer I knew well but who always bitched about my fees even though I made him decent projects.  Just above my line I included one for  figures for Hookers and cocaine for the director.  Obviously a semi joke but he did skip right over my fee...,FilmTVBudgeting,deki2jq,1,t5_3j8nb
