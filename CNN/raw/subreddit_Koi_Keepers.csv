1301178,0,t3_28yi27,Is it constantly putting its head above water or occasionally? At one time of the day and not others? Also have you actually seen him eating food?,Koi_Keepers,cifzzap,1,t5_2wkh5
1387482,0,t1_ciq7a04,lol  Not too sad.  I dont think the koi mind as long as it isnt harmful.  We had a run in with a crane as well so I rationalize some murky water might not be completely bad.,Koi_Keepers,ciq7b6n,1,t5_2wkh5
4019714,0,t1_cr265l9,Im so sorry Ive been away Im sure my post it too late for it to make any difference to your fish now.  But Ill answer anyway.  I hope that it will help you keep the rest of the fish alive and happy.  Let me start by saying I have no IDEA what youre talking about with regard to floating filters on a pond or a sand filter or what you mean by blower pump??.  Ive never heard of such things. The pond needs to filter  on its own in order to maintain itself.  You should not have to turn things on and off.  Thats just strange. You would likely have some filter media that has to be removed weekly or more regularly and rinsed out.  But since I really dont know what you mean by the description of your filtration system I cant advise you on that any further.  I hope whatever you have not only clears vegetable matter and such but has a biological filtration media that encourages the active bacterias which will keep your water balance healthy and hospitable to the fish.  You will need to read up on that and talk to the people who installed the filtration to grasp HOW your water is being cleaned.  Its key to understanding what to do about your water quality when you run into problems. Secondly I dont know about feeding cheerios to fish they dont require carbohydrates they require protein and vegetable matter.  In the warmer season in order for them to grow you should be feeding them a protein based food for koi. Thats what Ive always been told anyway and have always done.  Putting a flour based product into your water seems like a bad idea to me. Not only is grainflour not part of a natural fish diet its bound to be bad for your water in the long run.   Lastly your water should be tested regularly for quality.  Just because water is clear or lookssmells fine doesnt mean its fine AT ALL.  The only way to ensure your water quality is to TEST and modify the water as necessary according to the test result.  You should be testing for PH NITRITES NITRATES and AMMONIA.  Some people also test for hardness.  I personally do not  You should get a liquid testing set not a stick test kit.  The sticks arent as accurate and dont test ammonia.  At least Ive never found a stick test that tests ammonia.  When you buy a liquid test kit it will come with instructions.  The test kit I have for example is an API FRESHWATER MASTER TEST KIT.  You should be able to find this in any serious fish store or a place that supplies ponds.  Any or all of these measures being off but ESPECIALLY PH and AMMONIA is stressing sickening and potentially lethal to your fish.  The test kit comes with instructions as I mentioned and it also provides some resources for what to do should you find your levels are off.  The PH youd be shooting for as ideal is ..  Though koi can survive in a varying level of PH as I understand from the high s to the low s.  You generally want a middle of the road PH and you want to keep it stable.  Fluctuations arent great for koi.  AMMONIA needs to be ZERO parts per million.     Nitrates and nitrites well thats a very long involved discussion.  Nitrites should essentially ideally be  eventually if your biological filtration is hospitable to the bacteria that eats ammonia.  Youre going to want to do a lot of googling and reading up on the life cycle of a healthy pond with fish to understand the interrelatedness of all these substances being present in your water.  Its way too complex for me to explain here. I found this website to be informative with a quick google  Good luck to you.  Koi are beautiful and can be very rewarding especially when theyre happy and healthy.  That unfortunately requires actual work.  Its not a passive pursuit.  ,Koi_Keepers,creh7s5,1,t5_2wkh5
