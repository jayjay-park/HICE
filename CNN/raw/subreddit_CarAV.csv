79549,0,t1_cenhdc2,Yeah . and x are the most common so anything besides that is more scarce. You can buy those without a amp and see how they sound and if you want more then you can amp them later. The install is more important than power. So making sure the door is sealed so and the speaker is secured to the door and no air can get out around the speaker ring. So if you want even better sound quality with out blowing the doors off I would sound deaden your door. Or just a little bit of deadener to cover all the open holes like THIS. ,CarAV,cenhhcx,2,t5_2t73y

114624,0,t1_cereehf,An alternator without an upgraded battery is kinda pointless. See what the largest XS Power battery you can fit is or a Sears DieHard Platinum. Both are great. Id lean towards the XS depending on your budget.In regards to speakers to get louder and clearer you will need...you guessed it...more power. You have a pretty powerful amp I think who installed it? Best Buy? if so the gain is probably pretty conservative you could try turning the gain knob just a teeny tiny bit. Otherwise go to a local shop and check out JBL the JBL MSC is a phenomenal set of speakers.For your sub build a proper box. for the love of god build a box for that L tuned lower than hz. If you dont like it then worry about a new sub. Do you have the ability to build your own box? Saws etc? if so a sheet of  MDF is  and should be enough to build two boxes if you decide to. The Sundown SA is a lateral move. I would look at something like a Fi Q or a  Sundown X. Now bear in mind Im not saying the L is the greatest subwoofer of all time and there is no way to go up from an L hell no. However the L is a great sub. There is a reason damn near any one that knows anything about audio has at least heard of a Kicker L. I just dont think you will notice that much  worth of a difference a subwoofer with similar power handling characteristics if all things power wise remain the sameFor anyone else reading this I know power handling isnt the exact determinant of how a sub works. But were talking about an L here. Everyone hates Kicker because theyre huge and built a brand off of livin loud I love my  cvr btw.

168722,0,t1_cexj8tt,First off I am over in PA but I can find the link to the build I did I got it off of the SMD forums and it was actually pretty easy to build if you have the tools.Secondly check your alternator in your car for its amperage rating if you have anything less than a amp alternator you are going to get some headlight dimming and will be eating into the battery on heavy bass drops. I would recommend at least a  gauge power wire run to the back as well as anything less will heat up and will also starve the amp of power. Always check the fuse rating as well when you look at wiring kits most of the cheap kits will say  watts! on them but only have a amp fuse. You want to try and get the fuse on your power wire kit to be as close as possible to the amplifiers fuses without going under that rating.,CarAV,cexnfmb,2,t5_2t73y

I used to be a tire and suspension tech and even though I didnt work with car audio I have still done countless head unit speaker sub amp installations on the side. I used panel poppers and yes solder and heat shrink. In my opinion  sounds quite reasonable for a job that should have a small margin of error. I can get to the speakers in my F in less than a minute yes I did time it.  for an easy amp sub install is an ok price to.

What I am calling you out on is that you are saying that he must match his amps RMS to his speakers RMS else the driver will fail.

577992,0,t3_20qvqs,Boat audio installs are my job and while the principle of it being a water car isnt too far off theres definitely some things to take into consideration.What kind of boat is it? Does the engine have an alternator? Is there a safe dry place to mount a head unit like in a glovebox or will it be exposed to the elements?Assuming the engine has an alternator and the batterys are in good shape it should be a pretty straightforward install. Even if you have a good safe spot for a head unit a marine unit would still be a good idea. The Clarion M is a pretty good marine unit that costs about the same as a car head unit. If you need a kickass rugged marine unit try the Clarion CMD .Marinerated speakers would also be advisable as well especially if you are using the boat in a brackishsaltwater environment. Look for ones that also specify good UV resistance. Polk and JL both offer decent marine speakers though youll pay and absolutely get more with the JLs.You could power them straight off the head unit but as boats are essentially an open air environment you will probably not be happy with the output if you are doing anything more than putting around a quiet lake. If you decide to get an amp get a ClassD amp with conformalcoated circuit boards that will hold up to marine use.After that its pretty much a matter of making sure youre not punching holes in the hull while cutting out for speakers and mounting things. Also when drilling through fiberglass run the drill bit in reverse until you get through the gelcoat then run it in forward to finish the hole. after that come back with a countersink bit and run it in reverse just enough to get the area around the hole down to the fiberglass. That way when you boltscrew to that hole you wont have to worry about cracking the gelcoat.This is probably more than you needed to know but if you have any other questions hit me up.,CarAV,cg5z036,2,t5_2t73y

842038,0,t1_cgzzkqp,youre correct my friend. Ive got the same amp about to go power my front doors as soon as finals are over and I can get out to do it.  ohm impedance minimum if bridged but it is certainly twoohm stable for your speakers. And though  wrms is high for a component set it does say that on the details and theyre priced high enough that I believe their specs.Have you checked the usual suspect? RCAs are going to be the easiest to mess with electrically and can have a huge impact on your sound quality. Can you check to see if the amp itself isnt blowing up? Are you adjusting the gain knob vs the bass knob I dont mean to insult your intelligence but we have to ask the simple questions first? Is your amp properly grounded?

All your car amp does is take the DC power from your car and use those electrons to amplify the AC audio signal from your head unit. Its an extremely basic explanation but thats pretty much it.You could do the reverse too if you had a speaker that could handle it.

But if you can clearly hear it favoring one side Ill assume those arent the issue. Also Im not sure why youd play a hz sine wave when testing speakers something around  khz would more appropriate unless they are dedicated midbass.First rule out the obvious and make sure the fader is set to the middle. Make sure the RCAs and speaker wires are secure. Next I would check the voltage coming out of each channel of the amp to make sure its the same. Then check the impedance of the speaker and make sure it isnt damaged. You can also check the voltage coming from the LR of the RCA cable itself.,CarAV,chkvdt7,2,t5_2t73y

Rattles in the car become most apparent when the sub starts hammering out those upper bass tones. Position your sub where it sounds best im sure you have played with thatSome loose polyfill can artificially increase the enclosure volume thereby slightly lowering the tuning frequency.

1260624,0,t3_28dvjn,just reading the replies on here it is pretty clear you had the amp pushed into clipping. when you tell the amp to produce a signal above its limits it will make a square sine wave which by definition forces the amp to push more power and thus creating more heat from there the amp looses control of the sub and as such the sub no longer extends to full Xmax. due to this the pole piece is unable to reach its optimal cooling position and that excess heat has no chance of being dissipated. in a sealed box there is no air flowing from outside to cool the sub. the type R is a good entry level sub it is NOT a power house that can take abuse. most general audio companies such as rockford alpine kicker ect. will replace a blown speaker even when its obvious user issue. having bass turned up on teh HU or bass boost on the HUamp can all cause such an issue. moving from a higher impedance to a lower will also remove a great deal of the strain on the amp and allow it to more easily produce power. thus the amp can go over its RMS ratting that much easier.I can understand you want to think it was not your fault and that you feel you have done car audio for  years but its apparent that its more of a hobby than a professional endeavor and thats fine a good website i would recommend to cover much of this is BCAE.com that will explain much of this in more detail and also goes into TS parameters that have been referenced in the comments. ,CarAV,cibfp3k,2,t5_2t73y

1334539,0,t1_cijjdig,The length of wire doesnt effect the gague of it by much when we are talking about short runs in a car.  I find it hard to believe where youre  going to put the amp that will make it so close to the battery.    Generally what most people do is run one main wire from the battery in the engine bay to the trunk and then distribute power from it to our amps.    The amp you have requires a amp fuse which means a length of gauge wire would be sufficent for just that amp. but if you wanted to add a amp for your speakers in the future you would most certainly have to upgrade that wire or run a second power wire from the battery.   General speaker amps you would probably be wanting to use would be in the ampamp fuse range. So adding your current amp fuse a to your possible future amp a would be amps total so a total of amps on one wire which would bring you into the gauge wire tier.    If you truly can get away with only ft of wire i say go with the gauge a piece that short is going to be very affordable and gives you lots of breathing room.      ,CarAV,cijr2t2,1,t5_2t73y

1801898,0,t3_2f64xu,Yes. Cheap kits could possibly use wire which doesnt meet up to AWG standards. This means the wires could be smaller than they say they are Or they use thick insulation and make the inner diamter of the wire smaller. The wires are also most likely made from CCA rather than OFC.

1922008,0,t3_2glbpu,Id get it professionally done if I was you. If  you seem overwhelmed just reading the top post it will be a daunting undertaking acutally doing it. No shame though. Get it done then hang around here and learn the theory. Because one you get it done thats not the end of it. If your inline fuse blows what are you going to do? What fuse type do you use what is it rated for? Ive been into car audio for about  years now Ive done it all. Self installs Ive used local shops Ive tried Best Buy. The last time I used BB and they did a good job but they didnt tell me anything after they were done. They didnt tell me the fuse type or what to do if it needed to be replaced. If I was a total noob I would think my amp was broken when it could be as simple as a fuse. And yes the fuse is pretty much the only consumable after your install is finished. But even then thats not the end if you dont want it to be. When you pay someone to install an amp what you are paying them to do is lay down cables in your car. One from the battery to the amp two from the HU to the amp and a ground. But lets say you didnt like your amp and wanted something more powerful. Nothing stops you from swaping amps out. Once the cables are laid youre pretty much free to do what  you want. Let them lay the cables stick around and learn the theory skies the limit or money in this case. ,CarAV,ckksdyr,2,t5_2t73y

These letters notate where you need to fasten radios for either Toyota or Nissan.That black Ushaped trim piece around the sides and under the radio pops right out toward you. There are  phillips head screws that come out releasing the radio pocket and brackets. You need to unscrew the top two black screws on either side that secure the radio into these metal brackets. Now youre ready to install.Place the new radio between the brackets line the front of the radio up with the front of the pocket and it should lightly snap into place in the bracket and youll see where to put the screws back in. Replace the screws into the new radio if the thread is too fine the new radio will come with a coarser threaded screw to use and replace in the reverse order you uninstalled it in.EDIT Sometimes if the radios are too tight to wedge in between the brackets you have to loosen or remove the screws that fasten the pocket in place and just do one side completely at a time.,CarAV,clrr7i4,2,t5_2t73y

2278534,0,t1_cltc0v9,Yeah definitely look at putting an amp in. You can also seal your front doors to help improve midbass response. I would honestly recommend a  channel amp that is bridgeable on  channels that way you can run  speakers or  speakers at fairly high power. If you still feel underwhelmed after installing an amp and sealing the doors then you may want to look at higher power speakers. I guess I should ask what exactly is underwhelming to you? Is it the bass the clarity the loudness? ,CarAV,cltcg2y,1,t5_2t73y

You would know if you have an aftermarket amp by looking at your battery and seeing if there is a large gauge wire coming off the battery that has an inline fuse. It will look a little different than the stock wiring. You would know if you have a factory amp based off of what yearmakemodel your car is andor if you have a little badge anywhere near your speaker grills or on your stock stereo that says Bose or infinity or JBL or Harmon Kardon.

Because its garbage. If you want a  inch sub with the range of an  inch sub then by all means get the sa. This is why people always complain that their midbass is basically missing. Op dont get discouraged youll find out soon enough subwoofer advice is  talking shit about the competition and building up your own subs. It is one of the most subjective fields specially since only a few people actually bother to test their setups. Any of those sub brands are decent. He is bright though k is severe overkill. I run a really mild  rms setup and that can rattle the wipers off the windshield. A true k system would need a  aka  all around.  large batteries something massive like the HC and a amp alt on top of your stock one. Realistically Id shoot for k. You can run  wire here. You can run a single high output alternator  amp range should be good enough and a single HC. As for the subs the Alpine has the best range hz. Realistically probably not too good in the midrange area unfortunately thats just a cost of being big and heavy. Still nice for a sub that big to cover some midrange even if its not great it will make for a smoother transition. The L goes a bit lower but has a much narrower range hz so just make sure you have something to fill that midbass gap. A pair of either will take krms with no problem. As for JL its a nice brand but they dont really offer a great sub in that range. The W would be the best comparison to these. Its a notch above both rated at  watts. Costs probably more than a pair of the other two but very nice sub. I wouldnt overdrive this one though. Id also take a look at the Orion HCCA. Very popular and could do the krms in a single sub. Response range is narrower than the Kicker hz by a hair but it is a ridiculous sub. I think you cant really go wrong with any of them. If I had to pick Id go with the single W but any of the rest will get stupid loud. ,CarAV,cnswnt0,2,t5_2t73y

It was also the only model of that car AFAIK to have Bluetooth and such.The funny thing is that on PACs website it says Not for use with  cars with factory Bluetooth... but yet it still works.  The button on my steering wheel causes the OnStar active LED to light up on the unit and if you try to program it with the SWC it just doesnt work... that button is hardwired into the OnStar module or something.To be honest Im not sure why the place I took it for installation used PAC parts.  Axxess actually supports my car and according to some other posts on carAV other peoples resources suggest Axxess parts as well.  They might have a discount deal with PAC to sell and use their parts? I noticed not for resale stickers on the stuff when I took the trim off to reprogram the SWC module.I could go back there and tell them they used the wrong part and that it needs to be an Axxess unit but the reality is that the PAC just works for the most part just the BluetoothOnStar bit trips it up.And I know why too those idiots didnt hook up the mute wire.  I looked earlier today and the wires still on the back of the head unit not going anywhere.However the instruction manual for the OSCBOSE mentions that the OnStar volume should be controllable by the steering wheel volume controls  as it was with my factory radio.  Its not at the moment.  I doubt the mute wire would affect that.  Hence why Im wondering if theres some OTHER wire that needs to be connected from the SWC to that unit.,CarAV,codqejs,2,t5_2t73y

3399123,0,t1_cpfoc2l,Npdang definitely knows his stuff but I wonder if he still agrees with what he said at the top of that thread regarding the decoupling.  I didnt read it all the way through but see where he said decoupling the speaker from the door.  Im trying to imagine a driver in operation with that setup and what the effects would be.  I dont know.  I dont think Id do it.  I run a lot of power into my doors and I like to run them low.  After a while I think the bass would inevitably squash some of that clay out leaving gaps and a loose speaker.  I mean you could not crank the speaker down tight or youd push the clay out yourself.  So the screws would have to be semi loose.  If you put washers or something in there to create a gap for the clay then your coupled through the screws anyway.  And even having the head of the screw touching the driver is still a slight coupling.  But anyway over time I would think the driver would be exerting a lot of pressure on the clay compressing it and oozing a little out here a little out there until theres an air leak and a loose driver.  But Im only speaking hypothetically.  Hes actually done it so maybe it does work.  Interesting for sure. ,CarAV,cpfq5c2,1,t5_2t73y

3826959,0,t1_cqsf90z,Remember music is dynamic. The amp doesnt just put out  watts to a speaker.  As a song is playing and different frequencies are louder or softerter at different moments of the song the amp is putting out more or less power at each frequency at each moment in time.  And if you have the volume down the amp is also putting out less power than when you have the volume up.

3827708,0,t1_cqserrp,Only way I could honestly get it to fit. The full usable height of my trunk is about  inches the outside diameter meaning the very outside of the sub not just the cone itself is about . inches. That leaves VERY little room and the box would have to be built very precisely with almost no room for error. Honestly I tried to face it towards the trunk lid but I couldnt reasonably do it. The most important factor is that you have to allow the sound to get into the cabin so there needs to be space where the sound can pass through from the trunk to the cabin. If I had faced it towards the lid the box wouldnt have allowed any room for the sound to reflect back into the cabin and would have been far too muffled. With the sub facing up I gave myself nearly five inches or more of room for the sound to pass over the box and into the cabin and I positioned in a way so that sound probably reaches the cabin easier than if I had a smaller sub facing back. In my case it gives me the room I need and almost no difference in sound quality vs rear facing. I also have noticed that is has given me some very different results in terms of flex. I get a lot more... But not in the usual places I mean its more because its spread through the vehicle better. The entire cabin shakes originally my girlfriend was worried it would break the seat mechanisms my dash vibrates like crazy steering wheel makes me look like I have Parkinsons and the roof flex is enough to toss a water bottle in a second. I cant even have anything loose inside the car or it just rattles to the point of insanity. BUT my trunk Barry moves... I had more trunk flex with a single rear facing ... Its quiet weird and I think fairly unique to how I positioned it within the trunk but its definitely not what I expected. All in all its more impressive to most people and I avoid the task of trying to isolate all the noises that would usually come from the rears. I did have to rig something to keep my quarter panels from sounding like two pans banging around thoughAnd the look of it has grown on me its just one more thing that separates it from most installs and it allows you to better view the excursion that monster has its got an Xmax of mm. ,CarAV,cqsla1r,1,t5_2t73y

4064133,0,t3_37463p,Increasing resistance would only be beneficial if you didnt try and adjust gain to compensate. Honesty increasing resistance would probably have a negative effect in yor case because youd be forcing your amp to try and do the same amount of work BUT with significantly less power.Increasing resistance will help with heat because it means less power to the amp but increasing the gain means youll just be trying to do the same with less you get me? Best way to avoid that kind of heat is to not push your amp so hard. Make sure your gain is set reasonably with a DMM or better method and if it still concern s you then get an amp with more headroom where its can handle your load with more ease.Perhaps even a dedicate amp rack with more room to dissipate heat would be good. While on the topic of improving check your voltage at the amp to make sure its not dropping to low because if it is your amp will draw more current and work harder to produce rated power resulting in more heat. Technically a power wire upgrade would help if youre not already running AT LEAST awg OFC.,CarAV,crjjgb4,1,t5_2t73y

4080370,0,t3_37c0bs,Well first thing I would say is go back to the sidebar check out the approved gear. Figure out what you want and find what the lowest average price it goes for online. Assume the shop can typically get it lower than that price not true all the time but dont expect to purchase equipment from the for the same price they get it for. In my area or at least my shop they get hour for labor if I am not mistaken. From there tell them the equipment you want and get a quote with labor for the install. Minus the equipment you picked out from the total on the quote and figure out what the labor cost ends up being. Expect from hourwhich I would assume is very low up to hour. If it comes out hour or more I would be a bit concerned. Under that I would say is a fair amount. I would say let the shop know ahead of time you know what the average cost for your equipment is so you dont have to deal with an awkward negotiation. Of course do your research. MAKE SURE you know your equipment details. They may try to pitch the logic of you paying more for the equipment you get from them because they warranty it which to a degree is true but most online retailers offer a decent warranty and the only downside to purchasing online is shipping costshassle in the case of returns which if you get quality gear will be a rarity. And last but CERTAINLY not least...REVIEWS REVIEWS REVIEWS. While you should always take reviews with a grain of salt they can be the most helpful when it comes to knowing the quality of a shop. While its pretty rare to find a shop that often scams people and still be in business the quickest way to find out is the reviews and always be mindful of the date of the reviews.Of course I could be completely wrong about all of this as I am not a pro but this has been my experience in the past  years with multiple installs done by a few different shops.

The radio should have come with a mic however check the packaging as it is a bluetooth capable radio. Those metal connectors are there for ease of installation though if youre soldering you can just cut them off. Crazy enough the brown wire is actually from way back when car phones were just car phones and when you received a call it would mute the radio haha. If you dont have a car phone youre ok there. Blue white wire is also for sending a remote turn on signal to something like an amp so not necessary without an accessory you need to turn on with the radio. The blue wire is for a power antenna again if you dont have one no need. Id suggest using the c clip and finding a screw or piece of metal to screw into its a much better ground.Disconnect the battery before you start and solder the two harnesses together on a bench use zipties or tape to keep the wire bundles neat and of course heat shrink your solder.

I dont know what you have for a alternator but a quick google search is telling me that your motor uses a  amp standard.

Ported are more efficient more sound per watt but larger.If youre running sealed and getting cone slap then you need better speakers. Running less bass use a highpass filter at like Hz or Hz might be a reasonable workaround.If youve got holes in the box then that is going to be an issue. ohm speakers can never be wired to be  ohms unless you use a multiple of  of them and thatd be per channel if you wanted  ohm loads.NAD is a good brand but that was not a good choice of equipment. Anything batterypowered should use a newer Class D amp which is  more efficient. Uses less input power for the same output power. Weighs less. The couple of NAD receivers I had a T and a T also ran quite hot. Honestly an inexpensive T amp Class T Tripaths trademark for their own flavor of Class D like a Lepai for around  would be adequate more efficient smaller and lighter.,CarAV,cv3ozjg,1,t5_2t73y

5143881,0,t1_cv604s2,Reference series RS is the common one but it is difficult to fit into most car doors without some modification. Ive used them. They do sound very nice though. About  deep which is also usually going to prevent them from dropping in easily. Sometimes a spacer speaker ring can add enough depth but you may hit the door panel.I actually ran the RSs in one of my cars for a while and again they sounded nice but they were difficult for me to fit in a thgen Camaro even with speaker rings. Came down to me needing to modify my door panels to keep them so I gave up. I ran without door panels for like  months for them... hahaRS is also pretty good but is going to be a bit smaller than most .s and may also not drop right in. . depth a bit easier.A note about the metal cone drivers like the RS  they are very picky about crossover frequencies and slope because metal cones ring like a bell at higher frequencies at a  driver generally the problems start around .kHz depending on the driver. With the RS you should cross them between  and Hz which requires a tweeter that can do that such as the Seas Neo. Most tweeters will either blow with a crossover that low or just sound bad due to high harmonic distortion. If I remember correctly I crossed mine to my Seas Neos at about Hz thorder dBoctave.Ideally you want your drivers to have a nice clean response at least  octave beyond your crossover frequencies and  octaves is actually preferred. Otherwise youll want to use some additional filtering beyond just the actual crossover filters. Like notch filters and the like.Similarly to those you can consider the GR Research MX and MX which have XBL. They are around ea. Paper cones. Higher Xmax than the Daytons just slightly. Will be easier to integrate. No high frequency ringing from the cone. I would actually recommend these over the Daytons for most people.,CarAV,cv613pg,2,t5_2t73y

The AMFM issue is likely unrelated. Additionally the AMFM antenna is controlled by the headunit. Its  years old and likely broken.

5653379,0,t1_cwx74xj,For a solid comfortable reliable car the Accord is hard to beat. Luxury cars are often the same car under the skin or at least second cousins. But sometimes not.Acura and Lexus just have more bells and whistles than Honda  Toyota.  Little more power little more sound insulation few more toys a bit more weight a bit more fuel consumption. Luxury cars tend to get the new technology first. This means that you may be the guinea pig. It might work it might be a maintenance nightmare. The Japanese tend to be pretty solid however. They know that their customer expects quality. The domestic and european luxury market however....Youll pay a premium get a quieter smoother ride. Mostly at that point you are just playing the look at me Im rich game.  The dealer will charge a lot you more for repairs and suck your dick a little more with fancy customer service. Parts are of course more expensive and there are many more toys to break. Luxury cars tend to not age as well in the long run and there is no greater shame or expense than driving an aging luxury car.Youll attract attention from all sorts of the wrong kind of women too. The gold digger crowd. I used to work for Honda Acura and a few high end independent shops that did high level troubleshooting. I often drove high end cars for a few days trying to duplicate a problem. Roll up in an expensive luxury car and girls do act different. Every single time. The hair twirl the shoulder touch all the little body language thing that let you know they are interested. I began experimenting with different cars and paying attention. After awhile I go really disgusted by the whole game. I just wanted to find a solid non money focused person.But hey who doesnt want to marry money? I wasnt looking for it but in the end I did.. Life is weird.I could easily afford a luxury car. Would I? Fuck no its just not me. We might go for the performance package however. When I build a proper go fast machine its generally a sleeper.

6023044,0,t1_cy73595,Hmm if turning the headlights on makes the sound go off... what if you leave the headlights off and turn on something else like a seat heater rear defroster or something like that? If you could narrow it down to having problems when your alternator is under more load you may need a better alternator though the problem sounds worse than I would expect.By the way... have you done your big  wires in the engine bay?  altgtbat .  engine gt frameunibody of vehicle ground.  battery  to frameunibody ground. Doing this upgrade is pretty important if you have a decent amount of power in your system.It could still be a bad ground as well.Edit Another thing you can do is drive to Autozone or similar and ask them to test your car battery for free. They will also test alternators but youd need to unbolt your alt and borrow a car to bring that down for testing. It could still just barely be good enough to start the car but still be worn.

Subs add some depth to this for people like pink Floyd Styx etc. The more important bit is midbass. This is the prime area for bass guitar lower vocals especially for metal drums that kind of thing. It is impossible unfortunately to get a level response from hz on a single driver. You need a sub for the low lows and a Midwood er for the kick drums bass guitar. Both of these require amps.

And component speakers arent too much harder to wire just take a bit more time. how much time mainly depends in where the tweeter is. Personally if I was going to replace them and I already had components thats what Id stick with since they give better sound staging. My tip is since you know you are going to run and amp later run good  or  gauge speaker wire to both speakers.

You wont always do this but it is actually very easy for this to happen. Dont risk it. If you roll the window down first its much harder to shatter it  you would need to REALLY mess up like trying to screw the speaker into the door even when you cant get it to fully seat because it hits the window.If its the drivers door or if you have manual windows youd also have to disconnect the controls to put the window down in order to remove the door panel making it a pain in the ass.Id say his advice on this is pretty important.,CarAV,d1kx19u,1,t5_2t73y

7336991,0,t1_d2blgl4,Dont feel alone Joe the mono amp with the two speaker binding posts confuses many others as well.  Whats the purpose?  I can only guess but Id say if you were to have two woofers in two separate boxes than you would be able to run each speaker to its own binding post and than the amp will internally tie the two in parallel configuration.  Another thing Ive seen is people hooking one voice coil to one speaker slot and the other voice coil to the other speaker slot.  Yes it will work but I dont recommend it.   I would use at least a  gauge speaker wire to combine the voice coils on the woofer and also the run from the box to the amp.  Depending on how long the run is between the boxs and amp you would be okay with the  gauge but its better to err on the side of too much than not big enough.  ,CarAV,d2c5yvb,1,t5_2t73y

In your case youre correct in the wiring of the mute cord although the Orange and white cord youre hooking up to illumination I think may need to be hooked up to the dimmer.

7785302,0,t3_4lxz1h,this vehicle takes a . inch speaker in the front and a  inch in the rear. depending on which speakers you go with you may need to purchase speaker brackets to make them fit better. no air gaps around speaker. other than that if you are looking to amplify your door speakers AND add subwoofers you will need a  channel hilo adapter to connect to back of factory stereo. changes speaker wire outputs to more commonly used RCA connectors that all amplifiers take. ch hi lo adapter about  to . after that id just pick a good set of . for the front. perhaps visit some local shops with a few tracks of the music you like. with an aux cord you should be able to connect your phone to their displays and while listening to the same song switch from speaker to speaker to hear which one sounds best to YOU. some speakers are better than others but everyone has slightly different hearing due to things they may have experienced through life. someone who blasts their headphones constantly may have slight losses in hearing at certain frequencies. others that work in noisy environments may have lost different frequencies as well. so pick what sounds good to YOU. it may not be the  jl audio components or the  alpines. i thing for  you should be happy with most speakers. once your front stage is chosen that is technically the hard part. now have your trunk measured. look at your trunk and honestly decide how much space you are willing to part with for subwoofer. keep in mind your spare may be under a panel and fighting with this huge subwoofer box on the side of the road in the rain at night to replace a flat tire will quickly rise to the top of the crap you dont want to ever do again list. once you figure out how much space you are willing to part with then just measure that area. length width and height. multiply those numbers and then divide by . that will give you your airspace in cubic feet. which is how you determine which subs are going to work best for you. for example lets say you have  inches across and you can go  inches high and you have a total of  inches deep but you dont want to use all of it so you go with making the box  inches deep just so you can carry stuff back there from time to time. XX  . now divide  by  and that gives us ..  which is huge. keep in mind most  inch subwoofers take just . cubic ft. s take about . to . fifteens can vary from . to  by themselves. with that example you have plenty of air for s but could do quite well with s too in a ported box. once you determine what subs will work best for you THEN you can figure out what amp will work out based on what those subs will handle. most people will just get a sub amp and run that to their subs and replace the door speakers and be done. but alot of bass and your new door speakers still running off radio power may have the bass overwhelming the highs and you may only hear bass. if you wish to have a more balanced sound get a nice  channel amp and power the front speakers with the two front channels of that amp the rear two channels can be bridged to power the subs and that will give you amplified mids and highs. great sound overall. cheers.,CarAV,d3r4gmi,4,t5_2t73y

8557615,0,t3_4wzp2o,So a couple things could be happening and here is why.First A cheap bus fuse on the main power wire next to your battery terminal can burn inside one of the capped ends of the fuse where you cant inspect it. The fuse might look good in the middle but be bad inside one of the capped ends. As an installer Ive seen this several times. The place inside the capped end can randomly burn shutting them amp off and then reweld itself inside the cap when it arcs from a power surge.Next time the amp looses power run a test light or multimeter between the main positive and negative terminal at the amplifier. If it shows no power then you more than likely have a problem with the fuse fuse housing or terminal at the battery but more than likely its just the fuse. If your positive your ground is adequate.Second If the power shows good at the main positive and negative terminal of the amplifier then test the remote wire by running a multimeter or test light between the ground and remote terminal of the amplifier while the car and stereo is on.If you show power at the remote terminal and you already confirmed power on the main positive terminal then you have an amplifier with issues on its way out.If you show now power on the remote wire then inspect the remote wire connection at the amp and on the other side. If you see no issues with the connections on either side of the remote wire replace it. Its common that remote wires develop breaks due to them being so small and sometimes theyre pinched too hard under the cars interior moldings and trim. If the problem ever repeats itself then whatever your powering the remote wire with fuse panel or radio remote is having issues.The following should help you to locate the problem. Im also taking into account that the wiring between your amplifier and speakers isnt shorting and that the speakers arent wired in a manner that throws a heavier than specified impedance load on your amplifier. Traditionally amplifiers will go into protect mode and shut off the output of the amplifier but will rarely ever turn the amplifier completely off.Good luck!,CarAV,d6ba0di,3,t5_2t73y

8578101,0,t1_d6dsxl1,When adding a  gauge power wire to your amp from the battery its always a good rule to also make sure your ground wire is the same size. Run your power wire and the cut any left over slack and use it for your ground. A good rule is to run some black tape around the end of the ground wire so you never confuse it later if you go to work on your amp. Your remote wire doesnt carry much current so what you have is more than likely adequate if your amp is turning on and off like it is suppose to.For the subwoofer  gauge speaker wire is usually adequate for something like this. Smaller gauge speaker wire can work but you will loose current quickly resulting in less performance. If you want to take it to the next level then bypass the terminal on the box drill an adaquate hole next to it and run  gauge or better directly from the amp to the subs. Is it necessary? No. Will more current make its way to the sub? Yes. Will you be able to tell a difference? Maybe maybe not. ,CarAV,d6duhco,1,t5_2t73y

Competition subwoofer is really a consumer label for a subwoofer built to handle large amounts of power. Generally retailers dont carry competition subwoofers because the people who use them for competition are either sponsored by a manufacturer on a team representing some entity or are independent but very picky with driver selection.,CarAV,d7bp5jt,3,t5_2t73y

9008542,0,t1_d7ulu7i,There is a way to but forgive me but you seem to lack a basic understanding of car radios. For example you said you attached a RCA cable to your cut antenna and then stuck it into a RCA port on the radio the red one. That is a pre out for a sub woofer or a front or rear channel. Not a antenna input. So lets tackle that first. Your new radio uses a standard motorola antenna connector. In a normal situation you would use an adapter like this to turn the factory antenna connector into the standard Motorola connector. With yours gone you have a few options. If the antenna cable is a standard size coaxial you can crimp the Motorola plug directly to it but its not its very thin gauge coax. You could hit a junk yard and cut the factory plug out of another VW and attempt to splice it on to your cut cable so you can use the antenna adaptor. You can follow the antenna wire back into the car and hope theres a junction somewhere that uses the standard Motorola plug so you can install a extension from that. Or you can replace the factory antenna with an aftermarket.As for the main harness you can buy the OEM plug pig tail and attach it to your cut harness so that you can get the correct aftermarket harness Alternatively you can continue down the road your going with a hardwire. You will need to hook up the  corisponding speaker positive and negative. You will need to hook up your  volt constant. You will need to ground the radio. Then because you factory radio turned on with a canbuss signal digital ones and zeros from the cars computer not a standard key switched  volt signal like the aftermarket radio requires you will need to find a switched  volt source in the car to tap into to tell the new radio when to turn on.Being that everything was cut out theres a rather good chance that the  volt constant shorted something out when it was cut. Theres a possibility you have blown fuses or other damage that should also be tested for. ,CarAV,d7uop23,1,t5_2t73y

9134809,0,t3_55eehy,Very cool looking display. Regarding the settings Ive been using a crossover gap in my system with good results and it cant hurt to try. What Im doing is running my sub with a hzrd order low pass and my mains with a hzst order high pass. Alternately a hzst amp hzrd can work esp with smaller mains. The idea is to put the the high pass one octave higher than the low pass and use the gap to help cut out excessive midbass where needed and the values could be adjusted to suit the vehicle. For your vehicle perhaps try  or  or even try a octave gap like  I just thot of this perhaps I need to try. Figure that the output  the midpoint in the gap will be reduced while the deep bass below the low pass will be accentuated. Also the subs phase should probably be reversed so check to see which sub phase settings works best and if you have a variable phase on the amp you can fine tune the subs phase for a perfect match to the mains.,CarAV,d89wj2k,4,t5_2t73y

But stereos and speakers are indifferent to sound quality.  The only thing that can cause damage to your system is overdriving either the power amp the speakers or both.  And theres nothing inherent to any digital audio file that can cause that... only the fool turning the knobs can cause that  either by bad gain staging or cranking the volume to .  YouTube audio and for our intents and purposes all digital audio is a PCM stream... and every PCM stream has the same maximum volume  dBfs.

The memory wire yellow is always at a constant  and its common that people short this one.Check your fuses. Sometimes this wire is also attached to the cigarette lighter if your car has one. If have one test it and see if it works. If its not working then check the lighter fuse.A way to check the power wires is to tie both your red and yellow power wires of your head unit together. Then attach that to the yellow wire coming from the car wiring harness. If the head unit powers up then you know the constant  is good. If not check your lighter fuse location and all others.If the head unit powers up when you follow the directions above then disconnect the two wires yellowred from the cars yellow wire. Dont forget to put a piece of tape over the cars yellow during this step after you disconnect it to keep it from shorting. Next tie them yellowred head unit wires to the red  ignition wire coming from the car and turn the ignition key on and to the accessory position.  If it comes on then you know that one is good. If not replace the radio fuse in your fuse panel. If the head unit still fails to power up after testing both wires and your positive the fuses in the fuse panel are good then . you have a poor ground. . You have a bad head unit or . check to see if there is a fuse located on the backside of the radio itself and replace it. Good luck!,CarAV,d95bqe8,1,t5_2t73y

10475991,0,t3_5q12jz,The noise is alternator whine.  The cause is a ground loop.  This almost isnt debatable.  They broke it.  They fix it.  Obviously the grounds arent all ok.Take it to another shop have them do a diagnosis without taking it all apart. Basically have them listen to it and say Yep thats alternator whine.  Then get a written estimate to diagnose the cause.  Take that estimate back to the dealership and discuss their plan going forward.Honestly just regrounding the head unit from the harness to the chassis will probably fix it.  They moved a lot of stuff around and removed likely all the factory dash harness chassis grounds.  Its likely one or more wasnt put back perfectly.  Its likely they didnt actually do anything to your deck install but rather compromised the grounding of the factory dash harness which your deck is likely grounded to.  Your deck is just showing a symptom of what they did.  Not to say its some huge mistake but its probably their fault.Sending it to an audio shop didnt fix it because the deck is installed correctly be it grounded to the harness or the chassis directly.  They likely werent going to verify the quality of every ground for the factory harness and thats likely where your problem lies.  I assume they did the look for free and just backed up their friendly dealer assuming this wasnt done inhouse by  a guy that knows how to install systems.Having a separate unrelated shop do a quick listen to verify alternator whine and give an estimate to verify and address that is just to get a expert opinion on what the noise is and its likely cause alternator whine caused by a ground loop caused by a insufficient radio ground caused by a improper harness ground just verifies that obviously there must be something wrong and what it is to show correlation.  From there its up to the dealer to do the right thing.There is an outside chance it something else rather than alty whine and thats why a second opinion is important.  They will almost certainly diagnose it as alty whine but it could not be since I obviously cant hear it myself.,CarAV,dcvk901,3,t5_2t73y
