Minister of Armaments of article  Albert Speer sfw gtOn February   Minister of Armaments Fritz Todt died in a plane crash shortly after taking off from Hitlers eastern headquarters at Rastenburg Speer who had arrived in Rastenburg the previous evening had accepted Todts offer to fly with him to Berlin but had canceled some hours before takeoff Speer stated in his memoirs that the cancellation was because of exhaustion from travel and a latenight meeting with Hitler. Later that day Hitler appointed Speer as Todts successor to all of his posts. In Inside the Third Reich Speer recounts his meeting with Hitler and his reluctance to take ministerial office only doing so because Hitler commanded it. Speer also states that Hermann Gring raced to Hitlers headquarters on hearing of Todts death hoping to claim Todts powers. Hitler instead presented Gring with the fait accompli of Speers appointment. gtInteresting Albert Speer Jr. | Inside the Third Reich film | Aryan Games | Albert Friedrich Speer Parent commenter can toggle NSFWmessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcofo oror deletemessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot DeletionampmessageBdeletecofo.

HERE  and HERE  are pictures of the aircraft before it was captured. Interestingly it was first serving with the th.
