50144,0,t1_cek4n1u,thatll give it less butt clearance. meaning you wont be able to tuck it up as high when you hop why people ride such low seats. it also looks really small. you want a bike with at least a in cm top tube. this bike also has a  head tube where the bars and fork connect to the frame which isnt as reliable. in all honesty youd probably have a great time on this thingespecially if you dont have a bike right now. and if you can pick it up real quickcheap then go for it. but if you have time wait for something better to come along. i think the chrome one was a little nicer.,bmx,cek50q5,1,t5_2qjv9

The biggest part of getting it down will be working the momentum and getting them clean enough to climb up shit without twisting the front wheel and falling off.

Since it was warm there and the only people there were the crew of friends I came with we ended up riding outside in the other areas which are usually closed off when camp ends. As we werent allowed to ride anything with someone from the staff supervising the staff went to the owner. Dude was super chill and said since we were all riding the brand new snake run he just told the staff to watch us to make sure none of us got hurt. Was super cool of him to allow us to ride it even though we werent supposed to. And it was our last day there so it worked out nice.,bmx,cg1mcs4,1,t5_2qjv9

757567,0,t3_22tr9n,I havent seen too many actual beginner worthy comments so let me give you a bit of a rundown. First if you are ordering online I highly recommend ordering off of Danscomp or Albes bmx. Two very trusted sites. That being said into the bikes.You want something strong so you dont have to constantly replace parts something a comfortable size and most of all something that suits your personality.Size wise I too am  at about lbs. I currently ride a  top tube giving me a bit more room between the bars and my knees. I love riding crazy wide bars because i mainly ride dirt but if you plan on riding street specific you might want a ..tt. A smaller tt will make the bike easier to maneuver while a longer gives you more space from the bars. Most people dont feel a difference but after riding for a long time then switching frames you will. Into actual companys Kink bikes have been known for solid strength. They can be a bit heavy but if you really get into the sport modifying your bike will not be a problem. They are usually plain colors which is not a problem for me. As said below sunday is a good choice too. They are strong but generally on the pricey side. Most are quite flashy As demonstrated by Aaron Ross so if you dont mind spending a bit more cash and getting more attention go for it. Haroill get hate somewhere for this i know also supplys strong completes. They have been in the sport since it started so if anybody knows how to make something last its them. My first bike was a Mirraco. Was about  at my local bike shop. Frame and forks lasted me forever. I upgraded everything else for my own fun but the stock parts would have lasted fine. The only problem i had was the stock back wheel was quite weak. While learning s i actually bent the rim quite badly. I have never ridden a cult but from what my friends told me some of the cheaper completes components arent the best. He said the frame was awesome but the rims and cranks seem kind of cheaply made. In all reality there is a downside somewhere down the road on all completes. That being said some bikes last longer than others.TlDR Get a . top tube and a bike that carrys a bit of weight because it will generally be stronger.,bmx,cgqe4m6,3,t5_2qjv9

929142,0,t3_24qth7,You are probably pulling straight up as in perpendicular to the surface of the earth. If you want to jump just yourself off the earth thats the way to do it. If you want to yank a bike with you and the handles are at the front then you want lean forward to pull up and forward as you jump. The center of gravity of the bike is somewhere in the diamond of the frame close to the seat tube. Your direction of jump and yank of the handlebars needs to be away from that CoG.Get your weight more over the handlebars and try to jump forward and up.Another way to figure out what is going on is stand in front of the bike facing the handlebars. Hold the handlebars push the bike gently away and then yank it off the ground. Experiment with what works to get the back wheel off the ground from that position. The pull direction needed mirrors the jump you need.,bmx,ch9wc7r,3,t5_2qjv9

1226488,0,t3_2849l5,If the nuts that are holding the bearings in are tight and the axle still spins smoothly then yes its the pawls or springs. Doing whips and the tire hitting the ground diagonally can easily break the pawlssprings and kicking it back into place will easily break them as well. I suggest getting rid of the half link in the full link chain as well as I suggest him taking better care of his bike. However if the back rim is a stock back rim then there really is no way of avoiding the pawls and springs problem. They easily break on stock complete bikes.  ,bmx,ci7ljeo,2,t5_2qjv9

If you wanna do whips just get a gyro but there is also the fact that despite being almost negligible they do add weight to your bike.

Ive sent a message in to buy the bike. I highly doubt the bike is a fake as it looks really legit other than that the bike I listed has  brakes but all photos online only have  brake.    How can I easily check for breakscracksdamage?  In the photo do the  brakes for the rewire look out of allignment?

It really depends on how fast you can throw them to determine the air time you need.To properly throw a barspin you should be throwing them as you level out of your bunnyhop as in throwing them as your back end goes up to be level with your front wheel.  Just watch a bunch of videos of people throwing them.Even easier way is to just try them flying out of a ramp.  Good luck.,bmx,d75k868,2,t5_2qjv9

I would think you would want to spend at least  on a decent bike that will last. You can spend a lot more than that but for someone just starting out you dont need anything expensive. I still think your best bet will be buying locally. Once you get an idea of what you want you could try a local shop. Maybe head to the local skate park and find one of the kids that might speak English and they can help you out?RideBMX and VitalBMX are some good websites that might help you get a feel for what you are looking for.I dont know where exactly you are located but here is an article with a bunch of bike shops in Japan,bmx,db8mclh,2,t5_2qjv9

The next most important factor is finding sealedcartridge bearings in the wheel hubs. Loose ball bearings are an economy part and seriously hamper how well you roll when compared to cartridges. The truth is most brands have cheap bikes and they also have good bikes but you get what you pay for. Hence the benefits of buying used for your first time.,bmx,dc4lv79,1,t5_2qjv9

10272207,0,t3_5mua0m,I went from a MTB to a BMX and the main reason i switched it because I started using the MTB less on trails and more like a BMX.  I learned bunny hops really well had somewhat of a grasp on wheelies and just a touch on manuals.  I think this helped a TON with transferring to BMX and I picked up bunny hops pretty easily.  Once you get used to not having suspension and having a shorter wheel base all of the skills transfer over.  I would save s for the BMX as most MTB wheels are not designed for that kind of abuse.,bmx,dc8esvr,1,t5_2qjv9

11294060,0,t3_616isp,You should do what you enjoy. If you dont enjoy it dont do it. If you do want to continue you should look up how to videos. Learn why you cant do it and fix it. If its taken you this long it sounds like you arent learning from your mistakes. Maybe try videoing yourself and compare it to how pros bunny hop. You got it bro!,bmx,dfc5yxr,1,t5_2qjv9
11335570,0,t1_dfgmzi6,This might sound dumb but is the rise the distance from the grooved part of the bars to the crossbar? If so Im not sure but I can measure when I get home.

11356668,0,t3_6221se,Just an FYI.  You are trying to  the hard way due to your feet.  Left foot forwards ususlly means spinning clockwise.  But its not to say you cant do it that way or that there arent pros that ride that way because there are definitely people that spin that way with their feet the way you have them.With that said you need more air time and to bunnyhop harder.  Work on that and this will get easier.  ,bmx,dfj9a0m,3,t5_2qjv9

11381072,0,t3_62f2ck,On the topic of buying clothes to fit in if it looks like youre trying too hard to get your look right in my opinion youre focusing on the wrong thing and people might take that the wrong way. If anything dont wear anything insanely baggy. I cant tell you how many times ive eating shit growing up because my loose baggy pants got caught in my sprocket and I got stuck in a tabletop because my bars got caught in my shirt. Also Id say keep the phone save  some other way and use the phone to call up your new friends youll make to go out and ride. ,bmx,dfm0x9o,4,t5_2qjv9

11385826,0,t3_62gx6o,Not if you want a legit bmx bike that you can actually do real tricks on. If you just want it for the look or something than hey  why not lol but its garbage and outside of literally just plainly riding it it will not stand up to real box tricks. ,bmx,dfmkbdv,2,t5_2qjv9
11387623,0,t3_62h8ph,Yes it still fits the weekly thread but to answer your question Ive heard nothing but bad things about Mafia Bikes. Its just a rumor but Ive heard that Harry Main doesnt even ride his own frame he just puts the stickers on it so it looks like he is.,bmx,dfmrnr0,1,t5_2qjv9

11502404,0,t3_646kby,A pound of each metal weighs the same what matters is which is stronger. Chromoly is so much stronger than hitensile that you can use thinner tubes of it and get the same characteristics. More for less so to speak.
