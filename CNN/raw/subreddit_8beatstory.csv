My favorite character too Im not too sure about the technical details but I dont think itll be too much hassle to delete and redownload if youre on a decent connection and just want an SRUR for your free pull. The binaries for this game are encrypted dont ask me how I know this though Im not sure if thatll contribute anything to making rerolling any easier or faster,8beatstory,d3wugju,2,t5_3enmh

I think its really just a way to make more people spend a bit of money once in a while you cant keep buying them theres a limit  I think just one of each type actually  and they dont happen a lot but youre right it is very nice.And yeah everyones really cute well actually Anris going for a different approach. I cant wait to see the other cards were getting either.,8beatstory,d9resx4,1,t5_3enmh
