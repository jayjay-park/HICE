1451733,0,t1_ciy8dc6,Thanks for the feedback!Honestly my house is small and a single AP covers it all. Were talking about  sq ft. I currently have a Mikrotik rbghnd which covers me out to my street in the front and to my shed in the backyard.Given that the Pro models are still  Id rather spend the money on an AC unit since most of my future devices will be compatible. Right now I think Ive got about  devices that use wireless. So AP to client load shouldnt be too much of an issue.You ever had to RMA a device?

3218866,0,t1_cov7xki,I dont believe the USG is an exact rebranding of the ERL.Its a different size and looks like a different hardware revision.  Im also going to hazard a guess with its smaller size it does not have a removable USB flash drive like the ERL has.It is not unreasonable that the hardware may be just different enough that an ERL image wont work on the USG. they do not want people getting confused with the type of device they are buying or getting.

Other than that it all depends on what you want to connect.  Need VLAN capability...  a smartswitch of some sort that can handle VLAN tagging would be needed.  Need more PoE ports than the three on the router than a Ubiquiti Toughswitch would do well.  In fact a Toughswitch would cover all your needs.

If you ever move to a dedicated device running DHCP look in to relays.Tbh considering your current setup you might not want to use both interfaces on the Edgerouter at all ie. only use one subnet. You could just set it up through the WANWAN wizard and only use one of the LAN ports. Plug that in to your current switch and not bother with two subnets.

9197395,0,t3_56b77a,gt ELIOK here goes. The internet is a series of tubes A wireless router does two things. It connects wireless tubes to wired tubes so that your wireless devices can get online.. It combines multiple tubes into a single tube so that more than one device can use your home internet.Most people when they buy a wireless router expect their wireless router to do both of those things simultaneously. The Amplifi is this kind of wireless router.It is also possible to buy a wireless access point which is a device that only does one thing. Namely an access point connects wireless tubes to wired tubes but it doesnt combine multiple tubes into a single tube. The Unifi is this kind of access point. If you use Unifi then you also need a separate device or computer or thing to connect multiple tubes into a single tube unless you only have one single computerphonetabletwhatever in your entire house.I use Unifi because I already have a separate computer running a program for combining multiple tubes into one tube and I like having the extra control that comes from separating these two functions into different devices.Theres not much of a price difference between Unifi and Amplifi. The only difference is where the money is invested in the product. For Unifi your money goes towards buying rocksolid wireless connectivity and featureful management tools. For Amplifi your money goes towards ease of use and that really pretty LCD on the base station. Not a criticism  it really is pretty. So its your call. Most normal people would get the Amplifi. But if youre running a business and you have a dedicated IT department youd probably prefer the Unifi.If you want more information heres a good article explaining the difference between Amplifi and Unifi.,Ubiquiti,d8hu5ip,3,t5_2ub3z

It only claims to absorb  joules and never more than  joules.  What happens when confronted by a potentially destructive surge?  In rare cases fire.  Concerned?If it does not absorb a surge then it must block one.  How does its  cm protector part block what three miles of sky cannot?  Did you believe it did something because advertising hearsay sales propaganda also called brainwashing and wild speculation said so?  Or did you demand what must always exist to have knowledge  perspective ie numbers?An adjacent protector can even give a surge even more potentially destructive paths into those appliances.Effective surge protection is based in concepts demonstrated by Franklin in .  All were taught that concept in elementary school science.  Advertising wild speculation etc is about getting the consumer to forget even simplest science.A surge seeks earth ground.  A building is damaged when it makes that connection to earth.  A building is protected when some other nondestructive path connects to earth  ie lightning rod.A surge seeks earth ground.   An appliance is damaged when that electric current is inside making a connection to earth  destructively via that appliance.  An appliance all appliances is protected when a nondestructive path to earth exists at the service entrance  ie a whole house protector. This well proven solution was understood over  years ago.  Why do so many not know this foolishly believe spin myths advertising and wild speculation?Protection of a structure is connecting that current to earth via a lightning rod.  Protection of appliances is connecting that current to earth BEFORE it can enter a building.Previously stated  a Time Warner cable must already have best possible protection  installed for free  and provided without any protector.

9870133,0,t1_datl9w4,You are correct. I only found this out after I bought my current one it was the only one available. None of the ERXs do hardware offloading. The nicest thing about the SFP is it has POE on all  ports. The ERPs are a bit out of my current price range the ERL would be my highest price point. However I will probably never Not any time soon anyways hit a point where the hardware offloading will make a noticeable difference in my network speed which is why I am leaning toward another ERX. edit looks like I am wrong as well with recent updates. ,Ubiquiti,dau3nje,1,t5_2ub3z

10738646,0,t1_ddnkqva,A few things..in regards to your earlier comment.  The second network is fully defined gateway netmask dhcp etc.  If I manually assign a static ip on a client within vlan  the connection shows up on the client tab with the static ip but the first network.  This is likely why theres no connectivity to and from this client. Its network interface is basically configured from a connection perspective.  However if I select the client in the controller and configuregtnetworksgtset static ip I have the option to change the connection from the first network to the vlan  network.  This unfortunately does not change anything.  The connection still shows up in network .,Ubiquiti,ddnlzcr,1,t5_2ub3z

IIRC the default PLEX port is ... but you can set it manually via the PLEX web interface as well.

10824155,0,t3_5uhuem,I dont know how the USG works but this is the EXACT setup I have on my pfsense! I havePersonal LAN  ...XShared LAN printer sonos chromecast  ...XGuest LAN  ...XI also have a captive portal configured in pfsense as I have airbnb guests. This way the codes expires when the guest checks out. No need to keep changing wireless password open. I set up firewall rules to allow personal and shared to communicate and firewall rules for guest and shared lan to communicate. Sonos uses IGMP and chromecast uses mDNS so these services have to be set up and activated. Works flawlessly. Because of the captive portal and guest isolation the chromecast does not work from the guest LAN any longer it works fine if guest isolation is turned off with normal discovery but it works fine in guest mode. Hope this helps!  ,Ubiquiti,ddwfool,2,t5_2ub3z
