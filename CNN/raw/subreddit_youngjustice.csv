227092,0,t1_cf1sfxc,Oh! Nobody else has said that the Team should run around the galaxy. I like that idea. Not sure how you could make it work but I really like it.And yes Dick has served as Batman twice. Once after Bane broke Bruces back and JeanPaul Valley was going nuts Dick agreed to become Batman for a bit to help stop him and prove to Gotham that Batman isnt a psychopath and that JeanPaul Valley was a fake.The second time was after Bruces death stupid retcons he decided to become Batman because he reasoned that Gotham needs one and its better than Jason being Batman. Huh. Just realized that he became Batman twice to stop other people from tarnishing Batmans image. Anywho he remained Batman against Bruces wishes to train Damian as Robin and Bruce accepted it and came up with the stupid idea that there should be a Batman Incorporated. Ugh. And thus came the legion of Batman one in every major country.Anywho Dick in the show doesnt want to be Batman as we see him confessing to Black Canary. So I dont really think he would become Batman even if Bruce wanted him to which he doesnt. I mean he said he is going to take a break for a while and not fight crime. I would like to see him join the Bludhaven police force.,youngjustice,cf4aai0,1,t5_2t3l1

Wiped from the face of the Earth for all time!!  gt Glorious Godfrey  src gtgt Glorious Godfrey  srcgtGlorious Godfrey is one of the New Gods of Apokolips and a member of Darkseids Elite. He is a revelationist and his power is the ability to persuade minds. This is accomplished by charismatic rhetoric that brainwashes his victims. The Justifiers are his personal army and he can teach them to justify any behavior through AntiLife. gtDarkseid sends Godfrey to begin his invasion of Earth. Godfrey uses his persuasion powers to build an army of followers teaching them that AntiLife will protect them. These followers are armed with Apokolips technology and they become Justifiers. His agents are sent to track down and kill the Forever People but they fail in this mission. The Forever People send Infinity Man to defeat Godfrey in his giant tent. Darkseid intervenes to banish the Infinity Man and send the Forever People to a camp run by DeSaad. Godfrey confides in Darkseid that he believes AntiLife exists and can be induced but he thinks the AntiLife Equation is a myth.  Godfrey is later seen again using his army of Justifiers to assault Serifan and the SuperCycle. gtgtMain article LegendsgtGodfrey was integral in Darkseids attempts to deprive Earth of its heroes in which Godfrey assume the identity of G. Gordon Godfrey and hosted a massive smear campaign towards the heroes which proved to be so successful that led to a law of outlawing superhero activities. Once alienating the heroes Godfrey hypnotized his incensed human followers and lead the forces of Apokolips on a charge on Washington D.C. where he is ultimately thwarted by a cadre of assembled heroes in which he lost his credibility over his mindcontrolled followers when he strike down a young girl Lisa Sutton in front of everyone present. Desperately Godfrey put on the Helmet of Fate in a lastditch effort to acquire power with which to save himself but his mind cannot withstand the helmets awesome enchantments and he was reduced to insanity.  Godfrey was then incarcerated to Belle Reve before being broken free and returned to Apokolips. gtThe Ravers later encounter Godfrey during a massive battle on Apokolips during the events of Genesis.  The JLA are warped to a future where Darkseid has taken over the Earth in Rock of Ages and they see Godfrey acting as Darkseids herald.  Granny Goodness is seen using Godfrey as a motivational speaker in her orphanages. gt  Persuasiongt  Charismagt  Although this character was originally introduced during DCs EarthOne era of publication their existence following the events of the  limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths remains intact.

Not that there havent been some great Joker interpretations but everything DC is so saturated with him it almost seems like we need to give him a break.

6864393,0,t3_49k9ns,Jesus H Christ what is it with you and inserting elements into things that arent necessary? Ok so lets begin with the usual. What do any of the characters youre harping on this time have anything to do with the Team. Ill give you Queen Bee Tuppence and Granny Goodness they would work. Maybe Nyssa Al Ghul. But Star Sapphire? Harley Quinn? Poison Ivy? None of them belong anywhere near a Young Justice season that focuses on Apokalips. Star Sapphire is a very personal villain for Hal Jordan its his on again off again girlfriend after all and this isnt Justice League Unlimited where they can just have a few dozen background villains because of how large the League is. Green Lantern has never had a side kick everyone to wear the ring has always stood as their own hero so there is literally no reason to put Star Sapphire up against the team ignoring the fact that of the heroines youve mentioned only one of them would last more than a few minutes against an opponent as powerful as Star Sapphire she would wipe them out. Why do we need to be told that Zatara is still wearing the Doctor Fate helmet? Thats already been covered a few times throughout the series. Why retread old ground.Why do we need to see a flashback to something that has no relevance? MGann has already come to terms with what she did has already accepted that what she did was wrong and has moved on. Theres no reason to see the impetus especially when weve already seen it. She mind wiped Psimon that was what put her down the path of abusing her powers.Why do we need to see a flashback of what caused KF and Artemis to want to go into retirement? That would be completely pointless since one of the characters is dead and the other is trying to move on and what would that have to do with a girl centric episode?Pardon my language but why in the flying fuck should we care about what a pair of D list characters who had all of five lines in the entire series did after Aqualad blew up a Mt. Justice? I get that you want to come up with ideas and I appreciate your passion but you have quite literally zero understanding of narrative. Think your suggestions through. Think of why the characters would appear. If you cant come up with a reason outside of its a gurl ep then they should not appear. If you cant come up with a reason other than the fans like them then they should not appear. If you cant come up with a reason as to why a flashback should happen then it shouldnt happen. ,youngjustice,d0ue0tb,4,t5_2t3l1

6956383,0,t1_d13tjar,As the biggest Superman fan I know Young Justices Superman is crap. Hes insecure emotionally inept reluctant to communicate acts based on faulty assumptions and isnt even that competent in the field.Any Superman worth having around would immediately take to Kon like a big brother as he did in the comics. But see if Young Justice had Superman do that hed make Kon happier throughout season one. Which would potentially be great but YJ is a show about teenage superheroes and teenage drama and Superman being an emotionally inept uncommunicative jerk is essential for Kons teen drama throughout season one and if he was competent in the field hed have made the intro to season two less dramatic as well and just yeah. The way I see it Superman is just a tragic casualty of the shows central concept.At least Superboy improves significantly.

9578138,0,t1_d9toit6,What self harm could speedsters do when messing the SF?Well you can get trapped in it. Most all dc speedsters have been stuck in it at one point or another in the comics when they dont really understand it which we most likely have a case of currentlyAnother way not knowing about the speed force could fuck up your day is if you accidentally time travel or jump dimensions. Theres an episode of batman brave and the bold I think where Barry runs too fast accidentally goes to the future and becomes a running slave to his nemesis zoom.Over use of the speed force when you do know how to manipulate it can be bad insert the flashpoint animated movie andor the current cw season of the flash tv show. When speedsters use the force to play god things really only get worse.EditJust to add on a last bit here I think they could equate having such an awesome power as this to how the writers treated the helmet of fate in S. A force so powerful it can turn the tide in any fight whether theyre facing a team of uber powerful villains or a giant laser wielding planet. Its op but it comes with such a high price that itd be impractical to use it constantly. I guess maybe they could treat it like that. ,youngjustice,d9tp8s6,3,t5_2t3l1
9596312,0,t1_d9vvqcn,Yeah the only things Ive appreciated almost as much as YJ these past few years  have been the animated justice league batmanDamien Wayne movies. War blood son of batman throne teen titans. Flash recently is on the fence for me. Twice now the big bad of the season has been someone who was undercover on their team the whole time. Hopefully as we see more of alchemy we get some new directions going. He seems like a villain who instead of being the main threat pulls strings and makes things happen to cause minor threats. Arrow is on the recovery atm supergirl too. Both in strong standings for the future. Legends is getting intense though.

11310818,0,t3_61csyv,Ok I watched the episode heres an update.To be frank I have no idea. Ive never noticed any usage of symbolism or metaphor before so it seems a little out of place in this episode. But I got a bunch of theories.Ive only noticed clocks in this episode twice once in the beginning where Wilcox is established as a character who is extremely aware of time so much so that his character design has a clock on the person. From the young justice wikia it says Dr Wilcox is based on an actual person so maybe it was a dig at him? A sort of inside joke? Maybe the irl Wilcox is that anal about time.Secondly when STAR labs is about to collapse theres a close up of a broken stopwatch the I assume same one that Wilcox had beforehand. On a close up it is shown that the clock is at exactly . Im going to guess this a foreshadowing as a representation of the Doomsday Clock where The Clock represents the hypothetical global catastrophe as midnight and The Bulletins opinion on how close the world is to a global catastrophe as a number of minutes to midnight. I guess it is to show the point where the reach gets a huge upper hand where they start controlling blue to gain influence in the public and that the reach apocalypse is upon the world. Without the intervention of impulse this would probably be where the good guys start losing. Also it is the episode where we find out Blue is under control so maybe its a foreshadowing for the viewer?,youngjustice,dfe2b3l,7,t5_2t3l1

11739681,0,t1_dgqgq3t,Season  of The Flash was fucking amazing especially with Tom Canavagh playing Wells. Season  of Arrow was also really amazing. The second half of season  of Supergirl was okay.All these shows quickly went to shit after their first seasons. Arrow was on a slow decline with Season  still being pretty good and then S and on falling to shit. But that was okay because we had Flash S. Now that everythings garbage I dunno. Theres no point in watching them anymore.,youngjustice,dgqq12l,7,t5_2t3l1
