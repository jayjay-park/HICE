Team based game modes are based on working as a team to win and team killing goes against the very nature of the game mode and is not okay.  FFA is about doing whatever you can to win.

69190,0,t3_1uvweq,I had a similar experience some weeks ago. I was very high on LSD and smoked a few weed puffs.I like playing like this because shit just get real. I got so immersed into the game that I was genuinely scared of dying I was playing a Elimination Team Deathmatch in the Arena. For that match in particular we were even  rounds won for each team. And suddenly almost every enemy player switched to archers. They raped us. And for the next round we agreed to switch to archers too. As soon as we got out of the barracks into the arena I was running to get some cover and turned back to get sure about how many archers we were. I saw an allied archer being headshot. I immediately got behind a pillar and both teams started to rain death. I killed  archers and in the end we were  vs . My heart was racing and I was sweating profusely. I peeked to spot one of the enemy archers but I died. I came back to reality and remembered it was just a game. But I swear this was INTENSE.For the rest of the session I switched to play some TO. It was awesome intense and fun. But nothing like that match.About your point you are right man I have something like  hours and I barely think about my moves now. Specially when Im drunkhigh. I think that playing when being in an altered consciousness state turns you into some sort of auto pilot mode. What Ive noted is that I rely a LOT more in my intuition rather than what Im actually seeing like when you turn around and parry because you either feel or hear an enemy who wants to catch you flat footed.,ChivalryGame,cemb1h6,2,t5_2vb9k

423276,0,t1_cfomd5p,Warbowbodkin can one shot all classes to the head except for the knight.The light crossbow can one shot all classes to the head except for the knight.The heavy crossbow can one shot all classes to the head.Body shots are entirely too rewarding you can completely gimp someone from a fight from a huge distance just by firing blindly into a group. Dont throw realism around this is game balance. Crossbows shoot laser beams across the map with insane velocity and no projectile drop. So much reward for so little work.The backstab damage bonus is this even a question? Why should you have the ability to one shot all classes from range and have a melee damage bonus? The shortsword and thrusting dagger are so strong. You know that something is wrong when an archer can three shot a knight.This one is one of my favorites switching your weapon to bypass flinch. I walk up and start to combo an archer who for some reason still has his bow out. I hit him once he switches to his secondary and stabs and flinches me in the middle of my combo.One good archer completely ruins the game for the opponents. They need to be balanced. Archers have complete ranged superiority and the ability to three shot the tankiest class in melee in the game.,ChivalryGame,cfomymw,8,t5_2vb9k

442996,0,t3_1z5ebh,Let me educate you and everybody else what the tracers on the flail and the changes to them mean.When you view tracers through the console command you see a blue and a green trail evidently the blue trail is much larger than the green. This is the collision trail. You cannot hurt enemies when this tracer trail goes through them but they are allowed to block or the weapon can get caught on surrounding objects like walls.The Blue section of the tracers on both the flail and heavy flail were ridiculous it would get caught on virtually anything and the tracers would be so wild and ridiculous that you could almost block every type of attack from the flail by simply looking straight ahead and clicking.The green tracers were so small that you needed to be right in the face of an enemy to hit them effectively sure the animations were unpredictable? but they could still block it by looking in the wrong direction or by parrying at a random time due to the poor design of the blue tracers.Now the changes have tidied the blue trails which means that the weapon is actually HARDER to block. Thats right its harder to block. Because there is less blue tracer for the weapon to get caught on and you have to be more specific about the direction you are looking in to block it.If you were having luck with the flail before and now you are not having luck with the flail now it has absolutely nothing to do with the changes in the beta you should reconsider your combat methodology.Feel free to ask and i can show you some of my videos with effective flail combat.,ChivalryGame,cfqojjb,14,t5_2vb9k

Its essentially down to British and panic but even they sorry British dont play often enough to really determine which is better at this point. Its truly up for grabs in my opinion. From what I have seen in game from both they seem to perform the same and are both beatable its not like they are the end all be all  archers that never miss or have  accuracy at all ranges.

Many of us are busy all day and get on Chivalry just like you.  arent pros and still very much enjoy this game because of the tense competition and strive to get better. OF COURSE the few players who do commit their life to the game are going to be better than you. In a competitive multiplayer game the more experienced player is going to win especially on such a skill oriented game like Chivalry. Competitive multiplayer is driven by the skill of the players and trying to get better. Chivalry would lose a lot of its replayability if everyone was on equal skill level and there wouldnt be much of a point to get better.This is not to mention the fact that Chivalry doesnt have the large enough playerbase to split up the servers depending on rank either.,ChivalryGame,cj5996r,2,t5_2vb9k

On another note Ive found that good footwork and baiting for slashes combined with a slowoverheadtofaststab is the best medicine against weapons with long release times. Also always try to make people think they have the upper hand and surprise them when they get cocky.

1648441,0,t1_cjmwocd,they dont have any more HP than any other class just resistance to attacks which every class in the game has resistances. Vanguards have more resistance than maa or archer yet their higher armor than archersmaa is not a special ability. Neither is the knights.The only real special i could think that a knight has is the ability to weild  handed sword and shield. That is the only thing unique to that class no other class can do  handed weapon in  hand with shield.armor is not a special. there have been suggestions to bring back the crouch to regen stamina faster as knight... in which case that WOULD be a knight special ability. But his armor resistance is just class based.Furthermore as others have said you could make an argument that footspeed or reach is a special ability which they are not. Maa and archer are faster than vanguardsknights. Vans are faster than knights. Maa can backpedal faster than any other class.. but their ability is dodging. You could also say that since vanguards have the longest range melee weapons their special is longer reach. Vanguards also have smokepots and maa have firepots but those arent specials either.With the archer though my main feeling is that they shouldnt have the same hit to kill in melee as the full on melee classes... and with backstab they do. Even a knight stabbing with SoW one of the most powerful stabbing swords in the game cannot  shot a vanguard even to the head but an archer javelin can with the backstab bonus. Thats not balanced considering the ranged warfare side.,ChivalryGame,cjmy6rl,1,t5_2vb9k

1736528,0,t3_2ebp6l,Youre pretty much at a disadvantage against MAAs when you have neither range nor speed but you only need to hit them once with an overhead and they are either dead or have hp left if you hit the torso. Feints stabs and drags are your friends against MAAs bait the greedy MAAs to your vicinity and use the long release time and footwork to dodge and retaliate. One unexpected stab is usually enough to make a MAA start panicking and go on the defensive. If they are more defensive than aggressive parry them once and fake a lookdown overhead they will almost always parry early and you can drag the axe into their head. If they dodge a lot keep pressing on them until they run out of stamina. If you miss combo and make them chase you so they have to risk a hit trade. Riposting is usually a bad idea with short weapons unless you have the MAA cornered.I have also noticed that using slashes work well as defensive attacks like backpedaling spear stabs because your opponents cant really sidestep them. Use them if enemies keep trying to facehug you. ,ChivalryGame,cjy1y1i,2,t5_2vb9k

I actively try to better understand these mechanics and bugs hoping Ill adapt or that theyll get fixed.My jimmies will be especially rustled when you try to explain something as if it was  consistent when in fact it is not. Thats my problem with your post. When you say what youve said you put the blame on the individual and his skill when its actually  random. we all know how to parry we learned that in the tutorial. Thats bullshit and you know it.  in a few will be actually inconsistencies and not lack of skill. Youve seen these inconsistencies over and over and taken advantage of them as myself or any other player with  hours in CMW so you should better acknowledge them instead of justifying the unjustifiable. Thats all Im saying. stop playing or adapt. You cant fully adapt when something is broken. At any rate all you can do is relax and I agree with that. But thats just me.

2641060,0,t3_2q5v1i,In team games it might be possible to just focus on the basics and not do any drags matrixing etc. since youll have teammates for backup.  In duels complex drags are used much more than in other game types because its just v.  In the other game modes its a whole new ball game.  I think its sort of become mainstream for people to try to use crazy drags in duels so dueling has sort of isolated itself form the rest of the game in terms of playstyle.  But I think the more you play the more youll want to learn the advanced stuff.  As of now its fine if you just focus on the basics like blocking and footwork because youre still new however youll eventually want to move on the more advanced stuff like dragging matrixing cftp etc.For panic parrying you just have to work at it.  Try to concentrate on the game dont get distracted by chat or something else.  And dont get frusturated or intimidated.As for finding a niche that will just happen naturally.  When I started out I mostly used the greatsword and then the zweihander thinking the knight weapons were too short and the knight too slow.  IIRC I was trying to find the perfect weapon for me to use just as youre doing now and I was watching HEXENs guides to each weapon and I believe I saw some video of a veteran using the longsword and I gravitated towards that.  Now the longsword is my bread and butter.  Im very familiar with it and it feels very natural to use it.  Yeah I do well and I enjoy using broadsword maul dubaxe spear etc. but longsword has become my weapon of choice.,ChivalryGame,cn3bheg,1,t5_2vb9k

With dodge you can have a second chance when you would have been killed as any other class.In teamfights you should prey for weak enemies and be a nuisance in general. MAA is like the rogueclass of Chivalry. Dont play fair. Watch for enemies who are red and take them down. Flank enemies throw in a couple of stabs and run laughing back to your teammates. Team up with a knight maul is the best for this and stabby stab all the time so your opponents are forced to block your stabs while your friends maul hammers them down. Throw firepots at enemies their damage potential is HUGE when used well.Try to take out enemies v. Ff more than one make it a v by keeping them in a line in front of you. Its easy with the dodge. If you face the top dog of enemy team bow to him and run away.. Only to backstab him when he is dueling with someone else hah!MAA is much fun to play but requires a different playstyle than knight or vanguard.,ChivalryGame,co5injn,5,t5_2vb9k

Its useful but its only one tactic and it costs you stamina to use. You need to start using the space you have lead opponents into attacking by missing swings dragging accelerated ripostes etc. Your final fight with Juju the only tactic you employed was feinting and its why it was the only hit he recieved was when one of them succeeded.Also you need to learn your weapons reach. The messer is just long enough to be on par no matter how long your opponents weapon is but it requires lots of footwork timing and knowing exactly how their weapon will land or not land if it be the caseThis is my objective opinion just from watching.,ChivalryGame,cooxohf,2,t5_2vb9k

And you would still be reading feints just punishing them and either taking their health or forcing them to feint to parry and drawing even more stamina than you would get from a kick. Not to mention the fact that you steal back initiative as well.

3751341,0,t1_cqjvbmo,Im rank  but I have thousands of duels under belt and Ive played a lot of duelyard too PTheres a very good reason i suggested fork because of the speed and its nice slow stab. It  shots vanguards and  shots Knights with good hits. However I believe that is simply the tradeoff for less damage. Its very good at making playing make mistakes so the fact that it is weak is offset by how many shots you are able to land. Furthermore fork takes advantage of the speed difference between attacks. The swing is very very fast  and the stab is nice and average. So in many cases not blocking right after a riposte may end for you getting lmbd or mwud  so even high level players panic parry sometimes. If they do  free mwd. But I try not to rely on that exclusively. If more people were comfortable with fighting fork  I would agree with you. However as it stands its the onoy weapon Ive been able to use to compete with players at any level without having to resort to feints. Thanks for your advice though. edit also not saying youre wrong but Ive played all weapons and this is the one I have success with personally ,ChivalryGame,cqjvngi,1,t5_2vb9k
3757333,0,t1_cqjvh6n,Low s is not even that high I never see the best players I know  going  and theyre  ranks higher than these guys.As for feinting them with Sword Of War its actually harder than pp players since you barely stay face to face with tham as theyre constantly running away in all directions and getting in range is hard and when you can get in range youre probably being baited for backswing. And even if you succesfully feint hitting them is not a sure thing because they will run away and target is two times smaller.,ChivalryGame,cqkkaxb,-1,t5_2vb9k

The point is  he did attempt a spinning strike. That was actually the second one he attempted that round.  Point is they actually do spin around wildly. Honestly Im just sick and tired of the bitching about drags like that. With very few exceptions the only people who bitch about them are those who cant figure out how to do them. They dont even strike in a way thats harder to block. Dont panic press the right mouse button and you will block them. Fuck.,ChivalryGame,cqnpdea,2,t5_2vb9k

5477569,0,t1_cwbpkrv,I mean trades do no not occur at the same level as vanilla. The absurdity of the statement is immense seeing as mercs mod literally reduces the possibilities of trades happening in the first place. That is literally the basis of the mod less hittrading on a mechanical level. Eitherway I would simply argue the opposite point mercs makes gambling less effective and penalizes people for merely going for a trade. Backswings are good on mercs and good on vanilla whereas you simply trade more in the Vanilla than mercs and if people gamble backswings adapting to that is not very difficult to begin with. I am always confounded when people say that merc player have a more gambly playstyle  especially when they are vanilla players themselves a game mod where you are rewarded much more consistently for gambling. IT is only in vanilla that you have got an incentive to throw out random attacks into someone and to just go for a lookdown overhead if you got a health advantage. In mercs you cant just do an attack and maybe have a chance to get a hittrade. In mercs you get penalized for doing this. Gambly players do not do as well in it. The fact that you can also read feints instead of relying on prediction or the microness of the opponents feints in a lot more scenarios also makes reading feints a possiblity rather than the throw of the dice it can sometimes be.  I still remember the days when I was in VQ and you and the Clash clan literally quit a scrim mid sluice and demended that we play on vanilla and kept throwing abuse at stouty for over an hour. I am truly glad I left vanilla behind me  and that was one of the first things to persuade me to swap vanilla for mercs trading with Clash and Masterpiece . Of course I was skeptical of the mod at first but by playing it I just felt it to be an improvement. Mercs upon vanilla. I cannot think of a player except for Dusty who has ever thought after playing Mercs mod extensively that Vanilla is the way it is meant to be played. If it were not for mercs I would have quit ages ago and without mercs scrim my exit out of the scene would have been guaranteed.  forgive my spelling and grammer I am way too tired to fix this mess. ,ChivalryGame,cwbt6wm,1,t5_2vb9k

7502504,0,t1_d2upxli,Chivalry wont make your GPU work at full speed because it needs information from the CPU that just isnt available with any processor my guess is youd need a .Ghz Skylake CPU to never drop below . There are some maps that run fine without framedrops at least Outpost Darkforest Hillside Stoneshill and some that have around   framerateframetime variance drops from fps to fps like Citadel and Irilla. This variance is caused by horrible optimisation which for some reason isnt present in all maps. Citadel should be mostly fixed soon as Gremp told me he and a TBS mapper found the cause for the huge performance issue at the nd and rd objective.Your K should be fast enough to push fps most of the time with lowmedium graphics. You should try overclocking the CPU a bit and make sure its actually running full speed. I run the game with a K and a  Ti  I dont think my GPU boosts at all. I can max out BF and rarely drop below  fps at p but Chivalry runs just as wellhorribly on my old K.,ChivalryGame,d2uzugq,1,t5_2vb9k

Statements where mga said they would have the update out by the tourney and were waiting to push the button. I remember we payed the guy who made war mod to do it for us and got shiv to help us do the updates. What happened with that?Some of you are getting paid for thisSee Spook  Draconix Teripper I think and whoever is making the site stillMultiple people have asked for the source code and its come up on Reddit here multiple times. People asked for older ones since new one was obv off limits.Skillz payed for it and I remember the discussions to keep it inhouse and not release it to the community. No open source code. This was awhile ago but why not release it now that youre done with it?Yall have done some cool stuff but this has been very silly,ChivalryGame,da3rmgu,9,t5_2vb9k

10022686,0,t1_dbcilwm,Baron is there a single respected Moorlander that will back you on any of this? I have proof that you told Elder to mute me upon my return thanks to Glassfan one of the few Moorlanders left with integrity. The irony to everything you ranted about can be summed up by your previous comments to my review for this game. You agreed that trolling toxic people who constantly make excuses as to why they lost is a great way to get rid of toxic gamers... The only way I can be considered a troll is if you believe the whole you are what you eat thing. Please stop pretending that youre fair psychologically balanced or even a decent gamer. A spear chucking archer talking about skillfighting is like a Prius driver talking about NASCAR...please. You obviously have a ton of personalmental problems most of which you displayed on my previous Reddit posts...yet you accuse me of having those same issues...please. If you werent so emotionally compromised by anger and stress youd see that my apology to you was legit and out of love. Im sorry for the way I handled a certain situation but Im not apologizing to the ends of what the issue is and why I decided to say something....I fucked the how part up and again Im sorry. I know apologizing to you wont change anything since your true colors reveal someone whose angry immature and holds grudges. You banned me a second time simply for saying well then let me know when you know with a ban message of i guess ill have to think about it. I miss the Baron that cared about the community not his ego. Keep in mind that the best friends youll ever have in life will call you out when youre acting like a cunt. If I had the chance Id manslap the shit out of you...and then give you a big hug.,ChivalryGame,dbdzffh,1,t5_2vb9k
