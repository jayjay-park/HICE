6021755,0,t3_3xuudc,The interesting thing about this rivalry is that there is so much travel between these two cities. Ive lived in SA for about  or  years now and Ive met a shit ton of people from the valley or who have family in the valley or vacation in the valley etc.,RioGrandeValleyFC,cy8z4lh,4,t5_394wc
