2067774,0,t3_2ij3q7,Been a guard in Whiterun for most of my adult life. Love the work protecting the people and yeah the action too. It takes a certain type of person to be able to deal with the scum we encounter and craziness we see. At least thats what they told me it would be like. Truth to be told the majority of my job is walking around waiting for something more interesting than a drunken brawl to take place. My wife doesnt mind the fact that its mostly safe work. Makes her feel like like we have control over how long Ill around for our  kids. So when the Stormcloaks rose up against the true rulers of Skyrim I didnt leave to join the fight. I stayed here while the Jarl twiddled his indecisive thumbs waiting for a real leader to tell him what to do. And thats how it stayed until that Khajiit showed up. One look at his silky black fur piercings and scarred face was enough for me to know he was trouble. Word soon came out that he was dragonborne and that hes become Thane. It didnt matter. Years of upholding the law in Whiterun had given me a sixth sense about people and creatures. He wasnt to be trusted. Months go by with him in and out of the city. Hes draped in new elaborate armor every time I see him. Hes a companion then leader of the companions. He becomes Thane of other parts of Skyrim. He almost single handledly ended the civil war. But hes also an asshole. Goes about shouting for no reason scaring good decent folk. Stands about for hours at a time. Crouches down and almost vanishes before your eyes only to pop up behind you without warning. And thats what we started getting reports about. Seems around the same time hed sneak up on people their belongings would go missing. No one ever saw him take anything but there was little doubt it was him. Nothing we could as he was practically untouchable and we had no hard evidence. Well one day he suddenly stands up before my eyes as if from nowhere. Startles me in front of a bunch of people and other guards. Dick move since the Holds Guards are notorious for never letting embarrassing moments be forgotten. He looks me in the eyes and drops a shield. A guards shield. Where the fuck did he get that? Then a guards sword. Then a guards boots and armor and gloves and helmet. Where did he get all of this shit??? I reach for my sword. Im taking this asshole in. My hands grabs air. I look down and I realize all of the shit he dropped is mine. Im fucking naked except my under cloth and weaponless in the middle of town. Even my goddamn helmet it gone! Why would he do this. I vaguely recall asking him if he fetched beer for the other companions but that was long ago. Surely that isnt why! I could lose my job for this shit. I dont know what to say or do. The prick just keeps staring. I can feel my cheeks glowing bright red. I say Keep your hands to yourself sneak thief! and walk away like leaving my shit there. Fucking hate this guy. Well I guess that pissed him off because I suddenly feel a sharp pain in my arm. I let out a shrill cry. I look down and see a fucking elven arrow sticking out! He had a quiver of elven arrows on his goddamn back! I turn around so mad Im seeing red to look where he was just standing. He had fucking vanished. A couple other guards and myself walk over to where he was. Nothing there. Im naked unarmed and have an arrow in my arm. My commanding officer who had also run over gives me an absolutely enraged look like this is my fault. I have no evidence. Theres no culprit. I let my shit get stolen. He looks at my gear and back at me. Raises his eyebrow as if to ask what the fuck happened. I have no excuse my boss never even saw the guy here and I screamed like a girl when I got shot loud enough that he came running over. Unable to form a coherent thought I mutter Must have been my imagination... like a fucking halfwit as an answer to his questioning and furious stare. His shakes his head in obvious disgust. I begin the long walk home bewildered as to what else I could have done so I can explain to my wife why we have to move to Solitude. I really fucking hate that guy. I hope he outlives his children and ends up as dragon shit.,LifeasanNPC,cl2nrb7,81,t5_2vafm

No other players hopping around no instantly respawning enemies no combat thats just  no godawful training zones no soulless environment no loot drops of  gold no ridiculous quests et cetera.
