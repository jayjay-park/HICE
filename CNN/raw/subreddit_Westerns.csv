10585669,0,t3_5rjque,Some episodes of Wanted Dead or Alive and The Rifleman.  Love both shows. Rio Bravo was on as well. Rio Bravo is probably my favorite Duke flick. ,Westerns,dd7twlx,2,t5_2scev
11696441,0,t3_65ugkb,If I had to pick one favorite director its Ford.  Catch me in a different mood its Hitchcock.A lot of folks will say this is his masterpiece.I see it as one of the most gorgeously photographed films ever.  And in a few weeks I get to visit Monument Valley st time!!!After decades of sincerely trying every year or three I still dont completely enjoy this one.  Weird.Natalie Wood love her work seems a bit miscast.  Its great to see John Wayne stretch and play someone other than John Wayne or  Genghis Khan but the Ethan Edwards character seems so odd and unpleasant to me.  Ill always admire this film Ive just never picked up the knack of really enjoying it.  Arguably psychiatric evaluation and treatment are in order.Can never get enough of Stagecoach  My Darling Clementine  Fort Apache   Godfathers  She Wore a Yellow Ribbon  Rio Grand  The Horse Soldiers  The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance  not to mention a great collection of nonwesterns.Ill grab it on the DVR again sometime later this year or next unless of course I kick the bucket and give er another try.,Westerns,dglt63v,3,t5_2scev
