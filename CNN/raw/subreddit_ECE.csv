168295,0,t3_1vwiu9,This is a very standard requirement but there are an enormous number of solutions depending on. What the tolerance is on the  mA threshold?. Over what temperature range must that tolerance be maintained?. How fast a response is required it could vary from nanoseconds to minutes?. How much voltage drop is allowed for the current sensor?. How much current is flowing in the circuit to be interrupted and is it nidirectional or bidirectional?. How high a voltage needs to be interrupted and is it AC or DC?. How much resistance is allowed for the interrupting switch in the on state?. How much leakage is allowed by the interrupting switch in the off state?. What is the voltage difference between the current sensor and the interurpting switch?  Is galvanic isolation required?. What other power supply voltages are available to operate control circuitry?  In particular is it permissible to interrupt the mostnegative supply conductor?. What other power supply voltages are available to operate the circuitry particularly in the disconnected state?Asking for a current limit circuit is like walking into a hardware store and asking for a screw.  They have hundreds of different screws for different applications.  The  mA number limits that a little bit but thats still like asking for a mm screw without specifying diameter thread type wood sheet metal or machine? head style material finish etc.A very primitive overcurrent shutoff can be found in Q of a  opamps output  When the current through the  ohm resistor reaches  mA the voltage drop will reach .V and Q will turn on stealing base drive and thus turning off the output driver transistor Q.The threshold depends on the transistor Vbe which depends on temperature so this isnt a very accurate cutoff but it is commonly used to protect IC outputs from overload.,ECE,cexlol0,1,t5_2r2sg

Rather you want to use some type of scanning LIDAR to determine where things are in relation to the vehicle. Once you have a d map of around the car you can start to use algorithmic processing to figure out a path. Controlling something as large and expensive as a motor vehicle is not the first step you want to take.

509060,0,t3_1zxszr,Which way the current flows is up to the device plugged in.  The line applies voltage pressure alternately in one direction then the other over and over.  Ordinarily this will cause current flows in those directions in a balanced way when something is connected.But a device could force the current to move against the pressure this happens for instance if you are feeding power into the grid from a solar or wind generator.  Also it could do something weird like only allow current to flow in one direction.  If you put a light bulb in series with a diode and connect it to the line current will only flow the direction the diode allows and the bulb will be fed with about half as much average voltage magnitude as usual.This is an example of a case where the obvious answer that current goes both directions just like voltage does isnt strictly correct once corner cases are considered.,ECE,cfy4sqw,2,t5_2r2sg

Im currently a junior in EE at UIUC so I will try to answer your questions andor direct you to other resources regarding specifically the program here.Like the others mentioned CompE will be a mix of hardware and software. At UIUC CompE and EE are in the same department with similar core curriculum which means that CompE students will have to take some EE courses their first couple years. That being said the CompE curriculum is being overhauled right now so that you would have fewer required EE classes and more options for taking CS courses.You also have the option of switching to CS once you are here. I know of several people in my year who have done this and umilanocookies offers some really good advice on that matter here I would also recommend heading over to Dr. Everitts Neighborhood our studentrun guide to the ECE department. There you can find out more about the CompE curriculum from the perspective of other students.In terms of career outlook both CompE and CS at Illinois are fantastic programs and they draw recruiters from all of the big name companies.

Clearly the system is unstable in open loop you apply a step response to the system and it goes to infinity. Closing the loop is a different thing. Your system is type  because it has one integrator so you only need a proportional gain to get  steady state error when following a step reference. But I recommend you to test things by yourself rather than remembering stuff. Take a K gain get the closedloop transfer function and examine what you get. What is the order and how many things can you change? Clearly you only have one parameter to change K therefore you cant set  and wn independently. There are other choices for controllers of course.

2343535,0,t1_cm1cjrc,Here is a link on homing methodology.   Typically you locate you switch outside your motion range so if we can go from  to mm I would locate my switch at mm for example.  When the system initiates it moves in the direction of the switch at a relatively slow velocity until it finds the switch  it then backs off the switch and then relatches the switch at a very slow speed to get maximum accuracy.  At that point the software says ok Im at mm and then moves to a start position.   At that point the system is homed and you do not let the system move out of the mm range in software soft limits.   Additionally some systems also add a switch at the maximum end and then the switches on either side act as hard limits and stop the system if homing fails.Edit spelling,ECE,cm1dflt,2,t5_2r2sg

Wakeup then involves powering on all of the peripherals reloading them with the saved state and unfreezing userspace which almost cant tell that anything happened.

Then when the NPN is on the output is on and you dont lose much voltage.Your circuit would probably work with a supply voltage of V but at V the N mosfet is maybe losing too much voltage its voltage drop in that config is related to the gate voltage that would be needed to make it conduct and also the input is backwards  when the NPN is off the NMOSFET would be on but operating with significant voltage drop which might actually be nice to spread the heat between the mosfet and regulator but Vgatethreshold isnt leaving much meat for the regulators dropout voltage.  But at least with the NPN on the Nmosfet would be completely turned off.Also unless you are trying to switch the NPN very quickly its okay to not have a pulldown resistor on the base and just use a series resistor from what drives it.  Edit Watch out though in case you have a long wire connected to base  small currents induced in it may be enough to turn on the mosfet!  Working with the gate pullup resistor transistor gain and transistor input resistance you might be able to make this manageable but beware transistor gain is often widely varying between individual parts.Possible enhancement depending on application  A zener diode across mosfet source amp gate to limit gate voltage and a resistor to limit gate pulldown current in one of my projects I manipulated the NPN behavior to limit the pulldown current and save needing that resistor  these together provide protection to the mosfet from supply voltage transients blowing out the gate.Edit if you are wanting multiple power supplies hooked up each with this circuit consider a diode in each output path to prevent one supply from backfeeding another thru the mosfets parasitic diode.,ECE,crrasyz,11,t5_2r2sg

Look these up.Now that everything is transformed build a matrix  entries contain ploynomials of s...which is your symbol.

In short get over the money issue.Still  how happy you are there will have more to do with what you are doing and who you are working with and for  than the money.  Also  as a first job consider how long do you want to be with this company  no offence but you do not know much yet so your value comes from who you are  this may be a learning experience and expect to move on in   years they know it you know it  so the experience may be worth more than expecting the highest pay possible relative to the market.So look at it as a discussion  the key is have as many points as possible.  You are new but they have seen your work and extending an offer based on that is a very good indicator also hopefully you know a little about the company as well what is good what is not.  Bring up issues like who will I be reporting to why is the position open  if someone left  why?  How long has this position been open?   For example  if it is a new position and the person you interned for is trying to hire you  they will fight for you.  Do they have a formal mentoring program  if not a strike against them  if they do and the program is good  LONG term you will have better success so you may actually consider less pay to get a good job with a good mentor.How will your performance be measured  what are the Key Performance Indicators KPIs they use  then if they have KPIs ask how is this incentivized   read bonuses   Does the job require travel of field  customer support.  How are longer than normal hours in these cases handled.   I had a job where expat work had a  Bonus  and onsite we got overtime  that was a nice check!You mention geography  but do not say where your are or will be based is the cost of living higher or lower than the average.The more you make a professional discussion and impression  vs I have a degree what is my pay? the more they will Value  you.

Be paranoid about including dead components that made the first version fail.So VDC supply right?As a first guess Id suspect you got a batch of dead uF caps or perhaps backwardsinstalled electrolytic caps were killed open by reverse polarity.   That lets the bias work fine but no signal path.Usual test  apply your mV signal at R.   Dont bother to attenuate instead overdrive it so you can find the point in the circuit where signal is lost.  Then use a scope switched to AC mode to measure the signal amplitude at the point right after R then after L then at Q base at Q collector Q base Q collector and R.gt I see nothing on the outputSee how?   Oscilloscope right?   Dont use freq analyzer until all the scope measurements make sense.Second guess if not watching the output on a fast scope then the circuit could be madly oscillating gtgtMHz which wipes out any signal but older scopes might not reveal it.  Two stages two signalinversions giving highgain positive feedback from out to in.  So if unshielded wires for inp and out are long or too close it becomes an RF squarewave oscillator.

Indirectly knowing the capabilities without knowing the registers is maybe OK if youve used a library to abstract that away in the past but arduino is so simplified as to not be of much value.If you dont have some familiarity with it you dont actually know the MCU from an engineering perspective. More complex chips may have enough vendor provided libraries and so on that low level hardware understanding is less necessary though configuration still is. This isnt really the case for old AVRs like this as far as I know. Also putting exact part numbers is folly. You can end up with hundreds on a CV with only small differences in each one.

6229783,0,t3_40n05d,I have interned at a number of biginteresting places as well as in the startup scene so let me chip in There is basically a list of characteristics of any engineering job and they actually apply to internships quite a bit as well Technical challenges. How interesting is your work? Team. How are projects managed? How effective is the chain of command? How much authority and ownership are you given and how riskaverse is the company? What is your relationship with your coworkers and your managersother departments? Is your work processdriven or resultsdriven? Pay. Should be selfexplanatory. Worklife balance. This is sometimes overemphasized. Having a worklife balance is useless if you find yourself  years old one day itll happen pretty soon.. dissatisfied with a boring job and an unfulfilling familysocial life. At the same time burnout levels of work with no light at the end of the tunnel poor management and lack of recognition is also a recipe for disaster and can break up families andor friendships. Product. Is the end product something youre proud to be working on? Are you creating yet another widget advancing humanitys future or something in between?Startups have the upside of being small and typically very agile. The growth path is sometimes pretty good for interns assuming youre wellfunded and in a good market. Decisions affecting the companys future can sometimes be made even by interns and you may even get an early financial stake in the company. On the flip side inexperience in managing engineering projects can lead to a lack of direction and your coworkers might not have the time to mentor you.Largeestablished companiesagencies might have better job security and benefits even for interns. You will typically be working with a mentor who will help you get used to the workflow and find resources needed to get your projects done. Pay is usually better and even interns will get some benefits. From a bureaucracy perspective some big companies definitely have more of it than others. There is definitely more process and structure which youll sometimes find frustrating.. but most of it is there for a reason. In some companies interns are given much less of a critical role instead working on side projects deemed too noncritical for fulltimers. In other companies you might actually get to participate on early RampD projects that the existing engineers dont have time for but which will morph into future products and shape the future of the company. Those sorts of internships are really exciting as they have tons of growth opportunities and you might be hired fulltime right out of college!In the end Id say you should stick it out for the summer with the company you are already getting an offer from. Developing your marketable technical skills is crucial for you to have growth opportunities down the road. You can always keep applying to other companies that are in more exciting industries.. whats important now is to get the most out of your existing internships. Reach out to other groups within the company and offer your assistance. Learn as much as you can from the engineers youre working with.. they are usually experienced people with a goldmine of information and skills. You can always do exciting stuff in your own personal projects outside of workschool and turn that around as conversationstarters when applying and interviewing with larger firms.,ECE,cyxrbax,1,t5_2r2sg

I am an Eagle guy from initial experience at my lab but plan on converting them over to Kicad once I get back from my current internship. Eagle is decent from a hobbyist community perspective due to all the tutorials and parts libraries courtesy of Sparkfun but Kicad is fast catching up and all the development by CERN has meant amazing new features like interactive differential pair routing and length tuning which is amazing for highspeed design. Not sure about PIC programming but Atmel AVRs are supported very well by AVRGCC and avrdude in Linux. For ARM processors youll frequently use gccarmembedded and OpenOCD for debug. Xilinx has free versions of ISE and Vivado and they support Linux IIRC. Grab a Digilent dev board and scrounge around eBay for a used Platform USB cable if you start building your own FPGACPLD boards.

6917248,0,t1_d0ywxn4,I really dont know anything about the different teams in MSFT aside from the one I worked in so I cant really offer any insight.I would not say that it takes a technicians role to touch the products.  One of the things I look for in any engineer that Im trying to hire or recommend for a job is that they arent afraid to really dig into the hardware and get their hands dirty in the lab.  The best guys Ive hired or worked with are the ones that are more often in the lab than not and can really back up what theyre talking about circuitwise with measurements or experiments that show they know what theyre talking about.  In the end its really up to you to make your job whatever you want it to be whether that be handson HW stuff coding whatever.  If what you really like is the HW focus more on schematic layout bringup and lab work.  If you want to do SW find a codingdeveloper job.  If you want something thats kind of inbetween look into firmware or lowlevel code development.Ironically the idea that getting your hands on stuff is typically more done by technicians rings fairy true within certain teams at Microsoft  for example the Surface team has dedicated test engineers that do all the validation testing for the design engineers which I found a little sad.  When Id reach out to that team for ideas a lot of the guys there couldnt really speak to how their design worked in detail... and who could blame them?  How can you possibly know how well your design works when you never play around with it or tweak it into doing what you want or need?  It was kind of pathetic and ties into what I was saying earlier about not really caring for the way that HW development was done at that company.  Luckily the hardware guys in the HoloLens team were different and did all of their own testing but I dont think that was a typical thing for HW teams in that company.,ECE,d10e5zx,1,t5_2r2sg

7722278,0,t3_4l2fkw,So everyone else here has talked about software or in general what the protocol is  what it is used for. Thats important however you may also want to look at common hardware implementations. IE. for an IC bus the clk is driven by the master data is open drain. The standard requires a pull up on the data line possible clk too.SPI is pretty but what nets does it use? chip select one per chip clk  or more data lines usually .UART and USB are commonly used for talking to the outside world. How would you design a board with those connections. What isolation would you want to use and or PHYs etc...UART RS is a single data line  ground IIRC but RS has ve and ve where ve is the opposite at all times of ve.USB again uses ve and ve I cant remember how you call that.Disclaimer embedded software designer so only guessing at requirements for EE jobs but I feel EE jobs would ask for this stuff because they want people to build boards with these protocols on ie. you need to know how to connect stuff and what PCB constraints are good practices.Finally as others have said the best way to learn this stuff is to go and do it. Both looking at software and hardware. IC is pretty slow so wire up some chips on a breadboard. SPI is variable speeds so again wire it up and run it slow. USB and UART are a bit harder but you could at least look at schematics and PCBs for other designs.,ECE,d3jyxmx,5,t5_2r2sg

8147826,0,t1_d4vb8bf,I can only really address the first portion of your message here but basically any decent RF design textbook should go over nonideal circuit elements or at least the models for them. As far as what is physically happening Im not sure where to look. Basically it has to do with the physical construction of a device. For example when you have an inductor as frequency goes up it looks more and more like an open circuit up to some point its resonance. At its resonance it looks most like an open circuit and after that it looks capacitive. What starts to happen is that interwinding capacitance becomes significant. Think about the impedance at a high frequency jomegaL means an inductor has a high reactance. At a high frequency jomegaC means a capacitor has a low reactance. The interwinding capacitance of the inductor is in parallel with the inductance so at a certain point the capacitive reactance and the inductive reactance actually become equal and you begin to see a parallel resonance here. past this point higher frequencies even you see the capacitive reactance begin to dominate over the inductive part since they are in parallel lower impedance dominates and voila! you have an inductor looking like a capacitor. Similar case for a capacitor looking inductive except that this forms a series resonance with the capacitors inductance.Just remember EVERY real world conductor has inductance even the electrodes in capacitors and any two conductors have capacitance between them even the individual windings in an inductor which look more like the same conductor at low frequency and more like two conductors at a higher frequency.As far as reference materials go I had a look in my dads collection of books. Theres one in particular I know hes referred to for the nonideal behavior of components RF Circuit Design By Chris Bowick. The first chapter deals with describing nonideal characteristics of various components wire etc. It presents models for nonideal components but does not go much into the physics of why the nonideal effects come into play.,ECE,d4w0x5q,1,t5_2r2sg

8728973,0,t1_d6w5qhe, No. Assembly must be fed through an assembler  and a linker before producing a complete binary executable. The binary executable contains the binary instructions that a processor executes. Its kinda subtle and I think you might be confused about combinational and sequential logic. Combinational logic does not care about clock cycles. It simply propagates logical voltages at the speed of light with propagation delay  Sequential logic involves flip flops that latch logical values on a rising clock edge.Each module in a pipeline has inputs and outputs. Assume the inputs and outputs are stored in registers. The each module must do all of its computation in a single clock cycle using combinational logic. There is no problem here because the input registers will have stable values during the entire cycle giving the module time to propagate its computation to the output registers. On the next rising edge of the clock signal the computation is immediately latched to the output registers and the input registers also latch new values. The new input values do not have time to propagate through the module so there is no problem with messing up the output. This same process happens for each module. You can think of a module as a mathematical function that receives new inputs every clock cycle.Now these modules are placed in a pipeline. Say we have a queue of instructions waiting to be processed. One instruction is loaded at each clock cycle. With each cycle the instructions relevant state moves forward by  module through the pipeline. Thus if our pipeline has  modules it takes  clock cycles to fill the pipeline. Each module is always performing the same function but the inputs change when a new instruction arrives at the module.,ECE,d6wrk6f,2,t5_2r2sg

9526078,0,t3_5b9x3k,A couple of things. Stack sizes are often tiny on MCUs.. A lot of MCU compilers dont have any protection against stack overflows.The nice thing about using a staticallydefined buffer is that  assuming that you ensure you dont overrun said buffer and you dont inadvertently reentrantlycall the function easier to do than it sounds  call a function that uses a static buffer from an interrupt handler that interrupted said function? Whoops! if it compiles it works.My personal preference is to assuming they are supported use them where I would use a fixedsize buffer on the stack instead as check if buffer lt maxsize then alloc it on the stack is never worse than alloc maxsize on the stack.Mind you Ive been wishing for a compiler that actually sanitychecks for potential stack overflows at compile time and inserts checks on operations that could overflow the stack along with spitting out a warning unless explicitly silenced for said function for forever. Especially if it was actually semismart about it e.g. if you call function A that uses B of stack and then call function B that uses lt B it doesnt need to add a check before calling function B. If the compilers really smart it could even compile functions with two entry points  one prologue that checks the stack and drops into the actual function with the compiler emitting calls to check or not check the stack as necessary. But that would be fun to actually do among other things itd have to happen after most optimizations e.g. if a function could be TCOd it may no longer potentially overflow the stack but at the same time it may affect what optimizations could actually be done.

10326385,0,t1_dcegbtd,Sounds about right. Id say that if your modulation bandwidth isnt squarely in the RF ie if you are LF enough that you dont really need controlled impedance routing of the I and Q signals then you should try to slap a pi arrangement of caps one differential two single ended at the I and Q inputs of the chip to round out the transitions a bit and avoid splattering your signal all over the band with harsh keying. Itll also help attenuate the very high frequency differential signals that might arise due to propagation delay differences and other imbalances between the inverted and noninverted baseband. If you are going to be running a high bandwidth baseband probably need to think a little harder about it than just slap on an RC but like others have said you should always have a lowpass filter to achieve soft keying and mitigate splatter. ,ECE,dcejxae,1,t5_2r2sg

People interpret the m length rule somewhat loosely and use Class E PAs of course to get the highest possible efficiency. But of course its really really hard to get reasonable radiation resistance at m at kHz so you are still going to be transmitting microwatts no matter how nice your PA and loading coil.

Also since there is an initial condition on the capacitor the equivalent circuit in the sdomain would include a voltage source of s V and Vout would include this source. In the sdomain the impedance of the remaining resistor would be s and for the capacitor would be Cs which in this case is s. Vout could then be found by voltage division.
