I think dmen have really profited in the new cap era as the middletier guys can easily pull in a multiyear myr contract with very little effort.  Guys who are supposed to be above average or better easily get M but teams can get really stuck when these guys under perform the deal.  Edler is a solid guy but I wouldnt call him a  like other teams have.  Could I interest you in a package that includes Schenn the Younger?  Berube has put in a really tight game plan that Brayden isnt really clicking in it and he hasnt really meshed with Lecavalier like it was hoped.

446985,0,t1_cfr2r80,Hodgson and Horvat carried different expectations altogether. Hodgson was an offensive powerhouse in Juniors and was a leading scorer on Canadas world junior team. Horvat is a dominant twoway forward who played all the key roles on a very deep London Knights team as a  year old in his draft year and has displayed the ability to excel in that position. The Canucks would have expected Hodgson to turn into a stable second line center but his offensive hockey sense did not make up for his incompetent defensive abilities. Horvat is not expected to produce on the scoring charts out of the gates. He is expected to bring a stable brand of hockey with excellent twoway play and the ability to play in all situations. Hell we traded Schneider to get him. Id argue that alone means Horvats expectations are miles higher than Hodgsons ever were.,canucks,cfr3fjz,13,t5_2qrs7

464873,0,t1_cft1zf9,anyone could see that the sedins were not going to be top level players soon. that doesnt mean theyre bad. theyre amazing. they have an unparalleled hockey sense and theyre creative and can put up points.but that doesnt change the fact that theyre old. and unless your name is gretzky or lemieux you are not going to be putting up point per game seasons in your later years. it doesnt matter that thats not their style of game. and i would argue thats its the opposite. the sedins made careers of controlling the boards down low and wearing out the opposition until they could make a pass to an open man and set up good chances. they had the stamina to do this in the past and its not surprising that at this age doing this style of play that theyve regressed. maybe it happened sooner than gillis thought but the sedins have zero support out there.couple this with the fact that basically ALL our top players are over or pushing  and the future is not bright. the sedins are still good players but they should not be relied upon for leading the team in points anymore. theyve had their st line time and they did an amazing job of it but its time for a new st line. the problem is theres nobody in the organization that can do that job effectively. well see what the makeup of the team looks like after the trade deadline.,canucks,cft3vpw,3,t5_2qrs7

Everyone assumes you must be a bandwagon jumper from a few years ago if youre a Nucks fan but I was born and raised in Vancouver and moving across the country doesnt change your loyalties.That being said I would love to see Ehlers as a Canuck. He is an electric player and you were spot on with your comparison to Drouin. I like Drouin a lot but theres something to be said about having the skill AND drive like Ehlers does. Drouin shines when he has someone like MacKinnon or Ehlers playing with him but I never saw Ehlers have a piss poor game even with a depleted lineup.,canucks,cgu7pvg,2,t5_2qrs7

1752859,0,t3_2eipp8,I think people would like to say that theyd fill the arena every night but at the WHLAHL level I doubt that would truly happen. Its not for a lack of initial enthusiasm just that people generally want to watch the stars play not so much the future stars. Basically people didnt watch Wrestling to check up on the  Kid they watched it to see who was going to get the Razors Edge next. And yes Im ignoring that event on May   because we all know that match was rigged but I digress...I feel like having our affiliate on the other side of the continent is crappy when we need to call someone up travel timezone shift but better for the development of our prospects because they get to ease into the organization without the harsh Vancouver media scrutiny and rabid fanbase. Sure not all of us are frothing at the mouth but theres certainly a vocal minority that are and can be quite harsh on the squishy feelings of a youngster just trying to make a career of his passion. ,canucks,ck03tmy,2,t5_2qrs7

But in three years say its going to be a very good trade probably for both teams.  If the Ducks win the cup in the next  or  then yay for them the trade worked out.  If Bonino turns out to be a legitimate  point second line centre for the Canucks and Jared McCann shows his ultimate potential then yay for them the trade worked out.,canucks,ckm9al5,1,t5_2qrs7

2459239,0,t1_cmfly9r,I agree with what youre saying about how being around the team learning the system and forming chemistry to be able to step in when needed is important but for me that isnt a role meant for a prospect who you are expecting to groom into a regular  NHL guy who needs to continue developing by playing everyday like Frankie. Hes been called up  different times now and has played a grand total of  games while in the same time missing out on  games in Utica. No matter how you spin it nothing good will come out of having arguably your  Defensive prospect sit out for weeks at a time when he couldshould be playing. If Frankie was actually getting playing time I wouldnt have as much of an issue but as it stands he hasnt played a single game yet and if all the team wanted was a warm body to sit in the pressbox there has to be a better option available.   ,canucks,cmfnwlw,1,t5_2qrs7

The other players he seems to have frequented the ice with include Jordan Schroeder Mason Raymond and Aaron Volpatti. How many of these players were legitimate factors in the NHL during the  season ucanucks?hint none of themThis season hell almost certainly surpass his career high in icetime. Michel Therrien is playing him THROUGHOUT the lineup. His highest icetime linemate this season is Manny Malholtra at . No big deal. Whos second? Max fuckin Pacioretty at . And then Plekanec. And then Desharnais. Weise is actually getting an opportunity in Montreal. He didnt have an opportunity here because Vigneault and Torts played him SOLELY as a fourthline grinder.Now this isnt to say that I think that hed fit the Canucks top six as well as he fits into the Canadiens top six.

The Sedin asked the small group of people who had accumulated to guess which one he was. Apparently everyone guessed Daniel except my uncle who said Henrik. He was right and my uncle asked Hank if he would call my Aunt as a reward which he did!

3628445,0,t3_31x598,Heres my problem with Sbisas contract and I think they are entirely reasonable concerns. He had a shitty year hands down. Hes been at best a rd pairing defenseman. Hes an RFA the Canucks has very little chance of losing him. Ive always been fine with keeping him since he started showing improvements but with a proveit contract to show he can actually be a decent defenseman at the NHL. Thats fair because Tanev had to fucking sign a proveit contract after a year where hes legitimately proved he was an NHL top defenseman and even after all of that and playing the entire season as a legitimate top defenseman hes only going to make .m more than Sbisa despite the fact that theyre both still RFAs.There was no reason whatsoever to give Sbisa more than one year. None at all. The money was always going to be high because of his QO but to not only give him more than his QO which he hasnt at all earned but also years? When you wouldnt even extend that to Tanev is absolutely ridiculous. This contract is a legitimate slap in the face to Tanev and him and his agent should be furious about it. The Canucks cost Tanev money pure and simple. To put him through all those contract hoops after playing so well only to literally hand Sbisa a silver spoon is insulting. The Canucks have always been very good about contracts under Gillis. There was a legitimate culture here of players taking paycuts to stay and management has been careful about not overpaying even in free agency. The entire top D core took a discount to stay including Edler Hamhuis Bieksa and Tanev. Many of the forwards took discounts too in their tenure like the Sedins Burrows Hansen Higgins and even Vrbata to some extent. Overpaying for Dorsett and Sbisa just sets an awful precedent for future signings. It throws away a really good cap culture entirely out the window and for what? A th line forward and a rd pairing defenseman. ,canucks,cq5vch4,33,t5_2qrs7

Its pretty common on this sub to just dismiss people who criticize as bandwagoners and haters but most are fans who want to see the team do better. Youre right its about the thoughtprocess and the reasoning behind the decisionmaking. The problem is there have been several moves made with shoddy decision making behind them. For example Sbisa did not have a good season by a lot of measures. So what is the thoughtprocess behind giving him a raise for three seasons? In the salarycap world it is so important to try to get the best deals. Why not wait and qualify him? The logic behind it was faulty and any justification that was put forward didnt make sense. gt the fans have no idea what theyre talking about.If you believe that why even come on here and post? Why talk to anybody if they dont know what theyre talking about? Just because they have experience doesnt automatically make them so much smarter and knowledgeable.

Thats fine if you can swing it but its a bad strategy to implement ahead of time.gtFor the most part teams that win win because theyve drafted well outside of the top picksThe vast majority of Cupwinning teams drafted well within the top picks.  Drafting well later is a necessary but not sufficient condition for success.gtIts far from a guarantee. teams compete one wins.  Of course its not a guarantee.  But getting elite talent which is extremely hard to do without drafting high is mandatory if you want to win the Cup.gtFirst of all the logistics of shipping out the Sedins is next to impossible. Yup.  They will retire Canucks and Im happy about that.  But theyll never lift the Cup.  That time has passed.gtThere are very few examples of teams if any that completely throw in the towel while their franchises alltime leaders are still on the payroll and still productive.There are countless examples of teams that ship their stars off at the deadline then go on to win cups  years later.  There are also many examples of teams that delude themselves into thinking their window is still open and dont get value for their players while they can.The Canucks as currently constituted are not contenders.  We are not one or two pieces away from being contenders.  We are not going to win a cup with the Sedins.

4480438,0,t1_cstind7,Not really. The Canucks had Johan Hedberg as the other goalie back in that  series against the Flames. Cloutier as usual got an injury at the best possible time and Marc Crawford thought it would be a grand idea to start Alex Auld he of  NHL games experience in the playoffs. Keep in mind that Hedberg was a fairly good goalie  he carried the Penguins into the Eastern Conference Final against Kolzig and Hasek and was traded to the Canucks for a nd rounder. He also made one of the nicest saves of the year that season in a I think Washington road game. Hedberg carried the team when Cloutier went down with an injury during the season surprise. But Crawford wanted to put a  rookie in net and look where that got us. Moose also went on to take over for an injured Pavelec when he was with the Thrashers and took over for an injured Brodeur when he was in Jersey. The guy was a good goalie was traded for a fairly substantial asset although Burkie loved tossing around nd rounders like they were nothing and was never really utilized.

Look at Chicago theyre super skilled but theyve tried to acquire size as well with the Hayes brothers Saad Mcneill and Beach. LAs won with size but theyve drafted skill too in Pearson and Toffoli. I guess a worded it wrong in saying that style has nothing to do with success I meant that drafting the best talent is the best way to go not trying to draft guys that fit the system. And I think people are misunderstanding the quote. I dont think Benning is trying to say that we should let the other team dictate the style of play just that he wants guys who can be effective in rough and tough games but still be able to keep up against fast high skilled teams. ,canucks,ctuatws,2,t5_2qrs7

Nhl chl world juniors you name it. I was a subscriber for a short time and its a good service but being a cordcutter myself I use gaming consoles for all my tv and I couldnt get on board with watching it on my computer. Some of the plusses for it are that it costs  bucks and you get all the games. Gamecenter is the nhl only product and you can get it as an app on your phone or on pretty much any gaming console. It costs alot more however there are ways around that. Also you will need an isp blocker to avoid regional blackouts.

Plus with McCann and Virtanen in the lineup it gives us legitimate offensive threats for our nd unit powerplay.... which last year was a pile of garbage.Further to that the narrative of oh theyll only get th line minutes in the NHL in the junior theyll get st line etc... We all know the way that Willie  Desjardins runs his lines. Keeping McCann and Virtanen up you could have a rookie with veteran presence on all  lines getting fairly equal ice time. ,canucks,cvicwzz,7,t5_2qrs7

Ended up playing for San Joses farm team last year and was able to climb thier ladder to the top pairing and I think he actually was the top point producing d man or was up there. Sorry Id look it up but on mobile and technically working lol I think Biega Hutton and  Pedan are above him in the depth chart but he has every opportunity to be a top  in Utica and put himself in a position to possibly be an injury call up. ,canucks,cviovtp,1,t5_2qrs7

5378186,0,t1_cvz3uxm,Although I can understand your frustration I dont think WD made a wrong decision and I think his decision was forced by the flow of the game.Firstly it was only Baertschi and Virtanen that received low minutes  mins of ice time for each of them.  Hutton played  mins which is only behind Tanev and Edler for D while Horvat played  mins which is only behind Hank and Sutter for C.Now I do not have a period by period breakdown of icetime but based on what I saw during the game Baertschi and Virtanen got most of their minutes during the first  period I would guess they played  out of their  mins during the first  period.  This is pretty consistent with WDs tendency to play all  lines.  Playing  out of the first  mins is only  mins less than  out of the first  if WD rolled all  lines equally.Furthermore Baertschi got  of powerplay time and was essentially on the nd powerplay unit all game.  Virtanen has the unfortunate situation of being behind Burrows and Vrbata on the depth chart so he was unable to get any powerplay time.  Also I would like to see the number of times Baertschi and Virtanen was on the ice for an offensive zone faceoff as I thought WD sheltered both of them and rarely played them for defensive faceoffs but gave them quite a few offensive zone chances.  Or at least I only noticed them when they were on the ice for offensive zone starts.So with all that in mind it is reasonable that Baertschi and Virtanen did not play much in the rd period.  The Canucks took  straight penalties in a row during the rd period.  Baertschi and Virtanen are not penalty killers and putting them out there would be simply feeding them to the wolf.  The Kings gained momentum after those  PPs and and was constantly attacking and pressuring.  Again Baertschi and Virtanen are not defensive players and playing them under the circumstances would be exposing their weakness.  It could hurt their confidence if they just get on the ice to get hemmed into their own zone and then scored on.  Even Vrbata did not play that much during the rd period or at least I did not notice him on the ice that often because of the way the game was going.Lastly our th line was playing really well as they grinded and battled hard.  Prust and Dorsett both did a good job too when they were called on to penalty kill.  They earned the extra icetime and I think it was right for WD to reward them for their good play.    ,canucks,cvz4gra,11,t5_2qrs7

You often see lots of fights in the beginning of the year because these guys are trying to establish themselves on the team and demonstrate that they are willing to throw down at a moments notice. Thats why half the fights are just staged and out of nowhere cause the bruiser on each team equally wants to impress their own coachteamfans. He had a good game otherwise.

So what if Burr taunted his brother if he even did? Tasteless and in poor form? Absolutely. But nothing other players havent done either. Tootoo himself is no saint he wants to talk about a code maybe he should rethink his own verbal and physical game. Besides him coming out in such a vague manner makes me think this is all bullshit. Why not stand behind your statement if it really is as vile as you say they are? Hopefully it all gets figured out.

5895032,0,t1_cxsbxv3,I agree that Willie hasnt really impressed me this year. I think hes been pretty stubborn about things ie the rookies playing Markstrom etc... and his decisions to play the fourth line as much as he did especially earlier in the season was a little odd. That being said I dont think we can really blame him too much for the lack of development with the young guys. Sure he didnt play them much at the beginning of the season but hes giving them more responsibility now I dont think hes really hampering their development all that much. As for Bo hes had to shoulder a lot more responsibility especially with Sutter out and its hard for him. Besides it seems like every rookie goes through a bit of a sophomore slump. Tldr Willie has some issues but we cant really blame him for everything. ,canucks,cxsdfkj,5,t5_2qrs7

With Jakes style of play his size speed strength and shot...I dont see how he will not be an impactful player for this team in the future.  Maybe he doesnt put up the points of a Nylander but the guy is not going to be an invisible player out there.Here is an interesting article by Scott Cullen of TSN.  He did analysis on draft positions and what player you should expect.  Basically the  pick on average turns out to be an NHL regular.  On his scale the average  is a ...a rating of  means top  fwd and  means top  fwd.  Based on this I dont see anyway Virtanen will be a bust considering he should at worst turn out to be a hard hitting rd liner which is above the average expectation of a  pick.Keep in mind Im not saying you are wrong that we should have drafted Nylander instead.  Will be many years before we know for sure...Just pointing out that Jake will likely end up being a little better than average when compared historically to  overall picks.,canucks,cyhl9e7,13,t5_2qrs7

6216792,0,t1_cyw5eb3,By  I am referring to his playing ability aka conditioning and health.  I might not have been clear about that and I realize that might have been confusing.  Although I have never assumed that Prust doesnt want to be here I can think of some reasons.  The primary reason would be family as his fiancee is working and rooted in Montreal and he is an older player  years old so starting a familyhaving kids might be a bigger factor than just playing hockey.  Another reason would be the fact that he was traded from a Stanley cup contender to a bubble playoff team.  Again these are all just potential reasons for why Prust might not want to be here.  I have not read or heard anything to indicate that Prust does not want to be here so unless someone has inside information anyone who says he doesnt want to be here is only speculating and gossiping. ,canucks,cywa6k6,1,t5_2qrs7

6266590,0,t3_41ej6s,So I work at the Ticket Centre at Rogers Arena and I feel like I need to give my opinion here. If youre looking for hockey tickets look for availability in the following order. Ticketmaster  Obvious reasons. Primary seller. NHL Ticket Exchange  nd tab on Ticketmaster. Where people with real Ticketmaster accounts are selling tickets.. StubHub  rd party seller of people reselling tickets with a chance of fakes but if you read their website if you encouter fakes and cant get in on the day of you can call their customer support line and they will email you PDF tickets that they have. Always ask for PDF copies and not the QR code tickets.. Vivid Seats  Same policies as StubHub but less popular.. Craigslist  Every incident where we get a pissed off fans asking why they cant get in to the building with tickets that they bought online is from Craigslist. Im not saying that all sales on Craigslist are fake but it would be the last source I suggest. If you do go this route just dont come to guest services and lie about getting takes from a friend of a friend who got it from his boss whos company owns the tickets.Someone showing you pictures of hard copy tickets or a Season Member booklet doesnt prove that they are legit tickets and will get you in. We have a couple hundred Season Member who are resellers and all they do is sell their tickets. Nothing is stopping them from selling you tickets from their booklet then calling in to us and asking us to reprint their tickets. We have to do this because they own the tickets and what they do with them doesnt concern us.If anyone has questions feel free to comment or PM me.,canucks,cz1xwqf,7,t5_2qrs7

Im not so sure hes as deft at managing seasoned pros but I suppose thats one area where hes light on experience and to be honest... given the way were going Im not sure its a big deal.  Its also got to be a pretty tough balancing act sometimes between fostering youth and supporting veterans.

We may not win every game but we are winning games and getting points when were not.We survived through a myriad of injuries and are slowly getting back to full health and are actually getting some secondary scoring to the point where Bo Bae Vrbata are essentially our first line now. We got hit hard earlier this year because the kids werent doing much Vrbata was snake bitten Higgins was here and we had injuries left right and Center. Biega is in and Weber is out and Prusts days as a Canuck may be numbered. Miller is back in attack mode.Unless we get another wave of injuries Id say were looking at a  pick possibly lower if we make the playoffs which Im totally okay with. We got Shink at  McCann at  Demko at  so long as we nab some draft picks by the deadline well be good.

You cant take these guys quotes straightforward every quote an insider gets from a GM is information that was intentionally leaked. It does not help Benning to say this unless hes trying to raise their trade value. Hes saying that if they dont get an offer they want they will just take the players and potentially push a bubble team out. This is a way of encouraging other bubble teams to try and move on Vrbata or Hammer and contenders to make stronger offers. ,canucks,czxxo47,5,t5_2qrs7

6676778,0,t1_d09v59a,I wouldnt mind Vey getting traded but McCann definitely needs to stay. I dont see any upside to getting rid of a young and talented center who is already on an NHL contract a year after getting drafted. Realistically McCann can only go up from here.Vey while slowly proving his worth and I mean SLOWLY is an expendable asset. Maybe Benning could tack him on to a trade that includes either Vrbata or Hammer to sweeten the pot. Getting a th line center along with an elite D man or top  winger is some real Billy Mays shit but it could end up tipping the scale in our favour if a trade actually happened.,canucks,d09xqm2,5,t5_2qrs7
6677055,0,t1_d09yfef,This is one of my gripes. Shink really was one of those players that could be such a dynamic goal scorer. We need his competitiveness. We need his offensive ability.

Does that sound like a winning ticket to you? Its getting you money back and if Hunter doesnt pan out to be anything than you won but Hunter has potential to be a winning lottery ticket fair enough if you want to play safe but on a rebuilding team with plenty of depth at center it makes no sense not to gamble on the unscratched lottery ticket,canucks,d0a3nwk,2,t5_2qrs7

6713426,0,t1_d0dgnoq,gtthe kid is youngNot as young as Shinkgtstill has time to developnot as much as Shinkgtacting like Granlund has already peaked offensively points in  games. Theres not a chance he doubles that output.  point guy is a pipe dream for this kid. Little less so for Shinkaruk.gtdont think he will translate over to the NHLTHINK being the key word. Kid never got a kick at the can in the NHL. Which doesnt make sense on a team that cant score goals especially where Shink shines the PP. So many other rookies got real looks despite not putting up as impressive a season as Shink. Why? Why did they get looks and not Shink? Read my initial post where I saygtShinkaruk looked like he couldve been a piece of the future and he was let go for a piece unanimously agreed to be less of an offensive presence on a team that is rd last in the NHL in goals per game without a real crack at the NHL on the GMs intuition. Tell me more about how I am supposed to be happy about that.Again you havent told me how Im supposed to be happy about getting a Vey upgrade for a guy who Im supposed to believe isnt going to be an NHL talent because GMJB said so remember that appeals to authority thing? when there was literally no reason for him to not get a look. Not one. The only reason anyone ever had for Shink not getting a look was let him tear it up all year in the AHL and carry the team and bring him up next year. Clearly doesnt count anymore. Anyways getting a look couldnt have hurt his trade value because apparently all the kid was worth was Linden Vey .. Not exactly a need for the club.gtif GMJB is right this trade makes a lot of senseNo it really doesnt. I dont really see how the expected value of Granlunds performance is so much greater than the expected value of Shinkaruks that this trade was ever a good idea seeing how Granlund is pretty much Linden Vey.Like I said Shink for a mild upgrade on Vey and a lowmid pick doesnt make sense. This team needs offense. Shink stands a lot better chance of being that than either the pick we get for Vey or Granlund do. ,canucks,d0dq531,2,t5_2qrs7

6841861,0,t1_d0rt6ra,gt So why is it that Mikael Backlund  a player with even better shot suppression numbers and shot generation numbers to Brown  has a worse CF . than either Crosby . or Brown .?Because the flames are legitimately terrible both systems and personnelwise. Its reflected in his relative numbers which are better than Browns. gtEven if you think Brown is exceptional at shot suppression do you really think that the nine Kings leading the league in CF are actually better possession players than the entire rest of the league? Do you think that the fifteen Kings with a better CF than Crosby Bergeron or Backlund are actually better possession players? No I dont. I think its systemsrelated and I think a few Kings players are legitimately elite possessiondrivers and they help inflate some of their numbers. gtI dont buy that Brown is a better possession player than Crosby for a second. Im willing to entertain the idea that he could have better differentials than Crosby even if they were on the same team I just also believe that even if thats the case Crosbys ability to drive percentages would more than make up for it anyway. I actually think were totally in agreement Im just clarifying. I do think that Corsi is heavily influenced by QoT and systems.

The other teams are huge possession driving teams with championship pedigrees in the ducks and kings. He doesnt have to be mcdavid or eichel to be an effective first liner. Look at Kopitar Bergeron toews Kesler and Getzlaf. They are all great players but none are perinial  point scorers. They dont need to be they contribute in so many ways that the coach wants them out  minutes a night. I still believe Bo can be that type of player for us.

7357664,0,t1_d2ecuz4,I do agree that in the ideal world my scenario above does not happen.  But the main question comes down to how much and how long do you resign Markstrom for?Markstrom is again a UFA.  Recent comparables who are RFAs like Talbot and Jones signed for  year deals worth  mil per and . mil per.  I would think that Markstrom would be looking for more term and money than both because he is more proven compared to the seasons Talbot and Jones had before they signed their contract and a UFA.  Even goalies like Bernier and Reimer carry  mil cap hits.  So what do you think is a reasonable contract for Markstrom a  year old first time UFA whos looking like a legitimate  goalie?Also I think the development play for Demko would be a lot smoother than Markstroms time in Florida.  When Markstrom was at Florida he was literally fed to the wolves with no veteran support or mentorship.  In the scenario I created Miller would be there to shelter and mentor Demko for at least  full season.  I do completely agree that it is rare for a goalie to be a starter at  and the last goalie I found that achieved this and maintained success is Price.  It does look like Murray in Pittsburgh might become their starter next season at the age of .  Murray is a  born player while Demko is a  born player.  I can see Demko going on a similar path as Murray who played  games in the AHL and  games in the NHL this year at  and he is in line for  games next season it seems.Markstrom is a UFA after this season so if he has a monster year he would be less inclined to sign an extension because he will receive better offers as an UFA.  The trade value on Markstrom during the season would be lower too since the team trading for him would have no control and limited time to sign him before he becomes a free agent.  How much would someone pay for a rental goalie?  The most comparable trade this season to Markstrom would be Bernier who was traded with Jeremy Morin for Stalock back up goalie Ben Smith bottom  and a th rounder this might be conditional.  Miller would not be a comparable as he was a superstarvezina caliber when he was traded.,canucks,d2eil9p,1,t5_2qrs7

He also has shown basically zero improvement so far on his offensive game. Nothing wrong with a dman who can play  minutes a night and who can take the unsexy assignments but is the franchise best suited giving up a  year old st round pick and the rd overall pick this year? Odds are this team has some semblance of contending potential around the  season... Right around the time youd expect a  st to really be making big contributions and perhaps can count on that  pick  giving you high value minutes on a rookie deal. Like many of his other trades this deal seems to fast track the organization in some areas. The question is will that fast tracking lead to something substantial? ,canucks,d3n5qv9,3,t5_2qrs7

9591993,0,t1_d9vd96z, Eriksson is there to fill a first line role while we rebuild. While having that cap room tied up in him isnt exactly a best case scenario it is important for rookies to come up in a winning environment and Eriksson is a skilled player who can help keep us from being Oilers bad. Jared McCann was an interesting prospect and we will have to see how that turns out. But either way getting a proven Defenceman in return is a good deal. McCann never had a first line ceiling and Gudbranson is a good player the numbers show it. We also have to remember that he is young and has plenty of time to develop even if the mustache makes us forget sometimes. Not sure who youre alluding to there. Hamhuis has been done already if it wasnt ownership throwing a wrench in things then it was Dallas wanting Russell anyway. And before you say Benning coulda got it done if he was a better GMmore respectedwhatever no he couldnt have it wasnt going to work. Dont forget that Hamhuis had a pretty limiting NTC. I would not advocate trading Hansen. Okay so we get a second round pick from an upandcoming team. Big whoop. Hansen is a great player who is highly underrated and frankly underpaid. We have a great locker room presence on a cheap contract who will be one of the few veterans on this team when our rebuild is coming to a close. Having his type of player on a rebuilding team is incredibly important and theyre also not that easy to find. He can still produce and he can teach. Not trading him is a good thing. Not signing agents is not a rebuild move but neither is it an antirebuild move as youre suggesting. Personally yes I would have liked to see a move or two like that made so far but Im certainly not crying over it. The loss of a potential say rd and th round pick isnt exactly enough to send me over the edge. Sbisa is and always was meant to be a stopgap. Lets not forget that Sbisa was brought in in the Kesler trade. Its well known that Anaheim was essentially the only place he would go and Benning did well to get both Bonino and Sbisa out of it. At the time Sbisa still had potential to be good and so yes it was a bit of a risk but a good one even though it didnt pan out given the lack of choice he was given. Sbisas contract is up after next season anyway and its worked out perfectly that hes the best we can offer in the expansion draft. Regardless of whether or not you think it was a bad move its worked out beautifully for that alone. Markus Granlund makes k. I dont know where youre getting your numbers from. Dont try and pretend like losing Kassian was a huge loss for us. Has he turned it around in Edmonton now after two years? Yeah sure. But with us he was just as much a dumpster fire as Hodgson even more really. Suspensions penalties stone hands he didnt really do anything for us except fill the role of Torreslite. We didnt need him. Im happy hes doing well now and I wish we might have had him at his best but I dont at all regret the choice to get rid of him.I think youre missing the point of this rebuild. Benning has said over and over that hes building this team from the net out and that is very much apparent now. We have a good goalie situation and our future defence core is looking good. If we can get our forward situation sorted in the next  years well have a healthy stock of prospects at all positions ready to go. Answer me this  . Is our prospect pool significantly better than it was two years ago?  . Is our team noticeably younger than it was two years ago?My answer to both is yes. And thats incredibly important. This team is trending in the right direction for a rebuild. When Lindenning came in Im sure they were hoping they could retool on the fly. That hasnt panned out and you can tell that theyve adjusted course because of that. Less guys like Sbisa Prust and Vrbata coming in and more guys like Gudbranson Granlund and Baertschi.All Im trying to say is Benning and Linden arent perfect and yes the rebuild got off to a rocky start. But youd have to be blind to say it isnt heading in the right direction now and in a couple years I guarantee you that it will look better still.,canucks,d9vereq,1,t5_2qrs7
9595849,0,t1_d9vereq, Eriksson might be a valuable player for the next few years although right now hes not looking too hot already but imagine what hes going to look like in  years  M cap when we actually should be ready to make a push? Thats a ton of dead cap space because of a ridiculously stupid mistake made in the summer of . All the numbers show is that Gudbranson is a replaceable level player. He was a  in Florida and after a solid start to the season has regressed back into that form for us. Hes not that young anymore and already a veteran he is what he is and he will not be improving especially the weaknesses of his game which is puckhandling and transition. Look out for that pricey new contract too. Alluding the the draft picks wasted on Vey Clendening Pedan Baertschi Dorsett etc. Good GMs make things work. It was on the record that Hamhuis waived to at least two teams. You cant excuse every mistake Benning makes because of the circumstances. Martin St. Louis requested a trade to just one single team and Yzerman still managed to acquire a haul. If youre expecting your GM to only make the easy predictable moves then you might as well have a monkey or potato as your GM. At last years deadline with . years still left on his contract Hansen would be worth more than a nd round pick. Likely a lowst or equivalent prospect who would become one our best prospects instantly because of our shallow pool. Death by a thousand cuts. Benning apologists will always say its not a big deal for every draft pick he pisses away yet how many dozens of quality players come out of the bottom  rounds? The draft is like a lottery you want as many lottery tickets as possible especially if youre rebuilding. No at the time Sbisa had already busted and everyone but Benning knew it. It was just one of the first major examples of his and his teams poor pro scouting. He actually thought Sbisa was a valuable piece whereas Anaheim saw him as a cap dump. I can imagine that phone call between Murray and Benning Benning demands they add Sbisa to get the deal done and Murray pretends to be hesitant but inside hes laughing. What is Sbisa a stopgap for? Consider that they traded Garrison for almost nothing and then replaced his salary with Sbisas. Then also consider that if Sbisa wasnt given that extension we would have had room to keep Hamhuis who would be a great cheap veteran to have to show the kids the way instead of the Erikssons Dorsetts and Prusts. Talking about Sutter of course. If they werent able to fix him then there are other ways to let him go. Buy him out if you need to. Dont trade away a th round pick to acquire an AHL player.. Of course our prospect pool is better than two years ago. Benning has had the luxury of picking instead the top twice and will likely do it again next summer. But thats not because he wanted to its because his team  was so bad on accident that it just happened.. Younger sure. Young enough? No. Good enough? Hell no. Future good enough? Another hell no.I wont say they are heading in the right direction until they trade all the vets that need to be traded accumulate a large amount of draft picks and stop acquiringsigning older andor bad players to awful contracts. Until then nothing has changed and we will waste year upon year waiting for them to get fired so someone new can come in and rebuild properly. I cant believe the free pass they are getting its sickening. They have led the team into complete incompetence and some actually have the audacity to preach thats its part of the plan? It was never part of plan. Remember when Babcock had his first interview in Toronto and said theres gonna be pain? That was a team that actually planned for a rebuild and made all their moves to supplement it. What we did is make moves to try to get better on the fly for the last  years and weve fallen right on our face. If Benning had actually started the proper rebuild when he took the job in  we would already be coming out of it by now. Instead it hasnt even started and we probably have to wait another  years minimum before we see the light at the end of the tunnel.,canucks,d9vvui6,1,t5_2qrs7

9992668,0,t1_dba0gvn,gtI dont buy the stay competitive but genuinely sucking of these said teams. While no team is going to go into a season saying we are so bad lets lose boys! these teams were realistic about their situation and were factually stockpiling assets and to me very much rebuilding. This CAN NOT be said about the Canucks in the last  years. They have done their absolute best to completely skip the stockpiling and sucking part.Again you and I agree on this part. We agree that the Canucks are not one of these teams who were realistic about their situation and were factually stockpiling assets and to me very much rebuilding. What we disagree on or I think maybe youre coming around on? Maybe Im reading that wrong? is I believe that OP was correct in assessing that there do exist such teams who try to be competitive at the start of each season but by the TDL realize theyre in bad condition and are willing to sell selectively not wholesale to accrue picks and futures and that CHITBLLAKPIT are examples of such teams. Has nothing to do with what the Canucks are doing  just whether you think OP is onto something with the CHITBLLAKPIT model or not. If Im reading it wrong and youre not coming around to this Id like to know why but please dont use the Canucks as an example because as I said were not executing the model properly.gtI just do not understand why these additions are so toxic for the Canucks especially considering how many slots they have open and considering how bad the Utica team is.Fair enough especially about the waiver claims. I completely agree that I have zero clue why some of those player werent claimed  or why we didnt bother claiming Etem back considering he wouldve been cleared to go straight to the AHL. Although that does bring up the point that the other waiver claims may not have been able to get to Utica as we wouldve had to subject them to waivers again and that would just allow their original team to slide them right into their farm team like we couldve done with Etem. So I guess Im rambling a bit but I dont think that the waiver wire is a good place to fill the farm from. Its an interesting thought though.,canucks,dba2miw,1,t5_2qrs7

10355737,0,t1_dchnm93,The biggest thing about the Sedins cycle play is movement. And theres none of that in the PP this season. Its the most stationary unit Ive seen. No one is getting into positions to score like you mentioned. Thats not going to have results. Yeah the Sedins are slower and cant do the things they used to they cant keep the movement going the same way but the supporting cast is not doing it either. They are the ones that should be doing it while Sedins are feeding them but they are just bad.Stecher provided a little bit of that in NovemberDecember but its a long season for a guy who is used to play  games in a season. To me hes been losing some of his early season jump recently. And hes the only capable PP QB this roster has. Baertschi at the point is bad. Very stationary doesnt really do anything. To put it nicely he is not a threat there. And Sutter is of course the worst and most useless PP player Ive ever seen. Not only does he not provide any movement to the unit or open space and spots for other guys the play just dies anytime he goes near or touches the puck. Its a disaster.,canucks,dchvsw4,4,t5_2qrs7

10466088,0,t1_dcu255m,The question is the type of deal they were looking for at the time. If they were looking for help for their NHL team by all accounts they were they did OK but Im not sure that was the right decision with Kesler. To me if youre trading a guy like Kesler you need to get at least one asset back that has a chance at making a similar impact. I think they needed to get the th overall as a starting point. Or perhaps target a guy like Vatanen. But they traded him for depth pieces essentially. At the time thats what they were looking for but in hindsight targeting Anaheims younger players would have been more ideal. And if Anaheim didnt want to include those young assets you sit Kesler until they do or he opens up his trade list. Water under the bridge now but I was disappointed with the return at the time and the resulting transactions havent left me any more enamored. I was also a big Kesler fan though. ,canucks,dcufrlm,7,t5_2qrs7

It was mental seeing it broadcast somewhere other than my laptop and at a social hour! Needless to say about  people gathered around and for the next couple hours Id hung out with fellow Canucks fans for the first time and it was awesome.

10814375,0,t3_5ukswk,Totally welcome aboard. Heres your primer. We havent won a cup ever. Weve come real close twice. We rioted both times which really isnt cool. For one most of the rioters of the most recent loss were from the suburbs and a good number of them really fucked over their futures including one kid whose swimming scholarship was taken away when social media started posting pictures of him rioting. We should really stop doing that especially since the people who live in Vancouver actually really care about their city and spent the entire next day cleaning up the streets boarding up broken windows etc.. Fuck Messier. He may be one of the biggest HallofFamers and universally liked across most of the league but in Vancouver he is the fucking devil and he and his bald face can go trip on a rock while Skyping Connor McDavid on a fishing trip.. Trevor Linden is the heart and soul of the Canucks and has been since the late s. Pavel Bure is the most exciting player to put on a Canucks Jersey. The West Coast Express was one of the bestbuilt first lines weve ever seen. The Sedins are utterly dazzling with their passing plays.. We brought playoff towelwaving to the NHL. I shit you not Towel Power was a Vancouver thing. Theres a great story behind it that someone else would probably be happy to tell you.. Were in an unhappy rebuilding state right now which means we suck at the moment but we have some promising things that could be very exciting in the future Bo Horvat is almost about to break  points at age  thats actually PHENOMENAL and the fastest weve seen someone make  points since Pavel Bure Olli Juolevi could become an Erik Karlssonesque defender that would be the kind of blueliner that could make us a very exciting team in the nottoodistant future Thatcher Demko is just starting to gain his professional legs but could be the Franchise goaltender of the future and right now hes working with arguably one of the best goalie coaches in the business in our farm team.. Opinions vary wildly on the current management. Some feel weve got the worst in the league some feel that were actually doing great given the situation were in the truth is probably somewhere right in between. Fact of the matter is that our management is still very green when it comes to NHL operations. Our GM was an assistant GM for a Stanley Cupwinning team our coach is often considered a great development coach though his ability to be competitive at the NHL level is quite in question and our President is working his first ever job in Hockey Ops for any club let alone an NHL one. So mistakes are bound to be made. I feel like theyre getting fewer and further between and some of the blatantly horrible moves we previously made are actually not looking so bad in hindsight Shinkaruk for Granlund Sbisa extension waiving Corrado.

A Canadian working visa is for working in Canada. If youre an employee that has never entered Canada theres no time or place for border control to ask you for your visa. Youll be asked to pay taxes in Canada regardless of whether you have a visa or not because CRA doesnt care about your visa status. BB can work in the US for a Canadian company without a visa.

11453861,0,t1_dfu98fv,I see this myth all the time and its completely untrue. The Leafs made many smart trades signings before they got Matthews. They employed many young progressive analytics oriented managers such as Kyle Dubas and completely revamped their scouting staff and now a lot of their prospects look pretty good. They traded away many veterans like Kessel and Phaneuf and brought on cheap veterans to ship off at the deadline for more picks Polak for two ns rounders for example. They were smart enough to start their rebuild in a good draft year and even though they didnt get McDavid Marner is pretty damn good too. Their management team was getting a lot of praise WAY before they won the lottery. Yeah maybe they wouldnt be as good now but theyd still be well on their way to a successful rebuild. I guess you could say they were lucky that Nylander fell to th overall in  though. I dont know where you got the Oilers from but they won  lotteries in a row before they got McDavid. How did that work for them? Yea McDavid is much better than Yak RNH and Hall but it wasnt until they fired MacT and Lowe and brought in Ciarelli that they started to turn it around. Edmonton would suck if they didnt have talbot as well and Cia made a great trade to get him. The Larson trade is also working out wonderfully for them and not so well for New Jersey even though that trade for absolutely roasted at the time. ,canucks,dfuabxk,5,t5_2qrs7

11526164,0,t3_64i3vt,I mean all of your points are valid but theyre also the most negative possible interpretations. For instance you choose to see the additions of Dahlen and Goldobin as minor upgrades over McCann and our OA. Valid I suppose but its also valid to see them as very good individual trades for old veterans.You also claim that they were trying to be competitive but this is the best they can muster by giving up futures. Kind of valid but you can also say that they gave up further futures for closer futures trying to remain competitive in the sense of not bottoming out rather than truly believing they can go deep in the playoffs. If the team was seriously giving up futures for true competitiveness they dont target young projects and RFAs they trade futures for established veterans who can help now. Thats not what they did.And as far as this being a bad result for what they gave up were some targets bad? Absolutely. Were they all? Absolutely not. Gudbranson was a bad target but Granlund was a good one. Sutter was a bad target but Baertschi was a good one. Vey was a bad target but Boucher was a good one  and free IIRC  GMs passed on him before Benning snatched him up. Theyve wasted some assets but capitalized on others so wouldnt it make sense to see and acknowledge both?In terms of cap flexibility yeah were near the ceiling. However we did shed Burrows .M which is great because while we all loved him he wasnt worth nearly that much. Were also shedding Millers M right now and replacing that contract with something most likely a lot cheaper. The Sedins M will also be coming off next year and well also be replacing those with something much cheaper. Yes we are coming up to resigning a bunch of our RFAs but if youve noticed anything with Benning and extensions is that hes actually mostly been decenttogreat with them. Hutton Baertschi Etem  they all got either market value or below market value. The one overpaid RFA extension is Sbisa. His UFA extensions include Tanev Markstrom and Beiga all of whom got market value or in Tanevs case way below market value. The one overpaid UFA extension is Dorsett. Benning tends to badly overpay his trade targetsUFA acquisitions Sutter Eriksson Miller and he whiffed on Dorsett and Sbisas extensions but  out of  of his inhouse extensions have been good with the  bad ones being  of his earliest extensions. Hes also said that hes looking to sign Gudbranson to a oneyear extension. Thats ideal and one can reasonably argue that hes come to be much better with extensions. So in context we likely have a lot more dead weight coming off the books than well be adding to it. Lets acknowledge that also?My point is that your take on the teams situation seems to be voluntarily negative. Thats cool if thats how you like to look at things but just realize that while there are objective reasons to be negative there are also plenty of objective reasons to not be solely negative.,canucks,dg2hqnk,11,t5_2qrs7

Learn how to draft better in later rounds sign reasonable contracts make trades for positional needs if possible.It seems like Im in the minority here but I think the salary cap provides all the parity this league needs.
