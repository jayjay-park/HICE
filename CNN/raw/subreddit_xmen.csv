I mean obviously they would have to change up gambits hair and shorten it up a little bit and get rid of the part down the middle to keep him looking somewhat contemporary but to me tatums face looks too roundish for someone as squarejawed and kind of lanky as gambit.,xmen,cf3agol,3,t5_2s4cn

But eventually his mind will return from  into his future body and then his  self wont remember what happened to him while he was inhabited by his future self since its not the same mind. At least thats what I am assuming with the information we currently have.Generally its very difficult to discuss plot elements or the impact of Days of Future Past on the timeline since we dont know yet the ramifications that movie will bring. Thats why I said in the introduction that DOFP might very well change this timeline. This timeline as I have posted it is the current version based on all the information we have so far.

It would be an interesting twist on the ubiquitous police procedural and it would show off some of the less famous characters like Madrox Monet Siryn etc. New Mutants either Dani Moonstars team or the newer one with Wind Dancer Elixir Wallflower etc. would be interesting too. Maybe aimed more for a younger audience as it shows the kids in school.

1056792,0,t1_chnqznw,While I dont totally agree about your point on the Xmen films I get where you are coming from. I think what helps the Marvel films is that they treat it as a separate universe Earth  in their overall properties so they arent necessarily an adaptation of the Earth  events theyre alternate universe versions of those events even though in our world theyre drawn from comic material. So if they ever get the rights to Xmen back expect them to be introduced in the MCU in a way that more closely follows the comics. At least I hope thats what will happen. ,xmen,choeu64,1,t5_2s4cn

1072080,0,t3_26dxbh,As far as where to start reading heres my cut amp paste response for every time this is asked I recommend starting with Chris Claremonts run that made the XMen popular  Uncanny XMen  the graphic novel God Loves Man Kills XMen Vignettes  amp  and XMen .Theres also a good documentary about Chris Claremonts XMen My favorite story arcs in chronological order. Proteus Uncanny   their first really dangerous enemy. Dark Phoenix Saga   widely considered the best ever not my favorite though. Issue  will give you a nice recap of all the previous events.. Days of Future Past   Kitty travels back in time from a dystopian future. God Loves Man Kills graphic novel  possibly the best place for a newcomer to start. The Brood Saga    a mix of Alien amp The Matrix includes the first meeting of Magneto amp Professor X  and the first meeting of the Xmen amp Rogue. Wolverine ClaremontMiller limited series   the first Wolverine comics mustread. From the Ashes   great run. Havok amp Wolverine Meltdown limited series   highly recommended great artwork. Inferno  ties in with XFactor etc  typical sprawling Xover the XMen issues are better than the XFactor amp New Mutants etc.. Joss Whedons Astonishing XMen run  the Warren Ellis run after this is also good. The Whedon run also has an amazing motion comic partially available on Netflix.Stuff that didnt make the cut  Uncanny   theres some good stuff here but for me its not as good as the previous stuff. Highlights include Lifedeath tpb and issue  is a mustread for Wolverine fans.  Uncanny   I think this run is worth checking out. It includes  story arcs The Reavers and the XMens move to Australia the return of the Brood Genosha and Inferno. This would be a good time to check out the Wolverine unlimited series.  Theres some good stuff after this esp Psylocke becoming a ninja  and Wolverine amp Cap America in  but its in a bit of a decline although Jim Lees art is incredible.Grant Morrisons New XMen run gets recommended a lot but personally I think its overrated.,xmen,chq5ejc,2,t5_2s4cn

Cyke had the weird blasts Emma lost most of her psychic abilities and Magnetos power level was severely decreased. Im not sure what happened with Namor. So the Phoenix messed with their powers directly and then Cyke messed up Magnetos during the last big fight. Phoenix is said to have caused all of the power problems. Now suddenly Bendis says it was nanosentinels. If it really is nanosentinels that caused their powers to mess up then how do they explain it? Did Dark Beast infect them while they had the Phoenix? If so how? Why were all of their powers changed at the same time? And why waste an opportunity to evolve the abilities of these characters on a throwaway plot? ,xmen,cic20zy,2,t5_2s4cn

3157590,0,t3_2w8v67,Schism is a pretty bad storyline. Its basically the result of Marvel wanting their cake and eating it too by which I mean that they wanted to keep the Utopia setting but also bring back the school.To carry the other side they needed a popular character and whos more popular than Wolverine? So despite the fact that Wolverine has always been a fan of tossing kids into the fray and you know murdering people he suddenly launched an antiviolence crusade on behalf of kids that didnt ask for it.Whats even worse is that the entire foundation for the schism story doesnt really make any sense.The reason Wolverine wants to take the kids away and start up the school again is primarily because hea Thinks the children arent safe on Utopia and would be safer at the school. b Feels it is wrong that the kids be forced to participate in active combat.But neither of these are true. The kids arent safer at the school. Theres a reason the XMen left the school in the first place. Because it got destroyed on a regular basis and because a bussload of kids were killed there by humans without the XMen able to do anything about it. Utopia is an island stronghold guarded by some of the most powerful people on the planet. Think of what theyve endured there a vampire invasion undead mutants invading supercharged Juggernaut a Nimrod army led by Bastion the Dark Avengers and so on. As for the kids being forced to participate in combat again thats not true. No one is forced to fight. The kids want to fight. There were loads of noncombatant civilians living on Utopia. There were even former supervillains who were allowed to live there and enjoy the XMens protection without actually having to fight. Hell the event that triggers the schism and pisses Wolverine off only happens because Wolverine was out drinking instead of doing his job. So yeah Schism tries to weave a story where two sides are equally right and wrong yet straight off the bat makes one positions side indefensible and makes the person leading that side a massive hypocrite. Its a badly made story no matter how you spin it. ,xmen,copa5rg,1,t5_2s4cn

Keep his origin intact with him being a mid century scientist who did cruel experiments on mutants until he met Apocalypse who transformed him.And his goal is to create a new species beyond human or mutant. And hes not all about being a big brute fighter. Hes a master manipulator and incredibly smart villain always ten steps ahead. Even when fighting him he has little actual concern in fighting and simply reforms his body from attacks and hits them with an energy beam then triggers a trap on them nonchalant as he leaves to go continue his plans. Showcasing hes powerful but doesnt even care about fighting the xmen. His plans are all he cares about and their interference is more like flies nagging him than anything else. And he merely leads them into traps and manipulates them to serve his needs.Given Apocalypse is shown in ancient Egypt we know hes existed for centuries in the movieverse so no reason Sinisters origin cant work if tied to him.Sinister is my fav X villain so Id love to see him done right.,xmen,ct635eb,1,t5_2s4cn

As Liefeld XForce creator someone who has been close to the script said himself Everything changed when XMen Apocalypse was announced If Fox wants to try to have a connected XMen universe that rivals the Marvel Cinematic Universe using characters from multiple movies XMen and solo films to combine as XForce would be a good strategy. Three of the characters that were mentioned in the earlier rumor Deadpool Colossus Psylocke are already known to be in the upcoming XMen universe movies with Deadpool and Colossus in the Deadpool movie and Psylocke in Apocalypse. The other two members could easily be introduced in these two movies as well.

7762210,0,t1_d3ohbxa,gtThis is the main problem with numerical ratings because movies are such a fluid thing to judge. Depending on the time you see it and after thinking about it its difficult to assign a rating to it. So its not enough just to look at the score gotta look at the subjective criticisms and opinions of whoever is talking.Which in itself is difficult. Realistically the whole idea of a critic is just stupid because no two people will ever agree on every single thing. One of my friends does a movie podcast and we agree on a lot of movies so youd think i could trust his ratings however he gave this movie a . while i put it at a much lower . But he is also unable to judge objectively as hes never given any comic movie less than an . I know how it is to grow up a comic nerd and finally see all this characters in live action movies but it doesnt mean they are all good.Likewise to professional critics who rate movies with the assumption they should all be oscar winning masterpieces and thats why movies like transformers get such low scores. Was it great? No of course not but for a mindless summer blockbuster it did what it set out to do. Ill never forget one review i read that said it was nothing but robots fighting and explosions. Well... yeah its transformers.Ive seen tons of movies with bad scores that i loved and movies with good scores i hated. I just dont see how a professional critic is still something that exists,xmen,d3oi3vr,1,t5_2s4cn
7767072,0,t1_d3oauji,Honestly I totally agree with your first two points in a huge way but I think thats just a vocal minority we can completely disregard as the real issue.        As someone who has focused a lot of my life on the art of crafting a story the problem with this movie was immediately recognizable and while I thoroughly enjoyed the movie because I thought the casting was great and the nods to not only the comics but even to previous XMen films were really well done and seemed to be both clever story telling AND fan service... I also picked up on the films major failing within  minutes.        The problem with Apocalypse is that there was no protagonist. You can argue that there are great nearly perfect films that lack a protagonist and actually are successful because of their ensemble cast but this was not one of them. The problem with XMen above most comic book films is that the XMen take the ensemble approach more than perhaps any other super team. This works for the comic format and especially for a format thats so long form but it doesnt really work in a  hour film. Other XMen movies had some serious faults but they worked by electing a protagonist to follow throughout the film by giving them a single character to latch onto above all others. Apocalypse failed to do that. It was incredibly jarring early on because the movie jumped in and started setting the stage in a number of different locations giving us very brief and tothepoint introductions of new characters and extremely rushed updates on the current state of familiar characters. It was really jarring to the average audience member because while theatre goers ARE discerning and intelligent they also on the whole prefer to have a clear understanding of a main character first. It gives them a safe place  for instance if Xavier or Mystique had been given a long segment at the beginning of the film that clarified their current status in terms of where they were in their path what they wanted and what they were doing to get it... the audience would have been less uneasy about all the jumping around whenever that characters subplot returned to the screen.        Edit Glaring and hilarious typo. None of you pointed it out and now none of you will ever know how funny it was.        Second edit The other really jarring thing early in the movie is the amount of time spent on updating Magneto. It seemed like he was getting the most attention of anyone and yet his subplot seemed really unnecessary and over the top. I had trouble suspending disbelief there  I did not believe that would have happened not for a second. I think the holocaust trigger would have been enough for him to immediately without hesitation use that necklace to kill all of those men the moment he saw them with his daughter. I dont think that what Xaviers teachings did for him were enough to stop him in that scenario nor do I think that they meant nothing to him. Because of that he could have murdered those men to save his family and the rest of his actions in the film STILL would have been believable. I think the writing went WAY too far with treating the audience like we were unintelligent on this one. Oh we need to justify Magnetos betrayal like No Hitler already did that. Now youre beating a dead horse.,xmen,d3p1yw8,7,t5_2s4cn

Pivotal  Stephen Lang and his orbital HQ. Pivotal  Hellfire Club yes Pivotal as they fund Langs HQ and Masterminds manipulation is the trigger for the Phoenix to turn Dark.  The ShiAr pivotal  Some other civilization to be destroyed  The Kree not necessary  The Blue Area of the Moon not necessary but preferredJust by the Hellfire Club and the ShiAr you gotta add so many characters it would be best suited as a trilogy with movie  the TraskintoLang storyline movie  being LangintoHellfire then the last one being HellfireintoShiAr climaxing with the entire X roster battling a Phoenixcontrolled Jean.Yes we both know wed watch the shit out of that trilogy but the average movie goer would find really hard to pick up the third one without seeing the previous at the very least.Too much work as well.

Anyone think Apocalypse  could take more than a million.And I seem to recall back when Apocalypse was first announced Bryan Singer spoke about Apocalypse cant kill Apocalypse and that plans were for the character to appear in second X me  film and a Fantastic Four movie that would bridge FF to the XMen.They way the film ended with Apocalypse battling the Phoenix he read her mind and said all has been revealed He had the same expression Professor X had when he let Phoenix tear him several new holes before he turns to dust.

So I guess is Xavier decided to die instead of existing in astral form.  Of course Spiderman was dead and in heaven with Uncle Ben but his latent memories returned to fight Doc Ock for control over Peters body. And Red Skull had previously put his brain in a cloned body of Captain America... so if Xavier could take control of Red Skulls mind he would have access to similiar technology and be able to grow himself a new body.My guess is that they will just use the cosmic cube to hit the undo button.,xmen,d4918ir,1,t5_2s4cn

This is a more interesting concept but not a more interesting fight.. Check to see whether Iron Man built a device to neutralize the key XMens powers. If so the Avengers win by default.. Check to see whether Beast built a device to neutralize Vision or whether Magnetos powers can fight Visions Infinity Gem or whether Professor Xs mind control works on Vision. If not the Avengers win by default.. Patrick Stewart Professor X and XFilms Quicksilver disable almost all the Avengers in the first  seconds of the fight leaving only those who are too tough to be mind controlled or punched Thor Vision Hulk and Cap.. Magneto and Vision engage in a lame Dragonball Z yellfest and cancel each other out. Professor X makes the Hulk snap again keeping Thor busy. Cap and Wolverine fruitlessly punch each other for several minutes. The other  XMen try to all zap Thor at the same time. If they succeed the XMen win. If they dont the Avengers win.

You simply gave various superlatives without really details...Thirdly the golden age was because they were all planned out and guided by basically one person Chris Claremont which is a much more consistent and complicated narrative mind than the ones weve had since and even if we get a good writer they dont stay long enough or have the power to really do what they want anyway so we cant have really interesting stories or much changesHowever I think Bunn who writes the current Uncanny XMen is doing a good job given the limitations. ,xmen,d7nl66c,2,t5_2s4cn

9392858,0,t1_d96786z,Yeah I dont understand why some folks are saying Deadpool when it is so tangential to the XMen franchise. And you dont really need Origins or Apocalypse since X does a really great job establishing Logans backstory with the Weapon X project. First Class has nothing to do with Wolverine other than a cameo and can be skipped. The Wolverine is more of a side quest rather than adding anything to build on for future stories or providing any major subtext that wasnt already there. Last Stand is just bad and is basically undone by DoFP. You could almost skip DoFP but its damn good and does offer up the idea of a bleak future for mutants and Logan is front and center for most of the film.

The universe they created with Magneto going bad and coming around at the end a lot and Mystique becoming a hero because her actress became a sensation along with the decades of time jumps not aging people is too full.

9802905,0,t1_dalaoqq,still somewhat new to the subreddit so bare with me Ive been a fan of Bobby for some time and hes always been one of my favorite XMen. I think I know KINDA where youre coming from because they handled the outing in such a piss poor way. Having Young Jean just blurting it out to Young iceman was a major wut moment to me.... but it doesnt discredit it as pandering or the like. There have been a long list of GayLesbianBi Xmen before this so I can see why youd feel that they didnt need to turn someone gay. The article that has been linked does point out that Bobby never did have many stable relationships and there was a lot of room for people to wonder if he might have been secretly gay. Was I on board with the choice? not  but Im interested is seeing how they ACTUALLY address it with this series since they really havent dealt with ADULT Bobby coming to terms with it only the younger version. I personally think this book is gonna be a fun ride since at the heart of it its still the same Bobby Drake I grew up loving.,xmen,dalf3gy,7,t5_2s4cn

So that is not a good argument.  gtshes basically the field leader of the XMenAnd she was useless in battle. Like how Scott was field leader in the original trilogy and similarly useless. You want to say that those movies were centered around him? gtShes got the role of being between Xavier and lensherr as the sort of rd force that they compete over winning to their side repeatedly. Repeatedly? Thats only happened in First Class. In DOFP Erik tried to kill her and she later kicked his ass. gtShe was central to the plot in DoFP.She was an important element sure. But she also was in the original story in the comics. That movie and Apocalypse are really about Xavierthe overall leader of the team fixing his past with his friendsErik Raven and Jean.

10494576,0,t1_dcxgauh,Since when?  X is open to more than just a specific team sure but XMen is itself a specific thing a team stemming from Professor Xaviers ideology and legacy. That team changes morphs over time yeah but the XMen handle is deliberately always used to indicate lineage to Xaviers original team.  This and Legion can totally be X shows and not XMen shows.  I also would like to point out that since television is a completely different medium from the movies and the comics its also possible for showrunners to give us a completely new definition for XMen that ignores everything else. Narrative license allows them that freedom to basically say in this show this is what XMen are  but . That would contradict the notion that this exists in the same universe as the Xmovies because if it does then XMen are already a thing and . All we have is a pitch that this show is about Mutants and nothing Ive read has explicitly said that this is intended to be an actual XMen show.  I understand that the XMen is a brand and their universe extends far beyond their core team but I also think its a bit obtuse to offer branding as a defense of sensational clickbait headlines using XMen as a buzzword to attract attention about this new show that so far is in no real way sounding like an XMen show.,xmen,dcxo581,1,t5_2s4cn

The other comment being referred to here is basically saying that it makes sense for men to talk about this sort of stuff in a male space. Or even more basically this restriction would be characters only talk about things when it makes sense to talk about those things. Ok. That seems reasonable. . avoid misogynistic stories. Im guessing thats not what youre objecting to since I doubt youre a misogynist. And then the commentor goes on to make his main point hes concerned that any even remotely troubled comments even his own which likes the art and which only puts very minor and very reasonable conditions out there is being downvoted into oblivion or crazily misrepresented. Anyway since what paying customers care about is one of your priorities let me add that I someone with the entire Xline as part of my pull definitely agree that xmen needs more quiet moments where characters hang out bro out but definitely do not agree that it needs more moments where characters chat about which of their palsacquaintancescolleagues are most bangable. ,xmen,deckyrc,8,t5_2s4cn

11020941,0,t1_deh6jgz,Oh thats a good point. Actually what happens is he goes into Logans mind to get his memories. I think its assumed he doesnt get all of them just pieces of them. So I wouldnt say he has a detailed knowledge of the future but he would have some knowledge of it. That would explain him mentioning the Statue of Liberty if that event never happened. In the film he mentions it more as if he was there but its not very specific.I think its safe to assume Xavier gave Logan the info about the new timeline he said they had a lot of catching up to do. No idea if he could have downloaded memories into him. Its always kinda bummed me out that essentially the Logan from the new timeline died. How much did the Professor tell him?
