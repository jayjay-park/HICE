419007,0,t3_1yukg4,Wellwritten and I feel nothing but sympathy for the authors situation but it does make me feel... well... odd. Because what shes describing can be said about a lot of good romantic stories regardless of who has which bits and how those bits match up.Robert Frost said something vaguely along the lines of if theres no drama theres no story. Thats what we tune in for thats what keeps us reading or watching. Its the very struggles she detests that make the story worth telling. Hell its her struggles that make the article so compelling!And not to get too rmensrights about this but if this were written by a man about how the women in movies always go for a different type of man than himself I dont think we would feel very much sympathy for him. The less honest critics would say he should stop pining for women who arent interested in him the less sympathetic would tell him to get a life while the more honest would tell him to stop pushing his desires and his expectations onto these women that he has no right to demand they want him by virtue of the fact that he wants them.And thats my question for the author who are you to expect that these women should love you back? Who are you to expect their sexuality to match yours? We all experience falling for someone and instead of landing in their arms we land on our face. For homosexuals there are certainly added complications to put it lightly. But shouldnt it start with respect? Respecting a persons sexuality or simply their taste in partners. Respecting our own sexuality and our own tastes in partners. Because falling in love is a choice. Because when we spend our lives pining after those who could never love us back were only robbing ourselves of the chance to ever fall in love and be loved back. Out there somewhere are others in the same situation. And those are the people we should be seeking out. That is where the choice comes in.,vignettes,cfo71zx,1,t5_2z5o5

3411797,0,t3_2z9f5i,I think K.T. Bradfords challenge was more about making a point than anything else. A small number of people will follow through on this entirely. Realistically a few people might read a few more minority authors than they would have if she hadnt gotten their attention. Scalzi wont take his books off the market.This is what shitstirrers do and usually why they do it. Although the Amanda Marcotte types are more likely angry wounded people with no real point to make and no real incentive to engage honestly.,vignettes,cph64l3,5,t5_2z5o5
3885233,0,t3_34y0f7,I went back to college at .  I started at community college finished at a state school about k in debt.  I figured I had a decent shot of earning that out of school.Two hundred resumes later I was hired at a deli making . an hour.  Yes I majored in psychology but I didnt expect to make k a year I expected entry level office work.  I am very lucky to live with my mother in law and I can actually make debt payments.  If I had to support myself it would be impossible.It is very frustrating to do everything right and have never earned k a year.  ,vignettes,cqz5eyb,4,t5_2z5o5
