5629406,0,t1_cwurs8z,Not to my knowledge but as far as the icon goes I have a few gripes warning Ill be theorizing basing entirely on these tiny blobs of pixels now The mouth only three icons have a different mouth than the others Dark Judas lacking one The Keeper icon looks like Greed and this guy. Why would he have this distorted maw if he was Lazarus two?   The eyes are more spaced out than any other icon. Again the face is distorted and this shows it   The only character to have hair or facial hair rather that is not marked on the icon is the Keeper but his icon is a mystery of its own everybody expected the name Keeper to be associated with Greedlike character the icon looks that way too but he is an old man looking more like a St. Peter or such. I kind of want to believe the current sprites are a red herring but... no matter. Still lack of defined hair doesnt support Lazarus guess much. The icon appears to have horns similar but less defined than Lilith. This is not inline with theory about it being a playable Hush but doesnt fit Lazarus   The other two lines are... not sure what. Another pair of horns? Pubertystyle hair? No idea but is another thing that adds to the distorteddemorphed feel   While it doesnt have to show a character that well see the Keeper iconcharacter differences the icons seem to at least correspond to the character in one way or another Keeper more about how the name makes one guess what he could be this th one seems to communicate something quite inhuman,themoddingofisaac,cwuvqy3,2,t5_34xs3

10454024,0,t1_dcsyudo,Sorry if I came off as rough I honestly appreciate the feedback and hold no ill will towards you or your suggestion! Its great to see people who dont enjoy my tutorials as much to tell me how they feel about them.I think I completely understand you now and also realize why my videos didnt strike a chord with you you are looking for a tutorial that focuses on a specific thing and want an algorithmic solution with the included API calls for Lua etc. but the purpose of my videos was completely the opposite I was trying to provide a blank slate upon which you could build upon and was purposefuly avoiding specific algorithmic solutions which is probably the reason why you feel like theyre missing something. I might make some videos on a certain topic if its requested enough but why I didnt tackle videos in the way youre suggesting is purely just because there are so many variations of things you can do it would be impossible to cover them all. The closest Ive gotten to this was when I explained the code for the mods Ive made where I break down into the specifics of what each item and line does but Im willing to do some like that if it get enough requests Ill do my scouting on our chat and see if theres something folks would like to see! Thank you so much! Also if youre seeking for help with your mods or maybe youre struggling with something you can easily join our Discord chat while its not the same as the tutorials I can explain things in much greater detail as I feel like Im a better writer than I am talker plus the communication is instant! Of course this is just an invitation but I sincerely thank you for the explanation again!,themoddingofisaac,dct2f5r,1,t5_34xs3

10573395,0,t3_5rdfzf,So theres quite a few problems here honestly. The biggest one is that you need to update the stats in the cache evaluation you are trying to do so in the callback when you activate the item which isnt going to work. Because of how the cache works you shouldnt need to keep track of what the old stats were just make a variable to check if they should be added. You also shouldnt try checking for multiple cache values at once have a separate check for if it is the speed cache and one for the damage cache. If you want I could type up some pseudo code for you. I also wouldnt mind just writing the code if you want. ,themoddingofisaac,dd6k9zd,2,t5_34xs3
