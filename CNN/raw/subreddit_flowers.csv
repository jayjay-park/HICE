2907276,0,t3_2tf40l,flowering plants are known as angiosperms which includes pretty much everything except asexuals like ferns. But anyway I prefer potted plants to cut flowers home depot and walmart if you cant get to a nursery often have little window box planters or terriums with succulents or herbs besides typical flowers.. Tulips llilies poppies azaleas and lavender for example all are pretty low maintainance and will last a while in a pot.  I wouldnt recommend an orchid personally besides the fact they look like alien vaginas they also need special care and arent well suited to many climates ,flowers,cnykbml,1,t5_2r1pg
2907765,0,t3_2tf40l,What about air plants? Theyre super easy to take care of and so pretty. You can find a million different varieties and tons of people packaging them in cool vases and containers.

3833449,0,t1_cqt5pza,I cant see why it would be real. Tulips in that quantity would likely be for fresh cut flowers and those are all too close to blooming to be useful at all. If this wasnt digitally created someone lost a whole lot of money on these tulips.Sorry Im a florist. I see all those pretty tulips that no one will ever get to use. ,flowers,cqt8vw9,2,t5_2r1pg

7782786,0,t3_4lwwwl,Mine is the same except its all luxurious green.  Ive had it for a few years it looks healthy if I didnt know what it was supposed to look like.  Instead of standing up straight the vines were horizontal and long and crazy.  Nothing grew up vertically.  Ive read and read and I dont know what I have done wrong either.,flowers,d3qu6cx,1,t5_2r1pg

8406455,0,t3_4uoreu,These are beautiful. I have a few comments though not sure if theyll help any or not but just my opinions. The bromeliad one is nice..but the dirt on the bloom kinda bothers me. I wouldve preferred to see it cleaner. Its also kind of dull for a bromeliad. Perhaps something more vibrant? The close up of the yellow dahlia is very interesting but kinda hard to really tell what it is. I love the color of your Big C rose but the rose itself is a bullet. I would of loved to see it open a bit more so you can appreciate the hints of red on the petals. The one right above the Big C the open Peony flowers is probably my least favorite. Some of the flowers in the photos are extremely past their prime and it makes the whole scene look dead to me.The close up of the pink petals? in the photo below the tulips I cant really tell what it is. I wouldnt consider it floral.Would love to see a photo of open tulips also. Or perhaps try parrot tulips. The ruffles are gorgeous on those! I gotta say though that close up on the daisy your first photo WOW. Beautiful!!Overall I do love them all but those are the things that stood out most to me. I hope this helps. ,flowers,d5scp3n,2,t5_2r1pg

Flowers have become such a luxury so we deal with some of the richest and most important people in the state which can be stressful to think about sometimes. And its such a small operation that its easy to become overwhelmed by orders. Overall holy shit its amazing. Its been a wonderful experience so far and its great to have a creative outlet.
