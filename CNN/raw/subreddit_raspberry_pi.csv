34106,0,t3_1ui112,Honestly all you need is the pi SD card keyboard mouse and monitor.  A spare  to GB card from your camera is fine or a budget card can be bought new for lt anywhere.  Seriously any cheap old card will do.  Same goes for the keyboard and mouse cheapest USB ones you can buy are fine.  The monitor needs to have an HDMI or DVId connection.  If the monitor only has a VGA connection uou need an active DVIgtVGA or HDMIgtVGA  adapter which is about  on amazon.  If the adapter is DVI and doesnt come with the DVIgtHDMI part those are another  probably.If you dont already have a monitor a chrome book will probably be cheaper. No matter what the chrome book will be faster.  Without an undue amount of tinkering the chrome book wont have java support and the pi wont have flash support.,raspberry_pi,ceibbqy,2,t5_2syto

Every peripheral can draw up to . amps too. If you have a power supply that is not capable of providing as many amps as you need you might have a voltage drop since it cant supply anymore or it might get fried. I dont fully understand it but you could say that the supply determines the voltage it puts out. It doesnt put out any amps until you apply load.

833908,0,t3_23o0c0,There are a ton of other microcomputers.  RPi is one of the inexpensive ones and very easy to set up.  You are correct.  You can learn it all on your laptop.   There are pros and cons to that.One if you simply want to focus on programming  the Pi can do that better.  On your laptop youll have distractions.  The IDE will have a lot going on the OS will have a lot going on.  Until you are at a point where all that extra noise is filtered out you will be distracted.   If you want to stay on your laptop figure out the command line compile options and use the command line in full screen mode.  Get yourself into a simple environment.  The Pi just does that easier.Starting simple will let you learn how all of it works at a lower level.  The IDE will take away a lot of the grunt work which you need to understand.  Later when youre familiar with it all go back to the IDE.   Learn how all of the programming tools work somewhat by learning how they evolved.  You dont have to learn asm or C but living in the command line world will put you in the same type of mindset.Also with the Pi you can screw it all up and just flash it back.  Try doing that with your laptop.  Part of programming is trying new stuff... ultimately breaking something.  Building up a new Linux environment is skill held in higher regard than building up a Windows system.  One thing the Pi will help with is learning networking and distributed concepts.  You could simulate things on your laptop but it wont be the same as hooking up a set each running different pieces of your project and youre integrating everything.  Once you start getting used to the idea of controlling a lot of CPUs to handle different tasks in parallel instead of all being forced into one youll get hooked.And OnyxPhoenix is correct having stuff run on the tiny little black box is just cool.  Its not a bulky PC.  Its not a VM hosted on some server farm somewhere far away.  It can sit in the corner of the room powered by a USB charger and not make a sound.  A career in computers will present you with hundreds of options.  The Pi opens up some doors for you that were somewhat difficult before.  Are those needed?  Absolutely not.  You can learn and do amazing things and have a strong career on retail computers.  You really wont know what you like to do until youve done different things.  Then there is the whole zombie apocalypse thing.  Are you going to be able to run from zombies easier with a Pi or a laptop?,raspberry_pi,cgz2g0f,2,t5_2syto

Looking over the Dell monitor you linked too. Im not finding anything pointing to a Linux driver for it. That doesnt mean it can not work with it just that it doesnt work out of the box.

You have many options you can use SSH through the Terminal interface if you are on a Mac or download Putty if you are using Windows. In order to do that however you must know the IP address of the Pi. This depends on how your network is set up of course. Personally I use Nmap for this but I doubt you know what that is. You could try the manual way and ping the addresses you would think it would be perhaps checking the addresses nearby in range of your computer or phone. If you cant figure this out from here you might have to do some preliminary research on the TCPIP protocol. Edit No you cannot do this on a VM.

1680320,0,t1_cjqyjo7,First of all Im very flattered. Noob in my eyes because the only electronics experience I have is  unit of my engineering coursework  years ago and a simple code that turned an led on with my pi. Also I have never used an arduino or xbees before so I wouldnt know what I am doing. Furthermore correct me if Im wrong the system you are proposing is a  way system such that the stimulus is detected on board broadcast down to an on ground circuit calculated and then rebroadcast up to react. This is a more complex system than having the pi on board and would also be a lot slower. This probably wouldnt be very effective if the stimulus is moving towards the quad and may damage it.

A is probably good enough until you try to attach a wifi stick. Cheaper power supplies might drop the voltage andor current on increased load so yeah that means less power.

2344699,0,t1_cm1a9lx,I did enjoy them  Thank you.I agree with everything uinthepretendworld says. Use the default config files and switch out parameters as needed. Where are you trying to configure the devices from? I ask because if you configure them on your LAN they wont work remotely due to IP addresses. I see you commented out your Public IP address and your PIs IP address.The PI address needs a Public IP or at least to be accessible from the internet. This is for a Linksys but it should give you an idea.For testing purposes you might want to set it up locally get everything working on the OpenVPN side then start start dealing with your router and DMZ. Final note. Make sure your PIs security is solid turn off services that arent needed so that they arent an attack vector.

If you store media on the share that is accessible by XBMC then you need to leave the Samba if you want to grab the files from within windows explorer then you need Samba though you could use ftp here its less convenient.Samba is super convenient basically and is cross platform for the most part which is why people suggest it,raspberry_pi,cmt2s2s,1,t5_2syto

Then a normal micro USB cable between power supply and Pi. Ethernet cable or WiFi adapter. SD card for os and storage. Look for a class  card. Either keyboard and mouse or you can ssh in to the Pi just Google ssh and there are plenty of tutorials I think thats it oh a case might be good to keep the dust away.

Not sure why but the only one I have found that works is this one for onAnd off Cant figure out why but I suppose it doesnt matter now. Sure was frustrating though.

3224602,0,t1_cow34jb,But in reality no.      USB . signalling speed is Mbs. The real throughput of USB . is Mbs The Pi B and B has problems with WiFi speeds. You are lucky if you get a tenth of that Mbs. I havent heard what the WiFi speeds are for The Pi  but I have heard that they are significantly improved. Now on to the hardwired LAN side the Pi B tops out at about Mbs which blows the WiFi away. On the Pi  it maxes out the MBs builtin LAN. If you really need speed you can get a USB to Gigabit Ethernet adapter which gets around Mbs. ,raspberry_pi,cow8f70,3,t5_2syto

3984793,0,t3_362r59,.  You might be better off using XServer XSDL instead of VNC.  I find the XServer XSDL app has better input methods than most VNC apps plus the protocol is supposed to be better optimized and autoadapts to client display resolution.  RDP is also a good choice over VNC since it also autoadapts to client display resolution xrdp is the server you would want to install..  If your tablet is rooted you can dump a Debian or Raspbian rootfs on it must be in an ext or other UNIX permissions filesystem or loopback mounted image and run things from it via chroot.  If youre using a Pi  and a quadcore Nexus  youll get much better performance out of the Nexus .  Youll probably still get better performance vs. a Pi  due to clock speed differences.  Keep this in mind if youre using the setup for big compile jobs may be better to run the compile jobs on the tablet itself and copy the built files to the Pi afterwards.  Ive used my Note  as an ARM build server several times because the S .GHz CPU is multiple times as fast as even the Pi .  You can use an OTG cable with a powered hub to connect hard drives if you need more room for compile job files..  If you have XServer XSDL RDP or VNC clients on your tablet you can use the same client app for both accessing your Pi and accessing your tablets chroot possibly even simultaneously if you can find an app that lets you keep multiple sessions open.  You should have enough power to run a build on the tablet while also using it as a screen for your Pi!,raspberry_pi,crai2x4,10,t5_2syto

I was told to start working out the code to communicate between LabVIEW and the drone Which yes will most likely be a quadcopter primarily due to the requirement that we can hover  Were using a pitot tube and we need to be able to be as still as possible to measure dynamic pressure where its equal to ambient wind speed. and I thought that an Arduino would be the simplest way to do so. Im checking out those articles you linked now thanks for that! As for the payload weight were looking to keep it under  kg though depending on what has to be on board wed like to reduce that as low as  grams. We havent started designing the sensor package yet my boss wanted a proof of concept with code before anything else. As for making the drone ourselves... I hadnt honestly looked too deeply into it prior to this weekend. Id presume the fact that it would be modular would be the largest benefit. I did some quick looking and it seems like that would be the best way to tailor our desired payload to the required lift. Previously I was looking at the DJI Phantom without the camera.Thanks for the response! Sorry if this is still a bit vague were definitely still in the development phase of this project.,raspberry_pi,ct2ycb3,2,t5_2syto

4717286,0,t1_ctp3qj2,Some university networks will not allow private use of routers and can detect their presence. I suggest checking with your campus IT to make sure you can broadcast. It might be on their website whether or not they will allow a private router or you can just give them a call. I know it doesnt sound like a big deal but infrastructure WiFi is hard to setup and an unplanned signal can interfere with coverage. They can configure their access points to forge drop packets to unknown networks and then you wont be able to connect anything to it.,raspberry_pi,ctp5huy,1,t5_2syto

5454292,0,t1_cw81yzg,Not to mention thats all software and the raspberry pi is hardware. Requesting that the pi comes with that software doesnt make any sense because its dependent on what the operating system includes really when thinking about software the question should be what should the next version of raspbianarchltinsert OSgt have.I also agree with your point about storage. If the Pi had say a GB integrated flash storage device what happens if that fails or is no longer enough capacity for someones needs. Removable media is by far the better approach with a system like the Pi.The below is no longer a reply to apemanzilla I just didnt want to make multiple postsIntegrated wifi is also a bad idea then your stuck with whatever chip they decided to implement and may not be compatible with future wireless specs.Honestly the only feature Ive wanted for the Pi since day one was a RTC so they would still have mostly accurate time without depending on the internet.

However I have it backwards I have my larger laptop at home syncing to a TB HDD and I use my RPi as a laptop using the Atrix lapdock to take notes in my classes and they automatically update on my laptop at home in the event of a catastrophic SD card failure. One weakness to my build is the fact that I store my notes initially on the pis SD card but honestly if what you are planning on doing is to have the pi be the backup then this is no issue at all.That is of course if you dont mind the MBs transfer rate of USB. and having an extra power supply for that hard drive shared USBEthernet bandwidth etc.After discovering Syncthing Im seriously considering getting these two things  Odroid UX Cloudshell for XUThe XU seems so nice!  cores GB of RAM x USB. and Gigabit ethernet.

6115332,0,t3_3zbhwu,Sounds like a cool project! I remember when Linux seemed really scary it just takes time and practice.If you have a screen attached to your Pi try going into the file explorer and double clicking the .deb file. If that does not work venture into the terminal!First move into the directory or folder of your .deb file. If I downloaded one into my Downloads folder I use        cd DownloadsNote that the squiggly little tilde represents my personal folder and by default it should be accessible through the pis terminal.  is the same as pi in this case. Another tip is to use tab. The tab key can auto complete names of files and folders in Linux a really cool feature if you ask me! If you have a long file or folder name just start typing the beginning and hit tab!Next we have to tell Linux that this .deb is a package full of cool program files we want to install! This can be done with        sudo dpkg i nameofmyfile.debName of your file would be different PFinally we have to install the program. This will be done using        sudo aptget install fGood luck!,raspberry_pi,cykr0iv,7,t5_2syto

If youre drawing mA at V youll have be drawing at least mA at .V it will be higher than that because of the inefficiency of the boost regulator.The Zero didnt exist when I built mine even the A wasnt out. Im drawing around mA at V while playing a game with audio and all at V on the battery that must be at minimum mA. If Im around mA then that regulator is  efficient. Regulator efficiency tends to drop as the input voltage goes down.It actually can do better than hrmAh of battery but I like to turn mine off at .V on the battery when my warning LED comes on.,raspberry_pi,czvk10x,2,t5_2syto

6633326,0,t1_d05el0r,Cats ass is a good thing. Thats probably a Virginia saying I lived there for about  years. In the years I used a woodstove I never worried about a runaway stove. And I was using blowers into the firebox too. I dont think seasoned hardwood can exceed F. You need the catalyst to get it to go higher. Understand that my knowledge on this is not current. We used the outdoor woodstove for the last few decades until I moved out of that house so I did not have any reason to keep up with indoor woodstove technology. If youre interested the way the outdoor woodstove worked is that it was a firebox surrounded by a water jacket that held several hundred gallons. The heated water would be pumped into the house and into a coil setup that was inserted into your standard furnace on the output side of the main blower fan. When heat was needed in the house the blower would start blowing air across the coils and pushing it through the existing ductwork. At the same time the water from the stove was pumped into the coils and then recirculated back to the stove. The stove also heated your hot water.  We had a foot above ground swimming pool that I piped to the woodstove. At one point I had the water in the pool at F but it burned through wood like a forest fire.,raspberry_pi,d05fyrz,1,t5_2syto

6698484,0,t1_d0c59uy,I wanted to be able to send digital sound straight to my amplifier. The sound is great  I am not a big audiophile but using the onboard jack gave me a headache literally. You can hear a stuttering from the USBbus when using it. However HifiBerry works really well  great sound but thats goes without saying when its optic cable.Setup was an ass though. I used days trying to make it work and was close to giving up. One friday night i was drunk as you are when you are when i got home from clubbing i was really pissed that i couldnt listen to music as the onboard jack was disabled trying to make the Digi work so i tried to revert my settings to simply use the jack. and somehow i ended up fixing the Digi. i have no clue how. Drunk me was a great programmer. I use it for my MPD setup. Ive made alot of modifications to MPD and have a NAS with thousands of songs on I used to use spotify premium but Ive begun buying albums instead  My holy crusade. Ive made a HTTP server from scratch with Python  with it I can download songs from Youtube browse my libraries and much more. Its really great.Ive added Lirc which is why I need the breadboard  which means I can control my amplifier with IR... from my python server... which means I can control it with my Phone which is AWESOME! This also made it possible to make an alarm system with python  which long story short means that my amplifier turns on at  every schoolday and plays a random relaxing song picked from a playlist with ONLY relaxing songs  Waking up to Slayer is NOT that great. This is really one of my favorite things as it really improved my mornings. The project pretty much started because whenever i come home drunk i want to listen to music before falling asleep  and i was tired of having to plug in my laptop. And it kindof just evolved. Next step is integrating my TV. As a young dane many stories start with alcohol  no prejudge please!Sry for the long post haha. I guess I got carried away  hope it was worth the reads.

I would instead listen for the ringing with a mic build a Lego device that would physically pressrelease whatever mechanism the phone uses to detect whether its hung up so it would answer and then physically press the  button when instructed via a web command. In fact the mic isnt even necessary. You could use a web command to lift the phone and then press the button after a short delay all in one command.So to use you would open the page on your phone use the intercom in your lobby to page your apt press the button on your phone and simply wait for the command to reach the Pi and execute. I would ask why you want your Pi to page you with a buzz notification OR do that part as version .Obviously the devil is in the details but I would go the lowtech Lego route instead of a USB modem and the complexity that would bring.What does the intercom phone look like in your apartment?,raspberry_pi,d109uah,1,t5_2syto

7347086,0,t3_4fy0wh,I had a Pi B and it was slow a little over  MBs. But the Pi B had much better IO performance than the Pi B. Three recommendations        Dont use WiFi if at all possible. Hardwired LAN is much faster.      Format the disk as ext or maybe ext. On the Pi B NTFS was about  slower that ext on reads. The Pi  has enough CPU horsepower so NTFS was less than  slower than ext.       If you are not going to be using the Pi B for anything else except a NAS then consider a stripped down OS. Look at a Raspbian Lite or DietPi or maybe ARCH. I used an old version of Volumio for a while on the Pi B. The new version now has NAS and DLNA servers built in.

Ive had that when Ive lost network connections and when I typed in the wrong password.  It could also be something misconfigured in Samba.  But most often the problem is permissions. Do a df to find out where your hard drive is. Look in smb.conf to find what directory Samba is mounting.      Then do a ls l of that mount point directory.  Also do a ls l of the directory before it like ls l mnt. You should see something like drwxrwxrwx. That means that it is a directory and that it has read and write and execute permissions for your user your group and everyone else If it not set to drwxrwxrwx then do a sudo chmod  mntUSB or whatever directory you are at. Then go to the next directory in and do the same.    Then reboot or restart Samba. Let me know how it goes. ,raspberry_pi,d2dinu9,2,t5_2syto

I also have a TV that doesnt decide what mode the video is quick enough to catch it.The weird part booting the pi is that its actually the gpu that handles the boot.  So the gpu wakes up tastes the rainbow and then starts pulling the next stage off the SD card.  So if theres a problem at that stage no card card is shafted image wasnt written correctly etc it tastes the rainbow and then nothing else happens.  This doesnt actually mean the rainbows a bad thing.  Its the absence of the next step thats actually the problem.  eg its not what you see  its what you dont see,raspberry_pi,d3oxm7n,2,t5_2syto

8308623,0,t3_4tbwrt,tldr  No.Any LCD screen needs a controller board to accept video input.A laptop motherboard has the LCD controller built in. Most little GPIO screens you see for the Pi are either attached to the controller board or have a separate controller board on a ribbon cable.So you could use a laptop LCD if you reverse engineer the screen and build your own controller board. This is extremely difficult and would require a lot of lowlevel hardware and software knowledge. If it was easy vendors would already be selling controller boards which do it.,raspberry_pi,d5g4ukz,5,t5_2syto

8341343,0,t1_d5k77mg,Thanks for your reply! I appreciate it greatly!! Actually it turns out I have already reserve engineered all of that!! I was going to make a full fledged remote control app for iOS devices. I already have a tweak that hooks into the MediaRemote framework! So that part is already done In my app I also have a server that can connect to the client iOS device itself. In current stages the client can manipulate playback get information about now playing etc. playlists up next stuff like that still needs to be done.  The server in current stages can register to the device but I havent started sending information over the network yet. Some inthemoment thoughts to how this could work I could continue reserve engineering amp turn the Pi into a client. Might be difficult due to login. Or I could asynchronously transmit playback similar to AirPlay from the iOS device itself amp stream it to the Pi. I dislike AirPlay because it cuts out often laggy amp not the best quality.Whatre your thoughts?I definitely understand what you mean by interoperability. Im invested in Apple which makes many things wonderful inside their walled garden. So when I have things like this I take it as a challenge to do it myself .

If you use a cheapo Walmart power block and cable pi  wont be happy most likely thats another  or so and if you order a cheap SD thats another  or so. Already at  for a  or  for a  plus the controller. For a console type unit a cheap controller is about .. For a portable you can use gpio and your own buttons but the buttons will cost something.. Or a donor piece will cost something.. So already to  havent accounted for shipping on anything yet.. and havent even thought about a case. You can have one D printed you can buy a game boy or something but thats all additional costs..Then as you are following the tutorial you got a moment where you think well if I just do THIS... I can make that way nicer!! Then each one of those moments adds ..Mine is a console not a portable. I built a custom aluminum case that I had powder coated then multiple laser cut plexi panels with multicolor LED illumination.. As I said it doesnt HAVE to get super expensive just depends how carried away you get.Edit just realized another cost I left out.. If you are doing a portable you will need a battery and charging circuit as well.. Havent looked into it myself but its not free!

9444185,0,t1_d9d1cn4,I installed the latest Raspbian Jessie lite. Keep in mind the lite version is very minimal. It is bare bones and doesnt include much including X which pyqt relies on to an extent. I had to manually install Python and some supporting packages and I had to install xutils and xinit packages. In the end it was still far less than a standard Jessie install. Im not sure what your end goal is but mine auto loads into the custom gui and includes usage of the frame buffer to send video to my tft ic serial to the touchscreen and an adc SPI for video to the screen browsing loading and saving to the filesystem video output to the HDMI without effecting the tft and audio via pwm and a filter circuit. This is all on a pi zero and with minimal tweaking beyond the base image install. If you need it I can try to look through my change log to see exactly what was needed but it was pretty simple.

9519213,0,t3_5b6vo4,Hi!  I use cheap hobbyking digital servos for a clock but any should work as long as you power them properly.  Hopefully this code is a helpful example for you to learn off of note the first line is a commandHere is what my clock looks like with Servo A displaying hour and Servo B displaying minuteBehind the cardboard I have a A v adapter and Im powering both the pi and servos from that.  The signal wires of the servos go straight to GPIO.  If you use separate power sources for your PI and Servos you need to have a common ground for the signal go actually go to the servos.  You can run a servo maybe two right off the pis v pin as long as the draw isnt too high otherwise the pi will reboot when you try to actuate them.I would be happy to answer any questions!,raspberry_pi,d9mg22r,2,t5_2syto

Also try pushing just one pin. As soon as you can feel it getting loose and sliding in go to the next one. Keep doing this until you have moved all pins. Either you find the blocking one or it works.

The actual length of the pulse seems to be most significant to an average ESC.  So assuming you have it set for  Hz youll want to set your duty cycle to  power the ESC wait for it to acknowledge and idle the beep every  sec set duty cycle to  wait for it to acknowledge usually two or three quick beeps then back to  one long beep to indicate armed then control as normal.The indicators beepslights are not standardized but a common convention is used for almost everything.

You can run whatever applications at same time that you want.  Simply by starting it up.

10811773,0,t3_5ulwz2,See here for a basic white paper of the standard that gives you an overview of the tech. Its built on the USB OnTheGo standard which is designed for mobile devices. Luckily for us the Pi runs on a mobile processor that supports this. No processing happens to the sound on the source side instead all the amplification happens in your car. Problem is the Pi doesnt natively support USB Host communication which is what is needed for sending audio to your car. The Pi Zero natively supports it though so that would absolutely work. Theoretically the Model A could but would require modifying the board as the pin that activates what you want is tied to ground internally. If you could get it working though it does solve the problem of video getting out of sync since the USB audio out automatically synchronizes itself. ,raspberry_pi,ddv5p7u,3,t5_2syto

11182234,0,t1_dez8qds,Having partial support for it on a local system is nowhere near being integrated into the streaming system like it is with Steam InHome Streaming. Assuming it even works well streamed from the Pi through that Python driver youd have to switch applications in order to access configurations rather than having full access to all of its settings from within Steams overlay. And you wouldnt have access to the mountain of ranked community configurations so youd need to start from scratch every time with one of a few default profiles.So sure if you count partial support thats inconvenient to use and is not actually integrated within the streaming program then sure.,raspberry_pi,dezhryr,-2,t5_2syto

My first thoughts are that it looks a bit sketchy having those relays exposed the way they do assuming youre powering everything from v.My next thoughts are strictly on the hydroaquaponic configuration.    I think youl benefit greatly by adding a fan to circulate air expose more CO over surface of the plants over the plants the tank should really be optically isolated from the light.  Youre gonna have an algae bloom which will outcompete your plants for the nutrients created by your fish.  Not to mention temps should remain relatively cool.  not much warmer than  degrees F  You should pick animal species that are okay with these temps. You really need to monitor pH.  Not only for the plants sake but the critters too. The tank water should be aerated.  I assume your pump is on a timer.  It should probably run continuously andor add an airstone to the tank portion to mix oxygen into the solution.   This will help prevent root rot on the plants roots.

11756129,0,t3_67qpmq,Couple ideas for you  Theres a Pyle  channel amp with a usb charger on it looks like it does a lot of extra stuff.    Pyle    Lepai You may want to consider a wall splitter that does USB power  Regular outlet.  Its probably going to be the cheapest option.    Belkin Splitter,raspberry_pi,dgsl4vg,3,t5_2syto
11757016,0,t1_dgso7wb,So just having  and  and  the port listed in my config open I dont get any connections in the torrent client. Also because I have killed other traffic my Conky line giving me my external IP doesnt work either. Im working on it though. ,raspberry_pi,dgsorez,4,t5_2syto
11759407,0,t1_dgsxlbo,So........yeah. That VLAN has several other allow rules before the deny all rule. These rules are being applied to the Pi so about fifteen ports are open to the pi including the basic web ports. Overall thats not a bad thing because Ill still need access to download updates and whatnot. Ive been watching and while the tunnel is down no torrent activity happens and my logs blow up with denied packets. Its not perfect but I think it will work.,raspberry_pi,dgsyip9,1,t5_2syto
