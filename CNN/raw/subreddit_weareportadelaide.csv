8000021,0,t1_d4f2yxh,I think losing Richardson and Walsh really hurt us in the coaching box we havent looked that solid since they left but at least Hinkley seems to have finally accepted that the gameplan wasnt working and has made positive changes in the last month or so. Agree too many of our top players go missing itd be generous to Boaks form to say that he looks like he might be playing hurt. Disagree on Gray though I think hes one of the very best players in the entire league. Hartlett and Westhoff both need to sort out the inconstancy Hartletts kicking especially seems to be either woeful or beautiful without inbetween.  ,weareportadelaide,d4fa19e,1,t5_2x1a0
8993088,0,t3_53fqqe,A great appointment it really is!Im not really bothered by the  year contract TBH but it is important to treat coaching contracts different to players. Players have a limited time frame  years in to make an impact but coaches can be involved  times as long... so it is unfair to group coaching contracts with players like Lobbe and Hartlett ps  we were spooked into these by FA uncertainty. Not many coaches have an instant impact at a club. It takes time for coaches to establish relationships within the coaching group with players and to instil a gameplan. The  most recently successful teams Hawthorn Geelong and Swans took years along with legups of shitness to build.Back to Lade.It is obvious weve been crying out for a dedicated ruck coach. Lade is probably the best actual ruckman of the last  years. Sure Sandilands had the absolute height to dominate Cox the around the ground workrate and Nic Nat the amazing leap however for stoppage hitout smarts Lade outshines them all. Even though he shared ruck duties with Brogan often it was his ruck work that allowed our midfield to dominate clearances from  to .A lot is mentioned about the loss of Richardson and Walsh but people forget we also lost Shaun Rehn our choice. Rehn was our ruckmidfield coach from  when we were forced to move him on to accommodate Walsh this was while we still had Richardson too. Is it a coincidence that Lobbes form was on the up in ? Sure Rehn left in  but his teaching were still fresh and Walsh was experienced enough to continue Lobbes form. Once Walsh left with an apprentice midfield coach Voss more in a sec and without a dedicated ruck coach Lobbes form went to shit in  and .Lade is a huge upgrade on Greaves a VFL ruckman. With him working alongside Voss I am excited about our midfield future. Voss is harshly treated IMO. He was shoehorned prematurely into the Head Coaching position at the shitty Lions as a favourite son saviour and was doing OKish before outsted on the belief they would land Paul Roos. He then rebooted his coaching career the right way by accepting an assistant position with us to learn the caper. Voss has amazing midfield knowledge and I believe our mids arewill benefit but he isnt a ruck coach. Lade will fill that void.Now we just need to find a solution to our forward line.,weareportadelaide,d7stw49,8,t5_2x1a0
