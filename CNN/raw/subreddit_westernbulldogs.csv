1794813,0,t1_ck5d43b,Are you questioning McCartney? Because Im questioning McCartney. I like the dude and he can clearly draft but the numbers arent screaming positive vibes.  wins  losses. Were improving but what if hes just not a good game day coach? What if we could be doing a lot better with the talent we have? This side isnt out of the question to break into the top  next season. Were not full of awful players. That said if we get rid of him whats the say were not going the way of Melbourne. Coaches bring gameplans that can take seasons to get used to. It may be a knee jerk reaction but at the same time under the wrong coach we could go absolutely nowhere. Next season will be incredibly telling. Im expecting so much more and the pressure is on McCartney wholeheartedly. ,westernbulldogs,ck5dvwe,1,t5_2wbml

3701448,0,t3_32sdgc,Some thoughts   Mother. Fucking. Ayce. CORDY!!!  What is that feckless lanky fuck doing there? He as about as useful as an ashtray on a surfboard! Give Redpath or Campbell some game time in the firsts.   Good luck to Lukas Webb on debut! Ive kept my eye on the new draftees amp hes the only one whos body looks truly AFL ready. Even when they were drafted I thought hed be the first to debut.      Geez Easton Wood is stiff no pun intended. Plays IMO the best game of his career signs a  year deal then does a hammy at training! Word is it will only be  week but hes done them both before so  could easily lead to  or . He leaves a bit of a whole in the backline. I dont think Lukas Webbs a likeforlike swap  hes more of a bull amp lacks some of Eastons swiftness. Going to have to be another big day for Boydy or JJ will have to really step up. Fingers crossed.    We look very midfield heavy this week what with Macrae Wallis amp Dahlhaus all being named as forwards even though theyll spend most of the game in the middle. That may spell another week on the sidelines for Hrovat amp Stevens.   Also good to see Fletcher Roberts get another go. Hes never looked particularly natural but he showed a lot last year in the VFL particularly but also in a few AFL games. I personally have been singing Joel Hamlings praises but Roberts probably deserves another chance as a long term Dog.   Im going to put my neck on the line amp say Michael Talia could hold Jarryd Roughead. He was really great last week troubled Jack Riewoldt amp kept other forwards well out of the contest. Even if Rough kicks  or  that could probably be counted as a win to Talia.   Best of luck Dogs. I dont foresee a win but I think we can avoid a blowout amp hit Hawthorn while their vulnerable.

4069488,0,t1_crk5648,Well I guess we will see.  Edit Actually I think youre right. I rewatched the footage a few times and even though there was clearly nothing in it it did seem like it was done out of frustrationanger which I believe will be taken into account. Most likely gonna get weeks.,westernbulldogs,crk5e6p,1,t5_2wbml
4769506,0,t3_3g7yb0,  Wallis.  His clearance work is just so important. He is an absolute force and he drives the team.    Easton Wood.  Such an incredibly valuable player. His intercept marking is obviously amazing but hes far from a onetrick pony.    The Bont.  Best game Ive seen from him probably this year. He was overhyped at the start of the year and I think everyone forgets hes only . Now its a complete reversal and I think hes a bit underrated currently which probably suits him anyway.,westernbulldogs,ctvqmpt,1,t5_2wbml

5701384,0,t3_3szz2g,FocusI think our focus should be on. key defenders. key forwards. ruck. outside speed. half back flank. small forwardBut I dont think we should reach too far for needs except maybe for defenders with our last two picks if we dont get any at . We really need key defenders. We could maybe reach for a ruck with pick  as well.,westernbulldogs,cx3t8ov,2,t5_2wbml
6971936,0,t1_d16l2ak,Gotta agree with Wildly on Macrae. His DE in NAB and NAB were  and . I definitely think he has improved.,westernbulldogs,d16lu1y,3,t5_2wbml
6981825,0,t1_d17pbre,I disagree Sandilands is critical to their side. Clarke amp Griffin Im not sure which one will play have seldom had to ruck a whole game in recent seasons amp when they have they havent been anything to write home about.  When we played last year Sandilands had  hitouts amp Fyfe Neale amp Mundy had  clearances together. We werent smashed in the overall clearance count but they had  more inside s than us which means they made the most of theirs amp we didnt.  Clearances will be crucial without a ruckman as good as Sandi I think our midfielders can really take it to theirs in that department. I honestly think Campbell with help from Toyd or Roughy could run rings around Clarke or Griffin.,westernbulldogs,d17q8xz,1,t5_2wbml

7379891,0,t3_4gf0s4,Im in Chicago.  I downloaded the Western Bulldogs app it reminds me when games are about to start.  It helps with the time change.  Usually Ill still have to watch a replay of it and you can do that on the afl.com.au after a few days.  Theres a guy i think afldude who streams most of the games and puts it on here.  The quality hasnt been what Im used to in US for other games NFL NHL NBA etc... but its enough to stream it to my TV using chromecast and its watchable. The toughest thing is the time change to be honest.  I think I was able to watch  games so far this year and one of them I was up till  AM watching.Also my condolences for being a browns fan...,westernbulldogs,d2h1jz0,2,t5_2wbml

11744238,0,t3_67kx8v,Score Weekly Rank Overall Rank  My total score lifted a little compared to last week but Im still not happy with the team. Also lost the league game by just  points which puts me at .NEGATIVES The backline wasnt as good this week with Adams  and Lloyd  producing below average scores. Bont  unfortunately couldnt keep up his run of high scores. Midfield rookies scored pretty poorly this week with SPP  Parfitt  and Bowes . Franklin  was again below average. Roughead  has forced my hand and Ill have to trade him this week before he loses more value.POSITIVES Laird  was back to his best. Otten  is proving very valuable with three great scores in a row. Treloar  has finally posted a big score. Nankilands   is doing much better than I initially thought. Dahlhaus  and Macrae  have been two of the best forwards so far.TRADES Roughead has to go but theres very few options that dont seem like a waste of cash. Fisher for Carlton has looked okay in his first two games with scores of  and . Might look to trade out Barrett or Hibberd for him depending on their selections.,westernbulldogs,dgr8mcl,1,t5_2wbml
