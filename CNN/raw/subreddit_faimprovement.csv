978797,0,t1_chdfnk3,Hello pyang When I read the first part of your reply I felt quite defensive. What do you mean what are you ashamed of. People come here to be helpful and then try to tell you its no big deal why are you upset about that. So your alone be happy with yourself. It isnt a matter of being jealous of someone who got to drive a Ferrari and we are not comparing sexual conquests. No the shame is for the failing in the basic human relations. The story was about the maturity of his  year old daughters relationship. That simply pointed to my failure. It is a major part of life and I missed it. Emotional loneliness is hard. Defining the shame took a while in my head. Im not sure what Im going to do with it but Ive identified it.I admit when I read your advise to talk to my partner about how that conversation made me feel and to let him know I care and am interested in his family I thought he knows that. We have always talked about them. If his kids knew the details of their growing up we talked about they would be horrified. But I dont want that relationship damaged and I figured it couldnt hurt to bring it up. So I did I apologized if I made him uncomfortable. He said no it was fine he understood. that was followed by an update of their current activities. It seems I may have put a bigger stop sign up than I realized. Thank you for that. He is my most important relationship.For me Im trying to restore some purpose or reason in my life. I have made a fair amount of changes enough that people have asked if everything is ok. My partner says Im having a mid life crisis. Ive thanked him for the optimistic outlook on my life span. My mother is worried but she is always looking for some drama. I am concerned that I have lost passion for doing things for my fun. An example is one of my personal cars I had started to redo because I decided I would sell it and get a new toy. One of my customers wants to buy it. I just have been lazy in getting it done. I still do body work during the day and even finished up the body on one of my partners personal projects. I just feel less interest in mine.I am however continuing to try things. Im sticking with the attention to my appearance. I am being friendly and more social and I am trying to expand my circles. I no longer talk at people but I really try to have a conversation. In some ways I am more relaxed than I have been in years. The things Im thinking about are more personal and real. Its much quieter in my house I dont need constant noise. I think thats enough for now Thanks   ,faimprovement,chfjq4g,1,t5_2tav6

2362209,0,t1_cm3mo16,Totally. And guys who push with women arent really good at it. They succeed more than we do but only because if you talk to a hundred women one of them is bound to be interested. They push too much and turn a lot of women off. We never push and then surprise! nothing happens. For the guys who are REALLY good with women the girls chase them. They know when to push and when to pull. They move easily between those two states. Thats my goal. I am not good at it yet. ,faimprovement,cm3ogyu,1,t5_2tav6
2585395,0,t1_cmvrboi,I disagree. It wasnt amazing but peoples first time rarely is. Sex is actually a pretty weird experience and it doesnt stop being weird until youve done it a few times and gotten used to it. This is generally what its like for me especially with a new girlSo like I just put my thing in here? Wait it wont go in. Hold on I cant find the hole. Help me out. Oh there it is thanks. So I just sort of go in and out? How fast should I be doing that? Ok so I guess this is ok. Man this is really tiring. That farting sound of our skin slapping together is really distracting. Maybe I can adjust a bit so that goes away. Ok keep going keep going keep going man jesus man this is some serious cardio. Woooo I cant do that anymore. Do you want to get on top? Ok so I pull out and wait for you to get into position here you are let me pass you my dick there. No worries. Alright lets see if we can hit a good rhythm here. Thrust thrust thrust thrust oh damn were falling out of sync and now were just going up and down together. Ill slow down a bit there we go. Thrust thrust thrust thrust damn it popped out. There we go now its back in. Youre tired? No worries we can switch. Actually lets just kiss a while until I get my woody back. Want me to go down on you? OK. Wow that tastes weird. And just a little tangy. I dont know how I feel about this fluid in my mouth and I have no idea what Im supposed to be doing or where. Is it working? I cant tell. Shes making noises and moving around but maybe shes just acting to make me feel better. This is a really uncomfortable position to be in. You know what? Lets just jerk ourselves off....I may have gotten a little carried away there. Humorous descriptions aside sex is indeed a strange and awkward experience until you get used to it. When it all stops being so surprising and you stop thinking about everything and focus on your own arousal it gets much better and you can start really enjoying it but that takes practice and a partner you really feel comfortable with. ,faimprovement,cmw1rs3,7,t5_2tav6

2728206,0,t3_2qn78a,Usually friends are made through work class proximity neighbors or shared interests. It is possible to make friends just by approaching people in the street but its not likely. With all due respect Id say if youre posting on this subreddit dont try because you do not currently have the skills to pull it off. Where should you focus your efforts? Well youre in college so start there. Join clubs that A you are interested in and B have girls in them. If you want to join your colleges LoL club thats great but realize that the friends you are going to be mostly male and you wont be getting texts at pm Hey man pregame at my house then were hitting up some parties. Look into stuff like music groups coed sports student government and volunteer orgs. Im trying not to hate on gamers but there are more girls in the other groups and the guys in general are more outgoing. Join a few clubs try to be friendly and meet people and if you feel like you completely embarrassed yourself somehow just switch clubs. Over time you will build up some social skills that you can eventually take onto the street.If making friends were working out approaching strangers on the street would be a marathon while joining some student organization would be running a K.,faimprovement,cne6ow2,1,t5_2tav6

5218557,0,t3_3meuq9,Its okay to talk to strangers in public places. It all depends on your intentions. If you target a hot girl and talk to her in order to get a date thats going to come off as creepy. If you are friendly to people you encounter and talk to all humans equally thats okay. Sometimes they will be attractive girls and a conversation will progress. Work on talking to people in general this is how people get dates with strangers. You can meet people at any festive location. With cafes or stores people are there on a specific errand. Concerts bars festivals etc. people are there just to have fun and be social. They will be a lot more receptive.Try making friends. Its easier to make friends. Friends introduce you to their friends who you can get to know socially in order to ask them out.,faimprovement,cvf114q,1,t5_2tav6

I probably shouldnt have called law enforcement as much as I did but it was moreso to cover my bases. Even if I shouldnt have got the law enforcement involved as much as I did at least I reported it enough times that I covered my bases if things got worse luckily they didnt. Plus what if she actually did harm herself physically and I didnt do anything about it? When she swung at me there were witnesses some of them being members of faculty and they elevated it to campus security and campus security ended up calling the police on my behalf.  ,faimprovement,d0rpms6,1,t5_2tav6

So I fucking apologize in advance for the wall of counterexamples that are coming. Because looks are absolutely unquestionably important but theyre also more fluid and less important than we tend to think. First because the way you dress and talk and move all tie into how attractive you are. Even women who get judged on their looks more than we do can be drastically more attractive just by moving or talking in a certain way. I remember a friend once saying to me Its not that shes hot. Its that when I look at her I think of sex. He had a way with words. And that fluidity is even more effective for men. Women are attracted to all sorts of random features. Like a mans hands. Or calves. Some women like a big man because it makes him look powerful. Some women like a thin man because I dont know why me. Some women just like the way your body shape fits in relation to hers. I remember reading a woman say that she didnt understand at all why women were attracted to Benedict Cumberbatch until she heard his voice. So looks especially for women really dont boil down to a number system. So are you really a ? Im not saying you arent just that to be a  I think youd have to be actually deformed in some way. Even then you can still be very attractive. I remember a guy I couchsurfed with once who was actually deformed. His head was shaped a bit like a chameleons. But he played a lot of soccer and was in really good shape. And he always had people over at his house. He was a very cool social guy. Everyone liked him and a lot of women found him attractive. I feel like I might be describing exactly the same thing that youre talking about so Ill stop there. I guess I think you already have a great handle on it. I admire your attitude.
