3237851,0,t3_2x5p34,This may be a stretch but if the trip to Portugal is a success as far as gelling goes I think we stand a moderately OK chance this season. Better than when we were eclipsed by the shadow on a monumental cheeseburger. ,TampaBayRowdies,coxlz6a,3,t5_2w6i0

11068004,0,t3_5xzr89,Romano is a tad goofy in his analysis is saying Tampa Bay wont support their sports franchises....Having lived in TB since  Ive discovered the fans are getting smarter and smarter.  IFWhen the professional sports teams commit to winning and doing things the right way the fans will show up in major fashion ie Lightning amp Bucs. The Lightning is the best run pro franchise in the country per ESPN.  They are committed to winning and doing things first class.  The Bucs went the cheap way after firing Gruden and they paid dearly both in in wins and fan support.  The Rays flat out arent committed to winning so they will continue to only draw the die hards.  Orlando Magic while not local they are a nice ownership group but not committed to winning thus their arena is consistently half empty.  Edwards has done nothing but show a commitment to winning.  Time will tell obviously.  One thing is for sure the MLS is growing and the demand for a team is high.  Garber is no dummy.  Time will tell...,TampaBayRowdies,demjq9f,4,t5_2w6i0
11072637,0,t1_demykex,Im really not sure how you can say this year shows they arent the best run franchise. They had a bunch of injuries and still have a chance to make the playoffs on top of it. Yzerman has made some moves for the team that are fantastic while fielding a competitive team and ensuring the team is stable. The best run franchise has more to it than wins and losses and sometimes I think people would do well to remember it. When you have a stable franchise without a lot of coachmanagement turnover and an owner who is willing to do whatever he can for the team that is a successful franchise. One season where we are still fighting for a playoff spot even with a ton of injuries doesnt negate that.,TampaBayRowdies,den2n70,6,t5_2w6i0

11697073,0,t1_dglva8q,lol ... That pic is great but not quite what I had in mind! I havent kept up with the Tottenham stadium situation but looking at the picture I guess they will have to tear down White Hart Lane at some point and play in the half constructed new stadium while the rest of it is completed. I was thinking more of the old style four stand british soccer stadium where they tear down one of the four old stands and rebuild it while continuing to use the other three. ,TampaBayRowdies,dglvr2t,1,t5_2w6i0
