1097419,0,t1_chsw51v,I think you make some excellent points but I think its a mistake to avoid using a promising or in this case proven effective technology solely because it has the potential to become less effective in time. In the real world no technology can be perfect.  Also I disagree with your all of our eggs in one basket assertion. No one with any sense is suggesting that we embrace one specific avenue of GMO cropping and cease all research and practice of all other types of food production. GMO research is an extremely broad technology which is one of the main reasons it makes no sense to be antiGMO. Thats a bit like claiming that one is antichemistry or antimedicine.In an open adaptive system with essentially infinite variables and no end of growth in sight its not possible to create a food production method that doesnt experience increasingly complex challenges as time goes on. This is not a reason to stop researching quite the contrary. Its a powerful argument for continuing research and new developments in food production.,Knoxville,cht14hb,1,t5_2qi32

1738236,0,t3_2eac5d,OEF vetUT studentFather here. I personally live in Oak Ridge. It hits all of your marks except the commute. Oak Ridge has the best schools in the area including our very own Rhodes Scholar last year. You will also be able to find a much nicer house for the price range you are talking about then anywhere in Knoxville. Oak Ridge is also a great place for kids that age as the city has invested a lot of money in its city obviously parks. As for the commute. I drive about  minutes to school Oak Ridge takes about  minutes to drive across so nowhere in Oak Ridge will be more then  minutes away. When I first got out I was used to the base and was so not interested in a long drive. Once I started doing it though I found I really enjoyed having the commute. Because that half hour to and from school is my time. I dont have to worry about homework or projects or mowing the lawn or the kids or anything but driving and listening to the radio.People on this sub will be quick to point out that Oak Ridge does not have a night life but it does have convenient shopping centers great parks good schools and low crime rates.,Knoxville,cjy9ole,1,t5_2qi32

Basically what I think is happening is that for some reason the tonearm thinks its hit the end of the record.  The little brake mechanism for lack of a better term the triggers the return of the arm is stuck out of place causing a premature autoreturn.  You will have to open it up and see how it works.  It could be as simple as adding some grease putting back in place or you could potentially remove it to eliminate the autoreturn function all together.

Several times they have billed me for things incorrectly. Billed me for a modem rental. I owned my own and was renting nothing. At one point gave me one of those digital boxes and I gave it back to them when I cancelled my cable. They called me to return it afterwards and I told them I gave it back several weeks ago. Months later some collections department called asking for the equipment. Again... I told them I dont have it. I moved addresses and in the process they screwed up the bandwidth meter on my account page and I could not see how much bandwidth I had left. After getting the bandwidth meter fixed they messed up my internet speed in the process lowering it by about mbps. That took a while to sort out the whole bandwidth meter thing and then get my internet speed fixed.

If it decided to charge them even if it was just playing do you think they would be able to get up from a sitting position that fast?  Could you?  Dont bet on it.As for taking pictures of tourists I actually was there to accompany my outoftown guest.  But if I see anyone doing something they shouldnt do and I can take a picture I do.  Why?  Because if God forbid something happens and someone gets hurt there is photographic evidence of what happened.  The federal government is a frequent target by litigious visitors of national parks who sue due to injuries or deaths.  More often than not the person was acting negligently  like here  but will claim they were just standing there.  I am not saying these people would do that but it could happen.  Of course had something happened the chances are almost certain that bull would be euthanized even though he was just being an elk.gtWhat if I told you you were a tourist too?And?  Fine I am a tourist but one who takes the necessary precautions.  Actually I enter the Smokies with the mindset that I am there as a guest of the elks and bears and rattlesnakes and other critters for whom the park is home.  Which means its my responsibility to act accordingly not the other way around.I like tourists.  Tourists come to this area and spend money.  Tourists support the local economy.

The food art and music scenes are growing daily seemingly. I will say the only complaint I know of for Chattanooga in comparison is that Knoxville is much more of a walkable city IMO if you live near downtown or campus.

Why shouldnt professors like Rob Heller Jewish or Abhijit Mazumdar Hindu be able to attend an office party that their employer is paying for? Again I think youre overthinking this. There were two incidents which Jimmy Duncan latched onto to secure a spot in his next reelection. This controversy is just political pandering.

7949406,0,t1_d49fnwj,I dont disagree with running away.  That is a prudent course of action.  But from what I am reading people didnt.  And when trapped still chose no action.I shouldnt say all though.  I did read an article where one of the drag queenbartenders who survived was hiding with others in a dressing room and he talked about how he stood by the door at the ready with a chair in his hands figuring if the shooter came through the door he would try to repel him with that.  Let me ask you this  if youre in a situation where there is an active shooter and flight is not an option what would you do?  I dont think it is an issue of heroics.  If I can hide great but if it seems that is not going to work then I would like to think I would react in a manner where I can preserve my life and others.  And if I go down fighting so be it.  No one has time to get a heroic plan together in that situation but I am afraid it has become the norm to give up and wait for death hoping it doesnt come.  I am afraid that we  society in general  have allowed ourselves to depend less on ourselves and more on someone. And I never mentioned firearms so I dont know why you brought up the nd Amendment.  Youre right this is not a nd Amendment issue nor is it really an issue about guns in general.  Evil will find a way  guns explosives box cutters whatever.

8766009,0,t3_50546o,I think there is a market. Youve got Suttrees with the full on barcade on Gay St its all arcade machines so wouldnt compete with video gamers.Then youve got the Yacht Club off the strip where they have a tiny space with one TV set up for classic video games. This is more of a bar where you can chill with a couple friends and play SNES.This would be a difficult market to pin down and would require a LOT more market research than a thread on Reddit can give you.I disagree with nearly everyone else in this thread that your target would be minors. I think the adult crowd would be the most likely to come. And I do think drinks and food would help but that shouldnt be the primary focus.

Is it risky to clip your toe nails by firing a gun at them? Is it risky to fall asleep behind the wheel of a car? Is it risky to climb  feet on a crane where any given gust of wind or slip of the handfoot could result falling to your death? I dont do any of these things and I know that they are all dangerous.

Mine always finds mud no matter where we go. It also has a nice loop for the humans to walk while the dogs play. There is also a swimming section that is attached to the lake with a dock they can jump off of. Personally I dont care for Victor Ashe. I find it dirty and lots of piles of poop that people do not pick up. I do recommend Tommy Schumpert park. Like the other post we have had no issues with the water.

11477969,0,t3_63tf2k,Moved to knox about .yrs ago from Chicago. The only thing Ive found to be lacking in Knox compared to Chicago is Portillos and actual Chicago style food in general  which ive resorted to making myself now works out well  and no beaches. Despite the lack of Chicago style food the overall foodrestaurant selection is quite good and constantly expanding. The weather here is infinitely better winters have been extremely mild so far. Summers it seems pretty similar to Chicago. There is traffic usually only when there is an accident of sorts but no where near like Chicago rush hour. Public transit does seem lackluster here  no metrasubway there are busses have not used. Uber is usually readily available though. Road construction and construction in general is minimal compared to Chicago. Most of the roads in Knox are infinitely nicersmoother. Cost of living is dirt cheap and you have the smokies less than an hour away with all kinds of hikes and camping. If you motorcycle Chicago cant even come close  tail of the dragon cherohala skyway foothills parkway are some amazing rides  and you can almost get away with riding year round.Internet I have comcast mo for mbps down up TB cap. The biggest negative is before I moved to knox I did not have allergies of any kind. Now come spring time it is like clockwork and I end up with terrible headachemigraines from sinus issues by end of May. Hopefully the suggested mucinex will resolve the issue this year.,Knoxville,dfx0vf0,3,t5_2qi32

Some of the popular places to hike into are North River and Rattlesnake Rock. Just park the car and go haha youll hit a campsite eventually or can make your own by the creeks,Knoxville,dg9s0yy,1,t5_2qi32

I called their support and all they could tell me at the time was that an outage was reported and that techs were en route. Usually theyre pretty solid though. ,Knoxville,dgq9qxj,1,t5_2qi32
