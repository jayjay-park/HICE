284101,0,t1_cfa0diq,Yes she was trying to complete the mission like May or Ward or Coulson would. The problem is that she doesnt have the same training they do. That is my main point rushing into a situation for which you are unprepared just ends up overextending the team when they get there. Yeah she didnt know for sure the team was coming but they had the tracker and the means to disable the cars. She and Fitz could have disabled all the cars and at least sat tight until it looked like Quinn was leaving before engaging. Or they could have placed the tracker on Quinns car or guard and regrouped to find him later with backup.I definitely dont think she should have brought in Fitz. I just have no idea what she was hoping to accomplish. She was actually planning on going in unarmed until Fitz made her take the nightnight gun. I am not saying it wasnt brave but it wasnt the right call. She took an unnecessary risk because it was personal to her.

744531,0,t1_cgondro,gt I dont think Ward has turned evil but Ill play along.I agree. What I took from his final scene while Garrett was bathering on in the background was a sincere look of remorse that he killed the innocent agents in order to convince Garrett that he was on his side.

Explains why Garret didnt seem to know hes never met the clairvoyent Explains why Deathlok took off and didnt engage them. When the Clairvoyent said to Deahlok its time we meet he could have very well meant when they met before finding Nash. Explains why Ward gave the speech to Trip then did the opposite.

755755,0,t1_cgq6gdf,Possible but from a writing stand point that probably make it just one step too complex and unnecessary and would lose the audience. Ward being the clairvoyant is the ultimate gotcha and honestly at this point if its not Ward wont you be disappointed? Also we know they are going to the fridge previews showed them there and stealing the tech that is stored there. Makes a LOT of sense at this point for Ward to separate himself from SHIELD since hes under high suspicion anyway and now SHIELD is basically in shambles as they are no longer of any real value to him. What would make sense is to go steal all the tech they have under lock and key for himself. Escorting Garret is a fantastic excuse to get the fridge.

Whatever happens in that episode really upsets her anyway. Judging from the current episode Im guessing that s Skye gives Ward access to the hard drive after a bit of romance then Ward tries to kill everyone and thats what lets everyone know that hes betrayed SHIELD.Im gonna guess that her power is something to do with technology or logical thinking but if it was known that s Skye has powers as a baby could be parents with powers or something else then I assume it must be a power that a baby can exhibit so the above theories dont really make much sense.I cant wait to find out the truth!Edit I suck at spoilering things sorry for the shitty formatting!,shield,cgtvjvl,7,t5_2rz8z

It was generic serialized attempting to be four quarters fun.Im not a huge Firefly fan but Firefly is a good example.of how to get people to care about and connect with the characters right feom the start. It ran  episodes and has legions of fans who will wax lyrically about whos their favourite and why. Meanwhile it was after the th episode of AoS that anyone did that for an AoS character.Its not just that they started as rotten sterotypes though it doesnt help its that they stayed rotten sterotypes and for the longest while I wondered if any of them had the acting chops. again theyve since all done this but the quality of the first few episodea doesnt cut it and no amount of CGI and stunts can replace it.

In particular the depiction of the MCU Avengers is very much based on the Ultimate Avengers and related comics.In fact Samuel L. Jacksons Nick Fury is taken from the character of Ultimate Nick Fury whos appearance is based on Samuel L. Jackson seriously how meta is that??Within the wider Marvel Multiverse the main comic book continuity is set on Earth the Ultimate Marvel continuity is set on Earth and the MCU is set on Earth.Also Coulson is one of those rare Marvel or DC for that matter characters that did not start in the comic books but due to his popularity was brought into the mainstream Marvel Comics canon.,shield,chic3ys,4,t5_2rz8z

And yet I sit here tearing up a bit even considering the sadness that surrounds what is possibly my favorite pair of characters ever. Newly expressed love between characters that have such dynamic and palpable chemistry suddenly torn apart by sefless sacrifice and implied mental deterioration. Simmons only kissed around his face so she may not love Fitz they way he loves her but I think even if thats true she was obviously deeply touched by the feelings he expressed and he is her very best friend.

1022724,0,t1_chkiwdn,Thats the part that always bothered me about peoples bitching Joss Jed Maurissa and all the EPs were extremely up front about there not being constant cameos and how it would be a very human show.

And when there were small ties to the greater MCU ie. namedropping Bucky Barnes on the memorial wall in the hub the detractors bitched about it feeling forced but by the end of the season Maria saying the name ManThing pretty much gave everyone nerdgasms.I think no matter what there was going to be people bitching about something at the start this is an online community based around something comic book related.

1906030,0,t3_2gf442,There are many not great eps and a couple of total clunkers though not everyone will agree on which ones! but unfortunately the longer important plot points are sort of scattered around and there is something important for understanding where they all are now in every single episode.Id personally say that if nothing else watch at least from episode  The Bridge onward.  I thought Yes Men was extremely poorly written or at least a couple of the main plot points were really dumb but that too has some important arc plot points that you might be frustrated to have missed if you skip it.Alternately you can read a summary of the whole season on Wikipedia or something which will at least give you the main ideas without having to invest any time on the extra stuff.  And then if you watch this season and really like it youll have some fun prequel stuff to watch when the season is over!,shield,ckiv4y7,2,t5_2rz8z

2546286,0,t1_cmqrdg4,I think theyve played up this CWness on purpose. Arrow hasnt had the same issues in a long time they still have some relationship drama and theres that douchebag DJ but its generally handled much less cheesily recently and in the crossover episode they pointed out the issues with both characters at the moment. Arrow is too emotionally damaged and violent hinting that hes going to learn to be Oliver Queen again this season and possibly grow more lighthearted as he becomes Green Arrow while Flash hasnt been taking things seriously enough. Considering the fact that character development seems to be one of the Arrowverses greatest strengths as well as the fact that Reverse Flash just showed up and fucked shit up while the Rogues are coming back after the break I think its safe to say Barrys world is about to become much more difficult and hell have to drop the relationship drama which he already kind of did in telling Iris he loves her in exchange for practicing more so he can deal with his much more experienced villains.,shield,cmqxq05,2,t5_2rz8z

We know from the first Captain America film that Red Skull understood that the ancient myths of Odin and Yggdrasil were based in historical fact hence his ability to find the Tesseract so it seems very likely that he would have looked at other ancient mythologies in the same manner. If thats the case it would make Whitehalls investigation of the Diviner as well as the overarcing blue angel mythology a logical next step in Schmidts endeavor to find the truth behind ancient mysteries.

This is a historical fact.  And the Nazis were no less Christian than the average German which is why the Nazis enjoyed the overwhelming support of the German people!My feelings as a Christian points me to my Lord and Savior as a fighter. It points me to the man who once in loneliness surrounded by a few followers recognized these Jews for what they were and summoned men to fight against them and who Gods truth! was greatest not as a sufferer but as a fighter. In boundless love as a Christian and as a man I read through the passage which tells us how the Lord at last rose in His might and seized the scourge to drive out of the Temple the brood of vipers and adders. How terrific was His fight for the world against the Jewish poison. Today after two thousand years with deepest emotion I recognize more profoundly than ever before the fact that it was for this that He had to shed His blood upon the Cross. As a Christian I have no duty to allow myself to be cheated but I have the duty to be a fighter for truth and justice... And if there is anything which could demonstrate that we are acting rightly it is the distress that daily grows. For as a Christian I have also a duty to my own people.Adolf Hitler in a speech on  April  Norman H. Baynes ed.

3045387,0,t1_codgx00,I honestly dont see him as psychotic or rapey at all.In S when Skye called him a Nazi and said she was going to throw up he totally withdrew and acknowledged that she thought he was a monster to Raina and really hated him to Skye. So he understood her rejection and at least initially accepted it.In S he is so unfazed by her rejection its eerie. Unless you believe he means it when he says he doesnt care what happens to him and that he hopes for her and doesnt want forgiveness etc because for him its not about getting her to love him back its about him proving his sincerity and doing stuff for her. I read the character as extremely codependent. I think hes desperate to replace Garrett with someone else he can devote himself to structure his life around.I dont mean to sound like I think hes right or justified. Hes definitely unhealthy and amoral at best and many of his actions are unequivocally wrong. But I dont see him as psychotically unhealthy and I really cant see where people are get a rape vibe from.And Im not worried about the Skyward shippers.

Why not put the armor under clothes as well then? And why am I even overthinking this it wont do me any good  That Lola drop scene is never not funny xD But what happened to Skyes backpack in it?

She speaks to him and asks him to take her to the man that comes to be known as Inferno his name is Dante lol and she steps through his mouth and is transported to the guy. This Inhuman became a part of the city of Attilan after his terrigenesis. Thats how crazy the Inhuman mutations are. Anyway I dont remember this guy from earlier comics as the royal family usually has Lockjaw port them all over the place. So maybe the writters are still tripping balls. ,shield,cp482ul,3,t5_2rz8z

In T.R.A.C.K.S.  The Well Fitz complains about combing through alien rubble saying a monkey can do it. Ward responds Youre our little monkey.in my head since Bennet is essentially the rookie of the show least amount of acting experience and de Caestecker is kind of the acting prodigy see Ryan Gosling Wards monkey comment implied that Fitz was a lackie when the real lackie is Bennet. Therefore the monkey is a reference to BennetSkye.As to why Fitzs preference changed to a dog if we stick to the theory Skyes whole wet blanket look in Aftershocks could not have been more comparable to a mix of pomeraniangolden retriever super cute????.EDIT after two days of deleting and revising and deleting the stuff I said in this comment Ive decidedly hated too much of what I suggested the show do with this running joke if my theory was correct to not delete it in post.

3560279,0,t3_312fm1,As a graphic designer that was my first thought. SHIELD falls thousands dead massive international conspiracy and their immediate course of action is to go through a rebranding experience? Especially baffling when its not even public facing... They redesigned it for their own secret ship!,shield,cpy3i8y,34,t5_2rz8z
3561172,0,t3_3110g2,They have some valid points but their arguments are also very flawed and internally contradicting.For one thing Coulsons SHIELD is the opposite of Furys in many of the very qualities theyre criticizing.. Coulson wouldntve blown up a ship full of SHIELD agents  he doesnt believe in acceptable losses and has a kind of allforone approach to protecting his people.. He eliminated the ranking system which pretty much guarantees more transparency people wont be kept in the dark just because theyre a level  nor will they be able to access whatever they want just because theyre a level .. He may not be running Shield democratically he expects agents to follow orders fall in line and trust his judgment but he is also not holding himself above other agents.  He regularly puts himself in the field on the front lines.Basically Coulson is not running the same Shield as Fury in the preHYDRA days so that argument is moot.Regarding secrecy I think both sides have good points. More transparency mightve made it easier for agents like Garrett to get the intel they wanted but it would also have made it harder for people like Whitehall to kidnap Skye and her mother under the cover of being Shield. I think they could make the case that HYDRA couldnt have hidden in Shield for  years if it had been more internally transparent. That said since Fury is the one who ultimately caught them it seems stupid to keep focusing on him as the bad guy source of problematic secrecy. Shield always had this problem.Lastly my biggest problem with them is their actions. So far all we know about them is that they spent months undercover spying on people who are basically working towards the same goals. This seems excessive and counterproductive. While I could justify a few days or weeks of spying  just to feel out Coulson and his team before approaching them  months of spying plus a massive infiltration seems excessive.  And on top of that we have no indications theyre doing anything to stop HYDRA or protect people.,shield,cpy76n5,2,t5_2rz8z

3564703,0,t3_3110g2,Heres my take on S.H.I.E.L.D. in generalI dont think that Fury ran S.H.I.E.L.D. in a bad way. I agree that there were definitely flaws but one could argue that his opacity and compartmentalization is what ultimately saved S.H.I.E.L.D. from being completely destroyed by Hydra. There were things that they either had no access to or had only partial access to. There is a lot of truth to the statement Compartmentalizing information means that no one agent has all the information at any given time. Now I know that Fury seems to be a hypocrite because it appears that he DID have all the information but with all the tech that S.H.I.E.L.D.Fury had access to I bet he had some kind of way of forgetting information. I could see the man literally having a way to wipe his own mind hed leave clues as to were he could access the info though that only he could decipher semieasily at least though we have no idea if this is the case I say its in character enough that it is incredibly likely. Where Fury went wrong was trying to use highly advanced tech to create weapons. Making a weapon out of something you barely if at all understand is just asking for it to blow up in your face. Fury intrusted the directorship to Coulson not because hes literally Furys creation as Gonzales put it but because out of everyone in the world I think Coulson was the one person who Fury trusted completely I think he trusts Coulson more than he does even himself. Fury wanted the ship destroyed on the day that S.H.I.E.L.D. fell because whatever the ships cargo was was so powerfulpotential that it would have almost certainly given Hydra the instant win my guess at least. But Fury wanted Gonzales off the ship because he knew Gonzales would make a great leader to the remaining S.H.I.E.L.D. agents and he may have wanted him to be the Director if Coulson didnt make it. True S.H.I.E.L.D.  Fury chose Coulson because A Coulson is the person on Earth that Fury trusts the absolute most B He knew that Coulson understands the balance between compartmentalization and transparency better than anyone else at least in the organization C Coulson is a good man and has no desire for power which makes him a great choice for a leadership role. Coulson has made mistakes but to me he cant be faulted for the Hydra infiltration that ultimately lead to his sanity being affected due to alien blood that Fury used to resurrect him again not his fault. Once Coulson learned of the city it was only to prevent Hydra from using it to unlock what he thought would be a weapon of mass destruction andor cause an extinction level event. He sees enhanced people and Inhumans as people and not just weapons or abominations. This is why I think Coulsons S.H.I.E.L.D. comes out on top.Real S.H.I.E.L.D.  This group wasnt supposed to exist. I think Fury wanted Gonzales to survive because he knew hed be a great help in reviving S.H.I.E.L.D. but I think he wanted him more for support and tactics than to be over S.H.I.E.L.D. he wanted him as Coulsons possible Second in Command. I think that Fury gave Morse the mission of sinking the ship because I think that besides Hawkeye and Black Widow and possibly The Cavalry she is the top specialist he also probably thought that of anyone besides those previously mentioned she could figure out a way to make it out alive. I dont think he is the kind of person who really wants to sacrifice people but whatever that ship is holding is bad enough that he thought the sacrifice of life was necessary kind of like in BSG where they blow up the Cyloninfiltrated ship because it was lets face it its a numbers game sort of situation. Olmost S.H.I.E.L.D. did a good job by not dying but I bet they didnt destroy that cargo and it will come back to haunt them. They also are really hypocritical because they talk about transparency but they use deception subterfuge and espionage just like their predecessor to gain control. They also seem to be extremists who justify murder of enhanced andor Inhuman persons all in the name of defense which goes even beyond Furys stance on these type of people lets face it that was no I.C.E.R. the douche shot at Skye. TLDR  Fury was neither fully right or wrong in his way of running S.H.I.E.L.D. Coulson is neither fully right or wrong but seems to be doing a better job than Fury did Real S.H.I.E.L.D. may think they are doing a good work but they are hypocrites who seemingly want to kill off all enhancedInhuman persons.,shield,cpylpis,1,t5_2rz8z

3603881,0,t1_cq2pv2b,First off let me say thank you so much for your incredibly thorough and thoughtful post.  Reading and writing long analyses of Ward is pretty much my favorite thing about this sub so yay!  And I think that while I still disagree about the Punisher you made some really good points that have made me reconsider some things.gt taking the law into his own hands to do what he feels others wont do.Thats pretty much all heroes since vigilantes and frankly most of SHIELD.  Even when they were legit they were bending and breaking the rules to follow their conscience.gt Ward fights for what he believes in regardless of ethics or moralityMaybe this is semantics but I dont see Ward fighting for what he believes in.  It doesnt seem like he believes in anything.  Its almost like he has the morality of a young child  based solely on relationships with no big picture ethics factoring in.  Someone once pointed out how shocked he was when Skye called him a Nazi  that it was just evidence he had never considered the widerworld ramifications of his actions.  Hell do anything for the people he cares about and people who get in the way whether theyre threats like Victoria Hand or innocents like Thomas Nash are to be eliminated.  He didnt care about protecting people whod been brainwashed while he was at HYDRA so it isnt just that he has a different morality that is ok with killing but not ok with brainwashing though I could see him thinking that way.  He protects people he cares about not strangers.  so far.gt  He punishes people from early on the wording that they have chosen to use  had strong connotations  to punish those for their wrongs to gain vengeanceavenge those who they have wronged. In FZZT he talks about wanting it to be a person who killed the firemen so he could punish them for committing the murders he attacked his brother and killed his family because of the torment that they put him through he helps Kara make Bakshi pay for what he did to herThis is a really good point and something I hadnt noticed before.  Vengeance and punishment are a bigger part of the character than Id realized.gt  I feel that the Ward character has to continue to evolve for fans not to lose interest completely in him having him go from pretend good guy to bad guy who likes this one chick will get boring really fast.Agreed.  Ive never bought of the Ward is completely soulless except that he really loves Skye storyline.  Ive always believed that he genuinely cared for the team admitting to Raina he owes Coulson just less than he owes Garrett admitting he cares about Fitzsimmons but calling it a weakness but chose Garrett because he cared about him more.gt We have seen that since he was saved by Kara hes been more true to himselfHave we?  I think hes playing a part for her too.  I agree with your assessment about playing parts  he became what Garrett needed what Coulson and May wanted what he thought Skye wanted.  I just think now hes becoming what he believe Kara needs  a decisive person to direct and guide her.  I have a suspicion that Ward is incredibly codependent.  At the end of S when Ward begs Garrett for orders his next words were What do you need me to do?  Later he tells Skye he doesnt want forgiveness he just wants to help her and we know hes not lying per Brett Dalton.  I think he has a deep emotional need to be needed to be taking care of someone.  He did everything for Garrett.  Then he did everything for Skye even if she didnt want him to.  Now hes doing everything for Kara.  Maybe shell wake up his true self if he has one.  Or maybe hell just keep molding himself to suit her needs. gt I think that it would be organic for him to develop into something similar to the attributes you apply to Frank Castles Punisher. I think that over time he  really start to feel the need to protect innocents I think that Kara may help him come to this change of heart because ... and this is totally a guess at them moment ... I think that since she was loyal to S.H.I.E.L.D. and was brainwashed by Hydra that says that she was once a good person who wanted to protect people if this is the case I could see her putting her foot down and not allowing Ward to hurt innocentsThats a really good point that I hadnt considered.  I mean Ive been assuming Kara will develop into a powerful villainess with Ward by her side but the opposite is possible.  As she regains her old self she may reacquire the conscience she seems to have lost in which case I think Ward will follow her lead into quasigoodness.Or go off the deep end as someone he cared for and did everything for rejects him again.gt  If you pay attention to him you can tell that he is starting to like to kill people. In Turn Turn Turn you can see a smile on his face when he realizes that he gets to cut those level  agents to bits when they are kicking the shit out of him and sees that knife.I completely disagree.  His smile when he sees the knife is an oh look I can get out of this alive! smile.  Most of his subsequent killings Hand Koenig etc were done with complete coldness.  All of his killing is pragmatic we never see him killing anyone extra.gt If you take the basic concept of The Punisher and forget all the nuances that have defined Frank Castle as the characterThis is where my issue is.  I like Frank Castle as the Punisher his story and motivation.  If Ward becomes a vigilante fine even a vengeful one like maybe someone who targets abusive parents or wipes out HYDRAs top brainwashers and recruiters but I dont want them to conflate two characters who are so different.Anyway thats just my response.  Thanks for you post it was really interesting and had some great points.,shield,cq32gsd,1,t5_2rz8z

You see it with GOT Boardwalk Empire and House of Cards  Quality TV thats worth watching. Saying that Im liking how they are trying to do it with the longer season shows by having  episodes then a mid season break. Keeps the content fresh allows for a larger story arc with many subplots. I hate however the mini season break in the middle of these seasons.  week is ok for certain things think Superbowl etc but  weeks?

Or at least interned at A.I.M. before joining S.H.I.E.L.D. or something like that.After the HYDRA reveal in Turn Turn Turn when she and Tripp are in the Hub and Agent Hand confronts them Simmons stands back quietly and lets Tripp do all the talking and pledge loyalty to S.H.I.E.L.D. on behalf of both of them  so she wouldnt have to lie because shes such a terrible liar. And Tripp is like ooh Jemma youre such a bad liar and she says I know but Im getting better at it with a tone of subdued triumph like she just got away with a significant deception. Then a couple of episodes later shes confronted by Fitz who demands Tell me youre not HYDRA. She specifically says Im not HYDRA with a weirdly specific emphasis on HYDRA.I dont think it would happen now. It would feel like cheap writing to say lol Simmons is a surprise traitor after  seasons gotcha!. But at the time it felt like they were laying the groundwork for it. Not necessarily having her be a malicious double agent but perhaps she previously worked for A.I.M. out of amoral devotion to science and then changed her loyalties to S.H.I.E.L.D. and didnt want people to discover that because theyd never be able to trust her.,shield,cqtl5x4,4,t5_2rz8z

Theyve made that abundantly clear. You cant just keep assuming it because it makes Jiaying look less crazy.gtShe had probably already served her sentence for murdering.Youre just assuming that. she was probably never in the system because anyone else probably would have just cut the razors off.gtGonzales spoke of indexing potential people thats fact.Thats not what he said to Jiaying so you cant use it to justify her craziness. And Gonzales is not in charge. Were going in circles.gtAnd even if they werent SHIELD is still a threat to the freedom of her people.No its not. Its not a violation of freedom to make sure a person is qualified before allowing them to carry a gun or drive a car. The Inhumans arent mutants they werent born this way this is a choice its not a basic human right to be able to teleport.gtWhen you arrive with four troop transports full of armed paramilitary agents everything you say is a demand no matter how nicely you say it.You sound just as crazy and paranoid as Jiaying.

Theyre not exactly some unstoppable invading force.gtalmost every member of Hydra after WW was also a member of SHIELD or the SSR. Thats...just straight up not true.

Jiaying didnt even fucking attempt for it to end in anything else.

I mean I love Brett but Wards character has run his usefulness. Maybe if they made him more redeeming I would have liked him more. But now Im just annoyed with his whole character. Am I the only one who cringes when he calls Kara baby? I mean he just sounds like hes using her no matter how he tries to justify it. Really Kara? You want to torture a Shield agent just to get her to say sorry? You used to be a Shield agent you knew what you were signing up for. I hope shes the first to die.

I mean if they tried to start to redeem him after he was revealed to the audience as Hydra Id be okay with that. But now his character is just annoying.

3954371,0,t1_cr6wcg9,DISCLAIMER I am not defending Ward or saying hes good justified in anyway however he is neither a psychopath nor sociopath.  Those are technical terms and he doesnt meet enough of the criteria. highfunctioning or otherwise.Neither sociopaths nor psychopaths can form emotional attachments to other people or animals.  At all.  All their relationships are selfserving and opportunistic not just some.  Wards relationship with Garrett is the complete opposite of selfserving.  He gives up everything he wants to stand with Garrett.  S took pains to establish repeatedly that Ward was not being rewarded or benefiting from the arrangement having several conversations where Garrett tries to tell Ward its his turn to get what he wants and Ward just persists in wanting to stick with Garret even going so far as to beg for orders.Quinn is a nice contrast.  He took a calculated risk and sacrificed some of his comfort working with Garrett but only because he saw an opportunity to get what he wanted.  As soon as the potential advantage to himself vanished so did he.  Both he and Raina worked with Garrett when it furthered their goals then left when it didnt.  Ward however very conspicuously had no goals beyond serving Garrett.  His now that youre saved  lets leave HYDRA  or whatever Ill go where you go speech confirms that.How Garrett chooses to manipulate Ward is also telling.  More than once Garrett plays on Wards need for approval such as by threatening not to like him anymore when he complains about Deathlok nearly killing him and his sense of gratitude when Ward reminds Garrett hed promised to do this without bloodshed.  Both in the present and flashback he motivates Ward by admitting hes dying.  None of these tactics would work on a psychosociopath because of their inability to form emotional bonds or feel normal emotions.  Garrett was a master manipulator.  He knew how to work selfish people appealing to Rainas curiosity and sense of greatness appealing to Quinns hunger for money and power.  He also knew Ward better than anyone so if he was using these tactics it was because they worked.Other things that dont quite jive with the psychopath sociopath theory Wards relationship with his dog.  Even if he obediently shot him a real psychosociopath wouldnt have balked at the idea.  Most psychosociopaths start torturing animals in adolescence  something we see no evidence of with Ward who dotes on his dog and regards him as better than human.  Garretts criticisms of Ward  that hes a soft touch that he gets attached to people Garrett believes Ward wouldve found killing the team easier if hed given the order earlier that connections and relationships are his weakness.  I also doubt he would have expressed sadness during the medpod incident or confessed to Skye that he wasnt good in Only Light in the Darkness.  These are the actions of someone who forms real emotional attachments and who wants other people to accept him for himself not just use them to get what he wants and again its really telling that so far all hes ever wanted is related to other people.While Ward would definitely score higher on the psychopath test than average he seems more like a morally stunted codependent to me  someone who needs another person to center himself around because he cant function from his innate self.  It may not make him a better person but its a more accurate assessment of his character IMO.,shield,cr715tk,3,t5_2rz8z

If Afleck had good writers on the original Daredevil there is no doubt in my mind could play it pretty well.When comparing AoU to the AoS finale you arent even in the same league. The shows great but youre comparing it to the tip top of the comic world right now. AoU may have not lived up to the hype or disappointed some people but it was an incredible film and this show is no where near a good. Its a great show but its limited by the fact that its on TV.

4098183,0,t1_crne58q,Generally speaking if youre expecting hacking in TV or movies to be accurate youre going to be sorely disappointed. Its better to just suspend your disbelief about this stuff than continue to nitpick things in a show where aliens and gods exist. I cant guarantee the hacking scenes will get any better but I just recommend not to think about it too much and focus on the characters development in the show.Im not sure what youre mean by social engineering but Skye becomes an incredibly kickass agent by the second season and a revelation in the midseason finale changes her entire dynamic as a character. In fact I sometimes forget that Skye was a hacker in the first season because she kicks so much ass in other ways in the second season. Overall I suggest you keep watching to see where she and the rest of the cast develops. Skye becomes an incredibly different person over the course of the series and shes among one of my favorite characters on the show currently. In fact all the characters are wellwritten and change in ways that are both positive and detrimental towards their characters that it makes for some damn interesting television.,shield,crnf2jl,1,t5_2rz8z

At the same time now that theyve introduced these storylines and abilities I think we will see more main characters getting enhanced or using mystical weapons to stay competitive or hightech weapons built by Fitz science biatch. IMO Ward is the most likely to get enhanced either through an inhuman reveal or an accident or by deliberate choice.Simmons probably wont spend months away from the main cast although Ward did so what do I know? unless it directly connects to what everyone else is doing.,shield,crrv83q,4,t5_2rz8z

4163161,0,t3_38ebmk,I really dislike the Lost style of mystery where you keep throwing weird vagueness at the audience to make them wonder about its significance and theres never much satisfaction because any answer  if they provide answers  is either revealed in the form of a new question or immediately followed by two more questions. Or worse the answer doesnt stand up to the anticipation you spent so long building. Its just a tease whats in the hatch whats the smoke monster whats up with the polar bear what are the numbers who are those guys how come Locke can walk. Storytelling and character interactions may occur around these teases but the breadcrumb trail of mysteries is purely there for the audience not the characters.Whats the deal with Coulson? Didnt he die? Whats up with Tahiti? Pretty mysterious hey? was season s thing and it quickly became tiresome. Along with the Clairvoyant Centipede the symbols etc. The answers to these questions were interesting but the setup was very tedious.Season  took off in ep  when it started to focus more heavily on the spy game betrayals and treachery yes these things are intrigues but they involve characters interactions with each other not the show keeping secrets from the audience.Season s longest mystery was the ObeliskDiviner which everyone spent half the season chasing after. The season was much more about developing characters their motivations and relationshipsinteractions. There were intrigues but they were more closely integrated with the characters like Simmons being HYDRA Ward doing Ward stuff Coulson diverting funds Madame Masque Mack choking people out. The lack of drawnout repeatedly dangled questions made pacing feel much faster.,shield,crut5y2,3,t5_2rz8z

And Fitz made it clear to Jemma that he was mad at her for leaving in either SE or SE I dont remember which episode their argument was at.gt And that he wont discuss any of those problems because theres nothing to discuss?Thats because there isnt anything to discuss Jemma left after his confession and acted like it never happened. She didnt acknowledge the confession until the finale I think leaving and pretending it didnt happen would come across as I dont want to date you.Fitz told Mack its not good to hide things because he understands the damage it can do he also knows what its like to lose control over your actions.

The similarity of the gravitonium and rock is very interesting. Both are dangerous powerful objects that have swallowed up people who are still alive inside. The gravitonium is also the third big unresolved mystery in AOS and was introduced in the third episode of Season . The other two big mysteries were Coulsons return and Skyes origins introduced respectively in the first and  second episodes then resolved in the first and second seasons.Also now that Ward is running Hydra he might contact Quinn to see if he wants to work with him.,shield,cvipaiw,1,t5_2rz8z

5666379,0,t1_cwzgou2,I dont think so. Anyway its far more believable that a man in a suit is able to fly than a biological being who doesnt have wings and is manipulating frequencies with her mind. They are a lot closer today to make robots that can fly and thus they could potentially in the future make robotic metal suits that could. There is basically no modern scientific way to explain a person using their mind to manipulate frequencies in order to overcome gravity.And before you throw out Then by your logic Daisy shouldnt be able to use her powers at all my defense to such a statement is that yes certain things in this cinematic universe are pure fantasy or fiction but even so the farther away from real science you get the less likely the audience will accept. And the suspension of disbelief is what allows an audience to truly enjoy a film or TV show. People would come closer to believing that an Inhuman could manipulate frequencies than they would be able to buy that unassisted by science she could fly. Thats a fact.

5672201,0,t1_cwzqg93,Thats true. We dont know Lashs Terrigenesis story. What we can go off of though is how others have gone through the transformation. In the comics not all Inhumans form a cocoon around them when they go through the transformation. For the ones that did form a cocoon the time before hatching varied sometimes on how much Inhuman genetic code a person might possess and how dominant or recessive it might be and also to the quantity and purity of the Terrigen that sets off the transformation. But once they hatched from the cocoon that was it. They were Inhuman and they didnt go back and forth. Same goes for the other Inhumans that went through the transformation without forming a cocoon. They became Inhuman and they didnt go back and forth.Andrew went through the transformation when he was on vacation in Hawaii with May. Months have passed since he came out of his cocoon. So the show is telling us that its taking Andrew months to transition??? Thats never happened in the comics. This therefore is the reason why I say they took liberties with Lashs Terrigenesis story.

Rewatching S and whereas I dont blame her I think that even though he was a delusional son of a bitch he was still kinda redeemable at that point. Yeah he killed Hand which didnt help his cause but hed finally gotten closure over his brother albeit not in the most emotionally healthy way... had betrayed HYDRA and had been  genuine to Skye and the team since his capture.

Dont try to pretend you know who I am or what I think. I am neither clueless about PTSD an American or a Ward apologist.Im not saying it will fix anything Im saying that both part did something wrong and its not something as simple as UNITBlackArchive painted.Your post is clearly an example of how bad people can react to stuff like that.

S saw interaction with a Chinese division. Both S and S reference global operatives and groups. This is an established quality of SHIELD. Future episodes will reference and show this as well when the plot requires it. We dont need the show to take a moment to prove itself as multinational partly because we already know this but mostly because it would be forced. The show is about a specific group of people. Showing how global SHIELD is isnt preferable because its largely irrelevant to the stories of these characters. Referencing the global nature in conjunction with plot relevant showings of this nature is more than enough to get that across. ,shield,cypdgwd,4,t5_2rz8z

Not hard to imagine give the current state of affairs and bugs out telling May to watch the team for a few days. He gets in Lola and drives... all the way to the Audreys house. Some rainy Tuesday night he shows up out of the blue standing on her doorstep. She cries he explains. He tells her everything absolutely everything about what happened and why. They hug they hold each other on the couch. She asks him why hes telling her this after all this time. He shrugs and says It occurred to me the other day that... Im the director to hell with it. He also tells her that he realized that she never got a chance to weigh in about the whole situation. They have a long uncensored talk about his life and what he wants her life and what she wants and they both realize that it really would not work. She really doesnt want into the spy life and he cant leave out of his sense of duty. They agree to part. She tells him that shes proud of him for all that he does. On the way out the door she asks slightly pointedly about May. She tells him that May sounds like a wonderful woman. They smile kiss and part... never to see each other again. . Nazis in Peru!I leave them for Doctor Jones. Im bored with Nazis as antagonists. . Graviton andor Ian QuinnIan Quin reemerges when they receive a call on an old abandon SHIELD contact number from a cell phone at a gas station in Bumblefuck Nowhere. The team finds a battered and traumatized Ian Quinn reduced to a gibbering wildeyed maniac hiding in a dumpster behind the shop terrified that he was going to find him. We find out from Ian that after he absconded with the gravitionium during Garretts downfall he went into hiding in remote Africa. While there Graviton emerged and made his presence known. Graviton furious at Ian for causing his accident and for endangering the planet made Ian his servant and tortured him for months while he practiced controlling his powers. Id make Graviton a floating villain for the rest of the series. Not quite evil not fond of Hydra but no longer trusting SHIELD he eventually decides the only way to keep the world safe is if its in his control. Id keep Ian around as a toady until he eventually kills himself rather than return to Gravitons control. . Donnie Gill a.k.a. BlizzardHunter finds a frozen toe in his Martini. not a big Donnie Gill fan. Escapees from the FridgePut Bobbi and Hunter on permanent assignment to find them and capture them. Give them a spin off show called Marvels Most Wanted.. The Berserker Staff I seriously doubt it was actually destroyed After the staff was lost Elliot Randolph quietly arranged to purchase the ruins and dug through them himself to find the staff. As the last remnant of his Asgardian heritage it was the only thing that might attract people to him and risk his comfortable human life. Afterwords he hid it again and then changed his identity buying a small beachside resort on Little Cayman and spending the next generation drinking at his own bar catching up on his reading and doing his damnedest to avoid the increasing goings on of all these superheros. . Deathlok Mike Peterson returns to SHEILD to join the Secret Warriors. He eventually starts an unlikely relationship with Dr. Weaver. which sounded crazy when I first wrote it but now Im kinda liking the idea of Blue CollarAcademia opposites attract kinda thing. J.

For some similar reasons I have been so pleased with Gideon Malick who also has such a dominating presence. His zealotlike obsessiveness paired with his obvious outward pragmatism as an Industrialist and World Security Council member makes him truly terrifying. Imagine that people you know to be in power who seem to be fairly straightlaced that are actually completely bonkers and TRULY desire to be subservient to an alien godfigureoverlord... When he asked Jemma Tell me Did you see It? and later when he told Ward You will look It in the eye. I got chills.    I hope he stays around for a while and gets his due.

Apparently we only get his backstory through a throwaway line from James and vague implications from others while Malick had a fullblown flashback. I feel like he has potential but the writers dont really seem to be in hurry to give him development. Characters like Joey YoYo and James get away with because they were likable and humorous from the start without seeming like a forced love interest. If he dies in the finale without further development like he had recently then I would feel the writers really wasted his character. If he does go I hope he goes out with a bang!!

Its the obvious choice. I just wont be happy about it. I guess well find out soon. For the record I really dont want the other mains to die but just like the Walking Dead if its just some half red shirt that nobody really cares about theres no impact. We know Coulson and Daisy live. But if Mack May Fitz or Simmons died people would be pretty floored. In the long run its a good thing for the series.

Pardon me but the status quo for connections across the MCU is frankly speaking kinda stupid. Putting your movie actors in your TV shows and referencing the TV shows directly in your films to connect the two mediums is a guaranteed way to boost ratings which in turn draws more people into the movies. The reasons why it hasnt happened more often is likely political not economic or logistic and many fans myself included want to see the universe get bigger and more inclusive.So no thank you.

The rating would coincide with Daredevil on Netflix so either way it would be more competitive.

7846301,0,t3_4msg2c,I just want to see them again but i will strongly argue for elsewhere in the MCU.Bringing them back invalidates their last episode and makes it pointless and literally contributes nothing. But at the moment they have a great opportunity to crossover somewhere else and not bring up any problemsHard to schedule they came from a show but they arent part of a show any more. Also we have already seen their last episode so we and the writers know where those characters have ended up to easilly bring them in somewhere elseToo confusing for normal audiences their exit allows them to show up as random mercenaries without having to or being allowed to mention shield. They can allude to their past but the same way new characters exposition themselvesWont fit too forced they are experienced with powered people and vigilantes. Which is literally every other show in the MCU. They can fit in naturally anywhere. Maybe hired guns against or allies of any defenders or punisher or cloak and dagger or slumming it from their viewpoint as damage controlSeriously there is everything to lose if you just keep them in the aos sandbox and everything to gain if you take the chance for another shared universe connection ,shield,d3xzre0,12,t5_2rz8z

8530652,0,t1_d67aodo,In my opinion Season  of Daredevil kind of already drop a major hint that at least something supernatural and not technology related exist. You see members of The Hand were already immortal Daredevil mentions he cant hear there heart beats and that was why they were able to sneak up on him so many times and there was that one scene where during an autopsy that we found out that the man had the classical Y cut. Meaning that body already went through an autopsy. Plus we actaully see Nabo sp? literally come back from the dead only minutes after receiving a litheal wound. And there was no technoloy at all. Although Daredevil and even Foggy were still skeptical of magic at the end but it seems that some form of magic does exist in the MCU. Maybe the Asgardians do use a mix of really advanced technology and magic but they are not allowed to tell the humans like maybe there is some kind of Prime Directive stating do not tell them anything that they dont know because  fill in the blank here.,shield,d67w8xw,3,t5_2rz8z

9126363,0,t3_558lpi,First off please God not Nomad that was the worst thing to ever happen to Cap until the whole Hydra thing and Im counting the Liefeld Boob era too.  Nomad was a salty onedimensional projection of Vietnam War era disillusionment with the government and military.  It wouldnt work with todays audience and really it would be an insult to everyone who supports the military today.  I consider the late ss demonization of our troops to be as anachronistic and regrettable as calling black people by the nword something weve come to learn is simply unacceptable behavior for an enlightened society and so bringing back Nomad would be akin to having an offensive s black sidekick on the show asking if anyone needs a shoeshine.Secondly yes Jeffrey Mace was the Patriot.  But Ive floated an idea in another thread...he might end up as USAgent who was more of a morally nebulous version of Cap and who had actual powers unlike Patriot.  Thatd let him play a pseudoCap without actually pushing Chris Evans out of the role.Also I very much doubt theyd introduce a new actor for a marquee tentpole cinematic role on a TV show and then just drop him into Infinity War and to someone whose biggest roles so far might be on Terra Nova or as the voice for cartoon Batman.,shield,d88u92m,4,t5_2rz8z

These tortured souls walking on the fine line between right and wrong.  i hope you get the idea.Can you suggest me some essential Ghost Rider comics? Some of the best story wise and i would not mind reading some of his lore.Thanks and have a nice day,shield,d9ag2cl,7,t5_2rz8z

She might not know all the details but she certainly knows that and id argue lying about the whereabouts of a known fugitive and murderer is worse than lying about a currently harmless robot in Radcliffes house. Plus if were getting nitpicky about it Jemma figured out AIDA wasnt human within a minute of walking through Radcliffes door. So technically she unwittingly got herself into the mess that Fitz was trying to avoid.I honestly dont think there will be repercussions for her actions for a while.

9637759,0,t1_da10wso,Well I think this is an indication that the films and the shows are at least wanting to be connected. Unless something changed in the last few weeks Feige himself said that the Inhumans film will definitely happen. Hes not known for SPOILING things and is extremely choosy with how he words things and hes also not known for trolling fans that much either. Basically at least to me it sounds like they are trying to build a bridge between the continuity created by AoS and what will become the continuity of the film. No matter what issues there are between Marvel TV and Marvel Studios Disney the owner of Marvel in general wants its cash cow called the MCU to keep on giving that milk. I truly dont think that they would allow continuity between film and show to happen simply because one of the overall greatest praises that fans and critics alike rattle off is that the at least so far the MCU feels connected not necessarily that there is a lot of crossover but that the continuity in both directions hasnt been contradictory. It remains to be seen what this will ultimately bring to this shared universe but it does seem to indicate that Marvel is willing to try and make the concept work. I mean Feige did say that sooner rather than later the films would start to reference the shows and next year wouldnt be too late to start building something that films could reference. IF the Inhuman Royal Family exists and they literally mean that it takes place in present day that would mean that this show could possibly bridge the gap between Civil WarThorRagnarok and Infinity War since all  films next year and likely Black Panther as well will not take place in the year they are released Spideys film takes place in  Guardians  take place roughly  months after GotG ... so  IIRC and Thor  takes place concurrently with Civil War its also been hinted at that Black Panther probably takes place towards the end of  and possibly the beginning of .That could mean that Inhumans is the thing that will fill us in on what is going on just before Thanos shows up. And that could also indicate that the Inhumans may play a role in Infinity War which would make sense given that the film was initially meant to release between the two parts of the Infinity War films. Its all conjecture but there is some real reasons this could be true.,shield,da11wfo,1,t5_2rz8z

10353053,0,t1_dch2306,Exactly. Im Asian and a big supporter of more racially diverse casting in the model of AoS casting diverse actors to play roles that arent about racegender but I think the criticism Marvel got over Tilda Swinton was ridiculous. They were stuck in a no win situation  cast an Asian person in the role and be accused of caricaturing them or cast a white person and be accused of whitewashing. And even if they had made the Ancient One a virile powerful young Asian person they still would have gotten the caricature accusation because the role the character fulfills plays a part in how its perceived. So they changed the character from one minority to another and still got flack.,shield,dchkuw4,5,t5_2rz8z

Unless he was under oath in a court of law saying I grab women by the genitals without permission he or anyone can and have argued that he was making a cruel disgusting joke.There have been accusations of sexual assault. And yes smoke usually means fire. BUT if we really care and value our freedoms like we say we do we cannot assign guilt to him no matter how much we hate him without evidence. And an accusation is just an accusation until evidence and facts are brought forward conclusively proving he did in fact rape or sexually assault women. If we label him guilty without due process or any evidence we are as no good as his administration is with presenting alternative facts.I would agree he probably is racist from all of his remarks and shenanigans. However even former president obama has come out and said his election is legitimate. No one hacked into the voting machines to change votes as far as we know. The Russians may have tried to influence the election via fake news but it was the people in key states who decided how to vote. No one held a gun to their head. No one changed their vote with out their knowledge. They made the conscious decision to vote trump after hearing all the different stories and doing their research or lack of. If the opposite were to happen with Clinton winning and talks of Russian influence to help her win in a hypothetical scenario im fairly certain no one on the left would even be attempting to call her hypothetical election illegitimate. Yes Russia tried to swing it by doing some underhanded things. But they couldnt do the one thing that would actually make it illegitimate hack into voting machines and change votes.,shield,dcsr87r,1,t5_2rz8z

He probably never even thought to give May any directives for what should happen if she encounters a Daisy LMD. That essentially makes her more free than the other LMDs and enables her to do what May would normally do while being just as augmented as every other LMD.Plus Radcliffe already has the Darkhold so her purpose has been fulfilled... yet shes awake and fully functional,shield,dds4ygy,31,t5_2rz8z

The problem is how to work that with standard TV contracts which generally tie an actor to a show for up to  years with contractually mandated numbers of episodes so if any of the cast is looking for a steadier role than Netflixs irregular programming it could make it difficult.

Secondly why does that necessarily mean that their broadcast viewership was significantly higher than reported by Nielsen? It seems entirely plausible that those shows had low broadcast viewership despite possibly high online viewership in which case Nielsens numbers would not be wrong because again Nielsens main purpose is to measure the viewership of TVcommercials online streams typically have different ads and are thus counted separately.gt The fact is that broadcast is dying and cable will soon fallow.

I think its very virtual definitely a situationbut because the Darkhold is a Satanicmagical book it was able to replicate literally everything about our world but with changes.Yeah it is only a simulation that the Darkhold somehow touched up. Sure since the Darkhold is basically a book of black magic and nothing good every comes from it no matter how noblegood the persons original intent  could be it is going to really mess with anyone who would use it in any way. We have already seen to what happened with both Radcliffe and The Superior but I wonder if Fitz actually was able to read the Darkhold via the information he downloaded from that AIDA severed head and I also wounder if how the book affected him? it messes you up pretty bad and you never really get what you want in the first place and that is how this book would screw with you. gtI definitely foresee them dealing with the morality of shutting it down. If they delete the Framework will they be in essence killing people? I think theyre gonna have to deal with that question before the season is over.Personally I dont see them dong this. I mean the way they dealt with the morality of Fitz help creating AIDA and help creating the cascading events leading to the final episode was enough to piss me off and to disappoint me in any future discussions about this shows morality. I mean the way Simmons was towards Mack was in  my opinion shitty and she was wrong even if she is trying to stick by her boyfriend everything those two has done has lead to a disaster and now Simmons was like yeah Fitz cant be held responsible because I said so....

11423075,0,t1_dfmg2p4,Season  gets compared to the mcu movies.  Which is wildly unfair.  But in reality it did well enough that marvel did a bunch of other shows.  Just like how daredevil did well so we got jj and ironfist.  But at the time remember there wasnt really any mcu tv.  And they launched the show off of the popularity of the avengers.  I think it was judged unfairly and that thought has stuck. I liked all the references to the avengers all the time in s.  But when i rewatch i think its a little lame.  But Im  times more invested in these characters than others.  This is really the show that ties the movies together for me.  Like...  It makes the mcu real as a universe.  Otherwise its just a series of movies.  Wish they coild do bigger better integration though.  Open the shield characters to be added to movies once in a while. Like i swear if some avengers were flying somewhere and may was the pilot itd be wicked awesome.  ,shield,dfqslj9,1,t5_2rz8z

11503798,0,t1_dfzulpx,But thats assuming that the world was an exact copy of ours down to the last detail and only then was it altered by the people who went into it rather than it being an approximation of our world that was fleshed out by the people who went into it. And it could have been the former I suppose in which case we would have to lean on the magic of the darkhold to explain how things that are impossible to know can be incorporated. And I dont just mean knowledge of the winter soldier but also the content of a given persons closet what large fossil finds are left in the earth or the secret desire of Gus Tweedy from Haverton Alabama to dress up as a duckling and get spanked. Things that simply dont exist as information and therefore cannot be known without well without omnipotence. I get that the darkhold is powerful but Im not sure that omnipotence was ever suggested to be among those powers. Knowledge certainly the ability to look into or adapt to the mind of the wielder sure. But from that to knowing every unknowable detail of the world is a huge leap. And so if it isnt an exact copy of our world and is instead a limited in fact although equal in depth approximation then theres no reason to assume that the winter soldier is included in that approximation. ,shield,dfzyf4q,3,t5_2rz8z

11548347,0,t3_64u08b,I actually like that they brought him back without forcing the storyline towards it. This way it became a real surprise for most. It also feels more like a cameo now for me in stead of WARD is back again.However i see where you are coming from. I think he reminds a lot of people of the Season  Ward when he wasnt hydra he was a poweful and valuable asset to the team. That Ward would be valuable to the team now as well but it would be overkill in my opinion certainly if they explain to Ward LMD what he did in the real world. Nobody except the team would accept him outside the Framework. Hydra agents and symphatisers could be after him. All in all not what the show needs right now and to messy for the storyplot in my opinion.,shield,dg50aj2,25,t5_2rz8z

11574271,0,t3_65714r,I think its really him but his mind has been overwritten moreso than the others. AIDA has always had a thing for Fitz so when she sent them all into the Framework with their new memories she took special care to change Fitz. She made him far more dependent on and loyal to her so that she would be have greater influence over him. Add in the influence of his father throughout his life and take away good influences like Jemma and Coulson and its not that hard to see why Fitz is coldblooded. ,shield,dg7y751,6,t5_2rz8z

11676739,0,t3_66i5oz,Great post however I have a couple questions   thought it was redacted  spoiler from sneak peek for next week who recruited FWard into FW Shield not Garrett. Did FWard mention in the show that he defected to join SHIELD? I didnt remember this part. This is not really discussed here but I always wondered about this How did AIDA obtain Wards memory amp biometric info to create his backstory  physicality to such great accuracy since Wards body was destroyed long before the FW was created? ,shield,dgjkpcu,1,t5_2rz8z
11678873,0,t1_dgjrl5a,Yeah. I think its a bit odd they keep calling them regrets if his regret is honestly that his daughter died. Someone dying isnt a regret unless you somehow killed them on purpose or by mistake. I dont see how it would fit that Mack somehow killed his daughter.It could be there was some kind of medical call during her birth that may have saved Hope but killed her mother and Mack could have made that call differently. ,shield,dgjtf2a,6,t5_2rz8z

I love how the changes in the Framework are just so simpel and believable I mean you already said it it doesnt feel unreal.All the changes in characters just make sense. There is nothing weird or surreal about them. It all is something we asked ourselves in previous seasons in a way.Even though it hurts my heart to see FitzSimmons like this its the best route the writers could have chosen and that reduces my pain by .,shield,dgrzaiy,26,t5_2rz8z
11751595,0,t3_67nt4h,Yeah theres no way hes coming back to the real world. His framework saga is to show us the Ward always loved Skye and thats the little honoring we as the viewers get for his character.,shield,dgs2mq9,7,t5_2rz8z

11753809,0,t1_dgsbcgl,On paper it is not authoritarian. But when I think of who is most likely to utilize this law it would in opinion be mega churches and Evangelical activist churches whos views would align with more authoritarian ideals. But overall my biggest example of trumps authoritarian views are the fact that he doesnt even try to go to congress to do things when his party has the majority. The Muslim ban and sanctuary cities EO would have probably easily passed a republican congress. But he doesnt even think to do that. His frame is I have the power and they will all listen to me. Also consistently attacking independent judges is authoritarian behavior. ,shield,dgsbnxv,4,t5_2rz8z

11758616,0,t3_67qb0t,Its been implied that this Simmons is from Ophelias Earth. It appears were getting a similar multiverse story arc to last season of The Flash where the Flash from that other world showed up to fight Zoom and there were alternate versions of Reverb and Killer Frost. And I cant say Im disappointed to see this resolution considering how long Ophelias reality has been set up.I agree that its been poorly handled though. It feels like everyone is turning against Hydra now. First Ward then Skye and now May. But maybe thats the point. Its always darkest before the dawn. Ill say May will almost definitely come back to Hydra after she sees the Resistances true colors for herself. Considering her chemistry with the teacher hell probably join Hydra next season.Skye with her Inhuman abilities being gained the exact episode the Patriot dies appears like shell be the next big bad. And with the way she casually tossed Ophelia out the window shell be a frightening one. I hate them throwing out all of her development but I have to admit that I like her much better as a villain.,shield,dgsvaia,29,t5_2rz8z
