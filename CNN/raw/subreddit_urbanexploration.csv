Picking a lock although it doesnt really damage anything is a bit too close to breaking in for me though.Also youre never usually the first to an abandoned site to explore it.

2147363,0,t3_2jjua7,Ive never tried to go through a locked one a group in philly shared info on buildings with broken or unlocked doors but some looked easy enough to open with the credit card shim method but most were well made doors where the latch bolt went into the strike plate properly or that area was covered with a metal plate to restrict access to the bolt. There were also a bunch that didnt look locked but had a fire alarm attached to them. Ive always wanted to learn how to bypass these and to do it for the thrill but I dont want to damage a door or set off an alarm so Ive never tried. I have a sneaking suspicion that its super easy especially if its just the magnet switch type which could be handled with a knife and some wire. Im not sure how youd go about disarming the push bar alarms though. One way I got past a locked roof door in a hostel in NY was to go through a window in the hallway and climb the fire escape. That building was really old and only  or  stories tall though. You can also try your hand at lock picking working a pick gun or getting a bump key which could get you past numerous locks with a little skill and practice. It might sound impractical but pick guns can do wonders or break locks and are easy to learn to use and bump keys are similarly easy to use. ,urbanexploration,clcs1n4,2,t5_2qkvl

Air circulates throughout the system. However one should be prepared and willing to turn back upon encountering stagnant air. I had many hours and miles of exploring underground only once did I encounter an area where we had a concern with air quality. I was a drain which was being added onto. The city had completed laying a section of large round concrete pipe but had not completed the smaller pipes which feed into in. We decided to return when that entire section had been completed. It will be more interesting then.The biggest danger in the drains has to do with the wet footing and the debris that washes into the drain.

Ask for tips on specific places. Find out how often other people go past it. Dont park your car near where youre exploring. See if you can find friends to join you maybe one of them is willing to stay on the outside and be a lookout. IMHO police mostly patrol abandoned places to make sure nobody is doing drugs or other severely illegal stuff there. If youre just a guy taking pictures they might just tell you to move along.

You may also be detained under antiterrorism laws in some legislatures surrendering certain rights you would otherwise have as a regular criminal.If you entered an active tunnel via a station you were almost definitely captured on CCTV doing so. Be aware that if you try and reenter at the same location in the future you may find it increasingly harder to get away with.Whilst I personally dont recommend trespassing into active rail tunnels I understand some people enjoy it and think its fine. My only recommendation would be that you seek out information on the legality of what you are doing so you are well informed if you are ever caught.
