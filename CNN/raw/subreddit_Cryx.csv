1504608,0,t3_2as33v,It depends on who Im running. My goto antieHaley list is pretty much standard eGaspy.The Excarnate  Bile purge WILL kill off most of their infantry including Boomhowlers.The clouds are a huge problem for them as well.And later in the game when you feat the Stormwall WILL die. Once thats gone eHaley doesnt have much else left to do. Shes worse in a stand up fight than Gaspy.The main thing is to just keep Gaspy protected long enough and just grind Haley out of the game.,Cryx,cj4vjie,1,t5_32k10

11774549,0,t1_dguljzc,I like Gaspy  for this list as well but Im more comfortable having  ways of MAT boosting with as much Circle and Legion I tend to play. Also Im a Skarre fanboy.,Cryx,dguohlk,1,t5_32k10
