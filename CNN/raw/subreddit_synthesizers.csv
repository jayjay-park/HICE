414526,0,t3_1yl1mc,Matrix prosThick lush pads full bass. The filter produces wonderfully musical results. This synth just sounds great imo much better than the tetra. tons of modulation options so cheap for what you are getting Matrix cons programming this thing is a headache. You will need to find some way to send sysex control to it iPad or computer. There are no really great options for control all the solutions are at least a little buggy. Basically you wont be able to twist knobs in real time. The tone is a bit to full hardly a con. The matrix can easily overpower and muddy up your mix. I often find myself programming a great sounding patch only to have to heavily eq it in the mix. The  is pretty big the  not so much. Tetra prosProgramming is much easier than the matrix although still quite limited on the unit itself. There are tons of options controls because of the full midi implementation just get any decent midi controller and you are set. It is even better if you eventually get a mopho keyboard or some other DSI keyboard as you can dump the patches to and from each other turning your mopho into a five voice monster. Tons of modulation options  lfos  sequences  envelopes etc. The brassy tone really sits well in a mix. I hardly ever have to eq. Compact. Tetra consThe brassy sounding filter does not sound very good to me by itself. The resonance has a tendency to suck the bass out of the tone when pushed past . The filter also begins to self oscillate just past  which really limits the filters musically useful range.Only  voices. I feel like a poly synth needs at least  voices to really play with both hands. Final thoughtsNot knowing you full situation I would recommend the Matrix. In my mind the distinction between these two synths is tone. The Matrix has that classic Oberheim lush thickness that the Tetra just cant touch. However there is a reason the Matrix is so cheap. MIDI was only a few years old when this unit was produced and it is really difficult to work with. You will have an extremely hard time programming it if you are not proficient in synthesis. But really both are awesome synths and either one will serve you well. ,synthesizers,cfnqc2c,1,t5_2rdyc

432205,0,t1_cfpeaio,Remember that most classic synths are subtractive i.e. the untreated audio signal is of a harmonically rich waveform e.g. square pulse saw triangle that is then fed through filters thus Subtractive. Such waveforms are easily generated with a relaxation oscillator which is to be contrasted with a harmonic oscillator whose purpose is to generate a sine wave. As mentioned somewhere else in this thread a comparator can also be used indeed many relaxation oscillators have a comparator incorporated into their designs. For instance one could run a sine wave into a comparator to produce a square wave output or even a pulse output if the threshold is changed.  What youre talking about is of course additive synthesis which is the synthesis method employed in pipe organs and tonewheel organs.,synthesizers,cfpk9sh,5,t5_2rdyc

591647,0,t3_20vz5z,it really depends on what type of synth you are playing. Some synths have on board arpeggiators that will play a melody while you get to knobbing.Other synths can take MIDI. And some have USB interfaces. So for example with my Doepfer Dark Energy it has an internal arppegiator but also it has MIDI in and also USB. With the USB I can write an intricate line via Ableton and have Ableton play the synth while i fiddle. Also with older analog gear and new modular stuff sequencing can be done by sending control voltage signals of different values. So my Pittsburgh oscillator runs on a scale of voctave so the value of certain voltages can produce specific notes,synthesizers,cg7ivgz,2,t5_2rdyc

596549,0,t3_20z27d,Depending on the type of filter changing the resonance of the filter alters many components within its frequency response.  For example the effect of changing the resonance on a LowHigh Pass filter is increasing the gain at the cutoff or resonant frequency.  This can significantly increase the dynamic range of the audio signal and depending on the normalization algorithms the nonresonant frequencies may not be attenuated.Other filters behave in other ways.  When you increase the gain at the resonant frequency of a band pass filter the bandwidth is reduced which may stop the important harmonics of your signal.  ,synthesizers,cg82xy5,7,t5_2rdyc

723992,0,t3_22ge2j,Depends on what you mean by performance oriented. If your plan is having a lot of direct control with minimal menu diving the Elektrons AARMDOT might not be for you. While they are wonderful and inspiring to use they have a learning curve since only one part of one tracks controls are available at one time.The Tempest has a similar problem where only one tracks controls are available at one time.Ok yes both the AAR and Tempest have performance controls that allow altering multiple tracks at one but not full direct control ... and you have to set them up.I understand there are hidden controls on the Tanzbar. But its controls that arent as common for tweaking.The Octatrack does require samples to get started. But you can sample directly on it so you can sample synths or resample itself to get content.The TR and the Tanzbar are the only ones that have a to control scheme like the Volca Beats mostly does. Granted its a lot more limited architecture than the others but it does what it does.That said the MD is a fantastic and deep drum machine. If you are looking for something that has the capability of a lot of interesting sounds its still a worthwhile purchase. Its the one out of all listed well other than the OT but its a sampler so it cheats lol that has the most varied sound palette.The Tempest seems to be the best in terms of features. But I know there are people who are unhappy with it Ive never used one so I cant judge. Ive heard a TON of great sounds from them.If you want samples Id recommend an Octatrack Analog Rhythm or Machinedrum UW User Waves adds sampling. If its got to be Analog Id recommend the Analog Rhythm or Tempest. If you want classic sounds Id recommend the TR or Tanzbar. If you want lots of crazy sounds but still great for drums Id recommend that Machinedrum nonUW model.,synthesizers,cgmkkqc,1,t5_2rdyc

The Tempest is a hybrid mostly Analog with some built in drum samples where each voice is a generic synth voice so you have a lot more freedom but its harder to get in to requires a lot of patience.The Roland TR might be good? Its digital but a very good emulation of the TR and TR.,synthesizers,chjuaij,3,t5_2rdyc

Id like it if Moog adopted a similar approach instead of just releasing limited editions with aesthetic differences. For example a limited edition Voyager with builtin ring mod perhaps from the Moogerfooger line or another effect like a phaser or distortion. Or perhaps a Voyager with an extra and different oscillator using the external input on the existing Voyager PCBs. Etc.,synthesizers,choighf,13,t5_2rdyc

1071375,0,t1_chq1k52,If you chiefly wanted the Tempest as a sample machine and you dont want to use a laptop for the job you could use something like an SPSX as a cheap alternative. It only uses samples so its miles away from what the Tempest can offer  but its a reliable straightforward sampler that can fit hours of audio on an SD card.Alternatively an Octatrack will cost a lot more still less than a Tempest but its a fantastic sample machine and a great central controller. You can also have four mono lines going in for effect processing  live sampling.And the Rytm will do what you wanted the Tempest to  play back your own samples and also work as a powerful drum machine. But its not a sampler itself it just plays them back the SP and Octatrack can both sample.Personally I think the Octatrack is an amazing machine but it depends what you want to do. The SP and Rytm would make more sense for triggering samples manually as they have pads. But the OT can do wonderful things via scenes and the crossfader. ,synthesizers,chq2ist,2,t5_2rdyc

1126470,0,t3_270rb2,Here are a few tips for programming.  . First decide how many independent pitches you want ie root note and a fifth or just a root this will decide which algorithm you pick.. Operators with feedback can approximate saw waves.. Carriers modulated by operators with feedback ie  can be more sawlike without noise.. Vary modulator envelope to approximate a LPF.. The more carriers the less complex the timbre.  The more modulators the more complex the timbre.Anyone who says programming a DX is difficult probably hasnt mastered there  points.  Keep one hand on the value slider the other on the selection buttons.A few thoughts on algorithms. Algorithm  is great for pads and Moog style leads.   is also great for leads offset carrier  by ...    Ive used for percussion and very complex sounds.. When in doubt randomize the algorithm!YMMV.

I recently upgraded to an mpc and absolutely love it! Its an inthebox sampler and sequencer with great midi capabilities. Its currently sending a midi clock to my volca keys and acidlab bassline tb clone so they all run in sync. All my drum machines have been multisampled onto the mpc so the whole setup is condensed and portable. My advice would be to get an mpc and have a play around different signal paths with midi sync. The volcas just pick up the midi clock instantly and are great to just pick up and play excellent for some electronic improv kinda stuff. Would love to see some pics of your set up and hear what you can do with it! Good luck,synthesizers,ci29uax,3,t5_2rdyc

1348952,0,t1_cilbkt7,find a nice clean vocal can be from an acapella just has to have good tonal quality or tonal quality you like. Throw it into a sampler and find a bit that you like. Many samplers will allow you to looploop back and forth a small segment and do a sort of granular synthesis kind of bit. Some samplers even have a crossfade option so that the repeating loops dont sound so choppy and fluttery. This will allow a pitch or short sample to sustain.       Make sure glide is turned on to allow you to pitch the note from key to key. From there you can modulate pitch with envelopes or LFOs. ,synthesizers,cildso5,3,t5_2rdyc

While I loved how everything sounded the workflow was a lot more deliberate and different.

So I went to purely DAW which was actually a good idea in my opinion. I needed to focus more on how to construct tracks and songs overall and doing that with easily created virtual synths and organized DAW allowed me to do that.

Even the filter and overdrive with all of its little quirks and inconsistencies just sound so much better to me than the sub which always kind of just sounded too perfect. The sub also kind of sounds a bit harsh and aggressive with a sort of sterile filter sound. I tried so hard to love it ever since I got it back in May of  and dont get me wrong it was pretty cool up until I got the slim phatty last month. I guess ignorance was bliss.  As soon as I heard the slim I was like YES this sounds juicy and so phat. The sub maybe has a bigger lowend but the slim and little phattys midrange are much more enjoyable to my ears. Just check out the video on YouTube comparing the sub vs the little phatty and you can hear the difference. Not to mention I cant stand the under the hood parameters that are impossible to remember without the codes in front of you. People love to say but the plugin... No they should have added a screen...I guess its time to part with my sub phatty and Im definitely not gonna get the sub just because the sound architecture is built upon the sub phatty line which has proven to be very boring to me.

1791158,0,t3_2f0qk9,You get what you pay for. The Microkorg is available almost everywhere and cheaply too especially if you buy it used. Its kind of perverse to expect a  dollar synthesizer to feel like a Minimoog.I dont know about the XL but the standard Microkorgs keyboard is not velocitysensitive. But if you look at the manual you find that the Microkorg will respond to velocity. That opens up some interesting possibilities if you use the MK as a sound module and control it with another MIDI controller or even a sequencer. The MicroKorg is a compromise its small portable cheap and is equipped with a great synthesis engine. It is also somewhat flimsy and assumes that sound design is a separate process from performance.If you can accept the compromises and live with them its quite a lot of sound for the money. If you cant wellyoure going to need to pay more at minimum for an MS. ,synthesizers,ck4xcy9,3,t5_2rdyc

1875074,0,t1_ckf1q0h,The new electribe is totally self contained and you can have  tracks of synthesis. Plus its battery powered when you want it to be so you can write away from the computer. And you can export Ableton format files according to Sweetwaters copy can export each part within a pattern to a dedicated .wav file and generates an Ableton Live Set so you dont even need Ableton to make use of that.I have a Korg EMX and I never really liked the drum channels and would have rather had more synth channels. Well this is exactly what I was hoping they would finally release. And if the synth parts are as flexible as the EMX you can synthesize  tracks of drums no PCM samples. So you could treat it like a  track VA version of a really simplified Tempest.I can seem the comparison to Maschine but its really a totally different type of product to me.I already own a bunch of overlapping gear but the Ableton integration is a total sell for me and if Sweetwaters copy can be believed about the .wav rendering even if I didnt use Ableton itd still be almost exactly as useful.edit I own three Elektron boxes and have already placed a preorder for the electribe because Ive said before the EMX is the most fun  you can spend on a synth and this is an upgrade to everything about the EMX that I found fun. Its not going to be the cornerstone of my studio but its going to be a super fun dedicated box that I can take with me.

I just looked up LaunchPad and while it looks very interesting I am not sure I understand the different modes you can use. I didnt see anything that immediately looked to me like an isomorphic note layout.The Axis is a pretty simple controller in comparison. You have a hex grid of velocity sensitive keys that by default are mapped to a note layout that CThru calls the harmonic table. You can also remap the note layout in software if you like but Im not aware of any software that goes into the kinds of stuff thats possible with a LaunchPad.The biggest advantage the Axis would have over the LP that I can see is the hex grid instead of the square grid. It seems minor but Ive played with both types of layouts on my iPad while I was first looking into isomorphic instruments and almost universally preferred hex grid layouts they just seem to fit the handfingers better. Also velocity sensitivity is important I dont think the LP does that right?,synthesizers,cl62szz,2,t5_2rdyc

2297788,0,t3_2lkmpp,After . years of holding on to the PCBs I finally ordered most of the throughhole components to build my TR drum synth.  I need to decide how I want to enclose the project.  The suggested case is U and for that I can order the premade front panel overlay making it look nice and professional without much effort.  Trouble is that puts the sockets on the back of the case which is not optimal for my setup without adding yet another patchbay and more cables.  Plus having the outs permanently connected to a patchbay would mean I would have no main outs mix at all.   So not sure if I should deal with the outs at the back make a U rack with sockets on the front or a tabletop unit with sockets on the top currently no table space available.  Another consideration is adding mods to the  design.   I dont want to ruin or clutter the available overlay and layout by adding extra features but Id like to have all the features I can....which really suggests I need to go custom and design my own professional looking face.  ,synthesizers,clvq0ce,12,t5_2rdyc

2429436,0,t3_2nage8,Ive been watchingnoticing the steady resale of hybrid devices like the Maschine and Arturia gear and projecting my own feelings supposed that the selling market of such devices is so healthy because like me folks get tired of still having to use the computer after youve forked out for the device...Learning a new control surface is to me way less inviting than learning a new synth and instills a nagging doubt that I just invested in something thats only a marginal improvement on using the mouse  keyboard shortcuts. So much so in fact that Ive now shed all such devices from my setup and while I still use the computer extensively for some projects dont miss the additional interfaces and vastly enjoy the less cluttered work area. Well cluttered with synths instead of USB controllers anyway.I should say that Im not a collector of VSTs either I tend to like a basic DAW so I tend not to like fancy soft synths where graphic design obfuscates use.Now I am an older dude a grumpy old fucker you might say so my mileage is undoubtedly going to differ from some others as I learned all my synthing stuff back when hardware was the only option unless you were financially independent so it may be nostalgia and comfort and all that jazz but Ive now settled on thinking that controllers and hybrid gear are pretty much useless to me unless they are extremely flexible like the monome for instance.Contemplating this after shedding the hybrid gear and my more complex controllers has lead me to realize that Im now no longer so worried about updating my computer as I only have to check my DAW is going to work and not my hardware. That makes me a lot happier. And having the hardware synths while more expensive gives me more satisfaction and inspiration to turn all the gear on and pilot the mothership. So to speak.But I dont suppose Im that unique Ive never been before so I expect theres a bit of a wind blowing in these respects I like stand alone gear I dont mind a little software bonus to enhance certain features but too much reliance on software kills the thrill for me. But I also dont like workstations... Cumbersome beasts with manuals that you can never really learn no matter how hard you intend to ingest that information...

2472641,0,t3_2nv9zq,Synths have never really been huge sellers even today in a music market dominated by electronic music most people still dont even know what a synth is. But everyone knows a guitar or a drumkit. Its fair to say that sales of synths only really peaked once the workstation format was developed because then people who really just wanted to bash out presets would buy them and use them to sequence backing tracks. Even then the Korg M one of the biggest sellers of all time only sold something like a quarter of a million units over  years. Actual synth heads do not exist in big numbers sadly so I think the financial impact was always minimal. I think it might be why the companies making them went for cheaper and cheaper manufacturing the shift to membrane buttons and encoders instead of sliders and knobs digital integrated circuitboards instead of analogue circuitry and less innovation PCM romplers spelled the end for innovative synthesis in hardware until the VA revolution started to happen  and even then it was only pushing simulations of familiar analogue sounds. So its lovely to be in something of a renaissance for synths in general at the moment. I never thought that  years ago Id be the proud owner of three brand new analogue synthesisers bought first hand from shops. It would certainly be interesting to know the sales figures for things like the BS Volcas MS Mini etc to see how many units they are shifting.,synthesizers,cmhbf86,11,t5_2rdyc

Loved deeply by grooveminded musicians the world over these machines have been the beating heart of a wide range of styles including synth pop acid house techno industrial electro and experimental. Now the sound of these classic rhythm machines with every nuance accounted for can be injected into your TR taking the whole experience to an entirely new level.gt Every sound of the TR and TR Rhythm Composers faithfully reproduced using the original PCM wave data and detailed models of the original circuitry. Analog Circuit Behavior captures the unmistakable sound of the original unitsa result of lofi sampling and the behavior of the analog envelope and VCA circuitry design. Newly modified TR kick and snare sounds with enhanced attack characteristics. Five new TR sounds including Noise Toms Noise Clap and Finger Snaps. Unique flam and accent behaviors of the TR and TR with adjustable flam intensity and two levels of accent. Upgrades the TR to have all the sounds and articulations of four iconic TR drum machines plus all new sounds in one performanceready instrument.gtA little historyThe TRs predecessor the TR was developed as an analogdigital hybrid rather than a fully digital device. As memory chips and digitaltoanalog converters were very expensive at the time there was concern that an alldigital design would make the product unaffordable for too many musicians. Also while PCM sound generation could produce more realistic drum sounds it offered little in the way of tone editing.gtAfter the TRs release however digital PCM became the trend for synthesizers and drum machines. We embraced this trend with the TR and TR but expensive memory and lack of highprecision DA converters resulted in a kHz bit or bit for some tones sample playback engine that was primitive by todays standards. Though the TR and TR were developed primarily for rhythm programming and did not give users the ability to edit their sounds they were ultimately appreciated for their characteristic lofi punch and continue to be sought after to this day.gtCapturing the OriginalsEven though the TR and TR were primarily digital devices it would not have been possible to perfectly replicate their sound using samples. Due to the low bitrates of the original units quantization noise became a problem particularly during the sounds decay. To reduce quantization noise a clever design was employed where PCM sound was produced using nondecaying waveforms and decay was then introduced in the analog circuitry after being converted. Also at the time these units were developed deviations in the clock that triggered the PCM caused differences in pitch and deviations in the analog circuitry downstream of the DA converter caused variances in decay characteristics. gtTo replicate these sounds for the TR we started with the original PCM wave data found on the classic machines. We then used our ACB process to completely model the PCM output stage carefully including all of its quirks and instabilities. Modeling the analog envelope and amplifier stages that came after the DA converter allowed us to implement the Tune and Decay parameters that are available on the TR but not present on the original units.gtA seven in your eight  and then someAdding the X Drum Machine Expansion takes the experience of playing a TR to a whole new level. All  original TR and TR soundseach with Tune and Decay controlsopen up a whole world of sonic possibilities. Aside from the original TR and TR sounds the X expansion includes four new neverbeforeheard sounds inspired by the original TR engineers. New TR noise sounds and finger snaps bring ever more tonal variety and newly modified TR kick and snare sounds take the classic combo into new territory with enhanced attack characteristics.gtOnce expanded with the X your TR can have all the sounds of a TR    and morenewly colorcoded by kit for easy selection. And the eight stage flam of the TR and versatile accent behavior of the TR dramatically enhance how you can manipulate the feel of a groove. Any step can have a weak or strong hit a weak or strong accent an adjustable flam step based effects and side chain. All the sounds and behaviors of four iconic TR drum machines plus the TRs own dynamic swing rolls playable faders and acrosstheboard tune and decay controls make the TR the most advanced Roland drum machine weve ever built.gtProduct Outlinegt TR instruments Bass Drum x  Snare Drum x  Low Tom Mid Tom High Tom Open HH Close HH Rim ShotCowbell Hand ClapTambourine Crash Cymbal Ride Cymbalgt TR instruments Hi Bongo Low Bongo Open Hi Conga Mute Hi Conga Low Conga Hi Timbale Low Timbale Long Whistle Short Whistle Hi Agogo Low Agogo Cabasa Maracas Quijada Star ChimegtNew TR sounds  FingerSnap  AttackBD  AttackSD  NoiseClap  NoiseTom L  NoiseTom M  NoiseTom H,synthesizers,cmspu7g,13,t5_2rdyc

All of the SSM and CEM patents expired by the early s.gt I would say the Odyssey would be a tough one simply because Korg will have a current product competing with it and Im sure the patents to go along with it.Korg owns the rights to the Arp brand name but the Odyssey patent expired in  or maybe as late as  if the ARP Odysseys final run included updatednew patent designs.gt A Juno clone is interesting because Roland is still in existence but has yet to produce another Juno with the same architecture. I say if Roland is unwilling to make one then dont stop anyone else from doing so. But I doubt any lawyers involved would have this same view.The patents for the Roland Juno  expired in .

Without it Bitwig Studio wouldnt exist. But while the Session View was loads of fun always when it came down to the nuts and bolts of actually trying to arrange a track the Arrangement View always killed it for.  I just did NOT like it.  It always felt awkard and kinda of halfassed in execution when compared to the Session View.

It seems like the people who are vocally in favor of mini keys would ditch the keyboard altogether if that were the option and people who want keys at all usually want them full size. I understand economies of demand and that too many options splits the market in unfavorable ways but the sole thing that has held me off the ms mini is that the keys are so small and my hands are enormous. I wish they would have given it better MIDI implementation i would get one used hack off the keys mount it in a rack case and call it a day.,synthesizers,cnjxa8l,2,t5_2rdyc

2804714,0,t1_cnmu641,I dont know how to describe my own music but Im interested in creating music that combines elements from my favorite artists and genres namely progpsych jazzfusion postpunk postrock electronic hiphop altindie experimental stuff and possibly musical theater if I can find a way to make it work.On the Prophet Ive replicated Van Halens Jump patch as well as Rushs Subdivisions patch a Tom Sawyer patch comes with the default patches as well as patches for Chameleon by Herbie Hancock In the Cage by Genesis Birdland by Weather Report the sample and hold patch for Karn Evil  st Impression Part  by ELP and other stuff. Its a great sounding synth but I want to move on to making my own sounds not that I wont sample what I made on the Prophet and put it on my Nord!.Yeah Id like to hang on to the LP if I can. It has the CV Out mod so my LPs CV and Gate IO could make for some interesting possibilities when combined with the Pro s CV IO and Gate Out.Could you demo the character section and onboard effects distortion delay feedback etc. a bit monophonically or polyphonically? I dont see enough of them in other demos of the Pro  or Prophet  and Id like to hear them in a more musical setting rather than simply lets crank the decimate knob and listen to the sound crumble. I feel that the demos Ive seen cover how the filter envelopes and modulation can affect how you make a sound but not enough attention is given to these sections beyond a short gimmicky crank of the knob all the way up and I think these sections can really push new sonic territory that other synths cant cover the awesome filter section also opens up more musical possibilities but thats covered heavily everywhere else.,synthesizers,cnmvxa7,2,t5_2rdyc

2830572,0,t1_cnpr5vv,I think its a fair deal given the Moog is coming from a local dealer with a warranty and not sight unseen from some dude on eBay which is the only way Id score one for  less than what Im paying.But yeah its a lot of cash to have tied up in one synth and the size is going to be an issue if I decide to sell it going forward. I guess Im banking on not wanting to sell it. Im hoping it will be like my Tempest something Ill just want to keep around forever. I went and played it some more last night but then I went home and jammed on the Octatrack for a bit. I could part with the Rytm in a second and not regret it one bit. Its a cool machine if youre into techno but pretty forgettable if you like more rock or funk oriented stuff. But the OT is a tougher call for me. Its a complete productivity killer for me but its just so damn fun to play. Perhaps if I was doing live gigs Id feel more satisfied with it.

3081256,0,t1_coh4ycy,Just got home from work and checked web.  I assume you have ver. and have downloaded the system manual.  If not find it hereThe OS manual shows the cable as not TRS but rather a miniAV type like this You can see that if you were to use a normal TRS the CV and GND would be on the same connection.  There is no substitute for using this correct sort of connector.  If you have an miniAV cable one end should look just like the one in the above image which Im gathering you do it should have one white one red and one yellow male RCA on the other end.  The white or red will be Gate the yellow will be CV. Whichever one is not Gate is just dead there is no need to cut the wire.  Have you followed the directions for selecting CV response curve and Gate polarity?edit  reread your original description and realize that you do have the right cable and you are aware of the settings.... the problem is only when hooking up the audio output.... sorry.I guess you were talking about cutting the connection for the audio out in which case if you still have a soldering iron and fancy a strut back to maplins but a stereo cable of whatever size you need and one replacement TR plug.  Cut one end off the stereo cable.  Determine which wire is connected to the tip you might want to do this while still in the store in case you dont have a continuity tester at home.  Slip the sheath of the replacement plug onto the cable!!!  Solder the tip wire to the tip terminal and the ground wire to the ground terminal of replacement plug.  Tape the end of the ring wire enough that it wont short against anything in the plug.  Assemble the plug.  Good to go.  edit   If all that is too much bother you could just get a stereo  or  to dual RCA get one RCA to mono  adapter and leave the ring cable unused.  I was looking at maplins site just now and got fed up but they might even have a Ycable with a stereo TRS to dual mono TR which would be better no adapter.

However Im an old school Roland guy I just cant get enough of that classic s Roland sound. I like the new desktop M w SQ a lot but of course you should demo it inperson and many others. Arturias MiniBrute has mixable waveforms as do the SH and Octave The Cat which for me is a BIG deal.. guessing the MiniBrute v andor fullon Brute isnt too far away from launching.

Id like the other just because I prefer to have an instrument with its own keyboard. It always seems to be a bit better than using MIDI for some reason. Sometimes I get a zippering sound when moving the pitch bend wheel on the controller keyboard connected to the RME by MIDI and I havent found a solution for that yet I havent spent much time looking but I asked in a forum once and they told me what it was.... no clues at all of how to fix it. Thanks guys. I probably wouldnt get that in the keyboard version.But since I dont own the keyboard version I cant make a good comparison.

4322816,0,t1_cscwmgo,This page is pretty decent albeit not very updated theall.orgtxzOther than that I think the key is to not overdo the settings. For example practice using algorithm one and just two operators. Set OP at level  and OP and level  or so and youll have a decent FM sound. Then change the attack on OP to pretty slow same with release. Then change OP so it has the same attack but let it decay slowly afterwards also put the release to like a number slower than the release for OP.Then you should have somewhat of a decent pad that should give some idea of how to do it.Other than that I like to adjust the levels and waveforms of everything before going into the EG settings. Maybe adjust frequencies as well. EG should really be the final shape of the sound that you do. And always go back to the levels afterwards and play around a bit.I think the manual is pretty good as well for understanding the TXz it really is quite a simple synthesizer but with lots of potential. ,synthesizers,cscws3x,5,t5_2rdyc

4400034,0,t3_3bdf5j,I took an electronics class in high school and learned some soldering basics. If youre into synths the skill is invaluable. I wish I was better at it. I would love to learn more about the resistors and capacitors and how to check if they need to be replaced.Ive done several minor repairs on synths and guitars. Its usually something like a cold solder joint. Ive bought synths with minor problems that were easily fixed. My biggest score was a MS where the power would turn on and off randomly. Easy fix. Sometimes gear will be cheaper because buttons dont respond well or they have scratchy knobs.Sometimes you dont need to get out the soldering iron. Last week I fixed a monotribes button that would only respond if you pressed too hard or wiggled as you pressed it. I opened it up and and the component was defective. The electronic component has a stem that gets pushed down by the plastic button on the chassis. That stem was shorter than the others and angled so it barely made contact with the button. I put on a tiny dab of glue and let it dry to give it an extra millimeter of height. Now it works.,synthesizers,cslm9pm,1,t5_2rdyc

5422444,0,t3_3pafel,The arturia CS lets you pan individual voices under the hood the real one might as well but Im not made of money!. Ive got a patch setup thats a duophonic theremin with lots of portamento where every alternating note you play changes panning. As long as you keep simple twonote voicings going over your chord progression you end up with a very cool dualtheremin sound evocative of HTTT era Radiohead. A subtle overdrive and lots of delayverb make it surprisingly vocal. Ive tried to recreate this effect using many other softsynthesizers but its surprisingly difficult to do.One more trick I enjoy using is in NIs Battery where you can use randomization as a modulation source. IMHO every soft synth should have a randomization option as its inherently FUN! Ill take a short sound like a clave or hi hat and randomly vary the panning... or the pitch... or the bitcrushers sample rate. Lots of fun to be had.,synthesizers,cw4rvgh,3,t5_2rdyc

Its a biggitybitch to program from the front panel I never got MIDI Quest to communicate with it properly and the KiwiTechnics hardware patch editor I got to use with it while being a really cool piece of hardware isnt a particularly elegant way to program this synth either.

6474175,0,t3_44au4x,If youre an analogue purist then its obviously a lot cheaper to buy a monosynth but if youre not stuck on the components inside your synth that ceases to be an issue. You can easily pick up absolutely amazing synths like the Alesis Ion Novation Supernova Access Virus Nord Lead  Yamaha ANx for the price of a Moog Sub Phatty or less. They mostly have a choice of mono modes for legato playing single voice or unison. Possibly the only way an analogue mono beats out a virtual analogue poly is in the organic response of the filter resonance in a few specific soundscaping situations but otherwise yeah monos are really only there for sounds with a certain character. Id love an Odyssey for instance because that Odyssey sound is classic and is geared primarily towards mono sounds anyway searing duo leads oddball sound effects etc. But Id always suggest that a monosynth is a second purchase for anyone getting into synths not a first one. A polysynth lets you play chords it lets you play arpeggios it lets you have ringing tails to your sounds that dont vanish the second you play another note. You can record an album with a poly if you use any kind of chords it would take you forever to do that with a monosynth.

We all suffer from it some more than others and we all have different ways of dealing with it.though some people are just filthy rich I went the route of buying one high end piece of gear for each category of utility to focus my lust and build something that would in effect act like a single instrument capable of everything. I took it slow one at the time.. so I had the time to figure each piece out in depth... after I got the Nord Electro I didnt buy anything but a looper pedal for . years because I was focusing on learning the piano. I look back and realize it has worked well. My setup is now completed An electric guitar and amp a powerful and versatile mono synth a bitimbral poly synth with unlimited possibilities a rompler for acoustics and a brain for looping sampling sequencing effects drums and arrangement. For me... Its perfect.........ok... Maybe a microphone and a vocal processing unit... then it would be complete...And a vocoder of course. I also really should get myself a DAW and audio interface so I can start getting some tunes out there if I dont just skip the audio interface and get that new soundcraft Mtk mixer instead.

6705361,0,t1_d0cgwua,gt When you mix the two channels by plugging both stereo ends into the same channel or using a converter its sort of adding the two signals together and theyre going to cancel out in some really unhelpful ways.Specifically a lot of gear will interpret mono with a TRS jack as a balanced signal where the two channels are the same but are transmitted with one side phase inverted. The idea is that one side is inverted in the receiving device before the signals are combined and then the noise cancels out. But the volcas send dual mono  a stereo signal with the same signal on both sides. Plug them into a device that expects a balanced mono signal and its the signal thatll cancel out. So you should run them into a stereo channel or use a stereogtdual mono converter and then leave one side unplugged.,synthesizers,d0cw4s7,7,t5_2rdyc

The only disadvantage to DIY is everything arriving at different times  it always seems like you need one more part to finish the project. I also have extra copies of some PCBs I had printed myself in China like the Turing Machine Befaco Even VCO some logic modules... Living in Hong Kong is turning out to be a huge advantage for DIY because I can get PCBs printed and source components for a fraction of what people pay in the West. After Ive tested everything and feel happy with my setup Im going to be selling off some stock of either parts PCBs kits or finished modules and then I might actually be making a profit on my eurorack rather than letting it drive me into crushing debt.

6802458,0,t3_48inq7,gt How is synth music typically transcribed? I suppose standard eastcoast style VCOVCFVCA synthesis you just use traditional sheet music and treat the synth like an ordinary piano. Opening up a filter or shortening decay could just be noted down with annotations. There are no standards that I know off.For westcoast ... the very idea of transcribing seems a bit odd to me ... It doesnt have a tempo or a meter the notes do not have fixed frequencies or lengths and the entire thing has no fixed structure. I dont see how you could transcribe it because it doesnt have any rules that it plays by. You can google for experimental sheet music to get an idea of how people are trying to deal with this. I dont think the focus is on being able to faithfully reproduce a piece of music from such a score.

Moreover all over the western world beginners are taught triads this way and it does seem to work. Even wikipedia explains triads this way.

7234364,0,t3_4eaa10,gtHow do you go about making patches? It varies everytime. I usually start with a clock source or with a basic oscillator into my mixer and then add parts in betweenbesidearound. gtHow much modulation do you use? Lol wot? How could I even quantify that. Unless Im making a stable drone that only ever changes when I turn knobs it has some modulation... usually a lot. Id guess that my average patch has at least  cv inputs being utilized with the more complex ones having well over  cv inputs utilized.   gtAre clocked sequencers a huge part of the modular experience for you?For me yes they are. But I think its important to remember a clock source doesnt need to be stable! It need not be a square wave LFO a.k.a. a standard clock. Instead I often clock my sequencers with more complex rhythms. For example imagine a bar consisting of  beats. You can have the sequencer move forward every single beat but thats simple and gets boring. Instead perhaps have the sequencer only move forward on     and .  This way the sequencer moves  steps per  beat bar instead of  step per  beats. This is fun because now the sequence wont just repeat the same stuff each bar it will need to reach a common multiple first before it repeats ontime together. Look mom polyrhythms! You can also have the envelope controlled VCA not triggered by the clock out of the sequencer to make things even more complicated. So instead of one simple note for step you could have like ... or have it change depending on something else.  gtDo you use your modular system alone or combine it with other gear? Yes haha. I do both but the more I get familiar with modular the more I enjoy modular only patches and songs.gtDoes your semimodular take center stage in your setup or is it a piece you use when you want that sort of sound?No it doesnt take center stage at all. I have a pitts synth box and usually just use it for its components lfo filter vca etc now... unless I happen to want all of it in the same prepatched order unlikely. gtWhat are your tips and tricks for modular synthesis? I want to joke and say dont do it but honestly... you should do it. It forced me to rethink so much about my approach synthesis and I feel I am a better sound designermusician even on nonmodular synths because of it. gtParticular patching ideas? Ill share two pretty simple sequencer ones that new modular users might not have tried yet. Firstly try use sequencers as oscillators when clocked at audio rates. Secondly try using a sequencer as a clock divider. gtCombining multiple synthesis methods in interesting ways?All the different synthesis methods just blur together for me in modular land.   ,synthesizers,d20ht9u,3,t5_2rdyc

7332859,0,t3_4fheho,I am in the analog synth restorationsales business and here are my observations.  I have seen a lot of synths that people have purchased on Ebay over the years.  There are basically two types of sellers of these instruments People who are really serious about these maintain their instruments and have them restored and then people who dont .  The instruments that I would pay more for are the ones where the owner can list off all of the work and maintenance that has been done.  Beware of the sellers who say Ive had it for  years and its mint. This is almost never the case if the seller cant list off specific work that has been done. A Mini that has had no maintenance will typically need new key bushings and will have at least a handful of random electronic issues.  That said Moog gear seems to stand the test of time a lot better than many of their competitors from that time period polymoog excluded from that statement.  There arent a lot of polarized caps in the Mini which is nice.  Id say if youre buying one that has good looking wood has new key bushings power supply has been rebuilt various electronic issues addressed by a pro then  would be the highest Id go.  If you go this route definitely ask for a list of the work.  I find that there are a lot of people who have an old Mini sitting around then they see one listed on Ebay for k and think that theirs must be worth that even though theirs has dirty bus bars old bushings doesnt tune and all of the pots are scratchy.  I would say that you should always ask these things if buying a Mini on EbayAre the key bushings original?  Have the bus bars been cleaned and polished?  If not there will be lots of intermittent key contacts in most cases.Are any of the pots and switches scratchy?Do the oscillators all tune?Has the unit been calibrated? What serviceupgrades has the unit had?  Power supply rebuild replace original opamps polarized capacitors general maintenanceDoes every function work correctly?I usually use these points to talk a person down as well especially if their asking price is the same as a Mini that had been restored by a pro.   I guess my short answer is  on the low end and  for a restored one.  Some might go for k but thats pretty high and rare. If you get one thats beaten up Id expect the bill to be  to give it a general rebushbus bar polishfix all issues by a pro.  Maybe more if the thing is in terrible electronic shape as well as mechanical shape.  Only pay a lot for one that needs nothing.,synthesizers,d2bp25f,2,t5_2rdyc

7351543,0,t1_d2dre4c,You got the right idea of the structure.  Jazz is typically a headsoloshead format with variations on intros and outros. head means melody or theme and it usually has a harmonic foundation underneath which becomes the basis of the solos. So in reality there actually is a harmonic loop. You solo using the same harmony that the melody is based off of.  If the head is a  bar AABA tune then that  bar cycle is a chorus and you solo over one or more choruses and the next player gets a shot and the next and finally you play the head out.  Even the drum solos can be in this  bar format.  Check out this short Monk tune and I think you can hear what I mean as the harmony is relatively easy to pick out and Monk sticks fairly close to the melody in his solo spot. Its all theme and variations straight up classical composition techniques being applied in a improvised format. Of course not all jazz is  bar. It can be   ... whatever.  Sometimes theres little or no harmonic movement or form or groove sometimes its totally free skronking.  The key ingredient is group improvisation.  Musicians counting off and going listening intently communicating and creating a unique musical moment every time.  Throw in the energy and interaction from the audience in the room and you have a very dynamic and flexible music.  There is no changing of midi notes and pouring over knobs no rewinding and finishing tomorrow  theres only the note and you have got to be ready to commit yourself to the music and the moment at hand. Its a beautiful thing. ,synthesizers,d2dtjfr,1,t5_2rdyc

7451340,0,t3_4hdggb,Id go with the Keys. The Monotrons are fun but dont give you much as far as synthesis goes not to mention being very difficult to play without a stylus of some sort. The keys gives you more sound editing options and midi control plus a delay and a pretty good sequencer. Plus you can expand your volca collection down the road and have them sync with eachother really easily. The Monotrons are a great bit of fun but thats kind of it they really arent as in depth or engaging as any of the volcas. You would more than likely get bored with them after a while unless you REALLY like drones.   If you havent looked at the other Volcas do some research on those as well because your probably wont find anything better for . If you want a cheap analog subtractive synth Id say the Keys is a fine choice. However the sample is probably the most versatilefunbangforyourbuck member of the volca family and the FM easily has the most soundcreation potential although its FM so there WILL be a learning curve. I dont feel strongly about the Beats or Bass although I know some people here prefer the Bass over the keys so it might be worth looking into.    TLDR  Keys for days,synthesizers,d2p6582,3,t5_2rdyc

7454444,0,t3_4hatf7,Some of the more obvious ones are to make weird evolving pads especially setting the envelopes of each CZ line to different settings or creating pseudoLFOs.One of the more interesting uses I came up for the stage envelope is for synthesizing a clap. A good clap is typically imitating the sound of several people clapping in unison and thus can be hard to synthesize on a more conventional synth since theres not often a way to create multiple impulses in rapid succession. With the CZ you can have each line attack multiple times very quickly before becoming a more typical perfusion sound which gives that good thwhack sound you want from a clap. One of my favorite claps is a really hollow and dry one I coaxed from my CZ.Overall just play with it. If nothing else it gives finer control over traditional envelope shapes than is normally possible but if you think outside the box a little it becomes a really useful sound design tool. Its by far the most complex part of the CZ engine so you have to take advantage of it to really squeeze the best most unique sounds from your CZ.Other synths with multistage envelopes.... Try looping them for really crazy LFOs. Try assigning them to nonVCOVCFVCA destinations like LFO speed.,synthesizers,d2piu61,1,t5_2rdyc

There is a pitch alteration effect too that changes pitch without changing length. For longer samples its good for straight playback but the start and end point edit is super annoying for anything better than short samples as it only moves in the millisecond range.

Now fullsize weighted keys in a small powerful package is also not that common as far as I can tell. But there is a middle ground. I would suggest looking at microbruteminibruteminlogueJDXImicrokorg. Those are all smallISH and portable if you are committed. If you want to be able to play more than one note at a time ignore the brutes those are mono. If you stick to the others youll be able to at learn keys with those play chords learn some synthesis and make cool weird sounds. I have some guesses of what kind of job youre talking about and if you really do have hours of down time a day I personally would think the size of these would not be a deal breaker especially if you drive yourself to work.

7811376,0,t1_d3smiig,Pretty much sometimes they are on XLR sometimes .  So a mixer is going to have its main output which you can plug into a PA for live performance into your audio interface for the computer into a recorder into studio monitors many mixers have a separate Monitor Out or Control Room Out specifically for studio monitors or really into just about anything you need its the main output.  Subs are simply extra outputs.My mixer Behringer Xenyx QXUSB has two sub outs on unbalanced  jacks.  When I push a button Sub on the channel strip it sends that channel to both sub outs I can pan hard left or right to only send the channel to one of the outputs.  I have separate faders for the sub outs and I can choose to leave the subbed tracks in the main mix or take them out of it. I leave my sub outs connected to my sampler inputs so if I want to sample a synth I just push the Sub button to send just that synth to the sampler and set the level with the fader.  Thats only one use you could send one or multiple channels to their own inputs on an audio interface say for recording a separate stereo mix of drums of pads or to isolate the bass to its own mono track or when using the mixer for live sound you could set up two mono monitor mixes for the performers on stage.

8039239,0,t3_4p2zlp,A while ago I implemented patch interpolation morphing from one patch into another for the JXP. I did it in python.Basically I used it by plugging in a usbmidi adapter into the JXP plugging in a midi controller to the computer to control the python script and use any knob on the midi controller to morph between two patches. The script listens to the midi controller and dispatches midi data to the jxp.heres a short crappy video i posted demonstrating it heres the github repoThis patcher script can also randomize patches and you can even interpolate between those two random patches to get some really crazy results.just PM me if you need any help getting it to work. EDIT oh shit I just realized this could be used to easily map a regular midi controller to the JXP sysex parameters. people were talking about using a BCR controller earlier but only because it can send sysex. this patcher script would be able to map any incoming CC command from any midi controller to the JXP sysex commands!,synthesizers,d4jop62,2,t5_2rdyc

They know most people who purchase a Volca wont also have a midi keyboard or hardware sequencer or something. They are cheap and they assume the buyers of them will be on the very low end. So there was no way to implement velocity with the stylophonetype touch strip keyboard that is built in. I agree that it could have been added for midi and it may be added in a future firmware release but as others have said there are software and hardware solutions for the velocity and I think this is great as its encouraging the end users to get creative a little bit.

Theyd need to shake off that heritage fully if they want folks to move away from the negative perception they have. Particularly among live sound professionals and studio based audio engineers. The X is still not that universally liked by engineers theres plenty of folks dont like the way it sounds... Though I think its slightly a case of kicking back against the tsunami sized tide of enthusiasm everyone else has for it because audio engineers are often a crotchety bunch.I think what they are managing to do though is seed positive perception among the next generations of home producers small touring bands and musicians.Ive been a long time detractor of Behringer myself  but I now find that exactly as Ive stated here I have to concede that Behringer have some good products now.

8525910,0,t1_d6778uf,Exactly im not qualified to offer an opinion on the technical aspect of this discussion but the sound of a filter is almost infinitely variable by its own settings and by modulation etc. I have the Karp Odyssey and can generally say that each one has its own overall character but an AB test is kind of pointless because filter settings are not recipes. Maybe filter one sounds better at  open and resonance at  but maybe filter two is better at  open and resonance at . But this also depends on what waveforms are feeding it and whether the oscs are synced or detuned or if the LFO is this many hertz and at what intensity not to mention envelope and eg intensity. And whether I just want resonance to add some subtle bite or not so subtle harmonics.  You cant tell any of this from doing filter sweeps at various settings.

8579623,0,t1_d6dxwbx,Something isnt right here either your explanation my interpretation of your explanation or my understanding of tracking.  Im not sure I understand your settings filter V.  Allow me to rephrase and give my version of results Press a key equal to V cutoff slider adds another V to the sum.  With tracking at  pressing that key equals VfC.   Playing one octave higher adds another V from tracking so fCV.  Play one octave lower fCV.  In these actions the cutoff knobslider doesnt move only the tracking changes the cutoff frequency. With tracking at  cutoff slider still at V pressing the V key adds V so fCV.  Playing Oct higher V would add .V so fC becomes .V.  Playing one lower V adds .V for .V.  This doesnt make it so lower notes are brighter higher notes more dull.  It just makes it so higher notes arent as bright as when set to  but still brighter than the lowest octaves.  In order to make lower have a higher cutoff than higher notes you must invert the key track signal so the higher you play the lower the cutoff.  ,synthesizers,d6e1d5t,2,t5_2rdyc

I also dont recall the MS Mini having CV gate in. I could be wrong there but I remember noticing this when I last was checking them out.The Minibrute has literally nothing as far as protection for the CV gate ins and again tons of people have ruined their brutes just this way. Grounding issues voltage issues etc. There is a mix of official info as well nothing in the manual on specs for valid ranges which is bad and then there are claims that it is vv vv and even vv. But known issues with negative and higher voltages that dont cause damage when used briefly but do with prolonged use. Releasing a proper specrange would have been a good start.

8846174,0,t3_51dka0,I can only comment on the ESX and EMX since those are the ones Im familiar with I own an EMX. The EMX is the more powerful external sequencer because it can sequence  parts compared to  on the ESX. Parts are important on old Electribes because the sequencers are monophonic so the workaround to get polyphony is to use multiple synth parts on the same MIDI channel. All other internal sequencing features pattern length arpeggiator etc are identical as far as I know.That being said the EMX is not really a drum synth since the synth part synthesis options are quite limited and the builtin drum sounds are sampled. To my ear the drum samples and effects have a certain lofi digital vibe to them which may or may not be what you want. To work around this limitation I got a Retrokits RK cable to use with a Volca sample which is sequenced as a synth part on the EMX.On the other hand the ESX supports some neat slicing and stuttering features which you might need and lets you load custom samples. I am not too familiar with the ESX but ultimately it depends on what you like best. Id recommend playing around with both and seeing what you like  the UIs on the EMX and ESX are virtually identical so if you learn to use one you already know how to use  of the other.,synthesizers,d7b6nvh,5,t5_2rdyc

8897668,0,t3_524r1j,Not to be rude but just checkingDo you understand whyhow what they are claiming is conceptually and fundamentally different from most virtual analog systems and traditional DSP do?Because while none of us knows exactly what Roland has gotten up to  there are a few very clear differences in method approach and computational complexity.In short Traditional VA uses DSP methods to manipulate sound forms. Instead of using some complicated custom designed circuits to e.g. filter sound they look at the discrete time series and do math directly on that. All this is to make a thing that does the same highlevel processing that an old analog would do but for various reasons the naive approach is not that great. People have gotten better and better over the years.In contrast ACB is or seems to be claiming to be a physicsbased model of the actual resistors and capacitors in one of their old synths. Done naively and in high fidelity this is extremely computationally complex especially done with audio rates.So no its not just marketing insofar I believe that what they say is very different from what others have done. It is not clear that there is any objective test of fidelity but all subjective reports are that the ACB is some of the best emulation of analog synthesis every sold on a mass market. And I dont think its a big stretch to think it sounds better because they have some clever physics models and some great timeoptimized computation. N.b. this is my undertanding Im happy to be corrected. I am relatively new to synths as a musical hobby but have been familiar with computational complexity DSP and mathematical modeling for a long time in other contexts.  ,synthesizers,d7hdeyv,11,t5_2rdyc

From The Quietus   Rural England we have to hope is full of people like Neil Mortimer and Michael J York AKA The Other Without going about their daily business before going home drinking strange teas and donning robes of ancient cloth to summon the land into unusual transcendental music. Mortimer and York have pedigree with this sort of thing after all  the former has collaborated with Julian Cope while York builds his own pipes and other instruments having blown them with Coil Cyclobe Urthona and The Stargazers Assistant who themselves have an excellent album out that Russell Cuzner reviewed in Rum Music here.The Other Without though is a far different beast three sumptuously evolving tracks made from old synthesisers perfectly meshed with field recordings of water birds and leaves  these we are told were made at magical confluences hidden waterfalls and enchanted shores. The result recorded under the watchful tower of Glastonbury Tor is absolutely fantastic to write to or to take up to rolling downland as the autumn sky rolls into fire and the hollows in the slopes fill themselves by drinking deep of the night. The Ocean Is Indiscrete sounds like universeweary visitors from another dimension landing on a Dorset beach after a voyage of a length beyond our comprehension. Earthstar Transmitter follows on by eddying the synths like waves stroking back the sand and pebbles unto the end of time before a quietly determined rhythm gradually appears and a simple piano refrain.

Ive given it plenty of time to warm up in each instance although it generally doesnt change much after a minute or so.I agree that the inconsistency makes it hard to blame on resistors that measure consistently be they right or wrong. It also sounds like capacitors generally go bad in synths more often than other things.

Again  I generally like your videos especially how you go into detail over things most reviews will just briefly touch. Even if some elements of them can be offputting. Dont let the haters err yeah like me get to you!gt  oscillators? Like thats not something? Im not even a polyphonic fan... but that IS something.I mean true  VCOs is definitely something  but its only  more than some of the most classic analog polys.gt Have you ever seen how even with three partials the shape of a saw can become apparent?Yeah I have. Have you ever listened to it? It may look a bit like a sawtooth but it doesnt sound like one. Have you ever tried a sawtooth drawbar setting on a Hammond organ? A Hammond is technically an additive synth too  but even with  partials every sound still just ends up sounding like an organ. Not that sounding like an organ is a bad thing nothing else comes close to the scream of a Hammond through a Leslie  its just nothing like the additive synthesis in a Fairlight CMI or Synclavier.Besides having lots of partials one of the key elements of classic additive synthesis is that the mix of partials can be changed over time to give evolving timbres beyond what you can get with a VCF the Memorymoog cant do that other than by twisting knobs while you play which a polysynth isnt exactly conducive to.Anyway I dont fault you over getting excited by these things! The Memorymoog is an incredible synth! When its working anyway.  VCO per voice is pretty great!Now back to making synths in my spare time.

9430625,0,t3_59ug8c,Well if your analog synths dont have MIDI in then yeah you have to play them with a click track as many times as need till you get it right.

Select the input of your interface where your synth is and record with Edison or record into the playlist with the big red record button next to the play one.Here you will find more info on plugging them in As for the last question you would need a click track and do it live.

I am interested in making krautrockelectronicambientshoegaze type stuff specifically.I have been looking at a few different pieces of gear for this an OP Electribe  Sampler a Roland SPSX and a Novation Circuit.  I realize these are all quite different pieces of gear so let me give you a sense of what seems appealing about them and if you have experience with them please let me know if you think it would suit my interests.  I would also like to build drumbeats on this as well and sell the Volca just to streamline things a bit.The OP seems cool because its sort of an end to end product.  It is quite expensive though and based on what Ive heard its not all that great for recording audio via line in I would want to record the Sub  and Minilogue in this way.  Im leaning away from this one at this point.The Electribe  Sampler seems good in many aspects but Ive heard the polyphony isnt great and there are voice stealing issues and weird gaps when switching between parts  this sounds pretty annoying and makes it a lot less appealing.The Circuit seems like a decent option but it looks pretty limited as a sampler.  There is only like a minute of recording time to work with.Im probably mostly leaning towards the SPSX.  The long recording time and effects are appealing and it seems to be something of an industry standard.  Is it possible to apply an effect to something youre playing live via an input or do you need to record a sample before you can apply effects?I appreciate any and all advice on this  apologies for the longwinded and meandering post.,synthesizers,d9tix17,3,t5_2rdyc

Im not a purist if machines whose the signal is not analog would give me the same as my analog gear incl. affordable machines like the ones mentioned I would not stay aways from them. Just like any other musician using analog gear that I know. Of course its not inherently true for digital synths to be somewhat different but there are many reasons they are and will likely stay. It makes absolutely no sense for a manufacturer to produce a Minibrute or Dark Energy as a digital synth and go for the exact same sound and functionality. Thats a nightmare.Its definitely miscommunication or youre just backpedalling now.

9681672,0,t3_5dpx56,I would say if youre dead set on continuing work in Ableton and already have the basic keyboard setup get the Push . There is no better way to interface with that program. Once you get into Elektron or similar groovebox territory youll never want to go back to the computer. And eventually you or your wallet or your studio space will start to feel the limitations of a hardware setup. Too often will I latch on to a new hardwarebased idea then find myself wishing I had another delay pedal or another compressor or more room on my mixer for these individual outs  whereas its just a click away in a DAW environment.Can also skip the outboard synth for similar reasons. VAdigital already perfected in software.. analog is going to be limited either by polyphony or overall sonic flexibility also governed by budget.On the other hand if you dont feel my issue of limitations applies to your workflow or budget... Get the Octatrack Analog Rytm and Analog Keys. Youll also need an Analog Heat for each one possibly even one for each individual output. And you might need a backuppoly synth so grab a Prophet  or Yamaha Montage. Also better get an actual TB spring for the devilfishtrust me and whichever TR drum machine suits your aesthetic. And youll need at least one Sherman filter Ekdhal Moisturizer a couple Moogerfoogers a handful of FMR RNC amp RNLAs and of course a huge mixer with lots of busses.

Lately Ive been reading Composing Electronic Music by Curtis Roads lt and as I go a lot of ideas pop into my head so I write them down. I then setup a blank project in the OT and try to make that idea work in the most general sense set some trigs and put some noise into it which leads to changing around how I got things setup and start again. This almost always leads to a very different end result than what I had originally in mind of course which is fine by me. Once I have a nice configuration I treat that project as an instrument and try to find and refine ideas. Eventually I get sick of it or dont find it too inspiring anymore so I switch to some other idea on the list and start again.

If youre a newbie and you dont know these things just be straight up and ask. We all are pretty much friendly on this sub. Being a Minilogue owner myself I tend to write sequences either in my DAW or on an Electribe  and send the MIDI info to the Minilogue. I do this for live jamming and composing because the onboard sequencer is limited for note input but great for Motion Record. Alternatively sometimes I just have the Minilogue setup to design patches. Sometimes Ill come up with a riff and Ill play with the onboard step sequencer. Then I hit play and record the output in my DAW. Hope that helps and ask away any other Minilogue related stuff its a great piece of gear. ,synthesizers,dagrohp,2,t5_2rdyc

If you want to hear a majestic synth check out the Korg Wavestation.While the Prophet is well placed in your list it inspired the PPGs about as much as they influenced everybody else which is to say that the Ps themselves are derivative. Some would say the P is comparable to a polyphonic Odyssey or maybe a  osc Moog but you dont even mention the king of all synth makers and his osc megamonster Minimoog.DK Synergy?

Wendy Carlos has a reputation with the instrument but hasnt allowed her works on the thing to endure long out of print and she hunts down unauthorized copies of her works which is just about all of them now.

MPCs still are probably the best overall because you can sample and have  tracks but add in the synth functions polyphony and ppqn of an EMU into an MPC and it would dance circles around an Octatrack or Toraiz.

10381861,0,t3_5oofk1,The Monologue and the Minilogue are part of the same family but are quite different synths with different strengths that go far beyond just the size of the keyboard. To start the Minilogue is polyphonic meaning you can use it to play multiple notes at the same time chords. The Minilogue is monophonic meaning it plays one note at the time. Monophonic synths are mostly used for bass lines leads and effect sounds.The Minilogue has a sort of dreamy sound and is very suitable for genres like trance synthwave ambient etc. while the Monologue is more aggressive sounding and suitable for techno industrial etc. Of course this doesnt mean either synth is restricted to these genres but they have character associated with them.

10423722,0,t3_5p2sp1,I am learning piano at the moment. Initially I wanted to learn romantic stuff but that shit is time consuming as fuck so now I just improv and do jazz. You need piano action to learn piano. My  advice is to get an electric piano I have a Roland f but you should get one with better midi out. Use the piano as a controller for soft synths  get kontact or free VSTs or maybe spectrasonics keyscape gassing over that. I have a microkorg xl and you cannot enjoy playing piano on it the keys are way too small and the action is while better than everything else at that price point still spongey and horrible.Also you deffo want  keys otherwise you might as well just get a small poly synth and use a sequencer for all the use itll be to you.,synthesizers,dcpljbf,1,t5_2rdyc
10428075,0,t3_5pb7td,Experiment! Even if you dont understand some things just yet playing around will teach you.Experiment with synths download lots if you can afford to buy some cheap ones turn their knobs patch their cables virtually or physically. If you dont like them you will be able to resell them for not much less. Experiment with recordings in the field run all of it through delays reverbs pitch shifters and other FX you run across.And if you appreciate a specific suggestion Im not a software guy in the hardware world I like the Korg MS mini  used a lot for experimental music. And the Digitech Polara  used is an incredible reverb vor long ambient trails. If you get hardware you will basically need an interface andor a small mixer depending on how you plan to route the audio paths and of course speakers... Since you will use your computer you will definitely use it for more effectssounds and to record sequence and arrange your tracks. So not necessarily hardware needed for those things though a hardware sequencer or even a cheaper synth like the Korg Volca Keys  used sounds great too IMO that has a sequencer already can be incredibly inspiring  for some people like me its way more productive to have an immediate physical experience others prefer to have everything in the computer and use a mouse or a controller.These three two together can have very warm smooth tones or sound super dirty noisy. Plus basslines drums pads and everything inbetween. The patchpoints on the MS are great for trying new routings and learning analog synthesis plus the entire interface is very fun and inspiring.Generally I live gear with CV patchpoints semimodular mostly analog synths and Eurorack gear plus some effects like Moogerfooger pedals. But this can get very expensive very quick.EDIT Another small suggestion Dont underestimate monosynths. A lot of people only go for polyphonic synths and want to be able to play chords. Especially in experimental ambient music however single notes are super important. And you will tend to program them to be fat and rich in harmonics and evolving and these type of tones are usually great in mono not so much in poly mode. The MS and many cheaper aned expesnive ones as well analog synths are only monophonic.,synthesizers,dcq3acy,3,t5_2rdyc

Global effects  reverb and delay  you can only choose factory presets of these effects  however the send amt can be adjusted for each track  Can record automation  Each track has  macro knobs that can be assigned to any programmable parameter of that voiceAnd here are my hopes and dreams of the future of Circuit  Panning  I want to be able to pan each individual track both the synths and samples  this should be possible as the device is obviously stereo the chorus of each voice is stereo as well as the global reverb and delay are both stereo.  Patterns longer than  steps  Non quantized recording  currently all recording is quantized to the  steps of the current tempo.,synthesizers,dcx9pdf,3,t5_2rdyc
10491490,0,t1_dcx7id3,God that must have taken an eternity. Great work. Although maybe it would be a good idea to eventually replace the solderless breadboards with something more permanent and durable...gtAre the pure stable beatless intervals of just intonation at odds with a certain popular aesthetic of what a synth is expected to sound like with LFO modulation and warbly detuned oscillators and nonharmonic timbres?Not necessarily although a tonal system with better intonation than  equal maybe deserves to be treated in a way that takes advantage of its assets. Im not really sure whether or not the composer has a duty to make it obvious to the listener what kind of temperament is being used but very detuned and modulated sounds seem to make the difference less obvious. Which if you think about it is a large part of why things like vibrato are common to begin with. Its a way to mask intonation errors.I do stuff with just intonation and other temperaments typically in software Pure Data but sometimes also using ordinary hardware synthesizers. ,synthesizers,dcxbjz2,7,t5_2rdyc

Its crazy when it comes to flexibility and modulation. The Minibrute is also a really innovative synth itself. If you havent played one I suggest doing so. Arturia might be bad at some things but they are not being lame when it comes to creative analog gear. I dont know anything else that sounds like them and lets you do the same things.Im not a big fan of the logues but Korg rereleased the MS. Granted its been there for ages but its incredibly affordable now and its a very very deep synth. If you find it boring I dont know what will excite you. The patching is super versatile the external signal processor is unmatched.Then there is the coast. Doepfer brought out the Dark Energy and the Dark Time. MFB made the Dominions.Vermona Perfourmer MK. Have you seen the possible interactions between the four voices? Holy moly this is one  fascinating machine and not something you have every heard before.Moog brought out the Moogerfooger line incl. the CP. All ov those have plenty of CV patching options. The possibilities within this line of machines alone are amazing  and then you can actually connect it to all that other gear sporting CV ins and outs. This lets you do a lot of weird stuff. And its very inspiring. And they made the Mother too.Dreadbox Kilpatrick GRP etc... Listing all those manufactures Im surprised myself right now how many of those are being really really cool when it comes to developing new things and fantastic signal path options.Have I listed Elektron already???All of this is analog Im not even gonna start with digital gear popping into the equation and getting patched up with analog components.And then there is Eurorack. But at this point I dont even think I have to go on and list details. But just take a look at modules like Mutable Instruments Clouds Frames Warps or Tides. Or Make Noise Maths. Or Intellijel gear MalekkoWiard even the Roland modules are really deep and really fun to play with in new ways.Yes its become boring to play with a simple substractive analog mono synth that doesnt have CV patching or a lot of modulation routes.

I wonder if that had something to do with the voice chips? The modulation was one of the things that threw me off.gt In any case pretty impressed by the System .  threw me for a loop. I feel like I can still trust my ears I just need to give digital emulations a fair shake.gt Would love to hear the Jupiter plug out if you have it.Theres a noise control.  It can get MUCH noisier.  That was setting  of .  I thought about making A even noisier to throw people off but then I decided it would be better to just match it as closely as possible.Im not really sure I just set the modulation up like my System  patch.  It didnt react quite the same way so I had to adjust.  It has  dead voice chips now and literally died right after I made the recording so who knowsI have the Jupiter plugout but I dont have a real Jupiter to compare the plugout against.

I was going to sell it but decided to give it one last go. It turned out a bug was introduced by one of the OS updates and stuck around for a while that was specific to working at k and greatly exacerbated the clicks and pops and gone braindead issues. Which they fixed at some point while mine was inert.I think theres more going on with its problems than just the TI by itself. From working with it since getting it back Ive noticed its much more stable if I stay away from the fancypants oscillator modes and stick to classic DCOs. I also keep the delay reverb and EQ turned off I do all that stuff in my DAW anyway. If youre using a PC I believe a dedicated USB card for it is a must. All the Macs Ive used it with have had one USB bus that doesnt share a hub with anything that have been ok the bandwidth of USB should be sufficient for what it does but theres some additional eyeofnewt hardware stuff relating to it that I cant recall right now which I believe triggers the fuck off I refuse to share a bus dialog even if youre plugging it into a Thunderbolt port via an adaptor. My suspicion is theres something in there that cant juggle the number of balls its expected to that the TI really stresses and cant be patched around for whatever reason thats either clocking or bussing related.I dont use presets so the TI is pretty much a requirement for me and Ive ripped out more hair than I can recount over this beast.

The mixer is a great tool to do the routing. Alas you cant route many to many as you wish plus the feedback loop possibilities with having  to  in outs out of every dawsampler today... sooner or later youll get a cheap mixer and find the practicallity about it. One of them being settings levels of volume for recording different instruments without having to find the right volume each time on each instrument  which might happen if you had to plug in and out for each track.Hope it helps  im sure this is just the tip of the iceberg.

Anytime Tats spoke here or elsewhere it was newsworthy and he wasnt the CEO of Korg. People can bag on Uli or Behringer thats fine but the guy seems to genuinely care about his company employees and he wants some of these synths as bad as many of us. In his position rather than shell out s of thousands of dollars or more on some of these classics he can prototype and build them himself and possibly release them for others in the same boat. Why wouldnt he? I would do the same thing.

11426464,0,t3_6313ap,I have a flute background a synth middle ground and now a piano foreground     I had classical flute training from age  then I discovered that flute took two hands but playing a flute patch took one hand leaving a hand for chords or handling groupies...    For  years I played synth keys then a few years ago I decided I wanted to be a drunk jazz pianist in my s. Basically I just wanted to be able to sit down at a piano and play something without the help of the battlestation. And if that was going to be the case then Id better get on with it. The drunk part took a while but eventually sorted that.    So for the last  years or so Ive been learning classical piano from the bottom up. Its hard work and requires lots of grinding and the progression curve isnt at all linear but it is rewarding. Im still crap but I can play stuff! And I can play double handed scales and shit like that.    The discussion on whether this helps or hinders synth technique isnt going to end anytime soon  and I rather think that organ technique is a little more applicable  but I certainly enjoy the rewiring of my brain thats going on.

The HPF is nice to remove low end but I dont see it as much as a character builder rather as a utility. There are tons of great plugin filters and EQs with lots of personality. Id rather save money on my keyboard and use a separate EQ or filter the remove unwanted low end. ,synthesizers,dfz2wlb,5,t5_2rdyc

11556042,0,t3_64x29e,Fellow circuit owner here. To get the most out of the circuit as far as learning music I would get a midi keyboard with midi IO such as something in the Alesis q line or a used maudio axiom. This will allow you to control the synths with a real Keybed. Then if you press or hold down the scale button and press the bottomright pad it changes to chromatic scales so it is not choosing the right notes for you. That is your basis for learning how to play it as an instrument and practice is the final step. Synth one is midi channel one synth two is midi channel two. The midi keyboards manual should show you how to toggle between the two. Feel free to message me with more technical questions on how to program the circuit for this sort of thing,synthesizers,dg5vqgz,2,t5_2rdyc

You output channels  as your left and right feed that through your FX chain then feed the resulting end of the signal into input channels . Set it up in your DAW and you will be fine. If youre using Ableton its even easier as you can use the external audio effect device included. But you can get also get a mixer than handles multiple inputs and outputs to your computer so you can do the same thing but with more devices if you end up adding more instruments.,synthesizers,dgcujls,2,t5_2rdyc

The entire point of the Octatrack and MPC Live is that theyre allinone boxes.Overbridge in particular seems pointless given what youre describing.

11720037,0,t1_dgo8c7x,Best advice I can offer is to go slow. Really slow like even when you are sure you need  modules buy  max. It doesnt have to be a massive pit of money and despair. I started with Clouds and Rings I quickly added Tides Peaks Veils Links Game System and Outs. I didnt really need Outs and I could have been fine without Tides. I found I can do way more than Game System with an iPad app and MIDI to CV. I can make entire tracks with just Rings or Rings and Clouds. The other stuff is useful and even fun but had I heeded my own advice I would have bought  of that second set and been just as fine. Eurorack isnt really about quantity despite what a lot will say. You have a pretty defined style as do I and that makes it much easier to get into Eurorack than I think a lot of people understand. The siren song is still strong though because it is just so interesting and fun to explore entirely new sonic territory.,synthesizers,dgohthv,4,t5_2rdyc
