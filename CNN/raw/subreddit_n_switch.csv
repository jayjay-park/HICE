9366983,0,t1_d92ely0,in a tablet form factor? easy. smart phones smaller than that do it without issues. we also still havent seen the bottom edge or back of the device. my only concern is if it has an sd micro sd card slot or theyd try to pull something like vita or more like the old days when every console had its own memory card types. they might have the game cart format also double as their mem cart format. I dont think nintendo WOULD do this the wii having an sd card slot was a smart move they sustained through all the products to today but a lot is changed with this one. also I wouldnt be suprised if when you hold one joycon in each hand they have gyroscopic controls built in to allow virtual console wii games.,n_switch,d93bys9,2,t5_3h489
