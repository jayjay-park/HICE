128609,0,t1_cet2ouf,Its all good! So basically make Ditto hold a Destiny Knot and hopefully the poke youre breeding it with has the right nature. If it does have the right nature make it hold an everstone! With Destiny Knot you pass down  IVs guaranteed from both parents. The IVs could be the ones you want or not! Its all up to luck from there!Best thing to do is breed out a higher IV to replace the one you place! After that its shooting the breeze sotospeak!,ShinyPokemon,cet2s8v,1,t5_2se9w

896724,0,t3_24dz70,I would invest your time in completing the pokedex to get the shiny charm because it does indeed help with wild encounters. Also friend safaris are great for shiny hunting due to their increased shiny rate! Another thing is try to multitask while shiny hunting like watch tv or something because you will get bored fast Just make sure you listen for that sparkle noise and pay close attention before you run. As for eggs always use the masuda method and again find something else to do while hatching to make it a little less mindnumbing. Finally when you do find a shiny save first freak out later incase you accidentally freezeturn off the game. Hope this helps and good luck hunting!,ShinyPokemon,ch67n50,3,t5_2se9w

It was during my most recent reset when I encountered Calems shiny Fletching. When the tutorial started I wasnt really paying attention so I only noticed the shiny Fletchling after hearing the little ching noise that a shiny Pokemon makes upon being released from its ball. I looked down and was pretty shocked so I didnt think to take a picture at that exact moment. Still I got out my IPod Touch and took a few shots of the shiny Fletchling. I know its kind of hard to tell that it is shiny due to the crappy picture quality but hopefully you will be able to make out the bits of yellow on the backside of the Fletchling that the regular Fletchling doesnt have.,ShinyPokemon,ck1jdht,3,t5_2se9w

Did you get yours on ORAS or DPPt?  cause I have to believe that ORAS portal legendaries are far more frequently shiny than anything else in the history of forever and .k sounds insane for seemingly higher odds.Ive never been one to use my shinies competitively  the only one I ever EV trained was a Rayquaza I had that had perfect speed and attack.  Couldnt use it officially but anything it fought Pokemon Battle Revolution or whatever it completely annihilated.  Im so heartbroken that I no longer have it ,ShinyPokemon,cmnfpdr,1,t5_2se9w
2528652,0,t3_2omuan,Hey I know your grind. Its rough trying to get a shiny... It really is. But heres the thing. You will eventually get one. I know its a long dark tunnel but keep at it trust me. The shiny you get first will make all of that worth it. Ive had my fair share of bad luck too when it comes to hunting. When I first started ORAS I caught a shiny sandshrew after a chain of just ...i thought man its going to be easy to chain with the dexnav to get shinies.. Man was I wrong. Later I got the shiny charm and I chained over  times for  pokemon magby slakoth and buneary. Never found one shiny crushed my spirit for hunting. Was chaining properly too. When I was playing pokemon Y I also had the shiny charm it took a fishing chain of around  to find a shiny Gyarados. Before that I was hunting in friend Safaris for one and encountered over  pokemon with not one shiny. The dexnav is still being discovered with how the chaining works and the shiny rate if Im correct. I think your best bet it to go with chain fishing... That was the easiest way for me. But it depends on who your hunting. I am sticking with masuda method and Im not specifically hunting for one. Just breeding a lot of different pokemon and if I get one great. If not oh well... Ive spent a ton of hours hunting for shinies and only found a few. Its hard. Especially if you dont have the shiny charm. I did get lucky tonight though after around  eggs total hatched from the beginning of the game my first Gible egg hatched to be shiny with  ivs. I was so happy cause Id never hatched a shiny via Masuda Method.. I was doubting if it works myself before that. My point is it does work just keep at it. A pokemon will shine for you soon.  ,ShinyPokemon,cmomq5e,2,t5_2se9w

2781737,0,t3_2rxq2x,Enter your game settings to configure LA and put a piece of tape presseing your R button. Then just press L instead of A when you want to talk to the legendary althought A still works and for soft reseting you just need to press Lselect so you can play single handed now.About counting you can measure the time it takes to do an SR or count how many SR you can do in  minutes for intance. Then just measure the time you spend SRing and do the math.,ShinyPokemon,cnk9vnr,1,t5_2se9w

I am definitely going to go for Zekrom at some point and hopefully Ill be able to buy OR before too long so I can SR Reshiram as well  I want to SR for all of the available legendaries but some of them I just am not too excited about...

4502818,0,t1_csy6t4c,Yup a message shows up telling its not available in my country. Most gamers here in South America are in fact hackers who try to chip consoles and games in order to spend as little money as possible. We have a really bad reputation lol and I strongly think that Nintendo just doesnt care about us cause they realized theyd be wasting lots of time and money.I found out that the Pokebank app can be downloaded by setting the console location to US UK or any other part of the globe where it is indeed available but theres something personal about this and its the payment thing. Its not expensive to be realistic but here weve been having some economic issues in the last years so the price in our currency could be  or even  times higher.

7886442,0,t3_4na70a,Just a bit of backstory for each. Wurmple was my first ever shiny. I was doing extra work for a television show when I was around about . At this point I had completely completed Heartgold but I was still heavily invested in it. I was in the big catching contest when it suddenly appeared. I never evolved it because I like it as a wurmple.Shiny number  Klefki. We had a big time gap between this one as this was on X. I was going to different universities around Britain where Im from! to study acting. One of the ones I went to let me know straight away I wouldnt be offered a place. Upset I set off for home which was like a  hour drive. My dad was driving so I just sat in the back playing Pokemon. Then the shiny Klefki appeared. I always consider my Klefki something that purposely appeared to cheer me up.My Porygon was my first attempt at DexNav chaining. Porygon is my second favourite Pokemon so I was overjoyed when I caught it. It took around  days.Suicune was when everything started to go to shit. I had a three hour break between lectures in university so I started to soft reset. After around  SR I found a shiny Suicune. I connected to the wifi put it in my Pokemon Bank account with the rest of my shinies then started to SR for a shiny Entei.When I next opened up my DS it came up with the message the game cartridge had been removed. I turned it off and on again and my save data corrupted. I lost everything except my shinies. A full pokedex gone.I completed Alpha Sapphire again and then bought a copy of Omega Ruby. During catching the legendaries I flew to fight Tornadus. It was a random shiny. I couldnt believe my luck. So thats where we are at the moment.,ShinyPokemon,d42ic11,1,t5_2se9w

After a fairly long hunt I just decided to go to Bank to grab some savedup BP since my hunt wasnt going anywhere anytime soon. Once I got back to the hunt my very first Horde Encounter had this Zubat! I already have a shiny Crobat so you can imagine that I was pretty salty.

Then you False Swipe one Minior use an Adrenaline Orb and Giga Drain the next Minior.Once the  HP Minior is los on PPs  PPs in total False Swipe an ally Minior and kill the one thats low on PPs. Once you find a shiny Minior False Swipe it switch to the second Parasect paralyze it to stop other allies from coming and kill its ally.However you will need  Leppa Berries to keep the PPs count but they can be easily farmed in the Island thing.,ShinyPokemon,da144hc,3,t5_2se9w

11471691,0,t3_63qah0,Grats! I tried Dexnav and lost patience trying to hunt it down too easily. Jsyk dexnav doesnt really need chaining the shiny chance is a constant regardless of your chain length I think somewhere  or something iirc. Its the same rate as friend safari except you get to actively hunt which species you want with dexnav instead of leaving it to chance. ,ShinyPokemon,dfwb775,2,t5_2se9w

11559658,0,t3_64yzcm,My first shiny ever was Fortuna the Happiny I got between the th and fourtieth call while chaining Pichu. I wasnt really looking for a shiny just seeing how long I could keep the chain and doing stupid things like stalling empty turns by using Hold Back.When I found out I could chain for shinies I looked up a guide and learnt how to do it a lot better.,ShinyPokemon,dg6ai82,4,t5_2se9w

11733270,0,t1_dgpu9wt,Damn thats awesome!! And I get you on the counting  Ive stopped counting my SRs. Find it much more enjoyable that way! I just got myself a Mesprit and Azelf and I have no idea how long they took. Just happy I got them ,ShinyPokemon,dgpzvd7,1,t5_2se9w
11765996,0,t1_dgrifuy,Well just got shiny Pichu as well.  Brave nature tho so good attack and low speed.  Hows this loadout sound attract double team return and perhaps some sort of paralyzing move,ShinyPokemon,dgtpf7q,1,t5_2se9w
11775668,0,t1_dguiu55,Hey Ive done it before haha. I used my master ball in X when I saw a RE Amoongus and only had level s that would OHKO it. And it was my only RE shiny ever I wasnt actually hunting it. ,ShinyPokemon,dgut3an,1,t5_2se9w
11797600,0,t1_dgx9xfa,I have heard that a specific combination of TIDSID in emerald actually makes the early shiny frame more likely. So is it unknown which combinations will generate the early shiny frame? If the TID and SID match I suppose which is what Im confusing with the cute charm. You have proven me wrong with the TIDSID in games other than emerald. Idk if I will still try to go for the shiny mudkip! I havent seen a zigzagoon be shiny yet since the last resets and save restart. For every file I soft reset do as much as  tries and keep randomizing the TIDSID? I hear to also go at the same speed but if you find a shiny zigzagoon thats the shiny frame and if you keep going at the same speed you might get the shiny starter. I just hope it wouldnt take so long. ,ShinyPokemon,dgxaqzc,1,t5_2se9w
