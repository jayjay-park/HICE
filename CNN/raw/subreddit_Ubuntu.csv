501880,0,t1_cfxag6v,So it is in Windows where I get mad that scrolling doesnt work. In Windows it will scroll whatever window was last clicked in not whichever window the cursor hovers over. In some Linux WMs you can have the focus follow the whatever window the mouse is hovering over but not raise the window raise  bring it to the fore front  draw on top. This is the method I prefer because I can scroll different windows without messing with the layering. But unity has a global menu. This means that if I have a maximized window with a smaller sized window on top and I want to get to the menu of the smaller window I have to move my mouse past the small window and over the maxed window thus focusing but not raising that window and changing the global menu over to the maxed window. It is impossible to get to the small windows menu in this situation. I would have to maximize the small window or minimize the maxed window.,Ubuntu,cfxbfl6,1,t5_2qh62

512781,0,t3_20033y,Hmm bummer. Usually I only see anything like that screen when the computer is turning off. Maybe it is a kernel panic? Blue Screen of Death is what happens when Windows has a kernel panic. Does it say kernel panic anywhere on the screen? I dont know why else you would be getting a memory dump like that.As far as getting rid of Windows that is easy! When you are installing Ubuntu the installer will say it detects Windows and give you some options install along side Windows something else and erase disk to install Ubuntu. You want to erase disk and install Ubuntu.

538497,0,t1_cg02q89,gtBut the way I see it thats rather pointless because if Im already getting into Windows I might as well skip the extra step and do whatever I was going to do from Windows instead.If thats the case you probably wont ever bother booting into Ubuntu. Its a lot more of a hassle to power down the machine and reboot into Windows than to just run a VM.I dual boot Windows and Ubuntu because there are certain games that wont run on Linux but I rarely play them anymore and just live in Ubuntu.I think the benefit of using Ubuntu as your primary environment and switching to Windows when you need to use a specific app is that you said you hate Windows . Why would you not want to spend as much time as you could in an OS you enjoy using?gtSetting up the file share thing seems more effort than its worth.Then you should definitely just stick to Windows. Ubuntu is great but there are a lot of instances where you have to do some serious research to get things running exactly how you want them. The benefit is you get to have things running exactly how you want them.It couldnt hurt to try it out in a VM and see how you like it. I personally love it but its not for everyone. ,Ubuntu,cg1hfis,1,t5_2qh62

Fostering ignorance about technology by continuing to cater to the lowest common denominator of user is only going to harm the industry and society in the long run.  People should be heavily encouraged to learn so that we dont need training wheels and silly things like a sad face on a blue screen. People pay attention when their cars make a funny noise or an indicator light comes on. Theres no reason why people cant learn a little bit about and do the same with their electronics. This is the year  and these are no longer magic black boxes. Its time for people to grow up stop being lazy and start learning the basics.

Trhought there are not yet a GUI I think to do that only  command will detect your device download the ROM appropriate transfer it to your phone and asking it to flash with this ROM and then telling you it will reboot the phone. You should have a look to the official guide If you choose channel devel you will have something like every one or two day an update. You can contact you LoCo maybe they can help you flashing your device if you need help even with the guide.  Usable as daily phone   Yes MMS is under the work I think since the icon to add a photo to your text just appear with last night update  Usable as daily smartphone   Not yet successful missing more apps but still usable cam map games tools...  Usable as a device that can by used as a PC     Since device are not yet enought powerfull and priority is to provide a both phone and tablet usability you will have to wait at least .  to have the best phablet to desktop feature.

At the time I only knew KDE superficially so I went through various GTK alternatives to Unity when I finally did go KDE Ive been constantly surprised at how extremely sensible everything is  across the board. Its endlessly customizable but you dont have to know that because of sensible defaults. As a little practical example notifications. In Unity theyre big and intrusive when they first occur you cant just click them away you cant click them for further info. But they dont stay for long and after theyre gone you have no way of catching up on past notifications. Ive always been WTF was the point of making it so?In kde OTH notifications are unobtrusive you can click them away theyre collected in a small icon on the panel you can click at any time to see all notifications. It will even display the number of notifications.I mean this simply makes sense.And this is just one small design decision that makes so much sense and creates so much extra daily convenience.In general every time Ive been frustrated something couldnt be done in KDE it turned it not only was possible but it was easy and the system was prepared for my needs.,Ubuntu,cit4qbu,3,t5_2qh62

1655713,0,t3_2d23of,hey they changed the rules to allow tech support questions if linked properly? well thats fun.BootRepair isnt designed as far as I know to wipe your computer. As Epistaxis said the it sounds like its a problem somewhere around the usb  not anything to do with the hard drive. its strange btw that your computer wont allow you to run either usb drive windows  or ubuntu. Does your computer have a DVD drive that you could try? If that works you could install ubuntu with a burnable dvd and bypass the usb altogether.Another thing that comes to mind is secure boot  particularly if this is a newer computer with windows  on it or something. I havent had to deal with this before though so I might be off base. If you suspect this too you could go into the UEFI settings usually by pressing delete during the normal boot process and poke around to see if there is a secure boot setting then turn it off. If the internet isnt lying to me then this is turned on by default in any windows  system.I didnt read the whole articles but these might be useful  ,Ubuntu,cjnv6px,1,t5_2qh62

The traditional desktop with a tablet interface. Reason why its not hated as much is because.. its not known as well as the brand Microsoft and term Windows but thats another story. Edit Actually looking at KDE Plasma netbooktabletwhatever interface they have for mobile devices it looks like Android which is pretty lame.I think Ubuntu perfected the interface if Unity  works that well on a phone I cant wait for the features theyll bring to the desktop version which will eventually become Ubuntu every version.

2183608,0,t3_2jxn95, Detailed menubased touchpad configuration. Palm recognition etc. is really important to me and the options that Unity offers are very basic. So I have to edit files try the new settings edit again trial and error to the perfect settings instead of playing around with a slider for a minute and there you go. To be fair Unity is way ahead of the two others DMs I revisited last weekend Cinnamon and KDE.  Driver support for wifi cards. Id love to run hostapd but both my internal card and a USB dongle I had around do not support it. Connectify runs fairly well on Windows bought it during a sale for  bucks. Money well spent if you stay at hotels  on the road a lot. The Unity tool for some reason only supports WEP connections and I cannot change the password easily ?.  Easy network configuration. Like switch off ipv routing on eth while a vpn connection that only supports ipv is active. I got it to work with some bash scripting and the vpnup and vpndown commands but the networkmanager dhcp is way too aggressive and always tries to activate everything. which is great but some more easily accessible config options to limit this behavior without restarting the daemon would be nice  or Id have to deactivate NM and lose comfort Onenote the best app Microsoft ever released Im aware most of this can be worked out with come bash and conf wrangling adding flexibility to your setup that in Windows is much harder to achieve if it is feasible at all. However Id rather spend that time customizing my emacs and eclipse setup. Because that is  actually a time investment that leads to directly increased productivity. And GTK eclipse looks horrible enough on my  so theres plenty or work anyway. Other than that I was really impressed how fast I am up to speed with my work flow after switching over to Ubuntu.

He was very smart and made a lot of claims that were hard to believe.I argued with him that sure you could double the space but it would slow the speed. The more you compress something the slower it takes to access it. That once you get into large numbers that the CPU wont support the program fails.I never figured out what happened to him he tried his own software company.

3969866,0,t1_cr8nw7h,gtAs I wrote in a post above Im not a huge fan of kodi. A few too many hidden menus and not intuitive enough for guests. You know that much of the menu thing can be configured to display more or less according to your preference right? As for guests I find that using the right theme made that problem all but disappear for my parents in their early sixties because not only are some themes more intuitive they also allow you to lock the interface in a kiosk mode so they dont get lost somewhere. My favorites for this are xTV SAF now known as AppTV Quartz and SioX. But if you are already using Plex and have it configured to your liking and have trained your users to use it appropriately by all means stick with what you know and like! They are based off the same original code base after all. I was just trying to point out some of what you could do with Kodis ten foot interface that maybe you might not have known about. If youre happy with Plex then you should stay with that. Otherwise back to your original posting I cant think of much youre unable to do with Linux these days and even then more and more Wine is able to step in for Windows apps on Linux even if its increasingly unnecessary. If you like games I heartily recommend finding PlayOnLinux for those games with no port to Linux you may even find they perform better on Linux through Wine than they run in Windows. ,Ubuntu,cr8sqgk,1,t5_2qh62

Google the generic unhelpful error message  application name. Sift through forum questions and responses. Try random stuff that might or might not work rinse and repeat.On Ubuntu actually I run Debian these days but we you can troubleshoot deeply! First off the error message is typically more helpful and might point you in the right direction straight away. Even if it doesnt you can fire up the application from a terminal and watch its output as it crashes. They almost all have log files and its content often helps you when googling.Finally if nothing else works if youre mysteriously having a problem nobody on the entire internet have ever had before you can debug the software yourself since youve got trivial access to the source code. You almost never have this option in a Windows environment.Frankly Ive never had to go to that last step.

5890418,0,t3_3vx9wl,I agree that easier to use for nontech people should be a priority. My issue has been that if you automate kernel updates they fill up the boot partition and cause problems and if you dont keep your kernel uptodate you get other problems or are slower to get fixes e.g. for sleepwake bugs. As kind of an experiment I have left a couple of very nontechy people with LTS installed and the updates have been a problem in both cases.Errorreporting is also an embarrassment. partly because due I believe to the above issue every boot up results in an error. There is absolutely a privacy concern with automated error reporting and I appreciate Ubuntu taking a conservative position here as opposed to Windows which you have to try really hard to disable but it would be nice to have some setting that automatically reported all those errors and more importantly it would be nice not to get those errors.,Ubuntu,cxrrnow,22,t5_2qh62

They just wanted to code and access the Internet through IRC and Newsgroups. They wanted a system which doesnt force a useless memoryguzzling graphical interface on them.It was only later that there were attempts to make Linux into a usable graphical desktop system and the traditionalists didnt like it and still dont like it today.With Ubuntu phone the intent was to be a competitor to Android and iOS from the start.

6976113,0,t3_4b8iw3,Ehh. The answer is different for every person so Im not going to try to come up with a lot of objective reasons like some people state as fact. The truth is Canonical is a company just like Microsoft is a company. Theyve made business decisions in the past that upset the community and by the opinions of some have abused their virtual monopoly on Desktop Linux. So dont find yourself under any illusions that Ubuntu is some bastion of freedom.The reason I use Linux in general is because Im more productive on Linux distros. Ive been using computers since you had to know how to navigate the Dos command line to use them. I like using the command line. It clicks with me. Being able to fire up practically any Linux installation and type ssh userhost to remote into my servers or to install a package in the blink of an eye by typing pacman S packagenameor whatever your package manager of choice is is the type of time saving that can shave hours off of a work week. As a Linux user when a new file system comes out that supports a new feature like snapshots that are highly useful to me I switch to it. Not wait for Microsoft to implement the feature.The reason I use Ubuntu is because of the release cycle. Thats pretty much it. I use my PC for work. The release cycle for Debian or CentOS cant keep up with my package version needs on a stable platform. Arch and Gentoo while I greatly prefer them to Ubuntu require more attention than I can provide for my work machine. Ubuntu gives me the perfect balance of up to date packages and stability. The only other distro Ive found that compares is OpenSUSE but Ive had nothing but poor experiences with their KDE implementation. I have some reservations about Unity but its stability is not one of them.Really youre never going to learn anything by asking vague questions like this. Trying to convince someone who is aware of Linux to use Linux is a fools errand. The only person who can convince you is you and the only way to do that is by just using it. Not just to tinker around with and poke at but to recreate your daily routine on. Spend a month using nothing but Ubuntu. Every time you run into some problem that clashes with the routing you did on Windows set out to solve that issue. Keep tackling them one at a time until youve found a comfortable setup for you.,Ubuntu,d172w7x,20,t5_2qh62
6979972,0,t3_4b8iw3,The thing is A list of advantages isnt really enough to answer your question. There are tons of websites that do that. But you wont be able to really understand the benefits you could have from that. Like the benefits of living in a different culture you only really understand it and its people when you lived there for a while.Another important question is if you can live with the disadvantages. Each OS has its own set of unique features and problems. I personally prefer the problems on Linux to any other OS and afters years of using it for me its the opposite I dont really get anymore why people dont look for alternatives regarding all the artificial limitations and the lack of functionality. Windows is a barebone OS and depending on the circumstances can be really inconvenient e.g. having to look helplessly for hours? at an update progress bar... it doesnt have to be that way.,Ubuntu,d17io6l,3,t5_2qh62

However the card influence is very recent so it is difficult to honestly say that it was developed in tandem and without influence. Great artists steal and all that. I am out of shape in the design field and honestly yearn for some guidance. As yet we have very few examples of what Suru is but not enough in my opinion to form a cohesive vision. And those examples are usually VERY simple apps never something complex. Again I would like to stress this is only MY outlook That is why I put out the call for those apps. They all bring some interaction to the table that others do not and would help to flesh out the design language.Compare this to Material Nearly every app Google offers has material design and emulation is easy making extension an exercise but accomplishable.

I just use OpenElec on the server attached to my TV and stream movies and videos to my Android devices using Yatse remote amazing software. If you want to share more than just multimedia you can look at other NASserver distros OpenMediaVault   Rockstor   FreeNAS   NASFree   Amahi   Zentyal Community Version is free   ClearOS Community Version is free  Some have paid addons or are commercial products offering a free version but basic file sharing should be fully usable with the free base OS. ,Ubuntu,d50eape,2,t5_2qh62

8401585,0,t3_4uny9b,I switched to Linux mainly because of privacy reasons all the Windows  Prism spying shit. I tried various distros and have settled on Ubuntu for now.I like Ubuntu mainly because of Unity. I really want to be able to like the other desktop environments but they have various dealbreakers for me or are just horrible out of the box so I keep finding myself going back to Unity. Unity has some issues too particularly the placement of the closeminimisemaximise buttons and the lack of customisation but it works pretty great out of the box and is the one that I like the most so far.The killer features of Unity for me are . it looks great out of the box good default settings something KDE is horrible at in my opinion . integrated menus hover over a windows titlebar to see the menu . the HUD on the Alt key which lets you directly accesssearch menu items by typing their name . it feels modern . the work theyve done on convergence looks great. Still I keep trying the other desktop environments to see if I can learn to like them...Other than that Ubuntu feels the most polished and professional out of the distributions that Ive tried. It also has a lot of community support and due to its popularity it seems to be wellsupported with things like PPAs.,Ubuntu,d5rqt53,2,t5_2qh62

I actually liked Windows . on my laptop. The interface was quite nice on a touchscreen but I became really frustrated trying to determine what updates of theirs I wanted and how to avoid the bad ones. When I saw that they were installing Windows  upgrade reminders that was the last straw for me.gt For example Simply install steam. When my friends have been asking me about computer games as of late my answer has been My computer is broken right now.Its the same as on Windows. You go to their website and download the deb exe and run it.gt Ninja edit Also I am thinking of reinstalling ubuntu because I dont know anything about partitioning the hard drives.

If that is so you can try out proxychains to hop on to several proxies to traverse out of your network.If that doesnt work....then it highly depends on what you want to achieve.

Finally any solutions provided are either not actual solutions or only seem to work for a while.The  month old question I could not find it that I originally mentioned which had no answers was more specifically geared toward finding a solution that allowed proper performance of the APU under .The issue is that I do not want to view locking myself into x resolution and no APU support as a a solution.

9718557,0,t1_dab08f4,Thanks for the help. Alright if I ask this to just getting everything straight since Im still a newbie with this stuff?So the scaling everyone is talking about which can be controlled outofthebox with Unity and with gnometweaktool on Gnome and gsettings on the ArchLinux wiki it just controls the feature size on the desktop UI. Its not directly changing the display screen resolution to nonnative right? Which you and a couple of people said would also work in this thread.And finally if I do change the UnityGnome scaling options I will still need to mess around with firefox thunderbird and google chrome a bit right? The only issue I kind of have with that is that I was hoping to also have an very wide nonHiDPI external monitor at work. So I would just plug into it whenever I was at work and work on it. But if I change the scaling and mess around with the firefox and thunderbird settings then whenever I plug into the external monitor I presume it wont automatically go back to normal and will look terrible. Is there any way to automatically do it so I wouldnt have to mess around with the settings every morning? ,Ubuntu,dab0ube,1,t5_2qh62

9968453,0,t3_5ia3xj,For me its a testament to one of the great failings of linux that there are  in contention and neither of them are banshee or rhythmbox which at various times have been the default player. Making a good audio program is a problem that was solved over a decade maybe ? ago with winamp yet the amount of dev effort that has poured in has been immense with so much of it overlapping and wasted. Seems like a shame that there isnt more centralised planning  collaborating in the linux space e.g. in this case for there to be a nominal main player or two that devs would be encouraged to work on and hone to perfection rather than continually creating new ones every year.,Ubuntu,db6wz7x,1,t5_2qh62

You simply cant expect normal people to solve problems by editing config files or sudo apt xxxx etc. People arent wired for that. Theyd rather go to any number of websites run installers even use regedit.And Windows  for all the flak it gets is actually a great OS.

11013307,0,t3_5wvw9t,gtSudo console thingieThis worries me. I think you need to put Linux on a spare computer or in a VM so you can play around with it and not worry about ruining anything. Every program command and daemon runs as a user of some kind. Every user has a different set of restrictions and abilities. Most of them are system users that you wont even mess with. Normally everything you do is run as yourself which is very good.sudo is a command that you put in front of other commands to make them run as root or the highest level user. Root can do everything. That means if you run Firefox with sudo then Firefox can destroy your system by writing to the operating system folders or to other user home directories or to the Internet or overwrite your firmware and hard brick your entire computer forever.Its not the sudo console thingie. Its called a terminal.Examples of commands you could run in a terminal    echo hello worldWould print hello world into the next line of the terminal.    sudo echo hello worldWould do the same as the above but do it as the root user.The difference here is fine. Who cares?but    totallynotavirus.exeWould only infect your own users home directory if if was infected with something.    sudo totallynotavirus.exeWould infect you every other user on the computer the entire OS any potentially every other drive or OS on that machine.Linux doesnt use EXE files by the way. That was just an example.Similarly     delete this folderWould delete that folder. If you make a mistake the worst that happens is that you remove a folder with your important files in it.    sudo delete this folderA mistake here could easily delete EVERYTHING on every drive in the machine. If you have network folders it might even delete the files in those too.The point is that you seem new to how Unixlike operating systems work. I wholly encourage you to play with them and figure out how they work. Just know that you will break everything many many times. Everyone does at first. Its like the Dark Souls of operating systems. Its hard and unforgiving at first but is super powerful and can do amazing things once you figure it out.Put Linux on a computer that you dont care about. Do everything you want on that and dont even think of putting valuable data on it for at least a month.I say this because you apparently know about admin tools like sudo but dont know about basic things like a terminal. That means you are going to break things. So break things where it doesnt matter first. Thats how you learn.,Ubuntu,degbsqb,3,t5_2qh62

And it would probably be an enormous amount of work to replace all the GNOME components and make a fork of the shell with the kind of behaviour and graphical design theyd want.,Ubuntu,dfw3b1w,12,t5_2qh62

11497187,0,t1_dfy3qpj,To me it feels like this clears the uncertainty. Now well get a solid desktop environment and set of programs which gets updated every release. Gnome is backed by big companies like Red Hat as well.I would say Ubuntu had stopped improving since . Versions since then have had so many regressions in usability. New users mustve hated . especially people who play games. Installing Steam and graphics drivers was a nightmare on most versions of Ubuntu after ..,Ubuntu,dfz7exx,1,t5_2qh62

11513811,0,t3_64cmh3,gt Q Why arent we collaborating with Yunit? A We are having conversations with them. They want more desktop focus while we have more mobile focus. Both projects benefit from the others work. Having two forks of Unity  makes no sense.I really hope this works. Having  forks just after the original project announced dead absolutely makes no sense. ,Ubuntu,dg13bur,6,t5_2qh62

11574483,0,t1_dg7kqwo,I dont think anyone has issues with the availability of extensions. Thats a great thing and it was Gnome s extensibility that made it so appealing for so long. The issue most have is with the fact that in Gnome  one must use a bunch of extensions to replace features that should really be there in the first place. It doesnt have to be KDE mind you which has long had a kind of everything but the kitchen sink situation but you shouldnt have to dig into dconf and troll through a web site to restore basic functionality that exists in virtually every other desktop environment.,Ubuntu,dg7z2bb,2,t5_2qh62

11681858,0,t3_66o1vu,I really cant agree with you enough! I love this feature.

11684249,0,t1_dgjhqjb,Thank you sgorf. Did you know that we System have an open communication with NVIDIA developers working on the graphics driver? When we can SHOW that customers are using their hardware under Linux and give them numbers they care more about addressing bugs.We also send them our machines so they can test things. We try to advocate for Linux with each of our partners Intel NVIDIA Realtek etc. Then we get downvoted by people like utangerinelion and uShantanuJoshi and for what? For actually giving a shit about Linux? Fortunately customers like Pixar and a bunch of Silicon Valley companies doing big things understand the importance of machines that just work with the OS they need to use to get things done every day. As a result they are our customers. Why? Because we put more time effort and expertise into making great Linux machines than anyone else. And thats why rUbuntu loves us.,Ubuntu,dgkfdlv,3,t5_2qh62

11807673,0,t1_dgyens3,I just made the move yesterday. Went from an Asus PQC with an e and gb and an XFX HD that was only there so the board would boot to an Optiplex  with the same i and GB of RAM. The only issue I had was the network adapter is now eth instead of eth and the IP address on the network changed so I have to edit the network drive from my Windows machine and update the settings in NoMachine. I still have some of the buffering issues with video playback but I think that has more to do with the lack of memory in the PlayStation .,Ubuntu,dgyfvh9,2,t5_2qh62
