750050,0,t3_22qy5g,What flavor is it?  Baus looks like it is pretty highly ratedhas really good reviews from what I see but I havent tried it myself.   Burnt plastic taste sounds like a problem with your tankcartoclearo.,vaperettes,cgpjcmy,1,t5_318qj

833904,0,t1_cgz2938,Mini Protanks were my first upgrade as well amp I loved them way more than the plastic ones that I had originally gotten at a BampM near me.  Now Im using an aerotank amp a PT on my vamo but I do have to agree with enjoying the pull.  My hubby has a AGAT I think amp it takes no effort at all.  Kinda weird to get used to.,vaperettes,cgz2ff6,1,t5_318qj
844174,0,t1_ch08efo,Yeah in Oz we had an  seater  wheel drive van her name was the TARDIS because she was TARDIS blue and my geekdom casts a wide net and we did the rolling farm thing down the Gold Coast from Brissy a few times. Presumably my ex is still doing that actually. I was pretty hardcore while I was there but mostly because the ex was...and I think I burnt out a little which is why its taking me so long to start playing more again. ,vaperettes,ch08iem,1,t5_318qj

852034,0,t1_ch14o31,Ugh.  I understand that.  Were lucky though Craving Vapor is in town amp since it took mine in there amp got him hooked on Mothers Milk we havent bought anything at the other place. ,vaperettes,ch14q9i,1,t5_318qj
1271957,0,t1_cicpaar,Isnt it awesome when you discover that your regular beauty products supplement vaping really well?For example I kept reading about vapers trying koh gen do cotton. When I got to try koh gen do I realized it was just a different brand of Japanese cotton. I bought shiseido cotton at sephora . vs  and it wicks the same. ,vaperettes,cicpnhp,3,t5_318qj
