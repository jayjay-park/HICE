9627937,0,t3_5cv11l,I personally prefer TL over DFT because I like the early burst but it all depends on your playstyle. Ive also noticed that I dont have a problem vs tanks with it either especially with black cleaver. Another good thing g is Urgot kind of negates assassins in with his ult making it easy to blow them up. I was lucky enough to get the butcher skin in the hextech crafting shop its not as great as you think the q is a little weird to use. I also think Battle cast is the best looking skin on him though,UrgotMains,d9zuafz,1,t5_3303r

11481420,0,t1_dfwerri,woah my mind is blown. I grew up playing Doom  nonstop and had completely forgotten about these sexy beasts. Maybe the nostalgia is why Ive loved playing urgot all these years lol.,UrgotMains,dfxf01s,1,t5_3303r
