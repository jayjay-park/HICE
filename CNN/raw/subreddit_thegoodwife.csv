1312605,0,t3_27mxrs,Ive read the comments in here and would like to shed some light on Alicias relationship with KalindaThe friendship was based on a false pretense. This isnt Alicias opinion its the truth. Kalinda Spoiler Season  extended plots has actively hid her involvement with Peter Florrick. Alicia might be able to forgive Peter for sleeping with hookers because with the exception of Amber Madison they are nameless and faceless to her. Kalinda however is the humanizing factor of Peters infidelity. She as usilentmediocrity pointed out is not an anonymous hooker but a friend and confidant for Alicia. Alicia trusted and confided in her. Shes become one of Kalindas many victims manipulated and used to further her goalsSEE Spoilers The timing of the reveal also influences Alicias overreaction. As Jackie puts it ...I cannot see him hurt on the day he should be happiest I have never seen him so destroyed. The election win should also be a happy moment for Alicia but the news delivered by investigator Andrew Wiley devastates her. Alicia first hears of her husbands infidelity preseason  as a housewife watching TV. Her husband went to prison so he was effectively out of sight out of mind. With the revelation the infidelity and betrayal comes full circle. As Kalinda is part of her work life and Peter represents her personal life Alicia cannot hide from the sins of the husband and the betrayal from her best friend. The first step to reclaiming her life is to kick Peter out of the apartment.I hope this helps.,thegoodwife,ciha9lj,1,t5_2syf7
1417726,0,t1_citxpqa,Oh I love Mad Men I just feel that the first half of season  was mediocre for  or  of the  episodes. I think it hasnt been as spectacular as it was in the first  seasons recently although it is still very strong. I do expect the second half of season  to be of incredibly high quality but I found the first half a bit underwhelming.I think that Mad Men used to be the best show on television but that season  and . of Breaking Bad topped it and this past season The Good Wife took the title. I feel season  of TGW was very similar in tone and approach to seasons  and  of MM. I agree that there are similarities between TGW and MM and I always recommend TGW to MM fans Ive created a handful of new fans this way hahaha. ,thegoodwife,citzo09,2,t5_2syf7

Hes just a jackass all around if you ask me and not breaking it off with Ramona when Alicia told him to was a typical Peter thing to do if you ask me. The most I can hope is that this latest scandal motivates Alicia to do the risky thing jump in with both feet and admit that her marriage is a sham and that shes been effectively single for several years now.I respect the hell out of Alicia for saying that she had made a vow to make it work by getting married but Peter was never really worth it if you ask me and hes not even worth the trouble of having around for politics sake.,thegoodwife,cnmhbbt,0,t5_2syf7

3805062,0,t3_33z14f,I think Alicia will join the dark side and go with Canning or another firm and not start her own firm again. Its just I didnt like the two firm plots it either divided the show marginalized good characters or implied that there were only two firms in town just to avoid the former two problems.  Any way I cant wait for Alicia to be back in court and kick some serious ass. For next season I really wish they bring backin more judges with character not just plain annoying like the Cary case one.

3875750,0,t3_34rgv9,The biggest thing that has bugged me about this season is how it portrays the office of the SA and the election for that office as being some huge thing. Most people do not even know who the DASA for their county is they are not local celebrities and there are certainly not well covered debates between candidates or anything like that. They make it seem like she was running for governor. Also for this episode first degree murder? That is absolute rubbish. First degree murder is premeditated and deliberate. The alleged crime was a fight in a parking lot. If someone died from that fight it would be voluntary manslaughter or second degree murder. That prosecutor drastically over reached. Also the issue with the IA investigation pissed me off. She should have claimed privilege and refused to divulge any name. It is her ethical duty to investigate the case for her client and that includes the witnesses against her client. The details of her investigation are privileged. It cannot be compelled and if the judge held her in contempt she would win the contempt hearing too. Somebody broke the law by divulging the investigation? Boo hoo not the defense attorneys problem. She didnt break the law by learning of the information. ,thegoodwife,cqy2ho7,10,t5_2syf7

I suppose from the prospective of Alicias character it makes sense Diane and Cary were collateral damage. Also note the stuff about Will being a fantasy. He says what Alicia wants to hear.
