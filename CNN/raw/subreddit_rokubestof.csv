3644758,0,t3_323t1r,Just tried it this week. Simpsons  Seinfeld  Game of Thrones  and HBO streams. Works pretty well. Sadly streams go offline randomly. Quality is dependent on the streaming source so it can be hit or miss with audio screen size and image quality. Previously I used JustinTV but after that was taken down last year this seems like an excellent replacement. ,rokubestof,cq7q9am,4,t5_2tiof
