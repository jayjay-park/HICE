8494720,0,t1_d63cx19,That container info sounds right. I just started playing like one week into Izu Event so I have been scrambling. I kept all the resource gifts in my gift box so I am using that an dailys to supplement my resources and I havent bottomed yet. Somehow I finished the last event and got a pretty good AR Aug which is on par with my AK starter. Sniper drop was surprisingly sub standard as she never does the individual tactic I tell her and literally camps there doing nothing. On average my ARs and SR are level  and I tried the triangle formations in all combinations including what you describe and could not get past  runs. The diagonal formation with  hg front  ar middle and  SR rear got me to  runs before Break . With my current formation in a line with sg in the bottom right hand corner I am getting around  runs but I want to level up the SMG drop I just got so right now I only get  runs before I have to heal her.I wish Shooting Girls had a big enough budget to have a new OST for each event but I guess I should be grateful they even have voice acting. Im making do by playing e OP Theme in the background. Closest browser game sortie song I know without just opening up the Kancolle OST.,shootinggirl,d63e27w,2,t5_38t05
