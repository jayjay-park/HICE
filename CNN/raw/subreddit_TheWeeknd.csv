3376290,0,t3_2ytlsh,I think theyre too different to compare really. Kiss land marks a time in Abels life where he is no longer depressed and is starting to branch out by experiencing new things. Subsequently the tracks on there all have a strong Asian feel and the lyrics are starting to turn away from the depression that is Trilogy. In my opinion the two albums work together to tell his story through emotion Trilogy is his pain and depression taking over and influencing his life while Kiss land is focusing on the emotions brought on from experiencing the world. To fully experience and appreciate them the albums need to be listened to together or else they lose the spark that makes them so unique.Going off topic here but I think it needs to be said while Im talking about influences... As hes putting out these new songs hes in a place where fame and partying are major parts of his life however this isnt the type of partying like Triolgy was. These are happiness fueled and bring on good times hes no longer escaping. This environment he is in is just another stage for him and it happens to be one that many other artists sing about which makes it seem like his music is losing its uniqueness and becoming generic. However hes evolving as an artist and that needs to be welcomed or else he will eventually become obsolete. Consistency is the hallmark of the unimaginative and Abel is far from that.For individual songs though I think Trilogy would be the best if it wasnt old enough that Ive heard all the tracks a hundred times.,TheWeeknd,cpd4ejj,3,t5_2t9fh

9687442,0,t3_5ds07p,Its the whole premise of the album. Why are people complaining? This is what it means to be a Starboy double entendre for an artist whos made it in the spotlight been on every stage and has done it all and has MAJOR pop appeal... exactly like youre seeing now. This is just another phase in Abels career  enjoy it for what it is. This album is not supposed to have deep lyrical content its supposed to be the definition of Starboy. Think of it as an alterego for The Weeknd.This new style is also just a flex from The Weeknd showing that he can do it all. Switch up my style I take any lane... lyrics from Starboy title track.This is just another flex similar to how he released three mixtapes in a year which later became Trilogy to prove he could shit out music like nothing.,TheWeeknd,da76kxi,31,t5_2t9fh

Basically though listen to Michael Jackson Butterflies off his lesser known album Invincible.I feel like butterflies is easily the weeknd in one song.  EditITS THE FALLING IN LOVE  from off the wall sounds like the basic inspiration of I feel it coming. I reps are similar  Edit  steering away from MJ kindaToto  Roseanna.
