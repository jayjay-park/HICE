159714,0,t1_cewm3hw,Huh yeah I guess because Im following prospects and have been a fan for  years though I have lived across the country for about half that time Im just a consumer. Ill make sure to ask for a refund on my  game day audio package this year thats all I spend on baseball beyond a game or two each year at stadiums that arent wrigley.Just looked at your other post and yeah it MUST be a big conspiracy to keep losing. Certainly not an effort to invest wisely in the longer term or not blow money on huge names... winning would just mean lost money for the organization. s.

160398,0,t3_1vx39z,In what way is the rebuild struggling?  Soler had a few setbacks and we didnt get a pitcher that everyone knew was going to the Yankees or Dodgers anyway. Its not even been officially released what the Cubs offer was but it was rumored to be M.  Id have given up that extra  mil too if it meant I had a shot to win right away and not waste a year or two on a team thats not ready to win it all.  It doesnt make sense to throw stupid big contracts at people who are going to be wasted for a year or two while they wait for prospects to mature.  We could drop loads of money on a pitcher or two or a Soriano but if we have a handful of big contracts wed still have a roster filled out by mediocre talent.   Theyve said all along what the timeline is and that theyll be major players at signing players when they wont be wasting time and money.  Tanakas not gonna make us a contender this year or in .  Would we win more games?  Maybe but what good is an ace pitcher if the rest of your lineups not producing runs consistently.Another benefit to having a great farm system is being able to flip those redundant players for starting pitchers.  Much the way weve done with flipping Garza Dempster or Maholm for young prospects like Grimm Hendricks Olt and Vizcano.This years not gonna be pretty and there will assuredly be a bust or two.  Take solace in the fact that theyre trying to build a team that will consistently be contenders and not just hoping a cobbled together team will get lucky a couple of times a decade.  People want instant gratification with everything these days and can become petulant when we have to wait for all the pieces to fit.

Thats the model theyre working under. Most of the guys they have playing this year i.e. everyone other than Castro Rizzo and Olt if they can be flipped for good prospects theyre going to get flipped. Ill be sad to see Shark leave as hes been one of only a few highlights for the Cubs the last few seasons but looking at the biglong term picture hes probably gone for the right set of pieces.

I happen to think this next year Theo and friends are going to gather more pitching. They could blow something like  million this offseason.  More of the sign and trade type guys.  This idea of stacking offense seems solid to me.  In many ways it makes more sense than getting great pitching. You cant win if you dont score runs.

2320046,0,t1_clygmqa,these last two seasons he wasnt and his peripherals have never been that good. outside of his first season where he only pitched  innings hes never had a FIP xFIP or SIERA under ,Cubs,clygzpe,2,t5_2qmnl
2320131,0,t1_clygzpe,Fair enough but I think you can probably compare him to Bronson Arroyo. One he left the AL East he was generally a much better pitcher and I think Hellickson could possibly see that too.,Cubs,clyhdcz,1,t5_2qmnl
2329063,0,t1_clzb6lv,Arrieta had  innings over  seasons prior to joining the Cubs. Realistically zero of these turned into a full season.  Neimann has  including  full seasons. Thats a huge difference. Arrieta was a guy with the potential that just never harnessed it. Hellickson was a guy with potential who harnessed it. It just isnt as high as some previously though and right around where some thought it would be as well. Despite rising K rates in the MLB he has never been able to replicate his high K from the minors. In fact as the K has become more prevalent hes struck out less. Meanwhile Arrieta had and kept his K potential he just couldnt control shit. THAT is a problem that can often be fixed through a mechanical change. Arrietas been able to quiet down his motion and repeat it more consistently. Hellicksons at the point where his BB wont really fall its right where its been and its pretty serviceable. Lowering your walk rate from . is a lot different than lowering it from .. That leaves him to try and gain more Ks. I dont really believe a guy with Hellicksons track record and full repertoire can just bump his K rate up especially when its been falling against trends. Maybe if it was a matter of adding a rd or th pitch to keep guys off balance and keep focus off the one or two wipeout pitches he has then itd be a different story. But thats not the case. Hellickson is a guy that throws a bunch of different average pitches. He doesnt have a goto pitch if he needs to put a guy down. Theres just not a lot to change. Hes been consistent for  years and  innings. Nothings changing. So thats where the comparison between the two guys ends. I dont really think there is much of one. Why else is Hellickson a bad fit? Hes a flyball pitcher who has given up too many HRFB...at the Trop. That could turn into a NIGHTMARE at Wrigley. Look what happened to Travis Wood when his HRFB returned from really good  to average . Thats not the only reason for his regression but it is huge and Hellicksons given up . HRFB over his career at the Trop one of the most pitcher friendly parks when it comes to dingers. Furthermore and back to the Arrieta vs Hellickson I guess Arrieta really didnt have great coaching in Baltimore. Theyve done a terrible job of developing young arms and theyve had plenty of chances over the past decade. On the other hand Jim Hickey in Tampa is an awesome pitching coach known for getting the most out of his guys like Bosio. But yeah I agree there is some potential for him. If something clicks and he gets back to the top  prospect upside he had or really half of that itd be a good pickup. It just doesnt make sense for the Cubs nor does it make sense to say he has a TON of potential .gtA more spacious ballpark could do wonders for him.The Trop is spacious. th in HR this past year.  park factor according to bref.,Cubs,clzl2oi,1,t5_2qmnl

It would tax your bullpen in the first game of the playoffs even if it went well! Rich pitched over  innings in ONE start all season!Deciding to give Demp the start was easily supported and logical. He was worth  winsWAR in ! Giving it to anyone else is silly at the time AND in hindsight. In the end Dempster and Harden both pitched in the playoffs and both lost their game end of story. Dempster was the best most durable and consistent pitcher on the team in a full year. Zambrano was not an Ace at that point Lilly was a  guy and Harden was great in  inningstarts but was not a  guy.Dempster was a solid starter who put his peak season together in . His next two combined seasons in  where he came back to Earth  . ERA . WHIP   Win player. Still better than ZambranoHarden the next two seasons.Ryan was clearly by all reasoning the most valuable starter on the team.

3736803,0,t1_cqhsl02,Agreed. th is the best spot for him. When SolerRizzo hitting  is the alternative Castro hitting  definitely doesnt make the team better.,Cubs,cqi7xnq,1,t5_2qmnl
3743990,0,t1_cqizsja,No but youre missing one thing. If they really think Addison Russell is the player we all think he could be Arbitration is very important. Which is why I think they will try to wait till the July deadline. Also JedTheos policy is at least  AB at AAA before coming up to the MLB. So all those facts say that he wont be up until July. ,Cubs,cqj1fyb,-1,t5_2qmnl
3758464,0,t1_cqke4eo,I feel...vindicated???for pointing out that Jackson is not an asshole just not a good pitcher these last  years.  He put a lot of miles on his arm in his career.

If Montero is still in the picture next year maybe Schwarber can come up as a backup getting a start or  per week behind the plate and then splitting left field duties with someone. ,Cubs,csfdmzk,3,t5_2qmnl
