4283924,0,t3_3a1q1s,So on XFCE ..x when mapping SuperT to xfceterminal on my Gentoo box I got the focus without issue.My settings are  Windows Manager  FocusAutomatically give focus to newly created windows  TRUEAutomatically raise windows when they receive focus  FALSE changing that doesnt workWindows Manager Tweaks  FocusActivate focus stealing prevention  FALSE Honor standard ICCCM focus hint  TRUEWhen a window raises itself  Bring window on current workspaceGenuine question why is it a pain in the ass to set Activate focus stealing prevention  FALSE for you ?Ive pretty much a mouse driven workflow so its maybe because of that that I dont see any issue with this.Edit  Actually even when activating the focus prevention I got the focus but the first terminal Ive open didnt get it... guess Ill stay with this setup for a while to see if it works or not.,xfce,cs8inoh,2,t5_2qliy

10301687,0,t1_dcbi22j,i sure dont only used xfce for a couple days comparing it to mate after many months usage im even using compiz at the moment so i had to turn that off for the xfwm settings to even open... at least im quickly becoming familiar enough with multiple DEs amp how all these components workif this was windows id use processmonitor to find out what value is changing i have heard of something similar in linux just havent tried it yetyou could also search the xfce code to find what sizes its using i kinda expect it to be a percentage of the screen instead of pixelsthe glaring issues in everything linux demands i start developing amp contributing though...,xfce,dcbr2pn,1,t5_2qliy
