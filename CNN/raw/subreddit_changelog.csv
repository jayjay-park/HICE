376378,0,t3_1ydu2d,Just a thought but it would be nice to be able to classify bans to avoid them being all in the same list. For example I have spammers banned who are never getting unbanned. I dont need to ever see them again. I put them in the spammer classification and they are gone from my view. Then I can put people in the jerkface category and they might get unbanned later say everyone who gets jerkfaced only gets a  month ban then Im not sorting through pages of bans looking for bans to remove.,changelog,cfjrzap,1,t5_2qhc9

4256092,0,t1_cs5cv0d,gtThats great but the numerous blog posts about upholding neutrality free speech Reddit as a type of government rather than private corporation etc. show otherwise.And numerous shadowbannings and banning of subreddits in the past show that reddit spits a good PR game.gtThey made a whole post about the fappening saying how they wont ban subreddits because of the content whether morally objectionable or not but only because of illegal posts. Lets look at that blog post shall we?gtWhile we may believe that users should behave in a certain way the methods we use to influence that behavior fall into two different classesgt. Actions which cause or are likely to cause imminent physical danger e.g. suicides instructions for selfharm or specific threats or which damage the integrity and ability of the site to function e.g. spam brigading votecheating are prohibited or enforced by hard policy such as bans and rules.    Lets look into what got rpcmasterrace banned in the past shall we?Man repeatedly interfering with other subreddits and harassment of moderators and users. What other subreddit in recent days was banned for that?The difference of course is that PCMasterRace was given a chance at redemption and FPH was not. Without direct explicit knowledge of the inner workings of either sub Im guessing that PCMR had much less in the way of admin contact than FPH did and much less in the way of dramatic happenings.gtThe bottom line is that while subs like FPH were pretty terrible what they were doing wasnt illegal and by banning them Reddit admins are clearly going against earlier stated policy.If  years ago I post saying We allow pictures of hurr durr and  year ago I post saying We no longer allow pictures of hurr durr then yes I am going against earlier stated policy because I am replacing it with new policy. In FPHs case that appears immaterial because the admins were going by internal policy that existed for years but was only recently codified into a specific externally displayed rule. They regularly banned users and subs for harassing behavior. FPHs case is only unique because they let it grow as big as it did.gtIf the real reason was targeting and harassing individuals we would see A LOT more banned subreddits and users than we do.Maybe we will. Maybe this was just the first wave of many for subreddits that target and harass individuals.gtThe fact that weve gone  years without very many bans overall shows that as fact.And the fact that weve just banned  subreddits for harassment shows that the times they are a changing.,changelog,cs5dnnk,1,t5_2qhc9

It is also very authoritarian and pushes all subreddits towards creating a set of hard and fast rules which moderators of smaller or more community oriented subreddits may want to avoid. To me the whole thing is just overengineered.

10308730,0,t1_dccjfmu,Good. Be ause if you mixed them with regular posts I would have to kill you.Which manner of execution do you want guillotine or something of a James Bond variety?,changelog,dccjti1,9,t5_2qhc9
10400004,0,t1_dcmoj99,gt A factor authentication email.factor already exists for admins. Apparently its just not worth the effort to roll it out to everyone Since you then have to deal with lost accounts,changelog,dcmwnz3,1,t5_2qhc9
10417882,0,t3_5okzbi,Thank you for removing good features.  What is next?  I enjoyed the mobile view on desktop because I could preview images and videos without having to go to another window. This is going to make me use more data with a lower QOL. This bullshit is since the desktop version is extremely bulky and full of crap.  I use a small window and this is what it looks like when trying to read comments on my smaller window  Hmm that is quality.  You are forcing us to not use a good feature. How about you remove some more QOL in the name of improvements.  Also you should have removed the button on the bottom under the Apps amp Tools that is to allow us to use the mobile version.,changelog,dcoxoce,9,t5_2qhc9

10978381,0,t1_decbpj5,It depends on the subreddit and individual thread. On ranime people sometimes like to make screencaps from episodes with a short comment which results in a lot of comments with links.,changelog,decdbcb,3,t5_2qhc9

11217811,0,t1_df333h3,Thats not really a tenable solution when this is rolled out to all of the subreddits. You would have to hide hundreds or thousands of them.,changelog,df3ix05,5,t5_2qhc9
11652862,0,t1_dgfychf,I wish subreddits could have tagscategories. I sure would love a filter thats just like any sports subreddit or any political subreddit. Theres a sports subreddit for every single team for every single sport and when a team wins rall is flooded with X WINS UPVOTE PARTY. Bleh,changelog,dggv762,3,t5_2qhc9
11768195,0,t1_dgty9ps,Yup. The moral of the story is that if the feature isnt compelling enough that a user actually wants to turn it on its probably not worth building. ,changelog,dgtyeva,3,t5_2qhc9
