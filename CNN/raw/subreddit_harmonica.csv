173439,0,t1_cey4xer,One of the PMs was an F and that one is not valved. The other is a high G and that one is. While the purpose of making it airtight for easier bends is cool it prevents overblows. So Id like to remove it at holes    and possibly  and . We are talking about a high G here so overdraws may not even be possible for me under the best circumstances.    Still a great deal and Im definitely getting more before theyre gone. I love the weight feel and look of the promaster.  ,harmonica,cey6rdf,2,t5_2rru3

411346,0,t3_1yoof4,This is definitely an issue. I live in a city too and you just have to be creative especially if you live with other people spouse roomates apartments. You should carry a harp on you at all times in case a practice moment comes up at an odd moment. For example frequently I used to be able to practice at the bus stop waiting for my bus unless someone else was at the stop too. When the weather is nice hit the park. Or better find a bridge or overpass and play under it. The acoustics are AMAZING. The entryways of abandoned buildings are also great and have good acoustics. But just be careful you dont get mugged. You are clearly resourceful and you will find a good fair weather spot in your city. You just have to be okay with the fact that at some point there will be people in or near your woodshed and that thats okay.      Right now because its so cold I cant get outside and I HAVE to play indoors. So I go in the bathroom and shut the doora nd play softly. Thats the most isolated place in my apartment and it seems to be working okay. I also just dont play at odd hours although I do play in the morning but not before am. At some point you HAVE to practice. Just try to do it as softly as possible..BTW You are doing the right thing being courteous to your neighbors because you are right that listening to someone practice an instrument is horrible. You want them to be blown away when they hear you play for the first time at the open mic not still annoyed that they had to listen to you do it for hours at a time!,harmonica,cfnehk4,1,t5_2rru3

1148920,0,t3_277swr,Like you I learned the harmonica as my first musical instrument coming from a background in rock drumming. I struggled for a few years on my own before I found youtube lessons that got me going. What YouTube didnt give me was a solid background in music theory. Three books really helped Harmonica For Dummies by Winslow Yerxa Improvising Blues Harmonica by David Barret and John Garcia and The Harp Handbook By Steve Baker. Other beginning harmonica books do have some theory but IMO dont really give you enough. For the record I am quite familiar with the books by John Gindick and David Harp among others which are probably the biggest sellers in beginning harmonica instruction. Now ten years later and probably an advanced player my advice to early learners who ask about the one instructional book they ought to buy I tell them without hesitation to buy Harmonica for Dummies. That is THE best beginningintermediate instructional book that I know. For players that want more I tell them to get Improvising Blues Harmonica which adds the next steps. From the foundation built by these two books youll have enough music theory to start figuring things out on your own...,harmonica,chyv7f7,1,t5_2rru3

2705923,0,t1_cnbl66n,An F harp plays second position in the key of C so its a nice versatile thing to have. Its said to go well with horns because that is a very easy key for most horn players to to play blues in. C for the rest of the band is D for many horns like tenor sax agruably the most common horn youll find in blues which is super easy... the D blues scale has almost no sharps or flats to contend withSome classic Blues Brothers jams often mix horns and harps check out songs like their version of Messin with the Kid and others for some examples. Lou Marini is a great sax man and of course Elwood can play some harp.C is always great harp to have plays second position in G and that GCD blues progression is pretty classic for blues and rock. It also represents the middle of the standard range of harp keys... most manufacturers offer low G or F through high F. So it gives you a nice midrange starting point that you can spread out from... no early struggles with hitting and bending higher notes. Its always the first key I go for when trying out new harps etc.If your goal is to jam the blues with a guitar player though I assume you know the player? If so I would try to find out what keys they prefer to play in if any and purchase accordingly. Just always remember most blues is played second position. So if the guitar player loves blues in E for example you want to grab an A harp and pity the poor horn player if you have one.,harmonica,cnbniwm,2,t5_2rru3

But more importantly find out what the Uke player like to play in keys that is.  If they only know how to play in E you can either play with an E harp or an A harp if you want to play simple folky songs the E would work but the A would have the right chords for playing a IIVV blues progression and such.

As for learning to replace t he reed yourself yes it is worth it if you plan to continue with Harmonica. As you learn to play you will get better at controlling your breath force and you wont blow out reeds as frequently. For example I havent blown a reed in about four years. But it will still happen from time to time and probably quite frequently in the beginning. Learning to replace reeds early on will save you money in the long run and will get you more familiar with how the instrument works. You can get a quality repair kit from Andrew and hes got a lot of free instructional materials on harp repair. Hes a great guy and will help you in any way he can...Best of luck!,harmonica,d4mcmoe,2,t5_2rru3
