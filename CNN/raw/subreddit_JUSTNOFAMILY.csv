Now the family has all learnt that to keep the peace we need to keep her happy. Yeah I  agree  mcs are tough  my moms had a couple and has said it was so hard to deal with. I havent had to experience that kind of grief but Im no stranger to other kinds of grief and tough experiences... and in tough times my stance has been suck it up and put on a smile while Ive been around others guess I expect that from others a bit too. ,JUSTNOFAMILY,cvxp5t2,5,t5_3a182

5486354,0,t1_cwcsgcc,Sibling rivalry. She can never be happy for your successes because they painfully remind her of her perceived failures. I have one of those sisters too. I have two college degrees and she has zero. She downplays my job constantly and talks shit about my career. Sheer jealousy on her part. Your sister may just be a little too sensitive to your familial success. I wouldnt accept her friendship requests if she ever regained her senses but I hold a grudge like a champ. If I were you I would go ahead and make it to where I couldnt see her stuff anymore either. Two can play that game. Hang in there.

But dont be afraid to belittle him like you would a flakey friend for your own emotional health.  Oh sure well totally meet up sometime but right now I gotta run!  Like it or not he is an emotional burden to you because you give him significance.  Youve got to forgive him within your own head before you can move on.  Forgiveness does not guarantee you make amends or trust him.  It means youve given up on him changing the past or his present maturity and moved on.  It should mean you fully accept that hes a manchild without getting upset over it.  You wouldnt let a child or significantly mentally disabled person watch your babies but you might let them think they have a chance because its easier than dealing with a tantrum.All of that or just got  no contact to free his burden from your thoughts.
