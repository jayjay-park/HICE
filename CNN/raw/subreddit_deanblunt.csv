6695053,0,t1_d0btl75,youre doing a good job man no complaints here other than the readability of the current theme tbh. this is probably the only sub i actively participate in where theres a really good amount of discussion to be had. sorry if this whole post was a bit shitty and maybe i shouldve pmed you about it but at the same time i guess it can be a thread where people can make their suggestions.the header is the snoo logo thing isnt it? i was thinking of the banner but the logo would also be cool if it was customized. do you mind giving me the size restrictions on both the banner and the header? ill post em on imgur once theyre done.,deanblunt,d0btrhk,2,t5_37kjr
