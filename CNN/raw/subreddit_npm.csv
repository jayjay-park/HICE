It normally helps to be actually doing this with a pull request surrounding some improvements. Other than that assuming the license allows for it you can always fork it make your changes and publish it to npm with a different name. If theres enough value in the additions Im sure some of the current users would follow your issue to the new repo and work from there. I dont believe npm would transfer ownership unless there was some sort of copyright claim but you could always drop them an email and see if theres any previous cases like this to be followed ,npm,d3ymxpg,3,t5_35v9f
