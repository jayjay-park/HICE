10709529,0,t1_ddkc0xc,I have never used Microsoft Project but. I wrote software like this in first year comp. sci. back in . Most projects have many tasks that have no dependencies. Critical path analysis is the major point of this sort of software finding which of these no dependency tasks must be started first to minimize project length. If it insists on a unique starting task you can put in a dummy one no prerequisite. Similarly a dummy end task as project complete. Make every task one hour or one day it shouldnt matter.I have only used Microsoft project once. The Office  version I think. I found it obnoxious it kept wanting me to tell it things it should be telling me.The other thing that comes to mind is tech trees or skill trees in games. It is exactly what you are doing and there are websites that have them online. It should be possible to just grab the Javascript and plug your own data in. Though that is more work albeit prettier.,jobbit,ddklvt7,2,t5_2qzdl
