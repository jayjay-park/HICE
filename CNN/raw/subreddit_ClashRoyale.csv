6255163,0,t3_4197bi,Minions  Minion Horde do well in arena  due do them not being able to be touched by melee. I ran valk in arena  but she fizzles out in arena  and is hardly used in  onward. Fireball is okay depending on what you are trying to do with this deck.I would say you need a witch goblin barrel or prince. Maybe replace knight with mini peeka. Muskateer is only great if she can burst down a tower otherwise she is destroyed easily by swarm and is wasted  elixer.Also minions hoard is very versatile if you play around arrows. It destroys big minions like giant prince balloons etc.,ClashRoyale,cz0n6tm,1,t5_3bog8
6274330,0,t1_cz2qf24,The way I prefer to play her is defensively if an air troop is approaching a tower I drop her right behind it.If a witch is approaching the tower I wait for the witch and skeletons to get to the tower and drop her at the witches side just as the witch takes her first shot and the tower deals with the skeletons.Then if the Musketeer escapes with over half a bar of health I immediately reinforce her and send her towards the enemy tower ,ClashRoyale,cz2tjrf,1,t5_3bog8

Its very hard to kill  and the bomb dropped on death will instakill every meleeshortrange unit used to take it down  including usuallytanky barbarians at nearfull HP.Taking down slow tanky units usually gives you a chance to counterattack but with the giant skelly all your troops are dead.Overlystrong epic cards risk ruining the game as theyre the purest of pure paywin.,ClashRoyale,d080ayf,7,t5_3bog8

The best ways to counter this card is zap fireball arrows freeze or a small elixir costing troop. My personal favorite is zap because you can get a  elixir trade from it.

6883554,0,t3_4a14y7,I just went from arena  to  in about a day with gobs prince baby drag barbs minion horde rocket spear god and skele army. The key feature of this deck is a nice versatile defense while having a nice split pushing power. The idea behind it is to never really counter push somebody. You want to defend and once you see them blow a bunch of elixer on something that isnt an instant threat you pair up a nice push on the opposite lane. Most of the time if you defend well and keep some defending creeps alive when they start to push the people in the earlier arenas instantly peak a red flag and go on the offensive. This allows you to send a strong push in the opposite lane when theyre least defended with no elixer.This also works well against spawner decks you mentioned since when they swarm a bunch of spawn buildings on one side which a lot of the players tend to do you can rush the other side and get a turret with your starting handelixer. Its quite satisfying and sometimes end up in them disconnecting D,ClashRoyale,d0wkf83,2,t5_3bog8

Basic combo is to send in knight just a split second before baby dragon and the knight will soak up the damage.

When setting up the combo I like to put up a tesla in the middle of the bridge to clear any threats and create a bulkhead then save to  elixir and drop xbow  some other beefy card giant skeleton giant at the same time. The Tesla pulls aggro for hogriders because the xbow is a tile back but a freeze card will let a hogrider kill the tesla AND take maybe  seconds out of the xbows lifetime if not killing it outright. The Hogrider also forces cheap removal that I probably wont end up having because I just spent  elixir.,ClashRoyale,d0yszo2,1,t5_3bog8

I just hit level  and Im at  trophies and Ive made it with this deck which is all about countering your opponents play then making a counter push. I started with a Baby Dragon and bought the Prince as soon as it popped up in the shop.Tesla Spear Goblins Minion Horde Barbarians Fireball Musketeer Prince Baby Dragon.This deck is a bit on the heavy side elixirwise so you have to be careful with how you play out your counters. Im not very good at describing how to play this but I always wait for my opponents move before playing. If Im capped on Elixir Ill drop my Tesla in the middle or stray Spear GoblinsMusketeer in one of the empty lanes to get either free damage or force him to do something. Counter big things like Giants Skeleton Giants and the such with Minion HordeBarbarians but you have to be careful for FireballArrows. If you see them empty out on Elixir drop your Prince on the other lane! Hes the main win condition in the deck.Anyway good luck! ,ClashRoyale,d0ze2fe,3,t5_3bog8

If you do an unstoppable push style I prefer to call it ramp up you dont need those cards at all well baby dragon is pretty useful for unstoppable push since it provides an extra tank for when your giant dies. You need to play defensive though till you get elixir advantage before you rush them down though.

6993973,0,t1_d18eba7,gt When do you decide to make a push? Once you have the elixir advantage or full elixir?Ideally.If you heard about counting cards at Black Jack its a bit similar here. Each time you counter something with something cheaper you try to keep a mental note of it a  Elixir Prince with a  Elixir Tombstone for example gives you  while an innefficient counter like a  Elixir Musketeer against  Elixir Minions would give you . Any time youre at an advantage and you hit  Elixir you can consider starting a big push like in the case of the deck I suggested Id start with Giant in the back wait to get to  again while Giant walks to the bridge and drop Musketeer Witch and maybe Spear Goblins and Minions but only if you dont expect an Arrows or Fireball.That said you cant only push in optimal conditions because if your opponent keeps putting pressure on you you may never attack which makes winning quite difficult.That means that some of your cards might have special conditions that allows them to be played efficiently without them being supported by other troops andor some cards can get a push started by themselves and get reinforced later. For example the Musketeer. Ill often wait longer to drop it in defense so the opponents troops are locked on my tower turning an otherwise innefficient counter into something better if the Musketeer eventually gets some damage in on a tower after defending. In other words the tower will take minimal damage but the Musketeer wont take any ideally so when its done clearing my opponents troops it will start pushing. A single Musketeer uncountered can easily deal  damage to a tower. If by the time the Musketeer reaches the bridge you happen to have  Elixir and know your opponent is still recovering from their last push adding a Witch even without a Giant to tank will force the opponent to drop something in defense.Thats where practice comes into play the more you play the better youll familiarize yourself with every card and how to counter them just like youll start noticing some popular combos and decks many people play you probably have already since you noticed cards you had trouble playing against. If you find a card that you cant possibly counter and which hurts you often enough to justify adapting your strategy dont hesitate to move some things around. For example at the rating Im playing a huge majority of decks play either XBows Huts or with Elixir Collectors so I play cards that counter those kinds of deck I played Rocket Goblin Barrel Tesla Bomb Tower Musketeer Giant Skeleton Arrows and Spear Goblins for the last month and just hit k rating yesterday!.I could keep going but long story short practice. And watch videos. TVRoyale is a great place to see good decks and players in action. You obviously wont have access to all their cards but once in a while youll see someone playing a deck made of cards you own. When that happens and if you feel like you could play that deck watch that video a few times and notice if you can see patterns of specific cards being used in specific contexts. There are also a lot of videos on YouTube with people explaining their decks and strategies.gt I cant get that strat to work at all. Im at the same place I was before win one lost one. I dont even know what Im doing wrong. Nothing works really starting to piss me offIts hard to tell without watching you in action. If youre in a clan try playing a decent clan mate and see if he can help you based on what he sees. It might only be an issue of timing and positioning. Like you mentioned never thinking about placing the Cannon in the middle before well in almost every case it is important to consider where you drop a troop. Against Giant Skeletons for example you always better attack them from the back let them cross the bridge before countering it otherwise your troops will explode when it dies but then again some times you have to sacrifice troops to prevent taking too much damage so its a matter of using the right troop at the right time to build an elixir advantage but also to drop the right troop at the right place in order to use said troops AND TOWERS efficiently.Youre also in a tough spot getting started when a lot of players have already been playing the game longer than you and have access to better cards andor are higher level. Just keep at it with time not only will you get better but your cards and towers will level up too. Just make sure youre always unlocking as many chests as possible to get more cards and gold and keep progressing. Sooner or later youll find new cards and unlock new possibilities as far as deckbuilding is concerned. As you level up not only will you get access to new cards but each chest will also contain more cards and gold which will snowball pretty fast.Sorry for the long read I just typed my stream of thoughts not sure if it all makes sense... Also I think Im a pretty defensive player refer to my main deck I listed above... lol and that works not only for me but also with the cards Im playing. Maybe another style of deck could be more suited for you...Looking at your cards again Im thinking you could play a Huts deck which aims to overpower an enemy with a swarm of troops. Youll be vulnerable to Fireballs and other spells Bombers and Bomb Towers but thats an effective type of deck at most levels as far as I know.Try playing Skeletons Spear Goblins Goblins Minions Cannon Barbarians Goblin Hut and Barbarian Hut. The idea is to play as many Huts as possible without making yourself too vulnerable obviously... and cycle through your cheap cards to get more Huts more often. The exact deck composition may vary but Im sure youll find examples of Hut decks being played on TVRoyale or YouTube if you want to check it out.Finally this post was very interesting to me and suggests archetypes rather than specific decks so you can mix and match yourself a deck based on his suggestions and what you have. Its worth the read probably more so than this wall of text... lol. Id check his post history too he probably has written a lot more great posts since I saved that one.Good luck and dont give up!

Ever wonder why? This is a result of the matchmaking system when playing in long sessions. You will be paired up against someone close to your level in the first few matches but usually when you continue to play more than  matches at a time you start getting paired up against tougher and higher level opponents. Regardless of whether you win or lose if you continue to play then you will continue to get paired up against tougher opponents. Ive tested this and many others have as well and have found it to be true. So if youre someone who plays in long sessions and wonder why you start going on a losing streak right after you were winning so much then this is why.Source ,ClashRoyale,d1k9xgx,1,t5_3bog8

In fact the balance issue is even worse in your version because the spell is basically  stronger at lvl  than at lvl  while currently freeze is roughly  stronger at lvl  than at lvl .I do not have a perfect solution  the only one that would make sense is to be unable to level up freeze so that it would max at lvl  but this is obviously going against Supercell marketing.The other way would be to add some damage to freeze and only increase with damage with the level but this is restricting the design space.,ClashRoyale,d1qxak4,3,t5_3bog8

If you stick to the deck and keep practising your card levels will improve as well as your skill with the deck. You may find small things in your deck you want to change or swap a couple cards but it doesnt really matter as long as your doing well.

7263880,0,t3_4ew1rd,Fun facts about M O R  T A R! Mortar has become a deck staple in some decks after the Xnow nerf. It has the power to spit hot fire almost anywhere on the map. Since Mortars like most targeting units will attack one unit until they die once they start firing at your tower they can easily be taken out by swarms. Like the Mortar in Clash of Clans the Mortar cannot fire within a short range of itself. Goblin Barrels make good counters to any mortars far back actually trying to be defensive. Like most buildings it can be raged. This will increase how often it fires at the cost of accelerating its lifespan. Mortars make great house pets.,ClashRoyale,d23uobl,19,t5_3bog8

7380934,0,t1_d2gc79k,I use fireball in order for the mirror match as well as against barbarians it also deals nicely with wizard and musketeer as the splash from bomb tower will often finish them. Id use bomb tower over cannon as the multi target aoe is insane against many hog decks as well as the tankiness. Once you hit around  I would suggest switching to inferno tower due to the abundance of double prince pekka. I like golem better than pekka as it doesnt get distracted from tower except for buildings as well as the three musketeers usually do the main damage to the tower once the golem has died and split into golemites. If you are able to make pekka work however with freeze I can definitely see that as viable. I would however replace cannon with bomb tower.,ClashRoyale,d2h5u0s,1,t5_3bog8

People complaining about Hog getting too strong now might have forgotten this game is supposed to be offense over defense.... Collector needed a HP nerf indeed. As a lvl  in Legendary Arena half of my opponents use it either as a wall or simply to give them huge elixir advantage once they have  at the same time. Fireballing a pump is now actually becoming useful... I hope Royal Giant will be playable now. With a splash unit behind it it could be great in fact. I believe Mortar did need a nerf thats one of the three main deck I face every day. ,ClashRoyale,d2mdlpf,1,t5_3bog8

7430031,0,t1_d2mevpc,I would think so as well but more and more companies rely on this type of model where  of the population supports the other .  I really dont get it.  If they made it worth spending  I would happily spend it as I enjoy the game and spend plenty of time playing it.  As it stands now even  would get me nowhere except a bunch of gold sitting there waiting for cards or possibly a few SMCs which could likely turn out to be full of royal giants skeletons and bomb towers which is a bad thing downwithbombtowers.I could easily see them apply skins type of model to the game similar to LoL and Dota have done to offer people something minor that would give them a feeling of uniqueness compared to everybody else.  The problem is that these types of models are more of a long term investment whereas Cash Royale has made them a boat load already so if we all suddenly lost interest tomorrow they would be just fine with that result.,ClashRoyale,d2mqwxu,2,t5_3bog8

7432741,0,t3_4h1nma,Hog doesnt really need to be nerfed. It falls under the category of cards that can only be used offensively it has no defensive benefit other than maybe pulling.It is the cheapest siege troop so it is one of the few ways to ensure at least some damage to the enemy crown tower. Consequently it dies to everything since it doesnt hit back.It must be kept in mind that cards like barbs can be used defensively against it take no damage and launch a counter attack. Meaning against somebody properly defending against hog all they get is maybe  hits on the tower at a time.Hog freeze decks aim to get around that by freezing and getting like  hits.Hog  zap tries to improve consistency from    to about   .If you defend well against a hog freeze then they spend  elixir to deal like    hits while not damaging your troops at all. Similar with zap. Setting you up for a big counter push if you have a deck that can do that.Im fp and play a hog cycle deck at  trophies in my experience the primary reason hog decks win so much is because people dont pack enough cheap dps to kill it every time it comes or if they can counter it they dont have particularly good pushing options to turn the balance of tower hp in their favor leading to just waiting for another hog rush.A big mistake against hog decks or in general is over defending with units that cant be used to launch counter attack like dropping cannon  goblins or goblins  skeletons when you only need  of them. ,ClashRoyale,d2n20ej,3,t5_3bog8

7433372,0,t1_d2n3gfu,Most of the higher level players already agree that the bomb tower is trash. Its only a problem when you dont have a huge card diversity. It does not need a nerf as it already provides no utility for counter attacking like minion horde or barbs would. The bomb tower shuts down attacks but so does giant skeleton freeze rocket barbs minion horde poison lightning fireball and so on but it cant touch enemy towers no matter how much health it has or how long it lasts.,ClashRoyale,d2n4la6,2,t5_3bog8

It is expensive but works extremely well on Mortar and Spawner users something thats pretty common nowadays.

I got past Arena  as a level  but it was super frustrating considering like  of my opponents were level  with a clear advantage in card levels. Im facing a similar issue in Arena  now. At least  of my opponents now have at least  cards and a couple even have . The last week or so my only focus has been getting my main cards to .

7520145,0,t3_4i9gqv,Heres a way they could buff the card.Instead of spawning all  skeletons at once it would be a lot stronger if the skeletons spawned in waves of  every second for  seconds. Kinda like rage but it rains skeletons for the duration.

7522419,0,t3_4idwu6,Well basically reached my ultimate goal as a FP player with using only commons at lvl and rares at lvl excl. Hog at lvl. I know its not that huge of a deal cause we see such topics like  times a day but for me doing it with low lvled cards means a lot more than doing it as a lvl  player with lvl  commons and lvl  rares for example. Proof Was floating between  for like  weeks until I managed to upgrade my main damage dealer the Hog from lvl  to lvl . The difference was that the hog was managing to survive a lvl  cannon or lvl  Barbarians and make at least one hit on the tower which wasnt possible with the lvl  Hog. Feel free to ask any questions about strategy weak and strong points of the deck etc cause I think I really managed  to master every single detail of it was playing it after I reached   trophies.P.S. I reached the Legendary arena on Thursday but didnt have time to post or play a lot. With the  commons per day I managed to upgrade my Barbarians to lvl  as well and the game definitely feels a lot easier now. Currently after around  games managed to maintain my position and am floating around the  mark.

I think these decks can both counter it just depends on if they can get the push build setup... In which case I just cry.

Just replace one of the weaker troops with the second spell...In the end its all about how you prefer to play and what works for you! GL!Edit and ofc its about using your card levels to the max.

I play at  and see a variety of deckscards although yes there are a lot of royal giants. I think the balancing has been pretty good though and i like it better than the hog zap meta.Royal giant costs  elixer and o ly targets buildings so it better have a pretty big impact when played but yet it is still counterable. I am not a royal giant user or hog user never was a mortar xbow or defensive buildingsdirect damage user either and manage to still enjoy this game and win quite a lot too even when im underlevelled against most opponents. I think people need to work on their decksgameplay before calling for nerfs and complaining.,ClashRoyale,d30t3em,6,t5_3bog8

I dont know.That aside If everyone would win as much as they lose no one would progress in this game. People would be stuck where they are. If one goes on a winning streak automatically someone else is going on a losing streak.They could be implementing this to make you feel good when you climb and then frustrated when you fall. If this would rotate among players Everyone would get a high and feel good and afterwards get a low and feel bad thus pressing players to invest to get to the high again. There is a certain logic behind this.Again I dont know if its true but you cant argue that a system like that wouldnt be profitable to Supercell. Frustrated players will grab their wallet and try to chase the high point again.Ive seen it multiple times in my Clan. People who get frutrated somehow feel the need to drop money to maintain their higher Trophy Count and consequently Supercell earns more. It would work.

7611802,0,t1_d37ehf3,Your math is off. Lets stick with both at level  for this. Pump has  HP Fireball is  damage. Pump will decrease by  so lets make its new number  HP.Elixir lasts  minute  seconds and produces at a . rate. This timer starts as soon as its deployed. But as buildings operate they lose health. Pump loses HP at a rate of roughly  HP per second. In order to produce one Elixir the Pump needs to have at least  HP. Lets keep this stored for later.All right Pump is placed Fireball comes in. Wham. Its Now at  HP. It gets its first Elixir.  HP has been removed from its life. Its now at  HP. Another  HP has been removed. Were now at . Last one we end it with about  HP. No more Elixir can be produced.Its its lifetime the Pump has produced  elixir. The opponent has lost  Elixir as a result as well as a little Tower HP and whatever push strategy he had in mind. Fireball user loses  elixir and nothing else.Conclusion Dont bother using Fireball unless theres two pumps next to each other and neither has produced its rd Elixir yet.But theres also one more bit. If someone is using Elixir Pumps behind their towers theyre usually extremely dependent on their success. There are some decks that play better if both players have low elixir than if both players have high elixir. ,ClashRoyale,d37f7fa,2,t5_3bog8

7628228,0,t3_4jssrp,To be honest I hate the current meta. However that is not to say I do not abuse it. It doesnt take a lot of effort to adjust to it as you are saying. I only switched two cards in my deck for the last update one of them being mini pekka which was still a lvl  at the time. Gold is much easier to come by due to the daily match bonuses and I have adjusted to the meta and risen from my previous best of  to  where I am currently floating around. Hogs and Royal Giant are fairly boring to play against always though lol. In terms of fluctuation I usually float  trophies from  so it hasnt been too bad. currently a lvl  ftp with lvl  and  commons lvl  and  rares. I believe all the balance changes to be fair although the miner really didnt need the buff the filthy gold digger.  Currently playing with the decks in this post I made A final point the update did cause me to fall from  to . However I watched the TV Royale replaysthose still in the top  mostly and saw how other people were having success countering the royal giant. If the meta didnt change with updates the game would get stale. While it does require a gold investment even for us FTP it keeps the game fresh which is why Im still waiting for the hog nerf. ,ClashRoyale,d39ae81,9,t5_3bog8

7645292,0,t1_d3ap8u4,you can replace the witch with something to win the enemys defensive pekka like freezerage. Your deck cant kill backlines effectively and has no hog protection so Id recommend putting barbs if using rage or valk if using freeze in there.Try placing the elixir collector in the front if your starting hand does not include barbs or regular gobs place the elixir collector in the front or else right in front of the king tower to avoid being fireballed. See what the opponent cards are if the enemy dropped a RG then barbs if you have it. You could also drop valk behind the RG and wait for pekka to build a counter push followed up by wizard or pekka first in front of the RG and wizard behind the pekka or valk behind the RG to avoid spam.Counter push using the Pekka  valk  wizard if you use rage rage it but if you use freeze play reactively. A common counter is to drop barbs on the wizard to shut down the push you freeze it its not gonna scratch the wizard. If you played it correctly the freeze can reach the tower in order to surround the wizard the pekka is gonna go quite far therefore the enemy will drop barbs between the pekka and the wizard then you can also freeze the tower. Double gobs to cycle lure kill hogs and tank the inferno if you use zap instead of arrows.,ClashRoyale,d3b88ib,1,t5_3bog8

7650908,0,t1_d3bpazn,For my experience I wouldnt say it gets worse. If you stick to the same deck for a whole time and only upgrade those cards then you will get more and more excess gold. Advancing in arenas and getting better chests helps too of course. Im currently fp  trophies with k unused gold sitting there.I could spend the gold trying out new cards if needed. I can even use different cards even if they at a lower lvl to try them and not worry about dropping to a lower arena not going to lose  trophies in a sitting. Of course I had to stick to the same deck from pretty much  trophies in order to save this much gold so the game does discourage you from switching card too much. But my advice is to experiment early and only when you find your deck is not working out. Once you find that great deck and stick to it the excess gold will start coming and give you more flexibility in the future.,ClashRoyale,d3bv6cr,1,t5_3bog8

Once I start pushing with PEKKA I usually knock them off balance enough they cant do a lot more than solo hog or intentionally lose a tower.I usually play baby dragon from the middle with other stuff on bridge behind PEKKA so horde plays hurt unless I prediction arrows but baby dragon almost always gets  hits in on tower after killing horde since PEKKA tanks enough to wipe the horde  other cheap troops.,ClashRoyale,d3c14ip,1,t5_3bog8

7691237,0,t3_4ko81a,Tier  Miner Rapidly taking control of the meta I still think he still has unrealized potential. He can be used to build a deck around or as an additional threat in almost any existing deck.Tier  Princess amp Ice Wiz These cant be used as deck centerpieces but they are both amazing. Ice wiz is possibly the best defensive card in the game but is fairly useless on offense without a tank in front. Princess is a musthave in any siege deck and a great filler card in any deck and is a constant elixir drain on opponents without oneTier  Lavahound I feel like he could be elevated to tier  once people figure out new ways to play him but hes still great card to build a deck around that is difficult for most people to counter. Getting one of these early can immediately take you to Royal Arena.Tier  Sparky I think as a wincondition she needs a buff but were starting to see some interesting uses in other decks like RG.,ClashRoyale,d3gg04u,4,t5_3bog8

Ive also just been playing a lot and experimenting with a lot of different decks and I think Ive finally created a very solid deck for the current meta.Im still not amazing with elixir management but as a rule of thumb I try to use as little elixir as possible to defend a push and launch a counter push.I learned how to quick drop and how to tap to deploy a card instead of drag and drop its practically second nature by this point and thats helped me immensely. I have also learned to keep certain cards in my hand in case I need them for a possible counter push has saved me so many times and that spell timing while pushing down a lane can more than often get you a tower. And on the other side of that while you push with smaller troops try to spread them out so that you dont get fireballed and lose your momentum.Those are just a few tips that I have recently learned that has helped me a lot with winning just yesterday I went from about   !,ClashRoyale,d3izjg0,3,t5_3bog8

You just drop something slow and dumb near your King Tower watch it crawl up to the river then crap down some little ranged guys behind it.Thats what you sound like right now.As a HogCycler I have to very carefully manage my elixir precisely because of guys like you so understand that Im coming from a place of respect for the way you play. My MiniPekka has your name on it because I cant clean up your Wizard with small troops. My Minions have your name on them because I need that air damage to counter your Barbs. My Double Gobs have your name on them because I have to distract your Pekka somehow. My Musketeer has your name on it because your Dragons air splash will kill anything else.Im not just dropping units willynilly to cycle back to the Hog Rider. I know it feels that way to you and its supposed to feel that way to you because my main source of damage is starting a push when I think youre not prepared for it.

If you deploy  musketeers and theyre instakilled you know that next time you should try to split them up or bait the fireball first. Its kind of the nature of the whole game you dont know  what your opponent has until youve tried out a few things first. Youre constantly gathering information and analyzing it in a short timespan. Personally I understand the argument of wanting to know the spell levels but I dont think its needed. Knowing which spells the opponent is playing has a much bigger effect on my strategy. ,ClashRoyale,d3qxu9d,1,t5_3bog8

7805580,0,t3_4m845m,Watch your step on the way out...Your first point is ridiculous. If you keep winning obviously the game will end up matching you against people who are higher level than you just like if you keep losing it will match you against lower level people. Thats the whole point of having a matchmaking system. Further a  level difference might be hard to overcome but as far as a single level difference is concerned you can always win by outplaying them andor playing a deck thats suited to counter theirs. Player and card levels arent everything.As for your second point I just dont get it. There are people who didnt spend a dime on this game who are in Legendary Arena just like there are people who spent hundreds still stuck in Arena ... There are people who got lucky and had a free SMC or more but even then if that SMC is full of Mortars and XBows what good was it?The game is balanced if you reach tournament rules levels and participate in tournaments. Beyond that whoever is the luckiest andor plays the best andor spends the most will obviously be advantaged as is generally the case in every game. It takes roughly  months to reach that level without spending any money unless youre playing  different epics in your deck obviously...In the end if youre having fun keep playing if not dont.

7807305,0,t1_d3tkyau,this is the biggest issue with the game besides the meta being incredibly boring and easy to playincreibly unforgiving if you dont play perfectly.

Drop level  minion horde welp now i got to zap and arrows. get really good counter push off of a mistake opponent made lol nah Ill just drop my level  valk and stop all of your full health troops. You have to drop extra troops to counter and eventually the advantage just tilts to them. In this current meta its so apparent. If your towers are  levels above mine have a lot more HP you can literally just turtle throw your level  commons at me until I have to drop extra then just throw your level  hog after  or  freezes one tower is dead and opponent can just turtle. worst part is losing  trophies on a game like this that is almost impossible to win if the opponent is at least somewhat competent and doesnt just blindly throw mistakes every other play. ,ClashRoyale,d3tlqql,5,t5_3bog8

7847000,1,t1_d3xvyyw,I mention this briefly in my above post but its actually possible to at a high enough tower and zap level prevent a horde from reaching your tower. Its pretty tricky since you have to time it just as the tower fires the first shot so zap kills one minion and the horde takes up an area close to the size of the zap spell so be accurate. It does net a big elixir advantage however.,ClashRoyale,d3y2lem,1,t5_3bog8

7857643,0,t3_4mybca,The bomb is what makes this card special. The Giant Skeleton can easily be countered by a few elixir worth of small troops making it important to support him for a good push. On defense insane value can be made by deploying the giant skeleton in front of a strong trooptargeting push especially against  musks. The bomb instantly destroys all of the units making for great value.

Specially because unlike golem she doesnt split in two I think in OP decks she should be the first epic to upgrade.I think with smart purchases it is possible to level up epics as my PEKKA is almost level  and I have spent less than  but most of it was to buy gold,ClashRoyale,d3za83n,1,t5_3bog8

7876999,0,t1_d41eqly,Sure when I made it into legendary this was my deckHog  actually I just double checked and it was still  when I made it in  Freeze   Zap   Fireball   Barbs   Goblin spears   Inferno   Elixir   I have since replaced fireball with Princess but that was after I got into legendary. Try to play defensively for a while drop ECs defend with barbsinferno etc. Ideally your hog pushes comes on a counterpush with some surviving goblin spears and barbs. Avoid using freeze offensively until you built up a big elixir lead even if that means biting the bullet on a  elixir trade with your hog against his cannon. A good freeze push will have more than just the hog to really take full advantage of the freeze.A good offensive push towards the end of the game might look something like this. You push with hog and goblin spears. He drops barbs. You freeze his barbs and tower. He drops goblins. You zap his goblins. He drops minions. You fireball his barbs minions and tower in one shot. Its very tricky to use with only  troop cards. And hog is an offense only card too so at times its more like . However all your spells can be used defensively or offensively. Goblin spears is super versatile card able to be used whenever even alone on offense to chip dmg. Once you get used to it its a very strong deck. ,ClashRoyale,d41g42e,1,t5_3bog8

I see constant complaints on the front page and assume thats just what its like without actually having my own experience in legendary arena to base my opinion on.

A  elixir cannon literally renders the hog useless and the majority of the time the cannon prevents the hog from getting a single hit off on the tower.  If youre talking about hoggob pushes or hoganything combos theyre still easily counterable with almost any card.  Sure you might give up a hit or two on your tower but you just got an elixir advantage to make an even stronger counter push.  ,ClashRoyale,d476dvn,2,t5_3bog8

7987997,0,t3_4ok09u,of course not.because before I saw  hog decks and  RG. Now were gonna see  RG and  hogs.At least the hogs have my counters and actually require a bit of skill when the opponent has a good counter. RG is guaranteed to cause dmg to a tower which can be something like  if you dont have any buildings in your deck. playing RG requires  skill there is no way to place it wrong and everybody puts it in the right place. The support is also pretty hard to mess up... thats the cards that annoy me not OP combinations that require SKILL but cards that require absolutely  skill like the bomb tower was before...,ClashRoyale,d4dxdze,2,t5_3bog8

7988904,0,t3_4ojw0p,Alright Supercell i love this game but you just keep messing up with this the game every update which leads to another update which usually sucksSo let me break it down why Hog Rider is currently the top choice for tower destruction! While we really enjoy seeing more offensive and actionpacked games wed ideally like to see a bigger range of offensive cards used  Ya i do agree but what about the Royal Giant it is the top choice for tower destruction in arena  and  and is goddam OP the Hog is good but not OP. Unlike the Hog which takes more skills to play and easy to counter the Royal Giant has huge health and range. People just put down the Royal GG  and it will do the job usually without skills. Another reason is that it is too easy to get the second tower or going for  crown since its unpredictable where the royal giant would land. Either way buiding defenses are pretty much useless. Such and OP card. THE NEXT GODDAM MORTAR EVEN MORE OP AND MUCH BETTER THAN THE EPIC XBOW as least it takes skills to play those  cards  . So i suggest nerf its health. The witch Our previous change didnt get her to the viable level we were hoping for. This change will Well its true that the witch deserves atention but the fact that it spawn skeletons already makes the card good compare to the wizard  Elixirs. Now when you buff it you expect people to use it in different strategies however it encourages people to use certain strategies usually with tanky troops like the Royal GG or the Golem which are already OP cards in my opinion therefore they basicly narrow down the offensive variations that Supercell is hoping to get The Lava Hound itself isnt scary enough right now  compared to the pups  and can sometimes be ignored Now this explanation is just plain stupid. Why?  Cuz of course the true power of the Lava Hound is the Pups so it is obvious the Pups are scarier and can cause real trouble as its state right now. Perhaps Supercell is loving their tank cards too much right now. Skeletons They offer too much distraction and damage value for  Elixir! This one is just ridiculous. Talking about tank cards one of the best card to counter them is Skeletons. They offer great value for  Elixir can be used as a distraction cycling the deck or even taking out troops namely Hog Mini Pekka Princess... It is a great card but not an OP one since it can be easily taken out with shooting units or splash units namely witch wizard ice wizard musketeer baby dragon valkyrie dark prince. If you want to nerf it Supercell then nert its health and damage taking away  skeleton grants the Mini Pekka a tanky troop one extra shot on the tower and keeps the Miner yes also a mini tank alive for longer period The Miner is already OP at the moment with too much health.  Cannon Hitpoints decreased by  Tesla Hitpoints increased by Wed like to see the Cannon and Tesla as interchangeable options depending on your deck preference and needs. Currently the Cannon offers more value and is the clear choice. This change will hopefully make the decision more interesting. This obviously means f the Cannon use the Tesla. It is obvious the Cannon is too good for the Hog but is it good enough for the Royal Giant even the Tesla is no match for the Royal Giant doing this may make the Cannon disappear in the arenas.In conclusion the tank units Royal Giants Pekka Mini Pekka Miner Lava Hound Golem are receiving too much love with this update. If this goes live the tanks mentioned will dominate the arenas in the end Supercell may ended up making no progress  on making variations to the offensive playstyle. Perhaps they need more time playing the actual game to truly know what is happening inside the arenas. Please upvote if you agree with me thank younerftheroyalgiant  ,ClashRoyale,d4e12ce,0,t5_3bog8

Ive learned that I have an angry side mom dont talk to me Im playing clash its not you Im angry at and its not always who I want to be. After my blood cools down and I think back to what happen its important to realize its just a game. However Ive also learned about other people. I know the game claims about the emotes as making the game more human but what does that teach us. It either means we are all have twelve year old rmaturities and spam the thanks after every win or that we are purpously cruel and non respectful to people we dont know. When Asian letters pops up and I dont know how to even begin how to read that I can translate the thanks and the laughing at me from halfway across the world. The memes can be fun but some change needs to reflect more emotions and more of what makes us human. A good eyeroll or sorry youre having a bad day or just a simple question mark when they send a good game after they laid you out in  seconds. Cause we both know that was a train wreck.

Having pump means you are trying to play a control deck. but given you have the advantage of level you could just go for beat down. if you want to give it a try swaping pump with spear gob archers or skele. play witch or arches at the back  to see what the opponent does and you can counter it with the spells cannon and barbs.If you play witch you could go for the beat down instead of defending play RG and minions at the bridge with witch support.you could also play RG at the back if you have cannons and barbs in hand but make sure you only play RG at the back when you have  elixir.alternatively you can swap pump for gob huts play the hut in the middle all the time it stops hog and RG dead. Do you know what the Chief pat deck is? RG pump hut barbs fireball cannon arrows and spear gobs. I played this deck but replaced the pump with witch before the witch buff and it worked well in A. watch his want to play exactly his deck. i found it hard to defend against pekka and golem decks but the witch swap made it easy to defend against allgood luck if you have any question ask.,ClashRoyale,d4jjsfk,2,t5_3bog8

8055856,0,t3_4pjitg,Instead of just asking for a new deck which likely wont help much focus on learning how troops interact with each other. Pick a deck and stick with it until you master it. The game revolves around building a push and defending the counter push. Watch the replays and dont only focus on your play. You can learn a lot by watching how the opponent counters your cards.As for your deck its very high cost your main push should be between  elixir. More than that and you wont be able to generate mana fast enough to defend. Giant witch are a solid combo add a fireball or minions and you have a solid push. Another insight is that you have  units in your deck that are succeptable to fireballpoison. If you never group them up its fine but as soon as a witch and wizard stack you will get fire balled and loose  elixir.,ClashRoyale,d4ljyol,8,t5_3bog8

8060315,0,t3_4plya8,I used to use Jasons deck but with the current meta I had to swap out a few cards. Swap arrows  for zap Pump for fireballZapfireball is incredibly versatile as it can take out defensive troops of same levelmusketeerwizardbarbarians clumped with gobs near the tower to allow the giant to reach it. Also eats the  musketeer for  elixir advantage. Also if the opp has an inferno tower zap it and send the horde.I feel pump should be removed as the miner completely ruins it and I would rather have AOE spells to generate elixir advantage.Also if you feel that barbarians are clunky or vulnerable to enemy splash or fireballs try swapping them for a mini pekka as it is more efficient and chops down both RG and hogs with gobs for support.Hope this helps ,ClashRoyale,d4m1zpp,3,t5_3bog8

8170277,0,t1_d4ysee0,Ice wiz and princess dont outright win you the game like sparky does if you dont have counters to it. Thats my problem with the card. Since a game can be won off of killing a single tower and then just turtling up having a card that if it gets one shot off on the tower takes out more than  of its hp is too snowbally. At least with the royal giant you have time to recover because its going to take a while to kill your turret and it cant defend itself. A sparky can defend itself especially if your opponent doesnt have freeze or zap and especially if you drop a wizard behind it which eliminates the minion hoard counter as well.,ClashRoyale,d4yu17x,-1,t5_3bog8

Thats why barbarians dont need a fix  its just that your level  barbarians get reduced to tournament cap same as a level  barbarian of a PW user..

8186059,0,t1_d50r8c5,Im sorry but Im pretty sure your math is not correct. Unless Ive misunderstood you then I apologize!In order to get the achievement you have to complete and host a tourney. That means  person   tourney. Lets disregard the length of the tourney for now assuming everyone will fill it no matter the length.A few seasons ago I was in low legendary arena at  trophies and I was ranked . The arena was pretty full to about  trophies so thats  people trophies or trophy. Assuming Arena  and up is filled with mostly level  and s thats  Arena    Arena    Arena    Arena    trophies   people  trophy     Arena    people. This number is actually an underestimate because I assume there are more people at lower trophy ranges than in Legendary Arena.If we assume each person hosts a  person tourney that means there are roughly     tourney spots from FP players alone.Now this suggests that each player can compete in  tourneys at least before all FP players have been exhausted.As I said before this approximation is an underestimate so I would bet that the actual number is closer to  tourneys. This also assumes each player only hosts  free tourney and it is only a  person tourney.If Supercell does nothing I dont believe we will be looking at a tourney desert in the next few months.EDIT I wrote  tourneys but it should be  if you could the one the player hosted,ClashRoyale,d50t3wl,0,t5_3bog8

Also I doubt any authorities are going to waste their time busting up a local MtG event with a  buyin whereas a mobile game with millions ? of players could conceivably be a target if they thought they were running afoul of gaming laws. Bottom line is that Supercell themselves gave this justification for why they set up tournament mode the way they did so Id assume someone there who is more of an expert than we are made the determination that there was too much risk to have players providing the buyin for the tournaments.,ClashRoyale,d518966,1,t5_3bog8

8198582,0,t3_4rkjyn,The Miner is ridiculous. Currently I use a makeshift version of the  legendary deck IWprincessminer as I do not have the princess. This deck got me into legendary as a level  with ..x cards.I believe that the miner singlehandedly makes large push decks irrelevant. This deck crushes large push decks at the point where it is near broken. These decks have high average elixir cost so when a miner followed by shanks comes down the lane it is near impossible to deny hundreds to even thousands of damage. When a pump is placed the miner destroys it. The miner also crushes spawner decks. A minershank push if left unattended can drop a dower. Whenever I send a push like this I have never run into a counter that results in a negative elixir trade for me. The only way to prevent any damage is to use more elixir than me. I am going to admit this and it pains me to say this to my beloved miner but the miner needs a nerf. Of course since it is a legendary it still has to be incredibly good. Since the main function of the miner is to be a minitank and to destroy passive building its hitpoints should remain the same. What really needs to be changed is its chip damage to crown towers which is near impossible to prevent. If ignored it can do over  chip damage. Over the course of the match this adds up and during double elixir the miner spam becomes as bad as the mortar was way back. I propose that its crown tower damage reduced by a mere  but damage overall increased by  or . This would make the knight a feasible option for a mini tank while the miner fills a more antibuilding role. I feel like these changes would balance the miner a bit more.,ClashRoyale,d52djwq,1,t5_3bog8

For tournaments those are  and for max levels  commonsraresepicslegendarys.That means that a lvl  epic is equivalent to a lvl  rare and lvl  common.I have to agree with the post though epics are way too hard to level later on leaving them outpowered to higher level commons.I buyed every Pekka from the shop for  months until I managed to get it to lvl. That is equivalent to lvl  commons. The Pekka oneshots lvl  barbs making them uneffective. However lvl  barbs destroy my Pekka since she no longer oneshots them. I would have to Zap the barbs to make it work. However I started facing lvl  barbs. That is an autolos for my Pekka since even with Zap my Pekka doesnt kill them. I have One rare already on lvl  and my Pekka is still on  for the next upgrade.

It honestly has to have one of if not the lowest usage rates and with the addition of Lumberjack people who managed to get both have no reason to use the rage spell. I hope they find a way ton tweak the card to make it actually viable.

The problem lies with FP in that statistically you should get about  per month as is.  If I played this game for  years Id go  months without getting any followed by  in a single day all to level out to  or  per month.  But nobody is going to play this game for  years so youre going to get lots of people who hit their lucky streak right off to average out the people like me who havent got any in  months as the sample size is just much too small.  This change would do a much better job of balancing the odds out to about  per month for everyone while still encouraging people to buy everything and play as much as possible.  ,ClashRoyale,d5898c1,1,t5_3bog8

8304943,0,t3_4t9wtz,Actually legendaries have pretty much resparked my interest in the game. This time  weeks ago I was down at  after going on a huge tilt from . On the day of the update I was excited about the tournament feature and after spending most of the day trying to get into the tourney week I decided to join regular ones hosted by normal people. I won my first two tournaments and on my second tournament I got an ice wizard from the chest.This ice wizard literally carried me from  back to  with a  win rate. Its so overpowered on defense it is not even funny. So by friday the tournament week is pretty much over but I actually got into Ash  cr and coc tournament. I didnt place too well but I did get an  card chest. And out of that chest I got a miner. This opened up a whole new playstyle to me the cycle playstyle which I never got to experience before because my hog rider is serverly underleveled. And then on sunday I got a second miner out of a silver chest allowing for an upgrade. So I was just winning matches left and right and I quickly got back up to . And then on wednesday days ago I got a princess from my crown chest and then  hours later a sparky from a tournament chest again. I decided to make a  legendary deck utilizing sparky to use in tournaments at the beginningto troll so to speak but that princess unlocked so many deck styles for me.And then just about  minutes ago I got a lumberjack from a giant chest. In just those short minutes I have had lots of fun using that rage in combination with some cheap troops to absolutely decimate people.TlDR Legendaries actually did bring me lots of fun and reinvigorated my love for this game.,ClashRoyale,d5fob15,3,t5_3bog8

8320180,0,t1_d5hjpr4,While my original post is probably pretty salty I respectfully disagree with your optimism with Supercell. This is not a week turnaround as this has been a problem since Legendary Arena was created now it just affects more people than ever. My frustrations also stem playing Supercell games for around  years now and still being frustrated with some of their actions or inactions. For example Clan Wars was the greatest addition to Clash of Clans. It added a completely new dimension to the game and allowed people to actually bond with their clanmates to work toward a common goal. However about  months in it became clear that some clans were good and looking for more and better comptetition while others were doing it just casually and for fun. Then the more serious dedicated side began to plead for one thing and one thing only Clan War challenges where one clan could guarantee a way to face another specific clan that consented to war with them. A year and a half later we have Townhall . We have Bowlers. We have friendly battles. But still no clan challenging system or even an explanation for why they never gave it to us. Instead Supercell watched as it became a pretty nasty battle between Fairplay and modding clans allowing the community to get pretty toxic. They even waited another year for good measure to really crack down on modding.TLDR. The problem I brought up isnt one that just started its been a problem for awhile now and Supercells past has shown that there is a very small chance that theyll do much about it.,ClashRoyale,d5hku98,2,t5_3bog8

8385523,0,t1_d5ppzcd,Thanks. What is your deck right now? Trophy range? Oh god I hate the Zap meta. Its one of the main reasons why Valkyre  MiniPekka  Fire Spirits can get shutdown easily if played carelessly. About the Inferno I think its necessary for tanks especially the RG as if I remove it Ill be depending too much on MiniPekka. Also it can easily take care of a Hound deck so there. I dont usually prefire arrows as the Baby Dragon can usually stall the Horde long enough for me to fire Arrows or I just send in the Fire Spirits with them. Expensive but I dont use it unless I get a lead or my opponent over commits.Which tank do you think I should replace? Removing Valkyre makes defending Tank pushes with Inferno much harder as its easier to distract it with cheap swarms. Replacing Baby Dragon would make prefiring Arrows necessary as Fire Spirits alone cant take out a Horde completely and Ill have a relatively weak antiair defence. ,ClashRoyale,d5pqlny,1,t5_3bog8

8390412,0,t1_d5q8naa,gtgt The day Supercell engineers a card specifically to provide an Elixir advantage is the day I leave the game.gt The Elixir Collector?The Fireball?Either way I should rephrase what i said before. The Elixir Collectors sole purpose is to give the user extra Elixir yes. There are many counters to this but your point is valid all the same. But the Bombers main purpose isnt to provide an Elixir advantage. It has one of the highest splash damage attacks alreadywhy should it be more powerful? Its already a damn useful troopanyone who says otherwise is mad. While it is far from the strongest card its still up there.Some cards are designed to be highrisk and fairly so. Take the Minion Horde an incredibly deadly elixir set of  Minions that can be killed using elixir Arrows. Theres your risk. You are hoping that your opponent doesnt have Arrows on hand.I dont personally believe that the Barbarians share the same high risk. They have many small weakness but no particular massive one not including spells of course. I dont think its fair to make a elixir set of allaround Barbarians have such an easy weakness.,ClashRoyale,d5qcktb,2,t5_3bog8

If you have Level  Guards Id give that a try. Theyre not terribly easy to replace in this deck as Barbs are quite a bit more expensive and stab gobs can be zapped.   The previous popular GiantPoison deck was GiantMiniPekkaIce WizardMusketeer or ArchersCannonPumpZapPoison. Using buildings like the cannon has become less popular though people are now more willing to take extra tower damage in exchange for having a stronger counterpush.  I myself am currently using the budget version of Clydes deck GiantBarbsMiniPekkaMinionsSpear GobsPumpZapPoison. Once the Princess shows up in the shop Ill sub her and Skellies in for Minions and Spear Gobs. The IW doesnt make a ton of sense in this iteration though since you already have very strong defense. Maybe this helps you understand the way in which GiantPoison decks are being built thus helping you to figure out a version that works for you. Either way make sure you sub in Poison for Arrows as its the far superior card both in this deck and in general. I made it to A with a level  Poison.,ClashRoyale,d5vsuv9,3,t5_3bog8

Imo musketeer outclasses wizard by like a mile for its cheap cost longer range and good output damage.

8601730,0,t1_d6gsiw5,I havent played ladder in a week still waiting for P to show up.  I might just take Ice Wiz as well at this point.  I found a couple of games with Inferno from my tourney matches but those guys are really low level.  Like .  So their placement wasnt ideal but it wouldnt have mattered though as the counters are still the same.A big tip is treat Inferno like Sparky.  Unless you can drop Skels safely and have them tank for your Giant always save a Zap to deal with the Inferno.  I usually determine if I can beat the tower by seeing if I can Zap the tower before half HP for Giant and after Zap he needs to be punching the Inferno.  You never Zap before he punches or can punch it because most likely you wont make it and its a wasted Zap.  You want the time Giant is exposed to Inferno to be the same before and after Zap.  This means the Inferno will never ramp up enough in both phases to do max damage.Having elixir advantage is what allows the aggressive play.  So you have to learn to tank with Giant to start your push or take tower damage and start with a full health Musket.  My favorite are lone Ice Wizards as I usually drop my Giant as they cross the bridge the Ice Wizard does no damage to Giant while slowing him down allowing more elixir build up and the tower kills the Ice Wiz.  Dont use Giant to tank Mini P though not a good trade.  Skels are meant for that.  I also use Giant to tank Wizards and most AoE type troops.  High single target DPS types should be dealt with using swarm or Cannon.If you watch my replays I almost never use Mini P to defend unless theyre units that cant fight back.  When they can I try to allow Mini P to only take one hit.  Keeping the units alive and using tower damage to trade for healthy units is what makes the unstoppable pushes.The decks power comes from the positive trades youll do during the course of the game.  Also allowing your units like Musket to march to their death or cause them to drop a defender like their own Musket is the best situation.  A naked Musket not tended to can do massive damage so you dont have to form a push around her.  Unless you know they have cheap units like Skels then you can drop your own Skels to counter.Their Musket might have saved tower damage but they will die to a Skel drop giving us a  elixir advantage on the other end.  Not to mention a faster cycle since our Musket will come back before theirs.The video below is one example and Ill try to upload the other game as well but theyre once again not the highest of quality matches.,ClashRoyale,d6gt6ac,1,t5_3bog8

This is how I do itOn  situations and helpful if I have a collector down already   I play the gobs on the side without tower but way back by my towers.  By the time the gobs reach the bridge but before where they get targeted by the enemys king towers I play the Giantballoon in that midfield.  This allows an attack on both the remaining tower as well as gobs picking off the king tower.  Its hard to stop both of those.  Skels are too slow for this.  So what does your current deck look like?,ClashRoyale,d6n1u9b,1,t5_3bog8

You have to build mines other buildings and technology to get resources and knowledge to be able to colonize more planets or to build planetary defenses and spaceships.The main goal of the game is to feel like you own your own empire and you can control it as you want. For example you can be apex and attack to everyone else of course it isnt as easy as it sounds you have to do a lot of calculations to be able to maintain your empire in a good shape. Or you can form Alliance and unite a lot of other empires and with their help take down the biggest empire in the universe to take its place. etc. Its up to player.My redesigned server is built by enthusiast project is called moons and its open source.Mine version is upgraded in many waysSkin is fully redesigned It has many modifications such as premium bonuses harvest mod academy black market experience bars achievements premium shop a new admin panel and a lot of small improvements.

Send hog and mindlessly zap.Now hog cycle veterans are going to have to think about efficient trades and elixer cycle  something that doesnt exist in hog cycle strategies at the moment.

I predicted earlier that giant poison will be nerfed indirectly and thats what happened . I do think its a good decision . That giant poison deck becomes meta only after arena  when people can have the pump  poison and guards which makes a strong combination . Giant is something that is played by everyone from training camps to legendaries and there is no reason to debuff the giant right now . However I did think a second or two off poison would have been good . It was done with the freeze and so poison should have been nerfed as it is really strong and offers great utility . Also people would make a choice between both freeze and poison . Also if people are playing more bowlers and lumberjacks it gives them good defence against giant decks .

You cant zap her because she survives it you cant rely on your towers to finish her off and if you just sent fire spirits are her she would kill them with ease. That plus  of my opponents having her because she was so OP I would have to sub in arrows fireball or poison. Or just wait until she lock on to something send fire spirits after her have those get zapped so zap her and send ice spirit at the same time at her just to have skeletons dropped to absorb the hit so then I have to use a  elixir Musk on the opposite side that I am rushing just to take out that damn princess.

8739476,0,t3_4zq7bi,Congrats on the legendaries!Heres the core of my current Sparky deck and method in building itYou want to protect Sparky with a tank and the best are PEKKA Giant Royal Giant and Golem.My personal favorite is Giant but I have used RG in the past. Giant is cheaper than RG and has extra health which means you can protect Sparky longer.So lets start a deck. Win Condition Giant Win Condition  Sparky Win Condition Support Fire Spirits  PrincessFire spirits will support Sparky by clearing out cheap units your opponent tries to surround Sparky with. Minion Horde for example is completely wiped out by fire spirits. However these guys can be zapped so wait until your opponent either zaps Sparky or drops cheap troops to deploy the fire spirits. If you have Princess she fits well in this slot. You could put Wizard in this slot but Fire Spirits do as good of a job for  lower elixir making your deck more efficient.Because of how expensive Sparky pushes are youll want to be efficient on defense. In addition to this you can get bad trades using Sparky so youll want to be able to hold off big pushes and recover.My favorite defensive card is Mini Pekka because she chews through tanks pretty fast. You could substitute in barbs if you prefer but Id suggest Mini Pekka. Lumberjack also fits great in this slot since he can defend well then set up an epic counter push which is the core mechanic of Sparky decks.My second card for defense is Ice Wizard. Furnace is a great option because of the extra fire spirits it pops out. Main Defense Mini Pekka  Lumberjack Defensive Support Ice Wizard  Cannon  FurnaceBecause of how expensive Sparky pushes are youll definitely want an elixir collector to finance your pushes. It will also help you recover from bad trades. Elixir CollectorAfter all these cards youre left with  slots a spell and a troop. You could pick a melee support troop gobs spear gobs minions archers guards etc if youd like. Ive gone back and forth with different cards in this slot. Ive tried Goblin Barrel great for zap bait and high DPS Miner good against Princesses and Ice Spirit my favoritegreat on both offense and defense. Most recently Ive been running Minions for stronger antiair.You could also go with  spells if youd like such as fireball as my deck is weak to  musketeers. For spell I like Zap the best but you can really pick any of them.So heres the deck weve built Win Condition Giant Win Condition  Sparky Win Condition Support Fire Spirits  Princess Main Defense Mini Pekka  Barbs  Lumberjack Defensive Support Elixir Collector The Runner Cannon  Ice Wizard  Furnace for more fire spirits Versatile Response Card Minions  Ice Spirit  Goblin Barrel  Miner Spell ZapIf you are interested in reading some of the Sparky guides I have written you can see them here here and here ,ClashRoyale,d6y32ao,1,t5_3bog8

8746148,0,t3_4zuuqp,DP is not that heavy sooo... in the mechanics standpoint he is heavy because hes not knocked back by anything. I think he still needs more HP simply because his health is not worth against the Valkyrie yet. Valkyrie has better usage due to her better defensive power against many backlines sporting better DPS and the ablility to hit . Even though he has speed and better offensively I still find myself picking Valk over him. PEKKA is my favorite card. Never stopped playing her ever since I got her in A when I was still climbing to Legendary. Shes easy to defend against since a lot of cards can easily counter her for a positive elixir trade. To effectively use her your other win condition should have high DPS that can shred through most troops be it the Double Prince or the  Musketeers. I also see merit in running her beside Lumberjack a newly buffed card. For her recent damage buff I think she did not need it. It did not change any interaction with other troops except Ice Wiz and Witch good luck reaching them with a lone PEKKA. What she needed is more HP at least making her have  hp at lvl. If SC doesnt realize that theyre buffing her the wrong way might as well go all the way make PEKKA DEAL INFINITE DAMAGE jkGolem is another card that I can play since hes my second lvl epic. Unlike PEKKA Golem is harder to play atm imo since its easy to punish a Golem play at the back now. Unlike PEKKA which can defend agains a building targetter push Golem has a problem with that needing damage support to defend agains those kinds of pushes. I really feel Golem is a great card but I still cant use him properly. ,ClashRoyale,d6yx7qk,21,t5_3bog8

If they dont have a defensive building it usually gets you at least  shot. So you dont need to be counterpushing all too much.

But since losing is punishing me I cant afford to lose continously only to have fun.All Levels s or s in Legendary Arena had overleveled cards for their level.Legendaries are OP. Compare Lumberjack to Mini Pekka. Lumberjack has  less DPS than a minipekka but also drops a rage spell. He even attacks faster and got the highest possible movement speed in the game. Hes a better choice than a minipekka in anyway you take it defensively or offensively.Legendaries are a boost. Legendaries got special abilities no other card has. Ice Wizard is one of the best defensive cards in the game. Giving it based on luck is stupid. Also getting to Legendary Arena means either being way more skilled than the enemy or have better cards in terms of level and choice  mini pekka  lumberjackLegendaries  A better variety and theyre not like Skeleton Army theyre really usefull that can be a core cards to many decks.Even Chief Pat one of the best maxed players stated that Legendaries are a boost.Believe me Lvl  fireball against level  Musketeer makes the difference. A  HP Musketeer can deal thousands of damage if she got a tank in front of her. The difference between Lvl  Goblins and Lvl  goblins for a king level  is  crown tower shots to kill goblins and . That means you would have to respond with a card for the lvl  goblins because the lvl  would not deal that much damage.In my case using Trifecta makes the difference. A lvl  Hog would get at least  more shot on the tower in the same case that a lvl  hog wouldnt.  damage on the tower matters. Because a lvl  hog got more damage and gets more shotsHow am I ignorant?

To play sparky properly you need to overwhelm your opponent with a huge elixir advantage.Personally I think the deck needs a bit more splash but thats just my opinion I hope umwolverine doesnt mind  Having just spirits and zap wont be enough without princess. It is also cheap which is good but it lacks defense a sparky deck is supposed to take damage but you cant use it properly if your towers are quickly getting destroyed. Maybe try minions for FS,ClashRoyale,d7q47w7,2,t5_3bog8

8971031,0,t3_532t3i,Your explanation of why Bowler is good against Giant in Inferno control decks is precisely why Ive switched from the traditional Mini Pekka Miner Inferno control tower to the modern Bowler version with Guards. Slow troop movespeed is actually the best thing for defensive troops. Im hoping Supercell picks up on this and maybe can slow down the movespeed of the Baby Dragon.. that thing always ends up on the wrong side of the map without you having enough time to support it afterwards for a counterpush.

9021223,0,t3_53u1fj, When making idea threads keep it simple. Not many people care about your love for goblins and some toxics could even stop after they read that line and downvote you with no reason. Seems a bit too similar to a MiniPekka but with fast attack rate. I think that anyway having a Ogre card which isa goblin tank would be awesome. A poison mortar seems nice but to go along with the goblin theme a Goblin Catapult would be awesome. Either it throws single golbins at pretty fast rate or it throws barrels at very slow rate. I dont think that selective buffing mechanics work in this game. First it reduces variety because basically those  cards would fit only in golbinbased decks. Second it gets overly complicated for nothing.,ClashRoyale,d7w7k6q,3,t5_3bog8

One way is to place the Giant in the back and lure their AOE cards so by the time the Giant is about to reach their side you surround it with Skeleton Army another is to do the same thing but instead place another giant along with backup such as mini Pekka or archers one giant usually dies but the rest live on to destroy the tower. The other one is to time the mini Pekka and archers behind the Giant just right and itll usually go for the inferno tower and destroy it before the Giant gets too much damage.,ClashRoyale,d7wt9hj,5,t5_3bog8

9118812,0,t3_555ck3,I agree that giant is currently OP but more of the problem lies between the fact that it is too good at building a push and the support troops. In double elixir time even without the use of pump it can easily build up a huge push consisting of giant musket and mini P. The combo isnt that hard to stop but poison makes it so your troops cant kill the combo in time before they kill yours. If you cannot completely clean up the support troops the real struggle begins. With the elixir they saved up they can put down a second giant on the same lane shielding the support troops left over and you wont have enough elixir to defend against it. If youre able to stop that one push your troops wont be healthy enough to form a nice counter push and they do the push all over again.In my opinion the giant isnt the only problem. A solution would be nerfing the entire deck especially the win conditions and if the deck is still too strong buff the counters to giant that doesnt fit in a giant push deck.,ClashRoyale,d87xlwy,0,t5_3bog8

Honestly even the ways to counter it are  completely different. But since you guys just want to say its the same why I even bother it. ,ClashRoyale,d887jqi,1,t5_3bog8

9213610,0,t3_56jqqg,A shield spell sounds interesting  but maybe you can give it a second function? So its not totally useless when the enemy doesnt have spells?  Maybe like a push effect? It pushes enemy troops off the radius?That way it has offensive and defensive options. Also make it so it isnt locked onto a troop  that would make it less op on troops like hogs and goblin barrels and minions. Also itll add a bit of skill to use it. It should have a fireball radius to be capable of blocking powerful spells like rocket and fireball but offer limited defensive ability from spells like lightning arrows and poison. Cast time should be as fast as zap. . second invisibility on cast so you can get more successful zap baits. But the knock back effect happens on the first frames of casting the spell so if you cast the spell near pushable troops your opponent can tell youve casted it before its revealed.Duration should be . seconds to offer protection from poison. And have enough time for pre predict zap or arrowsmaybe some fire balls. But not for a pre predict rocket.It should cost  elixir so you can get trades on the heavy hitting spell rocket.  And a somewhat good trade on lightning. But  trades on fireball And poison. Terrible trade on arrows and a bad trade on zap too. ,ClashRoyale,d8jw6bp,1,t5_3bog8

Build a deck that you can feel something that follows your rhythm. I know it sounds cheesy af but honestly its worked for everyone in my clan. If you dont know how to start pick your absolute favorite card even If you dont use it in your current deck a card that you just like one that you severely want to play.

The deck works fairly well against most decks but its very aggressive so you constantly have to put pressure in each lane if you let them set up large pushes then they will counter the inferno tower the main defensive unit and thatll leave you pretty defenseless. The biggest issue i have in this deck is the starting hand if you start without minerlumberjack you lose your main push units which has you playing catch up the entire game.

9288327,0,t3_57mw5f,Inferno dragon works very well in my lava hound deck replaced my minipekka. I find him well balanced there. I only use lava hound as my tank never giant or golem both underleveled. I can consistently defeat giant poison on challenges and on the ladder the dragon is VERY strong vs. giants and other tanks and a significant tower threat of not challenged.  My main weakness now is fast cycle decks as inferno dragon is terrible vs floods of cheap troops  I am now also weaker to hut decks. These funnily enough are the only decks that log shines against...Like many cards inferno dragon fits a niche role and is not a broadly useful card.  It has allowed me and other lava hound users to consistently counter giantpoison decks.

Family members are no different  if they are not an authorized user and the user did not authorize the specific transaction they are using the card fraudulently.  Every single transaction has to be authorized by the cardholder not just the first.  Nonfacing transactions is a risky business and costs banks and merchants a lot of money due to federal regulations regarding deposit and revolving credit accounts.  Merchants accept nonfacing payments with a reasonable assurance youre the authorized user usually through the use of zip code cardholder name or CVV but they are still accepting theres a risk that the transaction is unauthorized.  Merchants are prepared to credit back fraudulent charges but they arent going to do it without a fight.  Thats why I recommend just going to the party who has very explicit laws around consumer protection.  Skip the historically combatant merchant and go straight to the consumer advocates.  The bank will get their money back from the merchant.,ClashRoyale,d9pvddj,6,t5_3bog8

You never really played your golem or hound inside your opponents base even if you had some troops going down the lane. Do you believe that doing this is usually bad? Or did you just not find a proper opportunity?Do you plan on ever doing a guide on how to play golem? Im decent with it but want to get better and I think that most of the community would be extremely grateful if you made a guide. Not trying to pressure you just wondering.How much did you practice for the event? And were you extremely nervous?

9581380,0,t3_5c4x6p,I suspect the key reason they dont do this is that the distinguishing feature of epics is their scarcity and a feature like this would encourage people to pad their clans with epic farming alts who just open easy chests and donate the epics.

9581530,0,t1_d9u0zuh,The problem is that theres been so many new cards and newer cards coming out still yet we still receive the same old amount  which overall gives us worse odds of getting something worthwhile.Decreasing the timer means you can pick up the magiclegendary chest quicker so Im opposed to that but receiving an extra troop card in there would be helpful. Especially to those that want to get into legendary arena or are already there. Its a very hard grind to upgrade your cards when youre receiving a whole bunch of tesla towers and mortars.Even receiving a bit more gold would be helpful when it comes to upgrading your decks.,ClashRoyale,d9u4azx,2,t5_3bog8

9589343,0,t1_d9uyf0g,The thing about the current tank meta is that its more reliant on the supporting cards rather than the main tank. I think any of the tanks could beat the other tank decks. If youre running Golem  double Minions youre probably going to beat Lava Hound. If youre running Lava Hound  Inferno Dragon youre probably going to beat Golem. Lava Hound  Minions generally beat Giant Bowler and Giant Barbs can beat Golem decks. The supporting cards are a huge factor in these tank matchups rather than the actual tanks themselves. ,ClashRoyale,d9v2z5b,5,t5_3bog8

9592260,0,t3_5cc7os,The game has level progression so it essentially has elements of RPG games. You WILL get stuck in a place until you progress enough to push through that. Stop bitching about overleveled cards when you play with player thatve been playing for much longer than you in these type of game. Some people dont tryhard they just play for fun with decks that they like. Not all deck can be play with low level cards only highly defensive decks can be play against higher level cards. Try playing underleveled  musketeers.Supercell already dealt with the problem of progressing in lower arena sub  trophies count by giving you more trophy when you win and less when you lose.If supercell do something that matched you only with players with card levels on par with you therell be no incentive to progress.

9596804,0,t3_5cejft,Just made it to Arena  myself using a really aggresive miner chip deck which seemed to be able to compete with almost any deck  I won  out of my last  games lost  drew Miner Furnace Guards Ice Spirit Skarmy Mega Minion Log Zap. The ideal starting hand is to have miner plus furnace or miner plus guards and ice spirit although the ice spirit is optional. Normally most players will wait to fill up to  elixir before they play anything as they want to create a strong push with their GolemsLava HoudnsGiantsetc. Some even wait for you to play something first. This deck doesnt wait around for that shit. As soon as you hit  mana its time to GO! Deploy your furnace  or  tiles in front of your crown tower and then instantly deploy your miner on the same side behind or to the side of their tower. by the time the miner gets there the first  fire spirits from the furnace will already be crossing the river. you gotta be fast or the first fire spirit will aggro the tower before the miner gets out and you will lose some damage.  Most of the time people will be taken by surprise by this aggresive start and you will get off a decent amount of damage fire spirits do a deceptively high amount of damage. If you start with miner and guards do the same thing but deploy the miner first then instantly the guards on the bridge of the same side. If you have an ice spirit throw that in with the guards. The opponent will once again be taken by surprise most of the time and try to deal with the miner in panic by deploying a pekka muskateer etc. The guards will get to the tower and will do quite a bit of damage if left alone especially if the ice spirit gets there. If they try to deal with the guards instead your miner will do decent damage instead.  Skarmy and MM are used defensively most of the time but are flexible and can be used on offense as well.  The aim is to keep the aggression and pressure up all the time. Defend when you have to but as soon as you hit  elixir and dont have to defend. its time to GO! Dont let your opponent play their game make them have to constantly react. They will defend against you each time but their tower will slowly wittle down. If they are building a cunter push with a lot of ground troops the log will weaken them while also contiuing to chip their tower. If they deploy minions or minion horde to deal with your miner try to insta zap them to let him get in an extra hit while also damaging the tower and in most cases dealing with the minions as a fire spirit from your furnace will probably finish them off as they come down towards your side.  If your furnace is level  and your opponent is the same level as you they will constantly have to deal with the spirits as leaving them alone will mean one of them will always hit the tower. you will often get a chance to double up on furnaces and start to snowball out of control. The furnace is awesome in this regard because even if it doesnt get to the tower it then acts as a defense against whatever is coming your way.  Once your opponent tower is on like  health leave it alone and start pressuring the other side. You can easily kill it later with one miner hit a log and a zap so its better to not activate his king tower yet.  Im rambling now but try it out and have fun. Give it some time as it takes some getting used to but this is one of the decks I never get bored of since its so aggresive and fun to play. ,ClashRoyale,d9w0371,2,t5_3bog8

9638823,0,t1_da11gty,Hey yeah Im still running it just made a couple of tweaks. Instead of fire spirits Ive got fireball now since I felt the deck lacked some direct damage that comes in handy late game and mega minion instead of musk to keep the deck at ..RG is tough. Ill probably go  against a good one. Youve just got to be ready for their counter to your IT as its your most effective tool against RG. Play your musk same for MM or minions behind IT to remove any distractions and hopefully they move onto the RG to help take him out. If you know zap is in their rotation try a miner barrel push to try and bait out their zap so you can use Skarmy to defend. Barrel alone is fine but sometimes theyll just take the damage if they catch on to what youre doing so adding miner will force them to respond.Havent faced too many XBows lately but that deck just seems annoying to deal with. Heres a deck where fireball comes in handy especially if they clump their troopstower next to the XBow. Id throw out minions if they have tower up and mega minion the bow. Dont be afraid to miner the bow if you have to too but dont overextend your defense with him. Push the other lane of you can and force him to defend so you can Skarmy the bow but with log and zap its tough. This is just how Id theoretically approach the matchup. That deck has a lot of counters so Im not sure how well it would go but probably not very well. I definitely need more games against the XBow.

9730708,0,t3_5ehy8g,I hate level cap for arena. It makes bad players to be stuck at lower arenas and promoves fp and limits pw this is not bad actually but it is against the good sense of a company.   But level cap per King tower is not bad actually.     It makes harder to overlevel some cards since you need to upgrade all your cards  or at least a couple of them to raise your king level. I actually liked pretty much the idea.I only think that the limit should always be above tournament standart. And the limit should not exist at very low levels  maybe start only at level  for example.,ClashRoyale,dacit4o,1,t5_3bog8

9737635,0,t3_5elkkj,Ive used a deck similar to this to finally make the climb out from arena  into the Legendary Arena recently so Id definitely say Im familiar with Hog Cycles let me know if you have any questions!But to start with some of the really important and key cards for hog cycle are found in arena  such as Ice Spirit and Ice Golem so it may be a little less effective but a decent hog cycle deck could beHog Self explanatory why this card is used just remember to try and look for the important openings in your opponents defense to play it so you get the most value out of it.Archers Really versatile card currently great for defense getting a little chip damage or baiting  theres currently a great guide on the front page right hereTombstone Really meta card currently great for being annoyingdistracting other cards notably the Mega Minion plus if left unattended while your tankother cards are being hit it can allow for some sweet chip damage.Zap Another very versatile card great for pretty obvious reasons. No real tips here.Fireball Great card to get value out of. Always nice to get a good doubletriple hit fireball off on the opponents tower and troops so use that when you see an opportunity. Additionally if theres a huge clumped up swarm coming your way it can be great for defense but again Id only use this if you see a good opportunity. Mega Minion Probably one of the best cards in the game right now so this is a musthave in my opinion. Known for its versatility great on defense and a heavy hitter on offense. Whenever Im running a deck similar to this Ill usually end up playing my Mega Minion on defense and then that will translate into a counterpush with my Hog.Valk This is the card that Im a little iffy about. Typically youd want a cheap tank here best is Ice Golem but since you dont have arena  cards yet you may need to settle for Valk. Though thats not to say Valk is bad  its another extremely versatile card stellar on crowd control either offensively or defensively. When pushing a tower youd likely want to hit with a Valk in front being pushed by a Hog Though note Im not  certain on the Valk so you may find better luck with using a cheap troop like Goblins just to tank for your Hog to get to the tower.Fire Spirits This is another card Im not certain on since Id typically use Ice Spirit here but I think Fire Spirits could suffice. They can be used to buy some time on defense distract other troops great against Mega Minion and if paired up behind a push they can be good for getting some more chip damage. Hope this guide helped and please feel free to ask me any question if you have any thanks!EDIT usashshash pointed out Knight which hadnt crossed my mind  if youre looking for a cheaper and overall fasterpaced deck Knight shouldcan be swapped out for Valk mainly because its cheaper. ,ClashRoyale,daddjs6,2,t5_3bog8

9788976,0,t1_daibsw4,I havent used this deck in quite a while so no replaysvideos So I made sure to only play Sparky into an opposing enemy unit. Sparky is easily punished if you drop it into an empty lane. You can still use it as a tank for barrel though if you choose to use barrel instead of gobs if it survives after defending.After defending a push where my opponent used zap one thing I liked to do with this deck was push on both lanes. Say you have a Sparky coming down the lane on a counter push and you know your opponent doesnt have a zap. You can pull off shenanigans like send a miner at the tower Sparky is going towards but have it tank for both towers i.e. place it on the inside tile. Then send gobs down the other lane. Makes it tough on opponents to defend.Skarmy level isnt THAT important. Only interactions that change with levels are against other skeletons and Ice Wizard.,ClashRoyale,dajpcy7,2,t5_3bog8

9803372,0,t3_5fmrpu,Hello im Zisme hovering at  JYVJYLVNot my main deck but i play it occasionallyI would suggest a miner hog goblins minion zap ice spirit inferno tower baby dragonThere is always a push availablehog anything minions  miner gob  miner ect. and thus the key is when they put down a tank or supporting unitlooks like a heavy push immediately push the other lane. That forces a counter and generally chips while the lone unit is defended with inferno tower. For example the put a giantgolemgiant dootsparky lavahound in the back right. You pop a goblin barrel and miner then clean up the tank with the inferno for a positive trade. If they ignore your push it can take a tower. It destroys pump. Its pretty bad against spawnersbut that might just be my play style. Ive won against air heavy decks but it is a little more challenging Definitely a fun deck as it leaves your opponent extremely frustratedseveral disconnects. PM if you do not like it and i have a couple more in my back pocket but have to study and do not want to type it out. All the cards can be swapped too except for hog  miner so you can stay hog steady. Bonus tip ice spirt plus zap kills minion horde and lavahound pups,ClashRoyale,dalh619,1,t5_3bog8
9804136,0,t1_dakhvpb, Muskies I have to use Princess a lot archers and Mega Minion. I pushed up to . Golem Lightning I can beat I just need to prepare for lightning and not use Mega Minion early. So I would do something like Inferno  Archers they lightning and I use a combination of princess mega minion and zap to beat it. Then I Hog  Ice Spirit combined with prediction log for tombstone.  Also I do so much hog cycling and get off so much damage that they usually dont have enough elixir for their ideal push so  a lot of the time they cant lightning in time making it pretty easy to defend.,ClashRoyale,dalkk06,1,t5_3bog8

Granted the ice golem does a fine job itself the ice spirits ability to cycle and put it in the back before putting the Xbow down is why I preferred it. I tried both skarmy and guards and I find that I mainly use guards to counter infernos and midtanks without having to worry about being zapped or logged.

9840203,0,t3_5g0t5z,Thanks for all the feedback especially the constructive criticism! The reason I made it legendary is that the Royale team said they were working on a legendary building and we dont have any building that can easily handle Minion Horde and Lava Pups. Plus the Wizard Tower is one of the best defenses in Clash of Clans taking out hordes of Hogs Giants Valkyries and Balloons as well as all the usual suspects. To me the wizard tower just FEELS legendary.    I love uphliuys idea to have the Wizard drop from the heavens and raise the Mountain out of the ground then hops on top. I made the Deploy time  seconds to account for the animation.    A lot of users said the damage may be too high so I reduced the DPS but slightly slowed the hitspeed keeping the Area Damage the same. This way it still shots level  minions just like its tournament standard counterpart.    Pretty much everybody agreed that its cost is too low. Made it  elixir in line with the Wizard and Bomb Tower.     People also talking about the range. I made it . to BM the RG. My own frustration and lack of skill got in the way of making a logical and balanced card. The Wizard tower range in Clash of Clans is relatively small. Range reduced to  tiles in line with the Wizard.    Also in line with other splash cards I wrote Area Damage in the damage area. That was a detail I did not catch.

When I first made this deck I hadnt tried the Mega Minion after the nerf because I thought the nerf made it bad it didnt affect too much. Also I think minions work well in this deck because of their speed and ability to do well with Hog unlike Mega Minion. Idk pick whatever you like. There is not really any particular reason to use minions instead of Mega Minion except the speed. Im sure you can even create a better deck than I have created. Thats just a deck I made out of my head and did well with it so never changed anything.,ClashRoyale,datgq5z,2,t5_3bog8

We all know the infamous metas from Xbow hogfreeze Goison etc. Those cardsdecks were meta because they were dominant and were used profusely. You would see one of these decks every game. Once these decks became so common decks were created to counter them. Just look to Trifecta counter hogcycle and Pekka muskies counter goison. In todays clash we do not have one defined meta deck such as GiantPoison  whatever. We have minerrocket zap bait GiantBowlerLightning hog and the ever popular Gravybowl. Again can we have a meta if it is so diverse? ,ClashRoyale,daxiuoi,1,t5_3bog8

Find somebody around your skill level could be a friend or clanmate and challenge yourself to do better than them. Let them know make it a friendly competition. This can motivate you to work harder and harder to best your rival. Their trophy high is a little above you? Push yourself to beat them. They just got rd in a  player tournament? Practice so that you can get nd or st!You can easily outgrow your rival. If that happens find someone else to compete with. If you are consistently beating your rival in competitions dont be afraid to start competing with somebody else.

The only other route is to pay thousands of dollars to pay to win this game. Personally once I hit tourney cap play around a bit and try to get all of the legendaries the next goal is so far out of reach Ill be quitting shortly after.

Those  are your main push so you want to save the LJ in this situation. When placed optimally LJ tanks for the Lavapups while they all do damage with MM around too. When LJ dies he drops the rage and buffs all the Lavapups for that insane damage boost.Lumberjack actually became my favorite card with this deck his fast movement speed and attack speed are so satisfying when he shreds a tank support or tower. ,ClashRoyale,dbfv9ry,1,t5_3bog8

10044194,0,t1_dbg9dji,No problem! BTW thx for replying! So what I want to learn is how to build a strong wellbalanced mortar deck counters meta has good air defense etc.. I struggle against graveyard decks with my mortar deck. Seeing as you have a vey cheap avg. elixir cost You dont have many answers to graveyard besides archers and knight. Also how do you counter elite barbs with your deck? I dont know if people use them frequently up where youre at but down at  trophies I see them in  out of every five matches. Could you also name how to counter the most popular playsyles? For example to counter lava hound place down mortar and rush the other side. Use archers to defend aginst lava hound and if they have lightning..... you get the point. I know this is a lot of questions but you seem like a really nice guy. Dont fret if you cant answer all of my questions the main one I want answered is how to build a well balanced mortar deck. Thx!,ClashRoyale,dbgs8s4,1,t5_3bog8

Also the lack of IT in the meta might make Ice wizard a better choice because he is spell resistant can splash multiple units and is a bit better to swarms. Ewiz could synergize with lightning but I believe something like zap of fireball would be better because they deal AOE unlike the Ewiz except on spawn. ,ClashRoyale,dbmim3s,1,t5_3bog8

Ive roughly estimated the numbers for the shop probability. With very poor odds I should have had the log at least  times in the shop. Graveyard isnt as bad obviously with more legendarys now and less time since its release but if my rough numbers are right then statistically it should defiantly have been in the shop by now. If these were the only negative statistic anomolys in the game I might not really think much of it but I got so screwed on buying chests theres no way supercells numbers are correct.

10147756,0,t1_dbu4sud,No its top tier players fault and the matching system why they cant win! When you were in lets say builders workshop or royale arena could you beat the top person in your clan or would they woop you before even overtime started? Did you even stand a chance to beat this higher level player or did you lose because you didnt start clash royale around the same time he or she did to gain the experience to beat them. Also let me point out drop rates for legendaries in lower arenas is much lower then that of legendary arena and if your a lower arena player and if you try doing more then the normal challenge you are gonna lose about  of the time. So becuase of this they have minuscule chances to get even  legendary. And so is it really a crime to let people who are struggling to get legendaries have a chance or.

Also they DO lose money. Just because they can create how many gems they want doesnt mean they dont lose money.  gems equates to .AU and I believe .USD for an ingame purchase. This is money that people could be spending on the game but arent because Supercell handed it to them for free. You say youre sick of Supercell being seen in a bad way.

10242930,0,t3_5mof4l, Behold the mighty SHOCK BOMB! Its Deploy Time is its charge time. If its hit by a troop while its charging it will deal  area damage and will not stun.  Due to its long charge time it is not a good replacement for Zap because it is ineffective if used directly on a troop and only works on your side of the arena. After the  seconds if a troop walks on it it will deal  damage and will stun units for a full second making it a decent secondhand Fireball. After ten seconds of full charge it will explode automatically.  It does  of a Fireballs damage and less damage than a Log while not charged but more damage than Zap.  Good Example Barbarians are coming towards your tower. You use the Shock Bomb in front of your tower to damage the Barbarians when they get there and prevent your opponent from using anything else. Bad Example A Sparky is locked on to your tower. You use the Shock Bomb right on the Sparky but it explodes instantly and does not reset its charge.,ClashRoyale,dc53cxe,0,t5_3bog8

I already do this kind of things tho but most of the time the balloon reaches the inferno before it even kills the hound making this matchup kinda hard. But well youre right it is not impossible and maybe I shouldve written this part of the guide anyway. Concerning the double inferno it could work if I play the first one earlier Im used to play it late to avoid the life going down but I dont think it will save me against a good lavaloon player tho.Classic challenges are easy compared to grand ones if you win classic challenges and are fine with earning cards this way you should definitely keep going. If I take my ladder deck and replace the ice spirit by the ice golem it makes me do  wins every time Or almost because there are always exceptions but I dont remember bout grand challenges I think my max was  with it didnt play it a lot tho. Before the graveyard came out and before the overpopularity of the furnace in challenges my ladder deck was pretty good in challenges too  did a w with it when I was at the beginning of my learning with this deck.,ClashRoyale,dcbqz74,1,t5_3bog8

10350269,0,t1_dch4i9x,I feel there are issues with growing a clan and some clans want to remain smaller with people they know and trust. Why should larger clans have an advantage and why is Supercell concerned with encouraging larger clans. My clan tries to get new members but its fairly difficult in Royale and we all know the issue with hoppers. Were already experiencing people dropping loads of trophies to farm crowns and its becoming an issue that is deterring lower level players from the game.If the clan chest is less of a grind fest fewer people would be so concerned about maxing it out since it would be more manageable and would be less inclined to drop so far to farm crowns. Also why should a clan have an advantage just because they are larger? In Clash of Clans the main clan game play mode is Clan Wars. Wars are scaled by participating members. We dont have  vs.  wars because it would be out of balance. The clan chest follows similar mechanics as it makes sense for smaller clans to have a lower crown requirement while everybody who reaches their respective requirement gets the same reward. Royale is very much a single player progression design in a multilayer setting. Clans mostly give social interaction and a few perks such as donations and friendly battles. Shouldnt the clan chest experience be treated as such? Shouldnt it be scaled by participating members with an even contribution requirement per player? The end rewards assist in progression for the individual player with no bearing on clan progression.If at some point Supercell introduces clan levels to then upgrade the clan chest contents per season larger clans can have an advantage with more experience for leveling up the clan. The same design has already been put in place in Clash of Clans. Each war battle win grants experience for the clan. More bases or players more experience for the clan.  I dont believe however that larger clans should have an advantage to obtaining a maxed level clan chest simply because they have more players. The way it is designed now has already been proven to cause issues and one of the problems I think is simply the amount of grinding required by smaller clans.,ClashRoyale,dch9ha9,1,t5_3bog8

10354066,0,t3_5o91ui,Guys Pompeyo didnt wintrade. Heres what happened and why. Nova players have agreed to either play a match normally against each other or agree to draw to act as if the game never occured. Trainer Nova wanted to draw as he knew Pompeyo was playing Siege an archetype his deck doesnt do well against so he zapped the king tower. Pompeyo did not want to draw. They agreed to play normally which is why play starts so suddenly. Pompeyo did have the advantage because of Trainers dumbass move to zap the king. IMO Pompeyo would have won regardless considering he is simply better AND its a bad matchup for Trainer Nova. TLDR Trainer Nova tried to force Pompeyo to draw Pompeyo wanted to play.

If my opponent drops bowler behind the arena tower and fire spirits from my furnace are timed properly the second one will hit both the bowler and the tower.

It would also allow streamers and event organizers more creative ways to run events.

His unopposed GY was what actually did damage to the Tower but only because OP had to make a choice on which threat to defend.

The guide is for finding replacements playing an equal role.Any reader of this guide will understand its for general purposes. Noone will take the guide that serious that heshe replaces all hisher cards with a recommended replacement.

10472768,0,t1_dcv6h1u,In conjunction with my other comment Id like to add the purpose of clash royale is to be a game with a balanced meta that promotes good skill and strategy. The leveling up of furnace is irrelevant because the purpose of the game is not to promote leveling up a single card. That is a side effect of unchecked OP cards. Examples Overleveled ebarbs found in ladder overleveled RGs found in ladder. It is not supercells fault some people have decided to include an overleveled furnace in their decks that is personal choice and with personal choices come personal consequences. ,ClashRoyale,dcv72pg,2,t5_3bog8

10490929,0,t1_dcsq8xz,Always thought itd be interesting if you could have the king jump off of his tower and join the battle. But in actual regard to the idea. It could have seriously weird deck implications. A one use hero would reduce your deck size to  allowing abnormally fast cycling after its usage.A timed use hero could create balancing issues.How does one incentivize the use of a card costing elixir and waiting whilst not making it overpowered? This problem is already shared with the Big Pekka and it has no timer attached to its use just its deployment. The card is simply too slow to fit into a lot of current metas and is countered too easily by cards with solid DPS like archers who will kite and kill the Pekka. And a card which costs around  elixir may work but just as the three musketeers could do great against certain deck archetypes and terrible against specific cards in the game. The Muskies work well against air decks and beat down but are hard countered by lightning fireball and rocket. ,ClashRoyale,dcx99ne,1,t5_3bog8

10499826,0,t3_5q9pgu,This would be great for breaking up the monotony of the chest cycle. It might be simpler to just add some diversity to what you can currently get from silver chests instead. For example maybe  in  silver chests could replace the cards with a prize like a free classic challenge ticket a pouch of gold with x the normal silver chest gold or a guaranteed epic. And the chance of getting these could go up slightly as you increase arenas. Part of what makes the chests interesting is that you dont know what cards youll get so I think this could work better than adding different types of predictable chests to the cycle.,ClashRoyale,dcy9l9q,5,t5_3bog8

10521393,0,t3_5qnv9e,The mortar is the best I think. It has great hitpoints which means it can take a ton of shots from a tank. The deadzone is its shining defensive feature though. Once the tank is within it it starts dropping bombs on the support troops. Its range also renders the princess chip strategy useless. Im running an xMortar deck at  and while I use my xbow as the primary win condition Id be just as fine using the mortar on offense if the cycle calls for it. ,ClashRoyale,dd0pp5c,2,t5_3bog8

10572628,0,t3_5rddb1, pretty solid mortar deck buuuuut. Why ice golem? Unless you desperately need to kite units back toward their own tower I highly recommend replacing with knight or even mini pekka.Minions are amazing but for defending your building they have to hover above it making great spell bait. Archers by contrast can defend from range. Depends how often you get fireballed I guess. I have no comment on executioner as I havent played him but level  is low so you want to really make sure youve got a good reason for him to be there. Looks like a fun deck but seriously if you have a knight try him out. ,ClashRoyale,dd6hfh2,2,t5_3bog8

10654908,0,t3_5sgjga,Its hard to judge whether the zap nerf he does alone will be enough of a nerf that he no longer acts like an electro wiz  Valkyrie. One thing thats troubling is that having a card blatantly erasing another card from the game and making that op card more harder to get makes me fear of other old cards that work just fine but get forgotten cause the newer ones are so much better. Particularly if you have been using a working deck that you know how to play well and spent all your resources on it but than get shut down on just  new released card and than you get that card and than it gets hard nerfed and you go back to your old card but could have made it even stronger. It starts to become a cycle of useless grinding to get the best cards for afterwards nothing.,ClashRoyale,ddeyzw0,7,t5_3bog8

They know what they are doing but sometimes when there is a deadline testing is usually the first part to be skipped.Even there is time for enough testing it is hard to tell if a card is OP or not just by Supercell own testing. There are HUGE combinations of decks. It might be OP in some decks but not others. So the best way to test if it is OP is to roll it out ASAP and to collect the win rate data.,ClashRoyale,ddf6r5t,2,t5_3bog8

10690852,0,t3_5sxkiu,They said that the next update would be to add endgame content so I hope that could spark interest into the game again because a majority of the reason I am losing interest is because at endgame you just ladder against people who have higher cards than you for no reason other than to get the new card.The meta could be helped if all  styles of play be come balanced. That way if a card of a certain playstyle becomes powerful the counter playstyle will stop it. The only problem with this is that new cards always throw off the balance of the game by even a little bit.Also new cards shouldnt come as frequent. They change the meta of the game a little and most seem too similar to other cards. Some just fill niches in decks. IMO only cards like Tornado Fire Spirits and Miner should be added.

10695249,0,t1_dditgj7,So because it happens all across the board in a type of snowball effect its fine? Whats the point of earning trophies if you know youre going to either get them deflated or inflated at the end of the day? Why waste all that time and hard work on trying to get to new heights if youre just going to have around the same trophy count anyways? Again no one wants to face a dropper regardless of how many free wins theyve gotten because its a waste of there time and a potential waste of trophies. Ive played about  droppers so far all of them gave me a win but I would rather have earned it instead of being fed trophies Again why waste your time if your trophy count will pretty much be the same on average? Its much harder to gain crowns in higher arenas without dropping and some people dont play ladder for various reasons. Why should they be forced to? If they are donating a lot and are active otherwise why kick them?The real problem is that theres not enough ways to earn crowns. We need challenges to count for crown contribution. People are also too entitled to a level  clan chest. Maybe if the clan chest in general were reworked to where contributing is much easier donations instead of crowns or both there wouldnt be much of a problem anymore.,ClashRoyale,ddj4vvd,1,t5_3bog8

10768526,0,t1_ddqoovk,This was basically the meta build of spell bait about a month ago. The bowler is more for defense and is then used to tank barrels or even furnace spritesminion hordes on the counter push. The build lost in popularity because its soft to executioner though the version with bowler rather than spear gobsprincess does better. Now that executioner got nerfed it might go down in popularity which is beneficial to this deck.  Mirror is very versatile in this deck and I wouldnt switch it out without changing the whole thing. It makes defending with skarmy a lot more reliable because even if they zap or log you can drop another skarmy which will typically result in positive trades because you kill a  elixir troop bait zap then force them to play something to defend the incoming skarmy all for  elixir. It also lets you double log against other spell bait decks double barrel double furnace if the other deck is soft to furnace etc. Finally Fireball Mirror Fireball Log will close a lot of overtime games.,ClashRoyale,ddqozex,1,t5_3bog8

For  more elixir its an obvious choice to use executioner over musketeer.To save  elixir a  DPS increase and . tile range no aoe? AOE alone is worth the extra elixir more health and x damage is just icing on the cake making the musketeer just obsolete.Musketeer and Wizard had pros and cons and had their uses but with executioner now in the game has stolen both those roles albeit less range.

Those who say theyve never gotten ones and have been playing since March probably dont have much play time or say theyre in arena  at k when in reality theyve just reached level  in Arena .gt The Topic of The MetaAnyone who is involved with this is a dick both ways. Either you are a dick using a meta deck or you are being a dick because youre bragging about your off meta deck that youve used for  days until you started using the meta deck.gt  The Topic of the Subreddit First of all format error.Second of all there are some people on this sub who think they can make a difference. Instead of contributing a nice strategy post or anything else nice they just make this really really really long and unoriginal rant post about this sub that has basically the same topics that other ones had but just worded differently. Rant posts are becoming more unoriginal as the days pass being made by those who think they can save this sub.,ClashRoyale,ddsuwuj,2,t5_3bog8

10862379,0,t1_de0cu4y,Not the way I look at it. So many people use fireball and it provides too much value just for four elixirs. The amount of damage it does is pretty ridiculous if you opponent just defends and shoots repetitively at your troops near your tower. It takes out barbarians out too easily  musketeers too easily wizard ice wizard basically musketeer and so much more. It needs to be upped one elixir in my honest opinion because its a spell too much for its value.

10869415,0,t3_5vbrf9,Get used to it. Theyre here to stay. I personally have no issues with ebarbs because they are easily counterd by almost anything.Im not sure what you mean by your complaints of having to carry elite barb counters. Its the same with any win condition. You face a hog you need a building and some cheap units. You face a lavaloon and you need lots of air troops. You face a goblin barrel and youll need a log. Golem and inferno tower. The list goes on.Except with the ebarbs the different combinations of troops used to counter then are insane compared to other cards.News flash! If your constantly getting wrecked because your opponent zaps your defensive skarmy... stop using skarmy! Dont be so predictable.With proper elixir management and good plays elite barbs should not be an issue. Its likely youre making mistakes and your opponent is capatilizing on those mistakes. That doesnt make the card over powered.,ClashRoyale,de13pkw,0,t5_3bog8

11093256,0,t3_5yerv3,Ill give you a real answer instead of the retarded shit you asked for.At tourney standard poison fits better with a giantgraveyard push. It allows you to control a zone for  seconds and is best dropped after graveyard is activated when the opponent starts defending.On the ladder fireball is nearly always better. Poison does  more damage but you can request fireball meaning itll always outlevel the epic.

11151687,0,t1_dew0qvn,This placement will work with any building but it is not as effective with typical defensive buildings.This placement works because the royal giant locks onto the builiding but is still in range of the crown tower.  If you do this placement with a tesla cannon or inferno the royal giant will still be in range of the crown tower but it will be out of range of the defensive building which is not what you want.I only recommend this placement for spawners.  It works really well if you have a good barbarian hut deck.Unfortunately royal giant decks dont really have any very hard counters.  I think your best bet would be using a deck with inferno tower fire spirits and ice spirits.  Almost every single RG user tries to get around an inferno tower by placing minions behind the RG and zapping the inferno.  If you can use fire spirits to take out the minions quickly and freeze the royal giant with ice spirit so the inferno has time to heat back up you should be able to stop all of their pushes. Note that if an overleveled royal giant is locked onto an underleveled inferno tower a zap alone will let the royal giant take it out with plenty of health left. If you play the ice spirit the RG will die.,ClashRoyale,dew15f9,3,t5_3bog8

Thats questionable seeing as u really arent competing against the millions of people playing the game but only within a very small sub group.That said there are people in that top  who didnt actually have to spend that much money on the game.

I wouldnt call forcing fair matches screwing all players. Wanna play casually? Join the plentiful free tournaments or play a friendly battle. Its not ideal but if this is all they had to do to prevent the droppers if they even did anything at all aside from adding leagues is better than leaving it the old way. ,ClashRoyale,dezpnf9,2,t5_3bog8

11186500,0,t3_5zo9hq,The second arrow missed because it was aimed at the first fire spirit. You can see the tower princess reset her animation when she starts targeting the second fire spirit. You have to remember that tower arrows arent splash so they wont hit other troops other than the intended target. The fire spirits also become invincible once they start their attack animation which explains why it the arrow didnt hit when they were became invincible just before the arrow hit them which happens as a part of their attack  they gain invincibility when they start their attack animation.

11194185,0,t3_5zrokg,I think an important thing that you should consider is the marginal value of elixir how you value each consecutive elixir spent. When playing a card the value of card you receive in return for each elixir decreases because of the greater elixir deficit you put yourself at for playing the card. For example  knights would not be worth  elixir you would really only ever use such a card if it cost ish. That is because having  knights in the same place isnt really a whole lot more useful than having  and you suddenly are out of  elixir. In order to counteract this effect either the power of the cards must increase with elixir quantity or the cost must decrease with the quantity of cards as we see with  musketeers minion horde goblin gang skeleton army etc. So you should expect a  elixir card to outperform a pair of  elixir cards as a general concept obviously the many exceptions allow us to make positive trades. So I dont think that it is quite fair to say that ebarbs are overpowered based on the fact that they are a more than twice as good as  comparable cards. ,ClashRoyale,df0uiss,2,t5_3bog8

11225419,0,t3_606sss,In essence youre assuming all players carry zap. Your idea would basically throw out the buff they added to arrows and make it impossible to defeat sparky with zap according to your logic. Why is Sparky so powerful in lower arenas? Because all legendaries are instantly tournament standard getting a legendary early on in the game bolsters you so much! I can vouch I used lava hound all the way from builders workshop to hog mountain! The issue I faced with my lava hound before upgrading it recently was that it was taken down faster by level  towers but in lower arenas my lava hound by itself could and many times did take a tower after popping! Sparky presents similar issues for players in lower arenas as players with level  commons and level  rares level  or  epics will suddenly find themselves matched up against a deck with a tournament standard card. Increasing sparkys usability will simply guarantee a higher trophy count for those lucky enough to get her. ,ClashRoyale,df4dy2q,2,t5_3bog8

How many times has your log kept rolling and sweetened the pot?Its not so much that he did anything creative or alarming but that he was able to slice through all the counters so effectively.

Even under levelled each wave of barbs will still get off around  hits on tower. You also mentioned that playing hut makes you vulnerable as a  elixir investment all at once is risky. In most cases this isnt true as the opponent really cant punish a barb hut effectively the barb hut itself will stop attempts to punish while usually still surviving to either chip the tower or forced the opponent to waste elixir answering the remaining waves of the hut.

11266619,0,t1_dez8yq4,Hey! Ive been implementing your advice over the past week and wanted to update you.I originally tried the deck with the inferno tower instead of Mirror for a day or two but I suppose thats the last time Ill try a building because they just dont seem to fit in my play style. Something about using them is just not fun to me! After that I switched Inferno for the Rocket and had mixed results. Rocket is better than Inferno for sure and I really enjoyed shutting down ebarbsballoon so well. However its very slow and hard to control. Ive missed more times than Id like to admit and timing it with your troops for a predictionetc is tough.After a week of experience using the rocket Im definitely gonna keep it in my deck however now Im replacing Rage from the original deck and keeping Mirror. Ive already bumped up a hundred trophies reliably and I expect that to climb once I get used to timing the rocket. I think my main issue was getting hung up on replacing the wrong card I should have been looking at Rage the way I looked at mirror.Anyways Im hoping itll at least get me to the new legendary arena. Thanks for the great advice! Happy clashing ,ClashRoyale,df91zge,1,t5_3bog8

Arrows arent underpowered it does its job well but since there are other cards that are either cheaper and does its job almost as well  Zap or cards that are a bit more expensive but can do so much more Fireball there isnt really much reason to use Arrows unless the rest of your deck doesnt have a counter to Minions.Also Arrows doesnt have a niche while literally every other damage spell in the game does. Zap and Lightning stuns Fireball and Log knock back Poison lasts long and Rocket is just known for its crazy damage. Arrows has nothing and an addition like the owner post said An Executionlike stun will help give it the niche it needs.EDIT lmao the salt someone just downvoted everything favoring the Arrows buff in this post without even trying to argue back.,ClashRoyale,dfaek41,2,t5_3bog8

11353490,0,t1_dfi2qif,Getting chipped out isnt something you can stop. Princess will get at least one shot off you need to predict which side the Miner is going on to prevent all damage. Goblin barrel requires specific cards to counter without taking damage for a positive trade and The Log is the only commonly used card thats in that list which as a legendary cant be used by everyone. With all of those defensive cards many decks have no hope of reaching your tower. Some opponents are watching their tower slowly crumble while being completely unable to do anything about it and pushing on the other lane either gets shut down for a big positive trade or shut down easily for a reasonably even trade depending on how hard they push. Now its my fault that I use P.E.K.K.A. and Sparky and I know theyre bad so I can understand not being able to get them to the tower against some decks. Inferno and swarms together completely shut down my push so when that happens I try to draw while looking for a mistake to exploit. That opening doesnt exist with chip decks and I cannot possibly prevent all tower damage meaning my goal is to slow it down as much as I can and hope that I waste  minutes of my life.  minutes wasted should never be the ideal outcome.,ClashRoyale,dfiwayj,1,t5_3bog8

11387128,0,t3_62bdor,What are your plans for the next year of this amazing game? So far the game has had an awesome year and you guys are doing an amazing job releasing different unique cards making balance changes so the game is fun for everyone and adding new game modes like Clan Battles and the Draft Challenge. Do you have any more ideas that you plan to put in game in the future?Did the Clan Battles and Retro Royale meetexceed any expectations? I felt that it was awesome to play just like how it was back in the day with fewer cards and it made people make unique decks to help them get to  wins. Clan battles were super fun and could be continuously played without any trophy loss. The chaos of having so many card on one battlefield simply added to the fun and playing with a partner just made it more fun Everythings more fun with a friend!Hope to have another fantastic year playing this game ,ClashRoyale,dfmpmrn,1,t5_3bog8

11447171,0,t3_63eh55,I prefer doots to ice spirit as my  cost card so I wont talk about that but I absolutely adore firespirits. Positive elixir trade personified. Theyre versatile in that they can be used on defence or as part of a push.They work wonders in my zap bait deck because they do so much damage to a tower that they cant be ignored.  If the opponent zaps them thats one less thing to counter my other cards if my opponent ignores them the tower will kill  but  will land dealing massive damage on their tower comparable to a rocket. They also sometimes force my opponent to play a tank like a giant knight or valkyrie to absorb the damage which usually means the tank is played too close to the bridge to build a solid push behind it. Or they use a building to tank it which means their building is out of rotation against my hog.  Mindgames.    Amazing on defence knight  firespirits will take out ebarbs for a positive trade.

Not perfectly balanced of course he is really efficient against some decks but he isnt like prenerf Mega Minion or postbuff EBarbs. Just because you lose to him he isnt OP.

How did you first meet Nick Yarn and the other big time Clash Royale YouTubers?. Do you have a girlfriend? If so will you be doing a face reveal of her soon?. Are you willing to battle your fans on Royale?And my final question.... What is the greatest gift of all that Supercell has given us in the game?Thanks for taking the time to answer my questions it really means a lot to me.

Also instead of log id personally take arrrows as it clears minion hordes in the rare cases where you dont have a mecha or musket following your golem because you had to use it for defenses and so on. Other than that you may be missing a ecollectorpreference really I dont like ecollector tho unless its high level its probably just gonna get you neg trades.Golem is very good and in most cases gt giant so id def keep golem as its a beefy tank then splits into  extra decent mini tanks,ClashRoyale,dg4ray1,1,t5_3bog8

No because everyone has maxed cards and if ebarbs are the same lvl theyre not that great and too easy to counter. Theyre also not good in challenges and tourneys for the same reason.So if you nerf ebarbs to lower speed theyll suck even more in tourneys and challenges.

Player feedbackThe big one that forced this change was feedback. It was overwhelmingly negative towards RG. Reddit social media clash site everywhere. The metas that you speak of are created by people at the top. The nerds and netdeckers who come up with the perfect decks. Theyre not created by people in the  range. And RG is not the meta. It was only used in  decks out of the top . Its a bad card. Against scrubs in  range its easy because they see RG and shit their pants not knowing how to counter.

11620559,0,t3_65s60x,See Supercell got the Royal Giant and E barbs nerfs swapped.  A  sec deploy time increase on E barbs would be a great nerf because that cant be compensated for by overleveling them more. They would be a lot less of a reactive card and a lot less of a HOLY SHIT THEY JUST TELEPORTED TO MY TOWER card. For the Royal Giant a hit speed nerf is EXACTLY what he needs and the HP nerf helps too. If Royal Giant has a slower hit speed he will do less damage over time and give the opponent more time to react without letting the player build a bigger push.Geez  ,ClashRoyale,dgd795n,57,t5_3bog8

Right now theres only  cards that can actually support the golem the MM and the Baby Dragon and the main problem with the Golem is that SC refuses to fix the golemite glitch its completely RNG whether the tower targets the golemites or the support troops.,ClashRoyale,dgktrz8,1,t5_3bog8

Shuts down both lanes can counter graveyard without dying to poison did pretty good against lava loon etc. But yes I do agree the log weakness makes him a lower rated card but I do think the low health pool is logical because the card could still get tremendous value after a log...

Defensive troops  mini tank or tank killersWhat you are missing out are defensive troops.  Skeleton army is fine but its isnt sold enough as it can be countered by spells like log arrows and zap.  I suggest switch out ur baby drag to a knight or ice golem. Your deck is actually very similar to one of the top hog cycle decks. Just that its cheap efficient.
