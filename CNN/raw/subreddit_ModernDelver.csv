11533894,0,t3_64l040,I havent switched to the primary DS version thats running around but I added DS while still playing Delver of secrets.  Just plays like a bit more explosive version of normal Delver.I think DS was a natural evolution of Grixis since the manabase already hurt and Thoughtseize is just sort of better than other control elements re countermagic when you can lay big or meaningful threats in the first few turns.I doubt DS catches a ban it might be close to violating the share of meta criteria but its far from an unfair card.  I think the meta will adjust though and can.  Its not like there arent answers to DS or anything its trying to do.,ModernDelver,dg3das6,2,t5_3iquo
