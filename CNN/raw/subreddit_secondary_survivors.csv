2332224,0,t3_2ltyez,If you havent read it already this link from our sidebar is I believe the most applicable to you as to how you can best support her emotionally.Her parents abhorrent behavior wont ever stop. She needs to get out of that house ASAP even if she has to couch surf with friends. If nothing else you could call local womens shelters and see if they can help.Her younger sister as well if at all possible.I cannot stress enough the need to report her parents behaviour. The shelters will also have people on staff or the appropriate contact information who can help start a paper trail detailing their crimes. This isnt about punishing them its about ensuring they cannot harm any more people. However it is and will always be her and her sisters decision. So recommend it but dont push them into it.Lastly and I hope you dont mind I peeked at you other post. I actually know the person who linked you here and if Im right they meant to link you to rraisedbynarcissists This is a sub primarily for the friends and family of sexual assault survivors and how to deal with supporting them while also taking care of our own mental health. That sub is for the children and their SOs of abusive parents like youve described. I saved that for last because I dont want to make you think youre just being bounced around and no one cares. I hope you and your girlfriend will be able to be safe and happy you both deserve it.,secondary_survivors,clzz5d3,1,t5_2zt44

5889971,0,t3_3v8w6h,Hey! Its very sweet of you to be concerned to this depth you seem like a very loving partner. A survivor myself with PTSDC and that whole deal and having been watching the show myself as much there may be triggers there will ALWAYS be triggers. In everything and everything. This show and ones like it ensure endings though. And they may not be as happy or prett as we would like but in that universe hes not going to win he doesnt have friends and family sticking up for him she will not fall too hard without getting up even if he wins in the show that will be so that Jessica can break him down again. Mr TV is very good that way it will never be like in real life when baaad shit happens with no resolve justice sense or punishment of bad person. If she likes watching the show it probably feels empowering to her as with so many others myself included.I hoope you both have people to talk to outside of the relationship good luck!,secondary_survivors,cxrpjn5,1,t5_2zt44

You dont have to discuss your Moms tramatic event to protect a current victim but you dont know there are current victims.  Seriously you need to get counseling too...this is a very real and scary and life changing situation to deal wih on your own or on Reddit. ,secondary_survivors,d17gsv6,2,t5_2zt44
7668534,0,t1_d3dkxyc,I agree. She may be taking the forgive and forget too far ... hopefully not at the expense of her grandchildren.,secondary_survivors,d3dva4l,0,t5_2zt44

11062760,0,t3_5xvj6j,This girls had a hard life in some ways... but that doesnt excuse the way shes treating you.  Being raped by someone you trust doesnt turn you into someone who treats their partners like that thats something that people just are sometimes.  Its been a while now and youve seen who she is and youre right shes not likely to change.Once someone breaks up with you you should accept that and move on.  Testing you by dumping you is not appropriate behavior.  Perhaps if you move on shell learn that this behavior isnt okay.  If you stick around you will be telling her that its okay and she will never change.,secondary_survivors,dely21h,2,t5_2zt44
