4085735,0,t1_crlzto2,Understandable but you know its coming. From leafs and hockey. There will be pushback at first Im just trying to understand it myself with all the questions.,mapleleafs,crlzz9q,1,t5_2trv1
4086577,0,t1_crm3cyr,Some people on rleafs are just so fucking immature and thats why we went with a new sub.Look we did absolutely no advertising for this subreddit and yet you have rleafs users drawing everyone to it hoping to cause drama.,mapleleafs,crm3fks,-1,t5_2trv1
4088659,0,t3_37fs33,The easiest choices to me would be with Panik Kozun and Erixon.  Panik I would sign to a way contract expiring into his last year of RFA status for ..M  Kozun and Erixon I would try to sign them to way contracts worth kM with the Leafs for  year each. Give them an opportunity at training camp to see how things go.  Not sure if either would have to clear waivers to go to the Marlies.Kadri hes  btw and Bernier are... interesting.If Kadri is willing to resign for the remainder of his RFA years   or  years at .M I would do it.  If hes looking for M I would consider arbitration.  He hasnt earned a big  contract in my eyes but if it means eating up a bunch of his UFA years I would do it.Bernier I would honestly trade if possible.  Hes not elite hes probably not willing to stick out a rebuild and we could easily package him with Polak or Phaneuf to someone like Edmonton who need a  even if it is one of those  above average kind of s.  Bernier Polak and perhaps a couple of later picks  in  for Draisaitl.  Part of me feels like that is a steep price but the guy went  last year so maybe not.  Honestly if that did happen it makes someone like Holland or Gauthier expendable too to dangle in a package trade with a bigger contract.  Not that I want to lose either of those guys.  Just brainstorming as I write this.,mapleleafs,crmbyne,5,t5_2trv1
4096273,0,t3_37jbro,It kind of depends on what our relationship is with the team in question. If its a potential trade partner we dont want to sour with then no but a free pick is still a free pick and it would be really hard to avoid that temptation. ,mapleleafs,crn78ia,2,t5_2trv1
4104689,0,t1_cro5c5n,What do you think we could get in return for Boz and lups?,mapleleafs,cro5qsy,3,t5_2trv1
4112324,0,t1_crp0w96,Yeah but they account for that when they do their contracts. They know these are the things that are going to happen.,mapleleafs,crp13sl,1,t5_2trv1
4125065,0,t1_crqgvtf,Burakovsky would be great...too bad he plays for the Caps pI think you were meaning to say Bjorkstrand. He played super well and got a shitload of points this past year in jr albeit as a  yr. old. Had a good WJC though so thats more confronting. The Jackets also have Milano and Rychel. Both great prospects they can probably part with. ,mapleleafs,crqhdqx,1,t5_2trv1
4197001,0,t1_cryl41c,If its not the rd or th pick then Im not interested in losing JVR. Hes a solid forward  goals per season every team needs players like him to succeed.,mapleleafs,crynkbx,1,t5_2trv1
4227284,0,t1_crzimro,Alright I have to agree watching Rask rage quit the game made me so happy inside.,mapleleafs,cs234rx,2,t5_2trv1
4422705,0,t1_cso4f9o,I dont see it happening. People dont seem to value Kadri that much for some reason. He also had a dip in his points this season and with all the team suspensions and such.,mapleleafs,cso6cj2,2,t5_2trv1
