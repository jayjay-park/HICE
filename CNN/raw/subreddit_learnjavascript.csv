31407,0,t1_cehxwzl,Thanks that makes sense. I moved it to the top.For some reason I thought you had to place functions according to how they were called.  Since the validate function calls the generate function I thought validate would have to be beneath it in the code and thus at the bottom since generate calls the functions above it.  Is that not the case?,learnjavascript,cei0a0d,1,t5_2tugi
52975,0,t1_cekgeov,If we could get a new JSONlike format then Id be ecstatic. XML is incredibly verbose and we could do away with a lot of the antiquated tags. The paradigm wouldnt change though. You still want to provide a simple document for the layout of the page with no real logic inside. Its always good to separate your presentation from your logic. Likewise its good to separate your style from your layout so wed still have a CSS equivalent even if its in JSON.,learnjavascript,cekgm9x,1,t5_2tugi

273767,0,t3_1x8npe,. Yes ActiveX is an IE only thing and almost nobody in their right mind would use it.  That said this might be one case where using it would accomplish what you are looking to do but it will not work on any other browser.  Im not an ActiveX person so you are on your own.. Historically writing to the file system from a browser is not allowed.  Its a security thing.  There are some new JS APIs that might allow this but you are moving way out of beginner territory here.,learnjavascript,cf94yzz,1,t5_2tugi
326685,0,t3_1xrp9f,I started doing the lesson. Its a bit tricky now you can see why nested ifelse statements arent the best thing to use. Always use brackets. Always. I think I see the problem however Im not  sure and will continue for a bit. Think of it as a logic puzzle. Write it down in human sentences if it helpsYou have two people person  and person.If person chooses rock and if person chooses scissors person wins. If person chooses paper person wins.If person chooses paper and if person chooses scissors person wins. If person chooses rock person wins etc. I think what you were doing is not putting it in the right if statement. Remember to think about the structure and hierarchy of the problem. If person chooses rock what if person chooses paper and what if person chooses scissors? Theres a double nested if statement there    if person chooses rock         if person chooses paper            paper wins        if person chooses scissors            rock wins        if choice  choice         return The result is a tie!     now here are the multiple outcomes      First choice was the same as choice. Now we start with the code logic. What if choice was rock?     else if choice  rock              if choice  scissors   So choice is rock what if choice was scissors?                 return Rock Wins!                        if choice  paper   Now what happens when choice is paper? Paper beats rock                return Paper Wins!                 else if choice  paper   Getting tired of the ifs yet? What if choice was paper?            if choice  scissors                 return Scissors Win!                        if choice  rock                  return Rock Wins!                 else if choice  scissors             if choice  rock                 return Rock Wins!                        if choice  paper                 return Scissors Wins!                also make sure to use lowercase with strings. However Im not entirely sure why do they use three equals  instead of two?This code did work but I want you to understand why yours didnt instead of just copying and pasting. Think about the logical flow of a problem as I tried to show in the above human example. Write it down in pseudocode basically just code in sentence form if needed. It really helps! If you have any more trouble feel free to shoot me a PM! This is an awesome subreddit as well. Good luck!Quick Edit I think I see your problem. On the code you added to the function just below your third if statement as well as to all remember you are dealing with  possilities. Choice could be rock scissors or paper. It may be as simple as not specifying which one. You used if choice somthing return something ELSE return another something. However it could be  outcomes not just . Id specify exactly what you want to happen. Instead of having an else write IF choice is scissors and if choice is paper scissors wins not else IF choice is rock rock wins. I wouldnt do the if choice is paper scissors wins else rock wins. But maybe Im not thinking it through.   ,learnjavascript,cfemqvq,1,t5_2tugi

Consider that the decimal  can also be expressed like a polynomial                   ... forever    or                ...What y  x   does is extract the last digit of x and add it to y.Then x  Math.floorx effectively throws away that last digit and shifts the others to the right.y   shifts all of ys digits to the left and makes room to add the next digit extracted from the end of x.This continues until Math.floorx returns  which will happen after x lt  i.e. the last digit has been extracted.,learnjavascript,cfqohdp,2,t5_2tugi

579223,0,t1_cg5zt8b,As lumberbrain has put it just use localStorage i.e. browser storage to do this. Almost no one knows about it who isnt a developer and its supported all the way back to IE  !!  Its also very easy to use. Browser storage offers two options localStorage lt persistent and lasts forever unless explicitly cleared sessionStorage lt persistent for the current browsing session like a session cookie but note that this only applies to the current window or tabAssuming you get the ID you can use the following code below to set the browser storage     Lets say the id is          First lets use localStorage    localStorage.setItemvideoid      That simple! To retrieve it you can use either    localStorage.getItemvideoid    gt returns      OR    localStorage.videoid gt dot notation returns the same     you can use the exact same code for sessionStorage     by simply using sessionStorage instead    sessionStorage.setItemvideoid      All other aspects of the browser storage are the same    sessionStorage.videoid gt Of course browser storage is for the current domain so if this is an issue with crossing between domains youll have to think of another method. You could always come up with some sort of code  way of obfuscating the data to a degree so that what you see in the URL isnt exactly the ID for example offset each number by  or something like that then parse the value in JavaScript and recompute it,learnjavascript,cg641mj,2,t5_2tugi

774685,0,t3_230hq7,Im going on  months of learning javascript. Since it wasnt long ago I was just starting out I feel like my advice will be valuable to you. First of all I have tried just about ever pay to learn site there is. CodeSchool TeamTreeHouse Tuts Lynda.com. I must say at first I found them very helpful especially CodeSchool and Tuts. If I knew then what I know now this is what I would have done. Follow this guide. This has helped me tremendously. The articles on that site are excellent and help explain a lot of things. It also starts from the very beginning expecting no experience with programming or JavaScript. . www.codewars.com. I cannot get enough of codewars it has made me a better programmer and has helped me learn JavaScript as a language better than any pay for learning site has. It may not teach you the DOM but you should understand that the DOM is only a small part of JavaScript. To better utilize the DOM you need to understand JavaScript and its built in methods first. . Build something anything. For example last week I built a todo list.  Now Im back at codewars going to try and build something else later this week. Maybe even start blogging about my journey with JS. Dont get caught up in pay for learning sites. They can be helpful but they really only cover the same things codeacademy does. CodeSchool is an exception. This can actually be challenging. It teaches you more advanced concepts but I wasnt a big fan of the GUI.

Arrays arent necessarily inorder sorted but they do have an order to them as in some items come before other items.An example could be an array of strings such as book titles.  Using an array you could sort them alphabetically.Objects are used when the items in a collection are of different types.  An example might be a book object that has a collection of properties like a title string a copyright date date and a sale price number    var book                     title The Stinky Cheese Man                  published                   price .

Ill write a workflow on how this should be done use chrome.webRequest API onBeforeRequest to cancel requests made to unwanted sites chrome documentation has an example for this even chrome provides ability to create option pages for extensions. Use chrome.storage API to store and get the list of blacklisted domains you could use chrome.injectJS api and inject JavaScript into the tab to display the warning instead of closing the tab annoyinglyThe only big issue is testing for correct matching patterns and updating the blocked domain list in background script once user has done changes to the list.

Ive tried it a million different ways and almost all of my solutions result in            .Using this advicegt Start by writing a function that rages a element array as input a single range and returns the string you want. You can then use map to apply that to a list of ranges.Ive written the code a close as I can possibly think to what youre explaining.    var myArray          var newArray  myArray.mapfunction       return myArray      myArray        console.lognewArrayWhen I look at this code it looks correct to me but this is my first time using the map method so Im not sure where Ive gone wrong. On MDN it says it will run the function I provide on each element of the array that I run the method on.I feel like I have to write a loop somewhere but all the various loops Ive written have not given me the results Im looking for.I cant wait to hear back from you because every time you say something I take one step forward.Thank you ahead of time.,learnjavascript,cr825v9,1,t5_2tugi

4340396,0,t3_3aq3n4,by assigning window.kobana  window.goban youre making them the same array. If you do any updates to goban it will be updating the same array that kobana is now pointing to.  Also because theyre the same array window.gobanwindow.kobanb is always true.  Also if they were separate arrays even if they had the same values window.gobanwindow.kobanb would always be false since the comparison of two arrays does not involve checking for comparison of all array values just the arrays themselves.if you want to make copies you can easily do that with the slice method    window.kobana  window.goban.sliceFor comparisons you need to go a little deeper than .  If youre using any libraries like underscore you have access to helper methods like .isEqual which can be used to compare or you can write a function yourself which loops through and compares the array values.  You might also be able to get away with something like if window.goban.toString  window.kobanb.toString if you just need something simple though not always entirely accurate depending on what youre storing in your array.,learnjavascript,csew5j1,2,t5_2tugi

To transpose a matrix is to go from                  to                  The function    var transpose  functionmatrix         return fun.applyfun.map fun.array matrix    These fun.f are my own functions they are not exactly like the ones in Ramda. My functions take more arguments and behave like they would in a few other languages for example Lisp.apply works like thisapplyf x array  fx array array array ...And map with more than  arguments works like thismapf array array  farray array farray array ...Pretty neat that we were able to write transpose on one line! I absolutely do not consider this to be obfuscated or anything like that even though it might look like that for a beginner.I recommend that you check out the functions in Ramda on their documentation page just to get some ideas.

4645505,0,t1_ctg3mys,Another fun fact about promises is that they may only resolve or reject ONCE. If you try to resolve them twice then they will throw. This is a very good reason to prefer the return new Promiseresolve reject gt   do stuff  syntax as it helps ensure this never happens.There are three more common Promise things we will cover. A common thing for a dev to want is for a function not to run until two or more promises have resolved. Heres a quick example    var urls  something.json another.json third.json    for each url start a request and return the promise so we have an array of promises    var promiseArray  urls.mapurl gt getJSONurl    each item in resultArr represents the returned value of one promise    Promise.allpromiseArray when all promises succeed or one of them rejects      .thenresultArr gt resultArr.mapresult gt addToDatastoreresult for each result add it to the datastore      .catcherr gt console.logone of your responses failed   err runs if any one of the promises failThe next common task is that you want to run something as soon as the first promise returns. Promise.racepromArr takes an array of promises and runs its .then functions with whichever value returns first thus the name race.The final task is resolving a promise immediately. This can be useful in things like datastores so the user always receives a promise    we could do something like    return new Promiseresolve reject gt resolve    but theres a good shorthand for this    return Promise.resolve    heres a datastore that always returns a promise    var makeDS  function        var items   well store each item by its uuid      var getItemById  id gt         if we already have the item return a promise with it immediately        if itemsid            return Promise.resolveitems.id        if we dont have it return a promise that contains the new item from the server after adding it to our local db         else           return getJSONitem  id  .json            .thenitem gt               itemsid  item              return item                                return         getItemById getItemById        items items              var db  makeDB make a db        db.getItemByIdfoo.thenitem gt console.logitem fetches foo from the server    db.getItemByIdfoo.thenitem gt console.logitem returns the local itemThe beauty of this is that you always get the same response no matter if the data is local or not. Ive seen a lot of sites without promises where either the UI would grind to a halt until the data comes from the server or the page keeps pinging the db to ask if the datas there yet a lot of awful web design out there.I hope this has been helpful.

By default the browser will put all variables and function names in your javascript files into the global namespace. Any javascript file will be able to access the variables of any other javascript. But when you use the module pattern in each of your javascript files you are essentially scoping the variables names to each file.

6658056,0,t1_d07zr3n,Oh. Well given that capital letters start at ASCII value  and lowercase starts at  you could do this assuming that your numbering system for instance is that  is AZ and  is az    arr          arr.mapfunction i       return String.fromCharCodei  i lt  ?       .joinWhich returns BdEDT.This is a total codegolf solution though so Ill explain it a bit. Basically you have your array of values as above. Everything under  is interpreted as a capital and over is lowercase.So Array.prototype.map creates a new copy of the arr variable and everything that we return inside applies to each of the indexes in the array.So basically for each of the numbers it applies the String.fromCharCode function that turns an ASCII code into the corresponding character. See the table here Since yours are  for capitals though and on the ASCII table they are  we need to add  to each value. For the lowercase they start at  but yours start at  so we need to add     to convert to the ASCII value.To do this easily though we use a ternary expression which is i lt  ?    which says if i lt  return  if true and  if false.So the full statement then becomes i   ||  basically depending on the results of the ternary equation.So the Array.prototype.map returns an array of the results which in this case looks like B d E D T so we chain the Array.prototype.join function to join the array into a string.Hope that helps.,learnjavascript,d08012j,2,t5_2tugi

That statement is what does the copying of the values.  this in updateItem refers to the ltinputgt element because that handler was attached to the input elements.  Its getting the value from the ltinputgt element and assigning to the innerHTML of the ltspangt element which is the previous sibling of the ltinputgt element in the tree.This code is broken for other reasons which is why the hiding of the ltinputgt and the showing of the ltspangt doesnt work correctly but its not because of that line.,learnjavascript,d18qd9b,3,t5_2tugi

And of course have the user input any playlist from youtube to use. Basically a power hour. I would definitely love to see a simplified version if you feel inclined. I think part of the mess comes from the way I test things or implement something one way and then realize it doesnt work the way I want and then I delete the code and just insert a new block of code in its place. Which is why you can probably see code that writes to divs that arent there. I have a terrible workflow is what it usually is.

The context is lexical meaning it uses the value of this as it exists where the arrow function was defined.  Other functions will dynamically define context based on how theyre called so if you want to enforce theyre this to be a specific value i.e. the constructed instance you would want to bind. This also applies to methods defined in the class body rather the in constructor.  They too would need to be bound if you intend on calling them without the instance.  ,learnjavascript,d3fgxyp,4,t5_2tugi

9064843,0,t3_54f7e9,Its about hiding data and functionality  making things private.If you take a simpler i.e. less modular approach to defining this object you might have something like this      var basket        function doSomethingElsePrivate         ...                var basketModule               Add items to our basket        addItem function values            basket.pushvalues                     Get the count of items in the basket        getItemCount function            return basket.length                    doSomething function            ...                     Get the total value of items in the basket        getTotal function                var q  this.getItemCount              p                while q             p  basketq.price                        return p              This does the job.  Functionally it does the same thing the original example does.  One problem is however that it creates  variables in the current scope likely global here basket doSomethingElsePrivate and basketModule instead of just the main one to be used basketModule.  That could be a problem because somewhere else the user might decide to make their own basket variable and screw with the one basketModule here depends on.What can we do to fix that?  One solution is to put them in the basketModule object.  Thatll get them out of the way      var basketModule                    basket                 doSomethingElsePrivate function            ...                     Add items to our basket        addItem function values            this.basket.pushvalues                     Get the count of items in the basket        getItemCount function            return this.basket.length                    doSomething function            ...                     Get the total value of items in the basket        getTotal function                var q  this.getItemCount              p                while q             p  this.basketq.price                        return p              Now global is left with only a single reference to basketModule. The other values that were external are defined internally with that object.But what if youre still not trusting enough of the user?  What if you want to make it harder for them to make a mistake  a mistake like setting basket to null.  Doing that would break all the methods that work with basket since they expect it to be an array.  You need a way to tell the user not to mess with that value basket or doSomethingElsePrivate in this example.  Thats where making it private comes into play.  In JS a common convention is to use an underscore  prefix for these properties such as      var basketModule                    basket                 doSomethingElsePrivate function            ...                 ...But it doesnt really hide anything and is still dependent on the user respecting that convention.  To really make something private it needs to be accessible to the methods of basketModule but not anywhere else.  A way to do this in JavaScript is by creating functions methods within a scope that is unique to the creation of those functions.Scopes in JavaScript are created through function calls.  Every time you call a function a new scope is created that represents a space in which values can be defined unique to that function call.  Additionally functions can be closures in that when created they can reference variables outside of their own scope as long as those variables are within scope at the functions definition.  So given the methods of basketModule they can be closures accessing variables in a parent scope and if that scope is in a function that only contains those methods and a few variables those methods are the only guys that can access them.  Basically this means jumping back to the first variation where variables were defined in global but wrapping them up in a function so that they dont get defined in global. Instead theyre local function variables but still accessible to the methods of basketModule.  But because basketModule is also local to the function we need to get it out somehow... but thats simply a matter of returning it from the function call.  Then back in global we can redefine it by the same name.    function createBasketModule        var basket        function doSomethingElsePrivate         ...                var basketModule               Add items to our basket        addItem function values            basket.pushvalues                     Get the count of items in the basket        getItemCount function            return basket.length                    doSomething function            ...                     Get the total value of items in the basket        getTotal function                var q  this.getItemCount              p                while q             p  basketq.price                        return p                          return basketModule            var basketModule  createBasketModuleOf course now we have the problem again that we have another variable in global instead of just basketModule. Now theres also the createBasketModule function.  Its only ever used once  just for the purpose of creating that unique scope for the hidden basket and doSomethingElsePrivate values so we can apply a little trickery and define it as an Immediately Invoked Function Expression IIFE calling it immediately as its being defined so the function itself doesnt even get defined anywhere. Its expression resolves to the functions return value before that can even happen.  We can do something similar with basketModule in the create function returning its literal directly instead of assigning it to a variable first.    var basketModule  function        var basket        function doSomethingElsePrivate         ...                return              Add items to our basket        addItem function values            basket.pushvalues                     Get the count of items in the basket        getItemCount function            return basket.length                    doSomething function            ...                     Get the total value of items in the basket        getTotal function                var q  this.getItemCount              p                while q             p  basketq.price                        return p                        So the outermost function is being called in the expression where its defined meaning it becomes the value it returns which is an object with a bunch of methods in it that ultimately get defined to the global basketModule.  But because those methods are defined in that function they and they alone have access to the local function variables basket and doSomethingElsePrivate meaning those variables are effectively private and hidden away from anyone else messing with them.continued in next reply...,learnjavascript,d81g4l2,1,t5_2tugi

Its designed to give you sound but quick survey of what front end development are all about along with tools.

10915514,0,t3_5vy7zq,setTimeout is as being part of the loop block executed in the loop.  Whats executed outside the loop is the callback function you give to setTimeout.  The whole purpose of setTimeout is to delay the execution of some arbitrary block of code  defined in a function  at some point later in the future.  When setTimeout itself runs in the loop it takes in a function object and a time value and sets aside the function for the specified time.  Then at that time through some background process inherent to the system the function is executed.  The functions are defined in the loop but not actually called there.,learnjavascript,de5uwf1,2,t5_2tugi

11112714,0,t3_5yo4fx,This code is Initializing the list to null. Stepping through the array backwards. Adding the list value as the rest key. Reassigning the list value as an object with the value of i and rest as the previous list. Doing this for the length of the array in this case .This might be easier to understand  it might also not be very helpful  but heres another way to write this    function arrayToListarr       return arr.reverse.reducerest value gt         return           value value          rest rest               null    This is obviously less performant as were reversing the whole array before creating the list but this is basically doing the same thing in a more declarative way. This code reverses the array initializes the rest to null for each element in the array it creates a new object where the rest key is the previous rest the first time it will be null but all other iterations will be the previously created object and the value key is set to the current value  or  in this case. returns that object.Hopefully this helps but let me know if I didnt explain anything clearly enough.,learnjavascript,derm7qw,2,t5_2tugi

11691816,0,t3_66n8i8,You can see in the Google Chrome console what are the contents of the function just by doing a console.log and passing the function in just like Asha told you. Other neat thing you can do is use the debugger also in Google Chrome or in Visual Code which is very good. If you are using atom you can maybe download a package.A debugger if someone is not familiar with the concept can help you debug your app. For example you set a breakpoint for the program in runtime to make a pause then you can follow the logic of the application as it runs and which variables are set to what and a lot of other neat things.In this exact case Functions is whats called in JavaScript First Class Functions or Higher Order that means it can be passed as arguments try to see as a memory standpoint. You are running the function you pass when you set it to the same parameter as the one you are running in your block of code and the argument that the function expects to the function.in processUserInput you are passing the variable name which takes the function greeting so it knows it will have to run that later then goes and prompts the user to set the variable that the greeting function will take as an argument. Once it has the argument it passes that to the greeting function the function that it was passed to processUserInput and runs that normally.Hope it clears some of the confusion again you can use the things i described first to appease your developer needs.,learnjavascript,dglaac8,1,t5_2tugi
