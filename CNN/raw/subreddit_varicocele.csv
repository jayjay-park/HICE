8706966,0,t3_4yziqv,Hi my dude. Thanks for your post. I just found this thread from just typing this kind of thing and just happened to be on reddit. Ive been diagnosed with an epidydimal cyst on one of my testicles and it is very very small. Unfortunately im in that incredibly small and lucky group where the cyst HURTS. Im used to being a very active athletic person and in fact cycling is my favorite thing to do as far as exercise. I started having pain some months ago and finally got tests done as I received insurance again and it turned out to be that. I want to do the testosterone test as well because I think I might have to do the surgery I just cant live with this thing for the rest of my life. Ive had it for about  months and its changing my entire life. I started wearing jocks for support and they helped a lot while I was off my bike but after a month I decided to start riding again as the dr okayd me and after two big rides in comfortable postions my testicles are back to the pain they were when it first started to really hurt. Thinking about getting the surgery but scared of not being able to have children,varicocele,d6u07w9,2,t5_39bsz
