9182486,0,t3_54ee2c,I dont know if youve figured this out yet but its as easy as installing a gtk theme. I think I just grabbed some random gnome gtk theme as it was pretty small.For example if you use arch linux    sudo pacman S breezegtkThat should be enough.,awesomewm,d8fy4lc,1,t5_2s8kq
10395134,0,t1_dcma4hg,Oh OK I didnt realize it changed that recently. I had a surprise rc.lua bork this afternoon when I updated laingit so I switched over to the git version of awesome  too.,awesomewm,dcmcsds,1,t5_2s8kq
10472631,0,t1_dcj0gio,I have to speak more verbosely. What I imagine is something like a custom menubar for each tag. This menubar should be placed in the top wibox. Each menubar should contain some scripts. If I choose  select a script via mouse click or stroke enter this script should be executed. What is sure is that the executed script should send some commands to a specific terminal which is already open. Is that possible?,awesomewm,dcv6iib,1,t5_2s8kq
10534194,0,t1_dd21xrz,The big problem of using unmanage is that Awesome gets any client except Rofi if I spawn a terminal using it the desktop wont return to its normal state unless I close that terminal the same happens if I open Nautilus Rhythmbox or any other program. Awesome will only focus on clients that are not Rofi so closing it after running a command does not have any effect on the desktop like it was unmanage every client BUT rofi.I dont know how to tell Awesome I want Rofi to be the client it focuses on. Using an if client.name  rofi I know the name by using xprop does not seem to fix anything. As far as I could test this comparison always fails becasue client is never Rofi but a terminal Nautilus or whatever. This situation is generated with this alternative version of the program which I used folllowing a Stack Overflow answer      From PROmpt COMmand      procom  rofi show run      awful.key modkey  r function  awful.util.spawnprocom         mywiboxmouse.screen.visible  false         awesome.util.spawnblur         client.connectsignalunmanage functionc            if c.name  rofi then                 mywiboxmouse.screen.visible  true                 awesome.util.spawnunblur            end         end         endThis alternative makes my wibar disappear and my wallpaper to blur but cannot make it reappear it cant enter the if statement for the reason I have mentioned before.Thats why I have been trying another method using shell commands I feel more comfortable with to try to solve the problem. By now I have reported an issue to Rofis GitHub page and Im waiting to read what they can do about it. Thank you for your response. Its been some time since I came across this problem and its driving me crazy.,awesomewm,dd2613p,1,t5_2s8kq
