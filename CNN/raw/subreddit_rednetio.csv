2647513,0,t3_2q85jk,The given example does not demonstrates a pitfall of callback APIs for me  this is a circular dependency logger gt db gt logger and this is bad in ALL APIs not just in callbackbased ones.Also he uses threading in parallel with async processing. He mixes callbackbased API multithreading programming and bad practices. You can address all of these problems easily with minimum planning.EDIT if you do it the good way the logger should handle the db connection itslef as this is an independent module. Best the application simply throws to stdout and the rest is handled outside of the app because IMO logging in multiple destinations should not be handled by the app.,rednetio,cn45tw2,1,t5_31yi2
