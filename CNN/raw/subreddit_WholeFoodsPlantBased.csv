Not enough for shortterm problems but arsenic causes different cancers and contributes to heart disease.  Different governments have safe levels of arsenic for drinking water but not for rice. New recommendations are for limiting brown rice to once or twice a week.  That wouldnt surprise anyone talking about other grains but brown rice has has an elevated reputation as healthy food.,WholeFoodsPlantBased,db3k709,3,t5_2w8lz
10778958,0,t1_ddqx5km,Yeah I thought about my comment later on last night.  Those arent really sauces so much as thestuffiputonmyfoodtomakeitnotdry.  And I should have said I water or broth those down too.  Certainly Soy  Miso would be a little salty by itself.  Last night for instance it was rice green beans carrots spinach and butter beans.  All cooked in some Miso broth.  And then put a big dollop of homemade hummus.  The hummus provides a lot of saucylike enhancement to the dish.Let me know if you run across a plant friendly version of  Island Dressing though.  I miss stuff like that.,WholeFoodsPlantBased,ddrrs0q,1,t5_2w8lz
