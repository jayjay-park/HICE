Despite this progress a literature survey that we have performed suggests that a large number of reported solar cell efficiencies are being incorrectly measured and reported in journals with the device efficiency being overestimated in many cases. Our survey of  papers in  journals which compared published values of external quantum efficiency with the measured shortcircuit current density shows that over  of publications report data or make claims that overestimate the efficiency of solar cells. Such a frequent occurrence of incorrect datareporting risks damaging the credibility and reliability of the field. Thus it is imperative that the community ensures that articles are published with correct efficiency values. This is only possible if responsible data collection and analysis follows widelyrecognized methodologies or can be traced to accredited standard laboratories.,RenewableTech,ckh94kv,2,t5_3274a
