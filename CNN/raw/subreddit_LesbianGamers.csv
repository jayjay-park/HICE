3615947,0,t1_cq4fq6w,No no no! This is actually something Ive been picking up on too. When I took a look around Chloe and Rachels junk yard shack in Ep  some things I had questions about were confirmed in my mind. I dont want to ruin it for anyone else but it seemed like a were saying it without saying it thing on the part of DontNod. Also Chloe is jealous of Maxs time and attention in a way I find hard to believe is only friendly. Even for a high school girl.,LesbianGamers,cq4fzq0,3,t5_2rhx6

6965608,0,t3_49lobe,Yep.  I had a horrible crush on Aribeth de Tylmarande in Neverwinter Nights so I made a male alt to romance her.Summon Knight is one of the few games where a female shows some interest in you even though your alt is a female.  SWTORs Shadow of Revan expansion has some ff and mm interactions.,LesbianGamers,d15vyf8,1,t5_2rhx6

9924054,0,t1_db13sxb,Yeah piper is fun I just finished the DLCs sort of I was disappointed that if youre roleplaying a good character nukaworld is really hollow and while there is a quest to wipe out the raiders theres no reward and no closure so I started a new character to be specifically bad made her look all dark and dangerous so I can enjoy the nuka world content to its fullest.,LesbianGamers,db14nri,1,t5_2rhx6

I mainly like to watch her YT content. Recently she started a podcast with another streamer I think named AmandatheJedi. They got a podcast called Powered Down if you want to check it out.,LesbianGamers,dg5jzbk,1,t5_2rhx6
