5790790,0,t3_3uekyb,Unfortunately the most important attributes are damage defense reduction and skill mastery but they are under represented in the power rating. Lesser attributes like pres crit etc. stack up in huge numbers but they dont nearly mean as much in a battle outcome. This can lead to characters stacking up massive battle ratings yet being complete pushovers.Its even worse for mages. Not only does their primary stat have the weakest attribute growth the weakest  from mres which is boosted by the lowest priority relic and MPr which means nothing but the MP bonus from their off hand also doesnt give a proper power bonus. This causes me to have K less power than other heroes keeping me stuck with heroes that have  less damage than myself.,Ezpzrpg,cxewhse,1,t5_37ck7

I personally did not get past Steel Dancer in the  and  trials myself when at that level.
