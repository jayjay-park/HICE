Rick and Morty means so much to me because it allowed me to finally take control of myself and find peace. I realized just how pointless everything actually is. The fact that one day everything is just going to be nothing is what calms me. It allows me to truly move past things that have happened. Look you can influence this world but you cant actually change it. You didnt do this. I used to be a decent sized dealer to several school districts when in high school. I introduced many young men to substances. Some of them are now on their ways to success while some of them are dead. It truly is the way the news goes. Allow yourself to find peace.

5491158,0,t1_cwdhb3g,Great points! I am  with you on believing that Morty isnt that dumb. Hes shown himself to be quite capable in a variety of scenarios and after all hes only ! So if there is a legitimate cloaking mechanism between the Rick waves and the Morty waves Id wager it isnt directly related to Mortys dumbness and Ricks genius. The waves could counterbalance each other for a variety of reasons  maybe its the difference between Ricks callousness and Mortys compassion who the hell knows.Im still of the mind that Cs love for Morty is unique or rare though. Im remembering not only the Morty coupons but also the way the Ricks at the Councils headquarters were doing things like selling Morty accessories and Morty insurance. It really feels like Mortys are a replaceable commodity to most of the other Ricks whereas to C Morty is a human shield and his grandson. Also I think some of the other Ricks are likely still in danger from their respective Federations and other entities too  even if they play by the rules the Ricks are among the smartest beings in the central finite curve and thus continually vulnerable to races like the Zigerions trying to capture them and exploit their genius. ,c137,cwdjox3,16,t5_3394c
