Once you send a message to udragontoes she will send them a message and await a response as well. She will then relay to you what the trader has said. If it is satisfactory then she will urge you to accept.Banning someone is a last step and it is a pointless one actually. All they have to do iz make a new name and start over.

It is not  complete but it is definitely an overhaul if you view the site in nonapp browser. I am also hoping that users like the flair system at least in regards to the aesthetics. We will iron out all final details of how the system will work once we get some feedback from the community on that as well.In regards to retroactive flair credit that is certainly an aspect that we have discussed and we plan to grandfather in as many verified traders as we can based on public confirmation from both parties of a trade. More information about this will be available on October st.  Hope you like the changes but please never hesitate to offer up suggestions!,legotrade,cktjlkf,2,t5_2v43u

6854632,0,t3_48dhly,Bad trade with uJojoyojimbi. He believes he should get special treatment so he decided not to ship his end until after he got my package. This was never discussed or agreed upon. I did not find out until days after shipment when I asked him if he had shipped yet. Thats when I found out he didnt plan on shipping until he got his end. He is a dishonest person that lied by omission. He didnt end up sending his end until a week after I sent mine. He did all of this despite me having  successful trades which is significantly more than him. I will not be trading with him again and I recommend others avoid him as well.,legotrade,d0ta47q,2,t5_2v43u

I took out the Joker Henchman he was an impulse pick anyway.  The only outlier for me in this case is the  figures.  They arent new in their case they are the set so new to me would mean boxed so I wouldnt want them at that price. How about we split the difference on that one between last  months and lowest that brings it to around .  The leaves my side short a bit you said there were some other lower priority figures you wanted?  Ive still got plenty left but Ive made deals for most of the LotR figures already just a lonely Aragorn remains.EDIT I lied theres one Rohan soldier leftIf you dont agree on the price change with the  we can just drop them from the deal altogether that works too.,legotrade,d904omn,1,t5_2v43u

10750305,0,t3_5ttajw,Traders with less than  brick flair are required to send their end of a trade first and it must be received by the minimum  brick flair trader before they send their end of the trade. For two traders under  brick flair it is at your own discretion when to send. Check a users reddit history vet them and do your homework.
