If its not too bad you can fill out in with wood glue and cover it with filler putty. If you want it to look pristine again youll have to sand it down and repaint.,fender,d3zmcwm,1,t5_2s6we

Easy way to tell if the neck is ok or not is play a chord and shake the guitar a little to get a bend in the sound. A cheep neck will bend the note very easily and most of the time change the tuning. ,fender,d8hobud,1,t5_2s6we
