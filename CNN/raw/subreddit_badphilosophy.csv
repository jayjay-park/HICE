299500,0,t1_cfbof0f,The thing with koans is that they are generally from the very specific tradition of ChanZen Buddhism which specifically rejected study rationality and verbal communication as a means of ascertaining profound truth. The closest parallel would be something like the Cynics particularly Diogenes Laertes anecdotes about them so judging them in terms of philosophical rigor is sort of missing the point. I think that to a product of Western education Confucianism would be more interesting particularly NeoConfucianism although Xunzi and Wang Chong seem to be pretty popular these days.It is pretty unfortunate until the nineteenth century there was plenty of Western engagement with Confucian and other Chinese philosophy and culture Voltaire for example really admired Confucius and the Imperial examination system was the inspiration for the modern civil service but the racial and colonialist ideologies of the nineteenth century tended to reject the ability to actually learn things from lesser racesexcept of course those who thought that perceived Oriental mysticism would allow them to escape the suffocating logical traditions of Western culture. So a sort of mystified tradition dominates Western perception of Chinese thought that is entirely out of keeping with any actual environment within China. I mean at the same time that Newton was spending most of his time searching for the Philosophers Stone and the Temple of Solomon Chinese scholars were analyzing the value of ritual from a perspective not far from modern sociology and openly mocking occult knowledge.gthmmm... couldnt something similar be said about Western Philosophy? Unless as you put it when we say Western Philosophy we simply mean field of study that references Plato.I really just meant in terms of lumping Indian and Chinese philosophy together.,badphilosophy,cfbt4uo,3,t5_2sa6z

367827,0,t3_1y8ciy,Somewhat relevant For those who are interested in what a real Bayesian statistician thinks about philosophy of statistics see here AbstractgtA substantial school in the philosophy of science identifies Bayesian inference withinductive inference and even rationality as such and seems to be strengthened by therise and practical success of Bayesian statistics. We argue that the most successfulforms of Bayesian statistics do not actually support that particular philosophy but ratheraccord much better with sophisticated forms of hypotheticodeductivism. We examinethe actual role played by prior distributions in Bayesian models and the crucial aspects ofmodel checking and model revision which fall outside the scope of Bayesian confirmationtheory. We draw on the literature on the consistency of Bayesian updating and also onour experience of applied work in social science. Clarity about these matters shouldbenefit not just philosophy of science but also statistical practice. At best the inductivistview has encouraged researchers to fit and compare models without checking them atworst theorists have actively discouraged practitioners from performing model checkingbecause it does not fit into their frameworkNote the first couple sentences are a stick in the eye of LW folks.,badphilosophy,cfiw2oq,2,t5_2sa6z

On top of that Im also pretty sure the allies realised that the city wasnt a hub for transporting troops in any significant number which is why they only ever referred to the plan as a means of breaking German morale and why the Russians didnt include the city in their request that the Allies target other transport centres.

Does it need to be a human observer or can it be a cat or bug? If panpsychism is true then Pluto might have a point of view though probably not a very deep one. Sometimes it seems like you dont even need someone to actually hold a point of view for it to remain a point of view for instance if I imagine someone who genuinely believes  then its not obvious why that isnt a point of view by which  can be true from. There are also points of view that nobody holds anymore. But I would say that if no point of view can be found then we might be justified in saying that something didnt happen.gt Or maybe that differing perspectives at the very least call into question the veracity of every action in the universe?Not quite. Think of it more like this. Say that youre a hindu and Im a muslim. Its not that at least one of us is wrong but rather that we might not live in the same reality as each other and in the reality of my conscious experience there actually is Allah doing all the stuff hes supposed to do and in yours there really is Krishna and his buddies and the two of us each see the other as mistaken because from where we stand it actually is crazy to hold the others view.gt Personally Im relatively heh certain that events in the universe occur regardless of my knowledge of them.Its hard to make this argument without assuming it to be true.

To get a start on this subject I would recommend picking up Lowes An Introduction to the Philosophy of Mind and Mortons A Historical Introduction to the Philosophy of Mind and reading through this  That should give you a good basic foundation in the kinds of issues that are at stake in this field.

3556217,0,t1_cpxmeyk,Ok so again Im really trying to be as nice as I can here despite our obviously different views on this but Im getting the impression you still suspect Im somehow secretly a cunt. I hope that doesnt stick as my honest intention is not to convince you of anything rather just understand where Im coming from a bit better. Onward..gt If your core argument is that religion is wrong because its not reasonable and relies on claims that are unsubstantiatedIm not arguing that its definitely wrong but in my view we dont have any good reason to believe its right. I do hope you acknowledge that distinction because its important.I personally am yet to see any substantiation for religious claims. That doesnt mean Im sure they dont exist although I do suspect it otherwise why would I have not seen them right?. Therefore from where Im sitting the more reasonable position is to reserve belief. Once more I dont expect you to agree only recognise why I would see this as the most reasonable place to rest.gt then its kind of your number one priority to make sure your own fold doesnt include people who are falling for overwhelmingly unreasonable and irrational positions.Well I dont really have a fold per say  most atheists wouldnt say they do  but of course youre right and I very much do argue with other atheists if I think theyre not being rational or what have you. Outside the context of religion arguments about rationalism and skepticism and secularism and so on continue. And a lot of people are just young  young people go through phases of thinking all kinds of weird dumb shit. Thats the case no matter what. Theres not much we can do other than engage with those who wish to be engaged and in the most civil terms discuss these things. So basically yeah I agree. Fix your own backyard. Totally with you.gt which nobody in ratheism understands at all but consistently bellyaches about and does have realworld consequencesBroad brush strokes but ok. I mean at least the politics generally speaking tend to fall on the right side  freedom of speech equality issues churchstate separation quality public science education etc. Again thats from my point of view I dunno maybe you think creationism should be in science classrooms in which case weve got a whole bunch more to argue about but otherwise its basically fine. Simplistic maybe but fine.gt See thats a purely fluff argument based on your personal identity politics. Care to churn out a few more? Im sorry you feel that way. Briefly what I meant was that The God Delusion actively anticipates objections responds to them as patiently and systematically as possible acknowledges its limitations etc. The Bible does not do that just as a matter of plain fact. So its the specific content thats the difference and thats why I cant buy into this idea that atheismtheism are somehow equivalent. Its the actual content and nature of the claimsarguments that are different. I think its related to the comment by Noah that atheists worship Hitchens  it seems like some believers can not see a point of view outside of their framework of faith and worship. So they assume that atheists somehow do the same thing just with different flags  science instead of religion Hitchens instead of a god. But its just not true. Its perfectly possible to simply reject ideas like faith and worship entirely. Ive never been religious so its completely normal to me. To some though it seems so alien they cant even accept its possible.,badphilosophy,cpxmsb9,-2,t5_2sa6z

3790923,0,t1_cqodjwf,But we still have the problem of determining who switches.Say you have a room with a partition in the middle. In the left half of the room we have AlphaL and a beta. I was going to refer to him as BetaL but betas are indistinguishable so theres no need to name them. In the right half of the room we have AlphaR and a beta. Now we remove the partition leaving a single room with four men  one alpha and three betas. But who is the alpha? Is it AlphaL or AlphaR?If the choice is not random then there must be some characteristic of alphas that allows us to determine who will remain alpha and who will become beta when they are placed together in a room. I have been calling this property alphaness but in deference to you I will rename it metaalphaness. If metaalphaness is totally ordered then my above comments still apply under the new name.Now if you are correct that only one man can be alpha in any given room then it follows that metaalphaness is totally ordered. To construct the ordering place N men in a room. Determine who is the alpha and remove him from the room. If you are uncertain simply introduce a beautiful woman to the room  the first man to fuck her is by definition the alpha. Repeat this process until all men have been removed. This gives you a deterministic total ordering of metaalphaness.,badphilosophy,cqoe96j,1,t5_2sa6z

I once received a letter from an eminent logician Mrs. Christine LaddFranklin saying that she was a solipsist and was surprised that there were no others. Coming from a logician and a solipsist her surprise surprised me. We define solipsism to mean that theres only one mind in the world my mind. It takes a proper Wittgenstein to follow through with the understanding that when I say the world I mean my world.

5556720,0,t1_cwlq1lq,gt You dont have to be confrontational. We can actually have a conversation.My anscestors were from PortRoyal. Im not looking for a conversation Im looking to make conversions.gtIt is this use of the word science almost as an invocation of a divine name with the expectation that just uttering it will shatter all opposition.You might have missed out by the language barrier that that is nothing new and actually began with Scholasticism. Scientia in Latin simply means knowledge or academic discipline and was widely used as the highest value of all learning in the Christian nations during the Middle Ages. Of course smarter people like Aquinas were able to affirm it only with the caveat that Metaphysics remain the queen of the sciences but alas the ship was already leaking and now it seems to have sunk. The only way to convince people of that distinction being artificial now is to actually bring up with constitutes science knowledge and evidence. Im not convinced a direct appeal to Wisdom will work simply because weve reached precisely a place where nobody knows how to recognize it. Hegel tried to restore Wisdom as the ultimate form of knowledge and philosophy of finding it but it ended with a vogue of drawing prestige by calling everything Wisdom when a lot of it obviously wasnt.gtDawkinsDawkins is easy. Just keep pointing out he hasnt been in the lab in years and even a Badphilosopher the likes of E.O. Wilson has criticized him for not being in a lab in decades. gtIts why people have this weird heroworship of Neil deGrasse Tyson. Most of what hes admired for isnt even science but category errors that originate in overapplying or overvulgarizing science.gtI mean there are hints of it in Enlightenment thought but not totally divoreced from the use of reason like this.What you need to do is look up the use of Newton and Darwin in crappy European Letters. Its definitely happened before. I think its mostly a defense mechanism. And like I said it is different this time for the fact that a lot of this is postEmpirical anyways so really does come down to a question of established authority PR and identity politics.gtIn any event if I base an argument on a wellestablished premise from a very respected moral philosopher that doesnt make it bad philosophy.Look at the title thats not a wellestablished premise thats an overreaching characterization of his point to where it almost makes MacIntyre Messianic. And your list of virtues werent from MacIntyre who insists upon multiple systems for talking about the virtues he actively suggests of pluralism of people like Henry James Jane Austen Confucius and Benjamin Franklins ideas of the virtues if its ever going to be seriously discussed again.gtdefining for a whole culture what it means to be a good person.I really dont think the primary orientation this culture has is one of certain practiced virtues leading people to become better and thats deeply the problem. Theres no expectation of longterm virtue whatsoever and outside of moral philosophy a lot of shallowbreathing attacks on everyone elses ethics instead. ,badphilosophy,cwlv1sp,2,t5_2sa6z

Confronted with their nonsense the only thing an academic can do is point out how they are wrong and stop talking with them when it becomes evident that they have no intention of listening. A debate presupposes two at least remotely similarly sophisticated and defensible positions. There can be no debate between a geologist and the guy asserting igneous rocks are bullshit. The latter can listen and learn or they can stop wasting our time but its absurd to even contemplate that there can be a legitimate debate between us. Your views are not tennable and even if we reconstruct them in order to make them tennable that is if we do your work they will remain fairly unnuanced.  Thats just all there is to this. No amount of shouting and stomping your feet down will make us take you seriously because you are simply incapable of advancing any argument worth taking seriously and thats fully and exhaustively on you on your intellectual laziness. You could read a book but you choose not to. You could ask for recommendations in any of the academic subreddits you could ask for help understanding the material there too. But you choose not to. Thats all well and good but you can not in turn expect us to think highly of you.I mean just take a step back and look at what youre talking about. You plural have had no contact with any textbook or relevant educational material of some minimum quality let alone having approached any primary sources you literally know nothing at all about these fields beyond what you could gather from horribly biased youtube videos made by completely unqualified entertainers that themselves know nothing about these fields. You dont even know what they are called. You certainly cant even begin to imagine what the academic debates are about. You think you will what? Youll go up to an educator and have them answer to your halfformed fantasies about what the field they specialize in is supposed to be about? The potatoes have committed mutiny and theyre trying to beat up the greengrocer.What you very audaciously call indoctrination is nothing more than education in a field that is completely alien to you. In fact your clique doesnt even rise to the heights of disagreeing that any particular theory is right or wrong. You revolt against the very idea of coming to an understanding about what the theory is stating about what is claimed in the first place. Sargon doesnt level material criticisms against these courses. Sargon and people like Sargon make trivially false claims about what is being claimed and then throw tantrums when people try to correct them. Now this is precisely perpetuating misinformation.What you are doing is exactly equivalent to what young earth creationists are doing. You stomp your feet and demand a debate that can not be had supposing that the noise you make coupled with your selfassuredness somehow translates into a tennable position that people who know what they are talking about and are not very much unlike you peddling fantasies are obliged to humour. But they are not and they wont. The universities will continue ignoring you just like they are still ignoring YECs. Edit I hear its customary to make a thanks for the gold edit when your comments get gilded. Thanks!,badphilosophy,d2do6tn,106,t5_2sa6z
7351281,0,t1_d2dkikm,Sargon is spreading misinformation and creating a boogieman called SJW.I guess boogieman entails something that isnt real. Thats just not the case the vitriol is against a movement that regularly asserts points as mild as all white people are inherently racist and everything is misogynistic to whiteness is terrorism and men ought to be assumed guilty when accused of rape. These real and specific people and groups are where Sargon usually sends his criticism. Perhaps you are coming from a different place but these things strongly discomfort me and many others as much as those genuine racists antisemites and sexists. I think cases like these ought to be met with as much criticism as cases anything alike. You address that these people do exist but that Sargon is attacking a boogeyman he very specifically attacks these people who are as of recent very loud and growing in swathes.I dont use the term SJW generally it feels off to me too. The issue and as far as Ive seen Sargon feels similarly isnt that theyre trying to institute a matriarchy or obviously actually kill all men despite what many of them say but rather theyre pushing to implement policies as justice which treat men and white people as a blanket class and affect those vulnerable.There is a patriarchy in that sense that our society is traditionally rooted in masculinity. The problem and the reason its being attacked is that its very regularly used to shut down any discussion of mens problems and justify attacking them by sweeping assertions about genders and their experiences. Similarly on the white supremacy side.Many of these ideas namely the extreme ones about gender and race retribution are coming from academia and used as justification. Many of them too are taught in genderqueersocial justice studies courses in universities. I would certainly be keen however to see Sargon go through different universities course syllabi to collect all such instances. The fact that its even happening in a handful of places is troubling and ought to be addressed at least like this.Obviously the liberation of women and black people needs to be taught the history of the struggle preserved but thats a very far cry from whats being griped about I hope its clarified. Namely a substantial chunk of it is coming from and growing in universities.What exactly do you see here as misinformation?I appreciate your canny response.,badphilosophy,d2dsgsq,-25,t5_2sa6z

7494692,0,t1_d2tm1gt,My response is sort of. If I can mooch off Rorty again he holds a lot of sway over me obviously theres certainly nothing wrong with the pursuit of truth which I certainly actively engage in.My problem is that when people really seem to believe theyve found the Truth their first step is to try and impose it on other people. Im all for a dialogue but Ive read enough history to recognize most Truth as dogma largely dependent on historical contingencies which seems to me to defeat the purpose.I would distinguish the above as personal theorizing which I think is very important albeit a little quixotic. But when people try to force rather than communicate their Truth on the public based on my historical study very little good has come out of it. And something about what I understand the Truth to be implies forcing it on people is a very reasonable step to take which is why I sound against it generally. Thats what I mean by pop metaphysics and maybe what you mean by not a moron.Im very Feyerabendian  in my scientific outlook with caveats the reason this stuff gets me so riled up is that I very much believe its an authentic danger to our sense of individuality and pluralistic democracy both of which I think are already suffering. But these are very sensitive questions for me and they raise a lot of problems I havent been able to answer. So its not like Im set in stone or anything.Anyway if I ever come off as whinging about metaphysics thats really what I mean by it its just sort of my byword for forcing other people to believe what you think is true which is probably super unfair but Ive seen it used that way before and I lack a better word.,badphilosophy,d2u3uoi,1,t5_2sa6z

So maybe question your assumption of exploitation and get back to me.This is besides the point as when the sweatshops go away they go away without changing the fundamental relations of production. This is the assumption you never question even after not reading my previous comment  gt Obviously the only two choices are gt . Capitalism with sweatshops.gt . Capitalism without sweatshops.Let me spell it out. What everyone here is advocating is not  or  but   no capitalism and no sweatshops.gtCapitalism would be just as happy and work just as well if those children could have Western standards of living. Their poverty is a brute fact not an effect of capitalism.Capitalists would not be as happy because they need extremely cheap labor to lower the cost of production and they couldnt get it if these people had other options.gt If there was a better life they could be leading that capitalism was preventing them from that would be exploitation.We have a pretty easy modus ponens here.. If there was a better life they could lead that capitalism was preventing them from that would be exploitation. Granted. There is a better life they could lead that capitalism is preventing them from. Contentious. Therefore it is exploitation. MP is seemingly where we disagree. Lets see what is your support for its negation. Your point is that when sweatshops were removed these people were worse off. But since global capitalism was still in place this offers no support at all for the negation of . It only proves that within a capitalist system they are better off with sweatshops than without. I concede this fully but again this is absolutely no support for  and no argument against what people are arguing for here which is the removal of sweatshops as a consequence of the end of capitalism.Now what is my support for ? Obviously it is very speculative to know how material conditions would improve if capitalism ended but if workers had a fair share of an organisations revenue and could democratically manage this organisation as opposed to what they have right now they would be better off. As I said this is speculative as hell and no one here would be comfortable providing details that would depend on what we are transitioning to and how.What is easy to demonstrate is how capitalist and imperialistic economic policies are actively preventing these people from bettering their lives as this is a matter of empirical fact. That their poverty is a brute fact and not an effect of capitalism is simply false.It is no brute fact that Western firms have to go to these poor countries create and enforce free trade zones basically zones of total laissezfaire capitalism with no customs no labor laws etc. force local puppet governments on threat of coups to comply with exploitative economic policy at the expense of their people to have their state pay for the factory and their military act as private henchmen that execute wouldbe union leaders and quell potential revolt in factories. This is all true of Indonesia for instance. These are pretty fucking deliberate actions that keep these workers totally subjugated and exploited and these actions would not occur without capitalism and Western imperialistic economic policy. This misery is not a brute fact but the product of alterable social arrangement. It is not natural at all it takes incredible violence to maintain.If you think these are natural brute facts of unseen market forces with no intention on the part of anyone to keep these people as disposable wageslaves you clearly dont know much about the history of US intervention in South America or Indonesia for example. Its pure ideology or simply naivet to think the US stays on top because of abstract market forces and a better GDP. They simply have more military diplomatic and intelligence resources to further their interests and they have no qualms about using this advantage to stay on top by any means necessary.As long as the US is capitalistic and their elected officials are bought and paid for by big firms national interest will always be foreign policy newspeak for whatever increases the profit margins of big firms. Since higher profits require the cheapest possible labor and since the livelihood of capitalists depends on it you can bet your ass that they will not leave the availability of cheap labor to chance especially when they have the means to secure it. They support exploitative regimes assassinate foreign activists and back counterrevolutions whenever the peoples desire for autonomy threatens their profit margins. That is a historical fact.  ,badphilosophy,d46a3cy,9,t5_2sa6z

Then you hear that its not scientifically valid or reliable so you look into it and you notice that there hasnt been any research on the cognitive functions. You convince yourself that the cognitive functions have a nonempirical backing and are somehow a fundamental metaphysical state of personality and all it takes is studying them to understand.Youll spend  years reading up on it creating giant charts and weird syllogisms to justify it and then youll give up because youll realize none of it makes sense. Youll try not to youll make a bunch of threads on some of your favorite forums and subreddits talk to the people on PersonalityCafe who claim to be experts ask them to explain the epistemic justification.And then youll get told universally across the board that it just requires some faith that this is how the mind words even if well never find anything justifying it rationally or empirically and youll realize that all those essays and charts and everything you wrote was a waste of your time and God help you if you spent any money on this.Its a scam get out now. I was lucky I realized it as a teenager before I had the power and legal agency to let it take over my life.,badphilosophy,d9e68y9,20,t5_2sa6z

Selectively denying that right to people based upon their race is racist and it is deplorable.

He seemed set on proving his already established views and wouldnt consider all the faults to his arguments may have been addressed by Nozick whom I have not read. His counterargument for slavery basically amounted to an assertion that controlownership but its clear if you take his argument seriously it means that I drive my friends car I then own it since I am controlling it.I think Propertarian Anarchism can be a valid position but those who subscribe to the NAP based on self ownership typically struggle to ground it.

9701411,0,t1_da8vqxm,gt No because the definition of evidence would be different.That is the entire point yes. The parenthetical makes it almost vacuously true  the issue is whether  with the parenthetical and  without it are the same which is what its been since the start.gtThats a strange thing to assert. Is sense data not real?I mean Im not sure Id classify it as a thing rather than saying it isnt real. Now Im not actually calling existence a predicate though well it is as Kant agreed its just not a real predicate but Im not the one stacking the deck here youre attempting to equivocate between the sensation of x and x itself. That is to say for the idealist we have experiences of the sense data of trees and not actual experiences of trees. Sure they might be one and the same. But youre just moving freely between the two which isnt alright unless you maintain that trees are merely perceptual.gtThis is where analytic ontology really falls apart. X exists is held to be a metaphysical claim but really its uninteresting.I mean thats not a falling apart. Similarly x exists is often a physical claim and is often itself uninteresting. That doesnt impugn the fact its a physical claim in any sense its just not an interesting one its just a bizarre thing to claim that this shows a flaw. For example trees exist is a  metaphysical claim. Its also a physical claim trees are physical. But we both agree here that trees arent the proper thing for physics to study. Yes of course its still a physical claim and physics can study trees. But we all agree here that this is just a poor research practice for physics. Similarly its a poor research practice for metaphysics to get bogged down into studying trees. But this doesnt mean trees exist isnt a metaphysical claim. It is. But the issue here is that x exists can be a claim of some type without being an object of study for the field concerning that type as a whole. Like. Trees exist is also a chemical claim too since trees are made out of chemicals. But we relegate discussion of trees to biology.Im just not seeing how this can in any way impugn analytic metaphysics this is all standard stuff in research projects you dont try and cover everything in one go you break it up into domains of specialization etc.  again it seems like you think of metaphysics in a radically different way than I.gtYoure being shortsighted and assuming that materialism and antimaterialism are exhaustive positions on the subject.No Im distinctly not doing that.gtI dont see a dialectic throughout history between materialists and anti materialists I see something that resembles one if you dont look closelyI agree with you that physical cant be coherently defined though not so sure about cause. Thats not the issue. Im denying that this dialectic even exists and saying that because physical is largely meaningless while theyre talking as if theyre materialists and anti materialists theyre really arguing over something else.,badphilosophy,da8wms2,1,t5_2sa6z

Would you consider yourself guilty of any number of crimes potentially up to treason and covering up a child sex ring because you voted for her?Is it somehow controversial that you have some responsibility for things youre a part of? I mean excluding normative ethical theories that dont take responsibility into account the answer to this is kinda just...yes?And thengt So youre arguing that all Hillary voters should go to jail for pedophilia?Bold choice Cotton.Okay so the typical thought experiment thats given for this If you and four others shoot a child are you responsible to any extent for the death of that child or are none of you responsible? I mean had any of you not done it surely it still wouldve happened because four others would shoot the child and the child would die anyway.The fact that you havent changed anything in terms of consequences doesnt somehow mean you can do whatever you want and you dont objectively hold any responsibility for this. Like what the hell is this guy even trying to say here?And then the idea that any level of responsibility means a full sentence? Fucking what? Nobodys arguing that if you give a taxi ride to a thief that you deserve to get imprisoned for stealing. Obviously since you knew theyre a thief and you had the choice to help them or not help them get to their destination you are somewhat responsible but being as responsible as them for stealing in the eyes of the law is not a state of affairs anyone is fighting for.gt How long has this hippy meat is murder shit been around?  years generously?

10966690,0,t3_5whqrh,Few human creatures would consent to be changed into any of the lower animals for a promise of the fullest allowance of a beasts pleasures no intelligent human being would consent to be a fool no instructed person would be an ignoramus no person of feeling and conscience would be selfish and base even though they should be persuaded that the fool the dunce or the rascal is better satisfied with his lot than they are with theirs. They would not resign what they possess more than he for the most complete satisfaction of all the desires which they have in common with him. If they ever fancy they would it is only in cases of unhappiness so extreme that to escape from it they would exchange their lot for almost any other however undesirable in their own eyes. A being of higher faculties requires more to make him happy is capable probably of more acute suffering and certainly accessible to it at more points than one of an inferior type but in spite of these liabilities he can never really wish to sink into what he feels to be a lower grade of existence.,badphilosophy,deb4xml,5,t5_2sa6z

Did you come out of the womb with your ethical viewpoint? Was it inherent in your genetic makeup? Your ethical capacity is on going and it will never not be.gtthe viability of constructing an argumentNothing I said alluded to constructing an argument. Ive been talking about seeing value in something you did not before. Which is to say that you see what its worth.I guarantee you there have been racist men in history who met certain men of the other race and realized that the position they held prior was foolish. Obviously this is worlds apart from the ice cream analogy in terms of degree of importance but not really in terms of the aspect of seeing. A person sees a certain thing as having no value strawberry ice cream people of another race and they are shown that they were wrong about this.
