4035262,0,t3_36qvmq,Open letter from South Africa  release the report into the Marikana massacreAn open letter from activists asking why the results of the inquiry into the massacre have not yet been made publicTo His Excellency President Jacob ZumaShortly after the Marikana massacre when the nation was still reeling from the gunning down of  striking platinum miners by South African Police you told us We have to uncover the truth about what happened here.In this regard Ive decided to institute a commission of inquiry. The inquiry will enable us to get to the real cause of the incident.You also told us that In a very short space of time we will announce the results.It has now been one month since you received the findings of the Farlam Commission of Inquiry into the deaths of those young men.You must president Jacob Zuma be painfully aware that the families of those who died have had to wait patiently for two years and eight months for some kind of explanation. Many attended the commission day in day out listening to various parties give evidence hoping that all of this time money and effort will lead to a just outcome.But what would a just outcome look like? Firstly it would have to involve the truth as much of it as possible however painful.The families deserve to know why their loved ones were gunned down by police using R rifles.They deserve to know what discussions were had by police by mining company Lonmin and by your cabinet in the runup to the massacre.They deserve to know what preparations were made for the th why mortuary vans were ordered on the morning before the attack and why paramedics were prevented from assisting those injured in the crucial hour after the shooting took place.They deserve to know what is going to happen next. Who is going to be held accountable?QuestionsWe do not know if the answers to these important questions are to be found in the final report of the Farlam Commission.We know that you set about to establish the commission not just to restore calm at the time but because you wanted to get to the truth. How else could you justify such a lengthy and expensive process?But there is something else at stake here. In the aftermath of the massacre there was a collective weeping for our democracy. Nobody would expect that the might of the state would be brought down on a group of low paid workers under an African National Congress government.In a constitutional democracy it is not a crime to go on strike or to demand a meeting with ones employer.Some notable people have even said that what happened at Marikana was worse than massacres like Sharpeville because it was planned.Whatever one believes Marikana will live with us as the greatest blight on our democracy to date. After the massacre you told people that Today is not an occasion for blame fingerpointing or recrimination.With the completion of the Farlam Commission Report surely that day has come?We therefore appeal to you to make the unedited Farlam Commission Report immediately available.If you are not able to do this we request an explanation for why you are not willing to give the public full access to these findings.Rehad Desai Noor Nieftagodien Patrick Bond Trevor Ngwane Ronnie Kasrils Mark Heywood Zwelinzima Vavi Peter Alexander Jacklyn Cock Thea de Wet Farid Esack Leo Zeilig Fred Hendricks Dale McKinley Jane Duncan,Socialist,crg90px,1,t5_2qubn
5018865,0,t1_cuqygpa,Craven Liberalism the Real Cancer in OccupyHedges declares that any forceful resistance is a gift from heaven to the security and surveillance state while at the same time claiming that Occupy encampments in various cities were shut down precisely because they were nonviolent www.truthdig.com  February . In fact the appropriate tactics in any given situation depend on a host of concrete circumstances. There are many times when the balance of forces precludes the use of physical force by protesters and there are also situations where such attempts would be politically unwise. But those who refuse to distinguish between the violence of the oppressors and that of their victims however tactically inadvisable are incapable of playing any useful role in the struggle against the multiple and manifest injustices of the decaying capitalist social order.Hedges expresses a generalized opposition to political differentiation within the Occupy movementparticularly if it comes from his left. He is offended that some proponents of the Black Bloc dare characterize Noam Chomsky Americas leading radical liberal as a sellout. Chomsky has done a great deal of useful analysis and exposed many imperialist crimes but he is also a cardcarrying member of the procapitalist Democratic Socialists of America and advised people to vote for Obama in . He can hardly be considered any sort of revolutionary.Hedges also complained about an article published in Green Anarchy that criticized the Mexican ZapatistasThe essay declared that not only are those the Zapatistas aims not anarchist they are not even revolutionary. It also denounced the indigenous movement for nationalist language for asserting the right of people to alter or modify their form of government and for having the goals of work land housing health care education independence freedom democracy justice and peace. The movement the article stated was not worthy of support because it called for nothing concrete that could not be provided by capitalism.Ibid.The Zapatistas do not even profess to be revolutionary but Marxists solidarize with them against repression by the Mexican state just as we defend Black Bloc participantsmany of whom it should be noted are radical liberals with plenty of illusions in Chomsky and the Zapatistas.It is at least a little hypocritical for Hedges who is so fiercely opposed to the Black Bloc to object to them criticizing others. But it is common for reformists to advocate the exclusion or suppression of those to their left. As Graeber observed Hedgess cancer polemic has an unpleasant political logicEven if you did not intend this statement as a call to violence which I suspect you did not how can you honestly believe that many will not read it as such?In my experience when I point this sort of thing out the first reaction I normally get from pacifists is along the lines of what are you talking about? Of course Im not in favor of attacking anyone! I am nonviolent! I am merely calling for nonviolently confronting such elements and excluding them from the group! The problem is that in practice this is almost never what actually happens. Time after time what it has actually meant in practice is either a turning fellow activists over to the police i.e. turning them over to people with weapons who will physically assault shackle and imprison them or b actual physical activistonactivist assault. Such things have happened.,Socialist,cuqyq1h,1,t5_2qubn
5761349,0,t3_3u2a00,Much of Syria has already been destroyed by the U.S.fueled civil war aimed at toppling the Assad government. The only way out of this morass the only way to overcome ethnic and religious hostilities dating back to the collapse of the decrepit Ottoman Empire in World War I the only way to achieve selfdetermination for the Kurdish nation and defend all the endangered minorities is through a proletarianled offensive to drive imperialism from the region and defeat all the warring Zionist Islamist militarist and communalist regimes and forces. That requires an internationalist communist leadership on a Trotskyist program of permanent revolution fighting for a socialist federation of the Middle East.The bulk of the Western left however has once again lined up with their imperialist masters. A year ago many were calling on NATO to arm the Kurds against the Islamic fascists of the I.S. This time around they are denouncing Russian intervention in Syria. The most blatant case is that of the heirs of Tony Cliff the renegade from Trotskyism who broke from the Fourth International pinning the label state capitalist on the Soviet bureaucratically degenerated workers state and refusing to defend it during the Cold War from Korea on. After decades of denouncing Soviet imperialism the Cliffites have seamlessly gone over to vituperating against Russian imperialism from Ukraine to Syria.Thus Alex Callinicos the guru of the British Socialist Workers Party SWP called Syria a battlefield of imperialist rivalry arguing that contrary to part of the left that perceives only the West as imperialism .... Russia too is an imperialist power Socialist Worker UK  October. The International Socialist Organization ISO in the U.S. likewise argues that Syria is Caught in the web of imperialist rivalries and seeks to revive the Cliffite slogan Neither Washington nor Moscow Socialist Worker U.S.  and  October. While Cliff amp Co. claimed to represent a third camp in the antiSoviet Cold War in reality their supposed neutrality was just a left cover for supporting the first camp of Western imperialism. We see this again today.Although claiming to oppose U.S. imperial aims the ISO repeats Syrian rebel complaints that promised military aid from U.S. and European governments has never included the kind of heavy weapons like antiaircraft batteries that would help them confront the Syrian military and now Russian warplanes. While the American Cliffites still affect a pretense of independence from imperialism  just quoting the rebels they support asking for Western arms as they did in the NATO assault on Libya  their main analysis of Russias Syrian intervention is by Gilbert Achcar who in  pilloried those opposed to the U.N. no fly zone in Libya and explicitly demanded arms should be delivered openly and massively to the insurgents ZNet  March .Today this appeal for imperialist aid is raised by one Joseph Daher who writes We must also support the delivery of arms and weapons with no political conditions attached from the West to democratic sections of the FSA and of the Kurdish forces to fight and struggle against the Assad regime and Islamic fundamentalist forces Syria Freedom Forever  October. Daher who grew up in Geneva Switzerland and is now at the University of Lausanne is often quoted in a range of leftist publications as the voice of the nonexistent Syrian Revolution just as Achcar who has for decades been a professor in Paris Berlin and now at the University of London is the goto Marxist authority on the Middle East for various pseudoTrotskyists.Whether themselves appealing directly to the Western militarists like Daher and Achcar or using a cutout of supporting the Islamists who appeal for U.S.NATO support all of these fakers are left apologists for imperialism. Rather than fighting to defeat the wouldbe masters of the world the ISO SWP and the rest of the socialdemocratic crowd want a more peoplefriendly imperialism. From Libya to Syria the pseudosocialists and imperialist governments back the same insurgent forces supposedly fighting for democracy against dictators. And today the opportunist leftists line up with the most bellicose imperialists on Syria.In France the Nouvel Parti Anticapitaliste NPA publishes Dahers denunciation of Russian imperialism and appeal for NATO imperialist arms against Assad LAnticapitaliste  October even as Socialist president Franois Hollande launches French airstrikes against the Daesh Arabic acronym for the Islamic State in Syria while demanding that Assad must go. The NPA is led by the political heirs of Ernest Mandel who are part of what poses as the International formerly United Secretariat of the Fourth International. But over time Cliffites and Mandelites grew closer as the latter abandoned any pretense of defending the Soviet Union a pillar of authentic Trotskyism and both hailed the counterrevolution that destroyed the USSR.For the followers of the antiTrotskyst Tony Cliff support for reactionary Islamist forces goes back decades. They hailed Khomeinis  Islamic revolution in Iran that butchered tens of thousands of leftists women homosexuals and Kurds while authentic Trotskyists opposed the mullah regime in the s Cliff amp Co. praised the Afghan mujahedin fighting Soviet troops in Afghanistan  while the thenTrotskyist Spartacist tendency hailed the Soviet intervention for years the British SWP met with Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt. Rejecting Trotskys theory of permanent revolution and the need for a proletarian vanguard they made common cause with whatever bourgeois movement was popular at the time.If proimperialist social democrats like the ISO routinely peddled Western lies about Syria  such as the fabrication that the Damascus regime used chemical weapons on its own people when everything points to the Islamist gangs and their Saudi and Turkish backers as authors of that attack hoping to trigger U.S. bombing of Syria  various Stalinist and protoStalinist tendencies call to back the authoritarian Assad regime. This also is nothing new as they have for decades regularly given political support to nationalist strongmen in semicolonial countries. In the U.S. the Workers World Party WWP and Party of Socialism and Liberation PSL have made this their trademark.Both WWP and PSL are heirs of Sam Marcy who split from the thenTrotskyist Socialist Workers Party in the early s supporting the MaoStalinist regime in China. Both sing hosannas to the Kim dynasty in North Korea one really deformed workers state. WWP leader Sara Flounders penned an article upholding Syrias right to defend its sovereignty and arguing that Because of its independent economic and political policies and because of its decades of support for the Palestinian struggle Syria was on the hit list slated for U.S. conquest since the George W. Bush administration Workers World  October. While the U.S. has certainly gone after Syria this is a onesided portrayal of the Assad regimes relation to imperialism.Actually under Bush II Syria cooperated closely with the U.S. at the outset of the Global War on Terror. Washington sent many suspects to be tortured in Syria under the extraordinary rendition program. The  U.S. invasion of Iraq that ousted Saddam Hussein  whose militarybased regime like Assads in Syria was derived from the Arab nationalist Baath Renewal party  put an end to that. Assad exported local Sunni Islamist fighters to harass the U.S. occupation and jailed them when they returned to Syria. Today he would renew the antiterrorist collaboration with imperialism offering his services as a bulwark of stability in the region keeping Israels northern border quiet while talking resistance if only the U.S. would allow it.  cont. below ,Socialist,cxb8yx7,1,t5_2qubn
