And thats why we need at least successor IPs free of Konami not just what KojiPro is doing but what Igarashis doing with Bloodstained and I am hoping Sony gets the documents from Silent Hills to make a western Siren reboot with Kojima and Del Toro as executive producers.,kojimapro,cyxhgqa,1,t5_3bcy8

8914149,0,t1_d7jb4xn,Obviously a butt hurt response. I wasnt really attacking the game I was just pointing out how youre given a silenced pistol and all these other stealth mechanics in contrast to a requirement which forces you to be anything but stealthy running around deploying  balloons in the same FOB and shooting everyone in the head while the game at the same time encourages you to lurk in the shadows. Its just very counterintuitive and flies in the face of everything the series has always been about. I posted this question on  subreddits  hours ago and nobody has anything to say about it. Obviously Ive struck a cord with the wrong people. ,kojimapro,d7jcm2m,-3,t5_3bcy8
