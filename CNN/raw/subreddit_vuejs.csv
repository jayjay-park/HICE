7851982,0,t3_4mvhig,Im fairly new as well. It explains on the Vue.js guide on components.There is only one vue object so you can just use a literal object. Since there can be multiple components it is a bad idea to share a data object. Every time a component is created it calls the data function to get a new copy of that data. That way they are not mutating the same js object.,vuejs,d3ymsle,2,t5_38jhw

9377810,0,t1_d94i420,Assuming I understand what youre saying you can use any css class on any of your components html fine regardless if they are referenced in your vue files ltstylegt section.All that scope attribute does is attach an HTML attribute to the components root element and attaches that attribute to your css classes in the components ltstylegt section effectively scoping that css there but any other css class you have in your components html that is defined in some other css file will work fine.,vuejs,d94pchw,1,t5_38jhw

9427661,0,t1_d9b02yf,Ok thanks for pointing that out.   I generally understood the process except that I thought the state would persist in a way I didnt understand. Also just a note The page isnt refreshing on its own.  I refreshed it after changing the layout and was surprised to find it load without data. ,vuejs,d9b0rlc,1,t5_38jhw

10937376,0,t3_5w56mu,Take some time and learn single file components along with the multiple ways of transmitting information between them events event hubs vuex stores. Those are the most important and complex? things youll need to know.,vuejs,de843r0,2,t5_38jhw
10967830,0,t3_5wmj09,Typically you would be generating a list of ltligts like this    ltli vforitem of itemsgt      ltbutton disabledisAddeditem.idgtAdd Meltbuttongt    ltligtIf this is a oneof item then the code you have looks good to me.This is hard to answer without more information about the structure of your data and template. For example Im not sure why you have dataidst hardcoded in your template was this generated from the server or something?.,vuejs,deb95sn,1,t5_38jhw
11201641,0,t1_df1k4mt,afaik It was not right now.You might want to check your vuecli version. Currently latest version of webpack template doesnt have any vueresource option. Not sure of browserify or simple version.,vuejs,df1owxg,1,t5_38jhw

11504849,0,t3_647r6z,It would bundle lodash in both components unless you configured otherwise in the commonChunksPlugin settings. You can also set a minChunks to automatically extract things that have been imported X times. Im still a novice at webpack but have had success cherry picking only the lodash functions I need in a specific component. I would experiment and see what works best for each situation ,vuejs,dg02prv,3,t5_38jhw
11669606,0,t1_dgilpbo,Thats how I would do it to a child component from a parent. But can I do it from the html to the parent or sole component?,vuejs,dgirkl8,1,t5_38jhw
11749861,0,t3_67hfvk,gt For the gods of javascripts sake why would I download  MB for build  static pages?Why would you use Vue or anything similar for a  page static site?

11766343,0,t1_dgtqc0x,Thanks I didnt know this. Its not even listed in awesomevue.Frankly Im getting a bit frustrated by the Chinese dominance in Vue. Overall I do not find it positive for this reason Separated by the language the Chinese have created their own Vue island which is kind of out of reach when it comes to the western developers.It looks like they do not mind to be isolated too. They have so much traction and human resource look at all those Chinese github stars that it feels like they dont need extra hands from outside of their island.I hate the complexity of React amp co but at least I see projects attached to familiar faces and language in React. I may have to reconsider continuing with Vue due to lack of a mature UI library developed in the west.,vuejs,dgtquam,2,t5_38jhw
