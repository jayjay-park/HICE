I think it was pretty  but I also know I was driving way more defensively than normal to attempt to account for my horrid lack of speed in this annoying vehicle.

3521470,0,t3_30le55,Team Nyan Cat updates Sven started strong with a double stint with a gap to nd of about half a lap. I dont know exactly what happened since I hopped on most of the way though the nd  stint but great job Sven! I hopped in for the rd stint. Disaster struck at the end of pit road when I realized I didnt have a pit limiter button set. After panicking and getting towed I set the stupid button and waited an agonizing . minutes. Now in rd place I drove a fairly successful stint. I closed the gap to the leaders made an ugly pass light x for nd but was black flagged and gave it up. Conveniently they both pitted allowing me to finish the stint in the lead. Highly annoyed I tossed a minute worth of gap away that Sven worked so hard for but it was a fun stint. Jordan is driving his st th overall stint currently we are sitting in th. I think he is planning on doing  or  stints now and then according to the schedule Sven is back for his rd stint. Ill keep updating as the race goes on. Everyone is doing a great job so far knocking on all the wood and all weve had is off tracks knocking on more wood.  Keep it up team Nyan Cat! I hope Bacon does alright things look a bit glum from the stream right now but but the beauty of endurance racing is weve got  hours to make it up! Good luck everybody! Edit we had our first bobble with a small spin and LF suspension damage. After about  minutes in the pits were back out in th. Car is reportedly very drivable so its time to find some time. Edit  Jordan finished his second stint which I missed most of. Apparently he got sideswiped by some lap up Maclaren while entering the pits not his fault. I tuned back in about halfway through Svens final stint. He got us up to  from  or  I think and picked up some laps on other lap up cars. Upon coming in we had  of optional damage from Jordans second incident. Sven claimed the LF was ruined and the car was driving poorly but you really wouldnt know it just watching him make passes. Alex hopped in for his first two of three stints. The car is reportedly feeling good after the optional repairs and he has made some nice passes so far on lap up and down traffic. We had a very near miss with a self spin from the GTfusion RUF who have been driving sketchy the entire race. Luckily Alex missed them by inches and we escaped with only an off track. He is currently just over halfway through his first stint and has been turning out s with seriously impressive consistency. Further updates forthcoming. Edit  Alex finished his stint without any incidents and I hopped in for my double stint. Early in my first run I nabbed one position. The next was about s I think up the track and I made that my goal for my time in the car. I made up ground with a few scary moments and off tracks in the mix and my times dropped towards the end of the first stint. Fuel and repeat for most of my second stint. With a few laps to go and .x seconds to the next position I put a wheel on the grass exiting Le Mans and began a slow spin toward the inside wall. I would have hit it from the front which would be kind of ideal but a McLaren was right behind me and tried to go inside to get around which is where I was heading. He spun me around so the rear end slammed the wall and the engine took a hard hit. I cant blame him since I spun though so whatever. I limped back to the pits trailing tons of smoke. Every  feet the car tried to lunge toward the wall. In for  required  optional. Shit. Alex hops in and waits the required damage out. He takes it out for a lap but the car is badly down on power and were back in the pits for the optional stuff this time. He comes out th from th and almost th before my incident. The car is still definitely down on power but we shouldnt lose anymore positions in the last  minutes. Unfortunately in the penultimate corner Alex spun and put the right side of the car squarely but gently into the outside wall. Conveniently it was before the pits and we were able to come back easily. Were now waiting out the last  minutes or so of the  I think and we should finish the race rolling in th position as the next car is  laps back. Edit  We just finished the race in th place and happy to be rolling. Well done to all the team members everyone did well. Very satisfied with my first teamendurance race super fun stuff!How did things end over at Team Bacon?,RiL,cpto90n,5,t5_2ynkh
