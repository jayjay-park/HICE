5038284,0,t1_cutakyl,gt There is small error a bit annoying but easy fix if you go to account without login you get alerts and alerts and alerts and alerts.I know. Sorry about that. gtgt I promise there will be a propper way for entering API keys in the future. Ill just fix that soon tho.gt Third in pvp is possible to create a collumn for matchs that count for the class title?I could only do that in the latest matches section since the API doesnt return anything else for the overview part. I am thinking about just parsing every match as they happen but I wanna see if there is interest in that in the first place.,gw2efficiency,cutaz3l,2,t5_37tvj
