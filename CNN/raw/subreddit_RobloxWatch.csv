8832257,0,t3_506zqa,Once again Dayren demonstrates the unforgiving cruelty of his ironifistlike reign over hundreds of hard working developers. This event is only one of several other instances where Dayren has insensitively and callously flicked the life away of a working class ROBLOXian. Just last week dayren scoffed at the death of a construction laborer who was fatally struck by a shard of burning metal following the derailment of car  one of many accidents at the Korean Space Program themed amusement park. Officials have yet to release personal information regarding the worker whose body was nearly obliterated after being mutilated by a kg wedge of incandescent metal traveling at nearly kph. A statement given by the mans family was released however but park officials failed to give a translation to the entirelyKorean woes of the workers mother and father.gt    .                       .,RobloxWatch,d79ihxl,4,t5_3c4yj
