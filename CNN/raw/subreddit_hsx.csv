Box Office mStrike price Profit . per shareIn this case it is      .  .The profit will shrink closer to the date of cash out as more people buy into the warrant.If a blockbuster never exceeds its strike price i.e. m for Minions then it will delist at  and you lose your money.In this case Minions has exceeded it so it will be profitable. How profitable it is depends on when exactly you buy it. The best time is when the warrants IPO at  dollars per share.In theory it is possible to lose money on a warrant if you buy too high and it delists at a lower dollar amount based on the domestic gross.N.B. They only count weekend grosses and not ticket sales on weekdays when calculating the total domestic gross.Official description of BWs from the hsx.com sitegtBlockbuster Warrants are Hollywood Derivatives which allow traders the opportunity to invest in the longterm financial success of the biggest studio movies. Blockbuster Warrants are similar to Call Options except the strike price is set for  weekends of box office in wide release.gtIf this particular film makes the strike price by its th weekend of wide release then the warrant will cash out at the difference between the actual box office and the strike price. If the film does not hit the strike price then the warrant will cash out at zero.gtFor Example A M Blockbuster Warrant has a strike price of H. It will delist at zero if the movie does not make more than  million after  weekends. If the film makes more than  million then the Warrant will cash out at a price determined by the following formula Actual Box Office  Strike Price. If the film made  million then the Warrant would cash out at H.   .,hsx,cv7ewro,1,t5_2tzle

6178306,0,t1_cyrwluy,Fair enough Im just interested to hear other peoples thoughts on how they play sometimes. Everyone is different and has different times they can access their port. Not everyone can sit there all the time and day trade. Im up late for STAR ,hsx,cyrwqn8,2,t5_2tzle
6334602,0,t1_cz9d002,Nothing too fancy I account for commission in the formula so the expected and current values are shifted by  in the appropriate direction.  The main reason I started doing this back in the day was because when my port was smaller and I religiously stuck to the DROIgt rule I wanted to know if adjusts were worth it  or  days out when I was paying  commission on each trade.  e.g. A stock adjusting from H to H in two days has a DROI of  but costs you as much in commission to buy and sell it as you make anyway.  Another interesting point to note is that I quote DROI numbers for n days to adjust. At first this was mostly a mistake in my calculations but I leave it that way as a personal preference due to my timezone and trading habits. It gives me a range of DROI between the standard calc and this one.  That said the numbers are incredibly similar when the adjust is more than a week away and the variation widens as the adjust approaches. This highlights to me even more the big adjusts for a given week. ,hsx,cz9oate,1,t5_2tzle

8262577,0,t1_d5a8b1g,gt You should be able to justify your holdings at least qualitatively if not quantitatively.  In my fairly worthless opinion  I believe your two main principles are in reversed order.  I see a stocks value literally as its DROI first thus I would consider your first principle to be a less defined more gut feel version of your second principle. I do know what you mean though and it is good advice.  Of course it is difficult to assign an estimated DROI to every stock you purchase and then review that everyday to tweak your holdings. But based on the knowledge you have gained over time playing the game trial and error other players advice etc. You get to understand how the market reacts to certain things like news weekend forecasts Thursday numbers Friday numbers etc. and can learn how to assign an estimated DROI to things based on gut feel. I just think this qualitative approach should be secondary to a quantitative one if it is available to you.  Also in reference to the statement I have quoted. This is spot on. I would remind anyone playing this game that to excel at it you need to separate it from the movie industry that many of us are interested in and see the game as a game where any news about any film we never even plan to see could net us big bucks on any one day.  I have some thoughts on the hour per day style play that I will touch on later when I have time. I think its good to spell out a strategy which focuses on different things each day. ,hsx,d5adoqr,2,t5_2tzle

I cant see this one making anymore than a total of  in the next  weeks which translates to about H profit at the current H IPO.LBATM.BW is another story though that one has the potential to make some fairly good profits hard to tell how much but should clear H per share by the end of it.,hsx,dejxn8o,1,t5_2tzle
