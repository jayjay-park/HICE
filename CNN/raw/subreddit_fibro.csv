If you cant walk away from your desk then march in place next to it. Prolonged sitting can lead to blood clots. You can also do some stretches like quad stretches calf stretches back and shoulder stretches. A minute or two of movement can do a lot.Do squats they work a lot of muscles at once. Get some dumbbells to exercise your arms.,fibro,cucq4zi,1,t5_2sh48

7585381,0,t1_d34c85y,What Im trying to say is that people with fibro DO have to plan around things that are more stressful. Honestly it takes more energy to do a lot of simple things Id never even considered before. Im not saying she has it but stress in certain forms can absolutely wreck me. I have anxiety issues doing some really stupid simple things like calling on the phone. I have so many appointments I need to follow up with. It is so fucking easy to do and takes practically no time at all. But the stress of the whole thing drives me up a wall and I get shell shocked just thinking about it. A lot of these types of things I have to put on the back burner and gradually do them as I feel like Im ready for them.Its a really really confusing and complicated disorder. I dont even know what Im feeling half the time or know how much energy Im going to have any given day. Im just saying that to the outsider I look really healthy. I was able to try to go snowboarding last week! emphasis on try lmao. If you only took snapshots of what you see me doing in public you would think Im healthier than most people. And in order to get from actual slug on the couch that could barely walk to healthy and fit I had to cut away almost all of my stresses because many of them disproportionately took too much energy for me to accomplish. From what you describe I think shes probably taking advantage but I just want to give you an idea since you dont seem to understand how fibromyalgia worksfuck I dont really get it either tbh. The fatigue is the most damning part of it. EVERYTHING requires calculated energy and effort on an emotional physical and mental level. Rationality from an outsiders perspective isnt going to get you very far. ,fibro,d34f5om,1,t5_2sh48
