63404,0,t1_celmhwy,Actually Im the same when it comes to that Ive never used any of the higher end items if I get them. Doing birthdays and Christmas stockingsgifts were a breeze this year because I have been stashing away the bags though. The fuschia UD lipstick sample that Id never wear went to my makeup artist friend who was more than happy to take it off my hands. I have two MUA friends who work with me on my photography shoots so its my treat for them at the end of the year to spoil them as a thank you I pay them too P. I stuffed the ELF villain bags I got full of makeup from both indie companies and high end from Ipsy and from regular shopping.. both of them flipped out they loved it. Stockings this year was fun for the ladies in my family too because of Ipsy and Birchbox.I gift a lot of my subscription items so I end up using an item per bag if that. Instead trading it all on rbbexchange it takes care of the holidays for me. Its a good price for the crapshoot as long as they pay attention to the profile and change up the brands. If not its just annoying and not fun especially when the companies tout profiles as a tailored way to get items but in reality just ignore them. Gifting the samples are a good way to get rid of unwanted items but Id love to get stuff in my bag Ive actually specified that I want!,BeautyBoxes,celnch0,3,t5_2uctp

230735,0,t1_cf4khf7,The Vita Ampoule is technically honey though youre instructed to use it similarly to how the Goodal oil is applied. Same consistency same eye dropper dispensing. Close enough for me that I wont use both products at the same time. The Iope is referred to as sap essence and reminded me of OCM so I included it in my face oil statement. The Danahan is definitely a serum and yes the Cremolab is a toner. The only skin product Ive used so far is the Goodal and I really like it I didnt even have to bother with a foundation primer today. The bb cream goes on smoothly and has good coverage but the shade is too light for my skin tone so Ill use it as a highlighter. The Mini Mandarin Juice seems like a very good staining product but its way too orange for me. Id suggest using a sponge for blending instead of your finger as the directions tell you to. My finger is still orange.Edited to add What I should have said in my first comment is that I wish there was more diversity in the skincare products. A mask or exfoliator would have been nice.,BeautyBoxes,cf4nwg7,-1,t5_2uctp

The Pop Crayon that I have also match the POP Beauty and Ipsy site so no issues there.

You definitely dont need to use contour tooI have a VERY hard time with contouring but I love highlighting This is a simple highlight and contour diagram.  You can get way super fancy with it too like Kim Kardashian but I havent managed that level of skill yet   One of the biggest things with the mousse IMO is definitely blending!

I guess Ill look and see what you guys said about it last time but I know Nourish Organic has just never worked for me.  But other than that its a pretty good bag.

2859661,0,t3_2sku1h,I got my box in on Saturday while my boyfriend was visiting and I felt a bit weird opening it in front of him because honestly this box was very disappointing for me. If I tanned I would probably be so happy but I dont so the other items in the box are what would have to make me happy. The lip items seem alright I have a million primer samples. But its really those damn tattoos those are the worst to me. I find them so tacky. I can see how very young girls would like them but they definitely arent for me.Can you just sub to Boxycharm as you see the boxes? I would prefer to just get spoiled every month and then cancel my sub as I go than to be left with such disappointing boxes..,BeautyBoxes,cnt57uw,1,t5_2uctp

I also ordered some things from Popbasic recently so Ill do some posts on those later on also for some variety around here!I was waiting for the Phone Case of the Month to come out with iPhone  cases and they finally did this month! Its my first month of it and Ill likely keep it for a few months at least. My husband also has an iPhone  so we can share the cases which is nice.I am pretty impressed with the quality of the case itself Im used to ordering super cheap cases from DX.com so in comparison it is better.You cant choose your case but every month the look really nice and seem to be pretty unisex. One other thing thats pretty cool you can log in to the website and download a background of the same image to use as your lock screen that matches the case! Pretty neat touch.Its  a month with free shipping in the US and an extra  for shipping to Canada.I havent figured out how I can take a picture of it ON my phone yet since my phone is my only camera... but maybe Ill use my husbands phone next time so you can see the fit of the case on the phone itself. But its very slim and lowprofile and fits very nicely with the slightly curved edges of the iPhone . ,BeautyBoxes,cnxd7qs,3,t5_2uctp

The body lotion is sea fennel and it is light but not loving the scent either. I prefer floralcitrus. Plus I received a perfume and I never wear perfume so my mom will happily take this. I have bought an eyeko eyeliner before that dried out quick but this one seems to have been reformulated in new packaging.

With shampoo like this I put conditioner on my ends before I shampoo then I use just a little bit of shampoo on my roots and rinse it all out. The conditioner protects the ends from the harshness of the shampoo which dont need to be as heavily washed. Then I might use a little more conditioner on the ends again.This was all before I switched to cowashing though. I have fine hair and finally realized a lot of my breakage problems were caused by shampoo. Now I use it maybe once a week at most otherwise going with just conditioner.

4209231,0,t3_392o6u,I usually do take it on the chin when I get a sample I dont like because for one its fun to try new stuff sometimes that you wouldnt normally buy and secondly sampling something I discover I dont like stops me from wasting money on the fullsized version. The thing is while its rare sometimes we get a box with NO samples we like that are just complete mismatches for our skinhairbody type and its hard to not be disappointed by that. Or to not be disappointed when Birchbox comes out with a sample choice we look forward to only to find that its out of stock by the time we get the email. Not to mention all the perfume samples. Even if its only  its something we all look forward to and get our hopes up for so it sucks when its not what we hope for.

4929649,0,t1_cufm56g,well at the end of the day its just a concentrated moisturizer with more active ingredients. A good eye cream can make your eye areas really bright and smooth. However if you take care of your skin well and doesnt have signs of aging you dont have to use it by any means.  For some people its just like using hand cream over lotion and eating gelato over store ice cream...be warned that a lot of eye creams are really overpriced because the company can claim better ingredient for your eye area but whether they deliver what they promise thats always hard to say. If you do use it then its on you to find one that does its job at a reasonable price...HTH.

I got the shade Finale idk if every box has the same one or not and its definitely red but goes on sheer and can be built up. I think I only put on two layers and its a nice opaque red. I didnt have any problems with it not going on evenly though it was very even application for me.It dries down some to a sort of semimatte finish and has a slight tacky feeling if you press your lips together. You cant really rub your lips together once its set though. Thats a little odd but reminiscent of liquid lipsticks almost. It doesnt feel like its drying so far so while I dont know if I love it I dont outright hate it.Edit It also doesnt really seem to transfer much!

But after putting it on it gave the perfect rosy tint to my lips which doesnt look like I have a red lipstick on but still shows up like I have something on my lips. I dont apply makeup at all and feel very conscious when I put anything bright red on my lips but I dont like to keep my dry lips bare so usually I put on a tinted lipbalm. I know I sound weird  So all in all I like this lipstain and the only thing that could have been better is its staying power but that atleast means that I get to completely use up the bottle. HFTrestiQue Shadow Crayon As I said before I dont apply any makeup so I didnt really have any use for this.

Explain why you were excited to join them had tried Ipsy wanted to expand to more boxes based on a good experience with them that youve enjoyed the two boxes youve gotten from your subscription but that the two purchases youve made have made you upset for the reasons you outlined above.  Express that youre glad they tried to make it better with the previous order but that it wasnt the most satisfactory of solutions and now youve had a second issue.  Outline exactly what youd like done to fix the problem A replacement blush replacement box a reasonable value worth of points.  If you would like points calculate what YOU think the blush was worth and ask for the points needed to compensate for that  ?.  If you dont get a satisfactory answer reply back with a thank you for whatever solution they offer but I really feel that solution you would prefer was fair and can we find a middle ground.

7573905,0,t3_4j2d6g,Tbh thats what I assumed first... Ill be honest and say Mac and ABH are not brands Im familiar with for lip products. I did look up fake vs real ABH because Ive seen fakes going around ebay lately and the bottle looks like the real ones Ive seen but then the color is SO BRIGHT compared to swatches online and some of the label looks scratched and I just dont know.EDIT ABH says Milksuake. Yep. Fake. All fake. FAKE FAKE FAKE.Most sub boxes are able to make deals with the companies so its not like Lippe Box if it were legit which idk couldnt sustain two fullsize midrange lippiesmonth for . Look at BoxyCharm. Sure the brands arent MAC and ABH but the point is all of these boxes are considered marketing and advertisement for brands. So its not that weird to get two of these for . Idk.What concerns me most for the MAC one is not just the cosme tics but you udresscoder mentioned that theyre from  so then how come the codes suggest ?Tbh Im more likely to email ABH and MAC and ask if they have recently done business with Lippe Box  point out that a US company is selling fakes. I doubt the people at Lippe know theyre fakes I believe its illegal to sell fakes and market them as legit which they have done.Im a confused mess rn. On one hand I dont wanna be an ass but on the other hand it seems sketch? And companies and people should be aware when there are fakes? And what if the fakes are potentially dangerous?

7668303,0,t3_4k830i,Yes and no. I was disappointed regarding the value particularly in comparison to my Ipsy subscription and the Ipsy box is tailored more to my interests. Compared to Birchbox however... The samples seem more appealing to me for a little more value than what Ive typically seen from Birchbox and the  bonus points are a nice perk. That said I did like the products inside and I shop at Sephora to an embarrassing degree so it was nice to get to try out a few new things. Granted I can do that for free simply by stopping by the store and asking for a sample. Im going to give mine a few months to determine whether or not I want to keep it.

I follow fragrance closely since last summer I have learned enough about it to research and buy samples from online samplers. The Perfumed Court is a good place to buy samples. They carry a huge inventory of current discontinued vintage and hard to get frags that they decant into various size samples. A good place to nose around pun intended for information and reviews about fragrances is Fragrantica.  At TJMaxx I recently blind bought some celebrity fragrances to try and Geoffrey Beene Grey Vetiver my dad using only the info on Fragrantica on my smartphone. I rarely go to department stores  once early on I got some Creed and Diptyque samples. Later to Sephora for a bunch of designer samples. Ended up buying none of them but I got a noseful of education for what those lines were about. Im also on rfragrance where people wear everything imaginable and talk about it.

I for one am so disappointed that the SPF in both of my lip shade sheer lip butters what type of effd up name is that anyway will not be effective in a few weeks time.

I think my make up remover wipes are irritating my eyes because theyve been SO red and thats the only thing I can think of that would be bothering them.

8900349,0,t1_d7hogi7,I dont know of any coupons but there are full spoilers out. I believe My Subscription Addiction had posted them. Even without coupons though it only costs  for month to month subscriptions. The palette alone is worth around  and the other items in my opinion are a great value.Edit Yes I have done Glossybox and I was underwhelmed by the items and had many disappointing issues that were not resolved by their CS. Considering I was only with them for  months with so many issues I would never recommend them to someone else. I am still waiting for a response to a ticket for nearly a week ago which has to do with over charging. Though I do know some people love them it would depend on your personal preference on items and other things.

9346083,0,t3_58i8uu,I signed up for Birchbox Man last month because my boyfriend was jealous of my Sephora Play subscription. Weve only gotten one box so far but we like it. After the first month you get to pick one of the samples but theyre more like lifestyle items e.g. socks wallet razor.  For Octobers box he got a soft gray tshirt which he likes and was def worth the  cost of the box. Since it was our first month we didnt get to pick but the other two options were socks or a pair of bracelets so he lucked out with the shirt. There were two perfume samples a facial sunscreen sample an exfoliating facial cleanser sample and a small deodorant stick. We liked all of the items in the box except for one of the perfume samples. I claimed the deodorant since it doesnt smell too manly and he prefers clinical strength.  The sample choice for November was between a Harrys razor which we picked a wallet and some kind of small bagpouch. It should be arriving in a week or so and were both looking forward to it. ,BeautyBoxes,d90olrp,6,t5_2uctp

I asked them to just send me the items when they became in stock they are now but they just ignored that question saying they had already refunded me.  I would been satisfied with a more even pointmoney refund then them just taking back the points they used to compensate the late shipping.

To start I dump a small amount onto a small circular mirror. The one I use has suction cups and normally attaches to the shower but I attach it to my bathroom counter. I use a prepprimer by Mac to lightly spray my eyeshadow brush. Then I apply and it glides on smoothly. I clean up mistakes with a makeup sponge before applying foundation.

11633681,0,t3_65z5y0,Just reach out to CS. If youre not asking for a refund I dont see any reason why they cant convert your sub to a credit for the remaining months or a credit for a portion of what you paid  its still money in their system. From my experience with their CS its super slow but when they actually respond they are courteous and helpful.,BeautyBoxes,dgeov00,2,t5_2uctp
11637585,0,t3_660h2m,Definitely contact them and be sure to include a photo of the broken item. I had a broken lip liner one month and they sent me a replacement in my next box. ,BeautyBoxes,dgf4t5b,3,t5_2uctp

11662842,0,t3_66ew3a,Ive swapped more than x on there but recently took about half a year off because i got burnt out. I found it to be high in activity but I tried to have subscriptions that had items other than make up. I think makeup subscriptions may be plentiful and its possible that those items may get less nibbles. Also I think listings are sorted by users with high feedback being on the top. Since youre new your listings could be buriedlower on the swap item pages.Also if you dont hear from someone you requested a swap for you can kindly send them a note if theyre interested. Im guilty of sometimes hanging onto swaps if I dont see anything of interest and checking back to see if the requester adds more items. Good luck and welcome to my subscription addiction swaps!,BeautyBoxes,dghzxw9,4,t5_2uctp
11670368,0,t1_dgirmli,Youre definitely not coming across as a crybaby! I have found that many people dont keep their followed list updated Im guilty. I dont propose swaps anymore but I have noticed a significant decrease in the numer of swap requests I receive over the past few months. Not sure whats going on! ,BeautyBoxes,dgiuokj,1,t5_2uctp
