1096451,0,t1_chswwlj,This is for OP but you too if you have the same problem. zbrush works with things called tools which is basically a weird zbrush only term for models. It has a .d canvas and a d viewport. The .d canvas only works with painting and dragging out objects in .d kinda cool in a few ways you can make normal maps this way and do other stuff and a d viewport which is where you do sculpting. What you both are probably running into is that you drag one tool out and then drag out another thinking it is going into the same d space. It doesnt work like that. To edit and sculpt the first tool you dragged out you need to go into edit mode t. If you drag out another tool in hopes of adding it to your current model it will put the current state of your first tool into the .d canvas and allow you to edit the second tool. You havent lost the first one though it just needs to be called up again. Its saved in the tools palette. If you want to add a model to your first tool dont just drag one out because it will do the funky .d thing but instead append it as a subtool in the subtool menu and youll be able to work on it in d. I hope this helps the .dd distinct workspace thing was one of the weirdest parts of learning the software when I started using it. And always save your projects as a project .zpr  instead of a document because document will only save your canvas and no models. You can save ztools too .ztl if you only want to save the mesh. ,ZBrush,chsx5u3,2,t5_2tee4
2243569,0,t1_cloysd4,I second this statement.xNormal produces better results in the long run. However if you dont want to deal with raycasting cages and your in a hurry zbrush is still serviceable. And Im sure there are tweaks you can make in the settings to improve the quality though I havent taken the time to investigate those settings myself.,ZBrush,clp0dwh,2,t5_2tee4

3047804,0,t3_2v2fat,I wouldve done less folds on the sleeves. Even if youre trying to bring him into D still take note of how Disney made his sleeves just full of air rather then filled with folds.

3418005,0,t1_cphuu4c,This is how it looks I have  polygroups that I retopologized separatelyThe mesh is airtight and all quads so it will behave fine in any other package. Do some reading on that partial mesh documentation I linked above do some tests and see how it works.The dynamesh bit I mentioned as a side note not relevant here but you might find it useful if youve got a big project and cant afford and extra  million polys in places that dont even need them.edit just to clarify the polygroups are connected its a smooth surface. However depending on the situation you might see a seam which is the result of a sharp change in density. Usually you can smooth that seam out though the alternate smoothing method that preserves shapeedit more on the seam in the retopology tab there is the FreezeBorders option which will make it so that the welding seam is taken into account first as opposed to the polycount you specify and results in almost a perfect transition. I usually forgo that option since I want the polycount to be first priority.,ZBrush,cphvl2b,2,t5_2tee4

3848791,0,t1_cquyqgt,If youre using the latest ZBrush you should definitely check out the ZBrush to Keyshot Bridge plugin which will automatically import everything from ZBrush with a single click. But if you dont want to get into that you go into ZPlugin and Multimap Export you can select all the maps you want to export. Then you can import them into Keyshot in the Material Editor.Make sure you have UVs on your model! If you dont have UVs or dont know how to make them you can check out my videoIf you have UVs and just want to export the normal map check out Exporting Normal Maps in ZBrush,ZBrush,cquzvq8,1,t5_2tee4
3888528,0,t3_34z3br,The sculpt itself looks okay form here but your render is very dark. Never use a black background and try to ifx your lighting so we can actually see those details. Whenever someone posts something with dark lightingbackgrounds you wonder what theyre hidingmaking up for. Let the sculpt speak for itself avoid too much processing. he also looks oddly shiny all over his body might wanna reconsider that.,ZBrush,cqzixzk,2,t5_2tee4

4867914,0,t1_cu7hwdr,Thanks a lot for the feedback! I totally agree on the lighting. Ive never been that good at lighting to begin with but it does feel like a lot of objects are getting lost on the rider the axe especially. I think the only thing keeping it slightly apart is the materials at this point.Im not gonna lie I really fall short on texturing too. I get really impatient when Im doing texturing work so everything turns to shit before long and I disregard the object interaction thats necessary for believable textures. Having said that a lot of the scratches that are coming from the displacement on his armor were intended to be battle scars everything else from the bump was supposed to be normal wear which I tried to keep on the edges. I feel like it didnt really come out that way due to the specularity on my materials. The leather didnt look like that in mari at all in the diffuse the leather is lighter and less saturated on the edges and darker in the middle so somehow it go flipped around so I really need to revisit it and see what happened. Im ashamed to say for the chains I just ran a few procedurals native to modo on it to try and ding it up and I agree it came out too smooth so another thing to revisit for sure. Thanks again for the feedback I really appreciate it!,ZBrush,cu84yko,1,t5_2tee4

6241359,0,t3_412nnz,Some people Ive seen use only Zbrush to model and detail. But you cant really go into much detail with dsmax only. You need Mudbox Zbrush Quixel Suite etc. to generate highly detailed surface textures and normals.

8503873,0,t3_4w71pj,really study the anatomy and try nail those main forms before you go in to too much detail. Female faces are really hard to get right since you have to keep their features softer than on a male...the main things i see right off are the head is too wide the ears are too high and overall her features are too strong to the point where she doesnt look female. Try softening the chin and jaw line and go for more of a triangle shape right now its pretty square.,ZBrush,d64jdrq,6,t5_2tee4

9312642,0,t1_d8w1opg,Boolean subtractions would probably work for you.  After all you image was probably made in a CAD program like rhino or fusionI was able to do this in a few seconds so you should be able to use a similar technique in Zbrush.  After looking at the image again its pretty obvious how they did it.  First they started with a rectangular prism then they added the pattern through Boolean subtraction.  Finally they bent the rectangular prism into the shape that it is currently in.  ,ZBrush,d8wg27r,1,t5_2tee4
