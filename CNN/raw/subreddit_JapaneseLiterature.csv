Even more so because his ability to rewrite foreign stories while giving them a Japanese aspect is a part of the reason why I like reading his shortstories so much. To some extent this talent at recycling reminds me of Ueda Akinara and most notably his Ugetsu Monogatari.,JapaneseLiterature,cxc012t,2,t5_37zuz
