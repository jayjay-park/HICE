7603191,0,t3_4j9lso,. clipbrushes on the new boxes on nd mid should be covering the whole boxes not half of them. the height difference makes accurate shooting from there hard.. bombstuck at nd mid on the ventilator thing next to the bridge. nd mid at hay i like the way you made it easier to jump up but you get stuck on the right side when just walking ontop. should be a ramp or a consistent mass of edges. at a side in the earlier motocorner you can throw the bomb through a gap of clipbrushes on the right side so it is outside the map. aswell you shouldnt be able to boost on those pillars there. bomb stuck on the roof next to the well at ct spawnskilled throw.. electric cart in b construction. you can still hide behind it pretty good. ontop the attacker can see the feet but the air underneath the cart is not penetrable except with an awp. hiders advantage.... b construction wood planks are clippable always was ugly on old inferno,3kliksphilip,d36fz5z,1,t5_330yq

8081603,0,t1_d4jz6o8, With certain windows I cant tell that there are windows and I believe that they have had the glass shot out so I throw myself against it believing I can get out. I then hit the window shoot it out and then jump out. This once led to me being spotted and shot because it took five more seconds for me to get out the building.  then looks like this after shot out  This could just be me and my stupid brain but I couldnt tell such as in screenshot one in the spur of the moment that there was a window there. a wee question what is this room for?  This one. It has a sofa table two water bottles and then paintings on the other side of the wall. I ran into this room attempting to get a better view of a bomb site and I felt a twinge of what the fuck is this?. I felt like it was a horror game for a crack of a second. What is this room for? What is its background? this I like this. I wish I could shoot it off the wall but oh well. There is a spot where you can throw the bomb at T spawn and it gets stuck you cant retrieve it after that.  Its the Power Generator area standing by the power generator towards the truck jumping and throwing leads to what the screen shows. Bots get stuck in CT spawn.  Only in this spot. The odd black hole at T spawn.  can plant here  wish I could plant here  In my opinion too visible   wish I could plant on those barrels ,3kliksphilip,d4og3qe,1,t5_330yq

8151746,0,t1_d4jz9qd,Colata back again demicos now at version . and i think im pleased with the layout but i would like opinions on gameplay and specifically staging areas i feel empty as the best and most logical way to organise a staging area. I had began a staging area leading to A in the latest update but the ramp leading to B has really narrowed my imagination and i feel i need an outsider opinion to enlighten my on options and ideas i have not yet tried or thought of! Many thanks Colata!,3kliksphilip,d4wikwl,1,t5_330yq
8205360,0,t1_d4tt4fy,denatpasFirst map i ever made got  DLs however not much feedback.The map is very simple and the buildings are quite unproportional and unrealistic. Wanna see some feedback to improve it or to keep it in mind when making my next map.,3kliksphilip,d5383ha,1,t5_330yq
8441680,0,t1_d4tt4fy,For the community testing I would like to have my defuse map dequaint to be tested. I realize that it is a very small and perhaps simple map but I believe it has potential. I am willing and able to make the adjustments or even redo parts of the map based off of community feedback. I am not the perfect expert map maker but I am determined to make this map shine. I have play tested this map as much as I could with bots and a few friends but in order to improve this map I really need to have at least v. Play testing would enable me to continue working on this map. At the moment I almost feel stuckIm only able to add aesthetics without proper feedback. Im ambitious and I want to develop this map because I enjoy playing CSGO and mapping for it. I dont want to become famous I want my map to be the greatest.,3kliksphilip,d5wqyy3,1,t5_330yq

9491778,0,t3_5935z8,If you want to open these CSGO maps in Source Filmmaker  First you need to download GCFScape so you can get the textures etc. for the maps into the SFM SDK.  Go into SteamgtsteamappsgtcommongtCounterStrike Global Offensivegtcsgo and open pakdir.vpk. Extract ALL THE FILES into the SFM folder. Thats SteamgtsteamappsgtcommongtSourceFilmmakergtgamegtcsgo.  Launch Source Filmmaker. Open the SFM SDK NOT THE CSGO SDK OR IT WONT OPEN IN SFM open the .vmf you want to turn into a .bsp. FilegtRun Map and Set Run VIS amp Run RAD to Fast. I dont know what happens if you change the settings let me know if its better to do it some other way.  When its done compiling put the .bsp in SourceFilmmakergtgamegtcsgogtmaps. If you are getting a Bad detail brush side error I have no idea wtf is causing this  Go to SourceFilmmakergtgamegtusermodgtgameinfo.txt. Find the bit where it says SearchPaths add a line that says Game            csgo. Save it. Now you can open SFM and load in Philips CSGO map ,3kliksphilip,d9j2c39,1,t5_330yq

11689235,0,t1_dgkwua4,Make the tunnel on to b site slanted towards mid. My thought with it is that back sniper box wouldnt have as good of an angel and between exit and red box would have small gap for shots.Would make the equivalent spot on site for CTs window which wouldnt be covered from mid. I think it would make b site takesretakes more interesting ,3kliksphilip,dgkzqye,1,t5_330yq
11690587,0,t1_dgkwuds,I would add a one way drop section to the former long doors similar to the drop  on Cobblestone. It will make ts pushing long really commit and it stops cts from getting to aggresive by pushing. IMO you should be able to boost up from the other side so its not completely one way.,3kliksphilip,dgl59km,1,t5_330yq
