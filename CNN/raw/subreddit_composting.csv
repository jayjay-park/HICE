Im considering getting some cheap fencing and just building a couple of bins out of that for now while I sort this out. ,composting,cgcgc8z,1,t5_2t2ih

1959648,0,t1_ckpc0su,I can say at least that mold is common in bins Though I dont know if I should be concerned when I see it.It could be some issue if they get cold during their travel.  They are usually packed with some stuff to help them survive.  You might try to find someone on here or rvermiculture to send you some.  Otherwise there are websites to order from if you have a credit card.,composting,ckpc8nh,2,t5_2t2ih

2344580,0,t1_cm0w9y7,adultBSF are very competitive amp territorial... theyll get rid of the fruit flies the mosquitoes and many other pestbugs. Theyre kinda like roosters but even more so in that they have one mission in life breed. their second mission? defending their ability to breed... ie territory. ...and creating or protecting an environment that their larvae can survive amp thrive.  the adults dont even eat. they dont even have mouths. They only live for a week or two tops .. the larvae eat everything when theyre young store it... and the adults go do their deal until they lay eggs then die....their deal includes ripping other insects apart that threaten their territory. Theyll gangkill them if they have to. Very territorial ... and not a pest to humans. ...in the least. House flies all but disappear mosquitoes get destroyed ... and fruit flies from what ive read. though Ive never witnessed a fruitfly death by adultBSF.Ive posted a bunch of links to rblacksoldierfly ... they talk about this in many of them includingesp the comments. ...the accounts peopleve seen etcI personally wouldnt want fruit flies around. I dont think they cause any harm? but theyre annoying as hell!,composting,cm1i2ni,2,t5_2t2ih

I believe he is sheet composting initially and making compost furrows next to his greenhouses for vermaculture processing.

4420670,0,t3_3bli64,Im not an expert or anything but i talked to an expert about this a couple weeks ago what he said was the compost moisture should give it the consistency of a wrung out sponge.  If your adding kitchen scraps thats usually enough moisture to maintain that. But you can put it in as long as its biodegradable it wont have a negative effect aside from the additional hydration. Im in a drought so ive been doing this just to get alittle moistness in there but i dont have a soap brand i can recommend. Good luck!,composting,csny0hk,5,t5_2t2ih

11216032,0,t3_602eie,If you dont want to go to intense with actually building something you can always use a few trash cans with holes drilled in to allow more air to come in. That way you can also have separate piles so that when one fills up you can keep turning it and put any new waste in the next trash can and have a rotating cycle of finished compost. ,composting,df3bntn,1,t5_2t2ih

11345412,0,t3_61v542,a bin an area sectioned off. I used pallets wired to a chainlink fence and wired together to make my bin. Having  sidebyside was handy so I could turn the contents of one bin into the other every  weeks. I also put in vertical air shafts into my bins every  feet to allow for fresh air for the microbes. While I forked the compost from one bin into the other. I had a water sprayer spraying water over the compost I was forking over the common wall between the bins.Glad to assist. Ask the questions you need to to get going on this. Do you live where it is warm? I live in Mpls MN.,composting,dfhzdn1,1,t5_2t2ih
