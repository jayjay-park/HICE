Most importantly I feel that people of good moral must go to space in this ship. Without good moral or a positive outlook on those situation the entire ship suffers. It creates an environment of negativity. The ship is still in the first stages and must be worked on more as every time I think of the possible things that could go wrong it creates another question.,futures2017,dconzm6,2,t5_3iiwo
10652747,0,t1_dcol6oa,I agree. This could eventually lead to far more companies beginning to enter the field creating economic opportunity in space.During the campaign Mike Pence promised that he and Pres. Trump agreed that they wanted to put more funding into NASA saying that America is falling behind somewhere that we should be on top. Lets hope that there was some meaning behind that.,futures2017,ddeqz02,1,t5_3iiwo

10807285,0,t1_ddqgfnj,If it works it better be good but just reading about it seems dangerous. Humans dont have a background with this technology so it isnt easy to make things safe. ,futures2017,ddup1r1,1,t5_3iiwo
10827179,0,t1_ddl5ens,I agree. This article has more of a outlook on the negatives of a space travel which is good because we have no idea whats up there and how much it would cost us. ,futures2017,ddwqwk5,1,t5_3iiwo
10888013,0,t1_ddsv65q,Perfectly said. This is an extremely long term project so anything that goes wrong would be extremely detrimental to Earth and probably destroy our other options of exploring space due to the immense costs of getting the elevator up and running and then having to clean up the damage if something goes wrong. At this stage in our space exploration I dont think we should slow down our space research but we definitely need to consider other safer options. ,futures2017,de30rlq,1,t5_3iiwo
