7678868,0,t3_4khgyr,Aye. I feel like that is a very small set of consonants though. Perhaps include l or similar to be able to pronounce Barlae and what every else is needed to name what the beast thing gets named. See turn ,NationQuest,d3f1i6t,1,t5_3eopz

7725756,0,t3_4l0clz,On religious matters I would like to take one of the ideas advanced by Kraftworld gt For the Alosi it wasnt gods that excelled them into this golden age it was the doing of great men and women with great intellect and a vision for the future of their people. But change it a little bit.Yes the Alosi believe in gods as pretty much every civilization at this time but the belief is not hard set nor never named. Because they are and because they create. But they dont build they dont help. They are the earth the sea the sky. But thats it. You respect the earth because it gives the plants you respect the sky that gives water you respect the sea that gives fishes.The one guiding us are our ancestors. Those are the one that built the first city those are the one that built our civilization those are the one that built the first digging stick to farm the land those are the one that built the first net to catch our fish. We walk the path of our ancestors.Ancestors have names and are revered. Something between shinto ancestors and christian saints  You pray the name of your grandfather and his father after that but everyone pray the names of the great ancestors of the Alosi. And a great ancestor is someone who inventedcreatedbuilt some things of importance. The guy who built the first fishing net and managed to use it for example. He would be like the patron of fishing. Also in a way The Alosi do not formally worship science or progress. But since they emulate the great ancestors the creators the most devout or glory seekers will try to build their own things. ,NationQuest,d3kd4hr,4,t5_3eopz
