2400,0,t1_ceeerg3,Haha I enjoy raiding occasionally but my group and I try not to kill only steal its a fun challenge. For example we will surround small groups on the road and talk to them before they see us telling us to drop their weapons if they dont drop we will all approach and if they fire they die if they give us a bunch of wood or something nice they live. Its kinda fun sometimes.I got a bit angry when some bandits grenaded a base I worked on for days with some friends though they killed us and walled off our doors built random shit everywhere and Ced a bunch of walls.

32821,0,t3_1uhkwz,Things I do   Farm resources in the valleys instead of near the roads. People with gear tend to stay away from wide open areas as it leaves them vulnerable.   Scan the area in between swings when miningharvesting to check if someone is sneaking up on you.   Immediately establish a shelter with a door a sleeping bag and a storage crate to hold your goods temporarily. Make sure it is hidden well on a populated server. I usually do it in this order Shelter gt sleeping bag hidden nearby not within gt crate gt door.  Carry only what you need to get the job done when you leave your shelter.   If you do find armor or weapons do not equiphold them in hand unless youre not afraid to lose them. Most people will ignore a naked guy running around with a rock and they wouldnt expect you to have a gun if they try to hold you up.   Appear friendly and try to avoid people or confrontation when possible. I find that using voice communication will help greatly in situations like these.   If youre being pursued by someone try to be unpredictable. Move in erratic patterns and try to use the mountainscliffs to lose them if possible.  The hard part is setting up a house before someone find you. My first house will usually be more of a secure storage area and I will do a T design up against the cliffs with the intersecting room being the storage area surrounded by metal doors. It takes at least  C to break into that storage area. A good idea if you have the resources it to build multiple shelters scattered about with metal doors and split your goods up between them. Dont put all your wood in one and then all your metal in another you want to make sure you have something of everything just in case you lose one of the shelters.,playrust,cei62ap,2,t5_2xks2

126838,0,t3_1vj7xf,Any of this advice can be disregarded if youre ok with dying. AKA you have a sleeping bag somewhere and youre not carrying a tonne of resources. To get into a fire you HOLD E and click open.  This is how you cook meat. Do not eat raw meat.  Gather every wood pile and rock you see. Run from anybody betterdressed than you ESPECIALLY if they say stuff like Hey come here man you want some food? Build a frigging wood house with a metal door eventually a shack with a wood door will do while you get enough wood and metal.  This is because wooden doors and shelters are easy to hack through with hatchets.  Metal doors and wooden houses are deterrents they require C or something powerful to get through.  Do not put a metal door on a wooden shelter this is a giant bullseye. Hide your real house.  Dont tell people where it is.  My entire happiness in Rust has come from this piece of advice if somebody knows where you live eventually they can raid it. Try to find friends probably near where you gather resources but be prepared to die while you do so.  Leave all your good shit at home Learn the map.  Watch the video getting around in Rust I find it quite helpful.  Radtowns are unique learn where they are so you can find yourself.  Have fun!

Its the messing up of the house which is the issue.I actually planned out the house using that tool thanks for the reference but the plan was for a four story house which leaves stair holes in each floor so even if I finished up to level two theyll just build three sets of stairs on the outside and get in anyways. And some of us have lives such as work and a social life so we dont have time to go collect k wood per play session. Again people seem to be unaware that Im well aware its part of the game and an alpha and that the server will get wiped hopefully soon its starting to get crowded and have no issue with PvP. As mentioned in another response my issue is PvEmptyHouse. Theyre not good enough to break into a clan house or anything so they walk around looting unfinished houses because thats all they can get.

193839,0,t3_1wa6qe,My favorite way to figure out the map is to marathon. By marathon I mean acquire an internet map with names of cities and preferably photos of them. start in morning Get nakedeat lots of food find the road run like hellNumber   I cant emphasize enough. Once you hit that road Forrest Gump it. Get going and dont look back. Run the road look around look at the towns. Compare the names and know the locations both rad town and player structures. If something happens to your bag and you spawn elsewhere you can find the road and hopefully quickly figure out where you are. If you happen upon strangers use your judgement. I usually serpentine around and hope that all their bullets miss cuz my server is full of KOSers. This tactic may not work for you but i do it at least once Im on to stay fresh.

I had been playing almost a month and didnt realize that lol.  But even funnier is another  days go by and the guy tells me I have access to his doors via share.

246940,0,t3_1wwqlv,For me and my crew it depends on who we raided and where. For our average raid usually we blow in a couple of walls on a medium sized house kill any sleepers and loot a house until weve gotten all the good stuff.Then theres the invaders. Some prick and his friends get themselves some gear and build up a big ass tower in an open field while were offline. We log on finally to see this eyesore nearby our main house. Already that tower gets itself a high spot on our raiding list. Eventually the prick finds himself looking out the window of his wooden fortress and hes feeling pretty invincible. He thinks why not? and fires at anyone who comes in bolt action range of his tower eventually striking one of our teammates. Bad move. We wait until him and his cronies log off. Aside from cleaning the place out we break everything thats destructable with a pickax  stairs crates etc put ceilings over the stair areas and cover the floor in spike walls. If you build in our territory and start shooting at us we take the aggression out on your base and get our message across youre not welcome here. ,playrust,cf6cjw2,1,t5_2xks2

251852,0,t3_1wzr9r,I havent RQ but Ive come close simply because I spend  hours a day playing the game its fun! but I get raided by people with full kevlar and full weapons etc. every other day regardless of where I am so its just a drag right now to basically farm so hard and get nothing for it .  In particular there is one guy that has killed me at least  times.  It is really frustrating to be behind and have hardly an opportunity to get ahead.  Yesterday I finally found some blueprints for kevlar maybe things will change if I log on tonight still alive in my little shackId rather trade resources for BP but thats not really an optimal strategy for someone that already has a bolt action and c already.  It doesnt help that Im on a server where airdrops happen only when admin calls them in which has happened maybe twice now.  That means that the only way to get c bolt action etc. is to kill someone who has it already or trade not optimal for them ... so not really gonna happen.The game needs major endgame balance and a way for new players to build up a stash that is protected from raiding  murder without more than a  minute time investment.  In other words yeah I could build a xx cube and place a treasure room in the middle but that would take HOURS of farming and crafting.  That xx cube with a treasure room in the center could be breached by  c.  So basically hours of farming results in protection from  c which is not that hard for an endgame character to have...  The alternative of course would be to spread your loot out and have several less secure stashes but that is inefficient time consuming and a determined player wouldnt have much of an issue there either.On the other hand it only costs  wood to build a spike wall which takes about  seconds to findfarm.  Spike walls last for  days and can clip through walls or across doors.  So basically a  wood investment can waste either an endgame players c or a few minutes of time as they attack the wall die respawn and eventually break it.  This means that as a beginner player with little to no access to endgame items my greatest retaliation is to just grief my enemies housesstructures.... not a great goal but the only attainable one.The game needs to encourage teamwork and trading and discourage the raiding of single or nonhostile players.  It should be a better strategy for an endgame player to trade technology for resources with early players to make friends and to free their time from farming to raid but because it is so easy to rape and pilliage when you have tens of c at your disposal.... well you get the idea.  The noob starts over and the OP gets to add another layer of security to his house andor build extra weaponsarmorammoc to continue raiding with.ampnbspJust a nice side note about how fun endgame players are.  My buddy was trying to farm wood yesterday so we could rebuild again.  He had a rock an axe torches and bandages.  Gets killed by a guy with a bolt action comes back to his body yards from the shack and yep... bolt action dude reaaallly needed an axe apparently.,playrust,cf6uxgq,3,t5_2xks2

After ton of hours Ive found a server that works for me and has a trustworthy admis who is constantly adding new and interesting mods to the server and doesnt play abusivly. I almost quit Rust twice before finding this server though.All and all Rust can be extremely demoralizing if you are a soloplayer on an agressive server but truly shines as a game if you can find a thriving community. If you choose to play send me a PM and maybe I can get you on our friendly but still pvp server.,playrust,cfk8nww,3,t5_2xks2

435424,0,t3_1z1f31,Me too I stopped playing on my fav server because of the hackers. The server had active admins on but it failed to stem the hackers during the day when I was not on. Another issue was because of sheer amount of discreet hackers you dont know if it is skill or hacks. For instance the streamer Bchillz was getting suspicious kills on a server I was on but on the stream he seems to just be good. But his brother flynn or something was seen flying around the map. I guess its the not knowing if someone is hacking or not is the part that really ruins the game for me. ,playrust,cfpwaf1,1,t5_2xks2
436863,0,t1_cfpnff4,I think a sling  rather than a slingshot  would be more appropriate.  cloth and  leather for the pouch to make.In this case I believe slings should do as least as much or more damage than an arrow. Slings are much stronger than bows in terms of power because of the immense build up of energy made from twirling it around. Often games depict slings as much weaker than bows Chivalry Medieval Warfare and I believe Total War but this is not the case.  Although you may say that a sling made of a bit of shirt would not be as strong as the military grade slings made in the past thus making my argument invalid the bow would not be as strong as the military grade bows made in the past either meaning that the sling would still be comparatively more powerful. Also I think the bow would suffer more as a result of poor craftsmanship than a sling would.Bodyshot damage from the sling would be as follows instant death to nakeds from a bodyshot large amount of damage done to someone in cloth armour large in leather and medium in Kevlar. Head shots would kill everyone instantly bar those in Kevlar in which it would do a large amount of damage.Overpowered? To balance it out the sling would take a while to gain the momentum it needs before firing and it would be extremely hard to hit with. What would be good about this weapon is that if a new spawn is being chased down by a cloth bearing hooligan with an assault rifle this weapon gives them a chance albeit small of defeating their enemy.EDIT I also believe that the sling should have more range than a bow unless they put in longbows because that is how the sling in real life as well.,playrust,cfq1nwu,0,t5_2xks2

He would often call out how many people were in each base over stream like it was no big fucking deal this was back when he got at most  at peak times and averaged around  viewers not sure what it is like now but you could tell out of those  who were watching would only talk when accusations came up about hacking leading me to believe they were the people he was playing with or his gfs account and multi logged. That being said he has been caught by me and others actually cheating on stream he had no clipped through trees and through wallspillars in the heat of the momentno clipped through trees when he was drunk and I had been banned for calling him out on it watching his reaction when he ran through the tree and immediately looked at twitch chat sold me on it he is a scumbag cheater or at the very least is still profiting off of other cheaters. I wont forget that look of oh shit I hope nobody was watching that and then drunkenly laughing it off after calling him out for it. If I only had enough hindsight to record it I wouldnt have to make a throwaway for this and I wouldve posted it a long long time ago.Not even to mention he has been vac banned for cheating at Counterstrike watch the videos of him getting caught and tell me he wouldnt do that shit again.,playrust,cgmnnyh,20,t5_2xks2

They are talking about procedural maps something that should have been relatively set in stone during the first iteration of code.  This among other decisions lead me to believe they have no idea what direction they are going with the game.Alas they seem to have gotten some direction but I as a customer have no idea what the game I bought is going to look like in a year.So now they are recoding the game which would not have been necessary if they coded it correctly to begin with.  And even then you run the risk of a stale project if you try to get your code perfect.

978788,0,t3_25bd3v,Check out the community at rCivcraft I guess. Weve been running a player run minecraft server for years now ironing out this very problem youre hitting at. It functions a lot like Rust in many ways. Bear with me. You need some way to fortify your bases your containers and your possessions from destruction or access that goes beyond simple tiering of stuff. What they did over there is give the player the ability to place blocks with extra durability to them at the cost of an arbitrary amount of resources. Lets say you build a castle or some stupid shit. Youll want to have reserves of stone for every cobble you place one stone block to fortify every cobble block you throw down. What this does is it forces invaders or griefers to break each block  times before it actually breaks. Stones the lowest tier you can also fortify with iron for  breaks and diamond for some shitton amount of breaks I cant be assed to remember. People will build vaults that literally take hours of non stop breaking to breach. It requires large groups of people breaking shit at the same time working together to overcome the protections. If youre still with me this far imagine a similar system implemented in Rust. I dont care that much to hash it out but someone else can totes go ahead and imagine for me. This is a tried and true solution that has worked in the past that forces people to work together in groups to accomplish shit. Civcraft was just a social experiment after all. Study their failures. Im sure some of them played Rust as well.,playrust,chfjoss,5,t5_2xks2

1360167,0,t1_cimq207,Yes. It all depends. First of all you have to have to want to learn programming. I mean serious interest. Its not like learning to ride a bike or something like that.I dont think Ive ever read a programming book except books that are about patterns in programming but those books are for people who already know programming quite well. My favorite book in question is Design Patterns Elements of Reusable ObjectOriented Software if anyone is interested.Im guessing that reading the most favored programming books on Amazon will do you a favor but in the end programming is all about DOING and REDOING when things dont go the way you like.I could probably ramble on for hours about this but the simplest advice is just start doing it. If you have the genuine interest it will work out just fine. ,playrust,cimsc2z,1,t5_2xks2

Its pretty informative and it would behoove you to consider the things it states because clearly you havent. Now Im not saying Wikipedia is the end all be all source of info but it seems pretty accurate to me and addresses some of your points. As for the racial thing here While the term Eskimo is sometimes considered offensiveit is not in its linguistic origins a fundamentally offensive word.gtIf someone from Africa moves to Canada it does not mean that they got their color from living in the North. I was addressing basic sun exposure I think you are going way overboard on your replies.  The original Eskimo comment I made was somewhat facetious because you said people by the equator have dark skin. gtRussians Canadians Scandinavians Icelandic and English all live in the north and are very pale. It is not a completely perfect rule but most people in the north that have darker skin came from somewhere else.No shit but read the timeline in the article. Here againSeveral earlier peoples existed in the region and the earliest positively identified North American Eskimo cultures preDorset date to  years ago. They appear to have evolved in Alaska from people related to the Arctic small tool traditionin Asia who probably had migrated to Alaska at least  to  years earlier.

2105253,0,t1_cl7ezzn,That is a pretty stupid way of thinking about it. The game became playable and people played hundreds of hours of it. It costs  bucks to see a movie for maybe  hours of entertainment. My  bucks for Rust has given me hundreds of hours of entertainment. What you are saying is that when you buy a game and there are bugs and there always are hence games always getting post launch patches or updates later on you feel like a game tester and that you should be paid for it? When someone buys an Early Access game they should understand that it is an unfinished product. You got a problem with that then you dont fucking pay for it. And that makes me wonder what you are even doing here. Do you own the game? Have you played the game? If you have then you have also likely paid for it. What is your point exactly? If you thought  bucks was too much money to buy an unfinished product then why did you buy it?You seem to have missed that point of an alphaearly access game and now you want to bitch about it not being feature complete and all problems solved.,playrust,cl7f96z,6,t5_2xks2

Will modded servers not give blueprints through steam? If they do are there some restrictions to what mods are allowed to prevent crazy influx of blueprints? If theres a monetary component do we need to start worrying about botting becoming a big problem?In my opinion I like the idea of tradeable blueprints but Id rather they be cosmetic.

Sounds like he wants to to be geared more towards cosmetic things that if change anything give no obviously discernible advantage over all the other players.What he has been saying also sounds like he plans on people being able to come across all this stuff completely on their own.Slightly off topic  you should consider going through all your steam trading cards and selling them all. Its super easy like  clicks per item to sell it. Especially since you dont get into the whole trading card thing you can see yourself actually get some return from the games you play and invest in a new indie game or something.

Although I do believe that if people were set on playing based on wipes then sticking to Legacy would have been a good way to go. It was also like playing on a leaderboard where you had to rush the game. If Rust can progress beyond this would substantially more things to do more to find etc. then wipes shouldnt be necessary.I almost wish Terraforming was a thing in this game as building your house could be more middle game stuff.

If it is solely based on blueprints then tools have to be developed for certain structures stone maybe be stronger than metal but a welder would be useless against it. Also certain features could be developed for exterior structures as addtive bonuses. For instance a wall could be fitted with sliding armor to prevent people front building walls right next to it or barbwired tops so people attempting to climb ontop and break in would have to slowly clear the tops.

But I agree with OP that melee combat is hilariously bad. I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that melee isnt solely tied to combat but also its used for gathering resources and smashing walls. As such weve got incredibly fast attack speeds and the swings dont feel like theyve got any power to them at all. I think a fairly simple solution would be to lower the rate of attack and increase the amount harvesteddamage done to walls. ,playrust,cm4sn36,7,t5_2xks2

2896317,0,t3_2tac69,Its interesting to see this concept shaping up. With aging I hope that this means we will be seeing buildings designed to last long in anticipation of servers that do not wipe or wipe very rarely.I hope that there is a ruins phase put somewhere into the decay and aging process where the building starts to fall apart and players could have a choice betweenIgnoring it until it does eventually vanishSalvaging it and making it vanish faster in exchange for a return of some materials. This could encourage players to keep the servers clean when players leave or stop playing effectively getting rid of the litter of small or halffinished structures. RepairingReclaiming where players can repair the structure and gain ownership of it like the locksdoors. This would be a cool way to ensure that if a player builds an epic structure or if a structure has some server history e.g. the ol meeting hall that was used for a long time then it can continue to function even if the player who originally built it is long gone. This could end up with some cool continuity on servers and it would be an interesting option for new players starting out on older servers because they might be able to reclaim an existing structure for their use instead of building from scratch.Just some ideas.,playrust,cnxbdg7,2,t5_2xks2

Raiding generally doesnt generate a C return either so usually when you hit a base you may get guns and hatchets but you probably wont get back as much sulpher as you put into the raid.

3570605,0,t3_318b9j,The first Sandbox Survival Game that scales to thousands of concurrent users and drops the server shards paradigm will win the next big prize. That requires these Indy type developers to invest into scalable infrastructure and run their own server farms. This used to be a nogo and would require a large upfront investment of treasure and man hours. However now a days with Azure and AWS and other cloud infrastructure hosting your game on scalable servers that can expand from  VM to  VMs is not only doable its cheap. You literally pay only for what you use. If you sell k keys and you get hammered on a Monday you can fire up hundreds of new VMs in seconds run them for the rest of the day and then we people lose interest by Tuesday your infrastructure scales back down.Writing good server code that takes advantage of the new cloud capabilities requires a different type of game programmer.

Skybridging stairless rockwater bases no fall dmg when logging out to get anywhere you want etc are the larger issues. As much as I abhor the cupboard design it helps a lot more people that it hurts. I still manage to get into almost any base I want with c pickaxes and lots of wood and planning.I think instant building part healing is something that should be adjusted right away. As annoying as it would be to have  people beating on your wall they should be able to take that wall down with only a few people inside to keep it up.As fun as raiding could be in legacy but lets be honest who needed to raid? You could exploit  different ways into any base needed. I dont want the new version of Rust to revert to every base you come across in the woods having  different twig towers around it from someone already trying to get in. A raiding ladder that came at a price per block height would be interesting especially if it became grounded to where it was placed so the raider had to make a tactical decision on where they wanted to try and blow in at a cost.Ultimately I would love for there to be some middle ground someday in Rust where people could actually build their homes at least partly for enjoyment while having some safeguards.,playrust,cq1h0n5,2,t5_2xks2

Having a big crafting time will reward you just because You believe that grinding is rewarding.Im not saying you shouldnt invest time to build and to acquire new things but this is ridiculous. Id rather jump into action than hit a barrel or die searching for chests in rad towns. Or better try getting in rad towns that have been walled by players just because its fun or because they feel like owning resources. Too bad barrels dont spawn in a fixed location people would have enough reasons to wall everything until there are just  players on the map because fresh spawns wont have any means to progress.Anyway having to spend way too much time is annoying. Youre forgetting about frequent server wipes servers that close after some period admin abuse which you might find later on players who wall every rad town yeah most people avoid those kind of servers.I just cant see a progression in running around and hitting barrels for hours days whatever. After so many hours hundreds in the new rust I found  metal chestplate bp on a fun server with huge loot. Yes I did play on a lot of servers.  ,playrust,cqq0bvj,2,t5_2xks2

It seems like its a pretty respectable business model and they often offer support for your gaming server beyond just Not our game so not our problem. You have to find out how to fix it.For a lot of different reasons for different people a game server host is a perfectly acceptable option. They take care of a lot of the overhead of installs and maintenance on a server.I do not disagree that hosting yourself or going through a VPS can save you money. Especially if you know what you are doing. I prefer VPS environments because working in the IT field the more control I have over my equipment or environment the better but I can think of quite a few reasons a group should and could go for a GSHost and where it would be worth it at the right price point.,playrust,cqqqlvt,1,t5_2xks2

3883402,1,t3_34vncv,Mostly playing devils advocate here but I have to admit Im not a fan of the map although I figured it would inevitably make its way into Rust. Heres why Im torn on the one hand maps are so common and useful it would be weird for a survival game not to have one. Theres also a significant amount of people who need it to not get lost genetic lottery with sense of direction I guess.However after starting fresh this wipe I randomly found a great spot for a base. After setting up and doing some exploring it turns out I was on the border of both desert and snow biomes.I started doing barrel  mining runs going a little further each time I saw a barrel in the distance. Two days later I know both biomes like the back of my hand. I can run  minutes deep into the snow and mountains chasing barrels and easily find my way back.When someone chases me I know cracks in the rocks to hide. Many times I just run away towards the most desolate place I can see and they quickly give up the chase probably for fear of getting lost.Im really digging that right now. It adds to the survival atmosphere when knowledge of the land without a map or compass yields tangible advantages in game.Personally although it might be a selfish suggestion I would prefer a blank map that does not autoupdate. You can draw on this map yourself. You can also make copies of maps you made.This might start up a new market for good maps. Good cartographers can make bank selling detailed maps to clans especially if they include bases. You would have to be extremely careful with your clan maps because you dont want your rival to get them. There is also the possibility for deceit with fake maps mark clan c stash on map die to enemy on purpose set up ambush in said location.Doing it that way would probably be way more cool but also more inconvenient. I hope its at least considered and  or tested someday ,playrust,cqyxw2u,-1,t5_2xks2

3894285,0,t1_cr04l8j,What Im saying is that only a small vocal minority of players want guns to be so primitive that they are barely a step above muskets or breechloaded rifles. I understand that some people dont like how toptier weapons and ammunition can be crafted with simple materials but until more indepth crafting mechanics are added the current system works just fine. The guns dont make the game but they play a significant role and it would be best to keep them as they are until the developers implement a method of crafting toptier weapons using machinery and the like. The DayZ analogy refers to how limited player ability is for the sake of realism. Its movement system is intentionally clunky so that players move more realistically weapons are very rare and it takes  seconds to perform a basic action. Rust however sacrifices realism so that players are not limited and can play however they want to play. In Rust players can build giant metal towers and fortresses build weapons with basic materials make hazmat suits with cloth and metal and craft medical supplies with animal fat cloth and metal. These things dont make the game bad they just make it sillier more arcadeish and less hardcore and thats what I think Rust aims to be. ,playrust,cr06kww,4,t5_2xks2

Those  people already have a huge advantage in being able to farm materials  times faster than solos or small groups plus the perks of raiding faster and being safer in numbers.

What I have proposed has nothing to do with changing the difficulty and if you think that having someone being able to to afk pickaxe a wall down adds difficulty to the game youre wrong. Sure there are strategies on how to efficiently and effectively build a base to help prevent that but those only stall people for a little while. With how cheap pickaxes are there nearly nothing from stopping people from doing this aside from being online all day.ampnbspListen I get it the idea is probably not going anywhere near the actual game but why does that mean I cant make suggestions to a game I actually really like instead of standing idly by and watching it go in a direction I dont want?

It isnt really the griefing the tool cupboard was implemented to prevent as that would imply they ruined a base which would otherwise have been ok i.e they block the entrance to an otherwise secure base so you cant get out.Im not saying they werent dicks for going over the top but it is more of a moral issue than a game design issue when some  year old with no life experience decides to powertrip on folk who have to work.,playrust,crisvry,1,t5_2xks2

4072018,0,t1_crkfer4,Its not amazing. Its common fucking sense. And seriously since this time last week most of my group has been busy with finals and has not been on. I havent been around much either. We get maybe an hour or two on right now. Theres been plenty of times when were all offline for almost a full  hours. People know where our base is. Weve been vocal about who weve raided. And weve been threatened to be raided in retaliation more times than I can count. Were still sitting there. The only damage weve taken since ladders have been out is decay rate on out outer foundations.  If ladders make it so easy to breeze through with out any work and its sooo impossible to defend against them if youre not online tell me why the base isnt a looted shell? I play on a lower pop server and weve pissed off just about everyone else at one point or another by raiding them. Most of them have recovered and have been cooking up C for two weeks or longer now. Some groups have even banded together specifically to kill and raid us. Yet were still there. Our loot is still there.  Theres no ladders up our walls no gaping holes no broken cupboards. And its not as if the server has been dead. Theres a steady stream of people on there. Maybe just maybe its because decent design. ,playrust,crkfquv,1,t5_2xks2

4101105,0,t3_37lobk,I agree that raiding offline players is a necessary evil in this game and that the game should be harsh and unforgiving.That isnt the core issue in my opinion.  The bigger problem is how ridiculously easy it is to raid an offline player compared to the amount of grinding  farming it takes to construct a base.  Either explosives need to be the only wall destroying item foundations  walls strengthened or traps  base defenses need to be added for their to be an appropriate balance.   ,playrust,crnr20v,1,t5_2xks2
4103536,0,t1_cro0b9h,Oh yeah I probably forgot to answer this part. Furnaces and campfires in Rust have an inherent temperature which is how they are able to process materials that they do. As long as the furnacecampfire is onlit it will process the materials at the set rate. This processing rate has no relation to how fast the furnacecampfire consumes fuel. So metal smelting rates will probably stay the same unless that was changed as well.Thats how it worked when experimental first started anyway.,playrust,cro10u5,2,t5_2xks2

4129097,0,t3_37y0vn,Hi DroneFWI am one of the Oxide core developers I was not involved with Oxide  and only started contributing to the project after the Oxide  alpha was released.Oxide  only supported lua the problem with lua and other scripting languages is that interacting with the server requires calling into .Net which has some additional overhead and that overhead can add up quickly when plugins need to do more than simple tasks.Oxide  is a modular decoupled generic .Net modding framework. The core is not game or even engine specific and can be used for any game which has a .Net runtime. There are extensions for Unity and other engines and quite a few different games are already in various stages of being supported.I initially added CSharp plugin support to Oxide mainly for performance allowing plugins to run alongside the Facepunch C code and interact directly with it with zero additional overhead. Oxide  now supports a few different languages but the majority of plugins are C as many plugin authors have rewritten their lua plugins for increased performance.I have optimized a few different parts of the Oxide core this year while refactoring various things. I am working towards being able to optimize a number of things further in the near future. There is always room for improvement sometimes you just have to get creative.Oxide  itself will not cause any noticeable performance overhead unless you are running a huge number of plugins which are utilizing many intensive hooks. The resources plugins may use are however not limited so plugins can easily cause performance issues if they are not implemented with sufficient optimization for your server hardware and player count.You should be careful with the plugins you choose to run monitor your servers frame rate and pay attention to any frequent Oxide plugin time warnings.Best place to start out with plugin development is on the Oxide forums there are many active plugin developers there.I hope this clears up any confusion.,playrust,crqxw4k,2,t5_2xks2

4151023,0,t1_crt8emq,While you have a point about the impossible combined smeltingcrafting time of C I wish they have a series of appliances that reduces that by  saying it only takes  metal fragments to defeat that is not accurate.Consider that the smallest fullyarmored fullyenclosed room is not a single wall but  walls  foundation  ceiling  door. Thats  armored units or  metal fragments. For a bigger base the cost is exponentially more expensive while it stays linear for the C raider.So in the end it will only be worth it to build a x safe room with double doors in the middle of your stone base.Since doors might be easier to destroy base building will go back to legacy days where the best base is a balance of number of doors and complexity of bases.,playrust,crtfif9,6,t5_2xks2

So you find a stock a barrel the body of the gun or whatever the magazine the sights etc and cobble something together at a work bench. They can make a huge number of compatible parts so there is nearly endless variety. And they could make it so you have to find the parts rather than craft them so guns would be a bit more rare. This would also encourage trading if you found a part that you have no use for but someone could use it to improve their gun. And then they should let us paint our guns.

Second  i am not suggesting to make and MMO i suggesting to make survival game And Bethesda can handle this very well because their worlds are WAY much better then their stories so making a game without story should be perfect for them just as Rust but with Bethesda power they can achieve in one year more then any current survival game developer can do in their entire life because they are not an indie studio and can develop very fast with high quality of product.

Not only does this nearly double the resource cost but it is currently also very tricky to upgrade all of the pillars once the adjacent walls are in place. The common design of antiladders overhangs  pagodas is an easy example. If you wish to have an overhang above the th level you will need to use and upgrade both pillars and supporting walls.Suggestion Increase the base stability values for all construction pieces or at least pillars.

Rinse repeat.Sometimes it would freeze when I clicked play on the window that pops up to select graphics quality and screen resolution and sometimes it would do it before.I decided to just purge everything and uninstall steam and then reinstall it.

4586489,0,t1_ct8ot2k,I agree. The AR platform is the allaround best option in the game because that equates to real life comparisons. Maybe make the AR cost more metal or cloth or you have the have prerequisite items built to make it. For example tiers of crafting tables and you need the top tier to make advanced weaponry. That will bog us down some and make us work harder to make weapons. And clans would still be able to gear up quickly it just prolongs server life. And gives fresh spawns time to hear.But I think we should address the fresh spawn issue. Learn to play. The learning curve is steep to start because you have to figure out the hard way how to spread yourself out to multiple bases and do suicide rad runs to get gear. TLDR  Yes tweaks can always be made to make the game better. But its much more enjoyable to tweak your gameplay than to complain.,playrust,ct8q569,1,t5_2xks2

I played wow for many years and it is certainly not the kind of experience I am seeking in rust. However some RPG elements would give the experience some more depth. I dont understand how it being a survival game has anything to do with me not liking the grind for gearbps? that is a very non sequitur argument. You talk about chance being a big part of life well in the same vein so is education knowledge and experience. In real survival situations where ppl who had limited knowledge of how to survive had to begin improvising and using creative thinking to solve problems and accomplish goals. A lot of times human experience is trial and error.

5126332,0,t1_cv3wkoa,Im trying to use a bayesian style analysis and youre getting all aggro which is your style.  Just work with me hereHeres ARK  A  decrease this last month so maybe it is a back to school thingThe thing is that Rust used to have a player base similar to ARKs and ever since the reboot it hasnt.If the game keeps getting better and better and new features are added shouldnt the playerbase for an EA game not see such a dramatic drop?Please if you think the development is going well just say so dont be so damn contrary and just point out the obvious like most games experience player base drops.  Not many games that are in active dev have experienced a drop of over  from their heyday like Rust.Yes the Reboot had a huge huge part in that but also the game is not gaining players outside the one huge bump they got from a few people streaming it back in May.  Id argue that THANK GOD a few really popular streamers did that back in May because that is what brought the popularity up but IMO youre seeing a slow drip back to less and less players once again.,playrust,cv3wykh,0,t5_2xks2
5129409,0,t1_cv3xizq,I disagree with this fella i prefer rust over ark in terms of pvp because i like the weapon feeling and the feeling when you hit someone i cant explain it i just like rust better but rust is way behind the ark. No pve content. More fps issuesmy computer is old and and ark ran better at lowest settings. Much more end content than rust. Actually the surroundings are dangerous. In rust you never die to pve content if you have  hour of playtime. In ark you get hungry hot get faint from exhaustion get bones broken and on and on. I can go on for a day about ark being superior to rust but ill sum it up with a sentence. ARK IS A SURVIVAL GAME RUST IS A COUNTERSTRIKE WHERE YOU CAN CRAFTAND BUILD A HOME WITH MINOR SURVIVAL ELEMENTS.Ps Sorry boys i played rust for many hours last year rust was the best fukin experience ive ever had. But other survival games surpassed rust in many elements the game develops very slowly. I know some of you will be angry with me but face the truth it is far behind the other survival games.  ,playrust,cv4ab1t,4,t5_2xks2

5331591,0,t1_cvt52ij,gt I can know that a loop is looping more than it should because in order for a memory leak to happen too much memory is being used without being returnedHeres some pseudo code that loops exactly the same amount of times its meant to but has a memory leak.    void frameint tickCount   called once every game tick        forint i   i lt playerCount i             AnimFrame  playerAnimFrame  new AnimFrametickCount  Get animation frame for this tick            playersi.animFrame  playerAnimFrame              Whoops! We never called delete on the AnimFrame. We looped exactly the number of times we meant to but never freed the memory.gt the idea for this type of data structure was inspired by the physical stack which is why it has the same name and the same qualities including the abstract addresses being called registers. I dont think youre realizing the difference between the two.The stack is a completely separate concept from registers. I think you got confused when you were taught turing machines. The simplest type uses a stack. It is possible to implement a turingcomplete computer using a stack alone.However many modern computers also use registers. These are a separate concept. Registers allow the computer to do things like pipelining.PCs do not have  or  registers. These registers are not filled up like a stack is. You do not push or pop data to registers you just overwrite what was already there. Registers and the stack are separate concepts.gt Execution time latency and CPU time are two different concepts. You are referring to either the latency or perhaps the execution time. The CPU core doing the address loading is only active for a small amount of clocks it then goes idle. The execution time and latency both depend on many factors including physical distance between the CPU and memory this time is generally measured in a large relatively speaking amount of nanoseconds.I dont care. This is irrelevant. I just said a computer typically takes several hundred cycles to load from main RAM. Obviously the computer isnt  being utilized in that time Im just saying that typically a CPU can do hundreds of operations while waiting for memory to arrive so it can often be a huge bottleneck.gt memory cannot be lost in the manner you are referring toIts lost in the sense that the software cant find it has no reference to it yet its not been freed yet. The software doesnt think it can use it and the OS doesnt think it can use it either so nobody has it.Its not literally or physically lost its just a phrase.gt its just looking at a memory location. A circular reference can be used in combination with other instructions to retrieve data which could then put that data retrieval instruction through a long enough loop that it would cause a memory leak.Stop taking my wording so literally. Yes a circular reference as in the  literal sense of  pointers pointing towards each other isnt really an issue. When combined with a garbage collector that cant free memory due to this circular reference it IS an issue.gt Its a some number of voltages up to  in modern computers each being stored within a flipflopNope. DRAM doesnt use flipflops only SRAM cache memory on the CPU does.gt Youre suggesting these flip flops can somehow leak which they cannot.When did I say that? Please mark where I said that memory literally and physically leaks out of the hardware because I dont remember ever implying that even in the loosest sense.gt Things do slip through the cracks those are called bugs a memory leak is a type of bug a pretty big one.Yes but Unitys garbage collector works on thousands of games most of which dont have any memory leaks.gt The graphics card contains both the GPU and its own RAM. As the name implies it processes and stores graphics memory. A circular reference can happen here or in the CPU it is not exclusive to graphics.Ive never even mentioned the graphics card. What are you talking about?gt youve made some mistakes that a better educated in this field and this field only person would generally not makeOn the contrary youve stated many mistakes which are obviously and  untrue and easily proven to be untrue  for example claiming that a modern PC has  registers. This isnt something that can be misunderstood by context etc its just plain wrong.,playrust,cvt65he,1,t5_2xks2
5331689,0,t1_cvt3m3x,You do understand that he is fully aware of this issue and that is why he is going to work on extending the midtier gameplay right? For starters how would getting rid of the guy who will be working on midtier gameplay fix midtier gameplay? Two the bow was never supposed to be as good as it was and anyone who played legacy knows this well. Now my view on lowmid tier troubles     The problem with lowmid tier is that there arent any weapons in said tier that are worth using except maybe the revolver. Lowmid weapons include a plethora of good mele weapons swords some shit mele spears  shotguntype weapons that are very environment specific  repeating pistol the crossbow a slower slightly more powerful version of the bow and the bow the cheap fastrepeatinghighdamage weapon youd be an idiot not to use. The bow needed a nerf because it is not the weapon you should be using when there are actual firearms as an option but the unfortunate fact is that it is the only weapon worth using in that tier for the most part. The guns of the lowmid tier arent anywhere powerful enough to deal with midtier players let alone endgamers with good armour and AKs. This is where Helk comes in. He said he will look into ways lowmid tier gameplay can be extended and improved. Maybe new firearms that carry a high damage and the accuracy to deal with armoured players. Maybe a compound bow that will be a more legitimate version of the old bow. Regardless What I am trying to get across is that I agree with you  that lowmid game needs work but what you are saying is just far too shortsighted for anything productive to be taken from it. Helk is going to work on this and from what hes done in the past I dont see why we cant trust him to get it done right. ,playrust,cvt6loi,1,t5_2xks2

I knew dozens of people that put in tons of hours into Legacy not  of them thinks the game feels good now and the weapons feeling like crap is issue   You finally listened to people and made the bullets A LOT faster and hitscan now I guess? but the lazy aim has either got to go or it needs to be greatly reduced because old Rust didnt feel like total poop like this does now.

So an admin cant spawn a bunch of these and then list them on the steam store but an admin could give the bp to its players so they wont have a need to buy them from the steam store.

A big group has easier access to a monument nothing wrong there. The balancing factor was a solo player could go into a rad town and find a gun and be on even terms now not in numbers but fire powerWith this change however now a big group has easier access to the weapon.  The bad part is now the bigger group has quicker access to getting the weapons repaired and ready for use.So before we could be tommy vs tommys.  Now its bowspear vs tommys when it comes to big groups.This change will not affect big groups hardly at all and really slow down the solo player.,playrust,cwpgrv1,6,t5_2xks2

5606332,0,t1_cws082o,Youre right theres a lot of bad suggestions but even those suggestions have a problem at the root of them even if the suggestion isnt the solution. A good example of that is when people suggest an automated wood gathering machine or the ability to plant trees within a compound.  Wood farming is obviously the only thing stopping large clans steam rolling their way through a server in hours its the only resource that has to be gathered manually.   On the face of it the suggestion looks like a lazy players wish for an easier game at the expense of the overall server balance but the root cause is that resource gatheing manually is a monotonous skill less time sink for all players not just lazy compound campers.,playrust,cws0psx,3,t5_2xks2

5632980,0,t1_cwvbd3t,A grouping system at its core allows the developers to distinguish in code who is a friend and who is not.  The whole point of the tool cupboard is to prevent permagriefing.  With the grouping system the developers can automatically control who can and cannot build within a certain radius.Moreover OP suggested that raiding deployables like ladders and satchel charges should still be able to be placed by nonmembers going even further to describe other items like wall spikes to prevent ladder placement and mentioning that these raiding items should be easily removed.A grouping system doesnt go against the very nature of Rust.  I have been playing Rust since legacy when they had zombies.  People play in groups anyway.  If you are a solo player then I suspect that you have an emotional predisposition to ignore anything to do with groups.,playrust,cwvboxn,1,t5_2xks2
5633008,0,t1_cwv9wn8,gt That statistic says nothing about multiple infractions by the same person so its an invalid defence to your argument that a person who cheated once will most likely cheat again.i dont know why you deny this argument its pretty solid in my view. most of cheaters will cheat more than once. i know not everyone is constantly cheating but its a fact that some cheater will  cheat more than once regardless if they are caught or not. having a  VAC ban show that they cheated once. so by definition some of people with VAC ban will cheat again. it doesnt mean that people with clean account will never cheat it only say that someone with a VAC ban might maybe will cheat again.gt But im not asking you to change it couldnt care less about your server.This thread is about those servers who have a noVAC ban rule. again im not really sure what youre trying to say tthats what the discussion is about here. Having a rule to permaban all cheaters is more likely to project a rigid approach and let people know that it will be taken care seriously. ,playrust,cwvbtfh,1,t5_2xks2

From what i can tell its a VERY specific part of the map for instance on my server its in the desert somewhere  me and some friends were walking around looking for a place to raid my two buddies were walking right next to eachother and both DCd I walked up to their bodies and the same thing happened to me. Fast forward maybe like  or  days I try logging on again and it finally let me log in I assume someone killed me and friends from afar I curiously walked back to the exact  spot to see if my or my friends bodies were still there but i didnt remember the EXACT area walked around a bit where i thought my buddies would be and BOOM disconnected again currently waiting for it to let me finally log in again. Someone probably has to kill me or something.As far as I can tell looking for the problem on forums and stuff it doesnt seem to happen on official servers so it probably has something to do with Oxide or something to do with the mods on those servers.,playrust,cx4369q,1,t5_2xks2

My thread title was a bit concise so Ill explain my logic. I dont mind that stacking was removed in the game however an earlygame consequence of this is the abundant need of small boxes to place resources. I believe the earlygame would be much better if we had access to shelves as a default BP because it would remove the clutter of countless small boxes scattered about a single floor tile. ,playrust,cxnynti,5,t5_2xks2

5885220,0,t3_3vtdjr, you dont need a large base learn to build compact and smart. the key thing is the actual base is small use all your extra ressource to build triangle honeycomb aroud it.     never let your enemy know your main base location.     make your house looks abandonned if possible.     hide important ressource and cupboard in location not common. for example your main cupboard could be in a stone x outside your house in a way that raiding that particular cubpoard would not seem to get any advantage for the raider by leaving the other side of hte house without external x cupboard for example. so if the raider would want to tower your house they would have to either raid that x cubpoard and build a tower on that side or simply tower the other side of the house which doesnt require to raid any x cupboard. of course towering on top of your house would not give them any advantage the loot is on the first floor in a corner hidden in the honeycombs.      if you shoot someone from your rooftop you increase you chance of waking up on the beach tomorrow.

5941041,0,t3_3wq1rw,Very good advice. any base larger than a x can be towered on top. there is no point in building a xx base with the lootroom on top because     . if you toolcupboard is in the dead middle someone can stand just outside the nobuild zone build a twig tower and jump on top bypassing all your lower level.     . if you build x cupboarrd around your base to prevent towering well the raider will just spend c  steal that cupboarrd then tower on. its possible to build a x with cupboard in the corners which will prevent towering but then your cupboard are just  walls away from being stolen so its risky. your best bet is to not build tower and just build triangle foundation. dont build your lootroom in the dead middle of your house since its where raiders always go. ,playrust,cxyefpj,1,t5_2xks2

Garry talked about how he wants to focus on getting the core mechanics of nuRust onto the same level as Legacy but instead theyve added attack helicopters rocket launchers and ms. The building system feels like patchwork in a bad way and the base meta has moved from reasonable bases to acres of walled off land and multiple massive buildings. It sucks cause I know Garry is a good dev I know he wants to improve the game I just dont feel it yet.There were a few moments in new Rust history where I felt the game coming together and I thoroughly enjoyed myself. Notably before the drillspumps and helicopters were added. This was also back when the rocket launcher was relatively useless in destroying structures. ,playrust,cyjb9w7,18,t5_2xks2

6137090,0,t3_3zm47n,Me and my friends have owned servers for multiple games since we were pretty young. Its not as easy as buying a server. Firstly it doesnt really matter if you are fair or good admins. being a good admin is step .You need to build a playerbase by playing get all your friends everyone you know to come join you. If you have  people on most of the time eventually people will join. Some people quit some people enjoy the server and stay.Over the next few months this happens until you have solid active players who join regularly.The next thing that matters is how you market the server. Who are you appealing to? are you trying to be a battlefield server? medieval rust? plain ol vanilla?Overall the best thing to remember is this normally is a very slow process. We already have servers with  active admins who are amazing and have a regular playerbase of hundreds if not thousands of unique players such as rustified or rustopia. What it comes down to is if you really want to do this is that you understand its not just hey we have a server now people will join. Itll take weeks months to obtain a playerbase and youll have to support and play on the server and get friends in possibly post on message boards like reddit and the like advertising all the time until it pays off. We already have hundreds of servers that are vanilla beautifully modded or themed with amazing admins and active playerbases. Just have to find out what sets you apart.,playrust,cyn80tx,5,t5_2xks2

6157014,0,t3_3zvrd3,I usually play solo but I can vouch for the fact that  people will open up a lot of the game to you this is actually why I only play solo I like the difficulty and autonomy. I recommend making acquaintances with the largest guilds if you plan on playing on a big server. Even if they arent allied to you and youve only done some trades or helped them with something it can help when you need people in order to do something that solo players cant.Starting solo on a smaller server will be helpful to you as you will have a better chance at getting the hang of things before moving up to big servers. For bases I generally will hide a bunch of these guys   Note I forgot campfires are kinda null bc furnaces cook food now still?Made on kentbakkoffers.comRustPlanner You can hide them in a bundle of bushes behind cliff edges or just in a valley next to a rock or something. They have a pretty tight fit so you can do a lot with it. Sure its extremely difficult to defend but as a solo player you wont be playing defense usually.Once you have more resources worked up you can do a  story tower with a floating staircase that you have to build up each time with twigs. This is strong except against raid towers so youll want to have TC outposts or build a little village of dummy houses and make the tower look like a decoy.,playrust,cyphkzb,3,t5_2xks2

If an admin want to build events an arena or give himself gear to kill people with his friend he is free to do but players deserve to know what kind of server this is. Some players are okay with having adminbuilt house filled with prize loot or serverwide event like fighting arena and there are servers for it. Some other players want a clean server with no admin intervention except to ban hackers and glitchers. Admin abuse is a major problem. For months it was impossible for me to find a community server of more then  players where the admin didnt cheat. every time it was the same i would join one of the few server with a ping ltms. after  weeks invested in this server i would find proof of admin spawn items stack of  bullets for example. ,playrust,cz3jwb0,2,t5_2xks2

The reason being when people shoot at youattack they tend to aim at your head or body.

That is literally an hour that I could not play that would make my gameplay horrible. Most people would not use it for roleplay or anything of that nature they would just handcuff and ruin your gameplay. Or handcuff you during a raid and then you cant even defend your base.If they put handcuffs in I think they should let you suicide. It would still lead to plenty of fun moments as the captor knows that you cannot kill him or anything else. That way the event would be much more balanced in terms of enjoyment.

They only selected smart and capable people for the experiment thats why blueprints exist.The chopper is sent to monitor and stabilize the population.

6540799,0,t3_4582oq,I completely agree. I know the devs have avoided excessive trees as it hugely reduces performances  but I dont think the solution is just to clear the map  the solution should be to fix the performance issues with the trees.Design trees with a low poly count design the foliage so that there is not a huge amount of Alpha information being transferred. Allow players to heavily reduce graphics settings on demanding aspects like trees  so that players with less capable rigs that play with a steady FPS.But I completely agree  currently on official I will run for  rock node  farm it  then run back and store the resources due to multiple huge bases surrounding my base  with players camping on top with bolties shooting people trying to farm.The experience isnt very dynamic like this.,playrust,czvve23,68,t5_2xks2
6542847,0,t3_452c7x,No matter how huge your base is especially vertical wise it can downed to the floor easily.I could give a really long example but in truth its just not more efficient and you know that. Game developers should not change game mechanics because someone doesnt know how to think about design properly.If you want to build a narrow tower Im not going to be retarded and C every door on the way to the top. Raiding is costly you go for the path of least resistance.If your foundations are your weak point upgrade them to armored. In my house design Ceilings are my weak point of choice because they are cheap to upgrade to armored.Given the current state of rockets splash damage you can take more than one foundation at a time.Sometimes but if you design your base against that you cannot.People also use this raiding method most of the time for griefing which is something that devs generally dont like.Garry cares more about giving players in his game freedom its kind of like his personal belief xDPossible solution? Now Im fine with the rockets splash damage. Just double the health of foundations. A possible solution would be to upgrade your foundations design a better house or add a lair of foundations to more than double the already less efficient raiding method of foundation raiding.Reality is that your just mad that you got raided because you thought you were so safe that high above but when you came back to earth reality kicked in and you didnt like it.

6549119,0,t3_45brfm,What I dont understand is why you arent able to reproduce the bluescreen error. If it was a pure memory problem you should be able to play fine until the game tries to access a broken part of your memory again and then produce the same BSOD again. Since you arent getting any bluescreen I dont think its memory related anymore.I think you might be having two seperate problems. As in Broken memory which you might or might not have fixed by now and an unrelated software problem which keeps Rust from running properly in the first place.I suggest instead of using Linux you upgrade to Win. Its not that bad after all. See what happens. Dont forget administrator mode for both Rust and Steam.  ,playrust,czwqdvw,2,t5_2xks2

Are you playing a  or  week wipe cycle? Are you playing vanilla or modded? Are you playing a high pop server and if so why? Youre not going to raid every base on the server solo so find a server that has a lot of random new players like the reddit playrustpublic. There are clans but theres always new players joining and everyday there will be a ton of easy to raid bases even for a solo player. Or go play modded for higher gather but anyone who is teamed up will have more mats and harder bases to raid.Put a small x by each of the radtowns to bounce around to so you can farm bps.

6671570,0,t3_4714ur,Rustafied  Rusty Moose  Rustopia servers are good in my experience.Rusty Moose is a bit looser because the admins fly around often invisible but sometimes they forget to raidcam capture some player action or catch people cheatingexploitinghaving rock bases.  The admins are also very open to talking with people via chat which can be fun but they dont actually play on the server except a few times Ive heard of them making bases for events near the end of a wipe cycle.  This one is pretty solid as they dont seem to have any hugelarge clans solo player groups seem common here.  Also several active admins which is pretty awesome.  Beware they will ban for racism!  a popular theme is everyone says bye as soon as someone says nigger in any way usually while mad after some death.  I really like here the best so far the Rustafied low pop server come in a close second.  Not sure what the wipe cycle is.Rustafied has no admins who actually enter the game but they will respond to people cheatinghacking if you Steam them.  This is probably the closest youll ever get to the vanilla experience but still no hacks or weird admins.  Id recommend it though they have a weird server spectrum where the main server has  people but  has large clans and wipes weekly too often imo and the low pop server has  people I like playing here but has small player groups and wipes monthly a bit too sparsely imo.  If they had a biweekly one they would be totally set.I personally never played on Rustopia but Ive never heard anything bad there except maybe big clans.These servers are vanilla however.  Not sure if thats what youre looking for.,playrust,d09ec1v,6,t5_2xks2

6765273,0,t3_48cb6i,Built a base for a  person clan on a low pop server at the start of a cycle the next day my groups base was surrounded by two massive compounds. One the dank clan with about  members and the other was the dk clan which was  members. Instead of an arms race all  of us teamed up and dominanted that server it was fun. Once that cycle ended we all joined a higher pop server and based together but the danks turned out to never get on much and were all new to the game. And the dks turned out to be real dicks expected there was this massive  man clan btk that the former dks were always instigating shit with they never wanted to farm and expected us to grind out materials one point calling me their bitch while they ran out and died with our supplies over and over messing with the huge clan. Eventually btk found out where our base was but they couldnt manage an online raid so they just built some watch tower thing and waitied for us to go offline. Knowing that it was dlks fault and none of the danks were on my original group of  started moving our supplies into a secret base only we knew about. We told dk that we knew were btks base was and me and  others led them to the end of our valley. All meanwhile our th had destroyed dks beds killed all the sleeping danks and changed the locks not that itd had mattered because the base was doomed to be raided and all loot had been moved prior but we took them to an empty xbase where I described it as a old yeller scene as we gunned down all  of them while banning them one by one from the teamspeak.

Ongoing improvements to the netcode and engine that bring a raise in frames are good but there is no point ploughing hundreds of man hours into optimization now. There is nothing to say that in a few months they wont have a new shader system or something they wish to place in the game that will ruin all that work. The real heavy optimization should take place at the very end of the dev cycle. This counts double for this game where the Unity system it is built on is still seeing major updates and changes. Also this game might be not released for a few years. They have to work based on it running on high end machines now so that by the time it comes out it will work on average computers.

We ended up near a base and I heard a ladder hatch open a close so we got close to the base and started camping it and I started talking in procs like I was a noob and he had a repair bench in his base part of his base looked like someone raided half of it and left and he was in the non raided part of the base and I was asking him how it worked why I couldnt repair my rock and torch like acting like a complete idiot and asking really noob questions he ended up explaining how to play the game where to live where to avoid on the map I asked him about some landmarks that Ive seen on  YouTube and he was telling me who owned them and shit like that meanwhile in our ts we were all like  this guy is way to fucking nice to fuck him over like this I dont think we can do this dude and then I told him plain out yeah dude Im not really a noob I have have k hours played and was trying to bait you out of your base to kill you but we are new to the server he was like oh uhmmm thanks for telling me haha and I said  yeah sorry man youre just way to nice dude to do this too after a we were about to go and he offered us his base and let us change the codes to his doors while he was going to make us some guns cause he was about to get off.

Garry probably already knew at least one language already when he started using Unity. If he did so after he made Gmod then he definitely knew at least C. Ive heard that once you learn one language its easy to learn others because all you have to learn is the syntax differences.I dont use Skype really. It refuses to recognize my headset among other things. Reddit is the best way to contact me because Im on here multiple times a day.There wont be any dungeons. The reason for that is one of the aspects where it deviates from Rust its set in the Stone Age. Hence the primitive weapons and naturalonly structures.

6943209,0,t1_d12t87k,The HQM update for example only reduced the amount that solosmaller groups could obtain large groups with more hours per day play simply gained even more of an edge. On their already massive edge to begin with  Some players For example a player who can only play say few hours every few days is effectively locked out.  HQM is more time hitting rocks X risk of being out then say the  frags it use to be or whatever.So it did not enforce rarity as much it just actively prevented the less hard core everyday hours a day player from having their chance to be effective in PvP reduced.  Under the premise If guns are rare! There will be more midgame.  Yet here we are months after HQM and quarries and midgame is exactly the same something that happens like on wipe day or too poor bastards who switch servers midwipe. Maybe I should just state upfront that Im entirely capable of entertaining a perspective of my own which some of you on this sub seem to actively refuse.  Like Ive stated in other posts Im done with the circular argument.  Vanilla is moving towards more grind then Ill just play modded because I like the game I like the base concepts and ideas I think it has potential.

7330965,0,t1_d2begi4,You was right... Devblog . Now i got my answer. Thanks for support.Skin ChangesA few changes in the item store. A bunch of items that werent really selling anything have been removed from sale  but theyre still randomly dropped.The Tempered AK has been removed from the item store but still random drops. This is probably a bit confusing. At the moment workshop skin creators dont get paid on market transactions they only get paid on direct item sales this is a limitation on the inventory system. This is the only good reason we sell these skins on the item store.So when we set a price in the item store were really setting the ceiling price. The idea being that almost noone will pay the ceiling price if theres a cheaper one on the marketplace. This doesnt always work out for some reason. Ideally we want the ceiling price to be defined by the market conditions  not by us. It feels like this skin has had a good run  its made a decent return for its author it has sold  copies at . The hope is that by not selling it in the item store it will get quite rare again so the secondary market can get value from it. It will be interesting to see whether it will get expensive again. Will people treasure it as much as when they knew it was  to buy on the item store?,playrust,d2bhbfw,1,t5_2xks2
7333131,0,t3_4fsvwv,Theyre pretty similar in performance  can perform better in some scenarios cos of the whole nvidia ram thing where mb isnt available to the game for the most part. But nvidia draw less power arguably better support and the bog standard card runs coolerquieter. But the  is cheaper performs slightly better but draws way more power and is slightly louder but you can get different models with more fans and fit after market coolers. I went with the  cos it was on sale over christmas and noise isnt a problem for me and neither is power. I dont think the support is anyway worse never had a problem with drivers and games with winows . or win . Im also a Itnetwork tech guy in a college that has built a few hundred machines if that helps at all. My experience isnt with education purely hands on and working on computers in some way most my life. I have colleagues who would argue either side of the camp it depends on what you value you most.

All .NET languages can be decompiled back into their original code if not obfuscated before compile. Because of this we can decode the dlls that come with the game. If you are familiar with C you can decompile and have a look over the game code and find your answers. I will not post here on how these hacks specifically work.

Destiny wants special treatment. Doesnt matter how famous you are if you play that shitty people are going to wreck you especially on popular servers like rustopia etc.Only reason destinys false claim got so many up votes was because of anti Bchillz and Trausi circle jerking.

7802034,0,t3_4m6uja,You have to realize with the addition of rocks trees and bushes everywhere the game is almost designed in this guerrilla warfare type of environment where combat happens  times out of  in close range rather than far distances like in Legacy. So the Pipe and crossy combo is the meta for this entire game at its current state and will worsen as the game gets more shotgunsgets more trees rocks and shit to work with.

Youre picking sticks up off the ground exclusively in HW til you can make your first set of tools. Thats why I was fond of keeping that stuff. The only other items I really liked keeping was the bow Still had to make new arrows and the backpack which doubles your inventory space. Keeping clothes was handy because of the threat of frostbite and heatstroke but if these mechanics are not present in Rust it wont matter.

A couple weeks ago I thought I may be able to get a little more life out of the card before saving up to replace it by reapplying thermal paste on the gpu so I pulled it out of my computer and took it apart. Im pretty consistent in removing dust buildup in my computer but I didnt notice a large amount under the plastic guard of the video card.

7989646,0,t3_4on0p6,So I think this is a bit over exaggerated. Take a step back and look at what the current system brings to the table. You have maybe one day of playing  hours for an average player and you can at least count on getting a library BP and everything else of value from frags pages and maybe a book item that you want. Now this is where problems start with the BP system. This means with a group of people in two days chances are you have a stone wall a gate a solid sized base that is easily and very heavily defended base for day two on a server and you have basically now one goal in mind... Get the rest of the libraries which wont take more than another day and youve completed getting everything in the game.At this point what is there to do on day three and four but run around with your guns and gear and destroy people that either A started playing that day and have just about  chance at becoming a major power before they are taken out by groups that have had C since Day  or B have started Day  but play only a bit and have gotten extremely unlucky with Bp RNG and then are stuck to just get raided by groups who have been mega powers since Day . This means that essentially if the server is  days old there is almost no point to playing on it in hopes of catching up to anyone. You will basically be foundraided or killed frequently and stand no chance.  With these few scenarios in mind that Ive brought up there is almost no desire to play in the middle of a week or between BP wipes at all for people who are starting fresh. Now with the EXP System there will obviously also be people ahead that have been playing since day  but there is now a good  day period of time where the majority of people are only running around with melee weapons and bows and around day  guns start to become more frequent and by day   and  you are reaching your end tier of items and thats when heavy warfare begins. Now this feels like the game has been extended for a good reason. Yeah it gives a bit of a grind but there is a very attainable end goal. If you dont take the time to stop build a base fight people in massive epic melee and bow battles and instead are stirring away smacking stones for  hours than sure... It will seem grindy. I think the root of this issue is more at the fact that we are all used to attaining high end gear very quickly. It was even easily attained in Legacy. Now that we are almost forced to play on a single server for  hours before we get the fun murder stuff it leaves a sour taste. But in hindsight I believe its for the better life of the game and the rivalry between players. I feel like its more combat based since mor people are out and about scouring the land and its an immense amount of fun to know that Day  all skirmishes are going to be fought with Bows Melees and maybe water pipes.TLDR The System is not done you are being a bit too critical take a step back and look at what it has help Rust accomplish. Stop grinding and enjoy the primitive raiding murder and interactions with others more than you have before.EDIT Sorry if I didnt wrap up previous points.

8048437,0,t3_4pglk5,Well theres only  weeks left of blueprints.  You should put a bag down near each monument. Then farm fragments and learn the first tier of items. The game will try to not give you a duplicate. Once you learn all of the first tier then farm frags and turn them into pages and learn all of those. Then youll just need the items from the book and library tiers. Hit barrels pick up trash piles and loot boxes. Keep saving up frags and youll get everything eventually. Try and get airdrops. Depending on the monument learn where the weapon crates spawn and youll randomly get weapons which you can save up frags and research if you want. ,playrust,d4kpxbj,1,t5_2xks2
8051227,0,t1_d4l0hk8,Can you explain how it makes it impossible for solo to play?  Currently clans dont level any faster then a solo player.....  As a matter of fact i have found that i have out leveled most clans because they waste time fighting each other and hunting players which sure...gains you resources but does nothing to level you so you can use them.  Meanwhile ive stayed out of the fights for the most part and gathered tons of resources and leveled so when i can make C ill be able to make a ton.  Your logic comes from someone who hasnt spent much time actually playing in the XP system.In current no exp rust i clan of players can unlock every single BP within the first day.... a solo payer cannot if they are truly playing solo.

8064541,0,t3_4pn88l,This feature is still experimental and yes it is kinda heavy right now. Dont use it for now unless you have a really highend machine. We added it for preview only because we have short development iteration cycles and youd be able to have a sneak peek at the result since visually it may be close to final.Performancewise however its very far from final. Pretty much all of the optimizations have yet to be done e.g. right now it renders stuff every frame for the entire island terrain rocks that really only need to be rendered once and updated when the environment changes not players or AI just large scale like rocks or construction.TLDR yes it is slow but it wont be when were done adequate performance cost due in July after optimizations,playrust,d4mj44n,11,t5_2xks2

8089065,0,t3_4pvs9s,I understand the comparison of crossy vs AK. Sure the AK does cost more and is at a significant risk of losing value in a fight vs a crossy. Sure the crossy does have a ridiculous headshot damage output.Im not upset with the current weapon stats but I do find it problematic that someone that is equally skilled with a crossy AND AK while having resources for both still chooses a significantly lower tier weapon while having material means to makerisk both. Every noob that finds a crossbow in a barrel gets those lucky headshots. The problem is that skilled players with resources available for either still chose the crossbow due to damage output just as much as the risk vs reward situation. The RNG is strongly obvious in this game but doesnt seem to be as much of a variable with the crossbow as it does with guns. If you are a solid player and have equal chance to purposefully hit a crossbow headshot as you do a HS with a boltyAK why wouldnt you stack  crossbows in the hotbar? RNJesus is much more forgiving with the crossbow.,playrust,d4pa9oe,2,t5_2xks2

Being able to get on a server collect a few resources and instantly start playing with your friend is a FEATURE. I prefer it to a realistic survival sim which rust is certainly not.It may increase interaction via forcing players to travel but it could decrease the most meaningful and appealing interactions which is playing with friendspeople you meet. I think the fact that if you have any lootgear you want to keep you have to walk is good enough. There just needs to be more reasons to leave your base in general and I think theyre working on it with monuments and the XP system. I dont think removing the bed feature solves that.,playrust,d4r0hox,12,t5_2xks2

Just make damage more predictable and less time to kill that way PVE isnt relied on to take down groups it should be more the players decision if they really hate a group they should be responsible to take care of it with the helicopter idea it would be exploited anyway as people would just use the TC method. The only thing that needs to be changed is increased spawn rate on the heli and airdrops to encourage more PVP encounters. If it was this way it would mean a skilled PVPer can do great damage if he plays his cards right. A way to furthermore prevent the zerging of players that come back to the fight naked or with a water pipe to try and salvage gear that can be hard to defend make it so when you place a sleeping bag you instantly have a timer that is half of the normal one.,playrust,d4waoi6,3,t5_2xks2

8181691,0,t1_d508u93,The post talks about  people participating in it then the numbers that participated for the other side. Thats a decent feat.IDK about you but the usual response in Rust when trying to communicate with people is the generic shut up cuntfgtscrub or something of the like. Its rare that groups converse beyond insults and while spawning people in with blue or red shirts would do the trick its not really the same thing. I mean it is one colour against another then but most dont really treat the skin colour in rust as a determining factor if it was simply red vs blue people would just subconsciously do as they shirt suggests. People would have to make a conscious effort to go against someone because of race. ,playrust,d509ez7,1,t5_2xks2

8301977,0,t1_d5evyfv,This is what those who like the new XP system dont understand. Fundamentals of the game have been changed in a way that severely changes the subgenre of the game. Whether a raider or a potential victim all of your game time was shaped by the possibility and consequences of being involved in PvP. This is no longer true.Prior the the XP update Rust was a Survival PvP game. Virtually all progression in the game was tied directly to inventorylootablestoreable items. In particular duplicate BPs being shareable with friends or vulnerable to being raided is now completely missing. Even learned BPs were indirectly subject to this since if you know a usefulvaluable BP you probably have a few crafted copies stored away in chests vulnerable to being raided and researched.With the XP update Rust is now a Survival MMO with traumainduced memory loss issues. Progression is entirely and unequivocally tied to grinding. Bambibutchery Baloobloodletting Porkypummeling Nemonabbing Thingtorturing Grootchopping Snoopemulating stitchandbitching hidepunching or cosplaying Bob The Builders supplier ... its all still grinding. PvPRaiding offers no direct path to progression other than the value of the materials looted.In both iterations of the game getting killed and then raided with your base fully burned to the ground have the same consequence to the victim a complete loss of materials resources and shelter but the retention of your learned blueprints. The big difference is in the end result for the victor whose gain is reduced to looted items and victory over another player. There is no true progression to be found in PvP even raidlooted materials are less valuable as material abundance has skyrocketed with the focus on gathergrinding. This shift even applies to progression potential unused XP is retained by the victim rather than lost in the form of blueprint fragments.This changes how people behave and the emotions the game evokes. Raids dont produce the same rush. Loss no longer has the same potential to progress your enemy making them even more dangerous. Organizing and executing successful a raid no longer hinders your enemys progression as severely reducing the threat they pose.,playrust,d5fazks,4,t5_2xks2

They need to bring in a designer who can figure out this stuff before they start coding.I dont think there was anything wrong with the BP system. It just needed some additional mechanics and balance. Instead they did very little with it and moved to XP where they have traded one set of issues for another.Better the devil you know than the one you dont. They had a system that was workable but instead of planning out a roadmap to address its flaws they threw the baby out with the bath water and set themselves back by months.Sound familiar?

8395609,1,t3_4umg71,First of all stream sniping is cheating because youre using information obtained outside the game to get an advantage on your opponent. If you have an unfair advantage and you get it outside the game mechanics that is cheating always. Ive never understood why people defend stream sniping other than the fact that they are jealous of streamers because they get paid to have fun Its clear reading your post OP that you are jealous of streamers. Its the same people who defend SWATing... why? Its clearly illegal and a horrible thing to do to a person.. and then go around and blame the victim by saying a streamer should accept it as part of their job.. Its not part of your job its crime thats why you go to jail if you get caught.Here are some key differences between stream sniping and screen peeking on goldeneye. In goldeneye youre all friends and its all in good fun. When someone stream snipes you in Rust its usually some socially retarded weirdo playing racist music over his mic and calling you a faggot.Now I dont get triggered when people harass me in Rust but that doesnt mean Im gonna defend toxic antisocial behavior.

My friends and I jumped on a x modded server the last  nights.  Even that was brutal leveling wise.  I dont know if I can ever go back to a vanilla.  I personally like having to findminecut resources and then building to protect it. I just think its so stupid to run around the map having friends guard me as I collect ALL the barrels boxes cloth etc.  and having everyone use my tools so that one of us can get to a level ton make a gun to defend ourselves.

I dont care if I looksound crazy but I really love your game. Whatever is going on with your lives Like having a baby taking horrible feedback from others that dont deserve exposure or your eyes to even see which I hate because it could manipulate you into changing something that shouldnt but youre strong for stepping back into the community and taking it all.  I wish I could give you a nice full honest input of my opinions and ideas but I feel like that one shitty comment that somehow got exposure and recognition would win over me even though it shouldnt have. My ideas that Ive posted is nearly nothing that I think about Its all just to spark your minds probably what youve already thought about but my ideas are just to give more ideas and have anyone listen on it branch out to come up with something better. Ive rewritten this over  times I just dont know how to put it but its easier to say this but words mean a lot of things so Just know that I think your game is okay and so are you GarryHelk development team. But I can be wrong about all of this the pressure the way you handle things you probably got it all. The game is in alpha like you said youre tough skinned Garry and Helk isnt I can see why you made this post maybe im wrong or right to probably change peoples minds and give them a different perspective of things and hopefully think about what they have to say.

Ill give you an example my current base on Rustopia has  individual loot rooms. Go ahead get my bottom cupboard. I have  cupboards stacked top to bottom. Youll still not have build permission. Oh wait?? you got first cupboard? and second? you still dont have the Alpha cupboard.Alright thats cool if you were smart enough to get my hidden in foundations cupboard. Even if you get cupboard to get all our loot between  individual loot rooms.. you do the math. I should note that it is set up so you cant rocket out two loot rooms at the same time as splash wont transfer over..So lets say you get my cupboard rockets later you can have our loot too.,playrust,d62podf,-2,t5_2xks2

8495316,0,t3_4w0fcz,Blueprints led to exploration. You would explore to find BPs themselves rare items which you could research or other players that you could potentially trade BPs with.I think XP is a great systembut only for buildingrelated items. Which makes sense if you think about it as harvesting raw materials relates directly to building.What doesnt make sense to me is farming nonprimitive weaponry and armor. Thats where I think the whole thing falls apart because it creates this experience arc. Farm a little for a small base and primitive weaponry. Farm a lot for a medium base and medium weaponry. Farm for the majority of the wipe for a large compound and hightier weaponryThe game experience now hinges on the extremity to which you farm which didnt really exist prior to XP. The experience was way more balanced. To me when BP was thriving the game experience felt like this. Farm for a small base.. Trade for light BPs and fortification items.. Explore rad towns and fight groups for rare items to research.. Harvest BP frags from rad towns for researching purposes.It felt like a much more balanced game experience which was diverse and allowed individual users to choose how they played.,playrust,d63grds,2,t5_2xks2

That means that the script itself is unaware of various variables such as the amount of ammunition that is in the gun the players health etc...Short of having another script scrape the screens pixels for the ammo  there is no way for this script to know the amount of ammo. It would need a mechanism to determine the amount of ammo in order to be able to toggle as you say.Due to this it likely that one design flaw of a script with this approach is that it would continue to compensate regardless of actual game conditions.This doesnt mean he wasnt pulling down with his mouse thinking that he had ammo.

So when an official server starts to lose players people will be able to move to another populated server in theory.

8633930,0,t3_4y25fw,This is going to be buried in the mountain of comments but I still would like to chime in.Im sort of in the same boat as you. Im a very friendly player. And so far my experience has been radically different from most things Ive read on here.I have the luck and opportunity to be able to nolife it these days so Ive hit level  in about a week partly due to the abnormally high animal spawn in my area. Im playing with a small group of friends who I gifted the game to so Ive been teaching them although Im basically just less new.I dont want this to turn into a rant so Ill get to the point. I enjoy PvP but I dont enjoy relentlessly killing nakeds or new players. Ive only ever once had a naked attempt to kill me after peaceful communications and that was because I was injured by a bear and he wrongfully thought he could finish me off.Some people get a kick out of killing other weaker players. I only fight geared players and only out of neccesity. For me the most fun is player interaction. I love meeting new people and honest to god probably about  of interactions Ive had have been friendly. I get my kicks out of helping people. Its great to waltz up to some guy wearing burlap building his twig x while Im in full armor with an AK and hear the surprise and relief when he realizes Im not there to kill him. I usually give them tools some low tier guns armored doors a codelock furnace bag and then cover them while they get established so they dont just immediately lose it all. Usually we have a nice talk I get a new friend on steam and I go on my way.Because of this I have a ton of friends on the server and its actually been quite a help. Once when I was being raided a bunch of them showed up in bucket helmets with crossbows to help me defend. I see a lot of dickheads in Rust and I absolutely refuse to cave in and become one. I got killed so many times by geared guy starting out and I vowed never to stoop to that level. But I understand why some people do it and I dont begrudge them for playing the way they want to. Thats the beauty of this game. And if there werent dickheads there wouldnt be any sense of danger and thats half the fun.Anyways if youve found a PvE server that you actually enjoy thats great. But I think you should give a PvP server another try because you really are missing out on a big portion of the game. No other game has given me the shot of adrenaline that this game does when youre defending a raid.If you want some advice just wander around for a while and talk to people. Find a clan see if you can build near them and pay taxes in exchange for protection. Make some friends find a group hell even be a slave for a while to level up and learn the ropes. But this game is all about playing however you want to play so more power to you if youve found a style that suits you.Sorry for the novel and good luck in rust.,playrust,d6kuk15,2,t5_2xks2

Back in legacy a clan couldnt run anything because the people would just rise up and remove the sickness. Like little white blood cells roaming the lands. Seen this happen countless times.Make their life hell like  farcaster said. However you can go even further. First just place your own TCs like  of them around their high traffic area. Then build sniper towers and roof camp them until they come to blow you up. Since it is modded you can just teleport to another sniper tower.

8862657,0,t3_51mbsa,It is and thats how I play since Im solo.  Theyre a gigantic pain in the ass to build but it makes it too much a pain in the ass to raid too.Find an area underwater about  or  stories down with enough room for a x and build up.  The longest part of the build is filling in the floors underwater for stability.  If the water lines up right the first floor above water will be too high to jump into and if your far enough from shore rockets arent effective.  Which means c is really the only option for a raider.Around your base underwater put metal barricades everywhere.  Since you cant put down TCs underwater raiders will have building privilege under your first floor.  This will make it harder to make towers.At this point the only option a raider really has is to level your tower with c and hope he can find all your loot on the ocean floor.I think Ive only been raided like once in  or  months doing this.  And the had to level my tower to do it.  I think that was more revenge than a raid cause I pissed my neighbors off.Bonus you can put doors underwater so you can have a badass underwater entrance into your base.,playrust,d7d60fn,3,t5_2xks2

There are definitely videos I dont agree with him on AT ALL and I can definitely see why someone wouldnt like his personality... but I just kinda write his opinion off and move on.I personally feel like the response to his content and the recent drama has been a bit childish but with some of the Rust youtubers I CAN see why they dont like him From some screenshots that were shown.If youre going to respond I dont think making a parody of Leafy or throwing random memes in the video is the best way to go about it. When you do either of those its a bit hard to take the situation seriously. Leafy is generally terrible at actually making a point and his videos are way too long when hes trying to and throwing memes in the video just makes it hard to care about. It feels like this video in particular was posted on this Reddit so everybody could laugh at Rhinocrunch and just agree with each other that hes a retard. And even if thats not what this video was posted here for it still feels like thats what the majority of users are doing here.But again its we.

9079002,0,t3_54jy61, Days works well because it has so much stuff in both crafting and resources etc.  Rust is very simplified in comparison.  Why does this matter?  Inventory space for one.  In  Days it is a struggle to prioritize what to loot and often you end up leaving stuff you really want behind because you want other stuff even more.  I know this happens in Rust as well but I feel the inventory space pressure and decisions are much more frequent in  Days. Days also has lots of loot areas compared to Rust.  Rust is mostly an open wilderness map.   Days is too but it has lots of big cities and random POIs.  On the average  Days server each player probably has  full cities with more loot areas than a whole Rust server.  Then all these loot areas are protected by zombies which Rust lacks.There is a big difference in resources.  Rust has stone wood metal HQM and sulfur for resources basically.  In  Days just to make bullets you need potassium nitrate coal lead brass casings bullet tips a workshop unless you want to lose half your gunpowder a forge caliper tools and the perks to make various ammo types A version.  To obtain a significant amount of resources for bullets is a lot harder than Rust where you can find rocks all over the map.  In  Days you would need to mine to bed rock in three different biomes find them first too! and the only way to get specific things like brass or calipers is looting calipers can be very hard to find.TLDR  Both are good games but they are also completely opposite in their focus PVE and PVP.  PVP in  Days is frankly garbage.  I wouldnt mind seeing a lot of  Days systems in Rust to be honest but right now Rust doesnt have the PVE side or content to support it.  Ive played hundreds of hours of Rust and  Days BTW.,playrust,d835d2f,2,t5_2xks2

This SUCKS DICK because there is now only one way to really progress hit things with tools or hunt retarded AI bears. XP can be fixed by tying XP gain into research. you research items higher lvl then you and you gain XP and have a small early unlock  chance based on your level and the items level plus how many times you have researched that item previously.This ties PVP back into gaining levels puts value back on items and instantly creates a game economy even stronger than it used to be.

Just waiting for someone to come back and check their traps as you ever so slowly bleed would be interesting.  The other side of that is that if the traps also shot off a flare or smoke signal or something visible from a long way off would be interesting.  That way you never know what you may find.  Is it a defenseless pig or a rival clan member armed to the teeth?  Then you have a decision to make... do you approach and taunt them until they bleed out or do you get into a gunfight with a decided mobility advantage?

Also for all those omg but clans get this x??!?!?! having reduced visability would actually help solo players.Example situationYou sneak up on a group of  who decided it would be a bright idea to farm trees in the middle of a raging blizzard. Since the tempreture is so horrendous they are wearing jackets and beanies to deal with the cold. But since its actually that bad all  guys are still on  temperature and so they are sitting on  health and cant med since they want to save meds for a fight. Also since the noise is so much due to the weather its easy pickings. Headshot one with a p twice drop the guy. The rest scatter in blind panic but you have complete controll of the situation allowing you to hunt down maybe  or  others before the last one escapes.The result? Potentially k wood if they had been farming for a while. If not free snow jacks which equal potentially  cloth depending on the amount of guys you kill and loot.,playrust,d8h73sa,1,t5_2xks2

9527861,0,t3_5bcmzs,These are some interesting ideas especially the mould mechanic but i think the ability to craft many of the components would defeat the purpose. If you made rope craftable with say  cloth the number doesnt matter  rope would become a redundant material. Why have rope when you can find hemp bushes. Both are randomly occuring and both would play an identical function but one would be farmable. Theres no point in making a crafting system where you use an multiple of one ingredient to craft another ingredient.Crafting of some components might make sense if you cross mix materials e.g. rope is made of hemp  wood? Again specific ingredient isnt important. However i dont think this would help either. The point of the components system is to make people explore and interact rather than hiding as much as possible and doing menial isolated tasks like in xp. Making components craftable from the basic readily accessible materials woodstone etc would promote insular gameplay and linear gameplay. It would also break the slowed progression formed by conponents. You have more people? Do more menial tasks for more time and you win. Whereas in components they are at least slowed by the rng of component finding.The mould system and a crafting station sounds interesting though so Id like to see more on how that would work. Would you have multiple or just one crafting station? And would each weapon have a mould or would they be class sorted?,playrust,d9nidrq,2,t5_2xks2

9635909,0,t3_5d070e,Ive put  hours in on the system and I just cant get behind not on vanilla at least.It doesnt level the playing field.  It took away my one real advantage as a solo  and duo and that was wielding an AK in a flank or counterraid scenario coupled with an insane ability to grind nodes for sulfur.  Me and my partner usually would get AKs just like big clans ever the first day.  We knew how to use frags the table and rad runs to get the guns we needed so we could at least have a chance to compete against bigger groups.Countless times we were able to fend off online raids on wipe day and weekend because we had AK and bolts.Now we play for  hours and can make a couple pistols and a maybe one bolt at best.The armored door  HQM hit us in the nuts as well.  We dont like to build high because we cant be on all day to defend a huge target.  So we usually would build smart and make raiders weave their way through our base  not anymore.At HQM per door after a day of play unless we dont want to make any guns we are just stuck with  or  armored doors between the zergs and us.its hard man and honestly the fun moments are so far in between the grind that it just doesnt feel like the same game.progression was a part of rust always.  Now its not.  Legacy was fun because you could play however you wanted it was a true sandbox.  You could spawn naked and get a gun within  minutes usually yea you might die constantly but it was a strat.or you could go build way out in the wilderness where nobody was and yea it was a POA to run  minutes to your base you could also as a solo exist mostly without fear of being raided.or if you had  or or more you could try and hold down a resource hole.  Or you could go farm rad animals to try and tech up or get a metal building part.Now you are basically just forced to grind.  You grind for a small existence.  The only change they need to do is put fucking guns in boxes make boxes spawn like in legacy aka not just in crazy rad zones remember TANKS! and stop making everything fun cost so much damn HQM.Clans that get an HQM quarry going have such a massive advantage now I mean FP has to have some data on how much HQM is being mined and I would hazard a guess that great that  totally produced on any given high pop server is via quarry.sigh.  Ill probably get downvoted.  Ive been positive about the game lately but this scarcity of guns shit just kills me.  I miss the AK fights.  I miss when people roamed with bolts and you could pipe them in the back.I mean that shit is basically rare as fuck now.  Its  SAR and P fights between  groups and nakeds.  Thats what Im seeing.  The clans arent even fighting each other because why?  Better to just take from the small groups and its hard for even a clan to raid a base that takes  rockets.,playrust,da0tp9f,6,t5_2xks2

9707752,0,t3_5e30qq,I agree that they should do something about the despawn time but Im not sure how it should be implemented.  To keep servers running smoothly you cannot have too many entities in the world.  A global increase in despawn time is probably not going to work so you could increase the despawn time considerably when inside cupboard radius and I think thatd help in most situations where youre raiding and the owners tries to despawn their loot however they could simply destroy the TC or maybe you have the TC already etc.  I think something needs to be done though.  Online raiding is too rare and when they happen it usually ends up in picking up the few bags thats left after theyve despawned everything.,playrust,da9osyy,0,t5_2xks2

The easier it is to get resources means your spending your time crafting in order to keep up with the same amount of people trying to do what you are doing. The difference between is not the ease but rather the time.

9886876,0,t3_5gvsp9,A few things. if you are going to play vanilla rust start on a thursday around PM. That is roughly when the weekly patch hits and most servers will wipe the map so that everyone is at the same level. Get a sheet metal door up and your odds of getting raided are greatly reduced. get an armoured door and your odds are even smaller. Both are possible day . Startup tactics Get a spear. Hit a tree for  wood. This is your basic defense.  Get healed pickup mushroomshunt animals for food. cook at the fire. fill the fire fully with food so that the cooked stuff pops out without burning. Get a sleeping bag.  cloth  wood. on wipe day the  cloth can be an issue so just keep running around until you find it. i usually avoid combat at this stage unless someone is really adamant on killing me.  Place the bag in a bush and craft yourself a wood box. Find a rock that you can place the box in. if you look around you can see that the box can be totally hidden inside certain rocks. you can also use a bush but it is less secure than a rock.This is now your home setup. dump your stuff in the box i usually need  boxes and go get yourself some tools. After you have tools get some nodes some trees and get yourself a tool cupboard. You want around k stone. Place  triangle piece and put the cupboard right in the center. authorize on it then build walls around it. Make sure you block off the top and use the hammer to upgrade the foundation  walls and top piece to stone. This tool cupboard will claim the land you are on and since it is encased in stone people need to spend explosives to get it. This is not gonna happen day . IMPORTANT NOTE Walls have a soft and a hard side. BE SURE THE HARD SIDE ALWAYS FACES OUTWARD! If you have a situation where you placed a wall and the soft side is exposed to enemies upgrade it to sheet metal. this will greatly increase the time it takes to bash it down with tools. Soft sides are smooth hard sides are rocky. also soft sides have an X on them when they are twig.Next build a square box piece off the triangle. Leave a door entrance on the front of it. Off the door build a triangle piece with a door. This is an airlock. it lets you open your door without enemies getting into your loot if they kill you in that moment. if you use a triangle piece for an airlock you can open the outside door and it blocks passage to the inside. this lets you open both doors and shoot outside while making sure enemies cannot enter. Get yourself enough animal fat to craft  low grade fuel. once you have that craft up  wood doors a small furnace and go get all your stuff from your boxes. Place the wood door on the outside with a key lock. make sure you lock this door. You are now safe until someone gets a flamethrower. place your furnace and start getting metal fragments from it. wait til you get  and craft  code locks and  sheet metal door. place the sheet metal on the loot room with code and then go switch the key lock on the outside for a code lock. hole E on the key lock.At this point you have a small shack with a sheet door. From there you can do what you like. PVP make a bigger base whatever you like. I highly reccommend getting yourself a second sheet metal door or  armoured door before you log off but  sheet metal is enough to keep most people at bay for a time.Two serversSavas  client.connect ... Battlefield  client.connect ...Battlefield style servers have kits on spawn increased resource yield and increased loot. its a good way to experiment and have some mayhem.Savas island server is a king of the hill style. Spawn on the beach with a rock there are containers with loot. move inland to get better loot. Its a good way to practice with all the weapons in the game. ,playrust,dawa72u,1,t5_2xks2

Im not saying that I want only crossbow or spears fight there are other weapons as well. Semi automatic rifle p pump shotgun custom smg. You cant play only with good weapons or this game wouldnt make any sense.Rich groups being willing to spend and able to lose some of their top tier gear led to smaller groups and solo players being able to snipe that loot for themselves. Having the best equipment be so rare andor tedious to obtain that its not worth risking on the ground relegates it to the status of roofcamping equipment and little more with the current state of raiding youre hardly likely to be online whenever you get raided making that usage kinda moot.gtYou cant play only with good weapons or this game wouldnt make any sense.Bring back weapon drops from barrels and buff the spear bow and crossbow. Now theres both reason to use these items AND a way to get them easilygtBut Its much better than BPXP where everybody could have a best weapon without putting hard work in it.I dont play Rust for hard work I play it for skillbased combat and fun social interactions with a survivalgatheringbuilding flavouring. If the combat is no longer skill based then the latter are pointless if the latter arent up to scratch then the former loses that flavouring and we may as well play something else. The component system shits on that social interaction widens the gap between low and top tier players regardless of skill and ultimately leaves the game feeling bland.gtBtw. What is grind for you? If smashing  barrels or going to radtown to get a rifle body is a grainding for you you havent played Guild Wars  D.I play OSRS and grind isnt a problem in itself grind is a problem when its endless provides no lasting reward has no variation and actively takes away from the rest of the game. ,playrust,db8b92p,2,t5_2xks2

The catch tho is we could use a new tool to break them down A placable drill that is very loud and will take about  minutes to destroy the wall. The drill can be used multiple times but takes a lot of LGF or maybe even a new type of higher quality fuel. This would give diversity to raiding and make the game all the more spicey... ,playrust,dbag6l9,3,t5_2xks2

10019551,0,t3_5j27hy,The Christmas presents are great and kind of represent my st request if they just had a little better guns in them . . Weapons and ammo added to the barrelcrate loot tables as well as the current loot.  Ammo and Primitive weapons like melee weapons bows  pipes and eokas in barrels more expensive weapons in the rarer crates.. Buffing of most weapons.   Lets start with worst case scenario  Naked with rock vs full gear with ak. The ak damage is fine but if the naked with the rock can headshot the full gear  times with his melee swing he should get the kill.  This means the rock does a minimum of  damage to a metal face mask headshot. Scaling it down it should do  damage to coffee can   damage to clothleather headwear and  hp to a naked head. Having it only do hp damage to a riot gear helmet as a special exception due to the riot gears buff vs melee damage. Right now i will not go into all weapons but i can if you want me to this scenario of the rock vs ak should give this basic idea tho.. Return the road to its former glory  Make it bigger and more defined have all newmans respawn  inside the area that the road encompasses so that no matter which direction they run eventually they get to the road. ,playrust,dbdkqgq,0,t5_2xks2

If something like this were to ever be implemented it would need ammo limits. like enough slots for maybe  rockets top and  ammo also only able to refill ammo slots while landed.

Its just that a P can drop you in  second with the absurd rate of fire for almost no risk.When you go out with an automatic weapon  out of  times you come home with  more Ps and the other time youve lost your gun to a P its just not worth risking it.Id go out with actual guns more often if I had a higher chance of gaining actual guns instead of more Ps after half a box full I dont care anymore.,playrust,dc42i5i,0,t5_2xks2

The ticket I linked is regarding increased costs to building larger but they are waiting to explore this until more options for base defense are available such as the flame or waterpipe turret. I think they could implement increased costs for building now if there were more tiers to upgrade to such as reinforced stone which would require a lot of stone to upgrade say you make a x and upgrade to reinforced stone the cost would be similar to building a x but require additional C to destroy.,playrust,dc9ciaz,1,t5_2xks2

10367593,0,t3_5oc2qu,Running around solo on a server where everyone else is roaming in groups of  or  is obviously going to reduce the entertainment value.  I dont know how long youve played this game but if youre new then make sure you pick a server with low population.  Like  people at peak hours depending on map size. That way you have a higher chance of not being spotted and can work in peace but at the same time you know there are other people there so watch your back.  Its unlikely youll see anyone in your area that often but roam the map and youll run into people.  Go on servers with higher population once youre ready for a more challenging wipe.  Ive quite a few hours now and about half of them are solo. You should also consider playing on servers that has a maximum group size  or  is probably good.  Dont get too attached to your shit and dont expect to win v or v or even a v.  You see a group of geared people you fucking run your ass off.

If youre not rolling in gunpowder and metal youd run out of ammo pretty quickly if you used it frequently because youd need a lot more bullets to hit someone as many times as a bolt action could at long range.Also youd be mounted in place extremely vulnerable to countersniping I dont think a shield is a good idea unless it breaks quickly. Hell it wouldnt even need to be a bolt action  a stationary target is easy pickings for an AK semirifle or even a semipistol.Try offering a solution to any perceived problems with an idea instead of complaining that a nonexistent addition to the game is overpowered.,playrust,dck2hh1,3,t5_2xks2

10380056,0,t1_dckmmhd,gt  The controller moves their mouse along the Y axis Up and Down constantly to use the crank. Stopping this would stop the gun from firing.I think itd best be an automated action considering theyd be exposing themselves to gunfire thats probably enough of a drawback.gt  the gun would have to be cooled after cycles of about  rounds maximum. If not the gun would overheat and jam.I think a short magazine or ammunition belt would be the best way to give it a disadvantage as people would have to constantly be onpoint about reloading it. This could even negate the person whod be cranking and just make it so someone else has to run up and reload it so the gunner can keep shooting.gt ...the bullets have a chance of exploding and killing or wounding the userI personally enjoy these types of randomchance mechanics too but considering the backlash to it in games like Far Cry  its perhaps not the best idea. gt As a part of this same system if the Cooler accidentally douses the bullet container when cooling the barrel of the gun the bullets could become unusable until the gunpowder dries.I personally think thats a bit complicated and would make it too inefficient but maybe an alternative of this system although I think the best way of implementing a disadvantage would be my response to point  would be to have it jam when water isnt used at the correct intervals.Regardless it should require a good synergy between a gunner and external operator cooling it or loading the ammunition in a way that makes it exponentially more useful if you have skilled users of it.,playrust,dckn6dm,2,t5_2xks2

Im about to give it up because nobody plays this game the way I would prefer to play it which is with emphasis on creative building with a healthy side of pvp.  You are basically forced into playing exactly like every other person does build the same kind of bases kill everybody you see etc etc.  It just becomes stressful and if you arent a person whos only interest is killing everything you see then the games not for you.If you just want to build your only hope is going into a creative server where everyone will be off in their own bubbles building and its basically boring as shit.When I first started playing in the larger servers I was expecting to find amazing and unique things while exploring.  Towns markets trading posts great feats of engineering.. this game is really only limited by the communitys imagination.  But this community thinks having any imagination makes you a role player faggot.I knew there would be lots of fighting but I didnt know that was ALL there would be.

Surely youve seen all the random high walls placed luckily with the decay system they disappear after two days or something.

Nakeds shouldnt want to be charging at each other with rocks since the action could very much end up with both of them bleeding out.If players are doing this so much as they are right now the cost to dying isnt enough compared to the reward they get.Even if it was a  minute waiting time until they could resurrect might make people think twice before engaging in unnecessary combat.,playrust,dd29ysk,2,t5_2xks2

10564755,0,t3_5r8amo,PROBLEMCurrently the map is full with crap after a few hours. Random foundations and walls everywhere. This is ugly and impacts server performance.PROPOSED SOLUTIONAllow deconstruction for ressources when Decay hits two days? I think No one has building privilegeSo players can clean up the map and get something in return. Ressources gathered should reflect what was deconstructed. So stone walls give stone and so on. And the amount should be somewhat decent to make it desirable to actually deconstruct abbandoned buildings. Random crap can be deconstructed after two days Abbandoned bases can be partialy deconstructed when there is no tool cupboard Destroing the tool cupboard of an abandoned base will allow deconstruction.Maybe even add a visual clue if something can be deconstructed like a new ruinous texture.INTENDED RESULTFaster map cleanup. Less crap foundations and walls around the map. Players can get starter ressources a little bit faster.POSSIBLE PROBLEMS Players can get starter ressources a little bit faster.

Until our players become Lara Croft and can actually pull themselves up at least one floor by using their ... drumroll ... hands then boosting is an essential component in this game.  Its only unfair because you cant do it alone and the larger groups can boost their way all up to the top without having TC.  We need something that a single player can use to boost up one floor and it needs to be placeable in building blocked zones.  Ladders on soft sides have been suggested and theres been numerous other suggestions that I think have been even better search reddit for them.

Step . Code locks.  May switch this with step  depending on if you are more scared of losing your key or being flamethrowered.Most people or groups will skip over stone xs. Even blowing through the wall is unlikely to yield enough to be worth the explosives.

11053868,0,t3_5xtuzu,Few main issues i have for the component system.. early game has been replaced with p and semirifle  minutes into wipe Late game never happens for solos and small groups. I havnt done a rocket raid since the component system despite farming more than i ever have.  Servers dying. I feel like this has to do with getting burnt out after farming so much for so little. its rare to find anyone roaming with aks until satsun and they quit until the next wipe if they lose them.I dont really understand why components are so grindy. I have spent more time farming components than raw materials.I believe that if more components dropped per barrelcrate the component system would be fine. Currently its more grindy than xp.There is no long lasting reward to farming components unlike getting bps and xp where you had a goal to achieve.Bp system got a little stale on the week before bp reset played on weekly wipe monthly bp reset  pop server. But the weeks that bps wiped were the most fun.You had something to strive for during bp and xp system.

Now Im not sure if its even feasible but making more barriers to entry isnt going to work sorry.Ive said this before but the only incentive I can see to keep people on servers is the XP system you see on some modded servers. Chop trees gain woodcutting levels bonus wood. Mine rocks gain mining levels bonus stone sulfur and metal. Ditto collecting skinning hell even crafting.It addresses all the issues with stuff being too rare or too grindy and gives players some loyalty and reason to stay put after being raided  especially as the more time they put in the faster they can rebuild.But components themselves are fine IMHO.,playrust,del4lgc,0,t5_2xks2

My loot was spread across these  x rooms.  Later I added a second floor with the same design. One of the lower rooms had a hatch up to one of the upper roomsI would actually put this in the hallway next time.  All my loot was just one wall from outside except for the fact that you actually had to hit  separate rooms to get it all. After each hit you are met with not nearly enough loot to justify the Crockets.  I was raided twice within about  weeks. First time they got  of  rooms finished at the time.

This causes them to enter turret ranges very often wasting bullets.Bug Flame Turrets if placed behind Cells do deal damage however the fireballs are left on their side of the cell rather than towards the enemy.QoL Please allow cosmetics such as the banadana to work as modifications for items for example wearing a bandana  the wolf headdress looks very nice and it has no additional benefit but the bandana still reserves a slot for no good reason. To be honest i think making armorcloth modable like weapons would be nice.QoL It would be very helpfull if Flame Turrets had a minor target adjustment so they can attack slightly downwards as terrain goes up and down you cannot always place it at ground level. after all its range is low so why not allow it to tild a bit downwards.QoL AutoTurret when set to attack should ignore nonhostile animals and only attack wolf amp bearsQoL Bone Club should yield more resource than the Rock. it yields  while the starter rock yields  making the club rather useless. Of course axe or pickaxe should be better but i dont understand why the club is worse than the starter.QoL New UI for armor with more slots so you can wear gloves amp boots without sacrificing other equipment there are simply too few slots.QoL Adding Shields of different quality would grant melee weapons more potential at close range.,playrust,deqxgyw,5,t5_2xks2

11130527,0,t1_detlr6f,Pretty much in this day and age of gaming the only games that can keep the majority of hackers at bay are big AAA devs like Blizzard DICE EA etc.Especially with Early Access titles that go on sale for  a copy expect hackers. With low sale prices and the game still in development it becomes a breeding ground for any kid with moms credit card and a script. The devs resources are being used for the game development not combating hackers. And official servers which have no admins are the most unsafe areas to play.EAC is a joke VAC bans mean literally nothing when the game is  and your chance of being undetected are extremely high on official servers. If your blatant about hacking aimbot wallhacks flyhacks etc then itll be hoursdays before youre even banned. And once you are just log into another account go collect your shit and go right back to hacking.On community servers atleast there is an admin to overwatch potential hackers and once they do ban them they can remove all the hackers items deterring them from wanting to join again to troll.,playrust,detmvtm,3,t5_2xks2

If its just the two of you on a server then its really pointless. If you want to build there are plenty of creative servers that you can jump on to and start building. I would strongly advice watching some YouTube videos about how to build in Rust how to gather resources and understand the whole concept in general because it will help you.

I understand that the devs want the game to look good however I do think that some of the funnier more creative skins should be accepted.,playrust,dfh02c7,3,t5_2xks2

Which means the if the shooters game sees that an arrow has hit a person then the person that was hit will take damage no matter what even if they dont see the arrow hitting them visually. My evidence is a somewhat uncommon arrow cheat. A cheaters arrows will always hit their target no matter what because they have somehow forced their game to hit arrows on people even if theyre far away. For the victim of this type of hack they will take damage and have the arrow stuck on them but there will be no visual indication of where the arrow is coming from.I hope this gives you a better understanding of how arrows work,playrust,dfn1ev3,2,t5_2xks2

Say all the guns missed at a huge fight would be put randomly in these crates but maybe with less durability. Say someone despawns their loot in a raid and drops k gunpowder on the ground  gunpowder would be put in a purple crate.

11601653,0,t1_dgarou6,gt What those hosts really complain about is that they have now higher costs than estimated and that sweet business of hosting suddenly needs more money invested more servers more cpu power than calculated.You sound really salty that businesses are providing hosting for Rust which doesnt really make any sense.gt and they blame the developer for it that their contracts suddenly arent that profitable anymore.They blame the developer for releasing a poor update that completely tanks an entire server box for a very long time rendering all other processes on the box unresponsive or greatly diminishing performance. This is the fault of the developers that sort of thing just shouldnt happen.As a result gameserver providers that provide Rust are either going to be unable to continue doing so or do so with smaller margins. Really big providers might be able to eat the cost or they might pass it to the customer. Do you want to see the price of shared hosting increase significantly to accommodate this crappy solution?

11625082,0,t1_dgdmfg8,pardon me for my interest but in what language or scriptlanguage did you write the cheats? F.e. as you mentioned Counter Strike or i clicked on the the link Guild Wars . I do not intend nor do i have interest of writing cheats im very curious what the creators use as language on specific games. Or does it mostly depend on which engine the game use. F.e. CSS gt SourceEngine. And then you look for holes in the engine and gamedata itself and then you write in scriptlanguagelangauge on what the gamedata itself is based on? gt  finding them is i assume  of all these holes are just logicholes and not some which have flaws f.e. not function  as they should? gt only started selling cheats because i found myself to be in a really shitty situation in my life which required a decent amount of money to get out of.i read that cheatwriterssellers can earn a lot of money. However its not a safe job just like many shady jobs where you can a lot of money. I dont want to get too much into your privacy but do you work as coder freelance or for company? Or do you earn your income mostly due to a job outside of this jobarea idk... f.e. architectengineercookfiremanpolicemanor every other area? just an answer like no i dont work as coder for company or as freelancer would be more than enough. Thanks i appreciate your comments. Its interesting. If you ever want you could do an AMA. Im sure there would be tons of interesting questions and a lot of interesting answers from you coming  ofc. there would be also a lot of backlash which is also understandable which would mean you should use an another account for the ama. ,playrust,dgdpqsa,1,t5_2xks2

11641751,0,t1_dgfl6af,  Most stone nodes are found on mountainous areas and in caves already.  You also dont need stone for early game.  Thats what wood is for and with the changes to components and bodies being forced into certain locations there will be more centralized gunplay around those areas and more primitive play in other regions.  If you havent played a Zelda game you wouldnt understand. Itd mostly be for humors sake.  But chickens do flock.  Thats not unlike saying wolves travel and hunt in packs.Every naked spawn who hits a chicken could be this kid.   Being able to interact with vending machines through the map icons goes handinhand with locking resources to certain areas of the map and promotes diplomacy.  If everyone can obtain every resource then theres no reason to trade outside of rarer items like rifle bodies.  Vending machines dont serve a purpose as it stands now aside from looking pretty and costing a lot of HQM and gears unless they live in the immediate vicinity.,playrust,dgfltsz,1,t5_2xks2

11756197,0,t3_67oqu1,IMO The P didnt need a nerf the semi rifle just needed a buff the new gun FOV just looks ugly bleeding is a completely useless mechanic with how little it does and medding up takes so much resources now if you get shot once you have to med  times over before you get to full HP and rinse and repeat in a gunfight i think the medkit should be the main mode of healing like it was in legacy with the medium speed health regen over time. The bolt cant be used for much more than roofcamping nowadays because if you headshot someone with it. it does a lot of damage but they can just start strafing around and jumping away to safety while bleeding doesnt touch them at all. I like the components system but I think there should be certain ways or places to find certain rare components so you dont just spend hours looking for one with its current RNG system. Also the game is insanely unrewarding to newspawned players now landing a bunch of shots with arrows or lower tier weapons used to reward you with gear but now a lot of them have been nerfed to shit the pipe shotgun isnt the kill unless you basically get right up to the back of their head and the draw speed has been slowed to where using  will basically kill you Geared guys who arent good enough to kill skilled bow players can almost always med the damage of the bow out before they can get killed especially the same with the crossbow. the old shotgun which could be used to take down big clans from close range literally shoots confetti now.,playrust,dgslevf,3,t5_2xks2

11771952,0,t1_dgu278a,Helk actually addressed most of these today in a interesting response.  Im glad Helk is in the lead Gary cursing at the community and acting immature throughout the years reminds me of Dana White in the UFC that sort of thing is good for the minor leagues but after awhile it gets old. Helk sounds like a mature leader who genially cares about Rust and is working hard to make it a great game. ,playrust,dguds47,1,t5_2xks2

11779908,0,t1_dgv9f4l,Helk even wrote a response that he is going to be changing the system heavily this is exactly what OP is saying SHOULDNT happen. Why? Because they keep swinging to extremes with the changes instead of gradually normalising. Right now these changes are kneejerk responses instead of carefully considered modifications...which should take place iteratively as that is what makes the most sense and can be best analysed in terms of ROI.Doing it in this way is noit going to stretch out the development time on the contrary as any software developer knows it is a far more efficient approach to change and will actually result in the game being released sooner.,playrust,dgvagg5,3,t5_2xks2
11781082,0,t3_682t20,It depends really explosives in this game are situational.I only use c for armoured doors or high walls. And rockets for most else. With  rockets you can blow down a x area of walls which greatly helps open up chunks of the base but also it only takes  rockets  bean cans and then some explosive ammo or a survey charge to blow through a sheet metal door.So lets say a base is doubled walled and you need to get through that particular area and you can go through the walls or the doors. If you went by rockets it would be  if you use them on the  layers of walls if there sheet metal or lower or  c if its sheet metal or lower. If you go through the doors though sheet metal for the sake of this explanation it would be  c or  rockets  bean cans and  survey chargessome explosive ammo.So a mixture of c and rockets is the best way to raid but a ratio of like  rockets to c is probs want you want,playrust,dgvf968,1,t5_2xks2

Airlocks generally have a cargo dump.  When you die you can access the inner airlock door bring loot in from the dump put roaming supplies in their place and change the outer airlock key.Its the best workaround for not having a doorman when you are solo.,playrust,dgy435c,4,t5_2xks2
