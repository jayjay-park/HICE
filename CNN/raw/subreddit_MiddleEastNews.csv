11128598,0,t3_5ysjv5,As awful as civilian casualties are I think its important to note that these terrorist organizations set up shop with civilians all around them. Intentionally. So that there are these casualties. It limits the ability of people to carry out attacks like the ones described in this article and limits the ability for Drone strikes as well. This isnt Trump andor the US going into a town without a care for the civilians. This is the military attacking terrorists who chose to hide behindamongst human shields. ,MiddleEastNews,detf0rd,3,t5_2r9st
