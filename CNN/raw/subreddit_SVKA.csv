11763807,0,t3_679m1r,Hi! I was MissViola on the old site but apparently that name was already taken when I came to reddit.I saw the first episode last night and thought it was very well done. I havent read the book so I didnt know what to expect going in. I think the show did a good job of combining the dystopianfuture stuff with familiar detailstrends to create a really eerie atmosphere. My dad told me he read the book for a book club back when it was first published.  I think. He told me that back then he got into an argument with the other book club members because he couldnt see what they were so afraid of. He considered the religious right a weird fringe that would never have much political power.He told me last night I was wrong. ,SVKA,dgtggkm,1,t5_3k1h6
