The second was so overdone and fake I literally cringed watching it.

4696322,0,t1_ctm4rcb,Haha wow seriously? Thanks for writing me and I hope I can clear up a few things for you in my original postI do not dislike vegetarians. I am cool with whatever people want to do I was a vegetarian for a while but gave it up after some pretty serious anemic problems just couldnt get enough iron fainting all the time...My point was more about how annoying the editing and portrayal of these characters are in the show. Obviously they make the contestants spout off their memorable traits  they want us to feel more connected to these people. That being said not tasting your food on purpose is a selfinflicted disadvantage in a cooking competition. I feel she doesnt lean on that as bad as Bree did but does reference it frequently if shes panicked.But also to be fair and stick with my argument I really dont know how anyone can say they are vegetarian and then cook animals so freely. Did that bother her? I mean of course shes not eating it but surely preparing the meat and being involved in its consumption for others does have more impact than avoiding it altogether. I would love to hear her thoughts on it I am just going by how I would feel in the situation. Shes obviously a brilliant cook and her meat dishes always somehow turn out amazing lol better than people who brag about cooking meat. If anything I would like to see her brag about that! Way to stick up for your wife hope you dont feel like were crapping all over her really its just the terrible editing of the show and overkill with the character traits.

8555934,0,t3_4wxpc3,Until last week I was rooting for Terry and Andrea as my main faves of the season. Hoping for a redemption round one of the highlights of season  and seeing as they didnt do a second chance with the first few contestants it still seems possible because I thought her elimination was really brutal and with the whole its so moist! youre the best! it also seemed a bit too much of a storyDans great entertainment and with each episode hes turning into a better chef. I think itd be hilarious if he ended up in the top . Nathan is probably not as bad as the show makes him out to be but I dont enjoy his character on the show. I dont like how everyones treating him poorly but then each episode he does actually fail at something that a contestant on masterchef shouldnt struggle with. I started out liking Katie but now I couldnt care less about where she ends. Since last episode Ive really started to like Tanorria though and I wouldnt mind to keep her for another few weeks. Eric is honestly such a piece of toast that I wasnt even sure he was in last episode. That could be good though because somehow in each season theres always cooks that seemingly start to shine all of a sudden usually around this point. David is probably great but they havent really tried to edit in some personality for him so I cant imagine him actually making it to the end.Brandis character however has been pushed from the very beginning in fact she was the first person to go into a duel in episode  just like Claudia last year. Shes a mom and shes all about cooking her children diverse food. Sure last years winner was a mom but Brandi has specifically excelled at food for the family and cooking on a budget subjects which could go directly into a cookbook. Although last season they were pushing each of Hetals dishes so much that I thought she was a real contender and they were trying to get people ready for her cookbookI almost completely forgot about Shaun again even though in each team challenge he is consistently chosen as the first person. Those kind of people in previous seasons generally have never been the winners though. I dont care much for Shaun.As far as characters go I think Im most attached to Terry Tanorria and Dan but I think Brandi is going to be close.,Masterchef,d6b2f0f,1,t5_2smz3

Its not offensive to eat caterpillars and isnt meant as an attack on Africans. In fact the first Google image for Zambian Cuisine is caterpillars.Caterpillars are a delicacy in Zambia. It is sold in some markets and even served as a snack in some restaurants.Caterpillars can be prepared either boiled or cooked. Boiled caterpillars are similar to eating steamed meat while fried caterpillars are crunchy on the outside but soft on the inside.Caterpillars have a meaty taste to them which makes you forget all your preconceptions about eating insects. Caterpillars are also a good source of protein as well as being rich in other minerals such as calcium zinc magnesium potassium iron and phosphorus as well as various vitamins.And Nathan did use squash in the bibimbap challenge which is also commonly used in Zambian cuisine. ,Masterchef,d74yehm,3,t5_2smz3

This is why we hear about frat houses and Kentucky  times an episode.   This is one of the few times on the show David had even mentioned poker if I recall correctly.   Usually its been one of the judges trying to goad him into saying something about gambling or poker.,Masterchef,d7ekf56,1,t5_2smz3
8875621,0,t3_51rvu3,Agreed. They really seem to be pushing Vegas vs Vegas. Shaun and David arent all that likeable so Brandi is going to be the more marketable one. My guess anyway,Masterchef,d7eq3e8,7,t5_2smz3

8913166,0,t1_d7ett9l,Its conceivable that he thinks Dan had advance knowledge of the split and was told to pick a horrible basket by the producers to create drama. I doubt hed be contractually permitted to say something like that outright at least while the show is still airing. But maybe he was hoping thats the conclusion wed all reach. It was a pretty weird move on Dans part to be fair. Either way his thinking would make his level of anger more understandable. ,Masterchef,d7j8d75,2,t5_2smz3
8923802,0,t1_d7f08q7,He thought he was gone too he muttered its too late or something like that. The producers really wanted him to stay for some reason so they sent Gordon in to get his Oscar nomination...,Masterchef,d7kidcv,1,t5_2smz3

8961582,0,t1_d7p0pdv,Incentive is one thing but what about capability? Everything we see is vetted through the narrative decided by the editorswriters of the show. Our perspective is warped from that alone and if David wanted to manipulate the audience he would have to work off a narrative he has no power over.,Masterchef,d7p1psj,1,t5_2smz3
