1031158,0,t3_25ukq3,It depends on the passport you have for how long you can stay in China. If you have a US passport you can stay in HK for  daysAs for the return date it doesnt matter. All that matters is that each stay in China is less than  days or whatever you got for your visa. Each time you reenter that count resets. So you could stay  days leave for a day come back on day  and then stay for another .,Chinavisa,chlhxoj,2,t5_2vwx8

1786112,0,t1_ck3n3v9,Did they make you do it when you got the new Z last year? They may have just decided they need one on file connected to this current residence permit.You shouldnt need one with every renewal. Im on a Yunnanissued Z that Ive renewed for at least five years now and they never required a medical exam after the first one. Then again sometimes they come up with some weird shit and you can never figure out why. Maybe they pulled some hep positive foreign tourist out of a whore house in your town or something.,Chinavisa,ck4aj9z,1,t5_2vwx8
2734894,0,t3_2ps861,I have heard of people paying agents k RMB for new  year visas. This would mean that you would be granted the visa in situations that you would not otherwise be granted the visa. ,Chinavisa,cney1rq,1,t5_2vwx8
2794365,0,t1_cnlp15z,Are you sure? Do you have any reference for this? I have seen in a couple different places where it specifically says that if you are working for a foreign company located outside of China and you are getting paid with money coming from outside of China then you need to apply for a Z Visa if you plan to be in China for more than  months and an M Visa if you plan to be in China for less than  months. It seems like if it was impossible to get a Z Visa while working for a foreign company the visa resources would just say that. ,Chinavisa,cnlpiyy,0,t5_2vwx8

4234309,0,t1_cs2ajsb,Thanks! I read a little about using visa agencies but heard a couple of horror stories about people silently getting lifetime blacklists afterward.The learning Chinese route is definitely interesting  Im not fluent in Mandarin yet and my GF is involved in languages.

4536672,0,t3_3cmpyk,From a Shenzhen perspective it can literally be turn up to the HK border crossing and minutes later back in the mainland with another  days.For Shanghai obviously with flight delays and so on youre not going to be able to do the same kind of speed run but definitely a few hours would be sufficient. ,Chinavisa,ct2h96v,1,t5_2vwx8
6141509,0,t3_3xxtqq,If you need to get a new work visawork permit they will require a criminal record check from your home country.  For the USA you can give someone back home power of attorney from the US embassy get your fingerprints taken at a local place listed on the embassy website then have the feds or your local police send the results to your power of attorney recipient.  The best thing to do would be to check with your embassy.,Chinavisa,cynq4iu,1,t5_2vwx8

6240833,0,t1_cyz07vk,Shouldnt really be an issue as long as they use a competent agency. Keep in mind youll almost definitely have to go back to your home country to get a new visa. Your new company should pay for that trip.,Chinavisa,cyz0k4g,1,t5_2vwx8
7298194,0,t1_d25uz18,Thanks for the detailed answer!Im still in the process of finding out which option would be best to get a visa and getting a d single entry in the Netherlands seems to be a good option. However it looks like I need to hand in more documents over here but on the other hand I can travel directly into China How does getting a multiple entry visa in HK work though? You cant get a multiple entry initially in Hong Kong but it is possible after you return over there?Furthermore my current passport is only  months valid from now. When I get a new one I also have a different document number thus a new identity in China. Do you think I should use this in my advantage by filling it with tourist visa right now so I can easier get future visa in the new passport? Or am I overthinking this aspect...About the work stuff I just think I need to go there first. Meeting people and being able to show my face after an application makes the most difference I guess. Your information helps to get a better focus on which companies to focus!,Chinavisa,d27r6wr,1,t5_2vwx8

8214547,0,t3_4rulh2,If you are serious you need to get the job and work visa settled before you move. That then becomes a year residency permit. You will need to renew every year perhaps every  if your company can swing it. However you cant simply work online and live in China you have to be employed with a Chinese company.People with permanent residency are usually people who have invested millions USD or done other things to catch the eye of the government. They are incredibly rare.,Chinavisa,d54dfv0,1,t5_2vwx8

8409970,0,t3_4utsc9,Ok you have a two entry tourist visa. You dont confirm the length of each visit though you do refer to  days.  Answer is yes. As soon as you go through immigration into Hong Kong then youve finished your first visit. Once you reenter mainland China you nd visit starts for the length of stay allowed.,Chinavisa,d5sshdv,1,t5_2vwx8

9185473,0,t1_d8frsvi,So you came in on a business visa applied for a z visa while in China worked finished your contract went back to the UK and applied again?What about for your very first visa  the business one? You didnt need to hand in a medical that time either?Im thinking if you did then maybe youre already registered in their health system or something so your employer didnt need to ask for it maybe...?I heard it was difficult or frowned upon to switch over to a different visa if youre already in China... Were your employers both schools for the z visas? Were they big chain schools?The guide my school gave me said they needed the medical report for SAFEA State Administration of Foreign Experts Affairs so they can make my work permit they referred to it as Permit for Foreign Experts Working in China . Then when the school gets the permit they write up the invitation letter and send it to me by post.gt Unique circumstances? You mean your systems full of pot and a medical in your home country would show this?Haha no I really meant it when I said I was clean. No the issue is more moneyrelated.,Chinavisa,d8gbqmq,1,t5_2vwx8
9624682,0,t3_5ctg5j,Yeh it does sound proper strange.I have strong doubts this a visa regulation of any kind.It could very well be as is always the case in such demands that your employer has been stung by a dodgy foreigner in the past or has dodgy hiringpractices himself and this is a requirement from the local PSB immigration office.Be firm but understanding in refusing this and see how far you can get. Doubt they will drop you after going this far.,Chinavisa,d9zfvbx,1,t5_2vwx8

Saying that Ive also got  years of work experience. With the new system youll be calculated. If you can hit  points B minimum then you should be okay. Not sure what will happen is youre a C grade.
