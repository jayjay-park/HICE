3238111,0,t3_2x5503,I got a little bit excited when I saw this and a  off atat in stock at my closest Walmart. Purchased both and waited for the pick up or cancellation emails. Two hours later I got pick up emails for both. Whee!!! I showed up and the guy brings out two totally different items with these orange slips that state Please ask customer if they accept item. Apparently this particular store isnt allowed to cancel orders that arent in stock it makes them look bad to corporate he said and makes associates offer somewhat similar substitutes at full price of course. Sigh. Thirty minutes later I received refund emails stating I had returned the items...Fwiw I dont think this is too common. Ive had like a dozen orders cancelled at other local walmarts  one as recent as Sunday. ,legodeal,coxmy2k,2,t5_2ya9f

4528209,0,t3_3d0dqc,Walmarts apparently all over the US are for some reason discounting almost half of their LEGO stuff. Ive read about it all over rlego. My two local Walmart had almost all their Star Wars on clearance most of the Super Hero stuff BIONICLEs City etc. ,legodeal,ct1f1gp,2,t5_2ya9f
