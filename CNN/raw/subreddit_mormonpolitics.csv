1219336,0,t1_ci6rer5,Okay let me clarify all of those things you listed would essentially belong to Joe Millionaire if he acquired them through hard and smart work. If Joe was immortal they would only belong to him for as long sa he kept them. As we are not immortals Joe can acquire a surplus of all of those things you listed and not having enough of his own lifetime left to enjoy them for as long as theyll be around he can pass those onto his son Johnny. Put it on a smaller scale you and your neighbor both have babies born on the same day. You go to work as a cop and your neighbor is a cashier at Taco Bell. In a freak coincidence youre both killed when you respond to an armed robbery where he works. Now as for your final paycheck if were following your logic its unfair for the neighbor kid to get less than your kid because neither should be born with more than the other. Never mind the fact that you did harder work that was more valuable to society amirite?Opportunity is more abstract than youd like it to be. Its like this I have as much of an opportunity to be an actor as any of these people who were born in the same year as me. They had more talent went to acting schools and genuinely pursued their careers. I did not. Is it their fault that I didnt? No. That was my personal responsibility. I also could have been a restaurant manager a cop a singermusician or a writer. It takes effort persistence practice skill and time. Money can get you so far but theres a reason Jack and Kelly Osbourne arent making as much money as Ozzy Because being born into wealth and status doesnt mean you can remain in wealth and status.As for the rest... well Id have to go back and look at what I wrote again but its clear to me now that you think Im a fool and are signing off in passiveaggressive style typical of a progressive liberal when backed into a corner of logic lash out call names but subtly so you can act surprised and hurt when your opponent calls you out on it and bat your eyelashes as you bid a very insincere good day through a fake smile. Good day to you then jerk.,mormonpolitics,ci6skxd,1,t5_2uubs
1498539,0,t3_2a7k3j,I came here to complain about Rick Perry. I dont understand how Perry could claim to be Christian and want to send National Guard troops to the border to scare children.

6278863,0,t3_41474r,Potentially relevant a national survey of attitudes and political preferences shows a clear and statistically significant trait that predicts whether someone favors Trump authoritarianism.gt Authoritarianism is not a new untested concept in the American electorate. Since the rise of Nazi Germany it has been one of the most widely studied ideas in social science. While its causes are still debated the political behavior of authoritarians is not. Authoritarians obey. They rally to and follow strong leaders. And they respond aggressively to outsiders especially when they feel threatened. From pledging to make America great again by building a wall on the border to promising to close mosques and ban Muslims from visiting the United States Trump is playing directly to authoritarian inclinations.gt Not all authoritarians are Republicans by any means... in the  Democratic primary the political scientist Marc Hetherington found that authoritarianism mattered more than income ideology gender age and education in predicting whether voters preferred Hillary Clinton over Barack Obama.gt OTOH there appears to have been a shift in this.  percent of likely Republican primary voters I surveyed score in the top quarter of the authoritarian scalemore than twice as many as Democratic voters.Whats interesting to me is that while typically conservative the average LDS voter may not score as highly on authoritarianism scales as many others on the conservative side.,mormonpolitics,cz3c44g,2,t5_2uubs
6881799,0,t1_d0wavlx,gt In other words between wise good and honest I could reasonably see prioritizing wise e.g. agreeing with my ideological position over good and honestespecially if you perceive the other side to be none of the above.gt Wow I really disagree. How wise can someone be if theyre not good or honest? I think these three all go together without one the others are shams.Wisdom can come in all shapes and sizes Its simply useful knowledge gained from experience. I think its commonly agreed that even lying can sometimes be a wise choice if its to everyones benefit.As an example as president there are certainly times when you avoid sharing specific things with the public avoid panicetc. That same president could be seen as dishonest but could still be voted for because people prioritize that wisdom over being perfectly honest all the time thus blabbing harmful statemilitary secrets.tldr Good or bad wisdomadvice is a matter of individual perspective to us nontimetraveling mortals at least.,mormonpolitics,d0wd8m3,3,t5_2uubs

10846041,0,t3_5qqa8x, I voted for Evan IE against Trump because I believed the prognosticators pointing out his fascist tendencies. Since the election I have lost my faith...... in prognosticators. Most of the reports that I have have been the panic stricken extrapolations of the implications of his words. And I remembered my lifelong aversion to catastrophist Chicken Littles. Not to start an off thread fight but as an example Climate Chicken Littles have been telling us that we have a maximum of ten years to address THE PROBLEM at five year intervals for at least fifty of my sixty years. People running in circles screaming in panic no longer impress me much. Having said that by ignoring both the Chicken Littles and the blather coming out of his own mouth most of the very few thing that he has actually done in three weeks again way too early to panic have been pleasant surprises. It seems possible that he might actually close an agency or two something Reagan aspired to but never accomplished.      ,mormonpolitics,ddyoyf9,1,t5_2uubs
