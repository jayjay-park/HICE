11780950,0,t3_64m5fz, Unanswered calls have not costed me any silver. Calls are almost always rounded by the minute for all providers. Most MVNOs do count calls to voicemail as talk minutes because you are still using cell service. This happens to most cell phones. This is not a CellNuvo issue it is just how phones are. Blocking a number will not stop cell services from being used in the first place. Not much you can do about that.Overall these are not to be blamed directly at CellNuvo but more as how cellular services currently work today. As CellNuvo is a MVNO they really are charging what they are being charged from phone usage. Sprint is the one that measures your usage so it really fall on them on how they charge not CellNuvo.I have used this service for quite awhile now and I think it is fair on how they charge because as a former mobile sales associate I know that most cell services charge this way. As for the credits charged for not answering a call I dont know what to tell you because I have not had that problem before.Bogus Accounting probably not.Hopefully You Can Sort Out The Issues You Having Because CellNuvo Is A Very Nice Service And I Wish It To Prosper Unlike Ringplus...,CellNuvo,dgvepsd,1,t5_3j27n
