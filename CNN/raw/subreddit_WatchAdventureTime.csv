10484835,0,t3_5q1s9n,I dont understand why people do not consider this common practice with all TV shows. The subreddits are almost always for official release discussions. I am annoyed with the stevenuniverse subreddit because the leaks ended up being allowed posted after ish days of the leaks being out. I didnt get spoiled but many people are force or prefer to wait for the official release as leaks do not support the show. Im not saying I am one of those people and I definitely am guilty of watching shows online where it doesnt support the show dont screw over the good mostly for lack of a good word fans who watch the show where is supports the creators.,WatchAdventureTime,dcwkcms,3,t5_37iyw
