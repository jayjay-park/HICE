3750992,0,t3_33dd4o,gtStart running IWW like an Anarchist organization.I think this is a really good point. Specifically since reading it a thought which has been on my mind has been that the Platformist Anarchism espoused in Black Flame is a virtually perfect organisational model for the modern IWW who bysize finds itself in the position of a militant minority. Whatever action we take we need to be able to exert the full weight of our engaged membership so as to have effect through considerable collective actionThat being said I think we should remember that the IWW has not always been solely focused on dual unionism and that it has at times focused on boring from within the business unions. On this note Prairie Struggle has already fairly thoroughly expounded upon what needs to be done to do this. If we as an organisation are able to exert our collective action so as to have a coordinated effort at boring from within to create and seize control of combative unions I believe this would be truly revolutionary.,IWW,cqju7qx,1,t5_2rno8

9134796,0,t1_d88y4w9,Neglect and other issues happen just as often in branches as it does with online contacts sadly. It often takes a lot of initiative to manage to get and stay connected with the union because the people who run the branches usually are quite busy with jobs and the troubles this causes their lives. I dont see this need for initiative ever changing and Im not entirely sure it ever should. The problem isnt the effort IMO its the difficulty in building and maintaining confidence both for new members and old.,IWW,d89wgxf,2,t5_2rno8
