1289615,0,t1_cieina5,Thanks for the reply. I think I mabey confused people. I ment u can get diamonds for patatoes using the witchery charm.it only works with a random pig the others have different trades but i can dupe the pig with a mob spawned. Im trying to figure out a way to automate the trade with the pig. My idea was giving a turtle the charm setting up a if pig has trade than trade x. If pig does not have trade move x blocks along an axis to trade with next spawned pig. Im trying to figure out if a turtle can do trades and use the charm or mabey the Thaum auto activator. Right now I can manually trade  potatoes with a copied pig but want it to run chunkloaded by itself trying to figure out a way to trade without me thier doing the trade.

Id rather stick with the sure fire  per.Minechem also as OP as fuck enchants. Im on multiplayer and I have a  normal apples that give me  minute regeneration. I also have a butter sword gold sword that applies wither poision fire hunger.

2677553,0,t1_cn7dpz3,The Factorization pulverizer gets . emeraldsdiamonds per ore.  Combine that with trading autofarmed siliconwheatwool for emeralds and diamond gear that can be disassembled into diamonds from villagers and you are pretty well set on those two.However using Minechem to turn logs into diamonds could be useful.  I can gather  stacks of logs in about  seconds.  If that results in even  diamonds that might be faster than using villagers.I use regeneration spell from Ars Magica .  That should be plenty.  Your butter sword sounds nifty but I like my obscenely buffed tartarite rapier.  It also ignores armor.  And yeah perhaps I will just podunk around with mods that are selfencapsulating when Im done with Blood Magic Hardcore Ender Expansion and Galacticraft.  Im still working towards getting a tier  blood altar.  Everything good requires nether stars and theres no easy way to farm wither skeleton skulls except for manually killing them with a  beheading tartarite cleaver in a netherlocated skeleton spawner.Thanks for your input.  ,crackpack,cn82sfx,1,t5_31ac1

3264279,0,t3_2xiahm,No one said the pack was meant to be easy. That being said theres a reason I typically only play singleplayer worlds on Peaceful.Regarding Morph the blockstallbat problem is actually a problem with Ars Magica which has been fixed as of ... but that version was not available yet when version ... of the pack came out. Im sure theyre planning on including that and several other fixed versions of the various mods as soon as a few key mods are updated as well.There are also other ways to fly which dont have the risk of suffocating in the ceiling they just take more work to get than Morph does. Also if there were a ton of mobs waiting for you at spawn then the other players havent done a good enough job at lighting the area so that doesnt happen. There are certainly plenty of light sources available to do just that some of which have more than the standard light range and some very expensive to make will actually prevent most mobs from spawning within a several block radius beyond the range of the light.In order to transfer RF from the generator to the machines you need either an EnderIO Energy Conduit comes in  types depending on how much you want to move at a time or a Rednet Energy Cable not as effective as the highertier EnderIO conduits but sufficient for the lava generator. The Rednet cable is easier to make but the basic EnderIO conduits are cheaper in the longrun.The lack of the Thermal Expansion energy conduits and Item and Fluiducts is due to the TE team splitting them off into a separate mod because of some major rewrites needed to get them working in ... If they had waited to include them in the main mod we probably wouldnt have a .. version of TE yet. ,crackpack,cp0crro,1,t5_31ac1

Id try to adjust your memory allocation flags as those are far from optimal for using the pack.For one thing the PermGen flags are a little weird try setting both of them to . Next your Maximum memory flag Xmx is too low for the pack and the Minimum Xms while not as critical should probably go down to M. In general a lot of these large Minecraft host services are geared more for Vanilla Minecraft which may be fine for some mod packs but the CrackPack is far more demanding. ,crackpack,cukxrql,1,t5_31ac1
