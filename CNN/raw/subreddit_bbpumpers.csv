6272847,0,t3_41ebzv,Maybe try to extend the letdown suction time? My pump and most pumps I think start with short bursts of suction to mimic a baby nursing. Theres a button to switch between this and the regular pump pattern. Sorry if this is super obvious and you know thus erring on the side of too much info. If it normally goes two minutes maybe try going back to that part of the cycle longer?,bbpumpers,cz2nha1,1,t5_3br12
6296056,0,t3_41ebzv,I start pretty soon about  secs in..... but it takes forever to get empty.  Usually  minutes. Sometimes I can get done in  but not if it has been  hours.  I just figure Im slow   Looking at photos of your baby or videos can help with letdown.  Breast massage helps me a ton  wo massage I would never get empty!  Taking a shower before can help with letdown as well.,bbpumpers,cz5agia,1,t5_3br12

6547333,0,t1_czwi6u7,Dont feel guilty.  Your milk supply isnt going to plummet  youll still be pumping just as much!  You arent doing anything wrong no matter how you feed him as long as hes being fed!  ,bbpumpers,czwjq6m,3,t5_3br12
6686634,0,t3_44t0il,Keep trying! My kiddo has always hated the bottles and preferred the breast except during nursing strikes when hes in pain teething and has a coldthen he hates all forms of nourishment and demands that I feel like a terrible mommy. So I dont have the same experience of exclusively pumping and bottle feeding but if you keep offering both each day your LO may decide to like breastfeeding again ,bbpumpers,d0ayfsv,1,t5_3br12
6844208,0,t3_49imu1,I mix my milk. I do notice sometimes that the milk from the morning pump at work seems to have more fat collecting at the top than the afternoon pumps. FWIW I do keep track of the times that I pump. I am donating my extra milk to a milk bank and they like to have time time of collection on the bags. So maybe it matters in babies that have health issues this milk bank provides milk exclusively to preemies and NICU babies but I dont think it matters for a healthy baby. ,bbpumpers,d0s3hzp,2,t5_3br12
6847979,0,t1_d0sisbv,Ugh. This just sucks cuz I hate my job and now not only do I have to be away from my daughter but I also am going to have to quit giving her breast milk way earlier than I had hoped.,bbpumpers,d0six9y,1,t5_3br12
7493153,0,t1_d2txanf,Definitely will try lanolin first before I get resized!  ,bbpumpers,d2txixc,1,t5_3br12
8856049,0,t3_51eulz,Hot compress and then right after pump and turn that sucker on HIGH and massage at the same time. A NICU nurse gave me that tip once and totally worked. Hurt like hell but oh my god the sweet relief. Turning the pump up super high almost felt good after that pain. ,bbpumpers,d7cdebm,1,t5_3br12
