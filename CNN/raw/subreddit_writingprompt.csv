1215690,0,t3_280pn0,Okay... So its  I was watching TV in one of those cabinet tvs  it was late at night  but the Ateam which just came out at the beginning of the year was playing  it was getting late and I was getting tired.   I kept dosing on and off and I came to.  There was static on the TV and I heard a voice.   The voice spoke of the future and had said this ignorant fuck was going to urge me to write a story against him on some open speech forum  the voice said it must be stopped and I wrote down what the voice had told me to do.   When I woke up the next morning I read the paper it had giraffenipples moms address and phone number on it  and said to sleep with her on the day that giraffenipples dad was to get with her.   I waited and waited and when that month arrived I swooned on his mom.   And when that day came we made sweet passionate love.   Problem solved right? Nope not that easy  you see giraffenipples mom got pregnant  which I though would have solved it.   I looked at the paper again because I had my worries  I had realized that it said dont sleep with giraffenipples mom.  I broke it off and she keep seeing giraffenipples dad  I believe they got married  she had the baby and said it was his  turned out giraffenipples looked more like his mother. So anyway we fast forward to today and it turns out that my son is acting ignorant again ,writingprompt,ci6dtjz,3,t5_2rwoa
4026066,0,t3_35nft5,I wake up as I always do.  No sense of time.  The same four walls.  No door.  No windows.  The only light from the small strip around the ceiling.The food slot is open again.  Hardtack and water and cold beans.  I collect the hardtack and put the water cup on the floor eat the beans.  The food slot closes after about  minutes.  Same as every day.Pushups  Im up to .  Situps .  I spend a little time in meditation.  Time is fluid here though.  I dont know how long I spend meditating.  I count to .Ive been using the hardtack to etch the walls.  Art is my only release  my only form of expression.  I talk to myself just to make sure I still remember how but Im so scared someone will answer me one day.I call it art.  Im not really an artist though.  I draw the mice the animals.  Its mostly just lines and patterns.  I started after  I dont know  a month or so?  Ive been here long enough to cover two walls and Im halfway through the third.The edges of the hardtack go quickly.  Theres eight of them and I get an inch or two out of each one before they dull too much and I cant really get the line I want.  Drop the hardtack into my water.While it soaks I sit on the floor with my back against the wall.  I tell myself a story.  Tonight I tell myself the story of... hmm...Alias Jesse James.  Thats one I havent done.  And theres lots of different voices I can pretend to imitate.  I think Im getting pretty good at the girl ones.  Well I was hoping to become your assistant.  Hah.  Why is that so fucking funny all of the sudden?I eat the hardtack while I act out the film for myself  scraping it with my teeth you cant really bite it  trying to remember all the lines from the movie.  I wish I could do the girl voices better.I leave the cup on the floor.  Its always gone in the morning no matter where I hide it.  I even tried to stay up and catch them at it but theyre watching me.  Theyve got to be.  When I stay up theres no food slot.  I even tried faking it once but no dice.This is just how it is.  I go to sleep thinking about the cute Rhonda Fleming.  I wonder if she was really that cute or if I just remember her that way because she looked like someone else?  Sleep comes again.I wake up as I always do.  No sense of time.  The same four walls.  No.  Three walls and a door.  The food slot isnt open but theres a hallway now.  About ten feet down.  I feel naked.  Im not but I dont have a weapon.  I dont have...My eyes are wet.  Son of a bitch.  Blink em back.  Cant let em see me crying.  I walk toward the other end of the hall.  The door slides open on its own.  Outside four giant heads are staring at me.  What?  Why are they..?  Where am I?  I try to turn around and look back at my room but Im lying down.  Why cant I see my room?  Where am I?I try to talk but nothing comes out.  Why am I so cold?  Where is my voice?  Who are you people?  A barely audible croak escapes my throat.  It sounds ghastly.Welcome back to the world of the living Mr. Disney.,writingprompt,crf795j,2,t5_2rwoa
