Problem is without a discount all that would cost rubies total which feels insane. Should I wait for the next  discount or just evolve zebram now? How do I find out when theres a discount event going on without going into the evolve screen to check?

I have Jacky at  and cat girl at  and  s I can evo at the moment.By the way is Sion still worth awakening? I have him at  for a while now but I dont really use him in anything. Im thinking that maybe I could awaken him when theres a discount up and then boot Ciel from my arena lineup for him? I currently have Lana Liana Zebram Ciel and Jacky.,soulseeker,d753un7,1,t5_36333

8803405,0,t1_d75rer4,Liana Tami and Liz are the top  ranges.  Jacard is very good but definitely at . Siara is a really good hero both in arena and as a support in scenario.Melee is a big log jam basically at awaken you need your melee to have oath or OD at awaken and theyll be pretty good.  Top tier are Lana Zeb Yuria Warren Orga Pan Ramia Bunz and Voros.  At least those are some of the more sought out ones.  WarrenBunzVoros are much more situational than the others but still seen as very good and are quite strong.Hope that helps!,soulseeker,d761sxv,1,t5_36333

9837561,0,t1_dapsdt3, choices are less crucial than . Youll get more  heroes pretty soon. rd day gives another selective   full complete of Hard mode gives a random   complete guide quest also gives a random  . That can all happen in a week.In PvE having good heroes is more important than meleeranged except for your Lead hero  that one should be melee. Having one melee and rest ranged is OK.In PvP the advance is very slow youll get many choices by that time. Youll be staying around  rating for a few weeks and then around  for a long time most likely months  you need more awakened  heroes to progress further and that takes about a month each.So what you get is great and wont set you back.Rather than hero choice what can go disappointing for you is awakened skill on your  hero. If you want a superperfect start you also want a good skill  but that might take  or  or even more restarts to get both great heroes and great awaken skill so probably best to ignore that.,soulseeker,dapuuxj,2,t5_36333

11333465,0,t3_61r1zy,Some honourable mentionsYuria Lana Minnet gt Ramia Vicky Bunz Patima  gt Irene Sion Voros sylvia gt Melee Healers and so on...Note thats just a rough guideline. Dont take it as law D The current meta for a long time has put strong melee fears at the top. Then you have strong melee flinchers stunners then the squishy melee damage dealers and then healers IMO.Healer leads are for safety but not neccessarily the Best in PVE. If you want speed and efficiency you are better off with a damage dealer lead.,soulseeker,dfgmn4e,2,t5_36333
