319032,0,t3_1xq37f,The update before this which added color coded comments was fine but when I updated today to .. I noticed this same issue with the night theme,reddit_news,cfdu4zf,1,t5_2tc31
426035,0,t3_1yvjcd,Im able to make the gif work in hangouts I download the gif in Reddit News with the down arrow button you see when you open the preview and then go into hangouts and attach it like any other image Id send with hangouts. ,reddit_news,cfox9j3,1,t5_2tc31
576254,0,t1_cg5rscm,gt And of course it would be optional.But then the dev has to support two separate UIs. Each time someone has an issue and they give little to no info on the problem which happens  of the time he has to respond with Is this the Cards UI or standard UI? etc. Its a lot of work for sure. ,reddit_news,cg5rw78,4,t5_2tc31

2136804,0,t3_2jfhe3,For the love of God uDBrady you have outdone yourself this time! Excuse my language but fuck sake this app was amazing before this update but now geeze. Even if Reddit comes out with an official app if it isnt Reddit news there isnt a chance Im going to use it.I paid for the pro version  weeks ago is there any other way to donate?,reddit_news,clbfnrw,20,t5_2tc31

2255646,0,t3_2l153c,Just add rrandnsfw to your subreddits. Dont subscribe to it though,reddit_news,clqipt0,4,t5_2tc31
2266664,0,t3_2l64yz,Its done this for me many times. A refresh usually fixes it until I get to the next page of content and it needs to refetch the new posts. Im running a rooted Nexus  on . with xposed,reddit_news,clrvo63,3,t5_2tc31

2336016,0,t1_clzwwt0,Ah ok that makes sense as it seemed kind of obvious. Whenever I have to resetup RN it automatically syncs when I login the first time. I see you got it sorted.,reddit_news,cm0g08s,2,t5_2tc31
2388573,0,t3_2mrm16,Agree. ,reddit_news,cm6xo3e,2,t5_2tc31
2418692,0,t3_2n5z93,I am seeing something similar on my GS with GPE ROM. I can only view one or two posts before OP disappears which is annoying as hell having to restart the app every time. Here is what it looks like on my end   The first image is where the comments begin and the second is where OP should be. Note OP does show up for links seems to be self posts that never show up.,reddit_news,cmanqp5,1,t5_2tc31
2451451,0,t1_cmeouyy,Ah good point. I didnt think of that. It was directly over the main app but ill keep an eye out!,reddit_news,cmepb08,1,t5_2tc31

3028951,0,t1_cobwx33,Agreed. Coloured nav bar looks terrible in all the apps Ive seen so far that have implemented it. ,reddit_news,coby5ih,6,t5_2tc31
3035981,0,t1_coco3uc,If its force quitting Android should give you an option to send reports in. Are you getting an error on the crashes? That would be where you can do it. If not you can message uDbrady here on reddit. Hes the lone developer. ,reddit_news,cocog37,1,t5_2tc31
