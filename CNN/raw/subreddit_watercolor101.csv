4012099,0,t3_36czxe,Im trying it out.I have a tendency to finish one part of the painting before moving onto the next. I didnt realize I didnt even follow the instructions until after I went back through the progress pics. I really need to change my habits. Im not entirely sure which pigment I used but I think its burnt sienna from Windsor Newton. I need to work on sketching lightly. Also  its kinda scary to do the background when everything is one color. Im kind of hesitant to go for it because I keep thinking Ill accidentally make some of the objects disappear. ,watercolor101,crdlz9x,5,t5_386h6
4242652,0,t1_cs3tru9,Good work  you got some very distinct secondary colors.  When you are ready for Exercise  come back and check this reference.  Id be interested in knowing which  colors you decide to go with.,watercolor101,cs3uqpr,1,t5_386h6
4404181,0,t3_3atvjg,I think I should retry this exercise as well. my submissionI didnt realize until it was too late that I did my undersketch with a colored pencil and not a watercolor pencil. You can see the lines like wax resist. I also am not happy with how I handled the bottle the crop and the rendering. ,watercolor101,csm33yv,1,t5_386h6
4493568,0,t3_3cljw1,Exercise.  I plan on doing a couple of these.,watercolor101,csx2nlf,3,t5_386h6
4653562,0,t1_cth09wc,Thanks! Yeah I feel like the metal might just take practice? Like there are tiny sharp reflections in there but I have no idea where Id start trying to capture them.,watercolor101,cth53ks,2,t5_386h6
8185603,0,t1_d50iv3c,I think galia is on the money. The creatures are mostly mid tones. They need more extreme lightdark mostly light. Most good water color painters leave white areas. Additionally the silhouette of the tortoise is unavoidably boring which doesnt help. The bird is mostly mid tones and youve added a only slightly lighter mid tone behind it as a background which makes things worse. It needs To stand out more. Light against dark dark against light is a good rule.You could also try scrubbing out some color to make areas brighter. ,watercolor101,d50r1ru,1,t5_386h6
8418171,0,t1_d5ohhnn,This is so great..  this feels like a stolen edge or a tangent. It might be nicer if they didnt meet like that.. this cap  and  this cap have a nice form whereas this  feels a bit shapeless. Possibly because the top plane isnt quite in perspective or doesnt have a clean edge between it and the sides. . I was first struck by the beautiful wash for the purple background and the black table really well done!. This is my favorite part of the painting  I like the way the bottle is represented I like the edges and overlap between the bottle the surface and the background. ,watercolor101,d5ttc1w,3,t5_386h6
8606219,0,t1_d6gpcro,Thanks for the critique! I was afraid the lemons would get lost with all the yellow in the background but threw caution to the wind and gave it a shot. The whites of the highlights were all saved using a masquepen. When it came to the lemons I went back and lifted and scrubbed a bit to get the soft edges.  The speckles you mention for D actually came from the paint I used for the last layer in that area. It is Sicklerite Genuine from Daniel Smith and has this granulation effect. It turns out lovely. ,watercolor101,d6hdesp,1,t5_386h6
8782007,0,t1_d7352cs,Never too late!  Glad you joined in.  Man thats a fantastic painting  very well done.  Very loose.  It seems pretty obvious to me that youre a fairly advanced watercolorist.  A couple of quick observations  it looks like you came back and added some highlights with a white gel pen.  Nothing wrong with that  I do it sometimes too.  Im not sure it served you particularly well with the item in the foreground candle right?.  Flames are notoriously difficult to paint.. you were going to have to make up some kind of abstraction probably.  This area just kind of feels like an attempt at a correction that wasnt entirely successful.You also roamed pretty far afield with your colors .. unless that was better rum than Ive ever had.  Again nothing wrong with that.  I prefer a vibrant color palette that gives the artist some wiggle room but strictly speaking we were aiming for somewhat realistic colors in this exercise.  This painting would definitely fit right in with Exercise  though.Again  glad you joined us.  I noticed you linked to a tumblr upload  whats your tumblr username?,watercolor101,d73f7fs,1,t5_386h6
8856433,0,t1_d7c1ufu,Wow! These look really great!  I like the texture that youve added to the different items with seemingly very few brush strokes. And i really love the lid sounds funny to say but my eye is drawn to it. ,watercolor101,d7cf278,2,t5_386h6

9090613,0,t3_54pwtv,I am also an art beginner in watercolor. I cannot thus offer good critique except to simply say that if I had produced this as a beginner Id be incredibly proud of myself and I hope you are too.,watercolor101,d84jmnu,4,t5_386h6
9350115,0,t3_58f21c,I think this is beautiful. Her eye really captures my attention and really pulls me in. Like uoetker said though something extra couldve been done in the lower right but overall I like this lots. ,watercolor101,d9170yg,2,t5_386h6
9946711,0,t3_5hutma,This looks pretty good to me.  Im an amateur as well when it comes to watercolor.  It does look like it needs more color depth to it to make it really pop.  But other than that solid job!,watercolor101,db42y91,1,t5_386h6
