1901836,0,t3_2ge7zq,Rent to own would be more of a townhouse situation Im guessing and it sounds like you dont have the time right now to invest in looking for something like that.  My niece has lived by Rio in Gaithersburg in both the garden apartments and now in the new highrise they just built there and I think her rent at both places is around what your budget is  and both places were very nice and REALLY conveniently located theyre just building a ton of stuff over there  restaurants a brand new Harris Teeter etc.  If I were looking to rent with your budget thats the first place Id go.  The garden apartments were in the area of Marathon TerraceMarathon Circle on google maps its . ..Since youll probably only be obligated to sign a lease for one year at a time thatll give you enough time to find something more suitable for owning without having to rush that process.

Not limited to residents for everyone.  If the permitted area expands then obviously that changes but thats how it is for now and it doesnt make sense to pretend otherwise.  We all pay our taxes that fund road construction same as you.Also I dont think that some extra cars along the street in a neighborhood when all of the residents are gone for a day of work anyway matters that much.,MontgomeryCountyMD,cn99xna,1,t5_2sac3

2995450,0,t1_co8g3iw,Nancy Navarro councilmember from my area has run unopposed the last  dem primaries and in the current climate Dems are going to win every seat.  There arent even options to vote these people out.Council is  people and they are supposed to represent a population of over a million. That just seems crazy. and in terms of seeing liquor money as revenue that is a big problem for me. This isnt a business the goal is not to maximize revenue and that is a big problem with peoples attitude towards government in this area. You know what else would increase revenue treating gasoline like liquor you can only buy gas from county owned gas stations that would bring in a ton of revenue.the county spend over  a year per student to educate them.

Again I have no clue myself but it seems that the general consensus is that it doesnt matter the tool its how you use it.
