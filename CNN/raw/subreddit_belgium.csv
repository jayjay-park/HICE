917369,0,t3_24m0w8,Part of it is tradition. Most new politicians and a lot of established ones have no real clue about marketing. Most only start thinking about convincing people when the campaign starts. Its typically too late then. So youre a candidate. What do you do? Most have no answer so they just do what others did and what happened in the past. You are more likely to vote for someone whose face you have seen. Even more for someone you have actually met. At least thats the theory. So you go out meeting everyone and smiling shaking hands. You give them a flyer of your face and what you stand for so they dont forget. The flyers in other peoples windows work as social proof. Other people share my opinion. Plus the rules about what you can and cant do during a campaign are incredibly dated. Its often quite hard to figure out what is and what isnt allowed. As for the program... Im sorry but that doesnt work. There is a very small group of voters that actually reads and compares programs. Most of these are party members. The programs are for internal consumption for journalists and for candidates to know what the official point of view of the party is. The current system heavily favors people who are already very well known before the campaign starts. One of the big issues is the apathy and disinterest of the average voter... ,belgium,ch8k77b,2,t5_2qhe6

I agree that getting closer to getting elected makes people more likely to vote for a party which is self reinforcing up to a point of course if everyone thinks enough other people will vote for a party to get elected then that can have the opposite effect see Agalev I wasnt happy with them in  but not that unhappy that I wouldnt have considered switching my vote if Id realised they were losing that many votesOld textRight the point is that you assume relevant gt viable but Im not sure that it follows. I dont think LDD was ever viable and never thought they were even though they had seats. If I was of the opinion that they were relevant because of those seats then Im still not sure how it follows that Id have considered them viable.Of course I guess it also depends on the meaning of viable I thought you meant that the party has a chance at long term success depending on the meaning of success not short term successrelevancy.For the latter case yes the party being so close to getting seats in most provinces makes them more viable because people do vote tactically.,belgium,chnrxy0,1,t5_2qhe6

As far as Ive seen the outcome of the elections  counted most people that did agree last elections still prefer the way it has been.Where people did not agree they went to the Groen party.The only BIG difference is that we now have a more united right wing where LDD and Vl. Belang got sucked up by the NVA.So people still think the same way as  years ago..I personally believe a program such as the NVAs will make it much worse for a lot of people.Lowering social security forcing people to go work for minimum wage and with no social benefit minijobs. Pushing them further into povertymarginality. Thus resulting in more drugsuse violence and theft. Suppressing this with more cops cameras burgerdienst... should fix that? This looks more or less like a downward spiral to me.The whole idea of forcing people to work is nice if it would work. But it has been shown that a lot of people do not magically get a job when you cut their unemployment check. And Im happy to pay taxes. I dont mind. As long as theyre used to help people build roads provide us with all the nice citys we have now.Not to build big footballarenas organise Olympic games buy armytoys etc...Id rather have a thousand people not in need profit from my taxes than to have one slip trough the maze an not get anything while in need. Ive worked my way up and make a fair wage... I wont even notice if some party gives me  Euros a moth extra. ok my boss would notice the cut of social security.Ive read the program and I dont believe in it.

Very messy and much less likely to find sympathy in the eyes of the international community. A splitup along predictable lines is unwelcome but acceptable if the de facto situation can be regularised. Secession of tiny splinters of territory based on petty grievances will not be as easily recognized.

1348769,0,t3_29itn5,As a Belgian who has been the president of a student exchange organisation for the Brussels university I can give you the following insight. Indeed Charleroi isnt one of the most attractive cities in our country. It tends to be notorious so just try and be carefull. But knowing our culture and lifestyle youll probably enjoy it! Belgium is a very small country so train trips of about an hour can take you to some of the beautifull cities in our country ghent antwerp bruges brussels. Using a go pass this costs about  euros. Also most people are proficient in English Id say about  and are very helpfull if you just ask for help. If youre affraid you wont have a good time with the natives Belgium is filled with international students and is a mixing pot of different cultures and religions. Also we tend to have the best beer in the world so... I can also add that the  US students we hosted over the years all loved their stay in Belgium.

1555074,0,t3_2c280f,Well it will never end since its a basic human weakness were some political parties take advantage of to get electoral success. It happened before and it will happen again until the end of time.In this specific case of the reemerging of nationalistic tendencies all over Europe is the result of a loss of identity and national project when all that is left is economic growth. And to counter that people go back to the identity they know an identity of the past which makes these parties nationalistic conservative. They try to go back to a time that never existed by creating and defining an ideal past or by making up a story that everything which hinders the economic growth of an area should be put outside of that area. In the flemish case you can see both tendencies at work.This is of course the great paradox because this kind of thinking never offers any solutions and never will since its a movement that feeds on resentment and not on a strong affirmative power to create something new. So the same thing will happen over and over and the next generation can blame the one before that and do the same all over. Its just a narrative made up to hate imaginary people so a certain elite can take advantage of this hate.You see people discussing these problems in cafs all the time etc. but who really knows anything about politics who has the economicsociologicalpolitical understanding to know how anything works? Ive met very few people who actually did. Until the normal person in the street has no idea how certain societal problems function they can get tricked into these seperatistic policies cause they know something is wrong hell everybody knows something is wrong but look over there there is a man with an easy solution who knows how to get  to our emotions and stomach feelings. And ss long as you cant acces a problem with intellect and go with these emotions these two are hard to define and not always seperate people will try to take advantage of that.The only way to move this kind of thinking to the background is to have prosperous times so its harder for these people to take advantage of the population on their weakest.,belgium,cjb7aan,8,t5_2qhe6

1680401,0,t3_2dmf2k, golden advice I can give you DONT GO TO CARREFOUR EVER!! Seriously do yourself a favor and try to go there as little as possible. Ive known  people who have each worked in a different carrefour. Both their bosses in the meat section forced the five seconds rule upon their employers. Oh you dropped that steak onto the ground? No problem! Just make sure no one sees you when you pick it up and package it! Soooo unsanitary....I have bought a pack of minced meat three times there.  out of the  times the meat had gone bad on the inside so invisible when you buy it. This is clearly a sign that they are messing with their expiration dates and that they are spraying the meat with some mix of additives so that the meat will still look good on the outside.Fruit and vegetables arent any good either. The quality is considerably less compared to other supermarkets and they once again try to trick their costumers. For example they regularly put grapefruits with the oranges on pupose because oranges are more expensive so the customer will pay more than he should and he will only discover his mistake when he gets home. Another example The containers with golden kiwis. They porpusely package some green kiwis in there as well even though the label says that there are exclusively golden kiwis inside. Once again they make more profit since golden kiwis are more expensive than green ones and the customer only discovers this when he gets home...I cant believe they didnt already have to pay some sort of fine of something...,belgium,cjqz70l,2,t5_2qhe6

Also the Thalys trains are very profitable there is no need to make tickets far more expensive.

3335693,0,t1_cp8f97c,I think your first point hit it pretty good. It should be a free country and if people want to put money in uplace let them do it.There is definitely a crowd for shopping centers. The point that you dont like it and me for the record is irrelevant.The traffic problems that come with it can be solved. In Belgium we are used to have traffic jams so I doubt it will be worse than what we are used to.  Local businesses If we are not allowed to build anything new for the sake of existing economy we would still be hunting for our food ...The biggest problem for uplace is that ofc the people in Vilvoorde dont like it.

De regering de enige die beslist wat de nmbs moet doen wil dat treinen op tijd rijden met consequenties als bepaalde stiptheid niet behaald wordt maar wat betreft snelheid zegt ze niets dus je oogst wat je zaait.En wat betreft de dienstregeling zolang elke regering op haar beurt geld gaat zoeken bij de spoorwegbedrijven bij elke besparingsronde en ook steeds haar politiek juist gekleurde vrienden in vette postjes aan de top ervan blijft neerzetten gaat het er nooit op vooruit gaan.,belgium,cplczcw,10,t5_2qhe6

3462014,0,t1_cpmtj1o,Ok. Consider the following situation then you are being handcuffed in front of your house for all your neighbours to see. This was based on the sole testimony of one neighbours kid.   He sounds quite convincing you made him touch you. The police drag you away and for  hours you are held. Youve been arrested as a suspect of pedophilia. However the neighbours dont get to hear your version. They only get the local newspapers version and the parents of the kids account. The local newspaper wants to sell a juicy story. ManWoman caught molesting neighbourhood children. The parents are naturally protective and very much believe their child. They start talking hoping to find more people on their side.You a single manwoman have been living on your own and havent had much contact with the neighbours. Speculationgossip is a powerful thing here. It doesnt take much for the neighbours the people who think just like you to jump to conclusions. You are a disgusting pedophile. Youve destroyed any innocence the sweet little kid had. The kid that would ride his bike around the neighbourhood every Sunday. But not this one. And maybe not the next. Not long after you are allowed to return home. You are in shock that this is happening to you youve never done anything wrong before so you decide not to go out for a while. When youve finally recollected yourself you decide to go see the supermarket and buy some groceries. On the way there you hear passersby angrily remark why isnt he in jail?. You brush it off. They dont mean you. Youre innocent right? You know youre innocent. At the supermarket you smile and wave to the cashier. You always smile and wave to the cashier. They always smiled back. This time they didnt. They mustve been to busy to see you tell yourself.Later you go to your local bar to meet a friend one of the few that replied to your messages for a drink. Get the whole trial out of your head for a second. Upon entering the bar you hear a man whisper to his wife Oh look. See? I told you the system doesnt work. At that moment you could start shouting from the top of your lungs claiming your innocence until your voice fails you. But would it be of any use? All these people have already investigated the case already weighed the evidence. Theyve already judged you. And they find you guilty. ,belgium,cpmw7tm,2,t5_2qhe6

This creates a situation where you buy a number of shares of the fund that is inversely proportional with the price you buy more shares when the price is low and less shares when the price is high.I dont know if you have a lot of liberty in the choices of funds if you could create a fund basket to diversify etc. It seems to be  monthly payment towards  fund. In the same optics you would have KeyPlan from Keytrade Bank that allows you to do monthly payments to a basket of funds you choose regarding of your interest risk profile etc. I did not yet invest in this but I do really like the idea to be able to choose my own funds and invest freely in it.,belgium,cqra41p,1,t5_2qhe6

3903823,0,t1_cr19ii7,Second. When youre obeying the law youre more predictable.People expect you to move over to the right lane when there is an obvious opportunity so when you dont this leads to confusion which is dangerous on a highway. For example someone might be in the middle lane m behind you and slowly closing in and they see a bunch of faster cars coming up in the left lane. If he sees that you cant go back to the right lane he might decide that this is the time to switch lanes so he switches lanes the cars behind him have a lot of time to brake and everyone overtakes you without issue. On the other hand if he sees that you will have room in the right lane he might decide to keep closing in on you. When it then turns out that you stay in the lane illegally the cars on his left are a lot closer so when he gets close to you he has to either brake possibly surprising people behind him or move to the left lane last minute surprising the people in the left lane. Its just dangerous for no good reason.Also staying in the middle lane invites people to overtake on the right which is even more dangerous.

On the other hand the Netherlands has a pretty good history for supporting rather than suppressing the various regional identities and continues to do so.If there will ever be a union it would definitely need to have a federal character allowing the Walloons to continue speaking French and the Luxemburgers to continue speaking Luxembourgish. And we would have to distribute official institutions among various cities as I dont think we could ever agree on a single capital city. I think it would be pretty good for the other regions of the Netherlands too as the Belgians and Luxembourgers would then provide a counterbalance to the dominance of the Hollanders. ,belgium,cr3fkcd,1,t5_2qhe6

A big part of the train personnel isnt that fond of the regular big unions anymore with their random strikes for things that noone was really quite sure what they were about and while almost everyone wanted to work noone could since they blocked the tracks while all the issues they have were completely ignored by these big unions. So now we have this train driver union that has proposals that a lot of the train drivers can relate to.In my depot theyre virtually nonexistent but other depots have switched almost entirely to ASTB last year. Its as big as a guess for us what will happen that day.

4016206,0,t1_cre29dw,These things happen to me daily. Nearly daily at least. My route to work is only ish kilometers. So about  total and I swear there are multiple days in the week where I have what I can call close calls.  People ignoring red lights. People overtaking on the right. People being impatient because you refuse to go over the speed limit while overtaking trucks on the E. Trucks overtaking other trucks in areas where they arent allowed to do that during that timeframe and barely look out for cars overtaking them. Trucks swerving because theyre busy doing anything other than driving while youre overtaking them.  In extreme cases  has happened to me before  people overtaking you on the shoulder because God knows why.   Cyclistspedestrians crossing the road without looking  seriously this happens daily  and doing so from behind parked carstrucks so you have no fucking clue that they might potentially do something stupid just then and there.  These days when I see anyone on the sidewalk facing the road looking back and forth even if there is a crosswalk  meters away from them I am assuming that they are about to cross regardless of that. Because if I dont one of these days Im going to end up killing someone because of their carelessness.  It is crazy out there. Not sure if it is just my route. The part of the E I drive on is full of truckscars from Romania Poland Estonia Netherlands. It seems foreigners are even less likely to abide by the rules because they dont feel accountable at all and in many cases they arent.   Not exactly easy to get your money from a speeding ticket issued to a Romanian citizen. So why should they care about speeding right?Oh and in my own street apparently people love ignoring right of way. Theres a couple side streets where it is obvious you have to slow down to give right of way. But apparently nobody cares. So whenever I slow down to make sure nobody is coming  since people DO take their right of way there  I have to pray to God whoever is behind me is paying attention. Its not the first time I hear my parking sensors go off because whoever was driving behind me was grinding my bumper because how dare I drive the utterly ridiculous speed limit of  kms an hour in a street with  fucking schools during rush hour where the school kids are swarming through. Knowing there is a crosswalk right after a turn  making it difficult to know there is about to be one  that is quite dangerous but the local government doesnt do shit about despite letters asking them to.

Youre always free to negotiate with your employer to get a raise anyway its not outlawed. If your situation is that grave maybe he will understand it and give you a raise to compensate inflation.Also its not necessairily food thats driving up inflation. Last I read most food actually became cheaper and it were more materialistic consumer goods driving up the prices.gt and my financial aid for university will go downYou keep saying this but this is not true. Normal tuition fees go up but the scholarship system remains untouched. Your aid will not go down unless youre such a bad student that you fail to get the necessiary results in which case they might pull away your aid.gt But I highly doubt youve ever been in a financial situation where  euros can make a huge differenceYou dont know me stop assuming things about my life. I had to pay my kot and all the food I consumed there myself that was a situation where  euros did make a huge difference for me.

Your proposal eliminates labour tax so the first point is void. However the second point is important because where things are produced is where things are going to flow. Lets use the example of China as an example which will probably never agree to this.

But breaking up a contract is still easier than breaking up a marriage.Last but not least there is a thing that I cant explain. I had several long term relationships gt years in which I was happy and wanted to settle and start a family. I never intended to marry it was not necessary in my eyes because it was nothing but a promise could be broken later anyway grown up with divorced parents. When I started my current relationship there is something off. Its hard to put into words but its as if I knew in advance that this would be the person with whom I wanted to spend the rest of my life. I actually made up my mind within the first week when we got together. I know hormones and stuff do crazy things to your judgement but I never had felt this before Im  at the time of writing. I wanted recognition of our relationship and celebrate that with the people im close with. Living together or make up a contract wouldnt even come close to that. I wanted to express my love and commitment in the traditionel ways my ancestors did. Bonus points None of our sibblings are married or intend to even though they started families already. When we announced we saw a huge relieve in our parentsgrandparents eyes because they were afraid none of their childrengrandchildren would marry. I didnt realize was this important to them as well as if they were waiting for someone to officially continue their legacy.I hope this somewhat awnsers your question,belgium,cu07ad3,2,t5_2qhe6

Best thing is city council decided not to move the lines underground after too many people refused to move the lines underground on their property.

Honest question.I personally dont I think we should always sustain a base level of selfsustainability. And theres a cost to that and the farmers arent the ones that should pay it.

Id love to see true night trains in Belgium but after the rush hour ends in the evening a lot of trains are almost empty.I think this is sort of a chicken and egg problem. Ive taken the last train out of Brussels to go back home once delayed Eurostar and it was an erm interesting experience drunk chavs getting kicked off the train by the treinbegeleider in Lede for not having a ticket and a weirdo trying to sell everyone chocolates. It was however mostly empty. Ive definitely also noticed that rightfully so outside rush hour trains are either shorter or different material alltogether KnokkeBlankenbergeHasselt being operated by a set of MS instead of the usual HLEM combo for instance.Which also leads me to somewhat of a related question does the fee the NMBS pay to Infrabel for the rijpaden depend on the composition of the train or is it just a flat fee irrespective of whether the train has  carriage or ?gtIm not saying privatization or liberalization is bad but you need a government that has a vision for better public transport. If theyd have one we could end up with a great railway network even with the NMBS and if they dont well end up with bad service whatever happens. And right now our government doesnt seem to care about public transport at all.Fully with you on that. Though it seems like our government doesnt care about the massive traffic jams that are on our roads either so at least it doesnt care about both issues evenly I suppose. The way I see it the best way to convince people to take public transport is making it a convenient option. Ofcourse youll always have several crazy people that prefer to sit in a traffic jam for hrs instead of taking the train. Next week for instance I have to be in Lige all week for for work. Hells no that Im driving there definitely not doing that during rush hour. Conversely when driving is the quicker option Ill obviously drive. I also find taking the train considerably more relaxing compared to sitting in a traffic jam so in that sense Ill always take the train over sitting in traffic. ,belgium,cxu2z6j,2,t5_2qhe6

Its not really that they feel entitled for life more like you can hardly have another job than in the NMBS in Belgium if you are a train conductor so people who have their human capital invested in conducting trains who have passed the harsh tests and gained experience are especially vulnerable because they have no alternatives.

Much like most of the gender pay gap is explained by taking nonfinancial benefits like commuting time into account.Choosing what to repeat and what to omit also reveal an ideological bias and an agenda.

What happens in reality is that company A makes a price and sends a request to a B and C company to offer that price . knowing that they always be the cheapest company A can request almost any price they want. Same goes with leasing contracts. We know our departments have a limited budget. So what happens instead of buying the good they need they let a external company buy it and have a leasing contract on that good. In such way that the external company earned its investment back in two years while the lease keeps running for x amount.

He also claims an investigation into jihadism in the Belgian military was blocked in order not to stigmatise the muslim population in the army.gtIk beschuldig Belgi ervan jarenlang een wachtenkijktoepolitiek te hebben gevoerd en nooit zijn geheime diensten de middelen heeft gegeven om hun werk professioneel te doen en dergelijke aanslagen te voorkomen. Ik beschuldig politici ervan dat zij nimmer de opkomst van de radicale islam hebben willen begrijpen. Zij hebben die dreiging bewust genegeerd want ze waren bang voor stemmenverlies en dat ze werden afgeschilderd als politiek niet correct.gtSnoeck zegt dat de politici door hun houding jarenlang toestonden dat meerdere Belgische steden ten prooi vielen aan jihadisten. Het kwam zelfs tot het punt dat een socialistische leider mij vertelde We kennen het probleem in Molenbeek maar wat wil je dat we doen. Het is een electoraat dat we niet kunnen negeren.gtVolgens de oudinlichtingenofficier kampen de Belgische inlichtingen en veiligheidsdiensten met een chronisch gebrek aan geld getrainde mensen en kennis. De diensten zouden volgens hem incompetent zijn geworden door de politieke benoemingen van chefs om enkel de reden dat zij behoorden tot de juiste politieke kleur. Die politieke correctheid is er zelfs de oorzaak van geweest dat een volgens Snoeck noodzakelijk onderzoek naar jihadisten binnen het Belgische leger werd geblokkeerd alleen om de moslimpopulatie in het leger niet te stigmatiseren.

7092399,0,t1_d1k83jv,The NYPD has  separate patrol boroughs and  precincts But they are under a single political authority namely that of the Mayor of NYC.This single political authority is what is lacking not only in Brussels but in the whole of Belgium note that the entire population of Belgium is not much bigger than that of NYC. The trouble is not that there are several police zones in Brussels the needs and challenges of patrolling UccleUkkel are not at all the same as those of Molenbeek and it makes sense to have some sort of organisational subdivision. The problem is that each of those police zones works as a small fiefdom responding to a different local lord. But this is not a problem limited to Brussels and I insist the biggest gravest communication breakdowns have not been between police zones in Brussels but between different police authorities in the whole of Belgium and between Belgium and foreign security services.Pointing fingers at the small clusterfuck in governance that is Brussels is merely a diversion from the bigger clusterfuck in governance that is Belgium as a whole which is the responsability of politicians that for decades and purely in the interest of their personal advancement and of creating jobs for the boys have continuously been hollowing out any form of central authority or even supervision pushing for ever more devolution and dispersion of responsability.

They dont want a position and will try to trade out of if before the end of the day. They are basically there to provide a market bid and ask prices and they capture the spread. They are not interested in upward or downward movement. This kind of trading activity is highly specialized and desired by the exchange who want to offer members the ability to always trade in and out of positions in a twosided market so they offer exchange fee exemptions for market makers that are able to show quotes in many markets for the majority of the time e.g.  or . ,belgium,d1r62rv,1,t5_2qhe6

The sole purpose of a political party is to legislate voting for a party is giving it a democratic mandate to legislate and to govern. The main function of a union is to solve conflicts on the work floor thats what people join unions for. If the unions also try to influence politics they can not use their membership count as an argument as their main fuction is not to do politics and thus their members do not necessairily consent to the unions political agenda. Unions quite simply lack the democratic mandate that elected political parties have.gt Were really not anywhere close to the unions designing our labor policies. gt Belgium has a particularly strong practice of sociaal overleg where employees and employers reach an agreement on labor circumstances and the government generally just rubber stamps it.So... we actually are close to the unions designing our labour policies.I expect my government to govern not to rubberstamp what a  bunch of nonelected lobby groups decide.

We had sustained growth despite the social negotiations not thanks to it.

People should be free to do with their money what they want.You got some money on the bank? Youd probably be the first to complain when the government decides to invest your money.gt just like you require people to be forced to work even they want to strike.Actually I do think people should be allowed to strike just not when their striking interrupts the order of society either by bringing people in danger prison guards docters firemen... or by making it impossible for other people to perform their profession public transport energy production....gt if theyre that vital then you should pay more consideration to the concerns of the people running themThe people running them need to understand they have a certain responsability towards society.

Two major differences with slavery. And if minimal service is slavery then you should sue France to the ECHR because they do have minimal service in public transport.

That crosswalk is  meters away from a busy crossroads right in the middle of the town. Ive had drivers coming with their turn signal on from across the crossroads so naturally I think theyre gonna go to the right before the crosswalk and its safe for me to go but no they activated their turn signal way too soon because theyre turning after the crossroads. And they use their horn like Im the one who made a mistake. Ive had drivers still  meters away from the crosswalk see me right there waiting for someone to slow down so I can cross and those drivers actually accelerate.Ive had drivers coming from the road to the left stopping at the crosswalk allowing me to cross the street but from the right comes a guy who sees whats going on but simply does not wish to stop. The car on the left stops I step on the crosswalk but the car on the right does not give a shit is way over the speed limit and just keep going on like Im not even there. Oh and heres the kicker  that damn crosswalk is  meters away from a school literally next to the town hall and I kid you not the freaking police station is right in front of it. Its maddening really.Its been a while since Ive taken that crosswalk now I walk a bit further away and I cross where theres less traffic and funnily enough no crosswalk.

Lack of alternate business models to monetise quality content that doesnt hamper the user experience amp expectations. Paywalls? Consolidation of a market where only a handful of players have a quasi monopoly and hold the lion share of the attention. Small publishers go out of business because lack of a broad audience which generates enough revenue. Private equity drives to publish the most profitable content. Not the content which is intellectually or even ethically more relevant for us. As someone said  year old journalists dont decide what gets published.,belgium,d52qyxy,3,t5_2qhe6

The supplied documentation is difficult to understand for me at least as Im not very good in that legalisefinancialbullshit bingo and boring but it can be well worth the effort to find out whats deductible and whats not. In case of beroepskosten. You automatically have the fixed rate which is fine for most people but you can chose to prove your true costs if you believe theyre higher. Off course you need to be able to prove these costs that means keeping receipts and logging your costs and receive no compensation from your employer for those costs made and your employer must be willing to agree with the fact those costs were necessary for you to do your job. It can be things like your car usage and attached costs like maintenance insurance   cell phone usage internet connection education clothing books business lunches home office   It depends on your job off course and if not only work related like a cell phone you cant deduct the full cost.

9069362,0,t1_d818l0o,I think the problem is a very untransparent way of organising taxes. All taxes end up on one giant heap which then gets divided amongst all expenses which makes some parts profitable and others a loss. Each sector should get to decide their own taxes to cover their own costs taxes for transport should go to road maintenance and public transport taxes on wages should go to pensions and social security taxes for using public utilities should go to maintaining the public utilities.  Obviously this ends up on one tax bill but whenever you move a responsibility to another level you can just move the tax responsibility with it. If a sector can work more efficient then they can lower their taxes without affecting anything else. Extra advantage is that everyone can see what exactly theyre paying taxes for and how much.That would be a proper tax shift in my opinion.,belgium,d81zo1v,1,t5_2qhe6

Separatist is just a word for someone who desires selfdetermination from a nation that doesnt allow this. Obviously some people try to obtain this in different ways but once you have established that some people desire this selfdetermination completely ignoring them or even going further by trying to eradicate their culture for nearly a century youre bound to get some aggression.In Belgium in particular we have dealt with something similar to not exactly the same ofcourse. We were lucky that the culture being oppressed was the majority in our country and thus any attempt to subjugate us backfired and we literally kicked them out of our cultural territory and managed to get full recognition of our culturelanguage about  years ago.From what Ive read its starting to improve now in Turkey at least a little bit. But the desire to have their own nation in itself is something that needs to be recognised. As long as you dont do that youll have to deal with the violent outbursts this causes. Civlian targets are quite obviously always bad ofcourse.gt I know most of the Europeans symphatize with YPGPKK because they fight ISIS in Syria but things are not like that in Turkey.You couldnt be more wrong.

9859698,0,t1_darpl9i,Wonderful thank you! Ive always had bad stomach achesproblems ever since I was a little boy. My stomach aches got substantially worse after I took a high dosage of a drug called accutane when I was about  years old as a last resort to getting rid of severe acne. My acne is long gone but the bad weekly stomach aches never went away. I stay away from dairy products which helps. Doctors have taken blood work and stool samples and they say theres nothing wrong with me. I have had regular bowel movements on a daily basis and still have painful diarrhea once a week without fail ever since I finished my high dosage regime of Accutane. My Grandma has stomach problems like me and she eats prune amp drinks prune juice daily at the ripe old age of  years old to help her out. I decided to give prune juice a chance since nothing else was working. Now I can drink . cups of prune juice and  hours later my stomach clears itself out painlessly. Ill still have bowel movements throughout the week but I also clear myself out every Wednesday amp Sunday. This has stopped the weekly painful episodes of once a week diarrhea. Before accutane I probably had painful diarrhea once every two weeks. The doctor said its ok for me to drink . cups of prune juice twice a week and that it wont harm me. I really think I have IBS but the doctors say nothing is wrong with me after blood work amp stool samples. Well I dont think most people have painful diarrhea once a week for years either but fuck what do I know. So now I just drink my . cups of prune juice twice a week and it truly is a godsend that Im not in pain amp sweating over the toilet anymore.  Trust me the doctors pissed me off when they said nothing was wrong with me because who the hell wants to have terrible bouts of painful diarrhea at incontinent times on a consistent basis throughout their lives?Sorry if that was too much info lol.,belgium,dasqpla,1,t5_2qhe6

While there is always a component of risk all historical data indicates that investing in a wellconstructed index i.e. balanced fractions of stock from hundreds of companies will give average longterm gains that vastly exceed any fixedincome product and that can recover from crashes. The wellconstructed aspect is important. The BEL was objectively a hideous investment because its so financeheavy and if you bought in right before the crisis it will likely take decades more to recover. Thats not the case for the popular American indexes. Theres a study on how youd have come out on top buying into the market at any point even right before the Dotcom bubble if given enough time. The usual past returns caveat applies but any situation where the global economy tanks to such an extent that this is no longer true would crash all investments beyond those in precious metal and firearms.You dont buy stocks with money you need for a house in  years because if the markets crash and lose  you cant afford to keep that money in the market and wait for it to recover. You can do that if you dont need the money for another  or  years.If youre that riskaverse Medirect has an ME savings account thats still at around . I think. Theres a month withdrawal delay. There are a few accelerated savings accounts at some banks that let you park small amounts of money at rates that beat savings accounts. Beyond that theres basically nothing. Our screwedup tax system and the abysmal rates on fixedincome products means that you need to be in stocks with the majority of your longterm investments to beat inflation let alone grow your capital.

Crimes against state security murder torture and war crimes. Also war crimes dont explicitly need a legal text so called nuremberg clausule.I doubt CdampV would have an issue with this and if they do then fucking force them. Organise protests have a referendum i dont care just get the scum of the streets.gt You arent going to stop such an attack thats close to impossible to stop. If someone gets it into his head to do such an attack stopping him no matter what budget you give to the police is very hard.Should we stop the war on rape since you cant stop all rapes from happening? should we cut funding of Vice units? Read some of the interviews with Bxl counter terror on Paris attack suspects. They lack the most basic techniques that all our neighbourgs have. They couldve stopped the  paris amp bxl attacks from happening if they werent completely drowning in workload.gt The schools my daughters go to have windows falling out but you want to spend extra money on equipment the police never uses? Do tell when this was needed and when did this cause an issue?Police dont wear pants? Also example would be first units on scene not intervening during bataclan massacre as dozens were being executed because lack of material. Or GCSU having to go beg French GIGN for Flashbangs becase they didnt have any left for the Verviers raid.Just because you think our government is doing shit as far as education doesnt mean they should do extra shit somewhere elseTheyre divided budgets. We have one of the highest rate of officers per capita this isnt really a budget issue its a mismangement issue.Jambon wants to change it hes got a competent team but they lack the power to actually change things.

The past few years have strained it and everything it stands for has come into question. There is a huge gap between the EU and its citizens. There is a democratic deficit in the way the Commission is appointed and in the European Parliaments inability to propose legislation. The migration crisis was and still is badly handled. The list goes on. The EU needs deep and comprehensive reforms if it is to endure and truly become a force for good for every European.

10984087,0,t1_decb616,I was going to rant and disagree with you but according to a WEF report it seems we have the rd best system in the worldHere are some other interesting stats that show our tax system is indeed ridiculous.So it seems our educational system is indeed super good but perhaps we pay too high a price to get it.Personal story  I think Belgian schools were pretty bad in the sense that at least back in the day the good and strict schools really took pride in how many people failed because then those who graduated were really the best. It certainly was the case at the Jesuit school I was at. My parents were basically told he sucks take him to another school. Also the fact that  year olds have to take exams on like  different subjects and even failing one stupid niche subjects like geography religion or economics twice makes you have to take the whole year again is just utterly ridiculous. I found the environment utterly soul destroying.I then entered a different school system where they took pride in how many people passed and I my parents told me I became a different person in the space of a few months. Everyone got a lot more guidance and tutoring you could make a much narrower selection of subjects that genuinely interested you. And no I wasnt a special needs child DAlso the range of subjects available at Belgian universities is  was so narrow and unappealing. I studied in the UK back when it was still free and the breadth of subjects available there in  year bachelor courses was just incredible and you can apply to literally hundreds of different universities. The UCAS system was top notch.Personally I wont be putting my kids in the Belgian education system.,belgium,ded0f2g,3,t5_2qhe6

11012624,0,t1_deg8crg,Government has some plans for this actually the plans go way further than that. The term you are looking for is CAR Centraal aanmeldingsregister. This way we can fix the capacity problems for everyone.One problem is that if we push something from above it has to fit everyone. Sadly a school in the middle of nowhere in WestFlanders is way different than the City of Ghent or Antwerp. Most of these more populated areas already have registration systems in place.A second problem is that school dont like to send the registrations beforehand to the government. They like to balance the amount of pupils across their schools most have fake schools they only exist on paper in reality its just one school to gain maximum amount of funding. We are trying to fix this by changing the way how the funding system works. Third problem is budget.

This is because all the current systems have to be maintained and all cuts end up going from the budget for new or improved systems.

It are real currencies used for real transactions although backed by math and not by central banks. Yes they are digital but they are by no means virtual. We are not talking about WoW gold or Amazon points. We are talking about gigantic international networks of computers with more computing power than the top  supercomputers combined that all secure these distrubuted networks.Some factual errorsgtDe netwerken waarop virtuele munten worden verhandeld zijn volstrekt anoniemIncorrect. All exchanges in Europe where you can buy significant amount of these coins require full identification. I often had to provide more personal information than when opening a bank account.Furthermore all transactions within the networks are made public and can be looked up online with no restrictions. If you manage to not to link your identity to your cryyptocurrency account number you can remain pseudoanonymous but that is about it.gtwaardoor ze voor misdadigers een ideaal instrument zijn om louche zaken te financieren en geld wit te wassen. Zo blijken bitcoins een populair betaalmiddel voor wie online drugs koopt.Sure criminals might use it in some cases but the same goes for Euros or Dollars. Furthermore washing the money is extremely difficult mainly due to the exchanges already requiring identification when cashing out.Furthermore the link with IS is complete bullshit btw. This was claimed by a newspaper without any proof and later retracted if I am not mistaking. Guess what their preferred method of payment is... It is not digital but comes in notes printed by central banks.Edit with links  amp Finally it is not genius minister Geuns that came up with these rules but Europe.I suggest everyone wanting to maintain financial freedom to seriously look into these technologies.

It means nothing at all. For a company it is too much of a hassle to hire you when they know nothing of your credentials when they are too difficult to check. Not to mention your degree is often not valid here. Its much easier for them to pick one of the  other Belgian candidates  that have a CV and are well versed in atleast  languages. This is without taking into account the sometimes blatant racism when looking for a job. If your name is even slightly foreign sounding you can already forget it.This is without taking into account the racism you will encounter outside the workplace. Or the fact that like  of all immigrants i know of have the desire to one day return to their own country because they arent happy here. They all underestimated what it exactly means living in a country with totally different culture and traditions.This comes from a guy whos wife has a masters degree and she ended up after we tried for atleast a year finding work cleaning toilets she got slightly better work now.Im sorry for this to all you guys coming here looking for a better life but this is the truth.,belgium,dgmss1f,16,t5_2qhe6
11718709,0,t1_dgo9vkq,gt Speaking of money does anyone know how much it would cost to renovate a house?Depends on what needs to be renovated and what type of material you want to use and how much is needed...If youre on the market to look at houses to renovate you have to familiarize yourself with all of this its what owning a house means.Start with the easier stuff like a kitchen since thats basically just furniture and appliance you hardmount into your house. You can do this for k but me personally Im looking to install an ovenstovetop that costs k in itself. You can have cheap cheap gluedwoodplanks with laminate on them for cupboards or you can use pure oak with special softclose hinges. A kitchen can just as easily cost k and more.Heating is the same thing is the boiler still good? What about the pipes? If not how much meters of pipes will you need and can the actual boiler handle this? Theres large difference in radiator prices as well and how many you need depends on how large the room is. Roof entirely depends on the tiles and how much m you need. My suggestion for you is to think of the house you visitsed that required the most work. Go room by room and write down what needs to be done than start deconstructing those tasks into material. Go to a proper building store so no fucking Gamma or Brico and look at how much it would cost in material. Multiply that by  because youre bad at this and are underestimating your costs and didnt even include the manual labour involved in this. Than add another  of that price because youre still underestimating.,belgium,dgoceti,1,t5_2qhe6

And neither consists half of our population out of foreigners.Also why dont those below  get anything? You dont think we need to compensate lost child allowance somehow?gt Seconded we are already paying for extra insurances which arnt covered by the social security like the mutual agencies which provides the lower costs for a doctor surgeon or aknowledged specialist and specific caring.So we should just pay for all the other insurance as well then? What kind of argument is that?gt For me and my wife an UBI of  per month plus half time job would cover more then enough for my family and beeing relaxed and well rested plus healthy enough to work untill im boxed and burried. It also would allow to take several risks without worries!Its not because it works for you that it will work for everyone else. Our society doesnt run around you. And no way will you ever get a UBI of  per person per month. If its  it will already be a lot.,belgium,dgsh9oy,1,t5_2qhe6

11802719,0,t1_dgxmrlk,gt The think of the children argument is the death stab of any proper debate and you know that as soon as they invoke it they have no intention of properly discussing the issue.The think of the children debate is irrelevant anyhow with the games being age rated for a mature audience.That being said ban access to something based on age without requiring proper identification and kids will just lie about their age.
