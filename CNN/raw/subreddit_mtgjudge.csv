517216,0,t3_201t7a,The rules on alters are described in MTR .gt Artistic modifications are acceptable in sanctioned tournaments provided that the modifications do not make the card art unrecognizable contain substantial strategic advice or contain offensive images. Artistic modifications also may not obstruct or change the mana cost or name of the card.gtgt The Head Judge is the final authority on acceptable cards for a tournament. In addition the alter must not cause the card to become marked as uthedoh points out. The most common ways for this to happen are if the paint is thick and there is a noticeable difference in thickness or flexibility or if the paint extends to the edge at the top of the card and is visible from the open end of the sleeve.Always check with the head judge.,mtgjudge,cfz27uw,1,t5_2uv8o

1005862,0,t3_25mjjj,So youre playing a total of seven additional turns? An additional turn is awarded for each player as in one per player. That doesnt necessarily mean each player will have one of those turns just that when we start counting turns we count two more. So if AP controls Ral and gets  turns the turn order will go AP AP AP AP NAP AP NAP. Note the terminology difference between additional and extra turns players normally take  additional turns. Ral may cause those turns to be someones extra turns but cant add to the total number of additional turns. Slow play warnings may add to the number of additional turns but does not care who controls those turns. Note that if you do treat the additional turns from the warning as occurring before the normal additional turns the answer is the same. The next four turns will be APs. ,mtgjudge,chimhhu,5,t5_2uv8o

1396783,0,t1_circxgu,Quoting this because i dont think i could put it as well gtBlood Moon and Urborg Tomb of YawgmothgtHere we have two effects that both want to affect land types Urborg wants to make everything into Swamps in addition to their other types while Blood Moon wants to make nonbasic lands into just mountains. And this is an example of dependency both Blood Moon and Urborg want to apply in the same layer but applying Blood Moon first will change what Urborg affects since the Blood Moon will remove Urborgs ability of making lands into swamps. Because of this we can say that Urborgs effect is dependant on Blood Moons effect. So no matter what order they enter the battlefield in we apply Blood Moon first causing Urborg to lose its ability so lands will not gain the swamp subtypeSimilarly spreading seas on urborg.Spreading Seas and Blood Moon are both continuous type changing effects so at that level theyre going to work the same way,mtgjudge,cird8xz,1,t5_2uv8o

2658913,0,t3_2qbp44,Community and respect are two of the values of the Judge ProgramCreating a space where judges of a certain faithculture can come together is not discriminatory or divisive.  In fact such groups should be encouraged and welcomed.  They demonstrate that we are more diverse not less.I understand that it can seem strange even paradoxical for a communityoriented organization like the Judge Program to accept the creation of groups that focus on particular religions or cultures or sexualities or genders....  Detractors of these groups call them divisive.  Why cant we all be one big family?Well quite simply we are one family.  But we each bring very different things to that family.  And while many of us come from majority backgrounds  white straight cisgendered male  many others do not.  It is a great privilege that I generally do not have to consider whether my arguments or experiences will be questioned because well youre just a guy what do you know. And that is just one of example of my own privilege.For people who belong to minority group the default world can be a hostile and unwelcoming place  in many instances at the expense of the minority.  And while unwelcoming is not a word I would typically use to describe the Judge Program there are examples of unwelcoming behavior in this very thread.  I expect that these comments derive from a lack of understanding rather than any malice but even so this only reinforces the point.The world does not need more spaces that cater to the majority.  It does need more spaces where people from marginalized or minority groups can speak openly and honestly with each other.  It would be a grave misstep for us to attempt to silence or stop these efforts.For more on this topic I think the article  Reasons Why We Need Safe Spaces is a good place to start.

So  judges not counting stage staff or the TO.A far as comp it depends on how far I am traveling and what responsibilities I am expected to take on.

SCG brings in another L and comps them the normal L rate plus hotel.  This is a justincase to cover if the HJ is sick or unable to attend at the last minute plus having an L available is handy for testing and having someone to cover appeals during breaks.You end up taking any number of Ls that apply most if not all of the Ls and a handful of the Ls.To get a good sense of what the standard rate for an event like this is check out any of the SCG Open solicitations on JudgeApps.   for one that is pretty near in the future Milwaukee.

6432809,0,t1_czkj30o,Thats super frustrating.  In my opinion the correct response at that point is to write up a draft of new JCC language that says explicitly that every player status suspension of a judge calls for a  independent judge investigation to determine if they should be suspended as a judge with language saying that the JCC should have access to full information used in the WotC investigation  and that WotC failing to provide such information is grounds for the JCC to not suspend the judge from judging.  The reasoning being that even if they are just suspended for  months the JCC wants to do due diligence in figuring out if they should still be a judge at all judges being held to higher standards in general.Id then ship that to Helene and Aaron.  If they object to it then you get to ask some fun questions about where they think the JCC should come down on player status suspensions of judges.  If the JCC cant make independent decisions then any no we did not suspend you is at the very best them being clueless and selfdeceptive.,mtgjudge,czkovgi,14,t5_2uv8o

7135672,0,t3_4d96vs,Like OP we had Triskaidekaphobia draws. A player opened a promo and a pack foil jammed them into a really silly UB millclue deck and went to town. Two of his games went to a draw as a result of the shenanigans. He took second place out of  players. I dont know how many games that card actually won though.We also had some translucent sleeve issues and more than one case of a player putting both the checklist and the flip card into his deck. This was not an good prerelease for new players. Actually none of them are ever great for people totally new to the game. Maybe WotC should push a different event as a way to introduce new players?edit Oh and a pretty dramatic nearshouting match between our judge and a salty player the player was the shouty one. Games went long and there was one where as I understand it they went to turns and one player verbally acknowledged that his opponents deck was much better than his own and he conceded on turn  despite having lethal. Salty player was watching the match and tried to get the judge to DQ them both for collusion. Presumably because edit he thought doing so would improve his own place.,mtgjudge,d1p8wzr,4,t5_2uv8o

7557363,0,t1_d312nf3,Im no lawyer but it seems  while what they were doing originally was okay they went about the naming wrong and then fired people. Thus giving weight to the legal claim they judges are considered contractors. Which means they do deserve to be paid minimum wage plus expenses.If i understand correctly. Edit Also there is the underlining issue of age requirements now being necessary seeing as violating child labor laws could be a big deal.  ,mtgjudge,d318hug,2,t5_2uv8o

Some people have expressed confusion regarding the changes and as they are as logical as you state I feel that should be on the article about the changes. Dont just announce the change announce the reasoning.

9388094,0,t1_d95psrr,If you think ignoring parts of the game rules is inherently a problem I recommend trying to play a game of Magic without doing so. Grab a likeminded friend or at least one willing to humor you and force yourself through a complete game explicitly gaining and passing priority checking SBAs casting spells and activating abilities and doing everything else exactly as laid out in the rules. No shortcuts no glossing over the unimportant bits every phase and step explicitly walked through. You will find it to be a miserable experience.My point with the analogy is exactly what you pointed out the game rules dont concern themselves with anything but their own structure. The practical matter of how two players can implement the game rules and play a game of Magicand have fun in the processis entirely ignored. The tournament rules on the other handwhich are where the shortcut rules come fromare all about those practicalities. The game rules are there to tell you how the utopian ideal of a game is structured and the tournament rules give you the practical framework to actually implement that ideal as best as possible and sometimes that means ignoring the parts of it that cause problems.The combat shortcut is a piece of that practical framework existing as a concession to the inherently faulty and imperfect nature of human communication. Players have different conventions and inclinations for handling combat and what one person says when they mean one thing may be interpreted entirely differently by someone else which creates ambiguity and where there is ambiguity there will be someone trying to exploit it. The combat shortcut removes that potential ambiguity so that it cannot be exploited.gtWhich cost? Nobody want you to get rid of the combat shortcut which will continue being the default way of going through the combat phases in  of the games. You only have to stop punishing the players who  for whatever reason it is not relevant for this discussion  do not want to take the shortcut route.Creating a magic phrase which allows people to bypass the combat shortcut if they want to ends up being the exact same thing as removing it entirelyor perhaps even worsebecause as soon as theres a way to bypass the shortcut it immediately becomes best practice for any shark to exploit the difference by tricking their opponents into messing up the timing however they can whether thats by bypassing the shortcut against a player who doesnt understand the exploit or by seeming to bypass it without actually doing so against someone on guard against the simple bypass. The only way for the combat shortcut to do the job its designed to do is if it cannot be easily bypassed.,mtgjudge,d9609so,1,t5_2uv8o
9388960,0,t3_594pdp,In regaurds to the Ken Ketter RIP ruling Am i correct in my understanding that the judge made an incorrect call? The locked thread had lots of people going back and forth about if you need to announce the trigger after your opponent resolves it and nobody really had a definitive answer.If the judge made the incorrect ruling and ken advanced to some top  or something could a higher judge DQ him after if it is considered cheating?,mtgjudge,d9647ys,4,t5_2uv8o
9549142,0,t1_d9pm976,You arent allowed to discuss splitting for a concession but you are allowed to just divide up the prizes how you like and have one of the remaining players drop leaving the other to be the winner by default.This is a pretty small distinction. The only meaningful difference is that technically that finals round doesnt happen so you wont get PWP for winning it.Heres the actual rules that provide for this exception to the normal bribery rulesgtAs an exception players in the announced last round of the singleelimination portion of a tournament may agree to divide tournament prizes as they wish. In that case one of the players at each table must agree to drop from the tournament. ,mtgjudge,d9q4npq,2,t5_2uv8o

11055883,0,t1_del565o,The rules of magic dont change between the different RELs what does change is our expectation of the knowledge of players and precisely how we fix problems.At both Regular and Competitive REL the combat shortcut functions exactly the same way.  At Regular depending upon the store environment you may resolve confusion by explaining how it works and providing them a doover of sorts to crew at the right time.  At Competitive REL we expect them to already know better and while you still should educate players there are no take backs.Its not the rules themselves that change players should do it correctly whenever possible but the enforcement and expectations do get adjusted.,mtgjudge,del5za4,5,t5_2uv8o
11457367,0,t1_dft1yv5,Its okay that some people be baffled by necessary things like the stack and most of those make sense once you explain them but this was one of those interactions that just sounds like youre cheating when you explain it.  Its like damage on the stack when a new player first sees someone return a creature to hand and then that creatures damage still kills their creature they feel like theyve been cheated and that leaves a sour taste about the entire game.  Theyve gradually been getting rid of those this makes no sense moments and I think its a good thing.,mtgjudge,dfuongh,2,t5_2uv8o
