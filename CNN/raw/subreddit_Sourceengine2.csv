4602533,0,t3_3e202o, Source  will use C as the main language however it will most likely have support for Lua like Source . Would source  be mainly used for d only or also d games? I presume it will be mainly a d engine as that is Valves focas however nothing stops you having a camera such as DotA   Reborns.  Source  should support other platforms. The Source engine has been ported to Android with projects like Nvidia Shield as well as the majority of Valves current titles are available on consoles. With SteamOS coming it would be highly unlikely that Source  does not support SteamOS as Valve has talked about Vulkan being a major part of Source . ,Sourceengine2,ctaqjax,3,t5_30urc

9001601,0,t3_4xjiyr,You mean MetalVKIf it works on windows it SHOULD in theory work on a Mac or Linux. Why I say that is  Their GUI is written in a the cross platform GUI library called Qt and Vulkan as their primary back end OpenGL as a fallback. If Source engines Rubicon physics Library  API is cross platform.I am making some assumptions here ofc about Source  which is not out yet. But in theory It should work on a Windows Mac or Linux PC if the code architecture is correct and the right APIs  Librarys are used. ,Sourceengine2,d7tups7,1,t5_30urc
