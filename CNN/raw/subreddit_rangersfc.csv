4608113,0,t3_3e4jij,Was really impressed by the first  minutes of play tonight and how quickly some of the newer players Tavernier and Halliday especially took to playing as a team considering they havent had much time to gel. The passing movement and the way we dictated the play against a decent English Championship outfit in that period was excellent.The goal was pretty sloppy defensive play but I guess thats what friendlies are for getting the mistakes out before the real stuff begins.Burnley are a much better team than any of the Scottish Championship teams we will face this year so to have played quite well against them only fills me with confidence for the rest of the season.,rangersfc,ctbfpsy,6,t5_2sodi
4641826,0,t1_ctfnx0q,Still refusing to get carried away but I am feeling confident. Just need to make sure we can go to the lesser  teams in the league and win then I will feel more confident. ,rangersfc,ctfo2pt,6,t5_2sodi

5655113,0,t3_3sjxw2, agree with it.The simple fact is that funding would have came regardless. There was a good line of credit still with the banks and full backing of shareholders. This is why ONeill Thompson Roger Mitchell and others believe there should be no title stripping. Money would have been forthcoming without EBTs.This is despite the admission of certain people who knew unethical or criminal activity was going on and did nothing to report it thus acting as accessories.,rangersfc,cwy2lol,8,t5_2sodi

7678508,0,t1_d3ekbgx,Probably I was getting private messages from intelligent masterminds such as fuckthehuns and the Dundee United fan with all the numbers in his username who said Rangers fans were worse than ISIS. Brightened my day yesterday for them to take all that effort into contacting me it really did. The latter guy is still so fucking angry that I and uistillfeelyou screenshotted his ISIS comment and let it do the rounds. Hes still feeling pretty humiliated.,rangersfc,d3f01b3,11,t5_2sodi
7887914,0,t1_d42g3u5,You have to feel if Ally gets a new role then Durrant will be back with him. Fair play to Durrant he accepted his demotion without any grumbling and could have walked when it happened. Hopefully now we can see Auchenhowie producing talent that can challenge for a first team place on a regular basis. ,rangersfc,d42oakn,3,t5_2sodi

9012254,0,t3_53pj8d,Few times when they were a bit disorganised at the back and QotS pressing at the start of the second half seemed to make things difficult. Beyond that the whole team played really well and Kranjcar didnt even slow things down. His vision tonight was absolutely cracking. You see him make balls and suddenly theres just a pass that you never seen from the stands even.Great goals. Couldnt be happier with that apart from maybe six. Unsure how Forrester got a yellow for a  and others didnt but hey ho.QotS brought a great crowd as well more than most teams would bring at the weekend.,rangersfc,d7v4s31,4,t5_2sodi
