920957,0,t3_24n24i,Here are the recipesChocolate cakeMakes   inch layers  cup flour cup cocoa  I use an extra dark cocoa but any will do tsp salt tsp baking powder tsp baking soda cup sugarSift together then add cup milk cup oil eggs tsp vanilla extractStir til smooth then add  cup HOT coffee. Mix up. It will seem runny. Trust me.Bake at  degrees in pans that are greased and floured. I use a circle of parchment in the bottom of the pans as well just to make sure it doesnt tear or stick. It takes about  mins to bake a layer if you divide in   inch pans but check at  mins.Icing sticks butter softened oz powdered sugar. cups unsweetened cocoa powder Hersheys Special Dark Cocoaa pinch of table salt. cups light corn syrup tsp vanilla extract oz milk chocolate chipsMelt chocolate chips in the microwave stirring well every  seconds. Allow to cool for  mins. Combine butter sugar cocoa and salt in a food processor and process until smooth about  seconds. Scrape the bowl as needed. Add the corn syrup and vanilla and process until just combined about  seconds. Scrape the bowl again then add the melted chocolate and pulse until smooth and creamy about  seconds. You can use a mixer for this too if you dont have a food processor just dont whip the butter too much!I find that this icing is easiest to use if it sits overnight on the counter. Just cover in an airtight container. Then mix it up with a mixer to soften up before assembling the cake. Add some instant espresso powder to get more of a coffee flavor.Hope this helps!,Cakes,ch8yvw4,2,t5_2r17v

8769428,0,t1_d71t5l9,Well your glaze is nice and shiny which is great. It just doesnt seem to have run down the side smoothly. If youd iced the sides of the cake as well there wouldnt have been anything to catch on and might have run smoother.Itd probably look great with some decorative chocolate on top too. Some shards or curls or similar. They are quite fun to make and look really impressive when they are all piled up.,Cakes,d71ucsq,4,t5_2r17v

10089138,0,t1_dbjd5ev,This is good advice however I meant the she could have the baker make a naked cake with a minimalistic design or OP could make one since OP may need to consolidate time and effort. I did not mean that OP should should decorate a professionally baked cake.,Cakes,dbmmr1b,1,t5_2r17v
