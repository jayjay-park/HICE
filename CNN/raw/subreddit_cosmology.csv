4521391,0,t1_ct0jmq7,To follow up on udrukath uBanthas straightforward suggestion was among the first hypotheses after the need for dark matter was realized. However after careful observations it was concluded that it was not plausible that dark matter is comprised of normal matter. For example we know that dark matter is distributed throughout galaxies. If the dark matter were dead stars of approximately the same mass as the normal matter about ths of the stars in a galaxy would be dead. Wed notice them passing in front of and obscuring live stars with great regularity.The other simplest suggestions that physicists have made ran into similar problems. So dark matter has become one of the biggest mysterious in modern physics.

7184304,0,t1_d1uqy9g,gt Im certainly not confusing theory with reality. You made a claim and that claim was simply wrong. you told me it was wrong because a theory you have can have a spacetime with no matter. Fair enough as I said you can most certain do a calculation of a flat spacetime if you make the value of G gravity density equal to zero. But I said spacetime does not exist without matter and I know you are a faithful believer in the big bang and I know a part of that faith is that spacetime was created along with all the matter in our universe. You accept that before the big bang if you can put it that way spacetime and even space and time did not exist. So your theory of the big bang supports my claim that without matter and energy there is not such thing as space or time. I was just saying that without matter that takes up space and exists in time there is no concept of space or time. As your BB theory states. So what again is simply wrong you or the big bang or both? Or do you just want to take the opposite argument to me every time?Perhaps you can explain to me how you can measure either the length of space or the duration of time without matter?I would be interested in your explaining that! How are you going to define your two points in spacetime in order for you to subtract all the space and time from those points which are defined in terms of space and time?Or possibly Penrose is wrong with his idea of all the matter in the universe decomposing into light EM energy then as there is no matter massparticles the definition of time and space and size become meaningless. If our universe was composed of only light there would be no such thing as the passage of time or the passage of distance. There is no frame of reference to anything.,cosmology,d1usjm1,2,t5_2r5v1

7657634,0,t1_d3cbngq,We cannot spontaneously create DNA in a lab with a mixture of organic compounds and I never said we could. I said that organic molecules have been spontaneously created in a lab by modeling conditions of the early earth. It would take millions of not billions of years to extend that experiment to spontaneously create DNA. Thats the point its a random occurence. Extremely rare and improbable indeed but again you have  particles sitting around for  years.Having said that DNA was not even created spontaneously that would take an even lower probable event to occur. I said that some molecule that could create crude copies of itself arose. That only needs to happen once for natural selection to proceed until DNA is formed.And you do realize that by calling me wrong youre calling modern science and biology wrong. No serious scientist believes that DNA has some mystical origin. All scientists know that DNA has a physical origin and there are several candidate theories to explain that. Normally I try to be patient with people like you but youre pissing me off with your sarcasm so let me be bluntYou are not and will never be a serious scientist if you think that DNA has no natural physical origin. If you really believe that then you need to work on your critical thinking and consider what others have to say before immediately calling bullshit because it doesnt agree with your religious world view. That kind of thinking will never advance science or humanity in any way in fact it is quite backward. Sorry to tell you but you are wrong on this one. I cant tell you that youre wrong about God creating the universe though it still says something about your critical thinking but youre wrong about DNA you just are. But I know that youre going to respond with some challenge or insult though I dont particularly care so Im not replying again. By the way next time you tell someone that their worldview sounds like something out of Harry Potter realize that your world view is exactly the same with the addition of an omnipotent diety who created the universe because that appeals to you more.

As temperature is reduced to absolute zero it might be thought that all motion ceases and particles come completely to rest. In fact however kinetic energy is retained by particles even at the lowest possible temperature. Due to this Im pretty sure its impossible for a particle to be completely at rest. ,cosmology,dgymaod,1,t5_2r5v1
