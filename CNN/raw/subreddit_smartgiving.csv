148535,0,t1_ceu08li,My intention was less to discuss the plight of America vs. the world than it was to discuss the reasoning behind prioritizing contributions outside of your own community in this case country over that of contributions within. This applies to citizens of every country. Do we bear a responsibility towards our own citizenry over that of other nations?With the notable exception of contributions targeted towards groups with which you have a strong personal affinity canceraidshuman trafficking for which the justification seems pretty obvious.With all humans being essentially equal which I believe you have to choose how to distribute your contributions somehow. Your argument regarding pure ROI is a solid one but I dont think you can completely discount the uplifting effect the combined investment of resources could have if they were targeted exclusively within ones own nation regardless of the relative power of a dollar  also power of a dollar doesnt really matter when you include contributions of physical labor and inkind donations unless youre factoring in opportunity cost maybe? Your statement also brings up another philosophical question for meCan you unequivocally say that it is more valuable to save a life than enrich a life? Is number of lives saved the endall beall of charitable contribution or is it used because it is an easily quantifiable metric with sufficient gravitas?,smartgiving,cevckof,1,t5_2t5ed
