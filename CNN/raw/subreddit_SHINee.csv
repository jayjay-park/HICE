9667147,0,t1_da2p8xs,For me i typically like most all the songs on their albums but a few are a bit forgettable for me. I was worried about the repackage since i havent been feeling SMs ballads lately but i do personally love ballads. I absolutely love all the songs and wish we were getting lives of all of them. Hopefully at the next SWC! ,SHINee,da4ofjq,2,t5_2tmg1
9681937,0,t1_da6g0un,As a pale person who also had trouble with orangey foundation Im going to recommend IT Cosmetics CC in Fair. Its SPF  and medium to heavy coverage but it feels light on the skin. Plus it smells good. If MAC doesnt work for you I highly recommend it. No orangeyness at all!The live slayed btw Key with a jacket on and nothing else had me yelling a bit. Plus Minho with his flaming charisma eyes the entire performance yells.,SHINee,da6i45b,2,t5_2tmg1

Well Im a very rainy area so what did I expect haha.Oh nooo knowing about those two things are very separate.. I mean I was into anime for a couple of years before kpop hit me like truck.Ugh I need to get my ass going and watch Hwarang! Ive been keeping up with Goblin though and I agree.. I cant get into a couple where the younger calls the other Ahjussi... But anything the Grim Reaper does is precious bless him. I want to check out Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bokjoo as well it looks really funny from the screenshots ehehe.,SHINee,dc4d7me,2,t5_2tmg1

11311540,0,t1_dfe4zof,I think the Gucci jacket story was that his stylist accident put it on top of a lighting fixture that burned that jacket. People smelled it and thought something was in a dryer but it was the jacket burning? Thats how I understood his story lol. Still funny regardless how he kept bringing it up over taemin talking. Im not talking about that......... Im not talking about that Aka key stfu not everything is about your Gucci jacket lol. ,SHINee,dfe590m,21,t5_2tmg1
