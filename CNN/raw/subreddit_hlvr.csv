1749469,0,t1_cjyo2ds,Thanks for the reply  still no luck.I think Ive tried everything suggested. I dont even have an option to go to vr mode in settings like when I launch normal half life . Ive done upcoming on the source sdk base  and Ive tried launching from steam vr. Any ideas?,hlvr,cjzoh7n,1,t5_306u6
1799081,0,t3_2f47j6,Any news on whenif hl will support direct to hmd?  I have issues with screen tearing and it didnt seem like low persistence is working with extended mode.  This could certainly be an issue with my set up though. I know this is up to valve and not you guys.Either way thanks for your continued hard work.  I cant wait to play through this once I get low persistence working!,hlvr,ck5xe9y,3,t5_306u6

2032648,0,t1_ckwhkzp,OK Im still having heaps of trouble with this. I cant seam to get it working without setting the rift as the primary monitor. Which is a bit of a pain to swap back and forth constantly. Is this the only way to do it?The Hydras werent working as I think they should have been. Sprint and torch were on the same button for a while then sorted themselves out and my torch was pointed behind me. Jump and crouch were activate on motions not just button presses. And I couldnt see any options related to different hydra control schemes.Also my hydra motion seams to control my headlook as well as my aim. So when I look at the back of my hand to check my health I do a . Feeling pretty sick after maybe  min.  any suggestions?,hlvr,cky705n,1,t5_306u6
2647193,0,t1_cn02qh2,There was a black mesa one as well I wonder where is all went development wise.Im thinking it was dropped as there is no native VR support however as mentioned Vorpx could do the image at least.,hlvr,cn44btk,1,t5_306u6

8868055,0,t1_d7djj31,gt They could suddenly turn round and reveal that was just an elaborate smokescreen but it seems unlikely to me.Maybe not a smokescreen but rather that Valve are going to be subject to changes in plans year to year just as everyone else has been within the VR community.  Also Valve itself has obviously changed in some pretty big ways over the course of the past few years.,hlvr,d7dtdoq,2,t5_306u6
