He wasnt a supporter of the Nazis he was forced like many others. He was lucky enough to have found a way out of fighting for the Germans in the war eventually joining the English military as an intelligence officer which is a really awesome story but not really the relevant part.However when I was younger people found out my grandfather had been a Nazi and so for ten years of my life people used it and slursassumptions connected to the Nazis as parts of their insults directed at me.Do you see the point? People will latch onto anything to add an extra layer of punch to their insults. For me theyd say fucking Nazi for Dan its kike for Suzy Ive seen slut. Its not directly about gender race nationality or anything its about adding something with a derogatory connotation from the list of things we know about the person simply for the sake of making it sound more aggressive.Edit I fucked up the word derogatory somehow.,rantgrumps,ctbzhgd,1,t5_38iu4

Dan on the other hand appreciates the story of a game when he can tell its important ie. any Sierra game.

5366819,0,t1_cvxn9gw,Making ad videos for Crunchyroll or what have you is just double dipping. Youre getting the Youtube revenue from your views and also whatever you were paid to advertise.Putting an ad at the end of the video that isnt otherwise an ad doesnt involve creating content that exists entirely to be an ad. None of Jons videos are ads. Some of the more recent ones contain ads but they are explicitly identified and only happen after the content itself has finished.Just think of the time that it takes for the Grumps to put these ad videos together. The scripting set setup shoots reshoots and editing take a lot of time. Just to make a separate ad video that will itself be monetized.I have nothing against artists making money or even endorsing products. Hell Im a Patron of a few of my favorite LPers and I subbed to Audible to support Jon and also because its a baller service. I have something against artists being obnoxious about it.Like I cant know that the Bishi Bashi Special Vs video is an ad until Ive already clicked on it. And maybe I wanted to watch that video but I have to sit through an ad first and then the Game Grumps ad.

5955334,0,t1_cy094xk,Ill try to break everything down for you.First of all the spread the word to end the word campaign which is the campaign youre referring to was started to both end the use of retard as an insult as well as a medical definition. Retarded never had basis medically. It was a sweeping general term used to describe a number of developmental disabilities such as down syndrome autism schizophrenia brain injuries learning disabilities and a number of other disorders. It was seen as this awful thing a person would be diagnosed as and because it had no medical value there was no further diagnosis and therefore no treatment or aid for any of these retarded people.It was also always used as an insult. It was synonymous with stupidity and idiocy which were also both words used to demean developmentally disabled people. People still use it to this day to insult those with developmental disabilities.By using it as an insult even if its not directed towards a developmentally disabled person you are still comparing the person to us. Youre saying that its a bad thing to be like us that being like us is wrong and worthy of being insulted over. That we are worth less than a person who is not developmentally disabled.So even though the word retard doesnt medically refer to us anymore it still has a connotation with us and is insulting to us because of its history. We dont want it to be used to describe us but it still is and always will have been. Thats why you dont use it even though its not the correct medical term anymore.Its similar to words like cripple or redskin or negro yes they used to be the correct term and even though we do not use them as the proper term anymore they are still insults and are better off not being said.And here is the quote Im referring to. Its from The Office US and is often used by people who try to justify their use of the word. It is not a sound argument for all of the reasons I just explained and its popular enough on reddit that Im sure Ill be hit with it eventually because of my comment.,rantgrumps,cy09wk6,1,t5_38iu4

6057560,0,t3_3yfe5k,I was thinking about this the other day. What does Markiplier have that the Game Grumps dont? To me it is very clearly fan ACKNOWLEDGEMENT. Markiplier is very actively giving updates as to the state of the channel his life his future plans etc. If theres a screwup it is identified and quickly rectified or a reason is given as to why it wasnt. This is some very bare minimum maintainingayoutubechannel level stuff. And of course Mark often goes above and beyond that his Make a Wish vids being a clear testament. But the Grumps dont even do that. Concerns over the quality of content from an entertainment and even technical standpoint the latter being an absolute embarrassment for a channel as tenured and recognized as theirs go either completely unnoticed or are written off as overexaggerated Ross recent trip to the main sub being an example.Really though EVERYTHING keeping Game Grumps at such a sharp plateau boils down to a lack of effort.

6406855,0,t1_czhuwt0,Indeed were only on weekdays only. As much criticism as I give Game Grumps I can admire them committing to three videos a day. Hell just doing one a day can be taxing since its day in and day out editing. Combine that with editing jokes of animations zoom ins and replays and youve pretty much added an extra hour or two of work to each episode. Its not that its hard. It just NEVER ends and requires your constant attention. Before we cut down my computer was always on always rendering and always uploading. Im surprised the internal battery is still good on this laptop. I could make the excuse that were college kids pursuing our education full time while doing this but even then I can see the fatigue of doing daily videos being very possible. Nevermind . Though my firm stance when creating anything is quality over quantity. Having better quality does more for your show then committing to a schedule and I really think Game Grumps should start considering this. I absolutely agree that Chuggaaconroy is an infinitely better example than us. The sheer amount of effort he puts into this videos is staggering compared to any LP channel Ive ever seen. He preplans every single episode and how each of them flow months or even years in advance. He records for hours and cuts it all down into one episode to make it viewable. And he  completes every game he plays. I can only dream of having the insane amount of dedication and excellent execution he has to his work.,rantgrumps,czhw7k6,4,t5_38iu4

6519468,0,t3_44v6bd,The thing about Arin is that you should never hold your breath when he announces something. Its either horribly delayed like his Zelda Sequelitis or it doesnt happen at all. I remember several occassions where he talked about how he is back into animation again or is interested in doing it and nothing happened. Same as I can think of several occassions during AMAs or their Grumpout QampA where he talked about some unspecificied future project that we should look forward to only to be never mentioned again. They announced he would cowrite the next Starbomb and now its like the band never existed. It even seems like Dan amp Brian constantly forget that they have a band with Arin. Thats why Im not excited for the new project Arin talked about on twitter where he showed the concept art. I believe it when I see it until then I just see it as something Arin is excited about now but will abandon once he is bored of it. I dont know if he is totally burned out or something but he totally lost his drive to do more than a few hours of Grumps a week. Its a shame cause he is a talented and creative guy.

Focusing on things and making sure you ration it all out.I mean thats still a stretch for a Zelda game I admit since enemies have drops but...I dunno Id think they did that sort of thing on purpose as a way of saying you wasted all your ammo?

Link and Zeldas relationship was finally meaningful. Link had character and was relatable. The side characters felt like friends and family and really made you attached to them. The obtaining of the mastersword is fun since constantly get new upgrades throughout the game rather than just two different swords one of which you will never make use again. The antagonist was wicked an intersting Demise wasnt either granted. The best thing was simply how alive the story felt due to these interpersonal relationships and the cinematic aspects.

Since the newly established division was so influenced by their headquarters in San Francisco the level designers... decided to make some of the levels as references to well known locations in San Francisco The other levels based off of San Francisco are Mission Street Mission Street is an actual street in the city Radical Highway Route  and Route  the latter three were all based off of the Golden Gate Bridge.Arin Yeah whatever Dan.Dan WeArin FOLLOW ME!!!

With Arin this would have been an unbearable scream fest and if Dan had suggested to skip the part weve seen  times already Arin would have shut him down and wed end up with at least two more episodes of Arin failing at the first part of the factory.The quiet parts were also very nice to hear because it made you feel way more invested in what was going on than say what Arin kept pulling off while Dan was getting super into Inside. Its like he thinks his average viewers have an attention span of  seconds which makes them close the video if he doesnt yell about poopy dick assholes all the time.I also enjoyed Jimmy and Ross together.

I never encountered a glitch whilst playing any version and I have often replayed it for numerous reasons whilst Boom and  still have glitches from the word go.

If they Grumps did adverts while they were playing a game people would have the inverse of this reaction. Theyd be wondering why the Grumps cant just put these ads at the beginning or the end of the video.Ill agree with you that the Inspiration Speeches were grating after the first couple.

9898753,0,t3_5h1ukl,I thought I would hold off from ranting about this recent episode because I figure whats the point in complaining about something that hasnt been created for you.I havent watched Game Grumps in a long time. I cant recall the last episode I watched either I developed different tastes or the content took a really big tonal shift that I just couldnt support anymore. Even when Jon and Arin were at the helm I never wanted them to play Paper Mario because well what is there for them to talk about? Its dialogueheavy features a lot of repetitive combat which requires attention to finesse and the games ooze charm from their combination of beautiful music visuals and atmosphere. TTYD is flawed because of its backtracking and lack of clear instruction for where players should go. The current Grumps appear to struggle even when the game properly illustrates what they should be doing at any given time.But the reason I was so confronted by the episode was the absolute plummet in quality since whenever I last watched the Grumps. Im not going to get flustered about the dicks in the episode title thats just pudding but what I will take issue with is the absolute loweffort content of the episode and monotonous halfhearted approach to the game.The Grumps never used to read out every word the characters were saying in a game let alone act it out more often than not they would just skip the text. This is not much better. With Dan at the helm a selfconfessed terrible video game player who goes along with whatever Arins opinion about something is we can expect to see him talking to nearevery NPC going into buildings of no relevance repeatedly getting lost for a long time  all very frustrating things to watch. The Grumps cannot work out what to do if they skip text neither will they garner an idea if they try to add flair to it by acting it out.There was no enthusiasm in this episode the voices were grating and predictable and just served as padding for the episode. The jokes were asinine the kind of childish crap I would peddle with my friends in Grade  the jokes literally just amounted to doing funny voices and Dan making the same mushroom kingdom joke he always makes and them sexualising female characters. Arin is quite clearly determined not to like this game moaning about every little thing  Jesus fucking Christ does he not enjoy anything? I know theyre called the Game Grumps but it never was a name seriously representative of their attitude. Arin moaned about the graphics about the combat being repetitive about the amount of title screens. How can anyone enjoy that? How is anyone supposed to enjoy watching something that the producers dont even enjoy playing?This series will last three episodes tops. Maybe theyll get up to Frankly maybe theyll fight Gus and lose a couple of times in a row and just discard the game. But if they committed to finishing this series they would undoubtedly be  episodes in before they even reach Hooktail. As an aside I dont feel Ive made very compelling arguments but this episode rubbed me the wrong way. Im really glad others can be optimistic about it but it made me disgusted to think that people lap this shit up and think its great content worthy of their attention worthy of money. I would also like to say that the Game Grumps may have resorted to immature humour in the past and fart jokes and dick jokes but never to this extent. Jon and Arin would talk during their episodes to each other. They would disagree and discuss game play game development game feel music ambitions and they would also balance serious discussion with infantile humour. The contrast worked well. It was straight mangoof ball. All Dan does is stroke Arins dick and tell him what an amazing voice actor he is when I would argue he is average at best. All Arin does is make pissed off comments about things and insist hes right. There is no good comedic rapport between the two because they dont try and when they do try theyre trying too hard. They may be good friends but they dont have entertaining chemistry. Theyre just children. I seriously hate the content they release. It makes me so bemused that people are excited to have this lowquality shit shoveled down their throats.,rantgrumps,daxtwxi,2,t5_38iu4

If this was on the main sub I would see why you think what Im doing is wrong but you know I came to sub reddit to vent right? It is literally made for that exact purpose Also gt You obviously hate the content as I can see by the fact that in one day you posted two rants to this page and by taking a quick look at your other posts all you do is complain about grumps.Not everything I post about Game Grumps is not my entire thoughts on Game Grumps. I mean I like plenty of things the Game Grumps do I just find sharing what irks me here and there to here is some way fun and a way to emote you know feel. gtwhy dont you unsubscribe I like alot of things the grumps do. Im not leaving them because they made someone in Pokemon Sun sound annoying.gt  and forget about it so you dont get so butthurtLook if anyone here is butthurt Id say its you for taking my handful of opinions and pretend there everything I feel about them. Besides if you dont like seeing people such as my self constantly rant on Game Grumps on again A SITE CALLED RANT GRUMPS then maybe you should not be here. Besides if I didnt really hated game grumps why would I keep watching and give some honest thoughts to them? Ranting is a healthy way to keep you feeling and care about something. Its easy as hell to say you love something but saying things you hate comes from the heart and clashes with you. Whats not healthy is thinking people who rant are angry little butthurt people that obviously hate the content that have no right to not unsubscribe and forget about it.

Like you said you never really have to read what anyones saying to know what you have to do. So hes choosing to highlight it in his show as a flaw when the fault lies with him for not understanding it.Also outside of the lore reasons Arin is still just plain bad at the game which is not good for the show. Hes not even bad in an entertaining way. Its like watching someone hammer in a nail with a screwdriver.

They shit on guys like Markiplier and Pewdiepie because they have never met them and just assume the worst of them and that any fans of theirs must be complete retards and absolutely whats wrong with todays generation. Some even think Mark would be working at McDonalds or WalMart if lets playing wasnt popular because they believe he is utterly talentless.It is insanely hypocritical and complete bullshit and one of the main reasons I tend to be put off from them at times. Arin and Dan are the exact same type of lets players they make fun of. Suzy is the exact kind of Tumblrina special snowflake they constantly shit on. But of course theyd never say anything like to them and they tip toe around and make sure not to include them whenever they rail on those type of people.

Its only natural for someone to defend themself from what they view as false criticism and when all criticism is false to you you have to find a way to cope.
