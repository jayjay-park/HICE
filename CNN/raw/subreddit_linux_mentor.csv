Modern Ssh bruteforce botnets have tons of IPs to try from so if they get locked out on one IP then try just continue where they left off.Also use something like logwatch to monitor your SSH and failban logs.,linux_mentor,d2e1ebd,1,t5_36z85

Its perfectly capable of running a WordPress site with some light to medium traffic when you leverage CloudFront and ElastiCache. It will be a good learning opportunity in its own right.,linux_mentor,d57fdj0,1,t5_36z85

If you want to try an alternative to Dropbox you could give OwnCloud a try. You can host the service locally or subscribe to it externally like Dropbox.,linux_mentor,ddhex9s,1,t5_36z85
