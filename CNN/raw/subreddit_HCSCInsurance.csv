6690229,0,t3_3l0wtk,How much does your rate go up with Auto Insurance when you hit someone? I had  incidents this year.?I filed a small claim in April  for total damages about . There was no damage to my car but I hit my babysitters car who was doubleparked in front of my townhouse. Now I just hit someone else and the estimate is about  for his bumper. I am wondering if it is worth it to go through my insurance and have another claim against me or if I should just handle it out of packet? My insurance fro the year now is very good only . But for some reason this is a bad year for me. I have  kids  with autism that is always driving me crazy while I drive . I dont want to hurt myself by going through insurance. Thanks,HCSCInsurance,d0bbtxq,1,t5_30eyk
