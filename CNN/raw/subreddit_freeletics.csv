423980,0,t3_1yxhsx,I already had pain in my left wrist while doing burpees in the beginning. Now I think my technique has improved and I no longer feel this pain. Are you doing the movement correctly ? Try to see more videos of people doing burpees it might help you to see where you are failing if you are failing. If you see that there is no problem with your technique then I recommend you to visit a physician. A little bit of pain in the chest is normal but not to the point of impacting your breathing. At least that is what I think.,freeletics,cfopl4h,1,t5_2xrcb
452406,0,t1_cfrlwi7,Thanks for your reply. If there is no law in how many workoutssessions I do during the week could I try to do more than one session in a day if I feel good for that ? I have a training of  sessions and I really think that I could do it in three days and I have done hell days already so I saw that it is possible to do at least three workouts in a day,freeletics,cfror25,1,t5_2xrcb
911628,0,t1_ch6tglz,Great job and really nice transformation  Especially the side view really shows how much leaner youve become. You did gain some muscle mass though not a lot but thats only expected when you went with a large calorie deficit. Next is eating and lifting Keep going and good luck!,freeletics,ch7wp7w,1,t5_2xrcb

1002352,0,t1_chi7u2c,Yeah. If you bought the coach dont worry about keeping the pace of the  weeks for now. Theyll give you  more weeks in case you cant complete all the sessions from a week for whatever reason that is. ,freeletics,chi84l7,1,t5_2xrcb
1009595,0,t3_25nro6,You can also kip the pullups which helps. Watch the video closely. It mentions kipping. You only have to do strict pullups if the workout calls for it.,freeletics,chj1r9s,1,t5_2xrcb

1822950,0,t3_2fg1q1,The idea of the workouts is to finish them no matter how long they take. When you start out youre going to need a ton of breaks and itll probably take a long time but for best results you should really try and get through it.If you really dont think you have enough fitness to get through a complete workout like Aphrodite you could stick with what youve been doing for a week or two. Just choose one or two standalone exercises to do each time you workout and choose a number of reps thats challenging for you. After doing that for a little bit the full workouts should be much easier.There are  versions of each workout endurance standard and strength but the number of reps for each version never changes. Freeletics is all about improving your times to show progress instead of increasing your reps.,freeletics,ck8us40,2,t5_2xrcb
1839201,0,t1_ckatdot,Nope not the modified versions. Yeah Ill start with the modified versions after I give star one more shot tom. Or am i pushing it? I was hoping to complete in Star no matter how long it takes.,freeletics,ckatjal,1,t5_2xrcb

2809569,0,t3_2s9g92,Sore muscles means you did something good haha Gz on your first step! If you are thinking something like fck this is hard. Well yeah it is but you will manage. The body adjust quickly and gets stronger fast. Never give up. You did it in  min now but in a month or  you cut it in half perhaps. Pullups are great but difficult to do. I am not the expert and can only tell from my own experience. Try to do as many as you can. When i started doing pullups i only could do  strict pullups. Now i  in a row.About sore muscles. Doing a workout is good for the muscles but if it is too much just rest.,freeletics,cnnftsq,1,t5_2xrcb

3816810,0,t3_3451rt,Im not a nutritionist but  protein shakes sound quite lot to me. Supplements are supposed to supplement your nutrition not be the basis of. Protein shakes are convinient but your normal diet should consist enough protein and nutrients that you really dont need the supplements.To me  kg of muscle in  weeks is quite lot  if it really is muscle and that suggests that you are eating enough as you wouldnt be growing that amount of muscle on negative calorie count. That would amount to  kilos in a year! Even if only half of your weight gain is muscle its still a very good progress. Is there any reason you feel you should be eating more protein shakes? I believe not even advanced bodybuilders typically consume more protein shakes in a day  or even that many.,freeletics,cqrchv4,2,t5_2xrcb
4583091,0,t1_ct853kf,yes me to thats why I asked I was wondering how ppl do it but I guess some begin with more fit bodies than us lol.  I did the training thing and then a warm up after training lol to do the first official work out and omg... my body gave out. As I get stronger I guess this will start to become uncommon and hopefully Ill be like the other people here that go on and on with lesser breaks. I hope we get better at this sooner. Still sore as Im typing lol,freeletics,ct8atti,2,t5_2xrcb

8232911,0,t3_4s1tm3,Set goals and track your progress and make sure your reminded of your goals on a constant basis. The premise is you have to do what youll say youll do. The more you do those things the more gratification youll have and thats how you implement a new habit. There are lots of good apps for Android and IOS to do this with. They show up in your notifications and you have to look at them all the time until you check them off. For android Id recommend Habit Streaks and For IOS Today Habit Streaks. Set your end goal e.g. Lose  kg run  k do  pullups etc. then think about what youd need to do consistently to reach your goal e.g. Train  minutes a day run  k etc. Do this and motivation wont be some feeling it will be a set of predetermined and measurable actions you take.
