6011576,0,t3_3xrcgy,Have you scanned your computer for malware keyloggers viruses etc? That would be the most likely cause. Electrum is just the wallet. It doesntisnt designed to modify or lose transactions. If that were the case nobody would be using it. There are various scanners on the net that you can use to see if your computer has been hacked. Try downloading onesome of them and check your system.,Electrum,cy7nayh,1,t5_2vm0v
