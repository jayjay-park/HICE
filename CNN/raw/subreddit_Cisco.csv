119423,0,t3_1v7c7t,The router performance matrix sheet is the drag race specs.  These do not simulate real world scenarios and are poor to use for router selection absent some compensation.  If you are running a router with zero services QoS IPS dynamic routing IPSLA ZBFW shapingpolicing policies EEM net flow etc you can theoretically reach those numbers.  In practice nobody has this setup.  You do need things like NAT or QoS on your devices.The packets per second count also needs to be looked at and considered as well.  The perf matrix is always using  byte packets.  You would want to consider that most of your packets are going to be  bytes if it is an internet router....or smaller if its a voip router.  This document talks to thisEssentially the answer is you need to know a little about your flows and get a feel for it.  I used to always run cable modems behind a lowend  DSL behind the high end  series Ts only on s and Ts on s  Mb on ASR k OC on  POS.  All of these absent voip capabilities.

532979,0,t3_207wvg,This is not entirely accurate.  does in fact use  and  but according to .af the switch MAY put power on either the data pairs or the unused pairs or just simply prefer the data pairs for power as well.  Some switches are smart enough to try one set and then the other.  One of the side effects of this is that in older networks or where running new cables isnt available you can use  and  for one PoE device and  and  for another PoE device on the same wire in the wall and just terminate the run into two jacks at each end.  Which is handy in old buildings with block walls and the like.Also a different but related problem arises when using nongig aware PoE injectors on gigcapable endpoints.  Enough information is exchanged on  and  to get the link to come up in gig but gige uses all  pairs for data.  In this case youll not only get power but even link and it still wont work unless you force one end into M.Source Senior engineer for ITSP. ,Cisco,cg0uujh,3,t5_2qizx

1305911,0,t3_2903cj,I was once working for a banking customer.... They happened to be decommissioning few of their catalyst switches.... The customers network was purely textbook Cisco architecture.... And I wasnt too learned on all the functionalities of a catalyst switch and had to Google quite frequently to look up commands and their effects... So their project head asked me to decommission one of their redundant catalyst switch.... For which I logged in through a telnet session from the primary switch.... With Google to help I managed to restore the switch to factory settings and reloaded the switch.... But since I wasnt too sure about catalyst switches I went on to check the vlan database.... It seemed pretty intact... I deleted it again and was about to hit reload... Fucking hell!!! I just noticed that the st reload has disconnected me from the redundant switch and brought me back to the primary switch.... I had just deleted the vlan configuration on the primary switch!!!! An entire country network had got isolated!!! I had screwed up thanks to their very similar hostnames which had their distinguishing character placed in the middle!!! Thanks design team!!!

Note that the IP Base image entitles the user to configure OSPF for Routed Access however the restrictions on the number of routes and instances are not enforced in this release. The IP Services image is required if one needs multiple OSPFv and OSPFv instances without route restrictions. Additionally the IP Services image is required to enable the multiVRFCE feature.

7338117,0,t1_d2c63fv,That certainly does appear to be assigning addresses from a local address pool though one thing that occurs to me is that if youre doing RADIUS user authentication then I think its possible that the RADIUS server could be assigning the client an address and overriding the local pool assignment.  In general anything you configure in RADIUS such as maximum session time for example will override the corresponding setting youve configured in the ASA so thats something to be careful of if you have a fancy RADIUS setup.  If youre not doing any RADIUS authentication then it would appear to be a bug but you could probably get a bit more information about whats going on with some appropriate debugging.  Im still bothered by the DNS aspect of this behavior since I know the ASA cant do DNS updates based on the local address pool assignment.  So either its happening at the time of the address assignment by some other device or the client PC itself is registering a DNS update with your internal servers after the VPN connects and the PC logs into your Windows network Im not much of a Windows guy so some of that is speculation on my part.I hope this helps.,Cisco,d2cakuz,1,t5_2qizx

Disable autoupdate in your current client profile.. Create an additional profile with autoupdate enabled.. Assign this new profile to a new group policy.. Assign the new group policy to specific users based on AD attributes which could be done several different ways.Though this would still have brand new users receiving the . image.

10306084,0,t3_5neknn,Hi allSo after a fair bit of debugging today Im still no further to diagnosing the actual issue but think I know what the issue is...Packet tracer shows the traffic allowed and matching a vpn tunnel. We also have another local subnet that uses the vpn tunnel and I can see traffic flowing to and from the peer. Packet tracer also allows traffic from this secondary vlan to the remote subnet.    We are seeing echo requests from the peer to the ftp server but no replies. I did a packet capture on the inside interface sourcing the client IP to destination any any. I observed dns traffic and some traffic to an outside IP address so that would suggest layer  connectivity.    The only thing I can think of is that the server has reenabled windows firewall or such? Lost power and restarted? Outbound requests from the client would work because it would be stateful. Requests made to the server from the remote clientare probably just getting dropped!   Seems unlikely its a default gateway issue because I observed that bit of tcp traffic to an outside IP address.    Would you agree?,Cisco,dcc908j,1,t5_2qizx
