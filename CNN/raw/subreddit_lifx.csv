4069016,0,t1_crg39sl,Yes it might and there is no warranty if it does. We do test things before we beta release them but we cant guarantee they wont do something nasty. So far there have not been any incidents that we are aware of.,lifx,crk3grv,1,t5_2x1dq
4240135,0,t1_cs3c06c,Does mean we might get an update to LIFXtend in the future when you have time? I have missed it so much.,lifx,cs3kfjx,2,t5_2x1dq

5474262,0,t3_3q24uc,Well I dont know that there is a IFTTT trigger for your first point but the trigger that DOES work is within a certain area. So like when you are approaching your home the lights will turn on. That works rather well. For instance my trigger is when my automatic OBD device detects my car has started it turns my lights off. It works pretty quickly but I havent timed it. I just know my lights turn off before Im at the bottom of my hill.When using these features IFTTT integration it should use littleno battery. Hope that answers your questions. Let me know if you have any others.,lifx,cwbdzkv,1,t5_2x1dq
5728143,0,t1_cwgah5p,Thanks so much for the guide! I followed it to the letter and everything was going fine until I decided to test if the lights would turn off  on as you suggested in part m. It keeps bring back error  Invalid token. Ive tried creating multiple tokens tried copying and pasting from email as you suggested and tried typing the tokens in by hand. Ive also searched through LIFX Developer Zone site to try and find a solution but I cant seem to find one. Do you have any ideas on how to fix my problem?,lifx,cx74rfj,1,t5_2x1dq

7042301,0,t1_d04f3ih,I also dabble in iOS development. If you start making this I would like to put my time in to it as well. You can have the rights and money. I just want to see a usable Apple watch app for Lifx. The official one is a joke.,lifx,d1elojr,1,t5_2x1dq

8010031,0,t3_4jh7k7,Mine stopped working a month or two ago too. I understand that Google is launching a bunch of new smart home products so they are messing around with Google Now to have consistent commands with their new products and all that they support.

8097743,0,t1_d4poio0,PERSONAL RESPONSEPersonally I dont care about controlling my lights with my voice I think its neat but not something that is going to change the way I interact with my lights. Even in our office we usually just use one of the ipads or multiple phones we all have. We have an echo google now and cortana.To each their own though  Were still a long way off from the type of connected home where voice will be natural I dont use siri to search for things I only use her to read my texts while Im driving and to send someone a text while driving.Interesting recent article about it Part of me also has a problem with devices that are always listening from a legal perspective. Technology is advancing at a rate that is far outpacing existing privacy laws and everything is cloud based these days which means something is getting stored somewhere.,lifx,d4q9c9t,2,t5_2x1dq

8558952,0,t3_4wd8uj,Ahhh okay do you think it will be able to cycle all of the colors in a release soon? Im trying to decide on returning the bulbs and purchasing the Philips hue or staying with lifx. ,lifx,d6bg200,1,t5_2x1dq
9027464,0,t1_d7woedw,What makes you say that? Is it because the time its taking them to release? i. e. Building a completely new bulbproduct would take longer than a bridge for existing bulbs?,lifx,d7wyjoa,1,t5_2x1dq
9161324,0,t3_55rv97,IFAIK you can either match the old routers settings SSID shared key etc or hard reset and setup all the bulbs on the new wifi network.,lifx,d8d9k3b,3,t5_2x1dq

9365901,0,t3_575cib,They claim that they work with Google Now and was the main reason I got it. So that it would work with my Google Home when it comes in. Its been broken with no signs of an update. Considering returning them.,lifx,d937187,1,t5_2x1dq

9938894,0,t1_db17kd4,I want to thank you SO MUCH for this post.I live in a Hue house and was thinking about getting a LIFX Z strip because Hue is having problems fulfilling their Lighstrip Plus orders.Looks like I will just wait patiently instead of rushing to get some equipment with reliability issues.  Ive had zero reliability issues with Hue....my wife would kill me.,lifx,db32a57,1,t5_2x1dq

10019078,0,t3_5ibdfk,Been trying to connect one of mine that seemingly shows as disconnected in the app reset it which i knew was a bad idea because of the software onboarding and now I cant reconnect it to the wifi tried with the Android app and the barely working windows app. All my three Color  keep disconnecting and connecting in the app. This company is definitely not getting any more of my money. Wifi router is RTAC,lifx,dbdiit5,2,t5_2x1dq
10222373,0,t3_5m95k4,On Android you have to disable your data when the WiFi has no internet it detects if theres no internet and figures you dont want to be on it,lifx,dc2rh6v,1,t5_2x1dq
10269151,0,t3_5mli45,Its just an LED strip right? They are so cheap if you just buy one with the remote,lifx,dc82bz1,1,t5_2x1dq
10325116,0,t3_5ntqjl,I do really like the scene options they have  and the animations that are included in many of them are great. I love passing clouds the Van Gogh scenes and the home theater settings.Interesting note however as I addressed in another post any of the animated scenes from OnSwitch automatically override any attempt at controlling the bulbs until the OnSwitch scene is turned off. For instance I had passing clouds on and when leaving the house I used an ifttt command to turn the lights off which the lights did turn off for a couple seconds but then turned back on with the passing clouds setting still active. I had to find the device that I used to set the passing clouds scene and turn it off from there before the lights would turn off and stay off. Quite an added hassle when flying out the door.And this isnt specific to the OnSwitch app most effects from the Lifx app cause the same issues.,lifx,dceeqks,3,t5_2x1dq
10385818,0,t1_dcl9q0y,Thanks for the feedback russjr was it easy to add the lights to the rooms you created in the app? ,lifx,dclap7q,1,t5_2x1dq
10505707,0,t1_dcyhpgv,Um you can already do this just twist your line and load wires together to have your light on   then have another wire coming from those that go to the line port on a z wave switch now you can toggle the switch and send z wave signals but power the light all the time ,lifx,dcyxm3h,1,t5_2x1dq
10571197,0,t3_5rc0o2,Are you able to check on your router to see if theyre even connected? Ive had them be connected and not show in the app restarting the router and cycling the bulbon off helps. I have one bulb an original first gen that I have to reset and reconnect to WiFi about every  months but the  newer ones I have work almost perfectly aside from the occasional hiccup,lifx,dd6c3uu,2,t5_2x1dq
10682656,0,t3_5sofyz,Best Buy has them available. Also the LIFX model seems to be easier to come across and its on sale at the same price as the non  model. As far as I can tell the only difference between the LIFX and the regular Gen   the one you linked to is the LIFX has infrared in addition to all of the features of the regular Gen  so if you can get the LIFX while its on sale you wont be missing anything that youd get with the Gen  multicolor bulb. ,lifx,ddhu2qu,2,t5_2x1dq
11316001,0,t1_dfej8sz,As far as I know only the Gen  comes in that packaging.  Sounds like something iffy has happened.You should take it back as you didnt get what you paid for Gen  is brighter has newerbetter chipset,lifx,dfenfbu,2,t5_2x1dq
11605055,0,t1_dgbf2cv,Yeah. I dont have any issues. The home control menu is just somewhere different. My lights work just fine with GA. ,lifx,dgbfxzy,1,t5_2x1dq
