1782998,0,t3_2ewtnl,There seems to be a few more across Russia.  For some reason Google Maps is a little inconsistent with their coloration.  Usually the green denotes parks or preserved areas but in Russia it appears to just be any forested uninhabited area.  The level of scrutiny placed on accurate coloration of these regions was probably pretty low considering it doesnt really mean anything here.  So apathy due to arbitrariness.,GoogleMaps,ck3wfxr,0,t5_2qqv1

And of course theres an automatic redirect to national versions of Google that you cant opt out of unless you remain signed into a Google account andor let them keep cookies permanently.I cant think of a single reason why I or anyone else would EVER want to use google.ca over google.com.EDIT Or ever use Maps again for that matter  every single move or zoom or search on the map puts a new entry in your browser history which overloads things FAST,GoogleMaps,cru9o1v,4,t5_2qqv1

5094072,0,t3_3kqxxg,Are you referring to the section of that branch that appears to be obscured by the cloud? If so then I think its a weird artifact of digital photography. The tip of the branch that appears to stick out from the cloud is the same as the branch beside it. I believe the branch probably moved due to wind as the photo was taken.  ,GoogleMaps,cv00yqv,1,t5_2qqv1

I ask only because I read on another google maps thread that google is apparently contractually prohibited from caching streetviewmaps data for Japan so everything would have to be coming from the source servers and perhaps you have some connectivity problems to them ?Also it works for me No unloaded sections ,GoogleMaps,da7xkpi,3,t5_2qqv1

10816050,0,t3_5uo8wt,Ive only used the Android version but assuming theyre mostly the same heres what Id like to seeOptionpreference to ALWAYS avoid tolls  Probably the most requested feature in Maps.Navigation mode for public transit  Right now you can only view the routes youll be taking. It doesnt actually guide you. For example if you get on a bus it should tell you how long you have until your stop and notify you when youre getting close. Moovit does this amazingly well.Mixed transportation modes  All the buses in my city are equipped with bike racks. It would be neat if I could specify a busbike combo trip that optimizes the route based on both the available bus routes and bike pathslanes.Timeline should give you more stats  If I select a place it should tell me when I was last there the total number of times Ive been there this monthyearever etc. You should be able to see totals for miles walked driven biked etc. for each day week month etc.Custom waypoints  When you search for directions on the desktop version of Maps you can drag points along the route to force it to take different streets. Comes in handy when you know about some construction work that Google doesnt for example. The mobile version should incorporate these somehow. A great feature to have but it would also lay the groundwork for...Preferred routes  Lets say youve utilized the aforementioned waypoints to create your preferred route from Home to Work. Somewhere there should be a buttoncheckbox to Make this a preferred route so that any time you tell it to navigate from Home to Work it will give you that preferred route as the first option even if its a bit slower than what Google comes up with. Maybe have a threshold where it will only supersede your preferred route it if it detects absurdly slower traffic than usual or some kind of accident along the way.,GoogleMaps,ddvll32,3,t5_2qqv1
