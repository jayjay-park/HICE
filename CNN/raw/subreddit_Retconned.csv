8977764,0,t3_53097e,THe idea that the moon would look visibly larger sometimes vs others is something I never heard until maybe  months ago.  However on the reverse I was thinking the last few days the moon looks really puny now.  I think what this ME thing has done is made me question a lot of things.  In the past if I had thought the moon looked small I would have immediately then thought Nah that IMPOSSIBLE! and that would have been the end of that train of thought.  But now its like just about anything could happen perhaps but hard to tell which things are just something I didnt notice before vs which might actually be different from before.  The ME seems to like to change things in a slow and sneaky way making it harder.  LIke Australia did not apparently suddenly show up under Papua New Guinea but instead had been sneaking over that way for a while now.  I suspect it happens that way with history as well things change bit by bit a bit of new story is added here dates are pushed back there.  The new story will be similar enough that most will mistake it for a slight misremembering.  ,Retconned,d7qzoge,3,t5_3fft0

I usually will show historical reasoning  behind the word usage instead. Example  being words are older than people think and usually fall right  into the time frame the KJV was written.Map projections has never been one I used because  then my map from more  than  years ago would  still look different.In short I dont  like giving  the usual reasons.

9172414,0,t1_d8enqvn,The thing is you cannot compare a bicycle to a motorcycle. What is happening in your video is for a specific reason. It has a constant speed that entire time it isnt slowing down. If it was slowing down that wouldnt be happening it would just fall over like you said.  wheel things still tip over easy if you dont have good balance and especially at slow speeds. All  wheel things operate much better at higher speeds. Nothing has changed on that front what so ever. A racing bike has its transmission set so that its idle will rev high and give it a good amount of speed allowing what you are seeing to happen. The reason it is looping side to side like that is the weight shift is causing the wheel to turn and it is like a pendulum.It is trying to fall over in that video but it is a sweet spot of the forward motion and the arc of the turn autocorrecting the bike. It isnt something that is going to happen every single time no matter what the  wheel vehicle is. I am sorry but you are just wrong on this one. You are just not understanding what is happening. I say this with respect and I hope that you recognize that Mandela Effect cannot just be a catch all answer for everything you dont understand. This is just a case of you lacking a particular knowledge. I understand and expect you to fully disagree with me and that is cool. I cant just say yeah you must be right in this instance just to placate you though. I am afraid you are getting tunnel vision. This is totally unrelated to any other other reported ME it doesnt automatically get credit because I believe other reports are happening. Frankly Loony the only ME that I have ever reported is the B Bears. I have not personally witnessed any others. I cant verify any continents have moved nor any logos have changed nor any physical changes so I dont ever. I am not saying those things havent happened but I cant attest to them. The reason I dont call people idiots for those things is because I give them the benefit of the doubt that they are logical and rational people until the show otherwise. I trust that they are as certain about their claims as I am mine but I know that isnt always the case. This however is not logical or rational Loony.

10258936,0,t1_dc6ofmi,Very interesting and thoughtprovoking ideas which should in my opinion be taken into serious consideration for further analysis and discussion. Thank you!Something I thought about for a long time is to build a puzzle of the surrounding circumstances around a specific effect.Looking at Australias movement. It has no longer an unique fauna and flora as before shouldnt this also affect for example Papua New Guinea?!My idea is to build a puzzle with what have changed in relation to the obvious effect in this caseI dont remember Torres Strait between Australia and Papua New Guinea ever existing. Neither am I familiar with Lus Vaz de Torres who apparently is an th and thcentury maritime explorer of unknown origin and also the one noted for the first recorded European navigation of the strait. I thought I knew them all from Marco Polo Vasco Da Gama Magellan Columbus Drake to James Cook etc etc.Further when it comes to fauna and flora there are many things I never heard of in those areas like  Red fruit aka Buah Merah from Papua Indoneisa. Which apparently is a significant herbal breakthrough for Cancer! Tubenosed fruit bat from Papua New Guinea aka Yoda bat! The bats back story is as mysterious as Yodas. The animal had been seen before the  expeditions but scientists know little about it! Large Flying Fox which can attain a wingspan of over six feet . m! That doesnt mean they didnt exist before maybe I never heard of them. Therefore I focus on the ones which is more unlikely to miss... like an .m wingspan bat!Then you fill up the puzzle piece by piece with other areas like history politics economy etc etc.It will take time to build a puzzle like this for every specific effect I have encountered. But honestly I think it is worth it for the peace of mind. Some effects might be strengthen by correlating evidence while others might even be put to rest who knows!,Retconned,dc6wnm1,2,t5_3fft0

Essentially he and Wisemans group take different approaches to the same general idea.They give very nice analyses of particular phenomena like groundstate energy and quantum tunnelling  I discuss probability and symmetry in more depth Sebens says. I think that together they do a nice job presenting this exciting new idea. Sebens has written an article describing his approach which will be published in the journal Philosophy of Science.Quantum Mechanics as Classical PhysicsPhilosophy of Science  April  pp. QuoteHere I explore a novel nocollapse interpretation of quantum mechanics which combines aspects of two familiar and welldeveloped alternatives Bohmian mechanics and the manyworlds interpretation. Despite reproducing the empirical predictions of quantum mechanics the theory looks surprisingly classical. All there is at the fundamental level are particles interacting via Newtonian forces.

People have always had been able to seek and find Enlightenment before I would recommend Christ personally or were lucky enough to have their hearts stay true and never become a victim of the illusion but I think the ME is just one facet of the Apocalypse that we are in right now  which simply means the unveiling and is not meant in the scary way most people think of that word.Other things are waking people up to The Babylonian money Spell and the Magik that Hollywood and the Media has been using to blind and program us for so long. That stuff about Jimmy Savile and the Royal Elite and the whole PizzaGate WikiLeaks revelations should have people aware that we really are dealing with rulers who employ some dark energies to give them power  and its Always been that way!  Whether it was Nimrod building the Tower Hitler and the SS looking for ancient relics and channeling the power of the Black Sun and other occult knowledge or our modern day Social Engineering  its always been about usurping the creative power and life energy of the individual for the gain of a few and is done by blinding the masses to their true potential. I think its funny to watch the death throws of the mainstream media news outlets as they cry out Its fake news fault! trust us again!...please pretty please... when they were the ones who got totally busted lying and making things up.

My IQ has been evaluated at ish selfreporting I know but thats what Ive been told.I was placed in the program because I was able to solve math problems very fast in my head and my teacher couldnt believe how quickly I would turn in my math tests without using a calculator and all the responses would be correct.Things I remember about the programThere were no windows.I was pulled out of regular class time for a full hour.I was upset that I was missing what the other kids were learning about just to sit in a room and talk about weird ink blot tests.I asked the teacher when we would be doing complex math problems I assumed thats why I was placed in this program. She told me that they had already covered the math unit and I would have to wait until the next year to do math problems in G and T.We did a lot of analogies  like tree is to branch as hand is to . At the end of the year every student was REALLY excited that we would have the opportunity to touch a real rabbits brain.I was FREAKED OUT by having to a rabbits brain I was a little girl! and BEGGED my mother to take me out of the program. I was told that not touching the brain was not an option.Eventually she did. It took a lot of convincing though.Edit Also I have had a NDE with almost drowning. A family member assumed that I knew how to swim and pushed me into the deep end of a pool. I almost died. A different family member saved me.I dont believe I am being tracked by anyone at least I am unaware of this.The soulmate thing vaguely applies. I have taken LSD and Mushrooms multiple times. I was born early. There are chunks of my childhood memories missing. Particularly what the hell we did in G and T.

It was almost exactly like that. Whoa! There is memories hidden in my mind despite having thought about this many many times before. So weird. M.E. is a trip and a half. I am more convinced than ever she had braces. I pulled up a newold memory about this exact thing!!!!!!,Retconned,dfhnhm8,2,t5_3fft0

11508894,0,t1_dfv0ozv,it could avoid a straight path if the muscle had a twist in it where the zygomatic arch used to be. i know nothing about muscles or if this is possible but from an engineering perspective it would be possible. maybe the muscle was even fused at the place the zygomatic arch was. seems like over engineering to need to have a bone hole to slide the muscle through. do any other muscles in the body require the same thing? peace,Retconned,dg0j9c8,1,t5_3fft0

11640585,0,t3_660o6u,Well put mate. The more I research into other phenomena many of which I also personally discounted previously as too out there or strange the more I am also seeing that they are all connected. Your metaphors of the roots and the puzzle within a wider puzzle are good ones. I believe all of this also connects with ancient civilisations and the advanced technology they used to create the megaliths and pyramids. I also think it connects with many other things including the reasons we are currently being driven headlong into WW but I am not sure how the dots are connected yet.

11806195,0,t3_68gc1n,Just thinking outloud...Flip flops dont necessarily mean we went back. Only that reality shifted again. If wed gone back then wouldnt everything have changed back too? So if multiverse is correct you moved from BerenstainTidy Cats to Berenstain Tidy Cat. Thats just . Add them all up and its damn near infinite.Right? Like that problem how many different combinations of numbers are there? There is   ...  ...Change those numbers to different Mandela Effects and its also a lot of combinations. BerenstainMcIntyre Berenstain McEntire BerenstainMcEntyre...What if... the ME was created by a positive entity to wake us up to the fact that our simulated construct was hijacked by a negative entity thereby keeping us enslaved when we could be using our hidden powers to access the multiverse and create our own beautiful reality.Awakening  Simulation  Multiverse,Retconned,dgy9u4v,11,t5_3fft0
