2087805,0,t3_2dzlhh,Before I moved to Fountain Pens I loved   Uniball Jetstreams. A little harder to find in stores but the . models are fantastic. Smooth nice line thats not too wide and flows really well. I actually still really like their red color ink and need to look into a similar hue in the fountain pen world. But they are really fantastic pens and in my opinion leave Pilot Precise V pens and Gs in the dust. ,stationery,cl57fkz,2,t5_2romm
