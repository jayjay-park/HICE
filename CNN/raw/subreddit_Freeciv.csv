4266503,0,t1_cs5khd4,Im about to have a baby in a month so this project has taken a backseat unfortunately. Its hard to say I didnt like the... Eurocentricity of the current freeciv ones so I was going to make Native American European and Asian unit sprites. So far Im done with only the native ones. I finished the city tiles except the modern ones which are pretty decent looking anyway but then I decided I didnt like a few of the cities I made so I plan on going back to fix these. Land tiles are finished but the ocean tiles are taking a lot longer than initially expected.        I would say if I worked on it I could do it in a month. But... Life. Distractions. Hopefully soon. ,Freeciv,cs6jx4n,1,t5_309p1
