2877869,0,t3_2s6eve,Another Sunday brunch recommendation is Whispering Orchards Its in Cleveland so opposite direction if you were planning to head back south but I think its worth the detour. All of the food is farm fresh and being that it is an orchardfarm it would be a lot of fun for your kid as well. Its not an upscale brunch but its not boring diner fare either. Theyre open  am pm in March. ,sheboygan,cnv7res,2,t5_2t96z
