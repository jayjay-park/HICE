342046,0,t1_cfg5l80,Haha I know that.Plenty of people have advised that ObjC isnt beginner oriented and that one should gather object oriented programming experience from language like JavaC before learning ObjC. Im pretty good in Python and I understand very basic Java but I havent been introduced to Object oriented programming. Do you think otherwise?,simpleios,cfg80yu,1,t5_2swkx

3873282,0,t3_34s4e7,It depends on many factors Are you using a lot of UIViewUIControl subclasses rather than standard UIKit controls? Do you often addremove views during animations? Do you want to use Auto Layout?Other than writing demosample code apps the only time I use Interface Builder in iOS is for the Launch Screen file on newer devices.  A lot of this is due to the types of apps Im building  I do a lot of work with custom animations custom controls complex view hierarchies that change during animations etc.  Ive never encountered a situation in my iOS apps where Interface Builder makes my life easier.  However I also know UIKit pretty intimately and Im not sure I would recommend the programmatic approach to you.Its really going to be in your best interest to learn the basics of Interface Builder and learn how actionsoutlets work.  Even if you chose to keep doing things programmatically you wont feel lost when you encounter a xib or storyboard in a sample project.Note If you want to use Auto Layout definitely use Interface Builder.,simpleios,cqxscmk,1,t5_2swkx
