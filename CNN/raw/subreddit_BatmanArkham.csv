They may choose to weave it all into one story a la the animated Under The Red Hood movie. Granted weve seen nothing at all to indicate this is the case. Having said that examining the character model in the screenshots does reveal some similarities between Arkham Knight and Jason Todds Red Hood costume.  And then theres his use of pistols Jasons current weapon of choice. Theres one particular shot of Arkham Knight firing one of his handguns while in midair that makes it seem like it would almost be a waste if it wasnt Jason Todd.

Weve seen characters mention Metropolis a direct reference to Zatanna and an oblique reference to Black Canary in the past so there is some chance of something similar.

Poison Ivy Bane and Joker being the traditional boss fights Scarecrow and Croc being more stealth sections Harley Quinn being more waves of bad guys. Out of all of these Scarecrow is the only one people really talk about because its unique Jokers is considered a weak point Bane and Croc were more annoying than fun and Ivy was a difficult and frustrating. Now go to City.City had Grundy Freeze Rhas and Clayface each of them was unique in their own way a notable improvement over Asylum with Freeze being lauded as a prime example of a perfect boss battle.I can see how he hated the battles of Asylum but Citys battles were a lot more fun and better made overall. ,BatmanArkham,csfnici,1,t5_2y9q4

The fans can get over it. We got tankmobile and retcon Jason and what is that against Nightwing being able to glide....it doesnt even register. Regardless like I said the true failure of this game was not the overuse of the battank or the dismissal of dual play but the lack of a true challenge mode. Like I said free roam is pointless since post main story the cities are mostly empty with no large fights or predator opportunities. We should have been given the same style of challenge mode AC had only with four categories rather than two dual mode or not. As it stands did you even feel comfortable with the dual play predator map or did you spend that time getting used to it only to find it was literally the only time it would ever be used. Did you find in combat swapping characters a little disorienting and would have liked to get better...tough. Now they are going to throw a character specific AR mission at us for Robin and Nightwing and wipe their hands of it. I say fuck that.

4868335,0,t3_3hg8ka,How I see itThe Gotham City Stories in the case of September  Nightwings DLC story will probably be in the form of Arkham Episodes just like the Harley Quinn and Red Hood DLC.Rocksteady probably had to make the decision to develop a season pass worth a higher price to cover the cost incurred by the long development time of the game and in order to do that they had to produce sufficient content worth the high season pass price.If they offered the challenge maps from the getgo they would have to make complicated DLCs with new features just like the Batgirl DLC in order to attract buyers. Instead by axing challenge maps they can string together a few combat and predator challenge rooms add some dialogue and cutscenes and release it separately for different characters creating the illusion that the season pass is content heavy whilst keeping production costs relatively low.

I know the intention is probably that Batmans the only one who can see it thanks to the cowl but that idea in itself just feels weird if thats the case why not just have it projected on the cowl lens instead of our of your gauntlet? and the whole thing seems uncharacteristically lax.I know Batmans psychologically compromised in Arkham Knight but that doesnt mean Babs Al and the others should all be acting so slow witted when it comes to confidentiality.,BatmanArkham,cu9k47v,6,t5_2y9q4

For example if what you are speculating happens then she would have to die at the end because of the fact that if she remains alive the love between Cat and Bats would be no more. On the other hand they would not have enough time to keep developing her character and affection to Bruce. If she doesnt die they could have some love story there so Damian Wayne will be born and that could help WB Montreal if they dont do an Origins sequel.If it is only Ras MAYBE just maybe she could be mentioned but nothing more...,BatmanArkham,cvqqk4a,1,t5_2y9q4

And of course the TDK suit is on the way too.On the other hand though a lot of things I was hoping for or was looking forward to from the leaks seem to have been cut. Okay so theres no TAS content whatsoever. I can live with that disappointing as it is. But no Jim Lee batsuit? No Damian Robin skin? Black Mask and Prometheus both being cut from Season of Infamy? None of the DLC characters getting alternates? Especially Red Hood and Harley both of whom have at least one perfectly serviceable alternate skin already in the game.Ive actually enjoyed the extra Batmobiles and the racetracks and am looking forward to the s content as well but Im definitely a little disappointed in whats left. I hope the Million Dollar Mayhem thing is one of those  TBA AR Challenges that sounded like a riot.,BatmanArkham,cw1ws0t,4,t5_2y9q4

5418922,0,t3_3p9449,I forgot to put my idea in the first post but heres the gist  No Arkham Knight it would only be Red Hood. Everyone essentially knew Arkham Knight would be Jason so why not just keep his most famous persona? Scarecrow isnt seen for most of the game only heard. No Joker blood changing people or Batman so no Joker constantly showing up. Batman blames himself for Jokers death. The villains all actually work together and the important villains Twoface Penguin Riddler etc. have big roles in the game as Batman and his allies work to get information out of them while simultaneously stopping their illegal activities.  Robin and side missions have him tracking and stopping Black Masks drug production and trade in the recaptured Sionis Steel Mill. Catwomans sidemission branches off from a Harley Quinn mission in Batmans story as Selina is trying to take down Quinn and her Jokerz gang in the amusement park seen in a Matter of Family. Nightwings missions have him infiltrating the refurbished Iceberg Lounge to stop Penguin and TwoFace. No Batmobile battle mode no tanks. The Batmobile is the same as Arkham Asylum and is a totally optional mode of transportation.I have a lot more ideas and actually would love to write it as a story if there are people who would read it.,BatmanArkham,cw4bpms,1,t5_2y9q4

I think they could do a killer Superman origins game. Maybe you have to learn how to control each of his powers like earning new gadgets for batman. Of course the obvious main villain would be Lex but maybe he has a few guys working for him so we get some variety in our boss battles.

6028686,0,t1_cy9vpb6,AK What can I say? It was the chosen one... it was said Knight would blow the other games away  not join the triple A shame crowd. Bring balanced DLC  not leave us with a bad taste of buyers remorse in our mouths. The most depressing part is that  shortly before Knight  there was another game called Shadows of Mordor that actually did a better job than Knight itself of living up to the feeling of the original Arkham games. So where do you start in a situation like this? Well the most obvious problem to start with would be the number of glitches and bugs and stability issues present in the PC version. Of course  to be fair  we shouldnt focus on those issues. Judging a game by ONE bad port is hardly fair. So we will focus on the other issues that plague Arkham Knight  such as the story. First we have the number two to the main villain Arkham Knight and even if you dont know who he is clue yes you do he comes off not so much as a villain  but as a pathetic crybaby. He was tortured  he hates Batman  this fact will be ground into your head within the first hour of the game. The problem with Knight is that with the removal of Joker the motivation he SHOULD have had for coming to Gotham is gone. So an ornate and in some cases crappy plot has to be contrived to explain his presence in Gotham and his willingness to work with Scarecrow. The rest of Batmans villains are okay  some of them even good  but none of them are ever really great. Not even villains like Penguin or TwoFace both of whom made some of the most memorable contributions to AC and in Penguins case AO are ever really anything more than good because you never really FIGHT them. They never SEEM like a threat because youve always got your tank or theres always a cutscene where Batman solves the problem for you. Lets try and be honest here  when the majority of the best story moments happen when Batman is talking to Alfred his pet teenagers or his new imaginary friend SOMETHING is wrong. In fact some of the only real classic boss battles in the whole of the game can be experienced ONLY if youre willing to shell out some cash. And there we come to the next problem. The DLC for this game. Ignoring the fact that challenge mode was locked behind a paywall with features and characters that should have been in at launch. We instantly come up against the fact that the batmotank with all its iterations is what youll be stuck with for the majority of the game. Because Rocksteady couldnt be bothered to work weapons or features for the tank into all the other Batmobiles. And the MAJORITY of the game is what were talking about here. Every few seconds you have to stop what youre going or leave where youre fighting to go get the tank and do something in some other part of Gotham. Then you have to come back and  surprise surprise surprise  a bunch of TANKS have shown up while you were gone. Rinse and repeat as needed. Tired of the tank yet? Tough shit  because now the Riddler wants a piece of you and hes decided the only way to bring your ass down is to challenge you and your batmotank to a perverted weirdass green version of Speed Racer that will leave you actively curing your screen. Moving on past the mess that is the Batmobile and the DLC we come to the basic nontank gameplay. The combat in this game is faster than its predecessors  and the number of enemies are through the roof. But  again  we come to a corner that Rocksteady cut. Youll be impressed with the NUMBER of foes... but not only do most of them look exactly the same  but they all FUNCTION the same. Unlike City and Origins and even Asylum to an extent the enemies are always the same lowlevel goons you encounter at the beginning of the game. There are all these new types of enemies  all these new abilities they have  but unless youre playing a mission you wont encounter them. The streets are full of the same cardboard cutout thug and that is what youll be facing seventy to eighty percent of the time when you arent cruisin for chicks and suckin face in your batmotank. Worst of all  under all this steaming mess  you get the feeling throughout the game that this SHOULD be fun. You hear that kid in the back of your head saying how much fun this SHOULD be  and if you havent played another Arkham game its VERY likely you wont even notice the flaws unless youre on the PC until your running around in your tank... again. ,BatmanArkham,cy9vpp4,1,t5_2y9q4

There are also some good novelizations based on superheroes that are well worth reading.I actually prefer to read No Mans Land in the novelization that was released because the comics covering the event spread into a halfdozen titles over a very long period of time. See if your library has the novelization of Batman No Mans Land written by Greg Rucka. Its a more efficient way of reading the entire thing and Ruckas prose is very compelling.,BatmanArkham,d6tdskz,2,t5_2y9q4

9393946,0,t3_598ysh,Also upset that Origins didnt get a remaster. Considering that at least on console its the one title in the series that would have benefited the most from it.I dont think it has the best story in the series personally. I like to give that distinction to Arkham Asylum even though Asylums story kind of falls apart with its ending. But I do think Origins has the best presentation of story. It had very solid direction and its writing was a little more consistent I think. But this said I just dont think its as interesting of a narrative as it wanted to be.I thought the twist involving Black Maskspoiler was kind of lame and the way the story is set up feels a little more gamey than the other titles. Which ends up being at odds with the games direction and even its writing to an extent since in a lot of respects it ends up feeling more cinematic than what came before it. And this is to mention nothing of the continuity it destroys but honestly I can look past that stuff and accept it for what it is.Origins strong suit with its story is that it really does have these great cinematic moments throughout it. Production wise it feels decidedly less like Batman The Animated Series than the other titles do but thats not an inherently bad thing. I like that they did something a little different with it. As much as I love Dinis writing on the previous games it can sometimes get a little muddled. I dont get that issue from Origins as it has probably the most straightforward narrative of the series which is definitely something I can appreciate. I just wish its concepts were stronger.,BatmanArkham,d96qz23,18,t5_2y9q4

The one thing I have a problem with like so many others is too many tank battles. I liked the Batmobile. Driving it around the city is fun getting in car chases is awesome and a couple tank battles were fine. When they shoved a ton of tank battles down your throat is when I started having issues with the Batmobile. Also even though a lot of its short I also really enjoyed the Season of Infamy DLC and the short character stories DLC. All in all I really enjoyed Arkham Knight.,BatmanArkham,dd8u82k,4,t5_2y9q4

And even if she had shes dead and Ras could be too.
