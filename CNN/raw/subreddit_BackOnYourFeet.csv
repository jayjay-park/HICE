7400056,0,t3_4go3kt,Here is my opinion as a person who as been in an addictive relationship and yours is addictive no doubt you have got to walk away. You have to. You guys dont work. No nothing is going to make this work. Youre not going to just magically wake up one day and be emotionally stable and forget all of the things that happened in the past get married have kids and be this perfect little family. Its going to hurt like hell but if you care about her and about yourself youll walk away from her. Love does not work this way. Its not hurt its not pain  its not suicide. You guys are two kids trying to do a very grown up thing. Take it from someone who has been there. I was actually in an abusive relationship physically and mentally from the ages of . That relationship brought out the worst in both of us. Then one night as I was driving him to his house and he was begging me to get back with him like he had done so many times before in my head I thought I cant keep doing this. I dropped him off at his house told him Id call him the next day and never spoke to or saw him ever again. It was the best thing I could have ever done for myself cause when you have someone that you love that much that doesnt give a damn about youthey disguise it as love they say they love you and then rip your heart out over and over again its not worth it. Youre so young and you have so much to learn. You should be out having fun learning growing not sitting around crying over someone else. Work on yourself. Trust me. Live your life or youre going to wake up one day and have so many regrets.,BackOnYourFeet,d2jc5ro,2,t5_2vl3d
