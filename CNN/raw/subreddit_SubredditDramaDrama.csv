During the day on the floor the leastfriendly mood anyone is ever in is busy working. At night when the lecture halls are converted into makeshift bars it is the nicest easiest to talk to group of strangers I encounter all year.  I talk to a lot of people theyre all having positive experiences and there is an unfortunately waning sense of community as the conference literally started out as a party for hobbyists many years ago. Then when I come home I check our industry news outlets the inevitable reviews of the conference are that there is harassment happening all over that it was not a safe space this is a work environment staff needs to do more staff was actively in on the harassment etc...  I wonder what conference these people attended. The wet blankets start taking agreeable positions on behavior and stretching them into justifications that no one should act rambunctious or get day drunk.

3076108,0,t1_cogqyvx,In the world of modern feminism imagined oppression is a currency.The idea is to push the border of others ability to suspend disbelief.The more oppressive a claim or the more egregious the offense being alleged the more oppression points are earned.  Oppression points are used to purchase twitter followers.  The goal is to convert those twitter followers into patreon.com contributors.If all goes according to plan one need only manufacture a little internet drama a few tines a week in order to receive cash subsidies from white knights men who imagine women will sleep with them if they act as attack drones when these women call out hits on twitter.Anyway oppression points earned increase in accordance with those groups one claims to fight for.  These are mostly uppermiddle class white women so the tendency is to claim to represent and protect smaller groups who have historically struggled with integrating into society.This is a predatory practice as these groups are used as BOOSTERS to help improve a twitterfeminists earned points totals.Two groups who are often championed by these fierce defenders of liberty are trans women and WoC which is basically a catchall for nonwhite women.My previous post was mocking their tendency to oneup by naming increasingly smaller groups because the individual who can win the hand of the groups which have the best combination of sympathyinspiration and inferred hardship give the highest score multipliers.To an outside observer this tactic of demographic separation looks quite a bit like old racist law in America commonly called Jim Crow but also known as separate but equal.Also by creating new imaginary forms of misogyny a defender can also boost their score due to being able to make additional false claims against oppressive groups like the everpopular patriarchy.They ac as debuffs allowing reater imagined damage.  If you can get x debuffs on an imagined representative of the patriarchy...or someone exhibiting toxic masculinity  then you will do HUGE imagined damage..thus you need to create new and exciting forms of imaginary misogyny.Trans women are women.  Hatred of women is misogyny.  there is no need whatsoever for use of transmisogyny because a new word would only be necessary if the existing word did not apply which it does.,SubredditDramaDrama,cogu4hv,1,t5_2ss6f

4864995,0,t1_cu7psct,Going to preface this with the fact that Im kind of tired.  Its getting late here.  A bit sleepy.gt My point of view is pretty simple people who study a subject more than others tend to have more accurate or justified views about it. Thats what uadefinitedescription was trying to say.gtI really dont understand how people can disagree with this.Well since you stated your opinion politely and straight to the point Ill state mine politely and straight to the point  correctness does not come from studying the subject  and that might sound counterintuitive but it really isnt.  Correctness comes from facts that are challenged until they cannot be challenged.  There are always articles about how the Texas Schoolboard is going to dictate what our kids are going to be taught  things like removing references to slavery and shining a better light on historical figures that did ugly things.  If you spent your entire life studying out of those books you would know a lot about what those books told you but almost nothing about the things not in those books.  Ultimately though you would be unreliable when it came to talking about those subjects in their entirety.  People are unreliable whether they are well meaning or not.  An example I would be is Ancient Aliens.  Yes the shitty tv show.  If the person behind Ancient Aliens spent  years studying the TV show do you believe their views about Aliens existing in the past and shaping the future would be more correct based on the fact that he studied the subject and should therefore have a more accurate or justified view about the subject?That is why I was trying to say.  If someone made a bad argument and attempted to sidestep the fact that their argument was bad by trying to claim they are inherently more right just because of a position of authority  I honestly believe you would recognize that rightly so as a fallacious appeal to authority.  gtI really dont understand how people can disagree with this.The part people disagree with twofold  one is the presumption of fact and the other is lack of verifiability.  I dont know what percentage numbers you had in mind when you said tend to have more accurate or justified views about it but you clearly didnt say they are always right or wrong since the word tend implies a trend sometimes going one way sometimes going the other.  The fact of the matter is though that there will be times in which the expert is wrong.  That is understandable because people are people.  Were just animals.  Its okay for us to be wrong.  The problem comes when there is a lack of recognizing that when we talk about where we base our evidence from.  One would expect that if questioned an expert would produce the reasoning for his thoughts  whether it was something simplified for a casual viewer or something extremely complex that only an expert would understand.  Evidence is something concrete and assuming the evidence is not outright falsified something that will not be wrong  since a fact is a fact.  a different topic entirely is talking about falsified and maliciously framing evidence which is in my opinion rampant  If experts were  right  of the time I would be with you in saying that simply by virtue of being an authority means it is right.  That isnt the case though.  We trust experts to interpret this data but we ultimately rely on the data itself for our decisions and arguments  or at least we should because it would be fallacious to logically rely on an authorities word based solely on the fact that they are an authority.  Regarding verifiability let us assume that experts are  accurate  of the time.  When someone is sharing their ideas pseudoanonymously unless someone doxxes your friendwhich nobody is going to do for something frankly as dumb as this there is NO WAY anybody is going to know what he is saying about his expertise is true.  Without a way to even verify his expertise which again would be fallacious to solely rely on it is irrelevant as to whether they are an expert or not.  There is no trust since no reason to trust was given.  I believe that is what appeals to authority should be  appeals to trust that person so they have time to explain to people who are not authorities.  I do want to point out that I dont believe I actually dismissed your friends argument  because honestly I didnt even read that far into the linked drama.  SRDD almost never gets this much traffic I skimmed the linked post noticed that they mentioned they were an authority on the subject without any evidence and without showing reason as to why that is relevant to the argument being made and made my comment.  Them using the fallacy doesnt even actually diminish their argument  which would be the fallacy fallacy you might see posted  only the trust people might have with that person.  So I really am genuinely perplexed as to why rbp took such an interest in what I thought was an innocuous comment.  If any of this response didnt make sense point it out and Ill try to figure out what I was trying to say  Im pretty of tired as its getting pretty late here.,SubredditDramaDrama,cu7rq88,2,t5_2ss6f

But it boils down to people overreact to infidelity with many reasons given why as well as other supporting arguments.gtFurthermore you can discuss morals without saying what one ought to do. It is an entire branch of ethicsWhats it called?gtAnd even if you were correctly arguing for a normative standard pertaining to infidelity you can do so without the I know better than you attitude.I think youre unfairly attributing that attitude to me because you seem to think I disagree with you and heres why means I think Im better than you which is boring and ridiculous.gtIn regard to your stance on fidelity proportional to what? Like freaking out over a murder makes sense. Freaking out equally over a dropped ice cream cone doesnt. Infidelity lies somewhere between those two extremes. If it was a continuum with murder on the right and ice cream on the left I think infidelity should be further to the left.So to answer your question proportional to how serious it actually is.gtPerhaps your beginning to see why everyone is giving you such a fuck off attitude Dolores Umbridge.

So theres this one slave that calls himself Andre right? Hes pretty muscular and ripped because hes gotta move around a bunch of heavy farmer shit for like  hours a day or something. So John has to go on a trip out of town for a while so hes assigned Andre bodyguard duty and he can stay in the house for this time. Before he goes hes explaining to his wife Annabelle Andre will stay in the home with you to keep you safe. Hes the big one out there. Hes big everywhere. Big biceps chest muscles doesnt skip leg day oh and hes got a pretty big dick tbh gtgt Of course annabelle will perk up at this last one A big hwhat?gtgt Well his dick. Its huge and monstrous looking. Cause yknow its all beastlike or uh something. No proper lady would want that right? But yeah.
