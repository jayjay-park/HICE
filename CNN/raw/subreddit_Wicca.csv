104084,0,t1_ceq8na0,Yes the first time I did a  hour spell I found myself totally exhausted by the time I had finished.  It may help to do your workings at some other time of the day.  I often choose the dawn although I am partial to Midnight as well.  And yes teaching is certainly one of the most noble callings.  I just received an insight that I should mention the means of obtaining your goal in case you dont know.  You do this simply by breaking your goal down into steps and those steps into smaller doable actions.  Ask yourself each step of the way What will I do now?  Okay You I reminded her.As for being the working poor you are certainly not alone in our once prosperous land.  But even that will likely get better although its taking its sweet time in coming.  I have a small real estate company that used to do very well until the crash.  Now were essentially gutted cut off at the knees.  But hopefully that too will improve.  And if I didnt have my connection with Goddess and the occasional get my ass out of hock spell I dont know what I would do but I honestly think I would be fucked. Not being able to control your consciousness at this point would be the norm.  Few people ever grasp it fully.  But like anything it take dedicated practice something that may be hard since its a little like trying to pick yourself up by your boot straps as the saying goes.  How do you generate enough control to control your consciousness.Again try the holding still exercise.  You can also try resonating the sound Om between breaths.  So again just find a comfortable spot breath deeply until your body feels totally at ease and relaxed.  Then steer your mind away from thoughts of the past of the future.  This takes a little practice.  When your mind strays just gently bring it back to the present.  Dont think listenreceive. Experience. When you are ready exhale half way and stop your breath.  Now just feel the energy that is at the roots of your existence.  If it doesnt happen start breathing again.  Here you may wish to resonate Om a few times.  Try to let the sound reverberate through your body.  Now try holding still and not breathing again.  If you dont feel it breath again and Om it out.  At first you may only get a taste of your energy body but thats all you need to start.  The more you do it the easier it gets until you can feel the energy coursing through your body.Dont be concerned if this is not clear.  Its one of those things that are hard to describe in words.  You have to experience it for yourself.  Its like trying to tell someone how to have an orgasm or what its like.  Or even falling asleep if they have never done so.  Once you find it the rest will be obvious.  There is nothing so useful in a persons life is being able to control ones mind.  The way to balance is for the spirit to control the mind and the mind to control the body.  So often it is the opposite. Oh one more thing this is one of those things that the harder your try the harder it is to do.  And here think orgasm and falling asleep.  The best way is to just let it happen.,Wicca,ceqa513,1,t5_2rgn5

199165,0,t1_cf132z2,Thank you for your feedback! I do try to meditate but I have anxiety which makes it difficult to shut my brain down I have lived with it for most of my life and am taking care of it. I am actually pretty much over my anxiety but the fact that I know I HAVE to try to calm my thoughts down only makes them race faster when I try to meditate! I guess I just have to keep at it. Do you find that you can retain all of the images you see or are there many? Just a few?The question is more complicated than yesno.

222242,0,t3_1wm7b5,Without sharing any oathbound material how was your initiation ritual  what sort of feelings or thoughts did you experience?     It was just as meaningful if not more so than my wedding.  I experienced excitement that this isnt real feeling a little bit of fear or anxiety bliss and love. The first time you practiced skyclad with your coven  did you have any nerves or did you feel comfortable?     I think youre supposed to have nerves at first.  It sort of heightens the energy of the experience.  However since that time I have also moved to where there is a nudist colony across the street and I have been in so many skyclad circles that it no longer evokes the same nerves and thats okay too.Did you get along well with other coven members despite not having worked with them before?     Yes and no.  Ive had the pleasure of circling with many covens.  As with any group of people together over the years there will be personal disagreements between particular members.  There are members with which Ive never had an issue there are members that have had one big dramatic personal argument with me and the training relationship has a particular dynamic that can cause stress and power struggles as you reach different stages of spiritual development.  If you had to miss an Esbat or Sabbat for regular daily life things work illness etc. did it cause any tension between you and your coven?When anyone has to miss a meeting they have to request a boon from the Queen before it is allowed at all.  Ive never known a situation in which a boon wasnt granted but Ive also not seen somebody take huge advantage of it.  Ive VERY rarely missed a circle and when I did it was definitely regretted more by myself than the coven. ,Wicca,cf3rboj,2,t5_2rgn5
225907,0,t1_cf42jyj,SMH. Thats not hostility. All Ive tried to do is participate in this community. Ive only been here for about a week. People have voted every one of my posts up to  status post after post. Dozens of people vote them up yet the comments from  or  of the same people over and over seem to be disparaging critical or made to put a person on the defensive. I dont know what I did originally but Im sorry. I never meant to flare that nerve. And Im sorry for pushing back instead of being receptive from the get go. I have not had a chance to peruse through the content here. I help run a huge church in size not wealth that takes up a large portion of my time. I am working on learning the lines for a  day long play in which Im playing Herakles. Not to mention there is the Boy Child who has to be taken to school every day and picked up after band. It was never my intention NOT to contribute. I talk on Facebook all day. It was only ever my intention to contribute. I hear that its important to add to the dialogue. My only objection has ever been that I have a natural push back against being told what to do. Im an Aries.

480919,0,t1_cfuppxp,I think that the lineage branch of Wicca draws the same type of personality that are drawn to reconstructionist groups.  People who have a deep seated need to know that theyre doing things right draw comfort from the fact that their practice is derived from Gardner Sanders Ancient Greek or other original groups.If you combine that personality type with a good dosage of insecurity it makes it very easy to look down upon the eclectics and solitaries because theyre just making stuff up and calling themselves witches.,Wicca,cfuxmd5,2,t5_2rgn5

When I chose which religion to research I had no idea how much I would identify with Wicca. I have done extensive research on many religions but none have been so interesting and appealing to me. My research will definitely continue long after I finish my paper. So if if Im understanding correctly initiation is like adult baptism and Wiccanings are like infant baptisms? To what extent is joining a coven advised? Thank you for answering my questions so genuinely. I really appreciate it. ,Wicca,cgzgnml,3,t5_2rgn5
923346,0,t1_ch8zli5,No the concept of magic is not unique to Wicca by any means. Magic was often part of pagan societies though the degree of which most surely varied. While it is not part of Christianity and thus not a part of much of modern culture it has been used by many cultures throughout Christianitys existence.I like your mentioning magic as the power of thought. I think many people would see it that way though others may conceptualize it as a force which we can tap into not necessary something inherent to us. Isaac Bonewitss Real Magic would probably offer more information for you I cant say Ive never read it and his Real Energy discusses the conceptualization of energy insofar as it is a substance for magical workthat is energy is the noun magic is the verb.I would caution you against exploring Wicca just for its relationship with magic. Wicca is foremost a religion a relationship to the divine and nature insofar as they are separate. This relationship must also be considered. Wicca without the divine is not Wicca though I know there are others on this subreddit who would disagree per other discussions weve had. It seems the general consensus that this is more appropriately called witchcraft but many still equate Wicca and Witchcraft these days so this not a guaranteed understanding.Hope this helps!,Wicca,ch98n9x,0,t5_2rgn5

I think they should be allowed to continue on their journey without us attempting to pull them back into what theyve left behind. I honor and remember my beloved dead at Samhain and throughout my life and I think thats the important and appropriate thing.I guess one question worth asking is if the personalities we knew in one life can somehow stick around while the soul itself moves onto the Summerland. Maybe they do and maybe that residual energy is what people contact or interact with in the case of hauntings. I really dont know.

1518894,0,t1_cj6nmwm,Good point. A.J.Drew made the argument that the morals that apply to physical actions should apply to spells. He said that if putting on cologne and wearing nice clothes wasnt a form of manipulation then a love spell shouldnt be either. Yet his argument here is flawed. A love spell is a way of spiritually forcing yourself on to someone who never really gave their consent. This may be an extreme statement on my part but that sounds a little rapey. Wearing cologne and dressing well in the physical sense is more like casting a spell to make yourself more sexy and attractive. Thats waaaayyy different than making a specific person a target of your love spell. ,Wicca,cj6o51y,3,t5_2rgn5

1598746,0,t3_2ccqa2,I have had to deal with this before.  Said friend was very toxic and very close to my circle of friends. I told her that I wanted nothing to do with her anymore told her never to contact me again and then blocked her on all social media.  To prevent splash damage I then informed all of my mutual friends with her about what I did and why.  I said to them that this is a choice I had to make for my own well being and that I was not going to tell them what they should think of her or who they could and could not be friends with.  All worked out well for all involved and my peace of mind was restored.  You cannot let a toxic person feed off your energies but you cannot tell others what to do.  Openness and honesty is likely your best policy  roaches tend to skitter away when you shine lights on them.

I know thats shitty and painful and hard to accept but I think you are so emotionally distraught right now that youre not thinking straight. Relationships end every day for mundane reasons. Just because you do not want this to be true does not mean that there is a magical cause to him leaving you. The chances of that are incredibly slim and I would be very wary of these psychics.

1861690,0,t1_ckdgm8w,Okay heres what I would do.  I warn you this isnt nice but if you really need to get rid of this person this will do it. I dont work off of solid recipes so Ill write out a general description of the kind of thing that I would do and you can either follow it step by step or add your own style.Ingredients Wooden box Red figure candle Black salt White salt Black pepper Im allergic to Jalapenos but my partner uses their seeds in something like this.Start by taking the candle and the item you have that is his.  Make a little hole in the back and say I consecrate you and make you a representation of ltnamegt.  ltNamegt you are now under my control. Add to the hold the thing you get the represents them. Hold it and imagine the person you are trying to get rid of and in your head really believe that figure is the person.  Since you dont really like the person looking at it should really despise you.  Make another little hole at the bottom and add in the pepper.  Stand him on your alter and light the top of his head on fire the wick comes out of the head and declare Unless you go away you will go crazy your mind will melt and all thoughts of me will make you sick. Go away and leave me be! Then keep chanting Go away and leave me be until the head is melted.  Sprinkle some black and white salt into the melted wax and let it dry.  Then stick the whole thing in the box and cover it with more of both salts and bury box and all in the ground. NOT ON YOUR PROPERTY! The most traditional place would be at a crossroads.  As I recovered the hole with the box in it I would say You are out of my life forever you will haunt my doorstep no more! So mote it be!One key thing to note is that for this to work you have to break off all communication.  For example if this person visits you at work you will make someone else take care of him or just walk away. Defriend him and disconnect from him unless your career requires you do otherwise. Dont obsess over being obsessed over this is one of the main ways that banishing like this fail.,Wicca,ckdj11x,4,t5_2rgn5

I ended up leaving Sokka Gokkai USA after  years when it had occurred to me they are probably a cult. They said weird things like if you give a large donation then you will be repayed in riches and the closer you looked into that practice you would see they were worshiping their President President Ikeda as a God and I kept thinking this is not right. None of this makes any sense. Why were they worshiping this man who is clearly human. No one genuinely cared for each other. They only cared for enlightenment. So I left. But I was heart broken because I have my Gohonzon scroll and I took a vow to keep it. I am not saying that it was all bullshit but there were a bunch of people following a guy and hoping he would solve their problems.Long story short is I took my Buddhist alter and I changed it to my Wiccan alter.

2938849,0,t3_2tt2u4,Black candle Paper and pen Black string Tablespoon curry Tablespoon dried dill Tablespoon powdered ginger Black mojo bag Waning moon  This will work best if you know who has cursed you. Go outside under the waning moon. Focus on the person who has cursed you. Write out their full name and date of birth fold the paper in thirds and place it in the mojo bag. Add the ginger add the curry and last add the dill. The idea is to completely bury the paper in the bag. Light the candle and let seven drops of wax fall into the bag.  Close the bag. Bind it shut with the black string using nine knots. Each time you tie a knot say the name of the person out loud. Bury the bag where it will remain safe and snuff your candle. Leave the bag in place until the waxing moon.At the waxing moon take the same candle you used to begin this spell and dig up your bag. Burn it burying the ashes in the same place as the bag was initially buried.

How what you practice differs from the average Wiccan is the way you are thinking about magic.  Youre saying that in your practice magic is a sort of manipulation of the brain a sort of over glorified meditation.  A Wicca is taught when they are taught Wicca to believe in the magic fully and to trust it.  With that belief and a strong enough will they do work that creates the change that they want to see around them. Even if that means money falls out of the sky.

This doesnt just apply to magick it applies to everything drugs alcohol driving putting on a certain type of clothing talking to someone etc. The rules of magick are largely the rules of the mundane as well  dont do anything you dont want to do. Personally and for reasons that are entirely my own and not applicable to others I never perform black magick or even white magick on others without permission. Im considering revising that last part but it can be a little complex at what point does it switch?. If youre like me and just feel like black magick isnt what you should be doing then dont do it. You can change your mind you can try again later there are lots of options available to you. Personally I think that black and white magick can work in harmony but that its a fine balance to tread. I dont do black magick in part because Im genuinely concerned that I wouldnt know when to stop  if youre interested Ill tell you the story of the incident that finally caused me to swear off magickal alterations on others forever. However Ive found recently that Im becoming more comfortable with the idea of beneficial magick on others without their explicit consent i.e explicitly asking for magickal aid largely as my herbalism and medicinal magick practice has grown. ,Wicca,cqe4ait,6,t5_2rgn5

We have a dedicant program that teaches both generic basics as well as tradition specific training so that upon initiation the new priestess will be able to easily step into their new role. And we have monthly workshop of some sort each month to continue our growth as individuals and as a group.

4382586,0,t1_csfq9x2,Maybe this will help  there are many different beliefs among individual Wiccans that will differ.Monotheism Some Wiccans believe that a single creative force exists in the universe which is sometimes called The One or The All. Little can be known of this force. Other Wiccans  typically feminists  worship the Goddess by herself. Bitheism a.k.a. Duotheism Many regard the Goddess and the God as representing the female and male aspects of the All. These deities are not out there somewhere they are immanent in the world. Others regard the God and Goddess as two separate deities representing the male and female principles.Polytheism Many regard the thousand of ancient pagan Gods and Goddesses Athena Brigit Diana Fergus Odin Pan Zeus etc. as representing various aspects of the God and Goddess. The term Wicca normally implies that the persons religion is based upon Celtic spiritual concepts its pantheon of deities and seasonal days of celebration. Other Neopagans include deities beliefs practices and symbols from ancient Pagan religions e.g. Egyptian Greek various mystery religions Roman Sumerian or upon Aboriginal religions Native American Spirituality Shamanism.Pantheism Some Wiccans believe that the universe is divine and should be revered. Pantheism identifies the universe with God but denies any personality or transcendence of such a God.Agnosticism Some Wiccans are actually Agnostics who take no position on the existence of a supreme being or beings. They often look upon the Goddess and the God as archetypes based on myth.Strong Atheism Some Wiccans are strong Atheists and maintain that no deity exists. They often view the God and Goddess as concepts or principles not as living entities. ,Wicca,csjnjh4,1,t5_2rgn5

I would be lying to say that the community is uniformly supportive of or even understanding of these people but in general tolerance and understanding is pretty good certainly better than in the world at large.  Some wiccans put a lot of effort into finding ways to make the community and our forms of worship more compatible with LGBT. For myself I see little need for this in the context of transgender folk. If someone identifies with the masculine side of the duality for instance it matters little to me what genitals they happen to have. And if they dont identify with the duality at all there are deities you can work with which avoid that.

4544936,0,t3_3dayub,Finally something the Elemental Wiccan can be an expert on! At least I hope I would be considered an expert.In a sense there are two elements. Light and Dark. But they are considered opposing but complementary forces not elements. Any element has a Light component and a Dark component. Fire is a great example. Its Light side or the side of Creation and Order gives us warmth and cooks food. On the Dark side or Destruction and Chaos it burns humans and their homes.So why four elements? The tradition is twofold. One comes from Native American shamanism. The other is the Ancient Greek tradition. Both noted that certain aspects of their surroundings such as the seasons the winds and the stages of life came in fours and reflected that in their mythology. At its core mythology is a way to explain the unexplainable. Its also a way to connect with ones surroundings. The seasons come in fours the wise ones must have thought. Man also has four seasons. Birth youth adulthood old age. There must be a connection. Thus the mythos was born.I applaud you for asking the question and allowing us all to participate in your thinking process.

4909401,0,t3_3ht8p7,If you think of your BOS as a record of your personal progression through your craft and your craft as a relationship with deity I would not suggest trying to pass it on to your next incarnation. Just as you would not like someone to pass along secrets to your new lover or to make judgments on your behavior as a child according to what others have done with their children it may not be advisable to send deeply personal hints to your next incarnation about your current relationship with deity. That is part of the mystery of the craft. Discovering anew your relationship with deity is the greatest and most powerful parts of this a MYSTERY religion.

4936296,0,t1_cuglxws,Once upon a time it was suggested that one not begin the study of the  Kabbalah until the age of .  The idea was that in order to begin a study of the deeper mysteries one needed to be in a place in life where things were relatively stable where children would reasonably be grown at least to an age of almost independence and one could devote the time and attention needed fr the study.        There were and still are some Wiccan coven leaders who maintained a similar philosophy to the taking of students.  That is somewhat understandable at least insofar as a teacher has every right to expect a commiserate time commitment from a student.        All of that said if you are studying on your own I would advice refocusing your efforts on other things.  Rituals meditations... these are tools which can be used to worship but they are not the only ones.  A ritual doesnt need to have lit quarter candles dedicated tools chanting and such instead they can be as simple as leaving an offering at an alter on a shelf preparing a certain meal in a certain way on a certain day etc.  Meditation doesnt have to be a passive activity requiring a certain amount of time and quiet instead it can be an active activity accomplished while walking a certain path braiding a childs hair getting dressed for the day.        If your goal is to increase your connection to and understanding of the divine remember that all of the bells and whistles while effective are by no means the only or even the best way to go about it.  The Craft is a living breathing spirituality that should blend with your life not bend your life.  As time passes and children grow up and I say this as someone who began as a teenager continued through the birth of  children and am currently adapting to the presence of a teenager in my house you will find your experiences only grow in depth and meaning.,Wicca,cugrcro,3,t5_2rgn5

In his previous article he sighed the seasons as he experienced them in Brazil summer  hot and long winter  short and wet. This struck me as I spent the last  years living in interior Alaska where there are  seasons Summer short and mild Fall very short and cool First winter cold and snowey Second Winter deadly cold and completely dark Third winter warming with mud snow ice rain Break Up Warm and Muddy.

5168757,0,t3_3lt3oz,Awesome! I think youll find that Wicca as a spiritual practice is incredibly diverse and flexible. You can draw inspiration from just about every and anything. You can choose to worship in whichever way suits your individual spiritual needs and even this I think youll find is an everevolving journey. As for the God issue some people who are coming from a monotheistic upbringing just continue on worshipping one central Godhead and if they do choose to incorporate other spiritual beings some will just view that as a manifestation of that one God. However some are polytheistic and choose also to honor many Gods and Goddesses that are distinct and separate in their own respects. Some are even atheistic Wiccans and only view the Gods and Goddesses as Jungian archetypes that are within every human psyche. Its all up to you! Thats the beauty of this practice.

Invoke the watchtowers. Ask your God and Goddess to help the spell to be aligned with your true desire and to help bless the spell with their energy. State your intent I do this spell to protect myself from the harm being done to me by  and it is my will that it protect me and stop  from doing me harm.Light the black candle. Take your image of the person and wrap it slowly with the cord or ribbon saying I bind you  from hurting yourself or others. Bind the whole image.Lay the image down and sprinkle it with salt.

5230447,0,t1_cvgg480,gtSo?  Let them think its bad.  Theyre going to think what they think regardless of the definition of cult anyway.  Yes and this Is why we shouldnt associate with the word cult. People perceive it as negative and Theres little to do to change that. Average people thinking were dangerous is one thing what happens when its legislators and other politicians?gtIts not like theyre Google Wicca and be turned away from it because of that. I think youre assuming too much about how people process information. If someones first encounter with Wicca is a definition that calls it a cult they probably wont think to highly of us. First impressions are lasting impressions and people are more inclined to believe the information they learned first rather than accept contradictory information they encounter later even if that contradictory information is correct.gtAnd it is a cult regardless of how you feel.  You either need to change the definition of the word cultThis isnt how language works. You cant just change the definition of a word. All language is is a series of Sounds that weve agreed have specific meanings. Language speakers inform definitions not the other way around. Thats why Merriam Webster for example updates its dictionary so often. Language evolves.gtor be good and informative against ignorance.And one way to do this is to have clarity in definitions. You need to appeal to peoples existing understanding of the world. Since most people associate the word cult with dangerous organizations we shouldnt use it to define ourselves. Using the word cult only spreads ignorance. It doesnt prevent it. It confuses people.,Wicca,cvggkjl,2,t5_2rgn5

Thats where the Wiccan Sabbats came from. Thats why the Solstices and Equinoxes are referred to their Germanic counterpart while the High Days are referred to their Celtic counterparts. Exception is Mabon the Autumnal Equinox with a controversial name that has origins with a Welsh god named Mabon ap Modron However the term came about from a Witch in the sAnd no we dont have to.

That doesnt change the fact that your language was also inappropriate and was very angrily expressed and had it been said in person to a woman would have been threatening. Women are the most often harassed at these things followed by lgbt folks. These rules arent for you theyre for them.I think Ill be leaving the sub for a while. Your nastiness and general attitude of everything being about you is too much to take. You dont believe in ADHD or mental illness you think every question is resolved with join a coven you dont recognize that people have different lifestyles or practices and youre very combative. It bothers me that three males with very traditional views generally over run this sub  It should be noted i dont think there is anything inherently bad or whatever about this just the lack of balance I tried to bring a more mild and female perspective but Ive gotten frustrated. Anyway Ive been stressed and anxious lately due to real life stuff so I think its best for me to step back. Too often I find myself messaging my friends about this sub frustrated. One told me a couple weeks ago I should just leave but I do feel like I gained a lot from the sub especially because so many views are dissenting at times.

6413225,0,t3_43j8qm,It is a general truth that the more you work on getting over a trauma the more you are focusing on the trauma and the worse it gets.  There have been studies done which show that professional grief counseling extends and exacerbates grief rather than helping people get past their grief.  The best way to deal with and get over an emotional trauma is to focus mental and emotional energy on something else.  Any process focused on getting over the physical and emotional pain will give it energy rather than diminish its energy.  Making a child is a extremely complex process that has millions of ways to go wrong.  A developing mass of flesh with a mistake is better off as a miscarriage than as a lifetime as a mistake.  The best thing you can do is to CELEBRATE that the mother survived the experience and that a defective child was not created.   Then you can go out to dinner and dancing to celebrate your love for each other.   In a few weeks when she is ready she can try again.  The next time it will all work correctly.  ,Wicca,czimad4,-2,t5_2rgn5

6861610,0,t1_d0tdmi5,gtCould you explain exactly what you mean?Sure no problem. I think that the acts found in ritual of meditation reflection and visualization in a Wiccan context in this case positively affect our psyche in the neurological ways stated above as well as by simple motivation. By doing those rituals that changing of our consciousness influences our ability to act and better allows the results of our actions to flow with our will. On top of this you have the Jungian side ofmcommunicating with your unconscious mind via symbols archetypal images and other symbolically significant acts e.g. divination which is actually very important for maintaining sanity aquiring inner knowledge and to avoid neurosis and psychosis. Of course its also emotionally satisfying which is more important than people think and I definitely agree with spells to forgive ease anxiety gain confidence mourn a loved one etc. I just dont think there is an intermediate force pulling the strings.

Norse deities are probably the most benevolent of ancient gods and they really care about their followers effectively making Midgard habitable for people.

8601565,0,t3_4xm833,This book cover has many instruments on it. Ill explain some. Theres the athame which is a twosided dagger used to direct energy cast circles and bless things. This one is beautiful Theres the cup which is a chalice which represents the Goddess womb and is used for wine which is blessed. Theres the censer which incense is burned in to bless the circle. This is traditional the use of sage or a bundle of sage is not traditional but a newer practice. The sword is like the athame but more formal and in a way more powerful.The broom is a phallic symbol representative of the Horned God and can be jumped over for fertility or after a handfasting marriage or held as a symbol of fertility.I dont think a bundle of sage is a tool in Wicca but more many Wiccans today choose to do.

In this reddit we fairly often get questions from some child who tried using a Ouija board and contacted a spirit who hasnt gone away.  Never conjure anything you dont know how to banish.

8777305,0,t3_50bo0e,Pentacles theyre not a big thing in the version of Witchcraft I practice. I have studied Wicca too and yes I have several. I wore them a lot more when I was younger and lived elsewhere but people are still not as accepting where I live now and wearing one outside my shirt particularly on the job can be problematic. Lots of church people here and not all of them are cool that way.I have a  year old heirloom Cimaruta that I wear a lot. Its more in tune with what I do and almost no one here has ever recognized it for what it is so its not something that causes me any problems wearing it in public or at work. People ask I just say its an antique necklace and an heirloom family thing. I pretty much leave it at that. I also have several totem animal things that I wear that I also consider protective charms. Being Pagan its not something I shout out a lot offline. I want to have my jewelry but I also like to keep what I am wearing a bit more hidden than obvious.What I do is my business and in my tradition it is normal to be a bit more secretive about being a Witch. If you saw me on the street you would not likely know I was Pagan unless you are very up on your symbols. Almost nobody sees my raven rings or my skulls and cats and says Ah ha! Shes a Witch! They just think Im a bit goth with my jewelry thats all and I am. I love interesting and vaguely spooky jewelry antique jewelry in general so its not unusual for me to be seen wearing something like that. You want to wear a pentacle more power to you but there are other symbols other ways to do the same thing where you will know but it wont attract as much negative attention. ,Wicca,d72ty12,4,t5_2rgn5

10296571,0,t3_5nadd7,Im the same.  Ive found this on Correllian Wicca really fits in with my beliefs.  The way I see it it doesnt matter whether you see the deities as entities in themselves or as anthropomorphisms of a divine energy or the universe itself because both are equally valid and both are a good basis for meaningful spiritual experiences that in my view are Wiccan.,Wicca,dcb67i6,3,t5_2rgn5

Sabbat Box is cheaper  per box but theres currently a waiting list and has been for at least a year. Witch Box is available now but its nearly  per box. Are there any others out there?

10376731,0,t1_dck96zm,To a certain degree they are set out for us in wicca. The goddess is the moon and dark and silver and etc. The God is her opposite.But these are not the same as what human kind dictates as male and female. The goddess is a healer and a warrior the God the same. Its that the complement and contradict each other equally. Both can nurture both can destroy. However if you completely disregard the duality of life and the universe Wicca may not be for you.,Wicca,dck9l2h,4,t5_2rgn5

I think itd be good to do so if you havent had a chance to really sit down and meditate about the return of the sun planting of seeds etc.  or whatever it is you do  because whether you do it slightly late or not itll help you keep a sense of continuity as the wheel turns.  Im sure the God and the Goddess wont mind if youre a little late celebrating.  ,Wicca,ddd1svq,2,t5_2rgn5

10799539,0,t1_ddr4ifv,gtTake some time sit down and ask yourself. Why do I still believe witchcraft is wrong? Youll probably get a fairly simple answer like Because the bible said so or because my mother told me it was. Its not so much that I believe that its wrong.  Its that Im a fiercely loyal person and this feels...  guilty.  Good old RC guilt.  But talking about it is a good way to cope.  ,Wicca,ddtw8tw,1,t5_2rgn5

And you could emphasise that its about connecting with nature and uncovering practices of our ancestors who were far more in tune with nature than we are nowadays in a lot of ways the wheel of the year. The wheel of the year is like a calendar for long term personal growth that fits in with the seasons and the lunar cycles are like for short term growth or short term goals in your life.

11437505,0,t3_6337rc,Most wiccan have personal beliefs especially with that path they walk. I myself include spirit animals into my path because I think they give a relative meaning tothings especially since I am close to all animals and have a soft spot for those kinds of things. I meditated and tried to study a lot about them and was almost sure I knew what mine was but one day I did have a dream showing me something else. It wasnt just a dream but a glimpse into my souls right down tomy spirit animal. I saw them fullyand was a baby one myself in the vision they were leading me to great things even though I didnt know what or where but I knewi had to follow them and that I couldnt stop. They protected me. That is how I found that my spirit animal is a whale.,Wicca,dfsfhx3,2,t5_2rgn5
11545997,0,t1_dg4pk82,She wasnt necessarily pushed by her friend... she kind of just did it. But she asked her friend right after contact is cut off Coven member has to sneak and see the girl at  AM to talk and she supported it. We already started making some rules and she basically said I dont have any in mind you guys can make whatever you want. At this point the coven has really just been us three practicing together with common interests spiritually and not. Shes very laid back and is good at problem solving but often forgets the part about consequences. Its difficult but shes very accepting so Im sure we can work something out. Im the kind of person that doesnt really like to hurt feelings so if she did something that truly made me think she needed to be expelled from the coven itd be very difficult. ,Wicca,dg4qop9,1,t5_2rgn5
