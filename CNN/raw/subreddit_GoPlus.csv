9188390,0,t3_563r4r,Yes. Sometimes the red line will point to the pokemon go is trying to catch but sometimes ive noticed the go will target a pokemon that is visible on the screen.,GoPlus,d8gp26n,1,t5_3gcxz
9764971,0,t1_dagqhtl,Ive been doing that pretty often with no results. Ive gone back to manually catching and wow did I get spoiled by the GoPlus!,GoPlus,dagr02e,2,t5_3gcxz
9900337,0,t3_5fa9u0,Pro You can use it while driving.Con Good luck on it actually detecting anything while driving and being able to hit it in time you really need to line it stops on the phone and hit them the second you can.Pro You can catch one Pokemon with the Plus while catching a different one manually.Con Good luck on it ever detecting Pokemon while looking at them or staying connected long enough for that to happen Some days it works really well some days it disconnects every  minutes.Pro It can be awesome for hatching eggs.Con But it will vibrate whenever a random Pokemon comes along even when you have no balls to catch it then even hitting the button doesnt dismiss the notification and you have to just straight up wait till the Pokemon despawns for it to stop vibratingflashing you might want to put it in a sock or something over night.I cant decide if its more enjoyable than it is frustrating..?Honestly getting a screenturnoffapp is way better than the plus it hatches eggs vibratesmakes noise when a Pkm is near and you can just catch them regular style which means you wont be A Wasting Pokeballs on trash and B Not using Ultraballs on awesome Pokemon.But I feel obligated to use it since I spent like  bucks or so on it D,GoPlus,day1c8n,2,t5_3gcxz

11305896,0,t3_61coju,if you didnt get it from an official distributor its probably a fake. there were high quality fakes on the market literally the first week they were available so i expect any second party distributors to be selling them.,GoPlus,dfdi8nf,3,t5_3gcxz
11489989,0,t3_63zoaf,I bought mine yesterday and im experiencing this too.Sometimes it will buzz sometimes it wont just blink the lights.When I play the button the white light buzz thing doesnt work either but the game says its connected.,GoPlus,dfye0e9,1,t5_3gcxz
