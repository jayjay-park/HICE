3542724,0,t3_30smy3,Youre doing the right thing asking for recommendations  there are an awful lot of muppets out there calling themselves pros.  We used Garry Walls for ours eight years ago  hes an affordable photographer and he and his wife did the photography and music for our small wedding. We didnt pay a lot I think it was about a grand all up and while our photos werent amazing we feel we got really good value.The one thing I can recommend is to stay within your budget.  If youre well off spend up but if moneys tight dont stretch on the photog or ANY part of your wedding.  We kept ours pretty tight opting to spend the dough on an awesome honeymoon instead Disneyland FTW.  Eight very happy years later in which we have looked at the photos maybe twice were sure we made the right choice.,chch,cpw3d69,1,t5_2sbpq

Do not hop the fence and give yourself a drunken midnight tour youre just creating work for those people volunteering to monitor the security alarms.

Not sure if its still there or unoccupied at this point as it was a few years since I was there.Maybe hit up the RATS and see if you can tag along as they go though abandoned buildings sometimes. If you were willing to go a bit further out of town old mines are generally a good source of abandoned stuff there are some out by Coalgate.     ,chch,d48dip9,3,t5_2sbpq
