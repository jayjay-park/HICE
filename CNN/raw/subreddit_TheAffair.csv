5562791,0,t3_3qflup,I dont know what it says about my own biases but I trust Noahs the least. Hes a selfabsorbed prick who whitewashes his own memories to make himself out to be some great guy in a totally douche way.Everyone elses I take with a grain of salt but look at them as truthful but colored by their own emotions. Allison is colored by grief and transformation. Helen is plainly hurt. And Cole is flawed but has a kind heart and has not stopped loving his wife.,TheAffair,cwmm4yw,4,t5_2ybup

5877815,0,t1_cxpy1id,Allisons feelings are all over the place. I dont think she even knows what she wants in life. I was surprised she seemed somewhat jealous when Noah stopped having sex with her to praise Joni for finally saying da da,TheAffair,cxq43fh,3,t5_2ybup
5939968,1,t3_3wq5o0,Wait Scottys secret partner is ColeLuisa and hes trying to get Alison to buy in.Edit nm. It was actually in chronological order! Ali bought in with Cole for Luisa Scotty got cut in for agreeing to go to detox ...and Cole still doesnt know that Joanie might be his baby.Seriously half the town knows and Cole is like What was the secret Scotty? I dont get it. Derp. LMAO! Buy a clue Cole!,TheAffair,cxy9ddq,1,t5_2ybup
5942099,0,t1_cxyeg11,A lot of time has passed between the affair and the trial. Not hard to imagine that Cole has moved on and cant really be bothered to have anything but indifference towards Noah.,TheAffair,cxyjf41,5,t5_2ybup

10552680,0,t3_5r2123,Im not sure where you can go from here without completely abandoning previous storylines. Im not sure if Ill watch the next season but if its Noahcentric Ill absolutely bail. Honestly it feels like this show has run its course especially with the direction the writers decided to go in this season. Im really not sure how theyre going to come back from Noah completely losing his mind and the hyperfocus on one character in what used to be an ensemble show. Maybe theyll do another time jump but part of what made the first two seasons so good was the tension surrounding the affair and then the murder. The further you get away from that the less interesting these characters become imo. ,TheAffair,dd49jvu,1,t5_2ybup
10558769,0,t1_dd3ej5t,I actually thought that response was really realistic given what she went through and how their relationship has been. I know Whitneys a brat but it may have felt too soon for her. ,TheAffair,dd4yf3o,13,t5_2ybup
10660394,0,t3_5rfz21,I saw a lot of comments that people  just didnt get about first Noah is hallucinating next hes in Paris supposedly better.  I compared it to watching a movie or reading a book.  One can never fit in ever moment of everyones life in a movie or TV series so some things need to be left to the imagination.  I predicted that Noah had to go to rehab as addicted as he was and there are a lot of transitions that Sarah Treem chose not to show us to me thats great.  Its left up to our own interpretation.  I was sure there would be a scene where Allison tells Cole the baby is his his reaction etc. but there wasnt.  But Noahs rehabilitation..we didnt see how much he suffered but he probably reached bottom and got help at the point we left him.,TheAffair,ddfjecd,1,t5_2ybup
