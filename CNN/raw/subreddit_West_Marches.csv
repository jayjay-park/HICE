11291713,0,t1_dfbvazf,Yeah my original rumor involved some people going into a cave in the Grasstides and never coming back. Still trying to find some info on this cave. Maybe it was the mine though.,West_Marches,dfbwe0s,1,t5_3j2zl
11291798,0,t3_615p3w,The adventure started with Kaleb gathering forces as I watched him from afar still lingering on the things that happened between us long ago something you dont need to know about so dont ask. When he finally had his team selected I turned up too. It seemed that he knew I was present he always did have eyes at his back the clever mug. Six strong with Andrea the town guard at our side who I convinced to come along by making her fear what that goblin was doing so close to town.When we finally arrived where the petrified goblin used to be we found nothing but tracks leading north making us think that this stonework was dragged by the other goblins or some other small critters. We turned out to be right.As we walked along side each other Kaleb and I relieved our fond memories about that time our swords clashed and fates intertwined. Our reunion was quickly interrupted by a patrol of goblins who were drenched in mud and riding lizard mounts big enough to be a threat themselves. One of our nave companions Duir decided that he could negotiate with these goblins Without knowing Goblin. The less the said the better. In any case once it became clear that they are not willing to negotiate I loosened an arrow into the furthers one hoping they would run in fear. Instead we were bloodied in battle and after a long minute our foes were on their knees or stomachs. We captured one of the goblins who in fear soiled himself. While he stank and it was unbearable to be around him MY negotiation tactics went much better as I wiggled the information out of our small friend. To Duirs credit he quickly realized that my way was working better and so he switched to my routine.We information extracted I tied an iron chain around the goblins hands that were already in manacles once again bought by me. KhemThe next set of problems were just around the hill however as we ambushed yet another patrol of goblins though they had something with them more powerful that the lizards before. A Guardrake. Foolishly I thought I could tame the beast. Said foolishness could have cost me my life but now its just bite marks to my side. Youd have to ask the others what happened next as I was on the ground dying. Andrea fell in battle after me and she did not make itBut I was not left on the ground to rot. The party survived and we started to make our final plan the assault on the Goblin encampment. We thinned out their numbers so the sneaking to their location was no problem. Delwyn Kaleb and I peppered the guards on duty with missles dropping them dead on the ground. Next we set up a trap I was making a ball of hay with  torches inside it while the others stuck javelins daggers and tiny iron balls into the opening of their lair. Our plan went swimmingly. Most of the assholes suffocated in minutes. One we had to take down with our weapons. After a ten or so minutes we saw smoke billowing out the other side of the lair about  feet away from us. We then ventured forth into that opening after the smoke cleared. Inside this cave we heard three voices. Voice of a large fuck ugly bugbear a small critter some spellcaster and you wont believe it The statue who was mocking both.The fight commenced it was long and hard but the bugbear and his lesser friend were defeated. I was pissed of at the screaming sculpture and decided that such a work of art was not in our interest. When I destroyed it however we discovered an opening where this creature was sitting. I call him Nil Nil say hi. Bye. Fuck you Nil.Anyway after a chat with Nil we realized he may be more useful alive than dead and so under my protection we brought him into town. And that was our day. Now can I please have some more ale?Edit How close I was to dying,West_Marches,dfbwqj6,7,t5_3j2zl

11483395,0,t3_63wv73,Well the first T.H.A.C.O. sponsored hunting was interesting to say the least. I oversaw a group recent arrivals to haven along with our newest and only nonorc T.H.A.C.O. member. Our Quarry were  dire wolves we caught their trail early on east of haven and began to follow it little did we know it would lead us into the northern forest. I was a little cautious at first I know the dangers that lie deep in the forest and worried for some of the groups less experienced members but we found out prey shortly after they split up.it seems the wolves were hunting their own prey lizardmen. We made quick work of the wolves but before we could begin collecting our spoils we were beset by lizardmen from the north east.  soldiers and their shaman. luckily we survived mostly thanks to the shaman running away. At the end of the battle Rinn Korshnir and one of the lizardmen lay unconscious. We stabilized all  and made our way back to haven lizard tied and gagged. We put the lizard in the haven stockades. Visit with it if you so desire but for the love of the gods dont let Rinn try to tame it.,West_Marches,dfxn2zy,3,t5_3j2zl

11542996,0,t1_dg48pf5,Those secrets you learned about the world are not accurate at all.This is one of the reasons why we established it was NOT canon.Those magical people you talked to should have never existed.On a further note when new players see this it implies to those I spoke with that we were not transparent about what happened.

11543195,0,t1_dg4d1l3,Im trying to keep all this system simple. I would see mining as more of a way of gaining funds and supporting the efforts of other trades like smithing. Yes it would include smelting.As for levels not to the level that you need X level to get a certain ore. Once we reach higher levels I will see what is working and update as needed.,West_Marches,dg4f8ba,1,t5_3j2zl

11582166,0,t1_dg8ptv4,I dont think attacking character archetypes is as important as explaining to the PLAYER that their character is secondary to group fun in other words you WILL break character at some points for the fun of the group.
