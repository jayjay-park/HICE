885905,0,t1_ch4z0wm,ok my advice stay away from CC because you have to allocate memory for nonprimitive data types this can range from nice if you are a veteran and control freak towards fucking pain in the ass. It is a source for many errors that leave memory leaks and usually show up later. Java does memory management for you ok it is possible to still fuck it up somehow but in comparison to CC it wont be a problem.Your experience with the JRE makes sense but you dont have to deal with multiple Java installs from different generations etc. You install the shit on your computer and it runs... I cant say that about my experience with CC on various platforms and library combinations. Although I must admit when I want to program I am not a very patient person then I want to code and not to setup.performance wise I wouldnt worry well except you are working on a FPS or any other highperformance game but since your experience is quite low I would advice to do some simple games first anyway.my advice get Java  Eclipse do some basic programming stuff get used to it and then use libgdx for game development. Also you dont have to worry about porting to LinuxMacWindows at all.an alternatively HaxeFlixel Flixel is a great library and Haxe makes it platform independent as far as I know. Flixel iswas a library game development in Flash ActionScript . I love it because it provides a lot of stuff out of box collision detection etc.  whereas libgdx is mostly only a framework.,roguelikedev,ch4zb78,2,t5_2si41

1751126,0,t1_cjzve9k,Yep very useful site for when you have a specific function and you just need a couple examples of how to use it! Google used to have a site like that but after they shut it down a year or two ago Ohloh seems like one of the best alternatives.Sadly on closer inspection it doesnt look like there are any libtcod callback examples using pathnewusingfunction. That Warden class doesnt use callbacks but it does let the pathfinder search for a path regardless of what monsters and other things are in the way based purely on the pathmap apparently then the AI applies conditions based on what happens to be in the next celli.e. it checks whether the cell is blocked and moves randomly if it is. Its not as powerful as a real callback but it will solve your current problem which is arising because youre actually changing the pathfinding map data itself. In your case the pathfinder will never find a path in many cases but with the Warden code the monster will always move in the right direction right up until its blocked then randomly shift around presumably waiting for the area to no longer be blocked.Happy to help.,roguelikedev,cjzvys3,2,t5_2si41

2718695,0,t3_2r6bk1,Ganymede GateHatin holidays hereDirectly from the Git log Added a safeguard to catch error starting the server console Provisioned the server with a stdin command to reload all cached files Added WebGL renderer to ASCIITerminal.js Added colormap to the client Added particle routes to the client Added the WebGL shaders to the client Provisioned the client to modify the WebGL shaders on the flyWhat does this mean for the average user?  The renderer is now BLAZINGLY fast like fps up from fps and the rendering code is much more clean no canvas tricks just a simple GLSL shader. The server is a little more stable making it easy for everyone to run one. Clients can change their colormap although this hasnt been provisioned yet so people with color perception trouble can finetune it to their like. Particles now fly over their route thanks to the extra speed of the terminal rendering. Users can modify WebGL shaders on the fly with a super secret keystroke ctrlshifts making it extremely easy to test out different shaders. Testing new clients is a lot faster now thanks to the capability to refresh all cached client files on the HTTP endpoint all files are served off from RAM.Later on i will make an ASCIITerminal.js release with the new WebGL renderer.

3326010,0,t3_2y8c1y,Id really like to see more roguelikes that experiment with squad systems. The single player character meme from the Berlin interpretation is so pointlessly restrictive.Sometimes squad games have a problem with managing complexity since having a squad multiplies the management required from the player for every system governing those characters. Abstraction gets more important as the player gets more things to manage.I like the singlecharacterwithfollowers idea since it can hopefully bypass the management issue. Instead of managing each avatar individually their AI manages them and you manage the AIs goals and disposition. This could make a really cool drl!Playing Combat Mission a lot recently one cool idea that you could borrow is the chain of command where orders require some plausible delivery method. In CM this means shouting distance or else using radios. But in a roguelike you could have many more communication factors possession magical dispatch characters that are lacking one or more senses orders with multiple potential interpretations etc.,roguelikedev,cp7e5ko,3,t5_2si41

4632439,0,t3_3ee3pr,I think good UI is of vital importance but it can also become a serious pain in the butt to work with and Ive had a few projects in the past which Ive lost interest in largely because I got bogged down wrestling with an unwieldy UI framework.  So Ive invested a lot of effort in making the process as painless as possible for myself by rolling my own GUI system heavily inspired by the good bits of WPFUI objects all inherit from a base class called GUIElement.  GUIElements are hosted on a layer and can also contain other GUIElements which are displayed on top of it  most GUIElements are actually nested inside other GUIElements in this way.  Every update an arrangement pass is done before the elements are drawn which is used to dynamically adjust their position and size.  As well as width and height properties each GUIElement has widthLogic and heightLogic properties which determine how this arrangement is done and has three possible valuesFIXED  the specified widthheight of the element is used directlyAUTO  the widthheight of the element is adjusted to fit its contentsFILL  the widthheight of the element is adjusted to fill its container or the whole screen if it doesnt have one.  If several elements are trying to fill the same space then they are assigned a proportion of the available dimension weighted by their specified widthheight values.I currently have over  different GUI subclasses including standard things like buttons textboxes scrollbars and the like but also including some invisible element types which are simply there to arrange their contents in different ways  for example GUIStackPanel lines its contents up either vertically or horizontally GUIGrid arranges everything in columns and rows each of which can have its own logic type as described above and so on.  I also have a few nonstandard types of UI element made up of combinations of different subelements such as Zeldaheartsstyle icon bars images which can fill up based on a bound value used in Hellion to represent item cooldowns and so on.Elements are responsible for their own rendering although this is usually actually handled by an artist subobject which can be swapped out to give different effects. For example most elements have a default border style which is rendered as a bunch of tris with different vertex colours as seen in DArrrLs UI but that can easily be overriden with a bitmap as in Hellions UIThe end result allows me to define and tweak UI very easily without having to worry about the setout too much I just define the layout logic and the arrangement system does the rest and gives me a lot of flexibility over how I want to display things.  If I want a button with some text on it I can do that if I want to have a button with an image on it I can do that if I want to abandon any pretence of sanity and have a button with a button on it I can do that too.,roguelikedev,ctehla7,5,t5_2si41

Big thanks to everyone for making this community what it is today!For my part everywhere I go which is everywhere theres talk about roguelike development p Ive also been inviting new members to our humble sub. Perhaps because of my active role over time Ive also gotten a number of PMs about changes or improvements people would like to see assuming I was a mod and could help with that. Well now Im actually a mod and can do that stuff D. So dont hesitate to ask if theres something you need or some way we could improve the sub.Ill be making changes gradually as I get around to them. The most important will be rebuilding our sidebar with more relevant info and keeping it up to date. I also have ideas for some useful resources we could create together and add. The other most obvious coming change will be a nice header image and swapping out our default style for a more readable one an older version of rnaut which anyone who doesnt want can simply disable.In the words of uFritzy putting words in my mouth I am your king.And yeah robotic overlord too uthebracket P,roguelikedev,cwr1003,12,t5_2si41

You can mod algorithm as I did allowing only creation of map up to certain depth which will greatly improve speed. For example if your enemies will go aggressive on distance of  squares create Dijkstra map to depth . If you need on rare occasions to have map on greater range say you have  enemy which need to come closer to inspect player create greater map once every  turns store it for his use and move enemy downhill  squares and recalculate.,roguelikedev,cx019y0,3,t5_2si41

5914904,0,t3_3wb1uo,For Golden Krone Hotel the most interesting thing Im doing is desaturating tiles that are out of the field of view. I went back and forth on how to display previously seen tiles. Blue tinted? Black? Desaturated seems like the best approach but it does mean all tiles need to be really colorful to start with.More interesting is color in Dumuzid Since Dumuzid lacks any sort of HUD or ingame menu color is a pretty important visual marker. All enemies have the same behavior so to distinguish them I just use random colors. Each enemy has a slight gradient to make them look less flat. The player however is black which for some reason feels really appropriate. Color helps to distinguish the different kinds of spells even before theyre identified unidentified spells have a circle shape and change to distinctive shape after being used for the first time. Unexplored areas are white which looks quite distinct from most RLs. Tiles are light grey and unseen tiles are simply darker greys which lets the enemies pop a bit more.,roguelikedev,cxuz57b,5,t5_2si41
5981011,0,t3_3xddgb,Black FutureAs usual my github is Its been a good week in BFland. Ive mainlined the majority of my experimental branch and am mostly happy with the results. Ive still got a bit of tweaking to do to finish applying it but its definitely been worth it.The biggest change is that the world is now real D using a voxelbased layering system. This actually simplified a lot of things there was a lot of effort going into faking a D appearance before and its easier being able to just use a regionxyz coordinate system everywhere. It made some of the lineofsight code MUCH simpler.On the backend worldgen plays a little movie sped up version   while it runs. It still takes longer than Id like but its generating x scalable to x world tiles of xx voxels  so theres a lot to do. It does produce a completely seamless world the tiles line up perfectly. Theres still some bugs with an integer overflow in there but its nearly done. The world is broken into biomes categorized by altitude temperature and a difficulty quotient that is a function of how far away you are from the initial crash zone. Eventually the game will have settlers exploring the world  hence the big world! I also integrated the zip stream functionality from POCO reducing the size of the whole world to  Mb on disk.The renderer is back to ASCIIonly while I get the kinks worked out. Ill do graphics later I have some fun ideas for that. Ive got heightbased shading working and camera navigation with arrow keys and greaterthanlessthan for updown. Here is a D terrain view a desertgrass intersection   and here is a timelapse of moving the camera upwards Having to work with volume in worldgen made shipbuilding a little more tricky Heres the escape pods three layers  . Fieldofview works in true D with revealed but not visible areas going to grey. Heres an example FOV  .So next up slowly due to Christmas and travel commitments fixing movementpathing getting the mouseUI into a friendly shape and Ill be back to where I was in terms of funcitonality  but in D!

DAnyway where was I?DemonCurrent PC Mac and Linux builds new as of  DownloadDevblog demon.ferretdev.orgFinally getting close to wrapping up the first content build in a long long while.  I posted this a few places earlier this week but the art is  complete D Heres the characters both the originals and the Geminimax sets and the ability icons. Hooray ArtThe new abilities some of them quite interesting and usual are also all implemented and working. D Heres a sampling of the new goodies summoners can look forward to using... if they can talk the appropriate demons into joining them to give lessons first. DBask Fire Must target an enemy with Ignite status. No effect on the target but the user receives a  Power heal and  SP. This ability does not take time to execute. Cooldown Type Cantrip  turnsFan Flames Fire Must target an enemy with Ignite status.  Power attack has a  chance to cause Ignite for an unusually long duration causing damage over time to the target. Notable among Fire attacks in that it does not require a clear line of fire only line of sight.Emit Sparks Electricity Targets  randomly selected enemies in range.  Power attack  chance to cause Shock which causes the targets to lose their next turn. Has a flat chance to hit or miss that is not influenced by Agility.Galvanize Electricity Passive. Regain  SP when you inflict Shock status on a character.Light Dart Light  Power attack. Passes harmlessly through friendly and neutral targets.Twilight None Passive. When your HP are  or less of maximum Light and Dark abilities cost  SP less to use and no longer trigger or use Light and Dark cooldowns.The characters implementation is in progress but nearing completion. After that the only thing left is coding up the new still admittingly basic level generation algorithm I want to use for Anomaly levels so that they feel different and then some testing to make sure it all works properly.

6437878,0,t1_czjg9ws,Brogue has no experience points. I guess that design decision was motivated by wanting to avoid the situation where the player must hunt down and kill every easy monster on the level because its tactically beneficial to get the points as in DCSS.So yes it refocuses the player on the goal of getting Yendor by whatever imaginative means rather than by grinding. I dont agree that removing the XP game mechanic increases the players odds of surviving. If I was getting experience points in Brogue that made my character tougher the middle levels would be really easy  unless the monsters were also made tougher to balance that out  which would make seeking out every available lowlevel kill even more of a necessity.It might also tempt me into taking unwise risks lured by the promise of points so in that respect yes. But all that happens without XP is that you dont get a supertough character and have plenty of other unwise and potentially fatal things available to do instead of initiating attacks on fierce monsters.The question here seems to be how do you stop fools rushing in to fight an ogre? and the answer is you cant theyre fools thats the sort of thing they do. Whats often happening with a noob player is that they expect the game to be relatively forgiving and for the actual problem situation to become apparent after a bit of careless buttonbashing. If all theyve learned how to do is move around and bumpkill things they do that to everything waiting for the game to tell them what to do next which it wont because its a roguelike.Possible solution have the monsters give warnings. If it was a fullon firstperson graphical game like a survival horror or something youd get scarylooking monsters being obviously threatening and a series of hints about what youre supposed to do delivered in text form. Roguelikes cant do the graphics but they can still do the text you can have things like WARNING! There is an ogre on this level! and then The ogre appears! Beware! or Bones crunch underfoot. You see a trail of blood leading to the east. or The ogre bellows FE FI FO FUM and rushes towards you but stumbles! Now is your chance to escape! delivered as messages in a dialogbox like system that interrupts play ... if being noobfriendly was a design goal.DCSS does say things a bit like that if I remember rightly  you get messages when you see a unique without having to actually examine the monster first  but like every other roguelike it puts them in the message list which noobs just dont read.,roguelikedev,czl7r3k,2,t5_2si41

6561026,0,t3_45ho5d,Golden Krone HotelI fixed one of the biggest annoyances in the game! GKH has a unique problem because of the vampirehuman duality. It causes a lot of backtracking because of enemies you cant kill and books you cant read as vampire. The enemy part has been improved since I now show all previously seen enemies on the map and am thinking I should go even further and perhaps have an atlas of how many enemies are on each floor. But the book handling was still a huge pain. My solution is that any books you try to read as a vampire get stored on your character an icon is displayed showing the number youre carrying and you automatically read them as soon as you turn back into a human. I chose this approach versus alternatives like adding books to the inventory because I want that part of the game really streamlined.Performance has been a big issue in the past and though Ive come a long way I was thinking this week about what else could be done. Im constantly wondering if I rewrote the entire display system in Pixi.js if that would fix things. Currently only part of it is handled by Pixi. The amount of effort is intimidating and everytime I start converting over some code it seems like Pixi is slower at each step compared to using straight up canvas rendering. For instance I tried to replace the desaturating effect with a Pixi filter and it was waaaay slow. Anyway while going down this road I found some other performance wins such as drawing previously seen tiles less often and skipping some draw steps in certain cases.One fun tangent came out of me looking at Pixi again is that Pixi filters are really cool. I found one that easily converts objects e.g. the entire screen to ASCII displayASCII FilterOf course I would probably implement ASCII mode by hand. Still cool though!I played around with the idea of secret doors. Im not sure if this is something I want to put in the game but I did figure out that implementing it is super easy! Surprisingly all I need to do is make doors have a wall sprite for a basic secret door. Ill have to think on that some.

Like light sources in Angband a big inspiration for me torches determine line of sight and have a specific range as well as gradually losing power until they run out completely leaving you with a line of sight range of  square.Currently levels are either entirely dark requiring a torch or entirely lit with a  chance of each but next week Im planning to experiment with partially lit levels to see how that works.Part of the reason the minor updates were required was that I discovered a bug with the version of Unity Id been using that meant changing screen resolutions between play sessions made playing in full screen mode impossible not a major bug I guess but it annoyed me. I tried upgrading to a later version of Unity but that actually caused further problems  I dont know how people put up with Unity ! I eventually had to fully get to grips with the unity Screen and Resolution classes and the way Unity processes its resolution build settings to sort out the problem.

7435458,0,t3_4h28uu,Black Future  Github | WebsiteWork continues apace on getting the game running on the new engine RLTK. Worldgen is done enough to continue theres always more to improve there and so the basic game mode and task of converting components systems and entities over to the new ECS has begun. Im taking advantage of the partial rewrite to clean up a bunch of things. So far its going great the basic game mode is very fast now albeit still missing some things such as settlers accomplishing anything. Added additional commentary during worldgen so you dont feel like it has locked up. Biomes have gained a lot more detail. The worldbuilder successfully saves initial game state. Compressed saves. Theres a lot of redundant information so one region file went from  Mb to about k! Got basic play the game mode going again. You can view the map scroll around it in  dimensions. Its so fast I had to add a keyboard delay a nice problem to have. Added the calendarclock back in. Started moving some of the worldgen specific definitions such as rocks grass etc. out into text files that are loaded on startup making it easier to adjust how the world works. Started porting the raws reader system improving it substantially in the process.RLTK  The Roguelike Toolkit in C GithubWere still very focused on features that fit my game rather than generic framework work. The biggie is adding a serialization framework to the ECS to make game saveload easier. Saving is easy  it saves all entities and then iterates all components calling a save function in each entity. Entities do have to define a type unique ID but that  and save  are the only requirements. Loading is accomplished by providing a callback that knows how to map type IDs to class creation and calls the load function. That way the Entity Component System in RLTK doesnt have to know anything about your structures  but can still offer a lot of serialization assistance.In other news its bring the baby to the office morning  so a happy baby is playing in her bouncer while I write this up. ,roguelikedev,d2nd43g,3,t5_2si41

7617438,0,t3_4jldh6,I think a problem is if you are trying to force too many systems into a singular model.For example Input handling works really well as a stack based system. When you open a dialog activate an ability look around etc. you push a new input handling state onto your stack that lets you properly handle all user input. Then when you resolve the action close the dialog or what have you you pop that state off and you know that under it is the proper input handling state for your game state.For example heres our input stack through a sample in game example    Stack BaseCharacterActions Right most is on top        User presses look button    Stack BaseCharacterAction LookAction    character presses enter for more information about their tile    Stack BaseCharacterAction LookInputAction ClosableDialogActions    character hits enter to close additional information dialog    Stack BaseCharacterAction LookInputAction    Character stops looking around    Stack BaseCharacterActionThe system has the ability to be very flexible as it supports all sorts of input handling quirks and situations. But such an implementation doesnt necessarily make sense for each component of your overall system. The best bet is to divide up concerns Input and Displaying a Menu are two different concerns that shouldnt depend on each other and build out the proper system for each and have them communicate only over a well defined API.,roguelikedev,d382a76,1,t5_2si41

8067629,0,t1_d4ms0ep,Good arguments. I have to admit making X happen with probability P wasnt part of my initial thought. I added that in because looking at Nethack it uses the technique heavily even in some of the mechanics that got me thinking along these lines. What you say about adding no additional state to the game is very much along the lines Ive been thinking.gt You seem to prefer randomization to magnitude. Being noisy is already a state that has to be tracked if noise is in the game. I dont think making noise a boolean state with a probability of happening makes it a micromechanic. In fact Id say having a noise magnitude which equals the distance you can be heard is the simpler noise mechanic.Thats a good point about distance. I think thats a very micro way to go about it as well as being physically realistic. The main reason I used randomization instead of varying distance is because a radius didnt occur to me at the time rather than out of any allergy to magnitude. I dont particularly like mechanics that involve the player figuring a radius on the grid because I find it hard to do but that doesnt have any bearing on microness.What I would say has bearing on it is discrete categories vs. numeric ones. The condition is present or it isnt an event happened or it didnt you made noise or you didnt. Now unlike figuring distances I dont have anything against numerical quantities but I see them as beefing up a mechanic. Now you cant assign a probability to an event without numerical quantities so are randomized mechanics less micro than deterministic ones? I dont know maybe. All numbers are less than  at least. But I see determinism and microness as separate qualities.I dont really understand what you mean about noisy being a state that has to be tracked. The way I was thinking was that when a noise was made the rule for noises sent some kind of alert to nearby mobs not necessarily a noisespecific one if mobs have no noisespecific code. So its not a state just an event.gt Id disagree with you that probability is a simpler mechanic than cool down. Some of the same arguments as before magnitude vs boolean. I would say ditching a movement stat and having abilities that let you move twice move three times move diagonally would be more reductionary presuming you have an ability system.Its not really simplicity that I have in mind. Its more about selfcontainedness I think the ability to be implemented without knowledge of other mechanics or other mechanics having knowledge of it. But it is also about definition size otherwise each mechanic could get its own copy of everything and thats not really in the spirit of the concept. Thats why I said cooldowns are not micro because either youve got a cooldown system the mechanic is connected to or youve got a cooldown system built into the mechanic making it pretty big considering what it does. If it was a board game I couldnt really just throw cooldowns at the players Id have to give them some help with multiturn tracking. On the other hand I can say flip a coin or roll a die all I want. I can throw that rule at chess and make kings minutely slower than other pieces. All that being said if cooldowns arent micro theyre close. Its not out of the question to bundle one inside a mechanic.,roguelikedev,d4mvm18,2,t5_2si41

The D system is robust enough to implement complex animations particle effects etc. I dont know how Unreal handles D.You seem to be concerned with PCG specifically. PCG doesnt depend on the engine so much. You have to write your own algorithms regardless of engine at that point its more about your preferred language.

8807888,0,t3_50qbig,I did some profiling recently and it turns out that the main bottleneck is the system that synchronizes animations. Now thats certainly an unoptimized mess but its something that runs once or twice per turn and shouldnt be having that much of an impact! Thatll need investigation.AI pathfinding doesnt take that much time actually. Not really surprising since when enemies are not chasing the player or each other they just wander around. But I suspect itll increase a bit when I add patrolling enemies.  FOV is not an issue either. Each creature just checks for line of sight with nearby enemies or allies so the full FOV is only used for the player. The game maintains an opacity map of the current level so the FOV just needs to be recalculated whenever a point inside the FOV changes opacity or when the player moves of course.Because the world is infinite saving could become a bottleneck until recently. Now the game just saves the current world chunk so thats no longer an issue. Saving occurs every turn in its own thread parallel with the animations. Since animations do not change the game state that works nicely.,roguelikedev,d76l6pr,2,t5_2si41

Rather than storing both entity peopleanimals and map information in one structure you store the map data in array form and instead keep a container of entities which have a position property.In this latter format what you would do is store the map as you are doing but for the highly dynamic entities you would just store the entire entity structure and apply that to the map when you regenerate it.,roguelikedev,d8qhhsg,6,t5_2si41

10323951,0,t1_dcdsu0j,I am developing an open world roguelike using Unity.In short my approach is to make everything I can NOT dependent on Unity game objects or the Unity SDK. So the only active game objects in my game are the currently visible tilescell elements in the game area and the UI elements. Everything else is custom C code. That way I can switch to any other game engine that supports C without having to rewrite the whole game.My world map is made of x cells of x cells each x and can seamlessly load and generate local map chunks when the player is moving without any noticeable performance hit. I could make the map even bigger and it wouldnt impact the performance. So there isnt a map size limit per se with Unity you just have to design your engine appropriately if you want to make an open world game. However its a LOT harder than dealing with restricted area maps and I wouldnt recommend doing this if you dont know what youre getting into.Im guessing CoQ has a similar approach i.e. not depending on game objects except for displaying tiles although it works by loading chunks only when you reach the edge of other chunks my game has the player always centered on screen.The only thing that is problematic for me in Unity is lighting performance. Its really really bad when you have multiple light sources casting shadows. I cant bake the lighting because the game is dynamic and doesnt use Unity prefabs at all. Im pretty sure Unreal Engine could deal with this a lot better.,roguelikedev,dce9z3w,2,t5_2si41
10326258,0,t3_5nuahe,AxuDownload ..cUpcoming changelogAnother notsobusy week on development. Finding it a bit hard to collect myself enough to do any serious work on Axu. I did manage to finish creating a spawn event system for quests which gives more power to myself and modders. NPCs and Objects can be placed in specific areas during particular events in a quest OnStart OnComplete OnFail and OnCompleteStep. I hope to include other functionality like giving the player particular skills or traits upon completion. Events like these can be expanded upon and used like components. Imagine being able to make a weapon that holds an event to summon friendlies upon landing a critical hit or a firearm that explodes its previous shots upon being reloaded. Im quite excited to begin replacing my generic enums with events like these. On a more QoL note you can now throw items by pressing the t key default and select an item. This is just another way to access the same action rather than opening the inventory selecting the item then selecting Throw. Im all for reducing the number of hot keys needed but this seemed like a necessary addition.  ,roguelikedev,dcejeln,6,t5_2si41

10519223,0,t1_dd0glqv,... And now Im doing what uKyzrati does comment on my own post because it was so long.My games seem to be languishing in the tech demo area but I dont mind. The Unreal Engine project was supposed to be a tech demo either way. As for Veins well at first it was supposed to be a small game showcasing how to do d mechanics in LuaTEngine but it grew. Then the goal was to port Incursion or most of it then I put my own spin on things... The TEngine version has more content than Incursion when it comes to number of zones and possibly more items but less featsspells. The LOVE version is a glorified tech demo so far mostly because it needs more love when it comes to level generation. Im thinking Ill focus on getting the basic featsspells code out there first then port the content and then start worrying about level generation. Ive been researching level generation and I think the best way to speed up level generation getting up to speed would be to use seeds but I dont know how to implement those PNote the author regrets nothing. The move to LOVED was a wonderful learning experience plus it allowed me to avoid some of the issues TEngine was causing giving me a random monster because the filters returned nil is NOT kosher!!! the filters were there for a reason! Plus Ill be able to implement Adam Milazzos FOV algorithm when I actually get around to it. Or any other thing I wish provided I can implement itfind a Lua lib for it.,roguelikedev,dd0gufn,2,t5_2si41
10526703,0,t1_dd1abrq,Ive absolutely fallen back into my old ways.  Part of this though is the knowledge that despite all that Ive done there are vast gaps and the games very much an alpha.This is probably most evident in the world map.  There are villages  theyre basically placeholders and uninteresting.  Theyre pretty much contentfree.  The set maps are more numerous and interesting but kind of scattershot all over the world.  Skills are less unimplemented than a year ago but many remain so.  A majority of the classes remain only a collection of skills and statistics.  One of the criticisms I read online and which is quite valid is that its a large open world with not enough to do.  Guilty.Because of this it feels almost dishonest to promote the game too much especially when one of my earliest large goals was to create a major roguelike in the largest most ambitious definition.  This has not happened yet and the most positive thing I could say was that it wont happen for a while yet.Thats not to say that Im unhappy with how things have gone.  Im actually beyond thrilled.  At the most basic level Ive worked on a roguelike that is  under my own control for five and a half years.  Im sure others will find fault with my code but by and large I find it pretty readable and rarely stumble over adding new features.  The games winnable.  Theres an optional superboss that several players have told me they try to plan melee builds for.  People play it tell me about how some things work and dont and contribute bug reports.  I had someone contribute a full Russian translation earlier in the year.  And deep within the game in a place few people will visit is a large inprogress epic in the Spenserian tradition.  I shouldnt be so proud of the last item but it really has been fun to work on not to mention excellent procrastination for working on outofgame poetry.So Im torn.  I want to promote the game more post more screenshots etc. but it doesnt yet feel like Im at the point where I should be doing so.  Im keenly aware that others who can devote themselves to fulltime dev are doing more and faster.  But Im also starting to tackle more of the things that will make SotW feel like more of a complete game.

10543254,0,t1_dd203am,Ive done something similar but I did a NPC controller for every NPC type.  It essentially loops through all the entities that share a similar behavior and plans out their next few  actions based on that behavior That is unless of course anything significant has changed in the last turn.  ie player came into view... took damage.. or found something interesting   If not then great.. no need to move off course.  If so.. then just run them through the group behavior again.  This of course relies on the NPC keeping a cache of the next N moves....Its a bit overhead as compared to not doing it... but most of the time as in like... most of the time the NPCs actions are not going to be affected by the players actions.

10805513,0,t3_5uilwc,gt I think Cogmind will quickly become the standard to which other scifi roguelikes will be compared to. I find that intimidating. Way back when I started on my game I considered doing a postapocalyptic game but then decided it was a bad idea since CDDA clearly dominates the genre and I didnt think I could do the genre justice in the shadows of that classic. Instead I chose scifi because it has always seemed underrepresented to me other than perhaps FTL and games I consider roguelites rather than roguelikes. Well I think the sci fi standard bearer has arrived.Its a problem that RL players and devs even think along these lines. Other genres have measuring sticks to be sure but the RL genre has always been plagued by arbitrary standards and many RL games are plagued by adherence to or avoidance of these standards.The only reason your game would exist in the shadow of an oldmodern classic like CDDACogmind is because youre putting these games up on pedestals. Are they good RLs? Sure. Are theyon statistical expectationlikely to be better than your first game? Maybe. However theres no rankable quality metric that could lead anyone to say Cogmind is strictly better than uChazBass s SciFi Roguelike.I think youre still in honeymoon with Cogmind but can you pinpoint anything you would do differently? For example Cogmind takes a two steps forward two steps back approach to character development its hard to keep your equipment set intact for more than a few floors. Some even think this is a point of weakness for the game. Maybe again for example character development in your game is more conventionally stable and lets players continually build on their character.,roguelikedev,dduigre,5,t5_2si41

10863960,0,t3_5v72e2,Some games use hints that pop up in appropriate situations. I think this can be nice if its not too intrusive. But its annoying to constantly get walls of text thrown on you so such hints should be kept short and not too frequent.In my own project I did write a tiny manual a while back but now Im focusing on weaving as much teaching as possible into the game itself the epitome example of this principle being the famous opening of Super Mario Bros. The ideal is something you can just start playing which is fun from the getgo and seamlessly teaching you techniques as you go along. RLs are special I guess in that theres such a thing as learning by dying. Some players might be put off of this and we all know the frustration at losing your best character yet to some new and dangerous location but thats just part of the genre as far as I am concerned. I wouldnt mind a RL tutorial that instructs you to attack a bear which then proceeds to shred you to pieces As one example of my crude and baroque attempt to integrate tutorial content my game has judges who give rewards for the heads of criminals and hint about this in their dialogue. A judge shouting Yknow there are bounties on the heads of criminals is intended as a hint to new players without vexing veterans hopefully even adding to the atmosphere. If you try to offer a whole corpse the judge gives you a tool for decapitation and says Just bring the head next time. For teaching mechanics related to giving in general Im currently implementing a beggar type who will appear in many starting settlements. The beggar will still have other things going quest info or similar to remain interesting even after you know all about giving stuff to NPCs.Further down the road I might make tutorial scenarios for teaching specific stuff Like if your character works for a mining company there could be a foreman instructing you how to use dynamite. Again in later playthroughs you can just skip the mining company or do something like blowing up the foreman instead and see where the game goes from there. I guess the point is to split the tutorial up in smaller chunks that can be fun in themselves while not taking away the players freedom. I always hated long tutorials where you are forced to do stuff like walk to the marked spot to show your understanding of the arrow keys. Regarding manuals I personally find they can be quite cool even though you have to assume it will be read by  of your players. ADOMs manual for instance is almost worth reading even if youre not going to play. A nice document explaining the rules mixing in some lore and general hints is something Id definitely like to make at one point. It should be included as a pdf and viewable ingame.,roguelikedev,de0jh5e,1,t5_2si41

11029675,0,t3_5xe043,XenomarineLatest release Demo version .. on  February  After the last release Ive been thinking about what to work on next and Ive decided to do some fairly major improvements to the map design algorithms including another iteration of purely graphical improvements before releasing the Alpha which will hopefully be the next release in a couple of months. The plan is over the next few weeks to add at least  increase in room layout prefabs whole new range of XXL vault rooms new sprites for some key level features e.g. crates chests terminals multiple stylistic variants on room layouts  new purely decorative map itemsfloor designsIve already made a good start working on a number of the above more or less simultaneously but as very little is finished yet I will wait till later before I show off screenshots.So for now just a little thing I can show New scanner animation in which you can also see some of the new crate sprites,roguelikedev,dei6stq,3,t5_2si41
11100062,0,t1_depbhl6,Also you could try BearLibTerminal It have some quirks strange argument passing and its just and only for display handling but its great library. Working with unusual fonts bitmaps true type fonts etc. is really easy. In terms of display handling its imo ofc much better than libtcod. Altought BLT lacks of other features like FOV algorithms pathfinding etc. If I were you Id start with both BLT graphics and libtcod other roguelikespecific stuff.,roguelikedev,deq6krs,4,t5_2si41
11106131,0,t3_5ye2vm,Arkham After MidnightWell its going pretty well.  I have a workable engine.  What it needs now is more content.The idea of the game is that its a Lovecraftian investigation ala Call of Cthulhu so it combines traditional roguelike controls and gameplay but instead of the procedural generation creating the terrain it procedurally generates the story.  Essentially it assembles a story together out of a series of premade geomorphs that can be mixandmatched to hopefully make a cohesive story that is fun to work through or at least provides a lot of flavor but is still a bit unpredictable.  It should generate a mystery that is solvable has interesting parts that build on earlier parts and includes a few red herrings.Right now Im working on building those geomorphs.  Ive got several but its going to need a lot more to really leverage the idea of the procedural story creation.  Im not sure I will have the time to get it done in the days I have left but Im hoping to get it to the point where you can at least get one good mystery out of it.  So far I have a library a historical society a harbor a graveyard an old tomb a circle of stones an underwater city a mysterious ship some catacombs under the graveyard and some other elements.  Ill need a lot more to get it to the point I envisioned though.Its an experiment.  I had a pretty good idea of how it could work going into it and it promptly fell apart and had to be reengineered a few times before I got it to where I wanted it.  Now it is working pretty well but I lost a lot of time spinning my wheels with it even with bringing in a lot of boilerplate code from other roguelikes and other projects Ive worked on before.One thing Im quite happy with is the look of the game.  The tileset is inspired by the old Ultima games with heavy use of black and its turning out to be really attractive at least to me! and it seems to work well with the theme since its a darker tileset than you might otherwise see.  Im also finding it quite easy to extend with new sprites which is really helping with the content generation.,roguelikedev,deqvcep,4,t5_2si41
11109129,0,t1_deqsop0,Thanks for the feedback! Looking forward to hearing more.,roguelikedev,der7kpx,1,t5_2si41
11168978,0,t1_dexzj8i,Even just a few weeks back I was looking for more references for someone interested in what was possible in this style and was sad to see youd removed some of the old gifs from your site But at least your video was still around so I pointed them to that.Most recently I thought of your project yet again! when this thread popped up today. Not that youre doing multicharacter parties but cyberpunk!,roguelikedev,dexzptj,1,t5_2si41
11195028,0,t1_df0xv5r,That is a good idea. I need to look into it. I must admit I just started learning java because of college so this very much just a surface level recoding from a different language.,roguelikedev,df0xyj1,1,t5_2si41
11200352,0,t1_df133cv,Thanks. I know how to do the multiplayer part consider this done.  I use a pp solution for this plus a backend server for storage of player data.,roguelikedev,df1jo32,1,t5_2si41
11212848,0,t3_5zzy80,I found the RogueSharp tutorials really helpful when I was starting out. I was already familiar with C but new to roguelikes. Anyway a lot of the tutorials are actually more general than it appears. Feel free to jump around the different sections. Its only when it comes to displaying the game that the enginespecific steps come into play.Since then Ive gone on to using MonoGame and the Nez library. Nice to have another C developer in the mix. ,roguelikedev,df2yoxl,2,t5_2si41
11222255,0,t1_df3jl98,Cool! And welcome back Hm suddenly within the past week there are like  new cyberpunk RLs in the works up from zero hehe. Maybe one of them will actually be finished one day? Its a niche waiting to be filled by.... anything Pit should be noted that WASD are the commands to move... thought it was broken for a bit since arrows numpad or hjkl didnt work!,roguelikedev,df411ln,2,t5_2si41
11309343,0,t1_dfdw6me,Oh wow somebody is playing? That means more than you can think! DIts been so long since I had any sort of feedback that I thought any interest went and died!,roguelikedev,dfdwaqh,2,t5_2si41
11310261,0,t3_61cmxe,Dungeons of EverchangeUnfortunately not too much happened on DoE side during the week. At the beginning of the week I have almost finished burning skeletons meantime my wife got sick and ended in hospital. Im at home with two little kids  long time have been that I have spent so much time with them so Im enjoying it at least.Have a nice weekend.,roguelikedev,dfe01d2,3,t5_2si41
11430306,0,t3_62zb5r,Since you say world generation just a thought The first dungeon level could be presented as soon as its done the rest could be generated by a background thread incl. blocking if you happen to climb down very fast.,roguelikedev,dfrm2zg,2,t5_2si41
11433118,0,t3_637jbs,Another idea is to add fuzziness to the time taken by various actions. For example if you do something that takes  seconds maybe it is   . seconds. This plusorminus modification could be random normally distributed?. The actor player or mob is then pushed further in time for its next action but you never know exactly how far back it has been pushed nor exactly how long your own action will take. This would make timing attacks to avoid being hit more difficult.As a sideidea maybe as characters gain in levels their standard deviation could be reduced?,roguelikedev,dfrxkla,3,t5_2si41
11515201,0,t3_64d30b,Some games do implement physics on a grid Dwarf Fortress comes immediately to mind.  But thats all been handhacked and certainly isnt anything near a complete physics sim just enough to scatter items and body parts around the impact area.  Still enough to turn minecarts into giant shotguns though.As for granularity to cells sure why not youre already doing it anyway by translating the physics world coordinates to pixels so a cell is just a very big pixel for that purpose.  Unfortunately theyre almost certainly too big to be practical meaning youll probably have to lose the grid.  Still makes for a perfectly good roguelike just think Gauntlet rather than Nethack.  You could keep things logically in one cell but track and render them more precisely... but youll likely spend as much time having to fix and fudge things to correct for the visual glitches that would result.,roguelikedev,dg18zv7,5,t5_2si41
11551242,0,t3_64v9wg,If you know enough to create your own thing thats a pretty good way to learn. Theres a difference though between thinking you are ready and actually being ready. Anyway if you go that route dont start with your lesstraditional ideas. Start small do something that will take you anywhere from a couple of weeks to several months. Dont go for your yearslong dream project yet. Dont do fancy stuff but stick to something traditional. Its supposed to be a learning project not an ambitious one. Believe me that the knowledge and experience gained will benefit you when you start something big later on.Im not sure how many roguelike devs are welcoming if you try to approach them for help in working together. Many are closedsource and wont even accept contributions if you send them in Temple of Torments creator for example told me he wouldnt accept any map generation contributions even whle he admitted his own generation algorithm sucks. Others are opensource but terrible to work with all the times Ive contributed to rDCSS for example have been a pain in the ass  one of my patches sat on the bug tracker for  years before getting in. Another one even if it was a copy paste of a feature that was missing on the localtiles version of the game was criticized for not being crawl coding standard among other things it was literally a copypaste of another section code found in another version honestly. The only easy way Ive found of getting patches in is having a dev read and commit them for me because cowards are happy to criticize a copypaste for not being coding standard but sure wont speak up against another dev will they?. Its such an involved process I gave up on it entirely.Anyway it can be hard but I think that if you can find someone to work with you and youre actually helping someone elses real project then it can be very valuable. You can learn a lot by working on someone elses playground and being able to converse with them about game design principles coding practices etc. I would recommend doing that over doing your own thing  but just forking a project and hacking around when you can do something yourself has no merit to it I think  unless youre planning to contribute the code upstream. Of course if you have a game in mind that you already love then go for it and hack away but finding a game just so you can hack a local clone is worse than creating your own.My game Javelin isnt the most traditional roguelike out there at all and its grown to be quite complex at this point. If you like Java as a language and you like the project you can always check out the . branch on GitHub which is getting pretty close to being done maybe a week or so. Im not sure its a good entrylevel project to work on but if youve got some experience in you I could use some help with new spells and such.,roguelikedev,dg5c4hv,2,t5_2si41
11583398,0,t3_659d61,Tower of the Red LionThere are no races or classes in my game. Characters are completely defined by the items they carry. This gives players a huge amount of freedom in terms of what characters they can make but also comes with its own share of problems. For example what if a player starts building a mage character but after floor  they only find melee weapons? To help with this problem there is a crafting system or rather there will be a crafting system and guaranteed boss loot. While these systems wont allow players to always play the exact character they want theyll at least make sure that players will always find upgrades or useable items.gtWhat kinds of characters can players choose to start with andor become in your roguelike?Its possible to build all the standard fantasy archetypes fighters mages rangers in my game but there are also some more unique characters. For example with the Ring of Thorns and the Winters Gauntlet its possible to build a Retaliation Tank where enemies will kill themselves while attacking you not the best build for bosses. Other cool characters are e.g. Melee Mages that use phaseshift to defend themselves phaseshifted units cant deal or receive physical damage or Ice Assassins that kill enemies with poison while keeping them frozen to prevent counter attacks.gtHow fundamentally different are they? How do they play?This is something I really struggle with. For example the Melee Mages I mentioned play more or less the same as traditional melee fighters. I try to alleviate this problem by giving each damage type its own personality. For example Fire damage will burn enemies with the oil status while Ice damage will freeze enemies that stand in water.All in all I still have a lot to do when it comes to character customization but that will get better as I introduce new items to the game. Right now there are only  different items for  equipment slots so of course theres going to be overlap between different archetypes.,roguelikedev,dg8zh17,4,t5_2si41
11616344,0,t3_65orxe,Primary design documentation comments in source code itself.Secondary is very adhoc at the moment.  Id like to commit to TiddlyWiki as one step up from text files but anything that works out of the box only in Chrome and IE is suspect so I cant trust that format for indefinite use.  Niche fallbacks are thought to be spreadsheets and something for diagramming but neither of these has been tested recently.,roguelikedev,dgcq16g,2,t5_2si41
11622577,0,t3_65s2l9,Ive been slowly developing a pet project in BearLibTerminal using Python  for a couple of years now. This might be just the thing to help it along.Thanks uirskep! ,roguelikedev,dgdfhvf,2,t5_2si41
11671885,0,t1_dgipnzx,Thanks! I have my own personal method on picking colours.Here are a few tips avoid extreme saturation or contrast Limit your colour palette Use warm over cool colours.Some practical examples Black   Ink Black  White FFFFFF  Cream White FFCC  colour palette The orange amp blue always works In the future Ill probably post a simple guide with some examples on how to improve colours if its helpful...,roguelikedev,dgj0vwp,4,t5_2si41
11762042,0,t3_67ou2s,For things like this I wonder if simple expressions would suffice. If I dont need turing completeness I just forgo the language itself and make a primitive ASTlike expression data structure eg    MyExpressionltWeapon boolgt shouldBeInBag  And      AttackGreaterThanCurrentWeapon        ValueGreaterThan  You could also make the GreaterThan more granular if needed    Imagine these functions And AttackGreaterThan CurrentWeapon ValueGreaterThan are all factories than return our intermediate AST expressions. Then at runtime you can evaluate shouldBeInBag with a Weapon object to return a bool. This gives you a few things. Trivial to parse a language into this expression format especially scheme. You dont need the heavy lifting of a turing complete scripting language. Theres a lot to be said about DSLs which are NOT turing complete  you dont need to worry about the halting problem parallelization might be easier optimization might be easier. The expressions are inspectable at runtime. This means you could generate a tooltip to the user Weapons with attack greater than the current weapon and value greater than . You could theoretically have an ingame GUI for the user to build these expression objects draganddrop builder or something,roguelikedev,dgt99dr,2,t5_2si41
