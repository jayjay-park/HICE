1199931,0,t3_27u0pc,Its likely because out of all the music genre subreddits rcountry is the least popular with the exception of rjazzfusion.  Overall I read more people on reddit talking shit about country music above and beyond any other genre.  Because of that our subreddits content is usually subpar.  We dont get into analytics of music offer weekly or biweekly album reviews and the biggest country music drama weve ever discussed was Josh Gracin being an asshole to Billy Ray.On the flipside because our subscribers are so few theyre usually a more committed fanbase and Ive had great conversations with people on here due to that.  Itd be nice if we could get all the subscribers from rcountrymusic to just move over to rcountry so wed have one resource to talk about the music ,country,ci4lzr8,1,t5_2qnqv

3975455,1,t3_35zxqm,Dont listen to country music elitists country music is what you make it as far as the popular stuff try out Kenny Chesney Florida Georgia Line Luke Bryan and Blake Shelton. You can argue Toby Keith deserves to be in this group.Mid level popularity guys try looking for Easton Corbin Billy Currington Brett Eldridge and Gary Allan who probably deserves to be in group .Low level and kinda obscure guys look for more of your texas and dirt road country also check out raltcountry or rOutlawCountry  try looking for guys like Wade Bowen Casey Donahew Band JB and the Moonshine band and Turnpike Troubadours.As far as old school there is tons of it Hank Williams both  amp  also Hank  is doing his thing but he also does some heavy rock with his Waylon Jennings Dwight Yoakam Johnny Cash and Willie Nelson.My biggest advice though would be to look for artists earlier songs they might not be as polished but they are really good songs.,country,cr9foq1,-1,t5_2qnqv
