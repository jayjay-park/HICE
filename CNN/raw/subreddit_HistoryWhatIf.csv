2671189,0,t3_2qkw7w,Indian independence would likely have been bloodier. Keep in mind over a million people died when British held India was split into India and West and East Bangladesh Pakistan. Many of the the Muslim league leaders had dismissed the Congress Party and Gandhi as simply a front for Hindus despite what Gandhi said to the contrary. Perhaps is Gandhi had not been present in the independence movement the Muslim league would have viewed the Congress Party as more secular and no split would have occurred.On the other hand Gandhi did manage to keep much of the independence movement peaceful so without him you might have been looking at a much more violent movement. In any case independence happens with or without Gandhi because the British didnt want to be there anymore.  ,HistoryWhatIf,cn78wuz,2,t5_35koa
2677647,0,t1_cn82xi6,gt One nuke on London which is more than possible almost easy if they had a viable bomb would have won Germany the war.Because unexpected attacks against the Allies in WWII totally convinced them to back out of the fight.Maybe Germany would have decided to retrofit a He  to carry the bomb for the attack with Britains radar and air superiority I still dont think they would risk it and maybe it could have hit London but that would in no way knock them out of the fight. The bombs would devestate part of the city for sure cause probably upwards of  dead but London had already lost some  in the Blitz and firebombing of cities like Hamburg had already proven that massive destruction was possible with conventional weapons.The bombing of London would then become a huge rallying point for the allies and as London was largely civilian and the manufacturing was mostly distributed it would have a small to moderate but very manageable effect of the Allied war effort.By the time of the Dday landings Italy was falling Africa was falling and the Eastern front was falling in a big way. Theres not much that could possibly change the tide at this point.gtAll they needed was another  troops the oil fields and the skoda arms factory for a couple more years and they would have won anywayThats a pretty huge list of demands actually.

2850932,0,t3_2sqwwa,Assuming this is possible we can extrapolate a few things.  Either Japan was much more successful in China and can extract rare earth ores and other resources from Chinese mines or Japan had the prophetic foresight to stockpile raw materials from international trade prior to .  The first is considerably more likely..  Japan has the industrial base and knowledge to enrich uranium while engaged in war both with the Chinese and the USUKAustraliaNetherlands.  Additionally Japan can divert resources during wartime to build a breeder reactor either at home or in China or Korea..  Japan has a delivery system for such a bomb that is more advanced than simply using a truck or horse carriage to drive it up to enemy lines.My hunch in such a scenario is that through diplomacy Japan convinces Germany to embargo China in  or .  This deprives the Chinese of badly needed weapons ammunition and other war material.  The combined Nationalist Communist and warlord armies suffer a string of defeats and are too illequipped and demoralized to continue to fight for the coastal or not too distant inland regions.  Japan acts swiftly and grants amnesty to any Chinese that will aid them in organizing the mainland economy to fuel Japanese industry.This supplies Japan with steel lead coal and eventually uranium making the manufacture of ships aircraft ammunition and eventually nuclear projects possible.  While Japan is still not an industrial match for the United States the Pacific war drags on much longer.  With German input from advisers sent over via Uboat the FisherTropsch process begins producing motor fuels in China by .The US still develops their own bomb by  but Japan still lags behind.  American Bs are still fully capable of raiding Japan but casualties are considerably higher since the Japanese have access to Chinese steel and ammunition to build AA defenses on a scale not possible in OTL.  American payloads are also smaller due to the presumably greater distances needed to travel for aerial raids.  Japanese resistance to conventional bombers is therefore greater.Conversely Japan still lacks the resources to build large engined bombers on a useful scale.  The Japanese fleet air arm is not largely destroyed in the Marianas in  but Japanese factories continue to turn out carrier planes to replace its ongoing losses though the pilots are arguably of lower quality.  The lack of a heavy bomber means that unless Japan crams a nuke into a midget submarine which adds considerably to RampD time the US fleets are still reasonably safe from nuclear attack by the time Japan builds a functional nuke in  or so.Germany collapses around  or .  Since the US must divert considerable resources to fighting a bigger Japan there are considerably fewer allied bombers and troops in the ETO and the longerrange Bs are entirely used against Japan while the smaller models soldier on in Europe.  This means no nukes used in Germany. The Soviets get around to declaring war on Japan a few months later.  The US may or may not have used a nuke carried by a B against a highvalue target in Japan by this point but the size of the Chinese industrial base and manpower pool is great enough to make this a moot point given that the early nukes were capable of finishing a beaten enemy but not a healthy one.  US nuke production is slow enough to make this an occasional horror but not a weekly occurrence assuming that a nukeladen B had enough fuel to make the trip anyhow.The Soviet army gets nuked in Manchuria or Korea by Japan using a lowtech method probably a truck with a kamikaze crew.  Suddenly the invasion of Japan becomes a terrifying prospect with the destruction of an invading army assured.  This leaves the USUKSoviets with two options.  Either leave Japan a smoking irradiated crater or starve her to death by wrecking her ability to make more bombs and cutting off Chinese shipping.  The Soviets prefer the former while stinging from the loss of  troops due to a Japanese nuke but the USUK prefer the latter.  Given that the Soviets have no nukes yet the latter option is used.  The US shifts focus to anything that looks like a nuke facility from photo reconnaissance and mistakes are made.  After several attempts the facility is knocked out and the Sea of Japan is blockaded.  The Soviets kill millions in their revenge campaign down the Chinese coast bolstered by US air power from carriers and eventually landbased planes from Okinawa.  While still doing badly in  this Japan is still more able to fight than our Japan in  due to stockpiles of resources and ammunition from years of Chinese occupation.  Now able to nuke with relative impunity the US does so against several more Japanese targets forcing an eventual surrender in  or  without an invasion of the home islands.This allows a Sovietbacked communist government to take power in China in the postwar years as well as a Sovietbacked state over the entire Korean peninsula.  Presumably Vietnam is occupied by the Soviets as well and not by the French.The irradiated ruins of Japan are reluctantly organized into a US ally after their total collapse after hearing tales of what the Soviets do to people they occupy.  Taiwan happily does the same.  Japan has a tremendous rate of cancer and birth defects for decades to come and does not become the postwar economic powerhouse that we know in OTL.  Europe is still divided up along familiar cold war lines.The hardwon Soviet war effort solidifies belief in the states necessity to its people for much longer and Stalins successors are less quick to tarnish his legacy.  There is no Glasnost in the s and the Soviet Union remains in power long past the year .  Secondarily the entire Pacific Rim is under Communist control which alters the entire history of the region.India fully aware of the struggle against Japan is released in  as a Commonwealth nation including Pakistan Bangladesh Sri Lanka and Burma and welcomes the US and UK to host as many weapons there as theyd like finding this kind of multiethnic superstate and its associated problems preferable to Soviet or Chinese control.There is also no Vietnam or Korean war due to both nations being under Soviet control and Afghanistan quickly falls into the BritishIndian sphere of influence in the s to avoid Soviet invasion.  East Germany and other Warsaw Pact nations remain so as long as there is a Soviet Union to keep them there.The cold war conflicts in this timeline occur elsewhere.  My money is on Latin America and Africa.  Its possible that some of them go nuclear on a local scale given the pedigree for occasional use in Japan but probably not on a level that invites international armageddon.I would also not be surprised to see Israel use a nuclear bomb against any of their Arab neighbors in response to a threat and USSoviet negotiations managing to settle both sides into an uneasy truce to avoid the aforementioned armageddon.In general smaller nukes become accepted for use in regional warfare but not for intercontinental superpower fights although the threat is real and longer lasting.,HistoryWhatIf,cns5fr4,26,t5_35koa

The Gestapo were  unfortunately for most  quite successful in suppressing antiNazi movements and hunting Hitlers undesirables. Once Nazi Germany makes the shift from total war to peace time efforts towards the war would move towards other fields. Surely the Third Reich would realize that theyve upset the entire world thus an exceptional intelligence branch would be required to keep tabs on their enemies. Considering that Stalin knew of the first successful nuclear detonation the same time Truman was first told and how corrupt and incapable the USSR really was Germany strong enough to repel the world should produce a remarkable espionage service. Theyve been successful before. Otto Skorzeny and his unit became fluent in Allied behavior ex. how to light matches the American way and parachuted behind Allied lines before the Battle of the Bulge.

The Brits had Cherokee and Iroquois representatives showing up in London and an Abenaki chief from near where I live was knighted by the King of France in Paris. The French tended to get more tribes on their side since with their lack of colonists they didnt end up stepping on many peoples toes and could afford to be quite friendly with the locals without angering their own colonists. The British on the other hand had fewer tribal allies but the most powerful and aggressive native confederacy the Iroquois were on their side so when the British and Iroquois beat the French and their allies all the losing tribes and French colonists fell by the wayside whereas the Iroquois were treated pretty well up until America rebelled and eventually defeated the Iroquois nation in .

3391930,0,t3_2z0k4f,Im going to ignore France in this as I dont have the knowledge to support myself. Britain retains to a certain extent its empire by creating a sort of federalised commonwealth which is made up of The United Kingdom Canada Australia amp New Zealand either as one or separate depending on the representative systemsee below The Dominion of the Caribbean  Egypt and or British North Africa depending on gains from Italy British Central Africa South Africa  India  British Far East Made up of all the enclaves north of Australia Britain abandons the Middle East as in OTL because fuck that noise. including all the tiny islands enclaves and that one bit in South America that no one really remembers. The dominions have their own representatives either shared out equally or based on population with white states and the U.K receiving more votes to counter the African Dominions and India and debate legislature in a House of Representatives HoR first established in the U.K the house will probably migrate between nations to improve sense of involvement once infrastructure and appropriate buildings have been established in the less developed dominions.All foreign affairs are conducted within the HoR although the U.K has the prerogative in such matters in this sense they adopt the position of say the U.S president in that they may effectively veto legislature but can be overturned if they are isolated. Whilst domestic affairs are largely devolved to each dominion that hasnt already received such powers the HoR does retain the right to criticise and in extreme occasions act on decisions and events made within other dominions. The first act of the HoR is to ease restrictions on interdominion travel. The U.K is badly in need of labour and so looks to India and the Caribbean for cheap labour. Similarly Australia advertises to Africa and Asia to bring in cheap miners and investors respectively so that they can exploit their natural resources both initially suffer from racial tensions induced by this policy.There are several movements within Africa and India to leave the Commonwealth entirely. At Britains behest these movements are quelled by local authorities. The problems persist in India for some time. Once the problem of labour is solved work can begin on fixing the economy and building the first BBomb Britannia Bomb or Britbomb for short. The finest minds from each country are assembled in Oxford and the first Commonwealth Atomic Bomb is developed and tested in . Australia is given the honour of being the first Commonwealth nation to be hit with an atom bomb.  Thanks to the Commonwealths friendly posture towards scientific and military ingenuity Canada comes up with a Supersonic Jet Aircraft design that astounds the other dominions. The AvroCanada enters service as the Commonwealths elite interceptor for the U.K Canada and India the most likely targets for Soviet Aggression although it can only be deployed in small numbers initially. The design is later incorporated into the VBomber project giving the Commonwealth a supersonic nuclear bomber option. Going deeper into the Commonwealths nuclear capabilities its primary method of delivery is submersibles with each dominion providing funding for Royal Navy Ballistic Nuclear Submarines. Their stockpile is enough to make the Soviets Sweat but is not as large as the U.Ss or The USSRs. The VBombers are present in the U.K West Germany Canada Australia India and Egypt covering every inch of Communist frontline. Of course during this time the Korean War occurs whilst India Africa and the Caribbean are reluctant to engage the U.K Australasia and Canada are more willing to become involved. Using volunteer servicemen from across the Commonwealth the AngloCommonwealth bolster the U.N forces much more than it did IOTL of course the result remains the same although they are able to demonstrate their martial capabilities much more effectively due to increased spending power. Cuba The Commonwealth strongly backs the United States embargo of the island  Vietnam the U.S calls upon the Commonwealth to aid in the war. IOTL there is already mass civil unrest in the British Far East however with more domestic freedom I can see this being less severe if not completely irrelevant. The Commonwealth decides not to intervene predicting that a similar outcome to Korea would occur. Relations with the U.S are soured by this approach as the Commonwealth brokers a peace deal with the two warring factions The U.Sstarved of the support of its largest military ally is forced to enter negotiations. All U.S forces are withdrawn from South Asia. North Vietnamese military operations cease completely... for around a year when North Vietnam launches a lightning strike into the South completely crushing all resistance.

3513999,0,t3_30ghxg,Heres a neat alternate history timeline I spun up a few weeks ago. It concerns an empirewide decentralization effort in the rd century AD which devolves the Roman Empire into a number of autonomous principalities republics and marches.Our alternate timeline begins with the ascension of Hadrian as Emperor in . Following the death of his predecessor Trajan Hadrian inherits an Empire which had absorbed a massive amount of territory through conquest.Hadrians tenure as Emperor will see a heavy effort to consolidate said territorial gains while maintaining the military strength and authority of the Empire.Now lets make two distinct changes to our Point of Divergence in this scenario Hadrian abandons Dacia and reestablishes the permanent Balkan border south of the Danube. He calls back all the settlers sent there instead promising them more arable more secure land elsewhere in the empire. In return he surrenders all Romancontrolled land in Dacia to the Roxolani who accept Roman client state status. A new symbiotic relation is forged as a result and the Roxolani become friends of Rome. Also as in our timeline Armenia and Mesopotamia are left to their own devices considered indefensible. In order to ensure his grasp on the throne and to dissuade possible overambition of his generals Hadrian ends the governorgeneral command of imperial and border provinces. He owes his success to the loyalty of the legions which dissuade revolt or otherwise violent reaction by the upper echelon of Roman society.Instead Hadrian begins the process of incorporating Senatorial representation within the provinces. As a philohellene he envisions an Athenian direct democracy in the capital city of every Roman province promising due provincial representation in the Imperial chamber of Rome.Every remaining Roman province is granted civitas and permitted representation. The subjects of those provinces are allowed to elect Senators for their very own Provincial Senate each of which will elect their own Dux to represent their interests in Rome.This will not work as intended by Hadrian. Many of the provinces had not been sufficiently Romanized and significant conflicts of interest will occur. However the mass enfranchisement of Roman subjects and the birth of democracy in these urbanized islands in the provincial wilds will take strong roots. The influx of Roman veterans settling in these provinces will boost the population and small land and wealth grants to the neutered Roman generals will allow them to invest their burning ambition into their new latifundia. The birth of a new upper class of Roman society results with the landing of the generals with the nobility of the latifundia contracting local tribes for work in exchange for food shelter and education.The latifundia will assist heavily in the Romanization of the provinces. Now tied to the land for guaranteed sustenance the tribes will settle down and form villages around the latifundia.Hadrian will pass with the territorial integrity of the Empire remaining intact. There will be no major wars during his reign save for the Bar Kokha Revolt in Judaea.As the decades pass the simmering tensions between the democratic Provincial Senates the latifundianobility and the Roman Emperor will result whether peacefully or by violent means in a significant shift in power towards the autonomous provinces. Roman central power will fade but a threeway symbiosis will incur the Emperor relying on the latifundia for manpower the latifundia relying on the Emperor for legitimacy and both Emperor and latifundia relying on the provinces for political support in the Imperial chamber. The provinces who end up collecting the taxes from their citizens come out on top as the dominant holders of power in the Empire. The strength of will in democratic processes will become blatantly evident.The authority of Rome will fade quietly across the next few centuries but the ceremonial and cultural significance of the city will continue to hold utmost importance in the Empire.The latifundia will slowly grow into major centers of population in the now Romanized provinces. With this comes an explosion of trade never beforeseen in the Western world with hundreds of new unique Roman dialects intermingling in the Mediterranean. Latin will remain the lingua francia in the West. Innovation of ideas and the sciences continue in those cities that permit freedom of movement of their citizens.The next and greatest test will be the Barbarian Migration. A massive influx of uncivilized warrior societies attempting to croas the Rhine and Danube will face massive fortifications welldefended cities and wellfunded standing armies of the nobility. However the unrelenting wave of barbarians will cause a massive amount of damage and death unseen in the Empire for centuries and the nobility will take this opportunity to gain more power for themselves. The Provinces will be powerless to resist this claim to power having been long paralyzed by this point by rampant corruption and a lack of military strength.The Emperor relying on a small personal force to protect his own heredity holdings will lose a significant amount of prestige and authority. The landed nobility of Rome now semiindependent principalities in their own right and each holding significant amounts of military strength begin to form alliances and leagues amongst themselves for mutual defense of their holdings.The Barbarian Migrations subside and the Crisis of the th and th Centuries subside. Roman civilization is alive and strong but there is no more Empire in practice  from Britannia to Iberia to North Africa kingdoms and principalities eschew the corrupt listless Provinces and begin to seize political power for themselves.The new Roman kingdoms are based on the borders of the old Imperial provinces  trading republics of Lusitania Frisia and Venetia militarized marchstates of Silvanegra and Pannonia centers of innovation and knowledge arise in small theocratic principalities scattered amongst kingdoms and free duchies. All of these remain subjects of the Emperor in Rome and swear allegiance and tribute to him but no longer do Imperial legions march in these free states.Neighboring lands that hadnt been conquered by Rome slowly begin to unite and form their socities based on the Roman method taking on Latin as language of trade. Hibernia Sarmatia Caledonia Germania Scandia and Armenia amongst others.Things to considerWith this decentralized sprawling Empire with power based in several largepopulated states will the Imperial regnancy remain in Rome proper or will the Roman Emperorship be conferred on the strongest of these states? How would these states elect their Emperor?The introduction of Christianity into Roman society will inevitably begin conflicts between the traditionalist pagans and the new Christians. How will this play out in the decentralized Roman Emperor? Will we see Wars of Religion between the free states like in our Thirty Years War or will a more religiously tolerant and varied Empire result?Further more how will the division of Christianity into sects affect the free states and their cultural development?How will the rise of Byzantium as the eminent city of the time affect the balance of power amongst the Roman free states? Will we see an EastWest divide as in our timeline?How will the Slavic Migrations in the th century affect the Eastern flank of Roman civilization?Islam.,HistoryWhatIf,cpstkwg,2,t5_35koa

Even if this were true their motivation education level and native language and culture might have made them poor soldiers for Germany as well.  The Germans made use of what were dubbed Ost battalions in Normandy and most of them were Poles and other Slavs recruited from POW camps by way of hunger.  Their performance against highly motivated Allied troops in Normandy was abysmal and they often wouldnt fight at all without a German officer with a pistol standing behind them.  Conversely the exSoviet soldiers that fell into German hands during Stalingrad were a lot more useful given that they would almost certainly be shot or worse if they were recaptured by the Soviets.That said as semivoluntary laborers most of these people of working age might have been put to use building weapons or other wartime supplies or simply as farm hands.  This may well have freed up some German manpower but probably not  given the notorious distrust the Nazi regime had for its civilians to say nothing of civilians in occupied territories.Lastly while the Nazi government may have murdered  million civilians on purpose for demographic reasons there were plenty more killed indirectly or accidentally.

The Cathars believed that one would be repeatedly reincarnated until one commits to the selfdenial of the material world which meant that a man could be reincarnated as a woman and vice versa thereby rendering gender completely meaningless.

4486525,0,t3_3chnlg,Theres a chance that Japan might not see itself at war with the USA at all if they did not invade China or have any long term conflict with them. Japanese expansionism against China eventually prompted FDR to enact an oil embargo that caused Japan to attack Pearl Harbour and strike out at British and Dutch holdings to seize the resources they needed to continue their war in China. The lack of conflict in China would mean no Xian incident in  to force Chiang KaiShek to form a shaky alliance with the Communists and instead continue to whittle them down or ultimately break them in  or  as German trained divisions are completed and tested in battle.  With no war in China Germany is more inclined to continue aiding them in exchange for more tungsten and antimony until  when the outbreak of war renders it almost impossible to complete these transactions. Though the KMT now have a solid forty divisions of reliable troops that can easily outperform warlord troops and enjoy the support of a little more modernized industry. These new divisions are also a credible threat to Japanese forces though they are a light on artillery with very few aircraft and tanks. The fact that the KMT are becoming this strong might see Japan aiding other warlord states as they did in reality to upset the balance of power in China or agitate an incident to invade Manchuria but face the possibility of things spiralling into full scale war against a much more confident and able Chinese army. But this could be ended with an uneasy ceasefire brokered by Germany or the USA to protect their own interests in the region as the strength of the improved Chinese forces would give them a stronger hand at the negotiating table.  American involvement in WWII is still possible as there was an undeclared conflict with German UBoats to help materiel aid reach the UK but it would ultimately delay full on war until enough US naval losses see public opinion swing in favour of war. The late entry to the war in Europe would see the Soviets controlling more of Europe if they receive Lend Lease in time as DDay would be a riskier and later undertaking with less experienced American forces. But of course this hinges on FDR still being able to nudge America onto a less neutral footing otherwise the Soviets will be in for a much longer struggle without Lend Lease and the UK unable to do little but eventually secure North Africa and continue night time strategic bombing in support of the Soviets. As long as Japan does not go for all out war China would eventually see its most valuable regions firmly controlled by the KMT though it might be over a decade or two until all of China is under nominal unification. ,HistoryWhatIf,csw6u12,2,t5_35koa

Honecker the East German head of state had worked for decades to keep anybody competent away from power so when he got serioulsy ill in summer  everything just fell apart. Nobody dared to act on his behalf.Your history whatif would have to start earlier with Honeckers bid for power in  failing and another person holding the top job in . Then history could have gone different. Another person getting the top job could also have prevented the massive spending in the s and s on social welfare to keep the population quiet and happy which ultimately would have led to the GDR filing for bankruptcy. I remember how about November December  it first looked as if the new East German government would be in charge for quite some time but in reality they were seriously hampered by the massive debts. Honecker or one of his cronies had the grand idea in the s to borrow as much as possible from western governments the plan was to first never pay it back and second to wreck the evil capitalist economy of the west with this devilish plan. Did not quite work this way. In  those debts were like a millstone hanging around the GDRs neck.  ,HistoryWhatIf,cw4k5rm,3,t5_35koa

Youd think he would have a hard time conquering arab territory but the mongols are the ones responsible for a lot of the local conversion to Islam. Especially among the elite. The hordes khanates and dynasties wouldnt be less multiethnic and mulifaith under Buddhist leadership than they were under Muslim leadership so the strength of his armies wouldnt have suffered in a way I can foresee. I dont know if it would affect the relationship with China. Timur died trying to restore the Yuan dynasty and even if hed been Buddhist Ming China is heavily steeped in Confucianism and is unlikely to want to be folded into a conquering force. Timur already cultivated a surprising number of relationships with european kings eager and pleased for him to be defeating the Turks so I imagine if on top of that he hadnt been calling himself the sword of Islam there would be fewer enemies in Europe to an alliance with him.,HistoryWhatIf,cwaxb0n,2,t5_35koa

6347763,0,t1_czaw3c9,Yeah I can. Sorry for being glib. I assume that in this Timeline the French never sail up the St. Lawrence river to Montreal and instead focus their settlement on the Nova Scotia coast which I guess should be Nouvelle France now. A coastal settlement is even more likely to be at risk of getting conquered by the British so the French lose this theatre of the Seven Years war very badly. Assuming the British still give the Catholic French legal concessions it would be a selfgoverning province of isolationist fishermen. The American revolutionary war Napoleonic War War of  Boer War WW and WW would make this little peninsula and its Atlantic harbour capital a major shipping point of all transatlantic travel from NA to the Old World. The British would not be interested in letting it go and the FrenchCanadians wouldnt be all that interested in leaving. Once the secularist movements pop up in the s it will be followed by francophone equality movements and eventually they will start to demand separation from the British for greater sovereignty. The other provinces will no doubt be surprised to hear that one of the most independent provinces with a long history of concessions is asking for more but the capital port town will have long waned in strategic and economic importance. Quebec has Hydroelectricity and is one of the largest provinces in Canada in terms of area and population. The Federal government spent a lot of money on the No vote during the referendums. Nova Scotia is much smaller in terms of population and natural resources. I might be way off here but I also have a hunch the Mikmaq would have been less confrontational than the Cree. I think that with less of a vested interest in in each other the large majority white french catholic population of Nova Scotia would vote more than  to leave Canada by the s.Thats only part of the question though. The first Canada was formed by combining what are now the populous parts of Ontario and Quebec into one province. Quebec far outnumbered Ontario and so FrenchCanadian participation was absolutely necessary to elect and form a government. This long history of cooperation and compromise helped to form the Canadian identity and was extremely valuable in the negotiations with the other British holdings in NA for the purposes of confederation. Without the longlist of French Canadian statesmen that helped to build the country of Canada it could have a very different character as a country. Which is another strong reason to suspect FrenchCanadian separation in Nova Scotia. Without strong representation in the Federal government without even a local block of sympathetic provinces what would this local minority have to lose?,HistoryWhatIf,czb64hq,6,t5_35koa

In the midst of it some damnfool Soviet general goes on a long rant on air about never letting Belarus or the Crimea go.Belarus activates the teams and declares independence announcing that they are nuclearcapable. They promise no first use but threaten nuclear retaliation if the Soviets try to coerce not just Belarus with their nukes but any Republic whether it has declared independence or not. Negotiations with Ukraine and Kazakhstan enrolls the other two most powerful republics in exchange for some of the missiles Belarus has gained control of. The coup in Moscow of course fails anyway but the deed is done.Soon there is an exrepublic coalition that succeeds far better than the Commonwealth of Independent States ever did in our world. Although it was created in opposition to the Russians in some ways there is never a big break in existing ties moreso than happened in our world anyway as a result of the republics becoming independent and over time those ties continue and make it a somewhat less tense relationship than that between India and Pakistan. Later changes in government in the three newly nucleararmed republics will cause occasional consternation on the world stage.Although officially condemning the spread of nuclear weapons most people in power around the world are secretly pleased to see both the Soviets and Russia firmly put down by their own and once they are satisfied that the general is not going to act rashly with them acknowledge the new nuclear reality.

If theres some advantageous reason to have seaships then designs that would be impractical in our world because they would be deemed too expensive complicated and unecessary would be favored in this world where theyd be considered essential for safe passage. If you want good medieval utilitarian ships then North Sea Cogs and Chinese Junks are good models that are at home in rivers or canals as well as rough seas. For a bigger fast ship you would have to play around with hull types. Catamarans with multiple hulls or SWATH type vessels with multiple sunken hulls would definitely be stable but would be strange warships. Im also unsure if Medieval or Renaissance materials would be able to support such a ship design. Without gunpowder Im not really sure what you intend by a warship. Something built for ramming and boarding like a trireme or bigger?With turbulent weather being able to sail into the wind would be a big advantage over heavier ships more dependent on the wind. Catching a current would be helpful if you knew where they were so something like a sea anchor could be useful there. If your ship is small enough then a bow mounted sea anchor could be used to move the ship in the direction of a current. Historical naval chases have lasted hours days weeks. A ship with a  larger crew might be able to simply tire out a smaller crewed ship by being able to rotate duties and allow its crew to rest. In tough weather a small crew could get tired fast and unable to properly man their vessel. One aspect of your smaller world though is that the horizons would be tighter which means ships would dip below the horizon line faster. This means a ship can sneak up on you much quicker as by the time you see it on the horizon it would be closer than it would be on our world and you would have a harder time tracking a ship because it wouldnt need to get as far before its out of sight. ,HistoryWhatIf,d164cix,2,t5_35koa

The belief in godgods was closely intertwined with their ethnicityculture and there is no real penalty for not accepting those godstraditions.While a central tenant in Christianity and Islam is that if you dont follow their Gods rules you burn in a lake of fire.

One of the KPDs founders Rosa Luxemburg did not have very good things to say about the organisation and management of the Bolsheviks. The partys ideology was fairly different to the MarxismLeninism of the USSR.

The Congolese adopted Catholicism and it wasnt long before the syncretic Antonian movement was spread by Dona Beatriz who preached that Jesus was a black man and heaven was for Africans similar to Ethiopian Rastafari. If the Antonian movement was more widespread the Congolese people may have rallied under a new religious cause an stood their ground long enough to avoid colonization. Kongo would still be surrounded by Portuguese colonies and thus its culture would be continually syncretized with Portuguese. The only way the resilient Kongo would stay independent would be from the slave trade similar to the ring Dahomey kingdom in the east. Congolese raiders would expand and then sell to Portuguese and other Europeans. They would not be able to buy the best guns and would have to keep many slaves for themselves for military and agricultural purposes. Unlike Ethiopia Kongo does not have any geographic barriers and would avoid colonization by economic prosperity and a large army all the while europeanizing from trade an diplomacy and becoming an Uncle Tom kingdom. Eventually Kongo might be able to sign a treaty for the recognition of its independence. Thus Kongo would stay independent in the era of colonialism. It would be hard though for Kongo without geographic barriers to resist imperialism of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.,HistoryWhatIf,d3jio7f,4,t5_35koa

As far as his musical career Holly would more than likely return to the studio and record more songs and release more singles and LPs. Whether the plane crash would affect his desire to tour again remains to be seen. However its safe to say that songs written by him would be in high demand by other artists so he could turn his career to songwriting and live somewhat comfortably.In regards to Waylon Jennings his career as a musician hadnt quite established itself and sadly he would be remembered outside of West Texas as the bass player that died in the plane crash that killed Ritchie Valens and The Big Bopper.,HistoryWhatIf,d41u3rl,3,t5_35koa

8211098,0,t3_4rrrcz,July . Mathew Perry enters Edo Bay. After a show of force and a few weeks of Bureaucratic negotiations Japan is indecisive in their decision. The current Shogun is severely ill and his advisers are split. Mathew Perry promises to return the following Spring for a final answer.Days after Perrys departure the Shogun dies and his young weakling son succeeds him. Meanwhile Perry learns of Russia Britain and Frances ambition to also open up Japan. Instead of returning in Spring he comes back in February . This time with additional ships and crew.Japan at this point hadnt seen a real war in well over a hundred years. Their coastal defenses were in major disrepair and their commanders were lacking practical experience. The problem is made worse by the fact that the Americans arrived early.Perry returns for the final answer. In OTL the Japanese had conceded to the Americans demands. In this ATL the new Shogun is adamant to reject the trade requests. Upon entering Edo Bay the Shogun orders the American ships to be fired on immediately.Many of the Japanese cannons fail to fire and the ones that do are designs from the th century so they do minimal damage. The Japanese also send out coastal skiffs to attempt boarding actions on the Americans.Perry orders counter battery and defensive action. The Americans repel the skiffs but there is no point in remaining under fire so a tactical retreat is ordered. Although they got away relatively easy the fleet took minimal damage and two vessels were nearly crippled.Over the following months Perry makes his way back to the mainland US and reports on the incident. The Japanese aggression is largely exaggerated and Congress believes it to be an act of war. They authorize an invasion involving a total of  Soldiers and several top of the line vessels.The Fleet reaches Japan by August .  Soldiers split off from the main Fleet to capture the Ryukyu Islands and raidblockade shipping routs from Nagasaki and Southern Japan. This mission proved very successful and the Ryukyu Islands submitted almost without a fight.The main push forced a landing a few miles south of Edo Bay. With cover from coastal bombardment they march to Edo where the Shogun resides.The Shogun has assembled a force of  sworn Samurai. Many with outdated Matchlocks and inexperienced in Melee combat. The boy Shogun is incapable of leading the men personally due to his age. His advisers upon seeing the outnumbered American force urge the boy to  permit them to take the field. Although the advisers genuinely thought they could defeat the Americans they were more concerned with garnering personal glory.The following battle is a bloodbath on the Japanese side. Inexperienced leaders poorly organize their troops into outdated combat formations. The Japanese Commanders order attack after attack. All ending in disaster. Eventually they retreat back to the city defeated.The American force captures the city and the Shogun. Many of the advisers commit suicide however the child Shogun himself hesitates which leads to his captivity.The Americans expect the conflict to be as good as done. They have the leader of Japan and believe they can now strong arm the Daimyos into submission. In fact the opposite is true. In the code of honor for the time the boy should have committed Seppuku. For the Lords of Japan this is an outrage to their national honor and integrity.The war wages on for  more years. The Daimyos rally together and bitterly resist the Americans. While the US pours in more men and resources to the conflict. Unwilling to yield to the Japanese as such a defeat will reflect poorly on the international stage.The opening battles largely favored the Americans. Superior firepower and tactics afforded them relatively easy victories. Eventually Japanese leadership grew more cunning and learned to properly use their numbers to overwhelm American firepower. However victories were still extremely costly and didnt afford much traction to the overall war.By  Japanese Lords began independently signing contracts with British French and Russian traders in order to gain access to new technologies. They also hired European mercenaries to fight the Americans.Late in  the war grew to a stalemate. The USA controlled Edo and the surrounding area the Ryukyu Islands shikoku and part of Kyushu While the Japanese still held sovereignty over most of the country.The American public had grown tired of fighting in some far off nation they hardly knew existed while the Japanese began to lose hope that they could ever take back the entire country. Since by this point trade had already been opened up to Europe they also saw little reason to still be fighting aside from spite. It took a few months of negotiations but peace prevailed.The US will abandon their holdings in exchange for very favorable trade conditions. In addition Nagasaki the Ryukyus and several other Islands will be leased to the USA to be administrated by their government.The Americans withdraw over the course of a year and return the formerly imprisoned Shogun. Who is swiftly beheaded by the Japanese lords for his cowardice. Although they have their peace it lasts a mere months as the remaining Daimyos pursue a savage power struggle. Japan breaks up into regions and a large scale civil war is born out of the power vacuum. It lasts  bloody years until one faction unites them all. It styles itself a Republic although the actual Democracy is much more inclusive to the rich and powerful leaving out the peasant class. The Nobility get voting rights and are able to choose representatives to go to Edo and vote in favor of their Region.The Confederation of Japan modernizes over the remaining th century. A few decades of peace serve them well and allow for decent economic development. Meanwhile the  Japanese American war postponed the American civil war until the s where the Union still eventually won out.However Japan will  fight another war with America known as the Pacific War. Started as a result of the US intervention in the Cuban war of independence. Spain knew the Japanese were still bitter so they appealed to them for help.Spain still lost in the Caribbean. However the Confederation of Japan managed to put Nagasaki Ryukyu and all other Japanese Islands back in Japanese control while Spain managed a tenuous hold on the Philippines.,HistoryWhatIf,d53xxk0,4,t5_35koa

9970614,0,t3_5ibeww,Honestly Im not sure if much at all changes.  Caesars still gonna Caesar and while Cicero was a master orator he still wouldnt have persuaded Cato et al to support the obvious threat that Caesar presented.  Pompey by that time was too busy shacking up with his young wife Caesars daughter Julia who apparently loved each other sincerely to be bothered to do too much at that point.  He was by that time the most powerful man in Rome likely the most popular was a legendary general super wealthy and wanting for nothing. Really at this point his only goal in politics was to get his soldiers the land and money he promised to them on their campaigns through the East.  Not really sure what Cicero could do to alter this.Lastly we have the morally bankrupt Crassus who for all of his real estate prospecting and fire fighting profiteering reeeeeeeeaaallllyyyy wanted a military victory to cement his legacy as a Great Man of the Roman Republic.  He was totally jobbed by Pompey on the whole Sparticusled slave revolt when he did the heavy lifting just in time for Pompey to clean up the crumbs and claim victory.  So he was very motivated to secure his own military success which is what led him to the illfated Battle of Carrhae.  Not sure what Cicero would have been able to do here either.Now thats not to say there would have been zero difference Cicero would likely have been able to keep the three men together for longer than they were.  But he wouldnt have kept Crassus from his Persian invasion and he wouldnt have prevented the death of Julia which was the final nail in the coffin of the PompeyCaesar partnership and for all his skills of persuasion he wouldnt likely have budged the stickinthemud that was Cato the Younger and the large part of the Senate he led in the SenateCaesar civil war.I want to end with the disclaimer that I am not a historian and this is my personal opinion which could easily be based off of incorrect information and lack of understanding of this period of Rome.,HistoryWhatIf,db774yh,2,t5_35koa

10175945,0,t3_5loc7a,From what I understand that was what Hitler wanted.So what would that mean? Britain would no longer blockade Europe. The North African Campaign would not have happened. Therefore Italy would have retained Libya and Ethiopia and may have then had the resources to be successful against Greece perhaps. Germany would then have been able to import more resources such as oil and rubber etc. With that and the absence of distractions of various side shows Operation Barbarossa may have been even more destructive.The interesting thing is where would that leave Britain in the Pacific war? Would they have been compelled to give up Singapore Australia and New Zealand to the Japanese under the terms of the treaty. At that time these countries felt bound to Great Britain. It was only World War Two that caused Australias focus to change towards the United States. Would Britain be permitted to fight against the Japanese in the defence of India? Would it have meant the loss of so many interests overseas?On the upside. They would not have been bankrupted a second time in thirty years. The USA would have had only the Pacific War to wage or would they have come to an agreement with Germany also. There is money in selling arms to a war zone. No one knew about the Holocaust at this point.As for Japan could Germanys influence have prevented the circumstances leading to Pearl Harbour. Therefore leaving Japan with the manpower to conquer China SouthEast Asia and Australia enabling it to gain the resources that it so desperately needed for its economy.Would have been a different world. Not one I would have existed in. My father would not have met my mother. I would not be born. It scares me to think of societies controlled by a Nazi ethos or that of a Bushido culture. It reminds me somewhat of descriptions of the ancient Assyrian cuklture. Awful.Eventually I think both of them would have turned their eyes to the Americas.

11096210,0,t3_5yfb9e,So the question is basically What if Nazi Germany focused more on their Navy?Well one thing is that they may not have been able to Blitzkrieg Poland or France. Germany needed a lot of tanks and mechanization to pull off the rapid invasions early in the war.I can see the invasion of Poland happening about just as quick because with the Russians invading from the east the Poles were screwed anyways. However France is a much tougher target. If Germany cant push through France then its going to become a war of attrition. Which Germany may still win but it could take years. If the USSR or USA get involved midway through the Germans are totally fucked.If the Nazis can capture France relatively quickly then their Navy might play a huge role. Instead of going off to invade Russia they can sit tight and try to strangle Britain. First by cutting off forces from North Africa but also blockading the home isles. If the Nazis stopped building tanks and put resources towards landing craft they might actually be able to invade a starved UK by late . The issue is that so much could go wrong. Whether it be the USSR joining in or the USA. Either of which would ruin any planned invasion of Britain.,HistoryWhatIf,depquty,8,t5_35koa

11313867,0,t1_dfdxe5i,It would certainly be different but I dont think earlier state centralization would necessarily be a bad thing.  I think Hamiltons strong advocation for force to put down the Whiskey Rebellion of  for example was the right call.  As the song goes Pay your motherfucking taxes!. The earlier creation of a Federal military isnt a bad thing.  Hamilton being Anglophile also means hes unlikely to be lead into a disastrous invasion of Canada as Madison was.  While Hamilton obviously coveted the Carribean I doubt that Britain would have allowed any annexation of French or Spanish island territory at this point.  He would likely have invaded and annexed the Louisiana Territory rather than purchase it as Jefferson did.  One interesting issue would be the legality of slavery in the former Louisiana territories.  I would speculate that Hamilton a staunch abolitionist would have used his executive authority to keep the importation of slaves into the Territory illegal.  In OTL the Missouri Compromise of  keeps the balance between free states and slave states.  By keeping these territories free of slavery Hamilton would set the stage for the entire West to join as Free States.  Given this we might even see an earlier Civil War and an earlier end to slavery in the US.,HistoryWhatIf,dfeeqcn,9,t5_35koa

They are better off in the sense that most Native Americans dont die of disease but not necessarily better off economically.gt Would The USA still exist?The USA almost certainly wouldnt exist.gt Do they hold onto more of their own culture? Yes Native culture will remain the dominant culture in the New World.gt What sort of countries form?Much smaller less developed less politically stable and more warfare. Mostly third world in nature. There will almost certainly be outliers though who are much more successful than the majority.gt How does this affect the rest of the world?Hard to say. Europe will likely produce a larger percentage of the worlds GDP given that North America is less developed. Without a USA to meet the demands of a global market Europe will have to fulfill the supply as one of the only continents capable of producing advanced high quality goods like cars computers planes etc... So European hegemony over the world will last longer.

11693993,0,t3_66rs5q,gthow could Germany win against America?With Europe under their control winning a war against America would be a far more monumental task than anything ever done by Germany before. Invading the Soviet Union would be easier by several orders of magnitude.First Germany needs a massive mechanized Army much better equipped than what they had waltzing across Europe in . They need lots of trucks lots of tanks and all the other armored vehicles that would be good to have selfpropelled guns halftrucks tank destroyers armored cars amphibious vehicles kubelwagens etc.. Considering Germany just defeated Britain and France the US will almost certainly be rearming and solidifying its allies within North and South America most of all Mexico and Canada which now hosts the British Government in Exile.Next they need a huge Navy. Unlike Britain France and Russia America has an entire ocean between it and Germany and Germany will need many ships to transport its vast armies across the Atlantic to land in the Americas. Furthermore Germany cannot hope to win the war at sea using just Uboats they will need many more combat vessels including Battleships Destroyers Frigates and most importantly Aircraft Carriers. It will take years for the German Navy to build up enough strength for this task even with German war production at full strength.Then theres the Air Force. Whereas having a powerful Air Force was not too important over the Soviet Union due to the different environment Germany will need a vast and powerful Air Force if they hope to gain any meaningful ground within North America. Even with Aircraft Carriers Germany will need to capture several islands in the Caribbean so they can use heavy transports and bombers and they will need to develop longrange heavy bombers and transports for this. In the skies over America Germany will need longrange fighters so these bombers and transports do not get shot down.Now of course Germany will be worried about Americas West Coast as well so here they will need to coordinate with Japan. To make this much easier Germany will need a direct overland link to Japan which means that Germany will need to control most of Western Russia and Japan will need to control significantly more of Eastern China. Japan will need to be convinced to launch a secondary invasion of North America on its Western Coast which means they will need to launch their islands campaign remove Australia as a threat and capture the huge American military installation in Hawaii. Every step of the way Germany will need to be more active in helping Japan consolidate its gains in the Pacific so the USCanada and maybe Mexico as well are more cornered as Japan will never have enough resources to be able to launch such an enormous offensive on its own.Japan and Germany invading North America will doubtless be the costliest bloodiest military endeavor ever attempted the GermanJapanese landings would be many times more complicated than Dday and the end result is highly likely to be a complete and total failure for the Axis in the off event it is not it becomes so costly for Axis troops that popular sentiment in Germany and Japan turn against the war and the offensive is abandoned after some time.Not to mention that Germany and Japan would go bankrupt before they ever set foot on North American soil because of all the money their governments had to spend in order to get ready for this offensive.So the less costly but far longer option is to put money into nuclear weapons research to intimidate America and covertly fund fascist political parties within the countries of North and South America to slowly turn these countries in favor of Germany and Japan. Maybe wage some economic warfare too to speed things up a bit. But they would have to stabilize their economies in order to do all that because the economies they used to sustain their regimes were unsustainable in the long term not to mention they would still need to spend money dealing with the numerous guerilla wars in territory they already control so chances are the Nazis and Japans militarist regime would collapse from internal pressure long before the USCanada would budge.gtConversely how could America liberate not only France as well as the U.K.?They probably will not be able to do this either so they will have to wait for the Nazi state to collapse which it will inevitably due to overextension.,HistoryWhatIf,dglj6b1,1,t5_35koa
