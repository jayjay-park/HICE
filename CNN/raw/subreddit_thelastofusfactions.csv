Some things you might not notice because the game rounds your points to the nearest  always rounded up.  for example lets say you use first aid training .  Normally each heal gives you  pts.  If you have collector  that is  pts however the game rounds up to  pts.  Now if you put on collector  its now calculated to  pts.  This is still rounded up to  pts. technically its shown in game as  pts and then  pts but you get the point.

Use the rest on ammo and armor. By midgame I have armor a full chamber and  rounds extra. I have more parts than I can spend. Once you get your aim up youll win a lot of firefights.

716337,0,t3_22cdlo,Ive always thought some sort of attackdefend mode would be great. Some of the most intense exchanges for me are when one team is defending the safe in interrogation. One team defends a certain area while the other plans to infiltrate and take over then try to hold it down. Particulars that come to mind are the center area in Damn the lodge in Lakeside the house in Downtown. Could be fun..

I try to stay outside that zone if possible. They wont hear you if youre far away. I prefer the area between medium and long range. Close enough to see a lot of their head yet far enough that dodging bullets is fairly easy. Also it requires crouch walking. I try to stay very mobile and crouch walking makes that more difficult.

Hes really into Skylanders right now as are most kids his age. That business model is genius! Him and his younger brother Jake   yrs old play that and NSMB together a lot. Its especially funny when they play NSMB. DJ will help Jake. It gets good when DJ has a yoshi. Hell eat Jake and carry him through the level so he doesnt have to wait Jake hasnt discovered run yet.

1592025,0,t3_2cibxy,Couple of things from the top of my head                                                                                                The bow has a unique crosshair it shows the trajectory of the arrow with a circle on the end. If the circle is open youll miss your shot. If the circle is white its a hit. Aiming with the bow takes some time to get used to so the best advice I can give is to keep using it until youre familiar with it.                                                     Flanking enemies is probably the best way to get bow kills. The fact that its silent means theyll probably be downed before they know where the arrows come from.                                                                              Learn to corner shoot. There are a few videos that explain in detail how to do this but in theory it means sticking to a corner and aim the bow around it either standing or crouching. It will enable you to shoot at people whereas they can only hit your arm making them an easy target and you a hard target.             The aiming with the bow also works in the fog of a smoke bomb. So what Ive said earlier about the circle being open or white is also the case in the fog. So if you know someone is in the fog scan the area with your crosshair. If the circles white fire the arrow!                                                                                            Headshots are a one hit down. and very satisfying                                                                                Once youre more familiar with the bow dont be afraid of frontal confrontations. Some people here say that a bow wont win a v firefight against another weapon but thats not true. If your aim is good you will win that firefight. a good strategy is to take cover shoot an arrow take cover again shoot again... aka taking potshots.                                                                                                                                          Aiming with the bow for too long will cause a wobble effect. If this happens its best to stop aiming and aim again to refresh your aim. Accuracy is key with the bow. You dont want that wobble intervering with it.                                                                                               Thats all I got so far. Good luck the bow.

1592867,0,t1_cjfqab6,God I fucking hate the welfare system in this game. Yeah sure in a lobby full of randoms its not that big of a deal but in a competitive game its so fucking annoying because the other teams know how to utilize it. I cant even count how many times people have made or almost made comebacks from just spamming mollies bombs shotguns etc. And some maps are so so much fucking worse with this than others. Checkpoint for example is horrible for welfare because youll always be in close encounters making avoiding molotovs impossible. Unlike lakeside where at least youll always be a good distance away. I dont care what anyone says welfare needs to be adjusted. I dont see who would defend being punished for doing well. Its not even a small dent like the other team gets extra parts they get a  parts a x and a fucking bomb or Molotov  like every box. How is my burst going to compete with that? Youre in close range? Heres my x. Youre taking cover? Heres a fucking Molly. We get into a gunfight? Sorry man armor all day. Just spawned? Well heres a minefield full of bombs.

When someone gets down it means that the other team has to go for a revive meaning that  players now are incapable of combat.

The FT takes so long to kill that I some times get executed before Ive killed the other guy they still burn afterwards but its some serious bull!. The shot gun on the other hand is instant and can actually hit a moving target its really easy to just out run the FT and make it useless. The shot gun is also superior in range while best in cqc it can unlike the FT hit someone whos not within arms length. I feel like the FT is fun to use but ends up being outclassed in every way. The Double barrel is cheaper the shot gun is better over all for a cqc weapon and for a silenced weapon it depends how much you want to spend.,thelastofusfactions,ckzdtt3,1,t5_2xkws

I will comment because this video shows how easy it is to dominate with the burst rifle especially overkill when using it with scavenger sharpshooter . Watching someone inflict  damage bodyshots with the hunting rifle would be just as skillful and compelling which is clearly sarcasm if you didnt get it this video has no extraordinary moments average for anyone using the burst rifle against randoms anyone that isnt completely incompetent. These are guns you use to win tryhard guns not make entertaining videos with. In fact one of the more interesting clips in the video is the player himself going down in one burst  then revived  and killing that player solely because they ran out of burst rifle ammo.

2532961,0,t3_2onwxh,Just to clarify...There is a THWACK! sound which is the Hit Marker.  It will give this sound any time an enemy is either directly hit by the throwable ANDOR if its resulting explosion injures an enemy.  This Hit marker will be louder when it downsexecutes an enemy and will give a MultiTHWACK if you downex more than one.  The Hit Marker will sound for a Smoke Bomb hitting an alreadydowned enemy so be aware!There is a CLICK sound that occurs when you toggle via DPad or go through and select menu items.There is a Tick sound much softer than the above that occurs each time a Scoring Notification appears.And of course there is the CLICKHISS indicating that a bombs fuse is burning.To which of these was the OP referring??I wonder..GL!TP,thelastofusfactions,cmp7074,2,t5_2xkws

2723196,0,t1_cndhl2i,I was in the same camp then forced myself to use it via Missions.The first hurdle to overcome for me was the pace and fire rate of the bursts.  The shot aspect allows for a little more mindfulness between bursts and also allows for midburst drag shots.For HU battles preaim is key.  But regardless of whether youre in their crosshairs or sneaking up on them hitting the first burst is key.  The delay between bursts can cost your life.  If you can take the time to set it up try to get a headshot in your first burst.The reticule is quite small and the L Pullaway Single Shot PS can give some real Headaches for enemies.  Even without this it is one of the most versatile weapons available.But one thing Ill also say is that my skills overall needed to develop more before the BR could be used more effectively.Dont give up on the BR...  In the right hands it can be The Beast Rifle!!GL!TP,thelastofusfactions,cndm6g3,2,t5_2xkws

Its not always about the win and given they were getting bust up most of the game indicates that on the day they just werent as good a team. So the opportunity was given for a clean rematch of which they proved once again to be a poor team by rage quitting.

2989684,0,t1_co7i8h4,Various loadouts but the best combos are CBSAR CBRevolver and xmmCB. Those take the enemy to very low health so they bleed out very quickly. I think the xmm actually works the best because it takes out about  health making the bleed out  seconds. However because it gets so close you need to land the  shots first because otherwise if you hit with CB first and then try to hit xmm your shots themselves may down the enemy then you dont get the  bonus parts for the bleed out. SAR and Revolver have almost identical damage and I think takes out about  health when comboed so the bleed out is  seconds. Thats ample time for good players to immediately start healing. While getting hit with xmm is less of an urgent heal so not everyone will immediately heal but then when you hit them with the CB they have only  seconds to react. Trickier though to go for xmmCB but VERY effective.My goal is to conserve CB bolts while earning the  bonus parts.,thelastofusfactions,co7vmgj,1,t5_2xkws

3183224,0,t3_2wl1hm,dont forget you only need agility  with se to have that fast listen mode. One of my favorite loadouts ever was the bow milly covert sharp ears  and agility . You can now silence your  milly in exchange for covert  but all in all you just are always able to position yourself perfectly for flanks and always have the upper hand....not in power though of course with the bow and milly but ogs get it done every time with that combo,thelastofusfactions,corxvoa,2,t5_2xkws
3187789,0,t3_2wml55,I love Interrogation because the tactical dynamics change during the game  and I love how you can comeback from being    down on interrogations. at first everyones cautious trying not to give up the interrogations then  when one team has all   it changes as you see the team thats behind taking more risks as they no longer have any interrogations to give up  plus the defending team knows exactly where the other team is heading. Often one idiot breaks off from the main team and gets his a interrogated after a while its all square  interrogations each and the dynamics change again as your team decides who goes on the attack and who sits back  the more you send the better the chance of opening the safe  but the more vulnerable your own safe!

3246977,0,t3_2x9j7h,Ive ran nothing but bow load outs since day  and my favorite is definitelyCovert Agility Silenced  milly and dat bow doughThe best way to describe this loadout would definitely be  . Its simplicity is so freeing to take on any situation in any way. Once the  milly became one LP to silence my dreams came true for this class to be possible. Being fully silenced is definitely fun as hell but the best part is that this class has only one focus be good at the core game mechanics. Once you learn the ancient masters ways of the  millys cadence and the bows drag shot and head shot powers you can compete and win reliably against any dam gun especially if you get the first shot of course except the burst and shotgun honestly I think the burst is even more unreasonable than the shotgun. A one burst down and execution is not kosher. I believe its the hardest legitament loadout to run but also think it has crazy potential in the right hands.  ,thelastofusfactions,coyk2xy,2,t5_2xkws

3413236,0,t3_2zaf0g,If I remember correctly they said previously that the PS will remain to be split up because if they do what theyve done on the PS people wouldnt be able to play Factions that dont have both sets of DLC since PS users still have to buy them. I was hosting a party and tried to join the DLC  lobby but not everybody in the party had the appropriate DLC so it wouldnt let us go. Itd be the same thing if they split it up and made it like the PS version. Whether you tried to play NP or Parties if you didnt have both DLC you wouldnt be able to play. With Remastered you get all the maps so theres no problem but itd create a big problem with PS factions so the PS version will always have the separate pools. Ive wondered why they wouldnt just make a Parties and NP options for the DLC and DLC  pools but ND commented on that and said the Factions community for PS is already pretty limited and they dont wanna split it up even more.,thelastofusfactions,cphc0tm,1,t5_2xkws

3689395,0,t3_32mvka,First of all I do not agree that the welfare concept is dumb. Could it be implemented better? Yes. But sometimes you are getting fucked up the ass by the other team for  straight minutes and you just need a bomb and x to get your mojo back. The welfare system is there to prevent total massacres  which still happen by the way because if the enemy team is truly good then no amount of bombs and molotovs can save you.Now heres a tip to deal with welfare Try denying the boxes. You know that you are not going to get anything from the st box and the enemy is rushing to boxes to get their welfare supplies so start a gunfight before it becomes a throwable fight. Welfare only works if you can  get to the box and  craft your stuff.TLDR Skip your own boxes and try to kill them while they have their backpacks open.,thelastofusfactions,cqctd9w,6,t5_2xkws

Other than that the BR is countered by all the same things but its harder to catch a shorty user since they simply pop shot or strafe dance and down you in  NEAR  GUARANTEED body hits. The fact that you so vehemently defend the Shorty is truly sad. Youre one of the reasons why new Factions players dont like the game.

Even when you make the same move in the exact same situation against another player you may get a negative result vs your previous win. In poker we shrug and say well...thats poker.  The same could be said about TLOU. Maybe thats why I love both.  The balance strategic thought amp ideas versus a run amp gun multiplayer. There are a ton of better TLOU players than I am but when I play against one I think  how can I expose a weakness or trap them.  Get them to make a mistake amp capitalize on it.  Nice post bud amp Good Luck.,thelastofusfactions,ctdzzl3,1,t5_2xkws

I just think you could chose your words more carefully and still educate others as to why you disagree or dislike something without sounding like a dick.  But you and I have danced this dance before so Im just going to say thanks because somewhere in your last reply there was a hint of a compliment DI dont take anything personally buddy Im a light hearted guy but I cant display that in text speech.  I just always try to reply to peoples comments.  And like you I speak my mind about it and enjoy engaging with other TLOU players in any context.  If that makes me sensitive well Ill whack on a chick flick and eat some chocolate.Im not trying to make excuses for the video and if I need to stand up for my actions I will.  Watching it back I can see why it comes across that way and maybe the words I used and scenes I chose should have been different.  I dont stress to be perfect by any means but it wasnt my intention to show people so that they can go do it.  Merely to show thats where the glitch is when theyre being constantly downed without a clue of whats happening. I appreciate that by viewing this people who werent aware of it will more than likely attempt it.  But for me nearly every time Ive played Coal Mine recently particularly on Supply Raid someone has been doing this.  So and Im in the UK so it maybe different if youre not the map has become unplayable when Im on already.I want it patched as quick as possible and exposing it in my opinion is the best way to get that done.

4912368,0,t3_3i6f0d,I am going to make My list in no specific order of favorites and just a description based on My experience with these players. I am pretty much going to name those I have played with often and My friends.Gotta say nice things about My friends for once.. Assassin He has no mic but He makes up for it in his amazing bow skill. I have seen him destroy burst rifles and tactical shotguns head up with the bow loads of times. Along with that He knows what He is doing when it comes to teamwork.. IvanHuerta Just all around friendly talkative and funny. It is funny to hear him rage as well.. EXELIS Great team player and good with communication. His accent is also amazing. . KarmaticAssassin Very skilled with the bow and hunting rifle and also very coordinated. He is very good at dodging your shots as well. He makes agility  OP.. TanvirBhulcrap Team player and He is very reasonable. Also has a good attitude and doesnt get mad at all.. DRKANGEL The self proclaimed scrub rekker of TLOU. If you go over to the facebook groups you will find him there commenting on post rooting out and calling out all the scrubbery. He has the skills to make up for his talk. He is amazing at pulling off Headshots with everything. . DirtyMercy I have played with him for a long time over a year. He is good at communication and all around fun to play with.. NoNoobsNeeded I have also played with him for a while also. He is a really good sniper but he comboes with a revolver if He misses a headshot which he gets lots of. He is hilarious as well and never swears....ever.. ETOUCH Okay Dirty Noobsand ET were my running crew for a while. I can almost consider them real life friends. I have had so many great times with the  of them. ET added that extra flair to our little group. He rages just like me and He talk a lot. But this makes the game more fun.. BobbyBarks Just an awesome character He is. Nice friendly and calm. We need more people like him in this game. also BobbyBarksBank.. angelknivesellie THE BEST MEDIC IN TLOU. No ifs ands or buts. She always has heals and goes out of her way to heal you. She has saved Me and my team countless times. She is also pretty good with the hunting rifle as well.. CursedByBeauty Its Justin. A one of a kind awesome friendly talkative and sincere person. He is a shorty scrub but we love you Justin.. Stokens Guy is a monster at this game. His aim is just precise and spot on. He remains consistent with his aim as well. He is also very nice funny and smart as well when you get to talking to Him.. Reo AKA TLOU Fun Really nice guy and fun to play with. I love that New Zelander accent as well..Valk OHHHHHH Man........He is one of a kind. No one on Earth is like this legend. I am pretty much going to say what has been said about this Man that many others have said. I will leave it at that.. looklook I think he is easily one of the to snipers in the game. Thats just my opinion. He is a nice guy as well once you get to talking to him.. Providang Really nice and outgoing. She always runs reviver  as Vorlo stated above. I LOVE REVIVER !!!. PossumThePossum He is always streaming and dedicated to TLOU. He also runs reviver  a lot as well.. NickA You are just an awesome guy and player. Nuff said.. Ethereal Just an amazing player when he played. He was good with the burst and hunting rifle. He had a unique playstyle of just moving around really quick. He was also good at shiv dancing shotguns. He doesnt play anymore though.. SanchoWest Because He is SanchoWest.. LudicrouslyLiam mm king of TLOU I think. I just loved watching his gameplay..Swifty Before He moved onto where ever He went He was my favorite TLOU Youtuber. He has some of my favorite TLOU videos as well.. ProjectsUnknown Your a monster at this game. Nuff said.. Akyenemi Stays calm and relaxed. He doesnt get mad. He uses his mic to communicate and is amazing with the hunting Rifle.   Well this was my personal list. Dons be all antsy or whatever.This was just My opinions.,thelastofusfactions,cudqo5v,7,t5_2xkws

9277434,0,t1_d8o2dtj,A tip that has worked for me Unless your team is down by a couple of rounds dont waste your time with the loot boxes at least at first. Instead to get an edge on the enemy sprint to a good hiding place near the middle of the map and wait for the unsuspecting tourist to waltz right into your trap DAlso covert training  is very useful as you will always start with a shiv which you can use as an instant kill from behind and you will not show up to the enemy in listen mode R while youre crouch walking.

You might want to look at increasing your bitrate.Quality aside Id be more concerned with the composition of your thumbnail because some of the text is illegible when viewed at less than . And that was on a PC monitor imagine trying to read it on a mobile phone screen.In my opinion making sure the thumbnail is perfect at  is far more important than how it looks at full size.ampnbspDo you mean Kbps? For p  fps thats definitely going to be the reason youre getting a lot of graininess. Youre not giving your encoder sufficient bandwidth to cope with the movement in your videos.YouTube has a guide on bitrates here. It suggests Mbps for p but that would be assuming a frame rate of fps. Because youre doing fps you should experiment with doubling that possibly  if not at least  more meaning an average bitrate of Mbps or Kbps for VBR in OBS.It would be worthwhile setting aside a good  minutes to do some test records and watch the resulting encodes. Pay close attention to where the most movement is in the playback.,thelastofusfactions,d9qx65j,1,t5_2xkws

10107449,0,t1_dboxspf,Anything can sound cool at first glance but delve deeper into it and analyze it to see what the potential is. They could change values but which ones? Would suddenly being surrounded by Infected bring tension or frustration from either losing the round or valuable ammo and items? Would a dramatically larger map strain on the pingmemory of most users or even the capacity of the system like what happened with the PS I know the PS has better specs but this is hypothetical? Most developers want criticisms and critical analysis of their works and both positive and negative perspectives. It wouldnt surprise me if people wanted this mode but how would the rest of the community respond? Would this new mode be good for the game or would it be wasted resources to try to appeal to a new audience despite it being critically acclaimed and being one of the best games of all time?

Offensive executions get you more parts so you have to actually execute them near their box. Also if your mate goes down and you know an enemy is near bait your downed mate and stop the interrogation while it is happening. You get extra parts for that too.
