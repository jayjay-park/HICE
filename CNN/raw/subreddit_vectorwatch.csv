6810871,0,t1_d0o7c0a,Well doing the process from the above link worked.  This is very frustrating.  I really wish Vector had more resources to better address things like this.  Email support apparently is not enough and needless to say when people get the update automatically on their phones I have a feeling there are going to be a lot of people having similar issues.  Anyhow this link worked perfectly!  Lets hope Vector fixes these issues soon! Side note I really dislike the way the streams now.  The scrolling is nuts.  I had to change around how I place my streams because Even the Events stream now scrolls when it is displaying something static like No Events  at least on the watch face I am using.  I think for the Events Stream they should drop that bell icon.  So my watch goes between Bell icon No Event to No Events with the scrolling.,vectorwatch,d0ob58l,1,t5_3aj31

9951201,0,t1_db4nxzc,I work for a business that runs a lot of servers  Im mostly amused as long as its sorted by morning. EDIT I was once on a conference call sorting out a server issue for thirty six hours straight. Ill give them that much of a window before I really start to get cranky.,vectorwatch,db4o153,1,t5_3aj31
9971247,0,t3_5icgl8,I always interpreted currently as hope. But dont buy it if your absolute determination to own it is based on this. Im not happy about not being able to control the music in file explorer.,vectorwatch,db7a3v4,1,t5_3aj31
10312927,0,t1_dccwm7r,Thanks! idk why some streams dont show up after publishing. They look like empty spaces.,vectorwatch,dcd0ysn,1,t5_3aj31
10328791,0,t1_dcelitx,Not yet but I rolled it back and did some more work before a new submit. But Ill submit very soon again.A share page would be great as suggested.Best would be if the development portal allowed cloning of watch faces but they had reasons not to allow that. If I could have a share only version and a submit version that would be great. But thats not the way it is.,vectorwatch,dcetrai,1,t5_3aj31
10414987,0,t3_5p3jwy,One trick I have done on my android is to turn off the battery optimization for the Vector app in your battery settings.  Helps with delayed notifications when the phone goes into doze.  Not sure if it works or not but I have not had any issues with missed notifications!,vectorwatch,dcolup3,2,t5_3aj31
