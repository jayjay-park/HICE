To dress that up a bit if its involuntary Duchenne laughter then by definition theres no cause to think its something you can or ought to change. If its voluntary laughter when you decide to laugh nonDuchenne then oughts may come into play. You can never revert back from C to A because you already have the information that B provided. So a revert back to an older style of comedy will be informed by the information provided by postmodern comedy metacomedy anticomedy hipster shit. Wes Anderson is a great example. His actors deadpan their comic delivery while speaking Meta talking very intelligently about their emotions instead of just feeling them. Parks amp Rec on the other hand seems to actually make an attempt at reverting back to a Cheersstyle sense of humor. No commenting on comedy. And Im not sure it works that well. Some of the time it does sure but it frequently falls prey to Everybody Love Raymond Syndrome just lights hitting your eyes. The stakes arent high enough usually for us to give an equal and opposite laugh. Seth Rogen movies are at the pinacle of the inverse. They use time as their ally the tension being built with the absurdity of spending so much time on such little bickering Peter Griffith does it all the time like the hittinghisknee gag aaaarrgh.... aaaaaaaaaaaaargh. Its a tight balancing act and it doesnt really pay off in his more recent movies. It would never work on say SNL anymore where youve got  minutes to build a universe and tell your jokes. It did in the s with Will Ferrell though the family dinner table bit.Any move toward New Sincerity I think wont be a reaction to the sheer confusion of sorting through all the fruitless layers of irony that go into metahumor. I think it will be boredom with the whole process. I want to see someone genuinely put themselves out there have something genuinely at stake. Im no longer impressed by movies that have the balls to waste time. It doesnt take balls anymore its the norm. The tensions gone. I could see a Leslie Nielson figure making a comeback. The Naked Gun and  I bunch them together in my head is one of my ten favorite movies of all time and its very much due to Nielsons acting performance. When he says Jane youre hurting me! or Any last requests? Ah... give me... the gun? Ohhh no. Not gonna fall for that thats taking the situation incredibly seriously. It matters to the characters that theyre being hurt or about to die. So while I could see that style of comedy making a comeback the screwball jokeasecond frame it was in may not. The pathway to getting comedy on that new path seems to me will be through genre hybridization. Space comedies thrillers westerns etc. Naked Gun was a police procedural. The Interview was one of the biggest letdowns ever for me precisely because it worked in such a great frame interviewing and killing the dictator of North Korea. I did a review on it a while back that unwittingly ties in to what youre saying. Had they cut out all their bullshit and believed that they were in the universe they had built we couldve had another Young Frankenstein. But until people start taking these premises seriously Id say its further down the rabbit hole of irony for a while. Edit Im an idiot. Informant  Interview,Humorists,d08hlaz,2,t5_3cmo2
