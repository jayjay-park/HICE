8832616,0,t3_5160xy,I feel it is a vocal minority and every phone has problems but it will all depend on whether this is the phone that LG ups their quality assurance or it will just be another iffy phone from them.

Only way I found out about it was from XDA. I asked most of my friends of they knew about the v which to no surprise they did not.So bull shit on marketing making no difference.

9518374,0,t3_58ztxn,I am so upset right now.  Yesterday midvideo my camera glass shattered while being used.  I did not hit anything or set it down it was being held in my hand.  The phone has a clear TPU case to prevent the camera lens from contacting a deskhard surface.Here is the video I was recording at the time please forgive me for the volumelanguage it is in an automotive shop.Here is how the lens looks now  Video is extremely blurry and glass has been falling out of the phone.  Im guessing the optical image stabilization is fubard.I contacted TMobile customer support and my store and both said it is physical damage and I am SOL.I contact LG customer support and was told to create a repair request but the warranty will likely be void as it is physical damage. ltlt Transcript Link.Im not sure what else to do but send the phone off and wait for over a week without a device to find out they probably wont cover it. gtltAny suggestions?,lgv20,d9mcc01,14,t5_3cqek

9701641,0,t3_5dxpy2,LG does have a common issue with glass breaking and people who havent had it yet to them love to claim to that its not a common issue when in fact its not a bad batch thats a load of shit. As I have five friends all have had the problem with the G and V and now I feel bad because I convinced them to get the LG phones which I still believe are the best on the market regardless its just annoying to have to deal with. Anyway to prove a point i have had my G glass replaced four times. First time was a drop yes. The other three times was in a Otterbox case and a spigen case as I wanted to see if it was case based and it wasnt and it broke again and again. I used my phone to record a video with the flash and it broke.  Third time it broke from just taking pictures all day. Never left my hand and it broke. My good friend got a V last week and his broke in a case never dropped. How could this be a bad batch? Anyway dont listen to this people claiming its not a problem as it clearly is. LG had a plan called the one charge or flate plan and will fix all problems with your phone with a  day warranty that was my best route but it costs . Canadian. Not sure in the states. Most places do not have the glass for the camera lens yet and will source most likely via eBay so be careful with that as eBay ones I hear dont let u take clear photos.,lgv20,da8xnk6,3,t5_3cqek

I send out emails from my phone every morning and spend  solid minutes on the device. My g would lose nearly  battery with the screen on  brightness and WiFi off. The V so far only loses maybe . With brightness a little higher and WiFi on.  hours into my day right now and Im at  but I played Pokemon go for about  minutes. My g cant do Pokemon without being plugged in to the charger. It would take  of the battery for about every  minutes of play. I still had  battery by pm last night with heavy usage.  hours of back to back phone calls games emails web browsing etc. Im not blown away by the camera which is a bummer but its not horrible by any means. I need to play with the manual settings a little and see how those do. I love the second screen. I never thought I wanted it. But its so handy and not obnoxiously in the way like Samsung Edge.
