409378,0,t1_cfn0y5c,My home in Aspen Hill has a Silver Spring address with the  zipcode.   is about the northernmost extent of places with Silver Spring addresses.  Go west of Georgia and Connecticut Avenues and you enter  which gets the Rockville designation.  North of Norbeck Road you enter  which gets an Olney designation.  Dont forget also that almost the entire eastern part of the county has a Silver Spring address.However I agree with you about where Aspen Hill fits into things.  If Im going shopping or what have you when leaving from my home in Aspen Hill Im far more likely to go north to Olney or west to Rockville than south to downtown Silver Spring for similar services.  Most of the time if Im in downtown Silver Spring Im either passing through by car on the way to DC or Im there for an event.,SilverSpring,cfn75rz,2,t5_2wy6x
1041146,0,t3_25yn98,I live there  do you have a specific question besides is it good?edit I have never seen a mouse I have never seen a roach or other bug I have never had problems with rent or getting paperwork signed on time.      I havent had the same problems with parking as other people in the reviews because its cheaper to park in the giant garage one block up on Fenton as it is free after PM and the cops rarely check the meters  so if you do any research its absolutely foolish to pay for a spot in the building. The front desk staff used to be better they contracted it out recently to some other company that is garbage. Whenever I call down the people come and fix my shit within a day or two and I have never had a problem with that.      I know a dude who straight up left because he said the office was terrible and offered to bribe him to take down his reviews. He left and moved somewhere else.        The location is awesome  close to lots of shit.     Also when I moved in the deal was a month of free rent and a free ipad so whatever.    I can answer specific questions if you have any.    ,SilverSpring,chmmsdw,2,t5_2wy6x
