1243315,0,t1_ci8wgyr,I didnt learn that he was married to Sharon Tate till I watched a Manson documentary a month or two ago. Cant imagine what it wouldve been like to have your wife and unborn child slain and on top of that have it be so out in the open in the media.I can also separate his work from his crimes and I dont think that doing so endorses his crimes. I absolutely can understand why some people would as I have a friend who boycotts anything Polanski and now Woody Allen as well. I wanted that friend to watch Carnage cause I thought it was hilarious but he wouldnt think twice about it. With someone still making movies like Polanski where do you draw the line? If you boycott him do you boycott anyone who agrees to work with him as well?,HorrorClub,ci9hlp3,6,t5_2u5hi
1251932,0,t3_28962l,repulsion is one of those movies where I can easily recognize the genius but cannot bring myself to sit through the whole way. Im a dialogue person so this movie just kinda bores me to be honest. Is it beautiful? yes. Is it repulsive? yes.  I like Roman Polanskis later work better i guess. Rosemarys Baby is a favorite. Love the Pianist as well although its not a horror film,HorrorClub,ciaghll,7,t5_2u5hi
1570042,0,t3_2bxqz0,I saw the second part years ago and then watched this one.I like both parts though this I didnt rewatch the second has some weak points For example every single character in this movie is incredibly cringeinducingbe it the two edgy sisters their parents the highschoolkids or that stoner guy. Also some of the scenes especially at the endjust drag on and on and on.But I liked the humor of this movie body in the freezer guy walkingaway with the syringe in his neck and the whole puberty metaphor wasnice too. Ginger in her semiwolfform looked a lot like the demons from Buffy The Vampire SlayerWhat gets me most is that the movie is somehow extremely charming. I cant really put myfinger on it but it is the same kind of charm I feel while watching The Faculty Dazed and Confused Scream or Ghost World. I think it has something to do with nostalgia andthe feeling of beeing an awkward teenager.Has anyone here seen part ? Would you recommend it? From what I remember part  is really good.,HorrorClub,cjd2twh,6,t5_2u5hi

2070468,0,t3_2iehmz,Im actually vacationing near where they shot Ravenous right now in the Sierra Nevada mountains Lake Tahoe and its a fantastic mountain range. I really wish more Western horror films would use the CaliforniaNevada regions to stage films. The Burrowers is the only other film that I would compare in its thematic setting to Ravenous.Overall its one of my favorite Western horror films. Thanks for picking this one and giving me another opportunity to rewatch it!Can someone explain to me why the beefcake soldier tries to kill Guy Pierce after getting stabbed and falling off the cliff?,HorrorClub,cl302yr,6,t5_2u5hi

2391538,0,t3_2lu0kb,The sackhead mask will always be one of my favorite faces of horror. The simplicity of it is great  it could have been something that just happens to be laying around in the garage when the wouldbe killer snaps grabs his hammer or machete and decides its time to kill. But its also menacing enough that I could see any psycho parading in front of the mirror fantasizing about murder as well.I love this film because its based on true events and the murderer is just a brutemurderer but what takes it home for me is the mask.,HorrorClub,cm7auya,3,t5_2u5hi
2809987,0,t1_cnnc0gm,I appreciate your usage of the term thrice. Im not shocked people dislike it so much though. It really depends on what your horror bread and butter is. Like I said on the podcast I think this is a movie made in  by a group of friends who wanted to make a movie from . As someone who adores those cheesy films of the late s this is right up my alley.Now Im off to watch Terrorvision haha,HorrorClub,cnnhj7w,6,t5_2u5hi

2965957,0,t1_co4brk5,Okay so first off it was an amazing movie visually and musically. Some of the animal cruelty was hard to watch but other than that there wasnt much that shocked me. Theres so much but basically I enjoyed its satirical look at society specifically religion and consumerism the shit to gold thing was wonderful on different levels the shameless calling out of politicians and industrialists as thieves to name a few. Going through the thieves was pretty interesting but I havent pinned down what theyre thieves of I will be watching this again but I got a few of them. Most obviously Neptune the thief of manhood cringe. Initially the ending pissed me right the fuck off but I thought about it and maybe I kind of understand. The main guy found love and was told he was his own master or something along those lines so love over religion is the message?? Religion is a big fat lie because this journey was a big fat liemovie? ,HorrorClub,co58th6,4,t5_2u5hi
3075001,0,t1_cogo6m9,Okay youve managed to remind me of the two things I didnt like about the movie. And it wasnt half a boob. There are people in Africa with no boobs you know. Are we really so spoiled boobwise we cant accept half a boob?Okay . No one could outrun that gator. Normal gators can run like  mph. That thing would be so fast. Also alligators can climb trees.TWO at the party there was a woman screaming on repeat that was annoying.In conclusion I might be slightly drunk. So dont fact check this post.,HorrorClub,cogpzug,6,t5_2u5hi

3536440,0,t1_cpuqf0d,I love the opening sequence. The dialogue and scenes from the fake Dracula movie are great. Sit here beside me on the veranda I love the night so. The title growing fangs is a nice touch.  The opening makeout scene sets up the movie perfectly the moral of which is obviously fuck your girlfriend. If Charley had been under Amys overalls instead of looking out the window nothing bad would have happened. Anyway it sets up the fact that Charley has major teenage problems. Fright Night takes Stokers idea that the strength of the vampire is that no one will believe in him and adds the weakness of the teenager is that no one will believe him. Who is whinier Charley or Amy? I cant decide. One of the funniest selfaware moments is when Peter Vincent pulls up to Jerrys house and its all covered in fog and he says I see what you mean... ,HorrorClub,cpvdkua,7,t5_2u5hi

4065392,0,t3_373vjb,Have not read the book. First time watching this movie I kinda liked it. Second time I actually found it pretty hilarious. Not sure if this was intentional but the confessions and the reporters fighting and the absurdity of the ending all came across very comical. I most likely wont watch it again as it is too long and just not very good. Ill most definitely be reading Locke and Key eventually but chances are I wont be reading this. Didnt even realize the connection until it was brought up in the podcast. Nor did I realize he was Kings son.
