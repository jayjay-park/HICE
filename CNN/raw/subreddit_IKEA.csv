159633,0,t3_1vwknc,I have had the Mysa Vete  for four or five years now and I still love it to this day. My sister has the same one at her room at college and her room at my parents house. Mysa Vete is a full down comforter with a cotton exterior. This particular brand and warmth level is made for people who feel warm at night. Its fairly thin but still has the fluffiness of a down comforter that I love. I have over  duvet covers from IKEA and they range in quality for the softness of the cotton. There is no particular rhyme or reason to which are softer. The price you pay really equates to the kind of duvet cotton youre going to get. For an idea I purchase the fullqueen size that ikea offers. The price ranges from .. for that size duvet cover. At . youve basically got burlap. .. are fairly decent ones and those are the ones I usually buy. The more expensive ones I only purchase if the pattern is something I absolutely cannot pass up. I have purchased approximately  nonIKEA duvet covers. I have gotten them from Bed Bath and Beyond Target and Home Goods. Beyond the fit the IKEA ones are my favorite   because of the pillow cases. The pocket on the slit that covers the pillow so it stays securely in the case is really a great feature.  IKEA also has a great variety of colors patterns and styles to choose from. TLDR  Im obsessed with bedding. Specifically IKEA bedding. ,IKEA,cewm5ub,3,t5_2s9a5

3012396,0,t3_2uk6u4,we went yesterday and bought some new base cabinets for our kitchen and some doors for the wall cabinets sturdy so we figured just replace the doors. Small hiccup on the top cabinets because of hinge issues we have old faceframe cabinet boxes but i think weve solved blum makes some hinges that can be face mounted. But now I am struggling to figure out the plinth which I bought yesterday too. From what I saw online and at store theres not a special leg set for Sektion they just have the Capita legs. So how am i supposed to attach the plinth to those? Is there an ikea compatible plinth clip set I can buy? I think Akurum had special legs that came with clips and I can see Metod has them...
