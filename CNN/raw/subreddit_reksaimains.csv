5785085,0,t3_3sijsu,For me standard build is Warrior enchant with blue smite into Black Cleaver then tank items from there. If your team lacks tanks then only in that situation would I go Cinderhulk. Hydra items are good but Warrior and BC alone is substantial as far as damage output goes. Dead mans is generally always my second or third item unless enemy team has a lot of AP damage in which case you can go Maw or Spirit Visage. posting as of patch .,reksaimains,cxe714n,2,t5_39225
5905795,0,t3_3w3gjc,What is your current clear path in the current jungle? I usually do a full clear but I thinking thats hurting me overall Im so low after it a level  gank is impossible. Also do you like to invade early probably based on who the other jungles is right?.My current clear bottom side is Krugs smite gt Wolves gt Scuttle gt Red smite gt Wolves gt Gromp Smite gt Blue while asking mid if they want the buff then I back get some items and look for a gank.Again it works but I feels like it might not be the best and again Im pretty low and subject to counter jungle at blue but Im afraid if I delay itll be stolen.Thoughts?,reksaimains,cxts7h8,1,t5_39225
6239105,0,t3_40x6dx,I feel like the attack speed Quints just add too much to drop them you would only get a little more damage out of Q but you wouldnt get it off fast enough to matter plus itd hurt clear speed. Pretty much ad reds armor yellows cdr blues and as quints is one of the best set ups for her cause it gives a bit of everything she would ever need,reksaimains,cyythnd,1,t5_39225
8249539,0,t3_4q1myk,Just let you guys know I ended up picking Xin Zhao. I am a simple person with poor mechanics so I found him easier to use. He is slightly slower than Reksai on his clear but his sustain is unbelievable,reksaimains,d58qybd,1,t5_39225

10774650,1,t1_ddr8x86,Reksai was meant to be a backline diver. Riot have said that reksai was not meant to be a cc tank and will be reworked later this year.,reksaimains,ddrbspx,0,t5_39225
