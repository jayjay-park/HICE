20101,0,t1_cegpib8,Thanks so much for your advice! I took her to training classes when I first had her but that was just basic commands. Shes extremely well trained within the confines of our place she stays in her bed while were eating sits by the door when she wants to go out doesnt run out the door when someone opens it etc.Im extremely proud of her behavior change since I got her. She was clearly abused and has had at least  litter of puppies. Someone just dropped her off at a shelter one night and walked away.  When I first got her she was sweet but she would pee on everything not marking just didnt know better and chew on ANYTHING. She is leaps and bounds ahead of when I got her. Anyway I didnt even think about more obedience classes now so thank you for that. I also have a couple friends who have nice dogs so Ill definitely be setting up some puppy play dates with them. Edit I just read that article and it was very informative. I guess I never realized she doesnt have to have doggy socialization. I always figured she was lonely after leaving my parents house. ,corgi,cegpzh1,3,t5_2rdw8

398823,0,t3_1yjpmr,Mine is a year old and nips when he is in Play Mode. He was much worse as a puppy because he needed constant stimulation and was bored.If your dog is nipping your heels then get him to walk beside you. Walk him using leash and collar for better control. Halti is even better because you can control his head movement. This will get him to stop doing it while out on walks.As for around the house when you arent playing  second timeouts anytime he puts his jaws on you. Put him in a room close the door and walk away for   seconds.  It took me over an hour to get him to stop. puppytraining subreddit argued that this method is cruel but my dog trainer with multiple dog certifications told me to do it and IT WORKED. Only time he nips is when he is initiated to play. That we are still working on.,corgi,cfm3qr8,1,t5_2rdw8

975809,0,t3_25a1mx,Work slowly on the crate throughout the day encourage him to go in and keep the door open. Feed him his meals inside the crate  put the bowl in and close the door with the puppy outside the crate. Let them explore and WANT to go in. Open the door let the puppy in and gently close the door behind them. Slow down eating to extend the time in the create by only putting a small bit of their meal in a bowl at a time or using a puzzle feeder like a kong.Kaplan crate games throughout the day and work up to closing the door behind them and letting them sit in there while you are in the room. Even a moment of calm and quite should make treats rain down. Slowly build upon duration at your puppys pace. At night make sure the crate is properly sized just big enough to stand turn around and lay down in. Make sure he goes outside right before bedtime and do not feed him or give him water mins before bed. If he cries COMPLETELY ignore him  this includes eye contact taking to him or interacting with him. The exception to this is if it has been  hours since you took him outside. If this is the case calmly get up attach his leash lead or carry him outside put him in his potty spot and give him  minutes. You may cue him ONCE then totally ignore him. Keep the leash restively short so he can sniff and explore but not the whole yard. Keep yourself anchored whole he does his thing. If he goes praise and give him a small treat and go DIRECTLY back to his crate. No additional attention no plays. This is a business only event. If he doesnt go in the time limit no treats no nothing  cue him back in the house and lead or carry him directly back to his crate. Ignore crying. If he didnt go and you think he may need to wait mins and of he starts to cry repeat. If he did go  hours is still the threshold. Yes young puppies are annoying. No you are probably not going to get a full nights sleep for a few months. With a vocal breed like a corgi crying on the crate can take quite a bit of time to work through. You can keep the crate close to your bed the first few weeks if it helps but slowly transition it to where you want it to be more permanently as he does better. Sometimes to opposite may be true too. We kept our corgis crate in the guest bedroom the first month or so he was home as he would wake up and cry ANY TIME one of us moved in bed. He learned to calm himself down faster and would only wake up when he needed to go after the nd or rd night. Each puppy is different carefully evaluate the situation and make a call. Dont be afraid to try things just make sure you dont accidentally reinforce undesired behavior and that you can get him outside when he needs to goConsistency is key. Have a stronger will than your puppy.   ,corgi,chf7iho,2,t5_2rdw8

2699989,0,t3_2qxg9c,Where did you find this type of corgi!!??,corgi,cnaz8fq,2,t5_2rdw8
2730304,0,t1_cnebd3l,I have had our corgi for over  years. I spent  years researching the breed and knew a lot about their pros and cons. I was interested in the breed to start competing in agility Great endurance and work ethic and I didnt really care about shedding at all. I was drawn to the breed for their tenacity their desire to work and their overall personality. I was really interested in dog sports and advanced training making this little work horse a great fit for us.I would not have gotten a different breed  A corgi worked well for what I was looking for and he is a FANTASTIC agility dog but many people get into the breed for the wrong reasons. If you want a purebred dog become and expert in the breed you are interested in and know everything you can about them from genetic health risks to reputable breeders to standard heights weights and colors. Know the strengths of the breed as well as their weaknesses. Being fully informed will help ensure you are choosing the right dog for your needs and will make working with great breeders easier.If shedding is a big sticking point for you you really arent going to be that happy with a corgi. They shed in clouds and they shed ALL the time but much worse at certain points in the year. Try spending some time with the breed  go to agility conformation or other events corgis are at and talk to some ownersmeet some dogs. Most owners will be HAPPY to talk your ear off about their dogs if you approach them in the right atmosphere. These are herding dogs so they are relatively high maintenance high energy and true assholes if you arent serious about training. The first year we had our corgi I did little else other than train and work with him. Puppies are a TREMENDOUS amount of work especially when you are working with a breed built to herd cattle all day nip bark and be incredibly stubborn. They are awesome dogs for the right situation but they are really not great for someone who doesnt really want to spend a lot of time working with them. Young puppies also cannot jog until they are at least  months old. You will need to spend extra time each day doing lower impact exercise and training with the pup the first yearyear and a half. They also cannot be alone for more than a couple hours at a time so you will need to have a plan to ensure a young puppy can get outside regularly.Corgis are cute but they are not cuddly chill out type of dog. Having an interest in jogging is good but they REALLY need mental stimulation. Our corgi can hike and run all day and still be ready for more  they really need a good amount of training and other activities that work out their minds for them to be relatively agreeable. If jogging is your primarily activity there are other breeds that may be better suited to your needs standard poodles come to mind  low shedding intelligent great companions and would be great jogging partners with proper endurance training. It may also be smart to start looking for adoptable individuals to find a dog that has the right personality for your lifestyle.Do more research get out there and meet dogs know everything you can about the breed to know if it will be a good fit or not. There are tons of different breeds and individuals out there that may be a great fit as what you like about the corgi is relatively nonspecific. Try not to get too hung up on their looks as they really are hearty highenergy working dogs.,corgi,cnef9vw,2,t5_2rdw8

3148388,0,t1_cooa5j0,Im not saying anything about whether or not theyre suitable or practical for herding Id agree that theyre very good at both actually since theyre so smart. All Im saying is it doesnt make sense to me to dock tails just in case theres an injury later in life.There are s of ways a dog could get hurt on a farm how common actually is getting their tails stepped on? They dont herd horses do they? Was there some great huge problem with corgis getting their tails stepped on and thats why docking began? Maybe train them to stay away from horses then instead. I totally understand the why of your reasoning for docking tails Im saying I dont think its a good enough why. Im saying I think its inhumane and outdated and that there are better ways to prevent tail injury if its a big enough concern. I feel the same for schnauzers and scotties. Those dogs are pretty short at least only at the height of corgis and they commonly have docked tails too. Whether or not its for the same initial reason as getting tailstepped by a horse or cow both schnauzer and scottie would make good herd dogs too the main reason Ive heard is that in show dog competitions the judges consider an undocked tail to be a fault. Thats it. ,corgi,coobsf1,2,t5_2rdw8

4334195,0,t3_3amlw0,I agree with another  poster that you should have an account set up first with at least a couple thousand. Expenses can come flying at you fast and unexpected  I have had several cats and dogs and it just happens. Our little guy got bladder stones suddenly we were looking at expensive medicine possibly surgery.  Thankfully the stones broke up on their own with medicine. The medicine and vet visits were still several hundred dollars. Now he is on a special food for his urinary system the rest of his life that costs about  a bag...thats  every couple months. Fleatickheartworm meds and spayingneutering your pup should also be taken into account. An additional cost for us is paying  a friend to walksit him if we travel somewhere we cannot take him. We usually count this into our travel budget. Learning how to groom your pet properly can save some money I had a collie growing  up and they require excessive grooming to keep up their gorgeous coat. So a corgi was easy....they shed. A lot. Come to think of it you may need a really kickass vacuum too. D,corgi,cse6yqx,4,t5_2rdw8

We took him with us to the beach last year and he had a freaking blast in the sand.  We forced him into the water a few times and he is a great swimmer.  Makes it quickly and easily straight back to the shore every time.  But he has a thing for German Shepards.  At socialization class the park they use has a few muddy spots when its rained some.  So a lot of the dogs like to go play in the mud holes.  He completely avoids them usually.  But when his GSD buddies show up... he hesitates and looks for another way to join in... and eventually gives up and is wallowing around in all that muddy water right along with him.  Such strange pups they are.  He will usually stop whatever he is doing and run over to them when were at the dog park and he sees a GSD come in.,corgi,cyqqt03,2,t5_2rdw8

9784001,0,t1_da083aq,I promised an update and little Cora did amazing traveling! Unfortunately she isnt so little anymore and I think this will be her one and only trip  shes nearly over the weight limit!The large Sherpa worked really well though I had trouble flying back because we were in a smaller plane A and she had to go under the middle seat with my boyfriend instead of my window seat. Otherwise no issue fitting. The vet told me to get Benadryl mg pills and give her half of one  minutes before I wanted her to get groggy. Worked like a charm! She was quiet and while she moved around she seemed fine. We were able to carry her around the terminal before the flight and only stuffed her in the bag once it was time to board so hopefully that reduced some stress. I also didnt feed her before the flight very late departure so she had a small breakfast but no dinner to reduce the chance of her getting sick. The only issue I ran into which had nothing to do with her was an American Airlines employee. Flying out the AA reps were awesome I just handed over my pet fee and got a receipt. Coming home the guy filled out a whole form and made me feel like we were doing something wrong by bringing her. I had all her paperwork ready if need be AND she was on my reservation called ahead so it was obvious we had flown with her once already and gone through the proper protocol. Everything was fine but his demeanor towards us left me a bit ruffled. ,corgi,daj3auo,1,t5_2rdw8

After the first round his tumors shrank and he got the energy and attitude of a puppy again.  He lived another year before the chemo stopped working but it was the BEST year ever.

10291221,0,t1_dcajsxm,Id recommend reaching out to some breeders that are local to you or even going to a dog show where they may be showing. Often after showing is done people will have some time to spend with you and youll be allowed to pet the pups too. ,corgi,dcakdj5,2,t5_2rdw8

10554969,0,t3_5qsb0e,Actually the corgi is a pretty healthy breed. There is not exaggerated lowness or difficulty moving. That it is a herding breed helps in that the goal is to breed something that can move with ease and work cattle all day long. The genetic drift is toward the normal dog size and shape or taller legs with shorter bodies. Therefore you will see more tall short coupled corgis being bred by puppymills where maintaining health and the breed standard are not as high a priority. Puppy mill bred dogs may have been your introduction to the breed as they are easier to get than well bred health tested corgis perhaps skewing your view of the breed.You sound like you have an agenda but so do people who breed corgis for show. The corgi breeders goal is to turn out the healthiest correct corgi possible. That means donating to the canine health foundation to do breed specific research to determine health problems develop tests and eradicate diseases in the breed. So far great strides have been made so that a clotting disease has all but been eradicated from the breed. We are making great strides! ,corgi,dd4iwcq,0,t5_2rdw8
