Half a pound a day is ideal for safety but people who lose a pound a day report that everything went just fine.

Lift weights.....not so much.  Keeping muscles toned is one thing but on a juice diet youre basically depriving yourself of the building blocks for muscles I.e. protein.  Working out to retain physical fitness is great but keep in mind that youre operating at about  of your caloric intake give or take during a juice fast so energy is going to evaporate quickly.,Juicing,cf6d226,1,t5_2s602

You need more than  calories per day.  There is no way to sustain that few calories.  I started with some of the more fruit based juices that had fewer calories.  Specifically with watermelon as the base.  I started with the sweeter juices and have moved towards the green.  With that said  some of them are just bad tasting so I opt for others that are better for my palate.  PM me if you want to have additional dialogue.  I am on Day  and seem to be doing ok.
