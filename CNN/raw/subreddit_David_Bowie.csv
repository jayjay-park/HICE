6307721,0,t1_cz3ztua,Its called My Death. Its a cover of a Jacques Brel song that Bowie only ever performed live. Scott Walker had done a bunch of Brel covers a couple of years earlier and Bowie was inspired by Walker a few times in his career. The translation Bowie sings isnt exactly accurate but its quite Bowie.,David_Bowie,cz6m7ua,1,t5_2tcfj
