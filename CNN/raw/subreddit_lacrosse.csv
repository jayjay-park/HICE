126217,0,t3_1vis0j,I would say for the head look for a warrior evo x. Its not too pinched so he can catch passes easily. As for the shaft I would say look for the nike vandal. Even though its a little bit more on the expensive side it will last longer and he will love it. But the most important thing about a lacrosse stick is the stringing. Make sure the person that is stringing his stick knows how to very well because nothing is more frustrating than throwing with a stick that has a terrible string job on it. I would recommend sending the head you buy to a professional stringing company like StylinStrings,lacrosse,cessys1,1,t5_2r1ig

404261,0,t1_cfmnfqj,Sounds like you may be jumping back into athletics faster than your body can handle it. Consider seeing your schools athletic training staff if you have it take up foam rolling and make a lacrosseballpeanut to roll your back muscles before any type of exercise and make sure to get in a good warm up before practice with stretching before and after. How to make peanut Foam roller on amazon  The video above shows how using some kinesio tape. Another option which I do is to use the cheap athletic tape from Walgreens or CVS instead of the kinesio tape. At least every other day I use the peanut to stretch the thoracic spine. Do this by positioning the peanut centered and perpendicular to the spine at the bottom of the rib cage with the spine splitting the two lacrosse balls. With knees bent and butt and feet planted on the ground give yourself a hug and lean back to rest the back of your head on the ground. Hang out there for about a minute and let the tension release. Proceed all the way up to the base of the neck holding for a minute at each spot along the way.EDIT more info  ,lacrosse,cfmo22e,3,t5_2r1ig

You can use the extra reach of the pole to make up for it and get a lift on the shot with the outside hand as they come down the alley.

There are very few people especially outside of the college coaching ranks that get by solely on lacrosse.First you have to decide what you want to do  there is a huge difference between running a league tournaments camps and club teams.  The one thing in common is that it helps to build strong relationships in the lacrosse community.  As the sport continues to grow this community unfortunately becomes less and less close knit but in most areas the coaches and camp directors all know each other.

1292618,1,t3_28w0t2,Hey youre talking about Roller Coaster Rumble. I was on the undefeated winning team. Let me say first off Ive played on a highly competitive travel team for the past four years and shoveled out around  to travel all over the east coast. Ive been in my fair share of recruiting tournaments and gotten a few offers so having said that dont write me off as a punk that doesnt care about the conduct of the sport. Now on to the tournament you mentioned. We payed   total for this tournament. The goal of this team that my friend and teammate organized. Was not to get recruited but to just have fun playing the sport we love. We simply wanted a break from the stress filled highly expensive and selective teams that we were used to. Our parents knew fully that we were at this tournament just to have fun and just relax. Honestly I thought we were going to get beat pretty bad because we had never practiced together and was just a pickup team of select players. It was a huge surprise when we won the whole tournament. I apologize about our conduct but keep in mind we just wanted to have a good time without being held to the super high standards that were used to with our actual travel teams. ,lacrosse,cif1bce,-9,t5_2r1ig

If you have been playing a lot of summer ball and exposing yourself to recruiters then you will see offers come in on their own but some athletes dont get the opportunity to showcase themselves in person.

1861917,0,t3_2fvvie,I was in a similar situation to you when I was in HS the coach that had been there for ever was fired at the end of my Soph. year and a new coach took over. Under the new guy I had a fantastic junior season g a which led to me being able to play in college. Unfortunately my senior season didnt go nearly as well with g and a. My coach had a propensity for yelling and it often seemed like that was his only volume.After our opener my senior year which we lost  or something like that he made us turn in all our gear and we did what basically amounts to a punishment run for two hours the next day. He specifically called me out several times and made us do updowns because of me. I knew he was trying to get me to quit but I didnt. Had a teammate that did but I refused. It was right then that I knew I loved lacrosse too much for any coach to ever ruin it for me.So what Im saying is you need to ask yourself do you love playing lacrosse more than you dislike your coach?Also ubrotherhoodofdada hit it on the head pretty well too.,lacrosse,ckdk0k0,2,t5_2r1ig

2211262,0,t3_2kffb5,As far as improving general lacrosse IQ Xs and Os are on a per team basis so I wouldnt worry too much about that watch and play as much as you can. That really is the best way to figure it out. On both offense and defense pay attention to the off ball action most of all.Ill touch on defense because thats what I played and what I coach. If a defense is well organized and constantly communicates it can shut down any offense. You may have five other defenders and a goalie out there but all seven of you should know what each other are doing. Who is the hot two and fill are the adjacent guys sloughed in and hedging or locking off and forcing inside looks and isos etc.Dont ball watch dont face guard off ball  talk and keep your head on a fucking swivel. Whether its a high pressure or sloughed in conservative set I prefer a sloughed in D but I give some room for my top poles to press out and get their takeaways the key is occupying dangerous space. IMO all the over scripted offenses ridiculous substitution patterns and specialized positions are just from modern coaches over thinking things and trying to justify their growing paychecks. At its best lacrosse is played up and down the field with two way midfielders. While on offense and off ball always consider this  are you an option at that moment? Keep yourself moving in relation to the ball and always try to be an option or at the very least an outlet to recycle posession.Exceptional motion offenses are predicated on spacing and intuitive movement though and not so much like diagramed footballlike plays. Id say its more similar to organized attacking movements in soccer or motion sets in basketball  there are concepts and rules but players are allowed some room for interpretation. The quality of the interpretation grows with experience. ,lacrosse,clkwl91,6,t5_2r1ig

You will gain a lot more experience and more respect from them that have played the game longer or are goalies themselves it is no easy picnic in goal you can ask any excurrent goalie that.

3118792,0,t1_col91dg,Oooo.. this a good one.  Theres no rule changes that would affect this.  My first instinct is that I know of no rule that strictly forbids this.  I will say that I will without a doubt be checking your crosse at the first timeout if the other coach doesnt ask me to beforehand.  Your crosse will probably fail one of the four rollout tests.So I broke out my rule book.gt The crosse shall be made of wood laminated wood or synthetic material with the head approximately perpendicular to the handle. The side wall opposite the wood wall may be made by weaving gut lacing from the tip of the head to the handle strung in such a manner as to prevent the tip from catching on an opponents crosse or both walls may be of wood laminated wood or synthetic material. The stop shall be constructed so that the ball shall rest on the stop. The net of the crosse shall be constructed of gut rawhide linen or synthetic material and shall be roughly triangular in shape. The longitudinal weaving shall be attached at the back of the throat of the crosse.gt Any crosse in which the net is woven to the head in such a manner that a lip or hook is formed that might ensnare the ball is illegal.Ok things to look for here.   is important cause that could easily happen with the stringing you propose.  I would also regard this line The longitudinal weaving shall be attached at the back of the throat of the crosse.  That means that the vertical strings must be attached to the BACK of the throat.  What is the back and what is the front of the throat?  Theres no official definition that I found.  But you would be hard pressed to convince an official anything besides what the manufacturer designed.  Based on that wording I would probably rule the crosse illegal.  If you managed to string a crosse backwards where that still applied... I guess I would have no choice but to allow it.  Not quite sure how effective it would be our if would pass all my stick checks.,lacrosse,col9g96,5,t5_2r1ig

All hollow crosse handles must have their open end covered with an end cap manufactured for a lacrosse stick. In both cases the crosse shall not be considered illegal however it shall be removed from the game until corrected.So all strings hanging from the head should be under  inches had a winter league game this past weekend where the stick I checked had  inches... smh.  Its a simple fix and you wont get a penalty unless you dont fix it.The end cap has to be a manufactured meaning you cant make one at home.  The end caps you buy are put through tests for durability.  You cant just use tape or a bottle cap to cover the butt end.  It HAS to be a manufactured end.  I will make you take the tape off to show me if it is all taped up.

I notice your justification for playing time is strictly related to offensive skills.

5940407,0,t3_3wp7sv,Since you are at a good school Im sure youre coaching staff has a developed couple of sets they like to use. The main schemes Ive seen used are    . Learn how the picking and spacing works in each system. So if you get the ball and there isnt an obvious shot or alley move it quickly. Make the defense have to work.  Something important we always preach as coaches is that the ball always moves faster than the man. Work the ball and understand the systems until a good opportunity opens up whether it be an iso dodge or a dodge to pass to create space. Also ask your coaches. They know what offense you will be running so seek their advice on what you can do to better fit their schemes. Always be practicing either mentally or literally. Watch as much film as you can. Watch how great offenses move. Learn how to offball pick. If you can learn to play offense without the ball you will quickly become one of the most valuable members of the offense. The goal gets the glory but the pick gets the goal. Hope this could be of any use. Cheers! Please find the video links below. ,lacrosse,cxybfxe,1,t5_2r1ig

6400025,0,t3_43bg0d,gt The problem is all the cups Ive worn get in the way and chafe my thighs or slow me down a lot.I started wearing polyester boxer briefs or compression shorts underneath a jock strap to deal with the chafing. With it in compression shorts I always felt like it was never being held in the right spot and if it ever got hit it was going to get knocked into my balls instead of deflecting the impact around them. But ultimately youre just going to have to try different things until you find something that works for you. What is most comfortable for someone may not be the most comfortable thing for you.Regarding it getting in the way or slowing you down in my opinion while a cup might chafe and it might be uncomfortable unless youre doing something very out of the ordinary its not actually impacting the ability of your muscles to perform. Fact of the matter is that there is no way to strap a piece of plastic over your junk in a way thats going to be as comfortable as not having it there. It can take some getting used to especially if youre used to wearing boxers and having plenty of freedom down there. At the end of the day its not supposed to be comfortable  youre not wearing it to lounge around the house on vacation  its supposed to ensure that you will still be the proud owner of fully functional genitalia at the end of the game or practice. Once the adrenaline starts flowing during a game you wont notice it.If I may don my old man hat for a moment and go on a get off my lawn rant. The pads helmets gloves uniforms etc. are a thousand times lighter and more comfortable than all the pads and equipment that people played with years ago. Everyone managed to play just fine wearing them. So if youre chafing or think there is a more comfortable option by all means wear something else. However if you cant find a way to wear a cup that you deem to be comfortable enough then you need to stop being a pussy quit complaining and toughen up. Its not an issue of comfort its an issue of mental toughness.,lacrosse,czh48km,2,t5_2r1ig

6495422,0,t3_44m3yu,Is eye black an effective method of absorbing sunlight thus keeping it out of your eyes?According to mythbusters yesish and TIFO says probably  and NY Times says the stickers are less effective than the stick but all could be placebo effect  So not one says outright it wont work... BUT... You should know... If youre under NFHS sanctions i.e. you play organized HS ball or NCAA ... anything more than one fluid line that extends under and across the eye thats a paraphrase on my part but the gist is illegal and the game can be stopped because of it happened to my crew last year. So no letters shapes squiggles etc... just one fluid line form one side of each eye to the other. It cant legally even cross the bridge of your nose... so that generally takes a lot of the wind out of players sails if they were going for style points. Basically  Can you use it? Yes.  Does it help? Perhaps.  Can you do anything other than make a small line below each eye? Not legally.  Is there a penalty for miswearing it? No  gameplay stops effected players are removed from the field until theyve fixed it. No penalty. In our game the players didnt even sit out a play as the referee waited for them to fix it.... there were  of them. That was the refs call to wait. TLDR The effecitveness of it is debateable but it might work. It cannot legally be used as a decoration  so if you are looking for two lines on your face go for it. It wont make you a better player though  hit the wall. ,lacrosse,czr6ao8,4,t5_2r1ig

Against a commit who is using a lot of his body to jam his stick a defensive draw is the smart choice there and there isnt a need to perform a different move. You also may not have the opportunity to do different moves in those situations. Like Bruce Lee once said I fear not the man who has practiced  kicks once but I fear the man who has practiced one kick  times.

Ive seen parents spend gobs of money tens of thousands to try and get their kids a scholarship when they could have used the money for college and had their kid not end up hating them. I think it is BULLSHIT that your parents are making you do a sport you dont enjoy. And I think it is bad parenting. It is counter productive to your long term enjoyment of sports which should be their goal. Sports are not just a path to a scholarship and the odds ar you wont get a scholarship anyway. They are misguided and it is  damaging your long term health and wellness and their relationship with you. I say that as a parent coach and player. So I would tell them that a complete stranger on the internet said they have the whole thing wrong and that you should be able to play whatever sport you want.

Makes sense and thats a great offense in regular v and manup if they follow you a bit aggressively but I can see why it would be stifled by the  zone and other defenses that are fluid with their rotations. I cant imagine teams are chasing you behind the goal while your are on manup.My suggestion would be to add a wrinkle where one of the  attackmen at X can pop up above GLE on one side and bump the offensive players on the side one of the  in the  up top to form a rotation into a  set with  players above the goal ready to shoot with the X attackman still looking to sneak. The best way to beat a zone is to work a  on  and in a  youll have a nice  on s with your attackman at X attackman on the wing and your best shooting middie up top. If the defense rotates you spin the ball around the other side and try to get the v to turn into a v. Hope that makes sense but it basically boils down to adding another rotation that would bring you into a  just in case you run into another defense like that. ,lacrosse,dg56own,1,t5_2r1ig
