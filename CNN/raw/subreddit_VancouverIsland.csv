7461099,0,t3_4hj82z,head out to Port Renfrew lots of nice beaches and parks there. There is a old logging road that is paved now that takes you all the way back to Lake Cowichan its not too far under a hour drive and it is very scenic. From there follow the highway north island and look for the signs for wineries and breweries there all over the place. The main tourist destination on the island is probably Tofino a bit farther for you but well worth the drive ,VancouverIsland,d2qa45e,5,t5_2r9fk

Also be sure to head to Ucluelet before you leave the area its a beautiful little town and much less touristy than Tofino. Have fun!,VancouverIsland,ddqz3r3,5,t5_2r9fk
