8917287,0,t1_d7jkggm,I think the point is that someone cant make a short lived novelty account and then take us by storm. Like say we find out that Senator Clinton actually has a pierced eyebrow and has been hiding it really well. If suddenly we learn that and then someone makes the account uHillarysBrow and then starts making comments on every eyebrowgate post that wouldnt be allowed because they are just taking advantage of current buzz.,beetlejuicing,d7jq6zr,3,t5_2w1qa

11620233,0,t1_dgcvi0b,Alright Ive been studying this. It has to be an account thats shared with a bot that auto comments on all posts that mention Andre the giant. Really its clever.
