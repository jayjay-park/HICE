2503070,0,t3_2oa2ca,I dont even mind the occasional crazy message. What I hate is scrolling through pages and pages of individual items of clothing. If you have a box full of clothes for a two year old boy fine. But you seriously have time to sell two dozen shirts individually?!  Why the hell did you buy them in the first place? Who the hell are you? I also think its pretty funny when you see the same random crap pop up year after year. Its like YUP what youve got there is some random ass crap that NOBODY wants!

When you have good references youll more likely find a contractor the will meet your needs at a good cost. Online review and advice are great tools but not quite as valuable experience from people you know. Insulation Contractors ,Juneau,coghbfc,2,t5_2siqn

3675084,0,t1_cqavq2j,Traditionally chitosan is extracted from shells through a series of hardcore chemical and acid baths including  HCL ad NaOH. My chemist partner helped invent a new method that does not use any of those chemicals that are expensive to dispose of which is why chitinchitosan is only processed in Asia currently.  Not only that but it is a closed loop system we designed so we recycling all the solution.  And our method of extraction also for coproduct isolation.So our only byproduct is the rest of the shells.  Which has great fertilizer potential. ,Juneau,cqb6md2,1,t5_2siqn

7833175,0,t1_d3u6yxz,Well in his defense hes one of the most real straight talk no b.s. relatives I got the least of which Id be avoiding at any family gathering. If landlocked is a technical term then perhaps it should be technically correct when used? The issue I have with his contention isnt that he isnt correct its that he is unable to provide a correct technical term in its place... however lack of alternative terminology doesnt automatically make the current terminology correct. Neither do major publications using the incorrect terminology. ,Juneau,d3wilx5,2,t5_2siqn
