205122,1,t1_cf1p1m4,Totally. I think  is a bit ridiculous for a tour van. Andrew Jackson Spice Girls jk. I just feel that with all of the merch they sell they might be able to afford a more reasonable van on their own. I am part of a group that used Indiegogo to raise  to buy a mobile recording studio for anyone in the community to use. We did not raise the money to make it easier on ourselves. We didnt even reach our IGG goal. But through hard work garage sales benefit shows movie nights etc we raised the money needed to professionally record most bands. We are attempting to help an entire community with  not around X that so we can buy a fucking tour van. It just irks me a bit to see big bands that could afford what they need already through their fans relying on their fans for more. I probably shouldnt post this but fuck it.

Did you write the lyrics prior to putting the guitar in? Also you could probably do without the harmonica bit. The beginning of the second verse sounds great in the first to lines the delivery on the lovedrug lines are good and then it sort of throws off the flow you had with the longer President related line.

2536429,0,t3_2oqheo,Im male  and am a senior in college in Michigan.  In high school and early college I had a more punk exterior had a DIY jacket and vest that I made with my bare hands out of old jeans and other pieces of clothing.  I still have plenty of the tshirts that I hand stenciled myself.  Ive played in a couple of bands but they were all pretty shit and never played any shows.  Funnily enough it was my parents that got me into the genre.  At  or  I started listening to Rise Against because I saw the music video for Ready to Fall as I was getting ready for school in the morning and my mom who was into punk back in the day told me to go listen to Holiday in Cambodia which we had on vinyl.  Ive always listened to music for the lyrics and punk has been the only genre that Ive ever found that has anything resembling strong heartfelt and meaningful lyrics that I agree with. Ive gotten some people into bands like Against Me! and Streetlight Manifesto but I really only have one friend who I can consider a punk.  There were a few others in my hometown but before I ever said a single word to them they would shout poser from across the street.  I ignored them and went about my life but it and the fact that I dont get to go out much keeps me from meeting others into the genre.However if you want to talk Folk Punk my first foray into it was with Against Me!s Acoustic EP followed quickly by Pat the Bunny.  I adore the genre because it brings to the table the sort of raw emotion that no other genre that Ive ever heard can bring.  Its people who pour their heart and soul into the music.  In almost every other genre its hard to hear emotion but in folk punk you can hear the sadness when the speak of the death of loved ones you can hear the joy when singing about beer or friends or good times and its a genre I hold near and dear.,FolkPunk,cmpnbdu,3,t5_2shm1

Then knife man added overdrive guitars and it was a slippery slope into pop rock. Then Christmas Island was released and I was just fucking done. I dont know if youve followed them since the beginning but its disappointing to watch them put down the mandolin to pick up a plugged in overdriven guitar.  The lyrics dont even mean anything in the newest album. Please juxtapose one of their early albums with kokopelli face tattoo it just genuinely makes me sad.. Im not trying to be elitist.

Please stop.The line he used is what I was referring to. I wasnt controlling anyone and seeing as OP isnt commenting on anyone elses posts but the ones who outright agree with him he isnt going to change his mind anyway.

11452097,0,t3_6396r7,Albuquerque has an all right diy scene mainly in the summer. It is getting more bike and commuter friendly all the time and Id say its a focus of the city! Most restaurants have veg options but you have to watch out for the local food as they put green chile in everything and sometimes the green chile sauce isnt veg friendly. The closer you are to the university the more veg conscious people are!Great city though! Home sweet home.,FolkPunk,dfu344u,3,t5_2shm1

When you get out of high school college or whatever bubble you live in youre going to learn that change and progress of any kind come through cooperation. In life you meet people from different cultures backgrounds and demographics and learning to get along with all of them even the ones different from you is important if you wanna live in an inclusive  progressive society. Also side note since no one else has called you out on it and you take aversion so poorly fucking someones mom isnt dominating them because a woman isnt just an extension of her male family members. ,FolkPunk,dgsfiq1,2,t5_2shm1
