3091165,0,t3_2vk896,w spsx dont buy tritype whatsoever but itd be  or  probably.s pretty common for ESTJ and I imagine spdom types are overrepresented in STJs and s alike. While many other ESTJs are driven more toward achieving  and correctingimproving  Im mostly concerned with getting mine and keeping everyone else the hell out of my business. I am a great leader but I dont particularly enjoy doing it leading means people depend on me and I dont like that. I enjoy helping people a lot and improving the lives of others but they have to actually do it and get better and stop needing me. When I integrate to  I can lose some of the selfinterest and get more into helping others outside my immediate purvey but more in a defenderprotector sort of way than directly providing amenities. To illustrate Im going into nursing to be a nurse manager or work in public health and policy formation not necessarily to do direct patient care day in and day out. I could never do longterm care.... nobody gets better youre just keeping them from getting worse.My husband is an ESFP w sosx hed be a . Pretty much takes the typical ESFP stereotypes ramps them up to  and throws in several extra dashes of lazy stoner nice guy. Hes very intelligent and does well at anything academic or otherwise he applies himself to but hes so social that hed probably rather work at his part time bartending job the rest of his life over his field of study biology and medical lab science. He is incredibly gowiththeflow a terrible procrastinator has a pretty strong moral compass and can be quite judgemental of others is somehow incredibly socially oblivious and still very well liked by virtually everyone we know.

3290700,0,t3_2xtnxe,Ive never dated anyone although I have gone on two dates. The first date was with a person whos type I dont know but Im going to assume it was ISFP. Anyway I made some subtle passes at her and she eventually responded by asking me to go with her to out high schools winter dance. I accepted and spent  on a pinstriped suit dress shirts a pair of dress shoes and a few ties. I knew that it was a formal dance so I figured Id go balls to the wall on my appearance. Anyway the night of the dance. I was terribly overdressed especially when compared to my date who was wearing a skirt and a blouse. Anyway we had fun for awhile. And then she dropped the bomb she had a boyfriend and asked me to go with her because she didnt want to go without a date. I tried not to show it but I was extremely upset after hearing that. I mean I wasnt upset about her having a boyfriend no I was upset because she didnt tell me that she had a boyfriend andor that she didnt make it clear that we would go as friends. I was romantically interested in her true but I wouldve been more than happy to go with her as her friend. Anyway I suppose I mustve acted different after hearing that because my date complained about a sudden headache and left twelve minutes later. The second date wasnt as fancy or formal as my first date but it had a much more enjoyable end result. See in the same year of high school sophomore year I was in an art class with a girl EXFJ Ive been friends with for a long time. Well more like friendly acquaintances than friends we didnt really talk all that often. Anyway I was pretty talkative during that period of my life and it mustve annoyed her because she bet me that I couldnt be absolutely silent for a single class. I bet her that I could and that shed have to go on an in school date with me if she lost. Due to overconfidence she accepted. One class later I had myself a date. The date wasnt anything too special I bought her lunch that day and sat next to her while she conversed with her peer group desperate to ignore my existence. Surprisingly we were still friends after that. As for types Id like to date in theory...ISFP Despite my ultimately negative interaction with one Id quite like to date an ISFP. The ISFPs I know seem to appreciate my perspective and I enjoy learning from their experiences. Besides ISFPs are one of the most independent types so clinginess probably wouldnt be an issue.ENTJ Their thought process is similar enough for me to be able to communicate with an ENTJ effectively. In addition an ENTJ would be able to draw me out of my hermit hole and try new things. XNFJ I would love to date an INFJ. I cant quite explain it we just seem to get each other. The only downside I can think of is that I would probably get weirded out seeing as how my parents are both INFJs. Contrary to what Freud said I have absolutely positively no desire to pork my Mom. ENFJs would be a bit harder for me to communicate with dat dominant Fe but I highly doubt that dating an ENFJ would make me feel like an incestuous swine. IxTP In this instance S and N make very little difference for me. As a general rule of thumb Im highly attracted to mature Tidominants. ISTJ While there would be a fair deal of conflicts what has worked vs. what could work better for example dating an ISTJ would result in a mutually beneficial end. The ISTJ would help me get my head out of the clouds and pay attention to reality and Id help the ISTJ be more accepting of change and unconventional solutions. WinWin.,sensor,cp3d744,2,t5_360iq

Thats basically a benzo it works on the same receptors. So the withdrawal is gonna be like benzo withdrawal which is not cute. You cant just cold turkey. You have to figure out the least amount you can take and take that same dose every day for about a month so your body adapts to it and stabilizes. Otherwise youre gonna be having interdose withdrawals which is whats happening right now youre kind of cold turkeying every ten days. Once youre stabilized you kind of have to toy around with how much you can take off your dose each week or each day if your systems really messed up like mine and still have a functional amount of sleep.,sensor,cpn56dr,3,t5_360iq
