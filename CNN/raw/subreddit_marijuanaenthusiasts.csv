That would allow them to pinpoint the exact location of an infestation or threat for eradication. With the proper procedures in place units could prevent spreading diseases into clean areas.Since we cant really utilize satellites to examine below the forest canopies perhaps small flying drones could be utilized instead. If networked in large groups the small drones could possibly be very effective at covering swaths of ground which would take people far to long to do by hand. With good recognition software it would make it even easier to identify a problem within a grid and dispatch a proportionally appropriate response to that area.,marijuanaenthusiasts,cgpm4yh,3,t5_2uzej

However the right time to dig  Japanese Maples is in the spring.  The spring is when nurseries are super busy digging from their fields from sun up to sun down  days a week so it may be hard to take time to dig one from your yard but its worth asking.

6740902,0,t3_472413,Youll be okay with repotting but give them at least partial shade for a couple weeks and only plain water for that time as well. Transplant shock hits roots for a couple weeks as they get broken and open up to allow anything thats in the soil water to be taken up. For this reason you should definitely hold off on fertilizer until shock is over. You may see some of the lowest leaves show signs of stress turning brittle from the leaf margins this is the plant dumping excess nutrients taken up via broken as well as stored necessary nutrients moving out and up the plant as its having a tough time at the root level. Water before and after the repotting for the easiest time on the roots thats the most fragile and important part.,marijuanaenthusiasts,d0gkfcu,1,t5_2uzej

The result there is that the threat to actual extinction is minimal and so time is less a factor in figuring out how to combat the blight.EAB though kills ash trees outright meaning we might have to act a lot faster right?

From what it looks like I think the trees were here and a previous owner tried to beautify them by putting up a retaining wall and adding dirt around the base. Here are some pictures of the tree that didnt fall down and the aftermath of the one that did. ,marijuanaenthusiasts,dbqfuxl,1,t5_2uzej

It is massive now.  I suggest moving it away from the window and moving it on top of a heater. I now have it inside in a colder state and its soil has been moist the whole time and my leaves are starting to brown as well.

10639089,0,t1_dd5t8hc,Perfect description. You want the dirt in the pot to be just wet enough to stick lightly together.Im also wondering when the last time you repotted with fresh soil was. Since you are not using food going more than about  months will use up all the nutrients in the soil. If you do need to repot dont go any bigger in pot size. Also add some marbles or similarly sized rocks to the bottom of the pot to aid drainage. Get a soil marked specifically for ferns or if cant find a small bag of MiracleGro  Im assuming you dont have a lot of plants and dont need lots of dirt and peat moss. If you can get your hands on some mix in a few tablespoons of peat Moss. This helps retain water but also aids drainage.Ferns are tough cause they are the plants that sit in the mud on the forest floor but also need water whisked away from their roots quickly in between rains. They also use all the rotten leaf matter nitrates on the ground for food so they get cranky with old nutrientleached dirt.  I think of them as old grandmaa who complain but are still fun to have around. Good luck! And pet Taco for me!,marijuanaenthusiasts,dddc9o4,2,t5_2uzej

11020916,0,t3_5xct8q,cant tell you the species.but the pruning method is called pollarding.basically you cut it back to the same point every  years which created the lump on the ends. its an old farming technique that was originally used to produce leaves for animal feed over winter.its very popular in europe but americans seem to hate it and consider it ugly though Ill agree this specific specimen is not very good. but if its done correctly theres no rot and a pollarded tree can live much longer than a free growing tree.Here is an album I made with pictures of some pollarded trees in my area.,marijuanaenthusiasts,deh6v7y,3,t5_2uzej
11148881,0,t1_devgmxq,The problem with invasive species isnt complaining neighbors its ecosystem destruction. The reason a lot of invasive species are even an issue is because the first person in an area to have one cared more about the single plant than all the other beneficial plants in the area that would be outcompeted and die off.Bush honeysuckle is a good example of this. People liked the scented flowers and bright red berries but when you plant one in your yard it very quickly spreads to adjacent woodlands. Once it takes over the understory there the other berries that native birds eat go extinct and then most of the native songbirds have to move away for lack of food. The plant gets so thick in the understory that nothing else that grows can poke through so native trees are not replaced as they age out. Eventually the deeprooted tall trees are gone and even the water quality in the area suffers. Sure it takes a while but it is a direct result of people not considering ecosystem destruction.This same kind of thing can happen where youre at. It happened near my place with Chinese Privet. For the sake of your local ecosystems health I wish you would reconsider keeping this particular tree. I know it has sentimental value but probably so do all the local native plants as a whole right? As well as a societal value for everyone?,marijuanaenthusiasts,devpp8p,9,t5_2uzej
