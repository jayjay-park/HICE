9598182,0,t1_d9w61rg,You could compensate for that by making resources more scarce though. If Im doing double damage I dont need the same amount of bullets and having fewer means actually hitting my targets is more important and that Ill need to consider whether its worth shooting things like radroaches instead of using a melee weapon instead when feasible. The Metro series does a great job balancing realistic postapocalyptic scarcity without nerfing combat or survival difficulty so it absolutely can be done.,FO4ImmersiveGameplay,d9w67he,2,t5_3gjth
9695026,0,t1_da81r52,Thanks for the reportWeapons patch is up and version RC I altered a lot of levelled lists but havent touched filling cabinets but I will do this mod moves anything you would want into safes so you have to look after your bobypins I would advise moving FLO infront of this patch so you can benifit from both let me know of anything that doesnt feel right and Ill fix it .,FO4ImmersiveGameplay,da8492y,2,t5_3gjth

9720457,0,t1_dab31v2,OkJust had a short conversation with the author of live dismemberment which made things more complicatedDeathclawalpha I have never posted a mod to Bethnet and I never will.Which means the pc version and the Bethesda versions are different...I dont like to step into the realms of other moddersUnless its minor things like powerlines.. But what you guys think? A standalone patch for IG? ,FO4ImmersiveGameplay,dab9am6,3,t5_3gjth
9772914,0,t3_5f4yhu,When starting a new game i end up with  specials and cant accept because i cant distribute negatives quadruple checked and i have no other mod affecting perks or specials only happens with the hardcore patch,FO4ImmersiveGameplay,dahq7qy,2,t5_3gjth

9875060,0,t3_5gaxlj,I shall look into the mercenary pack mod for a merge patch in the next few days. I Always run in the prewar sanctuary always did and at normal speed not IG speed. When sprinting Ap drain depends on Endurance the higher your endurance the lower your AP drain speed depends on agility higher values will make you move faster sometimes too faster perhaps. Walking backward is much slower tpp above all unsheating weapons... And speed is higher also for creatures and enemies.. try avoiding a deathclaw charge hehehe... Thirst hunger and other needs times depend on timescale it is set to  to make the day long closer to real time this means that the need to sleep eat and sleep will be apparently not as frequent as before but it is not so it is only a consequence of timescale at  instead of . Basement has always been there I am playing without it and its harder out there I cant face everything. Even those bloatflies in Sanctuary can be lethal.. I dont use VATS much anymore but yes AP is very very high lowering might be nice without going back to vanilla because IG world is different and AP saved me lot of times. ,FO4ImmersiveGameplay,dauqrym,2,t5_3gjth
9943585,0,t1_db3o0l2,Doombased weapons and anti materiel rifle show up on weapon wielding NPCs..Fusion gun on synth coursers the Ma AMR on a special encounter.only the AS Vektor wont I havent seen any npc with it can be bought on weapon merchants though.

10369045,0,t3_5mkn80,Im having this problem on PS also. First I must say this mod is great. I have IG IGguns IG HC patch. Current updates. I experimented in Sanctuary leveling then maxing previous relevant perks. Even with the required material from scrapping the town and local areas it gives me a message saying I lack requirements.Can list other mods if needed.,FO4ImmersiveGameplay,dcje60j,1,t5_3gjth
10405443,0,t1_dcj924z,From my experience with IG and Automatron automatron was fully balanced with the season pass recipes for robot components use increased material cost sentry bot torso even requires x cores new weapons dmg seems right arc gun is semi usefull now. Far harbor seemed fine too no bullet sponges even new enemy types. The . rounds are balanced i presume as the dmg is around a . win bolt action dmg. I use PA so the weak Marine assault helmet went unoticed but the chest seems buffed tho no ? Nuka World is probably least balanced. Ive read someone here mention  dmg on the Hand made assualt rifle and its . rounds unique to Nuka world. However in my game its dmg is right there with the . AKs from modern firearms. But that could be because of the MF compatibility patch?The Gator claws are totally broken lol. Even with headshots it takes  xmm rounds at dmg each or . rounds from a gatling gun lol. Meanwhile even with  kinda cheated lol total armor rating X O PA i still get OHKd at  END and  perks in Adamantium skeleton. Also the cave crickets seem a bit spongy but they dont hit like a fat man either lol,FO4ImmersiveGameplay,dcnivtj,1,t5_3gjth
10565268,0,t1_dd5n1vp,Then they should be fine in theory as long as they dont adjust the race values. Ill try and have a look at some point  once Ive finished tweaking weapons. ,FO4ImmersiveGameplay,dd5oy2y,1,t5_3gjth
10692222,0,t1_ddi9dc1,Personally I dont tent to take perks as it automatically unbalances the game. Erizike did a good job at removing a lot of the overpowered ones and removing damage amplifies Ill go through them mainly reducing anything that removes the challenge of surviving. Ive removed the damage from luck and the speed from agility and strength. Ive put sneak attack back in at . and I may add back in Damage perks to compensate for removing it from luck. Ive also reduced the damage of the high tear weapons guass rifle  cal and mini guns so there is the additional room for such perks. I want to put strong back in with vanilla steps now I have simplified the junk and component tables. And reduce carry weight by about  I want to remove the  Rad resident  perk and bring the glowing see to manageable figures as I feel this is to hard a counter and would like to bring in radiation marks instead.  What perks do you think are still overpowered? ,FO4ImmersiveGameplay,ddito2x,1,t5_3gjth

11014120,0,t3_58y0mo,Is there any possibility to mod that theres same feature in all weapons than sniper rifles?? It would be so cool if aiming with all weapons gonna be harder.. like snipers theres should be somekind movement just smaller scale but still.. i like those fps games where this feature shows.. and also in this game but u have to be crippled XD,FO4ImmersiveGameplay,degf41z,1,t5_3gjth
11080298,0,t1_denshbv,At timescale  you need  meals and  liters of water a day. I havent looked at the hard patch so not sure how it would work with SHC. ,FO4ImmersiveGameplay,denxx0h,2,t5_3gjth

Ive checked that and there was many updates after i last time tried it out like more speed.. i need to give it a new try.Edit well i cant get it work properly with shc or madness damage mod.. it changes damage values and with different load orders it doesnt work.. it feels lot better than before though..,FO4ImmersiveGameplay,dg5km9d,1,t5_3gjth
