851625,0,t3_23uoza, Apr Pool will be down for maintenance and security audit.The pool will be down for maintenance and a security audit.As some of you may heard a big string of pools got hacked via a malware coin dafuqcoin.Big pools like scryptominers were completely compromised.Our pool is  unaffected by the trojan and we did not get hacked. Even if we were to run the coin our wallet user account does not have root priveleges and the exploit would not be able to execute.We did notice some suspicious activity on our scrypt stratum server so we have taken the pool down to perform a security audit. This can last anywhere from  hours as we have to confirm everything is legit. Walletsmined coins are unaffected by this. The mined coins are safe and sound and have been liquidated and turned in to BC. We will pay out once our security audit is complete and we can be sure that we are paying to the correct people. The SHA payouts will be slightly delayed because of this but will go out as normal.Shortly after the exploit hit and scryptominers was hijacked some one began to bully coin networks with about  Gigahashes of mining power. We turned off our profit switching formula and pointed the pool at some of the coins in trouble to provide some relief and security to their networks as well as push along some blocks that were stuck.News is still coming in its hard to confirm what is legitimate and what is signal noise. We are taking all possible precautions. We apologize for the inconvenience and will update as soon as we have more news. Legion Development Group,blackcoin,ch131vz,3,t5_2zzen

Its likely that niche users would want to spend their BC anyway. However Whole Foods could offer  off to shoppers at the outset. Thus shoppers have incentive to spend BC if they have it inquire about BC if they dont.  The key would be getting the payment device to be seamless. Nobody in NYC has time to muck about.

917872,0,t1_ch8h9yp,It might be more costefficient to distribute the cards to MIT undergrads maybe grads as well not sure on the enrollment s  and they would already have Bitcoins to exchange if they desired.  Im sure Iconic would provide the cards for far less than  each since it would be a massive single order and could be shipped far more efficiently.  If they were  each at this quantity that would mean around  which would be within our range but someone would have to contact Iconic to find out how much money it would take for  cards.

1049484,0,t3_264lyb,Yes. Besides that the boat is still very young PoS is better then PoW. Let me explain that a little more.Proof of Stake means that you gain interest on the amount of Blackcoin you hold while staking. Proof of Work means you gain Bitcoin over the complex algorithms you have to solve which costs ALOT of computing powerenergy. At some point PoW will not be interesting anymore because the computing power costs more money then the profit gained from solving algorithms. Hence everybody will stop mining which then means the network becomes insecure since the computing power is used to secure the open ledger. With that being said mining is spended energy which is bad for mother nature aswell. Proof of Stake is far superior then Proof of Work and since the boat is still very young Blackcoin has very much potential of being the superior cryptocurrency.EDIT also the confirmation time on Blackcoin is very very fast. A lot better for day to day use.,blackcoin,chnkxe8,7,t5_2zzen

This is a normal working dude hes not dumb hes just a normal working dude.. THis was about  months ago so well in to .. I look at these coin sites barf so many people fancy up their coin home page yet offer nothing special or different really. Or if they do YES! Its something so microrelevant that I could barf. Such as the number of coins or some other computer language thing.. I KNOW HOT SHIT about computers meaning nothing!!! But I understand trading from experience in the stock market and education. Ive studied technicals and some fundamental accounting basics but besides that none of it meaqns much because I cant even buy a coin unless I grew up on code or spend  hours trying to figure every little detail out and how this or that works etc. BIG THANK YOU TO  DZIMBECK hes an old friend of mine and helped me understand the basics which at that point I realized I dont need to know how whats happening or why an address wokrs etc. as long as I can learn how to buy and how to sell one. The basics are that currently this coin is of value for trades and purchases of USD several other currencies and also goods and services. NEXT heres how I buy one heres how i store it and heres how I convert back to USD. BIG SHOUT OUT to CoinBase theyve made it pretty simple and understandable for the most part but so many sites like BTCE. WTF you think anyone besides the computercoding community could understand that?! THe winner is the coin who can into the most peoples hands be some what safe and dependable I say somewhat because its important to me but ultimately not the most important aspect is EASILY CONVERTIBLE ATMs ACH sites credit or debit card purchaseable etc. thats it..

PoS is definitely a larger portion of the future than PoW if only for the environmental i.e. energy and economic i.e. ASIC arms race aspects. PoW diehards boast of the network security yet every few months it seems a mega pool threatens  with LTC DOGE and recently BTC.

Dividends will either be distributed proportionately in NXT or the shares transferred over to counterparty or a future asset exchange for distribution.  At the moment BlackCoin received will have to be exchanged for NXT or BTC and distributed.

4091524,0,t1_crmlf0e,gtIm also not sure if the current SHA pool which currently has a hashpower of  THs would impact the percentage I would getThe size of the pool or your percentage of it shouldnt really affect your average payouts.  The only difference is a larger pool will have a bit less randomness.  A larger pools mines more blocks but each share is a smaller percentage of the total averaging out.This is a very slight oversimplification because a larger pool cant allocate too much of its resources to some smaller coins without raising the difficulty of those coins lowering profitability.If you want to support the blackcoinpool purchasing a different miner for a different algorithm could be better.  Maybe someone on IRC might have some suggestions not sure if the blackcoinpool IRC is active or if people just use the regular blackcoin one but the pool devs used to be around on there frequently.,blackcoin,crmnq5a,1,t5_2zzen

5363826,0,t3_3oci4e,Notes For anyone using this tool who has never imported a private key before a few pointers might be helpful. Use this tool to derive your addresses and their corresponding priv keys by entering your word passphrase and setting BIP derivation path to m This will yield a sequence of public addresses. Read down from the top of the list this is the order in which your HD wallet generates pub keys so the addys you used will start from the top.  For each public address you will see a corresponding private key in the neighboring column. Highlight copy amp paste your used addys and their priv keys into a text editor and close out of the tool. Open and sync the wallet client you will be importing into. Note For the import operation you will need to fully UNLOCK your wallet not just for staking only but completely. Having done that go to HelpgtDebug window console tab. You will be using the importprivkey command as followsimportprivkey ltprivkeygoesheregt ltlabelgt true leaving out the ltgtltgt dohickies.Hit enter. Your wallet will immediately begin a rescan and the gui will appear to hang  dont worry its just working on the rescan. BE PATIENT this can easily take  mins or more. Youll see when its done and that your import is reflected in a new coin balance and corresponding transaction history. Delete console history as your privkey is still showing in plaintext when you get to this point.  Go back to console tab and enter walletlock Lastly clean up well. You dont want to leave those privkeys lying around e.g. in notepad or still in clipboard.,blackcoin,cvxafgz,3,t5_2zzen

6307612,0,t1_cz6ha0h,gt I dont think you have read the link I posted earlier on the calculation of performace fee on highwatermark basis. Oh I did. If this is the industry standard one should use a formula for the explanation. To have vaguely understanding of something and to be able to calculate that are completely different things. Give your and investopedia explanations to  people and you will get  different results. gt I have noticed you have chosen to focus on our worst month in AugustThat the only screenshot Ive made because I was wondering how the gain could be positive with that substantial loss of the current value. As a client I would be more concerned about the current value of the investment. Why does it make any sense to pay a performance fee if the closed trades made  gain but the current value of the open trades is about half of what it was before? The current value is given by the market. The monthly gains are SET by trades because they decide what to close and what not. Closing only positive trades leads always to a positive statistics of monthly gains for good and for bad traders positive every month until bankruptcy. I can tell you that for somebody not from the industry that it is confusing and not as transparent as you might think.  You might be a good trader that is not the point. The better people understand how it works the more likely they blame themselves and not you if the investment doesnt pay off as expected.   ,blackcoin,cz6lrpw,1,t5_2zzen
