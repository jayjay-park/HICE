8659941,0,t3_4yhqii,What if you went with a tug and tow concept?A lot of goods go up and down major waterways think the Mississippi River on barges towed by tugboats. The barges have very simple construction and all of the tricky bits and crew are in the tugboat. Your submersible barges would need to be hydrodynamic and have some ability to adjust their ballast to submerge and surface. They could get towed by a cable that was retrofitted into a submarines towed array reel and the whole shebang could still serve the function of the towed array as a passive sonar. Finally while it would be complex to build in refrigeration given the coldness of most sea temperatures the barge could act like a root cellar   degrees F is good enough to keep staples like potatoes and apples from spoiling. ,submarines,d6o3x8k,3,t5_2s3g2

11753571,0,t3_67p8fq,Movie SONAR  and real SONAR are nothing like each other. As a former submariner all Ive ever heard is SONAR from surface ships that has come through the hull. It isnt very reverby. Its also typically not a single tone but rather a set of different tones in sequence. From a surface ships perspective youd be hearing sound from the transmission and from the return. There isnt  just a single source of reflected sound either. Sound is returned by everything in the water column including the water itself so there is going to be spread in the freq responce amplitude Doppler and all sorts of good stuff. What it will never be is a bell like clear tone. Perhaps all those parameters add up to something similar to reverb. Or maybe there is reverb that is hard to hear from inside a sub. Im sure a SONAR dude will comment.,submarines,dgsaoz3,7,t5_2s3g2
