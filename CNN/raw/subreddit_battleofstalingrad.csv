10087091,0,t3_5k8g8o,Id go with BoS first and if youre really into it pick up the others.Cliffs is fun always cheap to pick up and I fly there occasionally but prefer BoS because of how outdated Cliffs is and their engine. BoM have some enjoyable aircraft too like the MiG Mc I P. Looking forward to the A and lend lease American aircraft in Battle of Kuban like the A and P.My  cents.,battleofstalingrad,dbmd69c,1,t5_2xsja
11048758,0,t3_5xqwya,Yes its alive.  And there are not any big issues.  Right now I dont think there are even any real issues at all.  Since the devs adjusted the FWs FM no one has had anything to complain about.  As far as mulitplayer combat flight sims go this is probably one of the most popular.  War Thunder excluded because its not really a flight sim.  DCS is good but they are missing a lot of things takes away from immersion.Honestly if you get this game I think you will be satisfied.  When Battle of Kuban comes out at the end of the year there will be a bunch of new aircraft lots of American lendlease aircraft and then next theater will be the pacific.  So a lot going on thriving community best flightmodels on the market great immersion amazing and responsive dev team and a lot more.  Very much worth the money.,battleofstalingrad,dekcw20,10,t5_2xsja
