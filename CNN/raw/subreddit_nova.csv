241942,0,t1_cf4pelh,Ill be honest I currently work in the greater DC area for a competitor of the Great American Restaurants. Some of our staff came from GAR restaurants though Ive never worked for them but a number of my friends have. I do disagree with mentioning GAR in the same sentence as Outback partially because at least I know that GAR are making much of their menu in housefrom scratch sauces etc.. I really doubt thats the case with those chain restaurants.But Im offended that youre bringing Macaroni Grill into this discussion. Some of the food is actually alright but the company is shit and getting worse. I worked at one for over two years a few years agobut not too far in the past. When I became a trainer I was supposed to get paid more when I was training I think minimum wage of .hour but the restaurant I was at never followed that. Also my normal server pay rate was supposed to increase from the federal minimum wage for servers of .hour to .hour. Fifty centshour isnt much but over about  months it adds up. But that also didnt happen.I did have a couple of managers I respected but that place was going downhill fast. Corporate repeatedly changed the menu and interfered with what actually was selling in that area. They had a policy in which a server started accruing vacation time after one year. A server could get vacation time based on their average declared hourly earning for the previous six months so it was beneficial to take a vacation in the first four months of the year to get the holiday boost. Anyway they still owe me that .hour for  months the hourly boost when training and  hours of vacation time I took about a month before I quit. The general manager never put in for that vacation time because he thought I was going to quit though at the time I was only talking about picking up a second job because I wasnt making enough money. I figure they owe me . A good friend of mine worked their for  years and they still owe him . Were never going to see any of it despite my friend looking into filing a lawsuit because we dont have all the documentation for the hours spent training etc. My friend had over  hours of vacation time hes never going to see. Ill call them out. This is the DullesSterling location by the mall. Ive avoided going there for the past ish years shortly after I quitId occasionally go in to see my friend. Almost all of their top serversbartenders left in a six month span. Im not sure these problems are confined to that location. The kitchen manager still there as of Juneish of last year is cool but Im not sure of anyone else. When I was there they had a habit of giving preference to the young people of this area that still lived with their parents and didnt have to work to pay bills. Bunch of lazy fucks. Actual sentence uttered by a coworker I cant believe my parents are going to make me start paying for my own cell phone smart phone next month. If you arent working to pay bills then I probably dont want you as a coworker. Unless they want to apologize with a check in their hands I dont want to hear it.,nova,cf5tv5h,1,t5_2riyy

477849,0,t1_cfu590d, gt  years ago or so no one was ever talking about issues or money when it came to peering.I had a frontrow seat for the industrywide pissing contest over peering that went on the late s and it was entirely about money.  Smaller ISPs wanted settlementfree peering with the larger ones even when the amount of traffic was lopsided which it was most of the time.  The large ISPs who were in the transitforsale business were understandably reluctant to switch to a transitforfree business model.  Heres a slide deck from the spring  NANOG with some background.  Those disagreements and the threat of federal regulation are why ISPs learned to play nice and explicitly lay out their peering policies.  Here for example are Verizons policies  Take careful note of section ..Whats going on right now is that the CogentVerizon peerings thats plural theres more than one are running well in excess of the . ratio in Cogents favor.  In other words Cogent is delivering a lot more traffic to Verizon than is coming the other way.  Peerings are supposed to be meetings of equals and Verizons policy defines exactly what that means.  Once you get away from equal its transit.  Thats why you pay your ISP for transit and dont simply peer with them.Both companies knew what the terms were before they signed an agreement to peer and both companies have the engineering data to know exactly what their traffic levels are.  Cogent isnt holding up its end of the bargain.  Verizon which has spent a lot of time looking the other way for the benefit of its own customers because they already had a fat lessthansaturated pipe in place has put its foot down.Cogent doesnt want to pay for transit on the overage because that would cut into their own profits.  In other words they are doing everything in their power to make sure someone besides them pays for this.  They also knew very well this was going to happen eventually and took the risk of doing it on the cheap.  Cogent is now bemoaning the situation in public as if it were some kind of crisis and is conveniently leaving out the fact that they were given an inch on their Verizon peerings but took a yard. gt All Netflix traffic comes over Cogent if you dont ugprade the Cogent pipe seems like a pretty cheap easy way to do it.Not anymore it doesnt.  Netflix recently signed a paid transit deal with Comcast and as of last week has a direct connection to their network.  Rumors are flying that a similar deal with Verizon is in the works.Why did Nefflix cave and pay?  Simple  they figured out that they were paying Cogent for transit but Cogent was unable or unwilling to pony up the additional costs of delivering all of its traffic to Verizon.  Thats like FedEx taking your money to deliver your packages but throwing some of them in the trash because they ran out of airplanes and didnt want to spend money on more.  Netflix was probably able to make the business case that continuing to depend on Cogent for transit to their customers ISPs is no longer a viable path and that shifting some of the transit expenditures directly to Comcast would help them attract and keep customers.  Thats why I think youll see deals with Verizon Cox ATampT and others sooner rather than later.  The loser in this is Cogent but they have only themselves to blame. gt If Verizon was actually worried about playing fair theyd be all for net neutrality.This isnt a neutrality problem.  If Cogent were able to attract enough traffic from Verizon that the peerings stayed within the agreedupon ratio I have no doubt that Verizon would have upgraded them without batting an eye.  These kinds of peering upgrades happen all the time with little fanfare because theyre mutually beneficial. gt I was simply implying they dont want to fix the Cogent issue because of Netflix.The only party that doesnt want to fix the Cogent issue is Cogent.  Netflix happened to be the highprofile catalyst that brought everything to a boil because most of its traffic goes in one direction.  Heck in terms of video subscribers Comcast has five times more interest than Verizon in seeing that Netflix doesnt succeed and they still sold Netflix direct access to its customers. gt ...which is probably why you believe that Verizon doesnt have it out for Netflix.I dont doubt for a minute that Verizon would much rather be raking in Netflixs revenue themselves.  But I also dont believe theyre foolish enough to pull a stunt that would piss off the people paying the bills for all of the residential fiber theyve put in over the last decade.  I live in a market where theres Comcast coax and Verizon fiber at my door and could switch ISPs by the end of the week if Verizon pissed me off enough to do business with Comcast.,nova,cful1ot,3,t5_2riyy

Its not like they actually make your passport at the post office all they do is take your application and send it to the State Department.You can pay State to expedite your passport but its pricey .  That will get it done faster and you can still mail it in.You can also go to the Passport Agency in DC directly if you need a passport within  weeks which also costs  and involves standingwaiting around in line plus the general pain in the ass of going to the Agency in DC itself.  But heres the info if you want to do that.EDIT  Realized maybe you are not renewing a passport but are actually getting one done for the first time.  That might require an appointment I guess for them to review your documents and certify everything.  Ive never not had a passport within living memory so not really sure what the deal is with that.  If you have a passport even an expired one you can do the whole thing by mail and I dont see why youd need to get an appointment at the post office ... just get the photo taken wherever and include it with the application DS and then you are just mailing it out.,nova,ci38ldc,2,t5_2riyy

When this happens it makes it nearly impossible to tell if they are actually aware of their surroundings let alone that vehicle is coming up behind them.  I try not to shadow bikers and just give them a wide berth when possible but if I know Im about to get into a really busy area or an area with really terrible pavement which the biker might have to swerve around I am totally fine with keeping my speed low until Im past that point.,nova,cjgr50y,6,t5_2riyy

1659503,0,t1_cjoc0o6,gt Is there literally anything I could say that would convince you this isnt a big deal or are you deadset on being upset?When you have a pet thats stolen come back and tell me its not a big deal. People cared for this animal and someone thought that it was ok to steal him if you think thats ok then you dont obviously dont understand the law and I hope nobody ever trusts you to take care of anything.gtAlso since children arent dogs your analogy sucked. By trying to compare dogs and children you were saying children were dogs. Thats literally what you just did. The whole point of an analogy is to provide parallel reasoning to help draw the same conclusion but that doesnt work if the reasoning would be different in the two differing scenarios.I was comparing the actions. You seem to think that the person that took this dog was doing it out of benevolence or ignorance and that theyre probably fit to take care of the dog otherwise. I was asking you if in the same scenario where a benevolent person who has all the best intentions in the world were to kidnap a child would you be ok with that? It has nothing to do with the importance of what is being taken and everything to do with following the letter of the law. The analogy is not about whats being taken its about how its being taken. To many people pets really are just as important as children but to you its obviously not the case but that doesnt negate my analogy. You also seem to fail to realize that Im talking about unwanted children who society has already deemed as less important . Im not talking about taking a kid from a home where theyre wanted Im talking about taking them from a home where everything is provided by the state and they most likely dont have anyone that cares for them more than they would for a pet.,nova,cjoccz7,1,t5_2riyy

2827111,0,t3_2sg3l6,The killer for me is student loans.  Ive always lived with roommates and until a few months ago didnt have a car even living in Herndon... but I came from the NYCmetro for college and have a high tolerance for public transport  and got a lot of ridicule for it here and possibly some lostmissed connections but so be it.  I had a very good starting salary out of college IT  Computer Engineering major otherwise Id have not been staying afloat.  But I realize that a month student loan payment is atypical.  That said I still try to be as reasonable as possible  I put away  off the top to k so that I dont touch it and thats built up nicely in   years.  My budgeting rule is Try to only go over budget for the year what youre going to get back in tax refunds unless the experience is really really worth it.  Work afforded me a few very nice travel opportunities I otherwise couldnt have seized upon and I afforded myself one or two others.  Without that I would be probably saving even more but I would also be going crazy.  Its a fine balance between finding things you love to do if thats not just your job and making it work in your budget.  But even in my own companyformer company I saw them lowering starting salaries into that xK range and I was genuinely wondering how people were affording to live here.  Personally I think theres a lot of old money getting interns and younger starters by in their highrent apartments in the ClarendonBallstonCrystal CityDCs of the world if for no other reason than the sense of entitlement around here amongst somethings tends to be off the charts high even compared to NYC I went to college in Hoboken NJ.  Roommates is the best thing you can do for your budget though in all seriousness.  Im living in Ballston right now literally a  minute walk from the Metro station for .  Simply no other way thats possible and frankly even this is a very good deal.  I was paying  in Herndon with a roommate.  But it more than makes up for it in commuting costs and time saved.  The trick when you save time is to make sure you dont engage in activities that waste money such as buying too many snacks or going out to drink too much.,nova,cnpfrin,5,t5_2riyy

Even in indirect light the brows will shade the eyes giving them a dull dead look.  The pro trick to prevent this is to stand on something  feet off the ground and get the looking up into the light.  Just pay close attention to the eyes relative to how bright the forehead  cheekbones are.  Also using flash on camera at low power i.e. short duration will add catchlights to the eyes without overpower the natural modeling.  Lots more tips on rHolisticPhotography,nova,co469jm,2,t5_2riyy

Think of your car  if one garage or dealership screws you theres no law against going somewhere else for repairs. A good pedorthist can probably fix your orthotics for you. Or get a new set as you sound like youve already resigned yourself to that possibility.The part that many foot docs dont tell you about fasciitis as with many other foot pains it is entirely possible to get relief without ever going to the doctor.

However the debate around what happens outside the beltway should have some compromise room Im unsure what areas theyve discussed in the past.  I assume the airport comment refers to Alexandria City.  I think thats due primarily to a variance in the flight paths recently which the residents would indeed have a bit of a leg to stand on.I agree that folks like those in McLean were there first.  But long term that argument only goes so far.  The population is growing here regardless of that and those folks Arlington with the we cant expand i mantra and the like are going to have to give a bit on something.

4606273,0,t3_3e16bf,Echo the folks who say you ideally want to get to BWI or DCA as those are both very near or directly along the rail line.  Whats nice about going from DCA is that youd take the train to King Street from Reagan National and pick up the Amtrak at Alexandria and thats probably a bit cheaper than going from BWI or even possibly Union Station.  Do be aware though that there are not many runs that go through Virginia the majority of the trains stop at Union.  You might look into getting into Union Station and seeing if there is a cheap bus as well especially if you have someone who can get you once you are in Richmond.   Try MegaBus BoltBus and Greyhound.  Out of curiosity Im assuming you dont have a car?  Yes the . hour trek since it was  for me from Arlington gt Toronto would suck but its actually not an unpleasant drive and definitely would be cheaper we have super cheap gas here compared to you guys PRichmond is pretty much not worth flying into sadly as youve found out.  ,nova,ctb7etd,1,t5_2riyy

4986843,0,t3_3j88c9,This doesnt apply to me I like where I live and manage to skirt the worst traffic most of the time but I can give you a couple of reasons why based on my experience. Business climate  A lot of people that live and work in Northern Virginia work in some related capacity with the Federal govt either as a contractor or directly as an employee. On the contractor end its very highvolume highmovement work environment especially around this time of year and unless youre a typeA personality that can stay cool under pressure and not mind working long hours it may not be the most ideal environment. If youre lucky you work in an efficient low stress environment but that seems to be the lucky few. Some of this can be said for being a direct Fed but in addition Feds most of the time MUST be on site meaning a huge stressful commute which brings me to my next point.. Traffic  As you may have heard the DC area has now beaten out NYC and LA as having the worst traffic in the country. You can leave at  AM and still be sitting in traffic for an hour depending on where you are going and where you are coming from. This has equal parts to due with the sheer human congestion areas Annandale Fairfax Arlington etc. and the fact that the civil infrastructure cannot efficiently accommodate that congestion all leaving at once and going to many of the same areas for work. A lot of the people making the civil engineering decisions pertaining to the interstate and interloop renovation are not civil engineers but political appointees and financial stakeholders. Until better and less dangerous public transportation can be funded and erected this is going to continue to be a worsening problem.. The Metro   years ago taking metro to work wasnt all that terrible. But that was before the infrastructure began to degrade. I rode metro in to Ballston for about  years and every day was a burden from the overcrowded cars to the incomprehensible speakers to the brakes that smelled like fish and Im just dreading that the train is going to come to a grinding halt underground and sit there for  minutes while my  AM meeting starts. Ive spoken with lots of friends and coworkers that have simply stopped taking the metro because they A dont want to be caught in a tunnel for  minutes with no explanation and B dont want to run the risk of dying of smoke inhalation. The underfunding and consequent mismanagement of Metro hasnt helped to instill confidence on that front so this may also be a gradually worsening situation.But the most pronouncedyetunderstated issue. Ill call it environmental sterility for lack of a better term. Its strip malls and corporate franchise as far as the eye can see. Its something I have not seen anywhere else except the less wealthy Middle America and the deep south. State law from what I know of it seems to make it very difficult for independent businesses to thrive and the cost of land and property taxes alone in this part of the state make it a steep and risky venture. Its to the point where I get excited about a new coffee shop that isnt a PeetsStarbucksmisc. franchise and any other independent business that isnt the  millionth garagegas station of the area. Its subtle but people like variety and it does weigh on the psyche of people when theres nothing warm or personal about your environment. Its like living in a neighborhood with no trees and all you have is a few balding patches of dead grass.,nova,cun3l0j,39,t5_2riyy

He exploded multiple times while talking to whomever was on the other side of the line... and admitted to being unhunged. That person can testify if needed as to the apparent state of mind of the caller which would spell doom for him.Assault is defined as threatening physical harm against another and having the ability and means to imminently carry through with that threat. Granted that is a watered down simplistic explanation other factors like body language tone of voice etc etc come into play in court... and he hit every one of those other factors as well... but by the bare bones legal definition of assault in VA he meets the criteria for an arrest at the very least to let the courts find guilt or innocence.In Road Rage incidents VA charges and convicts under the Aggressive Driving laws. This may meet the criteria to arrest and charge him under those laws as well but I am less familiar with that section of VA law.,nova,cvv8erm,8,t5_2riyy

Just to give you an idea I got there a little later than planned at  for the  showing and I ended up in the way back of the line. I stood no chance at any middle seat. They started to let people in to get seats at  about. I guess it depends on when you can get tickets though. If you go at a time when they havent sold out the theater probably dont have to go as early. To buy tickets you can go here Thats where I bought mine. I wouldnt have known about without ufartcars reddit post a month ago. Also there is a weird seat in that theater. Once you enter the theater looking towards the seating the seat on the far left on the top row has a railing right in front of it.

Its like they were all trained at it.  I would bet anything that theres a panhandling pimp behind it all who takes a cut.  Police here have broken up fights over territory they have seen them get into a car and drive away they get calls all the time about harassment.  The girl who stands on the corner here all day walks over to the nice apartment complex across the street while looking at her smartphone when shes done.  Her sign says that shes homeless with an infant.  IF YOU ARE ABLEBODIED and can stand outside in the elements for eight hours every day you can damn well get a real job you shit!The fact is there are social services for the homeless and shelters.  If you really want to throw money at the problem donate to them not to individual scum at a traffic median.

6610891,0,t3_465zzt,Bike commuting in this area is great.  Its very well established in DCArlingtonAlexandriaFalls Church.  Fairfax County is a little further behind but theyre quickly adopting bikefriendly policies.  For instance Capital Bikeshare will soon be coming to both Reston and Tysons. Despite that many parts of Fairfax County are still caroriented suburbia so if you plan to bike commute from out there youll need safe access to the WampOD Trail.  Possibly consider adding the Fairfax County Parkway Trail into the mix if you want WampOD access at a cheaper price point than Reston. Points further south close to the Mt. Vernon Trail which follows the Potomac also have easy access to DC.From the WampOD Trail getting to DC is a breeze. Youd pick up the trail at mile marker  or so in Reston and head east.  Youd probably take WampODCustisMt.VernonMemorial Bridge to get into DC so riding to the White House is probably  miles or so one way from Reston.  Thats probably on the upper limit of doable though Id prefer something a little shorter in the lt mile range if you can do it.  Hills arent too bad the WampOD is a former rail line so they intentionally designed it to avoid hills.Finally if you do make the move check out rbikeDC.

7185153,0,t3_4dtnnl,Im not a lawyer licensed in Virginia but I am a lawyer...in Virginia.This is not advice its just a thought on a social media website.In Virginia real and personal property acquired before the marriage is classified as separate meaning that it is excluded from the equitable distribution of assets during divorce.In this case if these houses in question were purchased prior to marriage it would seem that they would fall under this separate category.  However there is some serious nuance to this.  Some property can be considered to fall both into marital and separate categories.  For example any increase in the value of separate property could be considered to be subject to equitable distribution to the extent that marital assets contributed to the increase in value.  So for example if you made substantial improvements to a premarriage house after you were married any increase in the value of the house that could be attributable to that improvement could be considered marital property.  Also personal effort on the part of the spouse can factor into the analysis of whether the premarriage property is subject to equitable distribution.  This can be things like labor effort inventiveness physical or intellectual skill creativity or managerial promotional or marketing activity.  You can see that this is pretty vague.  If your soontobeexhusband put any effort into maintaining the property into improving the property into furnishing the property and so on then the value attributed to that effort as it is retained by the asset can be considered marital property and can therefore be subject to the equitable distribution of assets during a divorce.  Were not talking  for mowing the lawn every Saturday were talking substantial efforts that result in substantial increases in value.  Putting in a new kitchen kind of effort.Of course theres also the question of where mortgage payments were coming from during the marriage.  I assume that you were sharing accounts and therefore sharing bills  I imagine that marital money was being used to pay these two mortgages.  If your incomes are approximately the same and the mortgage bills were approximately the same then it might be a wash  if these variables are substantially different which from your facts I feel that your premarriage houses mortgage might be a bit more then there could be an argument that whatever proportion was paid towards the mortgage is marital property.So it sounds like your lawyer is probably right.  A portion of your premarriage house could be considered marital property and be subject to equitable distribution.Sure there could be an argument depending highly on facts you havent provided that your premarriage house is PURELY separate property.  Maybe its worth making the argument even if the facts dont fall in your favor.  These are all tactics taken in a divorce.  This is because ultimately divorce is a negotiation  its possible that your soontobeexhusband and his attorney are just playing the long game and trying to get as much as possible from an unpleasant situation.Regardless it sounds like this is going to be a contentious and frustrating divorce process.  Hopefully the lawyer youve hired is good at hisher job.Happy divorcing!,nova,d1uw0xv,5,t5_2riyy
7185515,0,t1_d1ttrcp,My understanding was always that you could refuse a field breathalyzer test but then would probably be arrested taken to the police station and asked to take a breathalyzer there which is the one you are legally bound to take.  If you refuse THAT one that is when you imply selfincrimination and get your license taken away for some time but avoid an actual DUI.From personal experience this seems to be the case.  Story time is anyone caresI was driving  over on Lee Hwy cop FLIES up behind me after an intersection and begins to ride my ass.  I use my turn signal and shift to the other lane thinking he has places to be and Im in his way.  He paces me.  Couple intersections later I turn signal again to shift back over in front of him then one more lane over into the left turn lane for my turn into my neighborhood.He turns on his lights and pulls me over.  Asks if Ive been drinking and how many yes  drinks over past  hours.  Had me get out of car and do drunk tests walk the line etc.  Everything goes fine then he walks back to his car and returns with a breathalyzer and asks do you want to take a breathalyzer?  why would I want to?  do you want to take a breathalyzer?  Officer Im not drunk and didnt fail any of your tests did I?  no why are you asking me to take a breathalyzer?  do you want to take a breathalyzer?  No I dont want to ... And he immediately grabs me and starts cuffing me which I calmly resist and calmly say Officer why are you arresting me?  If you told me I would be arrested for declining a breathalyzer I would take it can I take it now?  Stop resisting.  You had your chance.  I was never trying to play semantics he just literally only ever asked repeatedly if I wanted to take a breathalyzer.Takes me back to the station and I blow well under the . limit.  He tries to tell the magistrate reckless driving due to combination of speeding and alcohol.  I ended up going to court and getting it reduced to a minor traffic infraction to the cops great dismay.  Dickless power tripping shit eater didnt even make eye contact with me in court. ,nova,d1uxihg,1,t5_2riyy

However places like merrifield which are within a stones throw of  and have actual active pedestrianfocused development in full swing are going to be fine especially compared with some of the more downmarket disconnected neighborhoods ITB.     Youll also be a shorter trip timewise to DC if youre walkable to the orange line vs a  minute ride on a bus that comes every half hour just to get to the train.Its not a bad rule overall but there are exceptions to every rule.FWIW I used to live right behind merrifield garden center and my GF could make it to the yard in about half an hour though she was driving.

8045727,0,t3_4peia1,I believe the officer should have given you another yellow sheet alongside the Virginia Uniform Summons sheet whichll show what the individual penalties are and how to pay them by mail or something. Alternatively you can check your fine size by going to the General District Online Case Information System pop in the county or city where you got that ticket it should say on your Virginia Uniform Summons and search for your name. Make sure you get the correct date and the violation that matches the ticket. You can prepay there if you want as well but keep in mind that a creditdebit payment also tacks on a  convenience fee. If it were a normal ticket youre looking at   mph over limit. If it were speeding in a school or work zone then its mph instead of . However if it were speeding in certain signposted residential zones under law section on your Virginia Uniform Summons thisll be .. you dun fucked up. Itll be the  base plus  per mile over limit plus .  On top of any fines youll get  demerit points on your license. If you hit  in one year or  in two years youll get a nastygram from the DMV but no penalty. If you hit  in one year or  in two years youll be required to take a driver safety course.  in one year or  in two years is an automatic license suspension. However the points only stick around for two years since the date of infraction so no need to worry there yet. Heck if youve been driving around for the last couple years without incident you might not even need to really worry about points since you can accumulate up to  safe driving points for every year you dont get a ticket.

8090734,0,t3_4pym7r,Thats not a terrible idea. The only thing I used BampN for in the last  years was to meet people or spend afternoons there browsings through books. Not buying books but sitting at the cafe looking through books or magazines. Meeting friends discsussing books and so on. The cafe got all my BampN money.  I would rather go there then a smaller coffee shop because I like browsing through books and so do my friends. I saw people meet there. So it is more of a cafe with an attached large book store than a large book store with an attached cafe. Maybe there is some traction with letting people have a glass of wine there.Another point is perhaps in afluent areas people who go there will also not mind buying the book. Maybe those living around One Loudoun dont really care if a book costs  less on Amazon theyll will pay for instant gratification. ,nova,d4ph0ia,3,t5_2riyy

10561786,0,t1_dd4o4zx,I got in touch with Arlington Police and heres what they said gt Drivers must stop for the pedestrian who has control of the crosswalk. No pedestrian shall cross in disregard of approaching traffic...Pedestrians should begin entering crosswalk on walk signal.After showing them the video I asked which party was atfault. They declined to answer.The bottom line for me is if there were to be a collision who would be the atfault party?The way the law reads it appears that that as uEyeLikePie stated correctly the pedestrian has the right of way.However in this case the pedestrian is clearly crossing the street with total disregard of approaching traffic. The pedestrians back is to oncoming traffic and you can clearly see that the pedestrian jumps at  when he realizes a car is approaching. I dont want to turn this into rlegaladvice but I think this situation makes for an interesting conversation. I see it from both sides. Im not sure who would win in court. Driver does not have the rightofway. Pedestrian is disregarding traffic. But what I do know is that without the video its extremely difficult to prove the pedestrians disregard of approaching traffic. The PD also pointed me to this website as a resource. ,nova,dd5aq9d,5,t5_2riyy
