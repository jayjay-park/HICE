Luckily most of Fatah Al Islam leadership has been killed in the Syrian Civil War. gt Beginning in the spring of  Fatah alIslam has reported a small number of attacks in Syria but its leadership has been decimated in recent months.

His health is not very good and there is currently an issue over which person the PUK will choose as President of Iraq. As far as calming the situation then maybe. It is PUK Peshmerga that captured Kirkuk not Barzanis Peshmerga which is very important towards the peace process. Barzanis group are much more hostile and aggressive they are a military dictatorship after all whereas PUK are typically more lawful and democratic.This is very evident in their responses towards Kirkuk Barzanis group believes that Kirkuk is now officially Kurdish territory and will never be returned however PUK realizes that they are only occupying it and that Article  of the Iraqi constitution remains valid AKA it is not officially Kurdish territory until it can be deArabized and a referendum can be held. From this point the most important thing Talibani can do is force Barzanis group to stop harboring and supporting ISIS and their allied tribal leaders.,LevantineWar,cj483j7,1,t5_2xgsh

This strategy worked very well in Libya  look at the complete disaster that country has become since Khadafis ouster and how little media coverage it gets.  So now theyre doing it in SyriaIraq.    It is not possible to win a war like this solely from the air so even if they increased the tempo of air strikes they would accomplish nothing.
