When people took notice that the good reviews were coming from people she datedslept with they questioned the credibility of gaming journalism. She denied the claims and said this was an attack on not only her but women in gaming. Most people dont like her because she turned a cause aimed for one thing corrupt journalism into something totally different oppression of women in gaming and the mainstream media ate it up.,vice,d6vbecf,15,t5_2qx5c
