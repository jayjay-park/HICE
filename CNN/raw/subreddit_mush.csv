645103,0,t1_cgdlgil,I never argued that it was good.  In fact I said it was exploitative.  I argued that it was successfully making money for Twinoid.I dont really feel like arguing but you should realize you are using your own anecdotal evidence against mine.  I told you to take polls on ships which should give you a better idea and raw statistics.Thank you and goodbye.,mush,cgdljzg,0,t5_2r0rc
