202826,0,t1_cf1bryt,I havent read any H.P. Lovecraft books I should keep your recommendation in mind though!Havent played FF but Ive played a bunch of the other Final Fantasies. I agree Tactics was absolutely amazing. Its probably high on my list for the most hours Ive spent on one game. Of those youve mentioned Ive played FF   and  as well. The stories in all of those were good although I probably liked the battle system in  the best. Im not super fond of  just because Zidane really got on my nerves Ive never been fond of his personality type and the final boss in  has just required way too much grinding so Im also slightly annoyed at that one right now too. Out of all the Final Fantasies Ive played Crisis Core would be my favourite. Super fun battle system and the only video game story that has actually ever made me shed tears.Technically Ive cooped in two countries so far. I did my first few terms in Canada and then this past year I got two coops in Seattle. My next coop is likely going to be in either Canada or California. So same continent and culture but I still really do enjoy the chance to experience other cities and become a local. Ive looked into cooping at more exotic locations but the pay and travelvisa complications usually arent worth it. What about you have you traveled around much?,MyLittleFriends,cf1jn43,2,t5_2u6w0

I recently started up the new Thief though. Its pretty good so far havent played many stealth games before. Transistor I have not played but Ive heard good things about it.
