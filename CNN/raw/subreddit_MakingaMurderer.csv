5995528,0,t3_3xkiut,I used to work for an organization that oversaw the assignment of courtappointed attorneys in a different statecounty. Loads of defendants go into court asking for new counsel  times because the lawyer doesnt callvisit frequently enough. It can be hard to distinguish  especially early on  between a client getting poor representation vs. the facts of the case themselves are just shit. And many indigent defendants are not just mentally challenged but seriously mentally ill they could be irrational or even just lack the education or ability to understand that certain choices can have negative legal consequences. It was heartwrenching when the judge denied Dasseys request but I wasnt surprised mostly because of that context.,MakingaMurderer,cy5jm2m,1,t5_3b2cn
5998018,0,t1_cy5uy9k,Im a civil lawyer actually. Although some lawyers take cases on contingency like you said based on the potential payout the contingency only covers the legal service fees. The client typically still has to cover the attorneys costs which is usually a lot more than a few hundred dollars for filing fees. It includes photocopies database research stenographers for depositions private investigators laboratory tests travel etc. Some lawyers will loan the money to the client against an eventual payout but if you do that too often you go broke.To be fair its possible that someone had an insurance policy on the Avery property and there could have been a recovery against that if the Halbachs proved the wrongful death occurred there.

6013674,0,t1_cy7lb4a,That was thoroughly puzzling to me. It was almost like the investigators did not understand the concept of conflict of interest. I mean they announce that Calumet will handle it due to the conflict and then immediately proceeded to ignore conflict of interest protocols and had Mantiwoc intimately involved in the investigation. Then each time significant evidence is found it was by Mantiwoc PD in unusual circumstances.  Conflict of interest means you back out of investigation completely and hand it over to an outside agency and have nothing further to do with it. This was not done at all here. A complete failure in case management that was inexplicable to me.  Had all of the evidence been found by Calumet investigators it would have gone a long way to removing the taint of framing. The police caused their own compromised position by not handling this investigation properly. It was an epic screw up on this point.  ,MakingaMurderer,cy7x5ir,6,t5_3b2cn

6021590,0,t3_3xylq5,You have to understand the enormity of allowing yourself to believe he didnt do it. It involves confronting the fact that your local protectors and guardians are corrupt and self interested. It would involve admitting that this is more a class war fight than a fight for justice. From what Ive read locals in the area seem to be reasonably aware of the class struggle happening in Wisconsin. If youre of privileged background it can be very hard to admit that youre privileged and are actually better off than those under you. Its the whole Capitalism ethos of  if youre not wealthy and successful then its your own fault for being poor and not trying. The poor have large amounts of prejudice to fight as well as a biased judicial system. Once Avery was fingered it was never going to swing in his favor.On top of allowing themselves to admit all that the locals have MASSES of pretrial bias in their minds that theyd need to conquer as well. Local people were more subjected to the fear mongering and skewing through the press than anyone else. The women from ABC news even admits before the trial has happened that right now murder is hot she then goes on to mention the competition between news channels to run this story all knowing that the more gruesome and despicable the details they elaborate on the better for their ratings. For people to then argue that people are being given a skewed version of the events from  hours of documentary footage bewilders me considering theyll sit back and let murder glorifying news agencies dictate their emotions and thoughts on the entire case. The people that claim Avery is guilty tend to rely on their own personal experiences with the prosecutors saying that They are all respectable decent and hardworking people. I mean the sexual harassment cases against Kratz the obvious lying under oath by Lenk and the coercion of Dassey during his interview suggests these men were not respectable and decent in any shape or form. Yet that will get ignored and passed off as irrelevant information by the Avery is Guilty camp. Damning information on Avery such as an argument in a letter he had with his fiance decades prior will get paraded around as if its hard evidence that he he killed Teresa.This whole case is shrouded in lower class prejudice and bullying. What terrifies me greatly is that a PI during the trial had said they need to cut the Avery family tree down and stop the gene pool from spreading. It highlights the brutal attitudes of the privileged people in power there. I really hope that this Doc brings about a serious attitude shift in the local people of the area. ,MakingaMurderer,cy8ycpa,36,t5_3b2cn

6028586,0,t3_3y1zwn,Because the prosecutors knew that going down that path wouldve shed light on a suspect who was in their custody and had substantial evidence on him they never pursued because they were already fully committed to Steven Avery. In the trial facts and testimony prove Teresas inbox was full when she went missing and the brother had testified he had accessed her voicemail on the grounds of finding any information about her last whereabouts. It is also fact that someone with access to her messages deleted some since she went missing. As far as defense they couldve used the cellphone records to pursue a random number for which the investigators had no other suspects or use it to show somebody with access to her messages deleted some after she was reported missing. Fast forward to today and newly discovered evidence places this now key suspect of the crime German man at a house his wife wanted to rent out  minutes down the road from the Averys. Im guessing the constant calls and messages were him asking her to take photographs for the listing. This is purely my speculation but I believe after finding the car and the bones they knew Steven HAD to have been the murderer but as time continues nothing links Steven having access to the car. They explain to the Halbach family that with what they have found there is no doubt Steven was the killer however not being able to prove Steven had the means to move the vehicle blood DNA had placed him in would raise many questions creating a possibility he would be found not guilty. They ask one of the Halbachs my guess brother in giving them her spare key and explain to him they are merely ensuring justice for Teresa however...if anyone finds out the entire case theyve built is done explains why the brother gets rosey red cheeks and pretends to be so blind when the media asks his opinion of serious evidence the defense later presents. Why was her DNA not on the key? It was the spare key. The rest of what Im going to write has been proven with court documents available online and a sheriffs report dated  Couple weeks after finding the key new evidence begins to reveal itself. However they are fully committed to what theyve built on Steven they now have an outside witness of corruption. A woman who lives  minutes down the road from the Averys was out of town for  weeks after the search for Teresa started was starting to piece together some things her now estranged husband had said to her over the past couple weeks would you be interested in buying a SUV? A comment made after watching a news episode haha stupid Americans...among many others. Coming home and finding a pair of panties with menstration stains that were without a doubt not hers. A lighter fluid can with bloody fingerprints a mason hammer with specks of blood on it and the occasional fresh bones her dogs would bring to the patio. All items accounted for on sheriffs report dated  except for the panties which the investigator said couldnt be Teresas because all of Teresas clothing has been found defense proves later none of her clothes were found. The husband was arrested Nov   and charged with obstructing an officer the officer was the officer who stood the watch on Teresas vehicle night of Nov Nov . He was later released and arrested again in January after breaking an order of protection the wife had filed against him. This causes serious problems for the department because not only do they have evidence that needs to be followed up on giving Teresas family and the community reason to believe there had been another suspect all along but now hes in their custody. The investigation on Avery during this time is at a stand still and things still arent adding up. Thats until they desperately coerce Brendan in March down the path of a false confession. And what do you know the husband is released the day after and all evidence no longer valid because a confession removes any question that they had the right guy all along. After Brendans new attorney found out about this possible evidence in  he asked for the custody records from the county clerk in which the investigator told him there was never any evidence that was mentioned and I have no memory of even speaking with that woman. Well they got rid of all of traces of the evidence except for  copy that has since been recovered after the release of Making a Murderer,MakingaMurderer,cy9v8td,13,t5_3b2cn

Never did it occur to me that he actually would be found guilty. I dont understand how they could start from a place of not guilty  and then slowly work towards  guilty verdict.

To me its the act of a desparate man but I guess it all depends on your perspective.I think his actions before can not br viewed separate from after. If he did it he did a horrible job hiding it with the car and the bones which to me stands in contrast with not slipping up once after the fact during hours of interrogation. Thats the morondexter dichotomy I referred to.I agree that AS would be more likely to get parole but disagree on the last point. Protective instinct  which he hadnt really shown all that much of in part bc he was in prison for  yrs is not necessarily stronger than feelings of honor abd shame for the family name in Pakistani culture. I think for AS that part weighs at least as strong. Also SA kids are grown up and some have kids themselves. He isnt the father figure in their life that most men are.

6066994,0,t1_cyetw1u,Just adding a thought but is it not possible that Avery strangled her then put her in the car and took her to the first burn location to burn her maybe he had been told by other inmates to burn the bodythe best way to erase dna evidence. When putting her into the car she bumped her head and bled a bit. When he arrived at the first location he realized she wasnt dead then he shot her multiple times and tried to burn her.When that didnt work he figured he would get another burn barrel and burn the remainder with a witness Brendan to give himself some sort of alibi.When Jodi called from the jail he knew he had to act normal as his calls were being recorded as he would know from being in jailThen he burned her a second time hoping to get rid of the evidence further. He the drove the car to the lot disconnected the battery leaving blood  in the car and hoped to crush it later but before he did so realized how it would certainly point to him if her car was found crushed later on.Then in bumble idiots  and  Lenk and Colborn. While searching they find a spent bullet along with multiple casings in the junk yard. They find the key close to the car and figuring he is already guilty plant the evidence to ensure conviction.Please dont downvote me you probably will as I am not on either side. There a many avaliable scenarios many cant be proven because Teresas body was burned so we couldnt exactly tell how she died. There could be no blood in the trailer because he strangled her outside her vehicle etc. Just because there is no blood evidence doesnt necessarily mean that there was no murder. It could also mean the police planted the evidence.,MakingaMurderer,cyevgu5,6,t5_3b2cn

6073648,0,t1_cyfqit4,Ill just leave this post hereI went through the page Brendan Dassey March  confession and picked out some of the choicer parts. This is what was played in front of the jury and was used to convict him.    Steven called Brendan to ask his help fixing a car. Brendan went to Stevens garage and saw a dead clothed Halbach in the back of her jeep which had been backed into the garage. She had a stab wound in her stomach and was tied up. She had a blanked over her. Steven told him that he had stripped her and raped her and showed Brendan the knife and rope. There were drips of blood on the garage floor.     Actually he came over to get Brendan. Actually Brendan knew to come over because they had planned the entire episode out a few days in advance. Actually Brendan was riding his bike to get the mail. One piece had Stevens name on it so he started up that way and knocked delivered the mail and left. Actually he went inside and from the living room saw Halbach chained to the bed. He knew she was alive because she was moving around. And screaming for help. Actually on his way there he heard someone screaming help me. Actually he couldnt make out what she was saying. Actually he could make out what she was saying.By the way Brendans brother Bryan was at their garage working on cars but his music was too loud to hear the screams. Anyway a sweaty Steven answers the door and offers Brendan a soda. He mentions to Brendan that he had Halbach in his bedroom Brendan couldnt see her because he had wanted to get some pussy and fuck her so hard. Then he asks Brendan if he wanted to get some pussy. But he said it couldnt happen right then. Actually they went immediately to the bedroom despite Brendans protests that he was under age. A naked Halbach was chained up with regualr silver handcuff and leg cuffs note never does he mention pink fuzzy handcuffs despite the detectives asking over and over again the color of the handcuffs. Halbach asked Steven why he would do something like that but didnt say anything to Brendan. Brendan didnt rape her. Actually he took off all his clothes and did screw her for five minutes. Halbach asked him not to do it and to do the right thing. And to tell Steven to knock it off. And she was crying. Then Brendan put his clothes back on and Steven closed the door they went to the living room and watched TV. Steven said thats how you do it asked if it felt good and said he was going to burn the body. Actually later he said that burning the body was a lastminute decision after Steven put her in the jeep only to reconsider because he didnt think dumping her in the pond by the car pit would dispose of the evidence. Anyway then Steven went back and stabbed her once in the stomach. Then Steven got on top of her and choked her into unconsciousness. Then Steven tied her up.Oh wait in the hallway on the way to the bedroom Steven told Brendan he was going to tie Halbach up stab her then choke her. Anyway Brendan helped tie her up before Steven stabbed her or choked her. She was telling Steven to stop what he was doing but he said he wouldnt. Specifically he told her to shut her mouth and that he was going to kill her. Then they both tie her legs up Otherwise shes going to kick mentions Det. Wiegert helpfully. Then Steven told Halbach he was going to kill her by stabbing her and not letting her go then Steven stabbed her in the stomach. Well sort of in the ribs. With a knife from the kitchen. Then Steven cut off her hair. She was dead at that point. Then Steven punched her. It was unclear to Brendan if she was still dead at this point. Then Steven instructed Brendan to slit her throat which he did.     The throat slitting happened after Steven choked her. As the detectives mentioned he must have gotten a lot of blood on her. Which he then washed off in his bathroom. Actually Brendan slit her throat after Steven choked her. Then Steven shot her. Brendan didnt mention that before because he couldnt think of it. Twice. They did this outside the garage on their way to the fire. Brendan wasnt sure if she was alive prior to the shooting. Then they carry her to the fire. Steven said they had to hurry up because people were coming over for the bombfire. The fire had been going before Brendan got to the house. Actually Steven shot her three times. Actually about  times and it was in the garage. Specifically in her truck. Actually she was on the garage floor. Now we believe you says a detective.Oh and the knife was from the kitchen. Actually it was from the garage. Actually Steven had it in his pocket the whole time.They carried her by hand to the fire.Actually they used a creeper.    It took less than an hour for Halbach to be mostly bones. Steven then chopped up the bones with a shovel put some in a bucket and tossed them off a steep hill in the back of the yard. Randandts pit.    EDIT Forgot that Steven buried most of the bones in a hole he dug  feet away from the fire pit.Brendan went home at  after all this also a bunch of stuff involving moving the truck to the car pit  at some point Steven moves the body from the car pit back to his fire pit with a sled used for fishing and didnt come back.Steven doesnt talk on the phone this whole time.Actually he talks to Jodi at  and then again  minutes later.,MakingaMurderer,cyfqq5y,14,t5_3b2cn

6079401,0,t3_3ytieg,Either SA did it or someone else planted evidence. Theres no two ways about it. Theres no other plausible reason for her key to be in his bedroom or his blood to be in her car. As to whether the police did it or someone else... well. Hypothetically someone else couldve done it. Anyone on his property wouldve had access to his bedroom before the searches and garage wasnt the bullet found like six months after TH was killed? However the circumstances under which these two were found are just a little implausible if you say the police had nothing to do with it.

6085507,0,t1_cyh64ov,Every documentary is biased. Even the mere act of being there to record is selecting a narrative youre going to have to edit your footage at some point and choosing what to include or omit is a subjective call on your part. Even if trying to be as honest as possible at some point your own narrative is going to emerge from the process. So I agree that if you want to hear all relevant information to the case you have to look at transcripts and listen to accounts on the prosecution side as well. That said a major theme in Dasseys interrogation is that the police already know everything their own words not mine. Dassey never really gives them any objective piece of information they didnt already know about or suggest for him to say out loud. Its not as if he told them about the bones in the fire before they found them. Its not like he mentioned anything about guns before they found bullet holes in the victims skull. Its not like he tells them where they could find the license plate to the car or bones in the quarry or the car key in the trailer. If he indeed is actually confessing the police themselves make it impossible to tell because theyre the ones stating everything he admits to for him before he even brings it up. If he were able to demonstrate any inside knowledge of the event by giving them something they hadnt found that would have gone a long way to eliminating reasonable doubt in his case. Instead the police interviewers demonstrated a grasp of conversation skills barely above dasseys himself.

You can drive by peoples yards and see dogs and cats in some of the worst conditions and have been for years.  And these guys have families now and live boring lives.But honestly to me anyway shooting a cat and burning a cat are equally fucked.

You ascribe to me something I never said and claim it is because I made a serious decision based only on demeanor. I did no such thing. I based it on his testimony  the fact he lied in court under oath.They played the recording for him then he denied he said the thing we all heard him say so they played it for him again. Then he made up an excuse on the spot. That alone is enough reason to doubt him. His demeanor is a contributing factor not the sole cause of my doubt he is telling the truth.Why did he not verify the colour or model of the car? Those are the things he would need to know the most during a search for a missing vehicle. He only verified the information that would tell him he had found the right green Rav.In fact in the comment you replied to I said nothing about the brother.

And all Avery has is the cat thing and cousin thing which happened relatively around the same point in his life.But after the false conviction? His behavior changes drastically. He has no offenses in prison and no offenses out of prison.Which paints a picture that he realized his last two violent actions where wrong and learned from them.And now that he is back in prison he still hasnt been violent.So its difficult to assume he would just kill someone for no real reason.

Kachinsky should have moved on this the moment he found out his client was mentally challenged.  If Brendan was enrolled in special ed classes this suggests he iswas learning disabled which also suggests he had an IEP in place at the time of his arrest.  He was a minor at the time and clearly incompetent when it came to responding to the manipulative tactics these officers used to pry a confession out of him.  Allowing his case to proceed without adequate representation for a disabled minor child appears to be gross negligence on behalf of the courts and the defense.

Honestly Steve seems like a guy who doesnt give lots of thought to his words and actions. He seems like he probably makes some really bad decisions fueled by emotions and lack of understanding.

6138430,0,t1_cynbclw,gt roughly  to  hoursI guess I misunderstood your original mention of this. I thought you indicated this was the time frame for the whole murderburningcleanup not for specifically when the body was in the car.Re barrel location I would presume in a scenario like this that someone would be walkingdriving on the road all the way to Averys house a route via which it would be possible to see the barrels behind the Janda house. Heres the map Im going off of gt The idea that someone deliberately murdered Teresa and then had the fortune to stumble around the property and the vehicle too dont forget that there had to be a conveyance from the yard to the quarry and back again... without being seen and with little or no foreknowledge is extremely implausible.Getting nitpicky but deliberately or not we dont know theres no suggestion that she stumbled i.e. werent already aware of the layout of landlot we cant say. Furthermore it is innaccurate to say there had to be a conveyance from the yard to the quarry and back again emphasis minewe dont know that not even remotely yes the car was there at some point and it eventually ended up back on the other side of the lot but it didnt necessarily go to quarry nor necessarily anywhere else in between.gt why expose yourself to an incredible risk to bring it back to the burn pit and dump itHypothetically if someone killed her accidentally on the property it makes total sense that they would use something they found nearby a barrel to moveburn herthings then put it back thinking noone would notice. ,MakingaMurderer,cyndigo,1,t5_3b2cn

6148333,0,t1_cyoep3a,I dont think anyone is suggesting the police murdered her.The insinuation that the body was burned and moved back to the property is pretty well supported by the anthropological evidence suggesting the bones were moved the evidence that some of the remains were at one point also located in a barrel and the presence of human remains pelvic bone that had also been burned at the quarrygravel pit off of the Avery property that still remains completely unexplained in the prosecution narrative unless Avery just randomly placed bones in the barrel and wandered over to the quarry with a piece of burned pelvis and dropped it for no apparent reason. It seems likely someone moved the remains from quarry gt barrel gt burnpit but theres definitely no specific evidence it was the police that did that.While its still possible Steven Avery killed Teresa with a method following some reasonable combination of the prosecutions narrative and the physical evidence it sort of beggars belief that he would say assault this woman in his home kill her in his garage clean both areas put the body in her car drive to the quarry with the body and a barrel burn the body..... and then place all the remains back in the barrel drive back to his own property and dump the remains from the barrel in a firepit behind his own house while leaving the vehicle in his own familys salvage yard.Basically it would mean that he put in a bunch of effort in to do all the things a normal murderer would do  distance himself from the remains attempt to conceal the means of death sanitize the location the crime happened in  and then put additional effort back into incriminating himself after successfully avoiding anything but circumstantial incrimination. You have to assume some level of criminal sophistication in his ability to carefully sanitize his bedroom and the garage of blood but then you simultaneously have to assume that he lost his mind by taking the key to the vehicle he had just hidden on his familys property back to his own bedroom instead of leaving it with the vehicle not collecting the fatal bullet and shell casings when he was bleaching up the garage floor on his hands and knees not cleaning any of the visible fluids he left in Teresas vehicle despite perfectly accomplishing it in the garage and bedroom and having full control of the vehicle for an extended period being perfectly comfortable with having her remains in his own firepit when he could easily have left them in the barrel at a location not directly associated with him and his family..I mean either hes obsessively detailoriented when covering up his crimes or hes not. It should be deeply troubling that your explanation for this is hes both more clever than a forensic technician and way more stupid than your average person. Then on top of those problemsexplanations we add the fact that all of the incriminating physical evidence in Stevens home is found by Manitowoc County Sheriffs Office personnel in high traffic search areas of the home where its implausible something like what they found would get missed and where theres plausible explanations for evidencetampering.,MakingaMurderer,cyoi1tk,4,t5_3b2cn

IMO I think you can really tell throughout the trial and even the comments since the case that the police are completely and thoroughly convinced that SA was the killer. I dont think they were in any way involved with the murder but I think they did plant evidence to convince themselves and the Jury that SA was responsible.I think the lingering question then is what would be the motive for Earl or Charles to murder TH? . Ive heard that the brothers were fighting over ownership of the family business and SA was about to inherit several million dollars. But if anything wouldnt the brothers benefit at least in some way from their brother inheriting several million dollars?. You mentioned that Charles has a violent history with women. Which I suppose you can connect the dots and assume that with his past he could have done it. But aside from being a complete psychopath I cant clearly see a motive for shooting chopping TH up burning her and framing your brother...maybe Im missing something.

Doesnt surprise me a bit that a pro would use diesel. I would too. Not just because Id be less likely to blow myself up...You would need a bit of gas to get it rolling diesel is really hard to ignite cold but once burning it would be the perfect fuel. And it has more stored energy than gasoline... Harder to get burningbut once it does it releases a ton of energy. Thats why jetliners burn kerosene instead of gasoline...

6167995,0,t1_cyqknay,I kinda draw a slight parallel to the case of David Bain As a tldr someone murdered his family and he was arrested and convicted of the crime. He kept denying his guilt and after  or so years his convictions were overturned by the Privy Council the highest court available in New Zealand at the time because they found the defence hadnt been able to put up a strong enough defence. Basically what theyd argued was that it was his dad who had killed them and then killed himself. At his second trial they argued that and he was found not guilty.To me personally it seems like David probably did it. I couldnt say why exactly but it seems like the most likely scenario. But can I say he did it beyond any reasonable doubt? Absolutely not. You can build a pretty strong case that his father did it and the defence in his second trial successfully did so. As Strang I think said elsewhere we dont convict based on maybes. We convict based on beyond all reasonable doubt and thats a pretty high bar to cross and thats a very very good thing.,MakingaMurderer,cyqqjpd,4,t5_3b2cn

Even with the editing it doesnt explain to me to big things that would be necessary to convict him.   no blood in trailer or garage I dont buy that they cleaned it all up  no DNA in trailer or garageAssuming the murder took place somewhere away from the trailer which would explain lack of blood it wouldnt explain the bullet with DNA in the garage. What the doc highlighted for me was the highly suspect evidence. Key  searches?!Bullet flawed test and multiple searches?!SUV cop found it early??? How did he read that licence plate out if they found the plate in another car later???Cops that shouldnt have been onsite were onsite. Assuming Avery did do it all hes pretty stupid if he left evidence laying around. You cant convince me he was smart enough to clean up the blood and DNA but left the SUV hidden and the bones in a burn pit behind his trailer.  The most damning evidence is the blood in the SUV which I think is the best piece if it could be definitively be proven and the DNA under the hood.  Then again no prints?  Ok maybe gloves then why blood?  Ok he wiped it so why not wipe the blood too?  It would appear with luminol but he already bleached his garage.

In isolation it feels like a run of the mill note to forensics.If there were witnesses to a random shooting identifying a suspect if a gun is recovered then you send it to forensics for prints to place the gun in the suspects hand. You also send the suspects jacket to forensics to get gunpowder residue on the sleeve ballistics to link the bullet to the gun etc. The point of spending money on the test is because you think youre going to get something worthwhile out of it. You have good reason to assume a positive test result. The issue is less about colluding to falsify evidence but more that the language the detective uses has no presumption of innocence. In his mind this is the guy and we have to nail him.  That feels like a much wider systemic issue. ,MakingaMurderer,cyv7ln4,4,t5_3b2cn

This would explain it.ALSO  He used his cell phone to call it in instead of using his police radio or the terminal in his car.  Could this be because he was on foot and away from his car?  He could have parked off property and was walking around the back end of the compound.  The backend of the compound where the RAV was found has some back roads that are not part of the Averys property where he could have parked and then walked.

6226956,0,t1_cyxajo2,Ive seen a good bit more than is in the documentary and read the transcripts of the original confession documented at his school. Cant honestly say Ive watched all  hours of this one yet. However from what extra I have seen and read there is still a very strong argument that this confession is false at the least and coerced to a large extent. I say to an extent because I think in addition to coercion being present part of the issue is that Brendan doesnt really seem to understand who these people are why theyre talking to him or what they want from him. It seems like more than anything else he doesnt understand that they want him to tell them exactly what happened and what he knows  essentially that they want the truth. This is shown in the fact that he gives a totally different story when first interrogated in which Steve stabs TH to death in the jeep presumably referring to her RAV  hides the knife under the seat where no weapon is ever found and then burns her at his bonfire. Then of course comes the confession in the doc in which he gives an account that is mutually exclusive to his first and is proven false by multitudes of physical evidence or lack thereof. I suspect that there is some lack of communication there inspired by the detectives telling him to describe whats in his mind possibly construed by him as them asking for some imaginative story and by them telling him that they know the mundane story is false when in reality they obviously dont because Brendan is never tied to the alleged crime any other way. Coercion or lack of communication and understanding aside what really illustrates that these confessions are largely bullshit is the utter lack of proven details that Brendan provides without already being fed them by the officers. They introduce the shooting famously in the doc. They also introduce the idea of a body in the fire and other crucial details. Its not really a confession if the interrogators make up a mostly fictional story sprinkled with facts and then a kid with questionable mental faculties runs with it until hes quickly talking about all sorts of things that are contradicted by physical evidence. Edit Sucks that youve been downvoted.

6245416,0,t1_cyzh5yv,I like your interest.  I finally found somebody serious and interested in the DNA evidence or thing related to it.I do not know if you looked closely to exhibit  in that thread.  If you pay attention that exhibit lists where the items were recovered from e.g. gtthe following items were recovered from a blue Pontiac Grand AM...gtthe following items were recovered from a blue fourdoor Toyota RAVbut for the key and toothbrush it statesgt The following items were also examined in the DNA unit of this laboratoryUnlike the other items it does not state where it was recovered from?  It seems like it was rushed and maybe not properly documented?  It seems to me they decided to analyse the key recovered from a trailer  together with items recovered from the car for some reason.  By that logic they should analyse the toothbrush with items from the toilet.  The toothbrush I actually read somewhere was recovered from the car?  I do not remember where I heardread that?  If the toothbrush is also from the car it is strange that she did an analysis  on an object not actually found in any of the cars.Good find on the timeline I will add it to the post. I never worked in a forensic environment in which case they have to be very specific.  However just because she lists it on a website like that does not mean they do it like that on a daytoday.

I also agree that there are definitely valuable lessons to be learned from this and that there are problems with the justice system. I agree that a lot of Brendans confessions were obviously not true although I do believe he at least helped dispose of the body. I also think its stupid that the state doesnt actually need to prove its timeline. I dont honestly think that they do Im not a legal expert but thats my issue with the prosecution here and it was the same with Adnans case back when Serial was out. If thats youre only point then I dont disagree with you and my argument wasnt for or at you I will say that I think you are not reading the general attitude of this sub correctly. This sub is absolutely dominated by people that think he is innocent and that he was framed that he was set up that so and so was in on it. So and so killed her. Trashing the family of the victim is widely accepted youre downvoted if you even mention him actually being guilty or that he wasnt framed. Since yesterday Ive gotten prolly a couple hundred downvotes Im not being particularly rude to anyone or anything and I think my comments are at least somewhat coherent and thought out. This post has over a hundred comments and its sittin right at . I really dont think its people with your viewpoint this is the only comment really illustrating it. I dont agree with you though that law enforcement fucked this up so bad he should have been found not guilty in just this particular case. I dont think there is any reasonable doubt. Reasonable. I think the defense made a lot of claims I think they made a lot of accusations I do not think any  if at all  stand up to scrutiny and should be taken seriously. The defense can accuse law enforcement of anything they want to but I dont think they showed that law enforcement was actually guilty of anything. The defense is positing that there were all of those things I have yet to see where that was actually true. It scares me to think that you can accuse someone of something and have it be taken as fact. That you can throw speculation out there in an attempt to muddy the waters and get murderer off with nothing substantial to back it up. ,MakingaMurderer,cyzphro,2,t5_3b2cn

6254659,0,t3_418bnn,Why do you assume Jodis interview was paid? I have no idea either way so maybe you know something I dont.Dean Strang and Jerry Buting have done some small podcasts that I seriously doubt can afford to pay guests. Generally you are being paid with exposure or publicity.Jodi is telling her personal story and it contradicts the story she told the filmmakers so she was either lying then or shes lying now and that makes me distrust her regardless of whether shes paid or not. Kratz paid or not is poisoning the pool of public opinion like he poisoned the jury pool.Stevens lawyers have always consistently said that a great injustice was done even if Steven did do it and our justice system has serious flaws. Buting and Strang didnt start doing interviews until after Kratz did and I think their motive was not to let him get away with it. Ive frankly been wondering how they could afford to do interviews instead of working billable hours. Maybe they are getting paid. But Butings website talks about him doing public speaking on DNA evidence problems and similar stuff.In other words Jodi is contradicting herself while Buting and Strang are continuing to champion values thayve always championed.

Clear that up for me first before you carry on with the hard evidence bitMaking a Murderer also shows that the vial was supposed to be in a sealed box. But when the prosecution discovered it the seal had been broken. Manitowoc County DA E. James Fitzgerald said that he opened the box after both sides were given permission to study the evidence from Averys previous trial.source  Im simply citing an article so I dont know if prosecution should read defensegtDNA...little spot under the hood? That wasnt put there by Avery...it came off a rubber glove by an investigator. One spot...one little spot and still no hair...no fiber? Boy I hope you never get accused of something serious and find yourself in a courtroom defending yourself against this kind of Hard Evidence. LOLDNA. The DNA in the blood in the front of the jeep. The DNA on the key. The DNA on the hood. Her DNA on the bullet. Her DNA on the bones in his yard. This is what we call hard evidence.

If you ever see a story where a burned body is found outside my house and I was the last person to see the victim alive and they find my blood in the victims car and the victims DNA on a bullet in my garage the bullet coming from the same kind of gun that I own then I am either guilty of murder or being elaborately framed by the police.

6269138,0,t3_41e9xv,I believed they were innocent until I read hundreds of pages ofwatched hours of Brendan Dasseys interrogations. The full interrogations were much more telling than the parts included on netflix. One of the details that made me change my mind is when Brandan said SA moved some of the bones to the rock quarry. He described the location and was not fed that answer at least not that I know of as it didnt come up as a topic on previous interrogations. I dont see how he would have known that otherwise. Aside from that seeing his story develop over each interview and evolve made it hard for me to believe he wasnt involved. He was coaxed on some occasions but on others he talked without too much coaxing. From the very first interrogation at his school he said he felt threaten by Avery and feared retribution if SA was releasedclearly he used different wording lol. That plus the fact his mom said he did help Steven clean his garage around that time and bleach stains were found on his pantswhich he told police that it came from cleaning the blood in the garage. One thing he obviously knew from the beginning was the location of where the car was hidden and the fact it was covered with a car hood and branches. However I feel like he could have found out those details when the car was found. Also the way Brendan described in some interrogations that they placed THs body in the car first because they were originally going to throw her in the pond or crush the car with her in it then they decided to burn her instead seems like a thought process Brendan wouldnt just imagine on his own. It also happens that the car was hidden near where the car crusher was located which matches up with Brendan saying that SA was planning to crush it.In the very first version of the story he said she was put in the back of her car the details surrounding that changed in later stories however it seemed like he knew from the beginning that her body had been in the back of that car which fits with the forensics. He was forward with those details in the school interview in february before the march interview. He also mentioned in that interview he was afraid of talking because he didnt want the police to think he had something to do with it which makes me think that despite his low capacity he understood enough that it may be better for him to withhold information which accounts for the continually changing story. I think he kept telling his mom nothing happened not because he had an easier time being honest with his mom but because he didnt want to admit it to her. I think his docileness and low mental capacity are not just signs that he could be easily coerced into saying things but also a sign Steven could easily coerce him into helping.The other thing is the written death threat Steven wrote his exwife Lori while he was in prison the first time for the crime he was exonerated from. That and the incident where he ran his cousin off the road as well as dosing that cat in gasoline and throwing it in the fire and signs to me that Steven definitely had the capacity to commit a crime like this. In fact the cat incident may have been inspiration to burn Theresa.    There are other reasons that caused me to change my mind but that sums it up. I highly recommend reading and watching the full BD interrogation transcripts. Seeing which info he was fed and which info he wasnt fed and seeing how the story evolved made me believe he was telling the truth about at least some of it.Despite this I still think there is plenty of room for reasonable doubt.edit Also I think Steven Avery is a classic case of Munchausen Syndrome. I think he enjoyed the sympathy and attention he received from the first case. BD said he did it out of anger but also because he wanted to go back to jail. I think its true and I think not only did he want to go back to jail but also go back to jail while maintaining his innocence. I think he enjoys playing the role of victim.,MakingaMurderer,cz28bte,18,t5_3b2cn

6305220,0,t3_41yobr,Whats more is why didnt the defense show all the interviews so the jury would hear the inconsistencies? This is a kid who has never been in any trouble even at school and who while freely confessing to a heinous murder couldnt consistently remember where he murdered how he murdered and what weapon he used when he murdered.The damage was done with the jury hearing one confession. Theres no damage to be done in them hearing more. The only thing that could come out of doing that was a benefit. The jury would have heard the many statements whereas the only things Brendan said the same in each one were   what Steven Avery was wearing. Shoot. I know what SA was wearing because Brendan Dassey told me SA was wearing red shorts and a white shirt in every statement he gave. But IDK what Teresa Halbach was wearing because BD cant consistently tell me that. How does he remember what SA was wearing and not remember the clothes of the person who would be the most notable in his mind?  his I watched TV I played video pages I yapped on the phone and then I went to Steven AverysI dont understand why the defense attorneys wouldnt show the jury what they saw after watching all of them. Shoot the cops didnt believe Brendan Dassey was consistent in his story of the killing across all of his confessions hence BD asking his mom what inconsistent means. IMO BD was much more damaged with the jury only hearing one socalled confession. He would have been much better off with the jury reading the transcript from the high school the statement in late Feb the March st statement and the May statement. I know that sounds risky but there was no way the damage from the March st confession was going to be abated. But IMO if they heard all of them and all the inconsistencies within the jury would be much more openminded to the defense expert and the psych exam that both spoke of how suggestible he was. They would also have seen how in each confession he tried to assert the truth and how the cops and the defense investigator just wont have that. I think not doing that was a huge error on the defense side. Now if they didnt do it because the judge wont allow it if there is any ode to pragmatism left within the system that should be something that rises to harmful error by the court.When I heard just the March one I thought yeah the cops led him but what he said was both very incriminating and very likely to be true. However after I listened to them all? Thats when I was convinced they were false. Ive also talked to a lot of people who had the same experience I did. I havent talked to one person who after watchinghearingreading all pf them believes he is guilty. OTOH I have talked to quite a few people who only watched the March st and who believe he is guilty.,MakingaMurderer,cz6bzno,9,t5_3b2cn

Steve didnt make them look bad.  The retired sheriff and the retired DA made them look bad.  Steve was just the unwitting victim.  In your extensive research have you ever come across any actual evidence that this agency was out to get him?  I mean excluding MaM?RE assault prosecutions.  These dont get prosecuted when the victim backs off and says they wont testify.  No case to prosecute.Re the yo.  At age  or  whatever at the time the girl resisted her mother and didnt want to go after Steve.  Allegedly he had told the girl if she tells anyone her family dies.  Later at  she said yes it did happen.  She didnt want to become another new focus for the media frenzy surrounding Steve.  So the DA made the decision that theyd keep her out of that spotlight and keep things on hold pending the trial resolution on Halbach.  Additionally Jodi has said that Steve told her he had sex with the girl.  Very few details in my research on the yo also complaining of a sexual assault and saying Steve told her she would die if she came forward.By the way this is in a separate county Brown if memory serves.

6311208,0,t3_420paf,I thought this was interesting as well.... Wiegert and Fassbender were supposedly using the Reid technique in Brendans interrogations.This bit from the developertrainer of this commonly used technique are from his websiteEvery interrogator must exercise extreme caution and care when interviewing or interrogating a juvenile or a person who is mentally or psychologically impaired. Certainly these individuals can and do commit very serious crimes but since many false confession cases involve juveniles andor individuals with some significant mental or psychological disabilities extreme care must be exercised when questioning these individuals and the investigator has to modify their approach with these individuals. Furthermore when a juvenile or person who is mentally or psychologically impaired confesses the investigator should exercise extreme diligence in establishing the accuracy of such a statement through subsequent corroboration. In these situations it is imperative that the interrogator does not reveal details of the crime so that they can use the disclosure of such information by the suspect as verification of the confessions authenticity.Source Id been on the Reid site before and saw a short blurb on false confessions with a bulleted list of those who might give a false confession. Brendan met at least  of the criteria but I cant remember what page of the site it was. But wait theres more. Heres info on false confessions emphasizing that juveniles and mentally impaired individuals make up a good portion.

Colburn was in his own car or for some reason did not want to use the radio in the patrol car...I think he found the car on the rd sent the person who took them to the burnsite where the car was away told them the cops would take it from there. They already knew TH was last seen at Averys now they have her carburned body etc...the informant goes off thinking the cops had it..the next thing informant hears is the carbody was found at Averys informant leaves town. theory Then Colburn calls Lenk and they commence their plan to frame Avery. On the th Id bet ANYthing that Colburn had already been in contact with RyanMike..he may have even given them the idea to check the VMs...he may have even given them the idea to delete anything from Steven supposing there was...because the dirty bastard musta done something to her..and they had to make him pay...which is why RyanMike were so easily guided to send Pam on the th..to magically discover the car led by godgt aka ColburnLenk. The stupid PI because shes a private investigator who doesnt know where VIN numbers are..cough cough walked right to it...because... Colburn told them they had a tip the car had been seen in the lot and the cops told them exactly where to look which is why stupid Pam found it on a  acre lot in ten minutes. Overhelping then having to lie about it when the shit his the fan. Colburn and Lenk took HUGE advantage of the burn the witch mentality of people eager to help.Earl gave permission to search without a warrant so he must not have known the car was back there. Because if he were involved he would have no way of knowing theyd blame Steve and not him...even if HE was the one who did it and set it all up...he could not be certain Steve would take the blame. So I dont see Earl as a viable perp...unless there is information re Earl like bloody clothes etc that someone is keeping secret. Which isnt impossible but its not probable.

In what world does SA have the brain and the means to wipe the DNA and then leave the key in his room? The same world where he hides the RAV with his and THs blood with  twigs and an old sign instead of crushing it? Nice world you live in but its not reality.Maybe I misunderstood your point then since I thought I addressed exactly that. No reporters in the documentary interviewed him in his trailer AFAIR. Feel free to prove me wrong. It was dark by the time he would have hidden the car not that easy to spot any blood. And who knows what his plan was? People like to bring up crushing the car. That would have been pointless and not that easy to do without anyone noticing. The car would have still been found and on the Avery property for sure. And by crushing it it would only mean that theres just only  suspects him and his  brothers. By keeping the key he still had the possibility to drive it out of the property. I suppose the key had blood in it and he would have to wash it. You can get DNA of with just plain water no big deal. gtAre you now making the claim that no furniture was moved in the first . hour search by  officers? And  people missed the key. ONE person didnt. Not strange? Once again nice fantasy world youre living in but its not reality. Sorry!Why in the world would they start by moving around furniture when theres literally hundreds of objects visible that they have go through? They key wasnt one of them. gtI wouldnt like you to say anything. But you said Lenk. Interesting.You literally asked me for a name. gtAnd Im not sure why you are bringing up a civil suit? The person who found the key worked for the same PD. You know the one that they said should abstain from participating in the case due to the previous  year wrongful conviction and imprisonment?Because the civil suit seems to be the motive for the planting the people believing in the conspiracy bring up.

6347259,0,t1_czaweqp,You appear deliberately patronising in not acknowledging a difference between experts conducting original scientific research and experts validating scientific methods like chef vs inspector. Lebeau is an established researcher and FBI man that is clear he had never tested for EDTA before but seemed to have links to the FBI lab that falsely found EDTA in a sock in the OJ Simpson trial and himself claimed scientific certainty for a politicallyrushed chemical detection protocol in another trial that led to a conviction that turned out to be wrong.Your comments about Arvizus testimony on the two ion modes are so prejudiced I wonder if this is a rational discussion. She was initially clarifying what the prosecutor was actually asking about then she says the negative ion aspect was not displayed that day but she did review it  but according to the FBIs own protocol if the positive ion side shows a nondetection then the negative ion side is irrelevant as its an overall failed detection you cant cherrypick bits of tests against protocol decisions when it suits thats classic as Im sure you know but do yourself above. You mispresent Arvizu about method detection limit  she clearly states the rushed FBI did not do the proper tests or provide the proper data to establish the method detection limit as defined scientifically rather than in lay terms. Now finally to what actually matters hereYou admit that the test they developed cannot rule out the presence of EDTA at low levels. Totally contrary to the FBI mans claimed scientific certainty.In fact from pg of day  Lebeaus own ad hoc test on oldish EDTAblood samples failed to detect EDTA nearly half the time.Yet you are certain it would detect. Even though the defense pointed out Averys tube was five times older may not have been shaken before tampered with and the FBIs lower level detections were achieved by feeding blood straight into the testing apparatus rather than extracted from swabs of stains.,MakingaMurderer,czb42gx,3,t5_3b2cn

The question then becomes what was TH down my between  and . When she spoke to the office around  she said she was almost to averys and the true time from last stop to averys was about  minutes. All other stops lasted about  minutes so if she went right there and it was a usual stop she should have been gone before bus arrived. I think Bobby and or Scott were messing with the guns and shot her accidentally. Them or the brother Earl who remained in the background for the entire  years or so it seems and who allegedly hid when they came to swab family for dna comparisons. He was sighting his guns that day and the cadaver dogs hid on the gold cart he was driving the day of as well. Point is too much reasonable doubt. There is no such thing as sweat dna and the officer who opened the hood testified that he did not change his gloves after handling SA items up until he popped hood. I have learned that dna is not the magic bullet.  In low quantities as it was here its very tricky. This young lady was not killed in sas house or garage.

6356691,0,t1_czbz5qo,Okay I see where youre coming from and I agree with some of what youre saying.  Certainly s and dumb isnt an excuse.  Personally Im not even sure hes dumb.  IQ scores are what they are.  Given his drunken hillbilly family a business he knows hell always have a job at and  acres to fuck around in as a kid I can see him scoring a much lower on IQ tests than a normal or strict upbringing would have got him.  I actually had friends growing up that were very quick but played up the dumb angle in school for an easy ride.  Different strokes.Anyway where we definitely disagree is how you can be sure why he changed his story. First of all Im not even sure the investigators know when the bonfire was.  Has this been proven somehow?  Forensically or by eyewitness?  And I mean a decent eyewitness not another hungover or dim Avery saying the first thing that comes to mind.  If he is a complete psychopath and did cook her whats to stop the bonfire from happening a day or two after abducting her?  He had plenty of time.  The family also had plenty of time to get their story straight if one of them admitted to the cops there was a bonfire on halloween even thought there wasnt.  A tight knit group of dumb people may go with the flow when concocting a story because you think its the easiest way out.  Admit to one thing and you wont be guilty of another.  Again I was guilty of this myself as a child among friends trying to get away with something we did at recess.  All people can be dumb. All people can lie.Having said all that Im certainly not sure what combination of the above happened.  He told the truth at first lied subsequently.  He lied at first and told the truth afterwards.

6360554,0,t3_42r58i,It is intriguing but must discount the bus driver and profane truck drivers testimonies about seeing TH at Averys ..Note also that in the middle of Mrs. Zipperers testimony there is a longer deliberation without the Jurors as Kratz wont allow Strang to touch more on the Nov.  evening call from Dedering to Mr. Zipperer Strang cites info that Zipperer have stated that he will have dogs eat trespassers and that Halbach should be arrested for trespassing. Kratz argument is that Mrs. Zipperer did not take the call and would only offer hearsay. Interesting btw is that she denies knowing of where the Avery Salvage yard is. Some has elsewhere stated that this is not at all odd in rural areas.Strang accepts to not ask further and asks if Dedering is going to be called indicating he will then ask him about the phone call. Kratz says he is outside the door and will be next wittness if this line of arguments continues. Strang steps down and Kratz does his routine on redirect with getting Mrs. Zipperer to say TS was there between  and .. She is not sure though when Strang goes at her again but she ultimately goes with her old testimony provided by Kratz when Kratz has the final word.Dedering is not next witness and I guess he never testifies? If so it is a bit peculiar that the defense does not call him as an example of a hostile and suspicious person not being investigated. Perhaps they realize that Zipperer indeed is just a certifiable nutcase?But I admit that the Zipperer theory is interesting but challenging. SA must really mess up time when he states to the news when Theresa was at his place. Or was he still mentally on DST? And we have to discard the bus driver and propane truck drivers testimony but the former is not sure about the day and the latter does not see that much. Hmmm in any case it would be interesting to see some more info on the Zipperers. Surely Remiker and Wiegert know that Zipperer will be furious of a visit. But in my ears their humorous mention of Zipperer morely seem to indicate that they do not take him seriously.This could of course still make him a candidate suspect for a random act of violence.....,MakingaMurderer,czcmh90,4,t5_3b2cn
6361631,0,t1_czcjhkc,I really like your scenario... it also helps keep the police evidence tampering to potentially just two officers Colborn and Lenk. Assuming the Zipperes were involved in THs death this leaves a huge loose end that could potentially byte the the prosecutions case in the butt. I think Colborn and Lenk must really believe or at least have convinced themselves that SA killed TH or they would be living in constant worry that someone may come forward with new information or even a guilty conscience confession. ,MakingaMurderer,czcqw61,3,t5_3b2cn

The point of this documentary should not be shifting public perceptions. It should be discussing whether or not Avery killed Halbalch. The documentary fails to address this and treats the family of Halbalch with minimal sympathy.

How does EDTA in blood versus coagulated blood look different under microscope? As a physician Im sure you know that most smears are prepared with EDTA blood.

If the blood stains had contained free acid but no FeEDTA and they called those negative can you imagine the reaction from people? EDTA can dissociate from metal ions which is why they also looked for the free acid form also because EDTA is in excess to the molar ratio expected to complex with all metal ions.I dont think well ever know what volumes made it onto the swab how do you get a volume from a dried spot? but I understand that its best practice to absorb as much of the stain as possible with a swab and the drops that caused the Rav stains had to be at least uL so I would bet at least a crisp fiver that they got far more than  uL.Id have to go back and reread the procedure but I think they tested everything in triplicate.

6394731,0,t1_czfzr4l,im probably at the stage of agreeing with you for the most part about the Averys. The run in with the law is not some free spiritsquare peg in a round hole kind of deal.A number of the averys in particular steven and his brothers have some serious issues. I think in the mental health field it would be fair to say that a family member is to blame for their issues whether it be fathermother or some uncle or aunt perhaps close family friend maybe combo of all of this.However! They shouldnt be persecuted by an entire community in particular the police. And it should never in a million years lead to such persecution to wrongful life imprisonment.And the case of Brendan is just ridiculous.I agree the averys are a dodgy ass family with serious mental health issues and the locals have good reason to view them with caution.

Youre correct about the chain of custody. However why even keep the blood? They already had Averys DNA profile in the system. The blood vial itself was never an exhibit in any trial or postconviction proceedings so I dont understand why it was kept in a  court case file at the County Clerks Office. According to testimony by the Clerks Office staff the file was left out in plain view. Also journalists and the public allegedly had unfettered access to it. The County was negligent.

6441648,0,t1_czld4u3,If there is none its because the investigation was botched from the get go. You have to admit that the documentary yes its not a movie has raised questions on how the incriminating pieces of evidence were found  usually in the presence of Manitowoc sheriffsinvestigators who were not supposed to be involved due to the lawsuit. What items they did find are questionable  flattened lead bullet which shows it was fired from a . caliber rifle common in that area. They did not show that it came from his rifle specifically. The supposed DNA evidence for that was tested in a shoddy manner by this woman who contaminated it with her own DNA while she was demonstrating to new staff. She also had everything out on her table as opposed to making sure things were in a sterile environment to prevent crosscontamination.The fact that not a single piece of uncontaminated DNA evidence places her inside his garage or trailer already raises questions.And dont you find it interesting how the Judge referred to his crimes as increasing in severity as if he no longer remembers that it was a wrongful conviction.In his  wrongful conviction it was said by the investigators that no actual investigation was made. They had a rape kit that wasnt tested properly. They had another officer telling them they had the wrong guy. Nothing was done. Only after the investigation started did Sgt Colburn write a police report about the officer reporting a link to Gregory Allen.

A piece of evidence that isnt very important considering they have THE CAR on his property? A piece of evidence that isnt necessary.That is more likely than her just grabbing her spare key in a hurry that morning? Let me break down what were talking about here. Im not talking about if this implicates Steven or not. People tie too many things together when trying to analyze this that shouldnt be.We are talking about the likelihood she used her spare key that day. Whether its more likely she grabbed her spare key in a hurry or if there is a conspiracy committed by multiple people to ensure that key gets placed in Steven Averys possession.None of this matters anyway though. The lanyard was found in the Rav so they didnt get a key from her apartment later. She had to have had that key that day. Unless the conspirators were lucky enough that she just brought the lanyard portion of her valet key that day by circumstance but left the actual key in her apartment for them to find later. Yes thats sarcasmIf we are talking about the key being planted which is possible its more likely that she used that key that day and that key was taken from the vehicle and planted in Stevens home than the killer hiding the keys and they got the key from somewhere else.,MakingaMurderer,czmgkca,2,t5_3b2cn

6468530,0,t1_czodg5o,Yes totally possible but I think they mentioned it wasnt found with the burned electronics. Im thinking this could explain why there was a delay in reporting her missing. The perp RH possibly panicked and took a day or two to review her voice mails to figure out her schedule and then once he realized Avery was on her schedule he seized the oppotunity to plant stuff. Because really he seems to have been someone who saw her oftenI base this on the fact that the roommate called him to ask if he knew where she was.

6482889,0,t1_czptfuj,Yup but there is also no chance that she would ever be coming back. They can grieve and move on. The averys are stuck wishing for something that will never happen. The averys did not spend any more time with Stephen as their son than the halbach did with theresa. The halbachs also never had their child and their name dragged through the mud and completely vilified on national television every night for months. things may be a little different now but nowhere near the same scale. They got to go to court and see the person they knew was responsible for taking their child away convicted and locked away. The averys dont get that pleasure. The averys lost their child as well as grandson in the same incident and Brendans conviction is honestly just as unfair and sensless.Nobody is saying the halbachs have it easy here. Everyone feels for them even Stephen Brendon and all of the averys  and I am sure dont get the same compasion. It sucks people are murdered constantly for no reason at all and there isnt anything you can do but try and live your life. As hard as that is it is much harder for the averys. There is NOTHING that could have destroyed the avery family as completely as this.And of course Teresas cousinsibling Mike obviously loved his newfound fame and time in front of the camera. The rest of the family went to court but kept to themselves like you would expect. Mike took every chance he could to get in front of the camera with a shit eating grin on his face and publicly criticize and shame two people he knew nothing about one of which even he should have known was innocent. Claiming the confession speaks for itself I dont even know why we are even having a trial...today yet no I hadnt seen it the confession I feel real and deep sympathy for her mother and sisters I really do but mike I dont respect him now do I feel bad for him. And the averys it is a totally different situation and to try to compare them is pointless  like I tried to above but to claim or suggest that we should feel any less or no sympathy for the averys because of Teresas family thats the reasoning of a very close minded and very stupid person.,MakingaMurderer,czpvnlk,5,t5_3b2cn

If you spend  years living a small room with almost no choice in anything and you go out into the world and there are tons of choices for everything it has to be pretty disconcerting.  And Ryan was a pretty intelligent guy and had very strong family support.  Inmates get very little for the most part in transitioning back into real life.

But ofcourse if it turns out hes innocent because they find the real killers or something things just might go faster.But the real staying power of this series is the fact that it gives you such a great window into the judicial process of an accused its social reality and this with the backdrop of a captivating story. There are so many seperate issues in this documentary that highlight problems.. This is about journalism about representation during interrogations about false confessions about science and the courtroom police and judicial accountability social classes ethics appearances stereotypes ...On so many different issues it gives a unique and engaging look that allows people to learn alot about the system that they otherwise wouldnt necessarily learn because they havent studied or practiced law for example. I can guarantuee you that there will be people that will be motivated by this documentary to go into law and provide more counterbalance for idiots like Kratz.In classrooms with todays students they can learn more and be much more involved from an entire semester of watching and discussing this series than they ever would from me just lecturing to them about the criminal justice system for the same amount of time. As far as educational matierial goes this is pure gold if you ask me regardless of whether Avery actually did it or not which is why I think this will have such staying power. It is making issues important for youth growing up that werent before and its that very youth that will shape our society of tomorrow. Not sure if this will create a new genre of documentary filmmaking or will inspire copies but you will really need to bust your butt if you want to get the kind of reach this one did. It is so meticulously thought out was such a coming together of so many threads like a perfect storm that it wont be easy to produce something that will be received quite like this one.,MakingaMurderer,czsmv0m,5,t5_3b2cn

The idea is that Kusche helped frame Avery to keep the attention away from Allen and more importantly away from his son.

6524331,0,t1_czt5oxj,gtThe documentary took that innuendo filled it in with emotional pleas and dramatic music and I think did a tremendous disservice to justice the police the prosecutor and the jury who watched the whole trial. Most of all Teresa and her family.    Thank you for voicing so well my own conclusion about MaM after I stepped back from the doc read and analyzed more.    Its a very polarizing conclusion of course because the prevailing sentiment is that MaM has undoubtedly had a net positive impact in terms of the good it is doing.   I cant agree.   While Id credit the program with rightfully pointing up some notable problematic systemic things e.g. Kratzs press conference or Len Kachinskys seeming to buddy with investigators rather than heed the wishes of his client ... In terms of relating the evidence of the Avery trial  MaMs central area of interest and its big programming hook  in an honest and balanced way?   It was a big and to some extent deliberate fail.   Explaining the sometimes deliberate failings of MaM was usuperpickle in his lengthy but quite substantive comment here which concludes I think in totality the transcripts have given a much clearer view of the case and show how intentionally deceitful the doc was.  I completely agree and its why I view MaM as having been harmful both to the Halbachs and more generally to the average persons honest understanding of the Avery evidence.,MakingaMurderer,czu61ri,3,t5_3b2cn

No one knows what happened during the night.The BBQ isnt a good example because theres stuff leftover from the cooking process.  Youre not incinerating the meat.  If the fire was hot enough for long enough to incinerate all of the flesh then there might not be anything left to smell.  Plus it might be the case that the burning tires and the burning car seat masked the smell of the body.

6546652,0,t1_czwgmcu,Based on information they had in front of them at the time. Dont forget a lot of what you know now maybe even the majority of it was NOT known by the jury. We got to see evidence that was not admissible. We got to hear from people never called to the stand to testify. We have information beyond the trial that wouldnt come out for years like Kratzs scandals that a lot of people filter his trustworthiness through. We have a lot of information they did not have. And in some ways being able to read body language of people testifying rather than just read transcripts they had impressions that we do not have. We are not operating off the same set of information so we cant judge their decisions based off our knowledge unless we can honestly wipe ourselves down to what they knew and only what they knew and see if it still makes sense or not. But we cant. You can say the judge should know the law better and should let this thing in or keep that thing out. You can say the lawyers should have seen enough coerced confessions to spot one and tear it apart. You can fault a lot of people in this but why a jury of lay people not familiar with the idea of false confessions hell it still seems to shock most people now that such a thing is possible or as common as it is who didnt have all the same pieces of information that we do? ,MakingaMurderer,czwh6qd,1,t5_3b2cn

When I get into conversations about this case IRL it is very hard for me to reconcile the in depth frame job that would have had to occur. The things that make me think he could be innocent are definitely the lack of blood anywhere and the key. It makes me think If they could plant that evidence how far would they go?Im not familiar enough with who exactly was being sued but if it was MCPD and a higher up decided to frame SA then somebody would have had to do the dirty work. May make sense that it was two of the officers who were being deposed and got them into the mess in the first place.That being said I have no idea.

The bullet was determined to have been fired from a . but Steven wasnt the only one on the property who owned one. The bullet doesnt connect him to the crime directly.. In any scenario that supports the blood planting theory it makes more sense with the assumption that if planting happened then it happened before the car was found publicly..

6607447,0,t3_465zon,The rule on witnessessequestration rules vary by state so I can only comfortably discuss the sequestration rule as it applies to the state that I practice in...in any event here goes Mike Halbach. In my state the victim or victims representative i.e. a family member of Teresas must be sequestered until they testify. After their testimony theyre free to remain in the courtroom for the remainder of the proceedings. For this reason the prosecution will generally have the victimvictims representative testify early on in the trial. However I dont know if Wisconsin follows the same procedure. I do know that some states exclude victims andor their representative from sequestration as a whole and some states allow victims to request that they testify early so they can be present during the remainder of  the proceedings and once that request is made the state must honor it.  Weigert and Fassbender. There is a federal rule that most if not all states follow that says the sequestration rule does not apply to an officer or employee of a party that is not a natural person after being designated as the partys representative by its attorney. Namely a law enforcement officerinvestigative agent is permitted to remain in the court room at the counsel table at all times despite being a witness because they are considered a designated representative of the State who can assist the prosecutor at trial. This applies to civil trials as well as criminal trials and would apply the same way if the government was the defendant. For example if youre in a car accident with a city bus and decide to take the matter to court the attorney for the city would most likely have a designated representative not the bus driver themselves but probably the transportation director at the trial table with them to assist. I hope this was somewhat helpful for you and am happy to answer any other questions you may have to the best of my ability Here is a website that explains the federal rule on sequestration ,MakingaMurderer,d02rkqt,7,t5_3b2cn

Also how in the concrete cracks where they cleaned...not a shred of Teresas DNA...but his DNA was present. in the cracks...if bleached those cracks should have nothing there.logic test . which is more likely..that someone killed her burned her body offsite then used a burn barrel to transport her bones to his pit and dumped the bones leaving some bones in the barrel with the ash to frame him..or..that he and brendan killed her put her in the Rav drove her car to hide it then drug her body back to the burn pit through the salvage yard then burned her in the pit and tossed some bones in the burn barrel for good measure?logic test  would you or anyone you know blow  million dollars even though it would be less..just to kill a girl and dispose of her body and risk all that?logic test  would a man who served  years in prison for a crime he didnt commit and blamed the cops...actually allow the cops to look around without a warrant if he had this slaughterhouse in his trailer and garage and her car hidden on his property? Colborn found nothing out of the ordinary in the garage or trailer.Now for a logical explanation. With her disappearance sheriffs found her car on Nov. rd Colborns call planted it then Pam Sturm and Jesus found it. With Averys blood planted in it. There we go there is their case. Something nefarious happened. Must have been Avery cause of that evidence. He gets a public defender but...as a total surprise to the sheriffs...he settles his lawsuit and hires two top attorneys in the state. Well now the sheriffs are spooked...so they interrogate Blaine and Jodi but they are not having any part of helping. Brendan though..poor Brendan is challenged enough to let them guide him on their narrative of evidence they plan to find soon after...and voila. They found it...more damning evidence against Avery.Then Averys assumption of innocent until proven guilty is just absolutely destroyed by Kratz  minute press conference.

Stakers partially clothed body was found on the floor of the childrens bedroom.Would her childrens bedroom not be the very first place she would run to after suspecting that someone broke in especially if she called out to the babysitter and got no answer?

6638995,0,t3_46kyyo,Dean Strang brought this up in one of the interviews The example was brought up that even someone like Bill Cosby who is a top . can be outclassed in a trial setting as far as money spent. Not only is a lot of money spent but general the federal government offers free services for them which can be invaluable as we saw in Averys case.Now I understand why people may see no issue with this because you need all the information you can get but I think there is a lack of understanding of the repercussions with it being this way. I would totally agree that you spend whatever it takes to find the truth but the prosecution is not looking for the unbiased truth really. They are supposed to try to prosecute this person to the best of their ability. The defense is supposed to defend to the best of theirs and theoretically this will end with justice done. In the Memphis  trials a public defender was given like  for their pay and any expenses total I may remember that wrong but it was ridiculously low. If both sides are trying to find the truth it would be a different story. However these seem to effectively play out as  sides enter  side leaves. Fight it out to the best you can.

I am constantly getting ripped on for writing too much here too lol. Like how can you possibly communicate anything meaningful in  sentence?They are highly opposed to reading.  I find it interesting people will ask a question about something rather involved then protest if the answer is too long. I say well for example if you want to understand DNA profiling you are going to have to read a lot more than a paragraph... I went to school for more than a decade...PI think a lot of people will not read an article explain some aspect about the case but they will read a tweet and spend time discussing it.And scientists are now saying that the brains of all the kids growing up in this culture are developing differently so people literally do have shorter attention spans! Then we diagnose them all with ADHD!Thanks for the info I was wondering about that. It will be interesting to see what happens.

For now we can let off the whole it was planted speculation and focus on the integrity of your argument presented. Had a bullet struck something with enough force to flatten the lead there should be evidence of whatever it struck. I cant tell from the photos if it was a hollowpoint bullet or not but as ballistics testing can show the lr is more than capable of retaining velocity had it been simply a grazing shot. Penetration into the ballistics gel in the above link show that the round is not at all like a BB gun round where it would hit a target and bounce around like a frozen pea. For comparison BB rounds used to calibrate the ballistic gelatin for firearm testing is usually showing about  to  inches of penetration more on calibration here Especially if that round was not a HP we would not see compression of the round UNLESS it struck something with tremendous relative force which we would absolutely have seen evidence of. Again I dont know if it has been established whether or not it was a HP round or not.If you dont mind my questioning of your evidence What sort of garage walls only ding from bullets? What are the walls made of in your garage? Were you present when the rounds were fired so you know that all come from the same source a firearm? What was the caliber? What were the reasons for him discharging a firearm in a garage towards walls? Im not being snarky but these would be my simple starting followup questions to that information. before considering it as allowable in the argument.these are direct shots but we can see the impact a lr round can have in concrete  minute mark.  This would have been expected to have happened to the cement floor at close range had it grazed her to the point of no blood but DNA. I think had it come in contact with her actual skull bone there would be blood evidence on the bullet. It would make sense that a bullet which penetrated skin and nerve then came in contact with her skull and exited the tissue would have some trace amounts of blood on it. Thats what the OP is about anyways.The physics of where the bullet ended are what seem to tell a different story here to me. If it hit her skull thered be evidence of that on the bullet. I cant say the evidence would exist on the skull found because to my knowledge it was more like fragments rather than every piece to an entire skull found so that may not be present if your scenario was the case. Simple ballistics testing shows that if it had hit the floor with enough velocity to stop the majority of its momentum the bullet would have compressed more. they searched that garage up and down more than once if I remember correctly documented every item and nothing pointed in the direction of a bullet hitting anything in that garage so far as I am aware. A forensic team should be expected to find such evidence and certainly search for it once a discharged bullet is found. It simply was not present as far as the information Ive gathered and seen shows. To prove a lr was actually fired in the garage would have been damning evidence and yet no such evidence actually exists.  ,MakingaMurderer,d0c3enw,1,t5_3b2cn

6760478,0,t1_d0ig8up,Dna evidence is fantastic it truly is unique and has exonerated many and rightly convicted others.  The problems we see here are down to human failings in bias or mistakes that we are all susceptible to.  Or down to experts overreaching or downright lying about the claims they can possibly make.  Or down to pure and simple corruption.  When it comes to bullet ballistics I know little but what I have read suggests it is very questionable and certainly in the Avery case absolutely incorrect.  fingerprints unfortunately are not what we think they are not actually unique nearly but not completely.  Weirdly I studied at Southampton University which I think one of the article mentions and they were the leaders in fingerprint research at the time.  Fingerprint reading is a highly developed skill and mistakes can be made particularly if bias is involved.  Even if a match is brought up on a computer a human has to verify it.   Eye witness testimony is seriously not to be relied upon on its own.  False confessions happen ALL THE TIME.  So whilst these types of evidence are very important and can play a part in a trial they are not foolproof.in the Avery trial nothing matches up nothing makes sense.  It is in putting the whole trial together and considering multiple streams of unbiased evidence that we can make good decisions.  One thing is absolutely clear science labs have to be completely separate from the legal system and double blind testing is essential.  Then we can perhaps rely more on the system.,MakingaMurderer,d0il95e,7,t5_3b2cn
6761315,0,t3_48acpd,The only way this will ever get fixed on a mass scale....When a case of an innocent person getting put into jail is discovered there needs to be a MAJOR investigation all down the line of everyone who was involved in the case. From the state judges appellate judges local judges prosecutors police chiefs officers etc. If they through incompetence inaction or malice caused that person to go to jail unlawfully or kept him in jail longer by ignoring evidence or failing to review the case so their friends in the lower courts wouldnt lose a prosecution then all those people need to burn. Fire them all. Once the word is out that if you caused an innocent person to go to jail needs to be more than just mistakes...there needs to be malice intent and its found out afterwards your job is forfeit.

6766632,0,t1_d0j9dl4,Hi there.  These are my present thoughts whatever they are worth.    While I think the Avery pretrial press conference was a bad move and one that even Kratz now says he regrets I dont know that it nor any other argued element Ive heard bandied about at reddit as being an indicator of unfairness rises to meet a legal standard whereby the trial could be considered unfair and thus demanding retrial.   Well see what Ms. Zellner can dig up in this regard if retrial is what she seeks.  Dean Strang recently reflected that he didnt think it was possible for Avery to receive a fair trial anywhere in Wisconsin.  However as I understand it it was the defense team who elected to hold the trial in Manitowoc County rather than seek change of venue to another county when afforded the choice.    Ultimately yes I do think Avery got his fair trial upheld on appeal.  And yes I do think the considerable evidence against him made the jurys verdict very understandable regardless of the suggestions of MaM.  So personally Im completely satisfied with where he is barring revelatory information that I do not expect to be forthcoming.    You asked about Brendan and those waters are murkier.  Personally I do think that a number of indicators  e.g. Brendans initial omission of having had a bonfire that night Kayla seeking out counselors early on in January  to ask about blood coming up through concrete Brendan and his mother admitting to bleach stains on his jeans from a  x  foot of garage floor he testified to cleaning with bleach gasoline and paint thinner some things Brendan offered in his interviews  point towards Brendan having done some of it in his own words to his mother in a recorded phone call.    However the legal questions of whether he got the fairest shake and whether there was enough evidence to convict are more uncertain to me.  These may be for the more legal minded to decide.      On a personal level I do have sympathy for Brendan because whether guilty or innocent either way he was manipulated to a fair degree   either by a truly skeevy uncle whom Brendan admitted multiple times to fearing andor by investigators who coaxed and buddied up to him in a disingenuous manner befitting their professional duty to a fair degree to extract incriminating information  some of which I think was wellfounded other of which is uncertain questionable or outright untrue.  And I certainly do not believe Brendan would have participated in anything like this on his own.  On the other hand my personal sympathy is diminished a bit by my sense that he hasnt told the whole truth about the night of  and that his profession of complete innocence along with his uncles is disingenuous.    Hope the above contributes something.  I dont have all the answers obviously but I am personally convinced of Averys factual and legal guilt and will be very surprised if the needle moves at all for him in the upcoming weeks and months.,MakingaMurderer,d0j9zws,7,t5_3b2cn

6790785,0,t1_d0m0c5q,I agree with almost all of what youve said here. And clearly MaM is a slick wellproduced and compelling story. Of course decisions had to be made about what to include and what to leave out. But as I just said elsewhere in this this thread as far as I know it isnt standard practice to remove relevant sentences from conversations or edit interviews to make it look like the subject answered a different question than heshe really did  all while trying to camouflage the fact you did it. There are also examples where they edited words out from the middle of sentences including removing references to Zipperer from the the boss has something he wants us to do conversation and changing Tadychs testimony regarding his description of the bonefire from at least three fee high to three feet high. And Im sure youve seen the edit where they removed Brendan telling Barb about Avery molesting him and another female relative from a jailhouse phone call.Editing and presenting a narrative is fine but personally I think these types of edits and clearly going to some effort to hide them from the viewer cross a line. Obviously others dont see these techniques as a problem but I still think its a conversation worth having as it goes to the credibility of not just of MaM but documentaries in general.,MakingaMurderer,d0m0vj0,6,t5_3b2cn
6790991,0,t1_d0m0vj0,Edits are by nature always unnoticed. They are made to make things flow.I agree that one should not cut between one question and toward another answer. I am annoyed at that example as anyone should be. Never mind if it does not matter  it just lowers the credibility for no apparent reason. Like when this Nancy Grace states that SA left a VM at   not true.I think after having read a lot of the trial documents that the filmmakers could have attacked the forensics and bullet analyses much stronger. They could have focused much more on the contaminated DNA test of the bullet and the not perfect DNA match of bones. Also they could have focused on lack of documentation for the discovery of the bones etc. But even in  hours some things gotta go and they probably wanted a more human story than a nerdy science story.,MakingaMurderer,d0m1pv5,1,t5_3b2cn

6880540,0,t3_49yynd,OK Ill go first.  Here are two decisions and a few key tests that I see as likely being applicable to SA with some variation under Wisconsin law. A. Invalidating a conviction based on newly discovered evidence seems like the hardest burden.  SA must meet these four criteria the evidence itself not merely its materiality was newly discovered  the newly discovered evidence was not cumulative  the party could not using reasonable diligence have discovered and produced the evidence at trial and  the new evidence makes a different result probable on retrial.Criterion  seems difficult with most of the arguments we have seen on this sub so far.  Cell phone records and tower records were probably available.  Gaps and inconsistencies in the DNA testing is already in the record.  Likely breaks in chain of custody of evidence and possible tampering of evidence is already in the record.Then SA must show under criterion  that a different result at trial was PROBABLE if the newly discovered evidence was allowed.B.  Brady violations require a lesser showing of impact on the trial.Instead we have held that the Brady standard of materiality lies somewhere between the newlydiscovered evidence standard in which a new trial is warranted only if the new evidence would have changed the outcome of the original trial and the harmless error standard.  We ask whether the undisclosed evidence would have been significant to the defendant in the way that he tried his case . . . . So if KZ can show evidence in the possession or control of the State that was not disclosed and that evidence would have been significant to the defense relief should be warranted.C. Third general category of challenges seems most applicable based on KZs tweetsproof that the conviction was not a verdict worthy of either judicial or public confidence.  I put this as a catch all for constitutional violations and LE criminal activity.  It seems that proof of intentional planting of evidence or framing may be sufficient to challenge the verdict on its face. ,MakingaMurderer,d0w8302,6,t5_3b2cn

6945635,0,t3_4aujul,During the week after Teresa Halbach disappeared until he was arrested Steven Avery maintained that the MTSO were setting him up for her murder.   While he did not say LE actually killed Teresa or offer any suspects he did give a few ideas how it could of been done.   They are out to get me and my family and Ill go down. ... ... ... It was planted...A cop drove her vehicle into the back of the junkyard... Im going to call the FBI. ... ... ... Here Avery is musing out loud about how the car got into the Salvage Yard.  It sounds like he realizes people will want to know how it was done because he is trying to figure it out himself.  But who knows.Ive got a hunch they are spending so much time there they are finding evidence ... ... ... I just sit and wait and see if they will arrest me. What else can I do?  I cant run.    What if Avery had named several suspects in his statements to police?  Wouldnt they of had to investigate those people he named?  His statements were all recorded.  How can the defense present a comprehensive and detailed scenario with a suspect unnamed to avoid the Denny Rule with a timeline to convince the jury?  They tried to show Investigative Bias as well as a corrupt organization.  But even then by presenting an indepth and complex scenario did the defense risk confusing the jury?  The prosecutions theory was simple Avery killed her.   These are things I ponder. This article is about a study done about a defense strategy called TODDI the other dude did itHow does a criminal defense attorney argue for a Not Guilty verdict?  One strategy is simply to argue that the states case is incomplete and has not been proven beyond a reasonable doubt no more is required.  Another strategy is to provide alternative explanations of each piece of evidence for example how the defendants blood got in the victims car or that other people had keys to the home.  A more specific version of this strategy would be to provide a complete alternative storyimplicating unnamed or named othersthat explains all of the evidence.  Thus the defense may choose to enumerate some of the possible explanations for individual pieces of evidence or for the crime as a whole. TODDI This Other Dude Did It is a slang term for the defense strategy in which attorneys point to a specific other possible perpetrator who could have committed the crime. Our laboratory study suggests that a defense strategy that argues not only that the defendant is innocent but also that some other individuals could have committed the crime is more likely to result in acquittal.The study is available to download at the above link. It is interesting and a short read.  The prosecution just had to argue that justice for Teresa Halbach meant that her killer is found and punished.  The state presented her disappearance and death as an equation a puzzle with many pieces for which Steven Avery was the final solution. If the study is correct then the defense has to come up with a detailed story with a plausible theory and outline of a suspect.  Even then there would be no justice for the murder victim and her family as the real killer would still be out there.  edit grammar  ,MakingaMurderer,d13m9fo,1,t5_3b2cn

However when Kaylas testifies that what she said Brendan said is a lie it doesnt fit the theme of lying to get them out of trouble.  Also once we admit that the are willing to lie then it brings everything into question including there being a fire on  we dont know when they are lying or telling the truth at that point.  Its more plausible to me that their early testimonies were more accurate and then just became less so since even Steven himself later on talks about a fire with Brendan and him as if it happened on .  Hes remembering a fire they had but by then many months later the actual date is no longer a solid memory I couldnt remember what day I did some fairly common activity  months ago.  I wish they had tested that soil where they found the bones and then we might have some good info on whether or not there was a fire that night.  I heard a podcast from some forensic anthropologist who specializes in burn sites and he said that was very common to do to test what kind of fuel was used since fires take a lot of fuel to destroy bodies.  Not sure if they could verify that but having more data on that burn pit would be helpful.Not only that the fact that there were bones in other locations supports the story that there was no fire that night.  Did SA burn the body elsewhere then dump the bones next to his home and continue burning there?  It doesnt make any sense.  If the fire was on  then he murdered her and had a fire that night with people close by and that fire would have had to been huge and burn very long to do that to her remains.  Then he puts some of the bones in a barrel and just moves them around a bit?  Also he transports her from his home to the burn site a dozen feet away using her own vehicle?

6992812,0,t3_4bf0tz,I think you have been confused by what you have read.  Id be interested to hear specifically where you think they did not adhere to the published method but maybe I can help interpret what you are misreading.EDTA is added to blood samples to keep them from coagulating and clotting.  Blood clots through a cascade of reactions that happen in a specific sequence.  This sequence requires the metal element calcium Ca to be present and to participate.  EDTA is a chelating agent and ties up the Ca in the blood preventing its participation in the clotting cascade and preserving the blood in an unclotted condition.Iron Fe is also a metal in the blood and EDTA complexes with iron also.  Because iron is more abundant than Ca the test method is set up to look at the Fe complex instead of Ca.  To ensure that all the Ca ions are chelated a large excess amount of EDTA is put into solution in the blood.  The EDTA that does not complex with a metal is called free and the test method also looks for this.  In the spot cards you referenced above the iron complex was detected in  cards and the free EDTA was detected in  cards.  IIRC LeBeau in his testimony surmised that the iron complex was less stable the FeEDTA complex came apart so there was again free iron and free EDTA neither the iron or the EDTA disappear.A problem arose in the testing and initial testimony in the OJ trial in that the equipment setup was causing some carryover or crosscontamination between successive sample injections.  They ran a positive control known to contain EDTA and then the unknown sample from the case blood from OJs socks and a very small amount of EDTA showed up in the case sample.  It was determined that this result was due to EDTA lingering in the equipment from the previous sample and the problem was solved in that case by running blank samples nonEDTA blood between test samples.  It was determined that the EDTA was chelating to the Copper tubing connecting the equipment and being held up that way.  So switching this to stainless steel tubing nickelcontaining solved the problem and eliminated the need for blank samples and this is what LeBeaus method implementation used.The copper used in the  paper was a copper sulphate solution used to extract the blood from the sample media and form a CuEDTA complex.  This worked well for ion chromatography a different method but when run through the MS it caused electrical arcing.  So the authors developed an alternate extraction technique using only DI water and this solved the arcing problem.  LeBeau used the water extraction.  The review article addressed the same problem by using a nickel nitrate solution to do the extraction.  This part did not apply to the FBI method as they did not use it.The confusion over LeBeau creating a method in  stems from two factors.  First in the interim between the OJ and Avery trials the FBI laboratory had been moved from Washington DC to Quantico VA.  In the move not all equipment was relocated and reinstalled some was replaced andor updated.  This was the case of the specific LCMSMS equipment from the original EDTA testing.  LeBeau utilized newer updated models.  Also partly due to the Whitehurstraised issues the FBI instituted new quality procedures for their laboratory work.  IIRC LeBeau indicated that at the time of the Avery investigations the quality procedures were on their third iteration since the OJ trial.  So what LeBeau did was take the original published method and implement that on the new equipment and then document it in the format required for the new quality procedures.  The first time a method is written within a quality procedure it is described as a new document.  Subsequent revisions would have a revision date and number and the creation date and revision history dates would be listed.  LeBeau did not create a new procedure as many people assert he implemented the procedure published in  which was created prior to and outside the quality system and documented it within the quality system.Edit  Corrected discussion of the different metal ions after rereading the  paper.  Italics section is added.,MakingaMurderer,d18z7j8,2,t5_3b2cn

7085340,0,t1_d1jh4ww,This is what I posted on another threadKZ definitely believes the cell phone argument. She seems to be basing her argument on the tower numbers of the calls to TH on her cellphone records. She mentions last ping which indicates either that she does not know that a call is not a ping or that she has access to cell tower data showing all the pings.    Heres the argument for the airtight alibi  Look at the following list of THs cell records from  Exhibit Time .........|| Elapsed || Towerlt PM ||  || ltincoming went to voicemail PM ||  || ltincoming Autotrader call PM ||  || ltincoming from Avery PM ||  || ltoutgoingTH checking voicemail PM ||  || ltoutgoingTH call to Zipperers PM ||  ||  ltincomingwent to voicemailThe argument is that TH calls being serviced by cell tower  at  then by tower  between  and  pm and then again by tower  at  is consistent with a loop from Zipperers to Averys and then back to Zipperers. That is the basis for the airtight alibi.gtHOWEVER ... If a call is placed from one cell phone to another and the call may go into the recipients mail box the ...call shows as connected. However the tower reading will reflect the tower from which the call originated. source  The two incoming calls at  and  both went to voicemail source  Thus the tower on THs cell record could be the tower that the call originated from   and  which are two different sectors of the same cell tower if the last number tells us the sector of the tower. Thus these two calls are not telling us conclusively that TH left Averys compound creating an alibi for SA.The same problem occurred in the Adnan case gtOutgoing calls only are reliable for location status. Any incoming calls will NOT be considered reliable information for location.There is a lot of good information about cell tower data in this thread,MakingaMurderer,d1jhnid,2,t5_3b2cn

Hence why the conflict between the extreme elements of the guilty and innocence sides.Those on the guilty side will default to the evidence and verdict from the original trial and demand those on the innocent side to disprove or come up with new evidence. The biggest problem is that any such evidence is unlikely to come from your regular Redditor who doesnt have some direct link to the case.

7086675,0,t1_d1jm0vm,Thats cool.  There is articles to the contrary though. gtAbstractA deliberate attempt to remove biological material using a variety of cleaning agents is a problem faced by forensic scientists routinely. The substrates on which the blood is supported can also have an inhibitory role. This study aimed to investigate the potential contribution that these factors have on DNA analysis. In addition time between deposition and collection of trace evidence was also considered. Blood samples were applied to a number of different substrates. After drying the stains were cleaned with chlorinated bleach soap or disinfectant until no visible trace remained. DNA was extracted from the cleaned areas and PCR performed using the AmpFLSTR SGM Plus PCR Amplification kit Applied Biosystems. In excess of  profiles were examined and characterised. Heterozygote imbalance Hbx split peak frequency SPF and stutter proportion SP were used to assess the clarity of the electropherograms and the ability to relate evidence and control suspect samples. In this day study chlorinated bleach had the most pronounced negative effects with respect to the characteristics considered.  Did you even read the article you linked? Because in there it said...gtExtracted DNA with No Wiping ResultsAt the end of the quantitation all of the samples mixed with disinfectants gave a negative quantitation result. This at first appeared to be successful destruction of the extracted DNA however on closer inspection it was determined that the disinfectants interfered with the polymerase chain reaction PCR process. This was seen by the action of the internal PCR control IPC when compared to samples that were mixed with a buffer at the same concentrations. The samples mixed with bleach solution did not have any IPC cross the threshold. In samples mixed with STERIPLEX SD the IPC did cross but it crossed  cycles after the sample with abuffer. In samples mixed with Pure Blu the IPC did cross but it crossed  cycles after the sample with a buffer.This means that all the disinfectants inhibit the PCR process with bleach solution being the most inhibitive followed by Pure Blu. STERIPLEX SD causes the least amount of inhibition......Because if you did it does not mention that DNA was destroyed by the bleach rather that bleach inhibits the PCR testing.Did you skip the results?  Because this is what they said regarding bleach.gtBleach solution  part blood to  parts disinfectant  fold reduction in DNAfold reduction?

7123817,0,t3_4d5ctu,When taking an emotional approach we often see that from LE and other people processing the case people would always choose option A because of their romantic notion to help the family of the victim and give them closure. And such an approach can give the victims family some closure if they can convince themselves its the right guy thats behind the bars. But even from this perspective this creates another set of victims the wrongfully imprisoned and his family. And in rarer cases when even the murder victims family doesnt believe the right killer to be behind bars such an approach has absolutely no benefits other than to boost conviction rates and create a false image of the effectiveness of the legal system. Option A is extremely flawed and ideological.Option B on the other hand doesnt create any more unnecessary victims of the crime and was put in practice for a reason. Its the correct and logical choice which only people guided by emotion dont agree with weve seen plenty of those in MaM and in this and other subreddits relating to this very case. Legal systems should not be guided by emotion and from a legal perspective only option B is the correct one. There really isnt much to be discussed about why that shouldnt be the case without wading into before mentioned idealogical waters.So within this debate Id personally go for option B both from the legal and emotional aspect. I doubt my family members would ever be convinced by such a scam of a trial and instead of getting closure theyd support and fight for the person accused in option A. Having done so theyd probably receive ridicule from the emotional option A supporters and even threats from LE we were only doing this to help you back off!. I guess having a cause to fight for would lessen the pain of a close member passing away but it wouldnt be pleasant fighting windmills all their lives and receiving backlash from the most unpleasant bunch of people.All in all not option A only ever works for people guided purely by emotion and belief and even in that case its only beneficial for some of the people involved because it creates many more victims in the process.TLDR B.,MakingaMurderer,d1nw8sc,6,t5_3b2cn

7165512,0,t3_4dkukx,Ill try to answer OPs question.Wouldnt the framers take a huge risk of framing SA while knowing the real killer was still out there? For all they know the real killer could have been caught  days later for another murder. The killer then could admit to murdering TH as well and be able to prove it thus bringing huge investigation into who framed SA?The key is the most obviously planted evidence right? Well their story was that the key dropped from behind the nightstand yes? Wouldnt that be a huge risk as well? What if one or more honest detectives who searched the trailer before would testify that Hey! I totally checked behind that desk few days earlier on my search! There was NO key back there!... Pretty much same goes with the bullet found in garage? In other words if i was Lenk or Colborn i would only plant evidence in places that i know have not been searched yet. So IF the key and the bullet was planted wouldnt the detectives who searched the desk and the area from where the bullet was found know if they are planted or not? So if we were to believe the Framed story we would have to also believe that there our detectives out there who are just keeping their mouth shut? Whoever was assigned to search the desk area for the first time should be fired from his job for not finding the key... Either that or to speak up and say that i DID search it! there was no key!The point is that framing SA seems highly risky to me with potential to destroy their livelihoods.On top of all the framing they really got lucky with Brendan testifying and stuff cause i just finished watching all his interviews and it was not all that coerced really guys  i dont know what kinda twisted mind you have to watch the interviews to think he is innocent? He did it at first he was willing to confess only helping SA with the bonfire he left out the part about going to his trailer. Detectives knew that he was lying because Brendan kept saying he played PS until SA called which we all know SA never called Brendan. It made a lot of sense to me the way he was thinking which parts he will admit and which parts he has to lie about. I think he was most open in the interview right before he was arrested and had to go to jail since in some weird way he thought hed go back to school after admitting it all. In the following interviews he goes back on his original story of course wanting to get out of jail. In his last interviews last part when Detectives reveal Brendan that they have all the phone records thats when Brendan starts to give the real confession again he understood he got caught and was no reason to lie there. It did come to me as a shocker when Brendan revealed in the end that they had planned the kidnap few days before halloween. Thethe story of knocking on the trailer  times while hearing screams inside the trailor sounded weird i would think a normal  year old boy would run to his momma at that point...

7176559,0,t1_d1t7i3y,She could.  uOpenMindU is incorrect.  But another control sample is useless without another evidence sample.The point of a control sample is to check for crosscontamination.  So lets say youre running first a known sample of the victims DNA.  Then youre going to run the evidence sample from the bullet.  You want to make sure the equipment is completely cleaned in between and there wasnt still some DNA left over from the first test that will make it look like the victims DNA is on the bullet when it really isnt.  So in between those two samples you run a control sample.  If that doesnt have the victims DNA on it you know you properly cleaned the equipment theres no crosscontamination so everythings good.In this case Culhane got some of her own DNA on the control.  The control was still negative for Teresas DNA so it served its purpose of proving there was no crosscontamination between samples and Teresas DNA really was on the bullet.  But creating a new control sample to run wouldve been pointless because the test was done and there was no longer a need to prove there hadnt been crosscontamination.  It would just be running a blank sample for no purpose.  You would need to create a new evidence test sample to run the whole test again and the test sample is created by washing the bullet with a special solution to get the DNA off so after you make that first sample youre kinda SOL on getting a second one.  You already washed the DNA off.  But ultimately the control sample did prove there was no crosscontamination so its not as big a deal as people want it to be that it had Culhanes DNA on it.  The point is that it didnt have Teresas.,MakingaMurderer,d1twqlk,3,t5_3b2cn

Grant says that one cannot really use what is public information. I.e. there is not enough information to corroborate Zellners claims. Pinging a tower  miles away does not mean you are standing right next to the tower.So Zellners statements are a bit cryptic here as she states the defense did not use available information properly. So it must imply that there was more detailed records circulating but that only a subset of those went into trial and thus into the publicly available evidence.But when she talks about things she has access to which the public do not it is only police records she mentions.

If anything I find it crude to lump them into the same category. Steven has a low IQ and minimal life experience sure but that doesnt put him on Brendans level. Brendan is learning disabled  amongst other things  and has little to no personality capacity or initiative. I dont say that to be mean just to make a point.Brendan had to go on that stand so the jury could hear him say in his own words thats not my story I lied Im recanting. He so lacks any initiative that theres little they could do to rip him apart up there this is a kid whose main testimony is yeah and I dont know. They had more to gain from putting him on the stand sympathy than they had to lose he couldnt look much worse or say much of anything damaging.

7234301,0,t3_4eh5xs,I think Mike was used by Kratz to bolster his case. I also think he deleted some of the voice mails off Teresas phone. If that action would have pointed the finger at someone other than Avery.. Kratz prepared the call record exhibits used at trial as well as that sketchy voice mail record print out. And he almost had a stroke when Buting pushed the issue at trial.Ryan had been her life  years. Onoff OFF relationship. Gets her phone records by whatever means on her PC. Weigert is ok with that. Seems to be ok with eveyone in LE? He isnt a family member and doesnt tell them up front about his long relationship with Teresa. My question is how long has Ryan been in her phone records? Clearly he had no problem going into her room and getting on her PC. He could have easily had that info at home as well.

Didnt SA already tell them in two different interviews that he had seen lights up in that area on Thursday night and took a flashlight but couldnt find anyone?  If you believe someone planted the evidence well there is a strong point to that.  Anyway  the way I read the report is that they took BB from behind Jandas and Averys not SA he also did tell them he hadnt burned garbage for a long time and that corroborates with the taking of the BB.

7303555,0,t1_d28csv8,It depends on where its denied. The answer to a complaint only requires what the defendant knows personally. Does Kocourek know Averys address without looking it up? Maybe but likely not. I know about three addresses offhand and each one is a close friend or family. Could Kocourek look it up and then know it? Sure but that defeats the purpose of the answer namely to find out the position of the other side. So it goes with the remainder of the more obvious portions of the complaint. There is literally no upside to admitting an allegation before conducting discovery. Okay I suppose one could imagine admitting something that is completely harmless if only to not look like a total asshole. Generally however the answer is not the place to make a stand. Its to deny deny deny and move on. If youre wondering why have an answer in the first place if all the other side does is deny? then youre asking a great question. In all my years of practicing law I dont know. Its one of those formalities that still exist despite its almost complete uselessness. But its the way it works. ,MakingaMurderer,d28d5ij,21,t5_3b2cn

I did write up a summary of the EDTA and what I believed to be its limitations back in January. I have no reason to believe that EDTA reacts or behaves any different on filter paper cards than on vinyl or painted metal. EDTA doesnt have a particularly high deterioration rate. EDTA in tubes is in great excess to the amount required to bind all Fe and Ca ions and the bound EDTA is the kind thats more likely to degrade if at all. But it doesnt vanish traces of it can still be present. In the blood spot cards the free EDTA was found  of the time. The FeEDTA something like . The test of the spots from the car looked for both free and FeEDTA and found not a whiff of either. Controls in scientific experiments are meant to provide a reasonable way to be sure outside factors arent influencing your testing. Controls are not meant to exactly replicate experimental conditions. If there was some hint that drying of the blood led to a loss in signal detection or that the years old blood spot cards would have meant a total inability to detect EDTA it would have been reasonable to perform different controls. But what they did was entirely reasonable and the conclusion that there was no EDTA in the blood from the car seems similarly reasonable to me. ,MakingaMurderer,d2eyi8y,3,t5_3b2cn

There was certainly no kind of hesitation that would have been caused by an injury. Then they said dont bother and he pulled his hand back. It was dark but the TV lights were on. There was no bandage I could see on his rd finger and obviously no blood was found on that station wagon or we would certainly heard about it. Diana and her staff did not notice it either. I am pretty sure that his finger was not cut at that time. See for yourself.Next morning on Saturday he claimed he cut his finger while unloading the tin for the roof repair. Certainly his brother Chuck would know about that. I believe the cops were still there preparing to tow SAs car because they got word the RAV was found. Someone could have phoned the info of his cut finger after Saturday morning. Too bad we didnt see any interior photos by Pam.I dont think his finger was cut before Saturday morning.

The report said that TK stated  the reason that he investigated the case was because none of his team of detectives were available as they were working other cases. Really!! What were these experienced detectives all working on in Manitowoc that was more important than a case involving charges of attempted first degree murder first degree sexual assault and false imprisonment?

7500582,0,t1_d2ugzo0,Yes. Both the state and the defendant can appeal both the verdict and the sentence.But as in any other case there is a risk that it doesnt go the way you want it  and sometimes we see defendants who appeal their case and get a longer sentence than they got in st instance. Tough luck.I guess I like the Danish system better because you IMO get a fair trial. Compared to the Avery case the jury have read the newspapers and seen all the media attention the case got and they are even from the same state as Avery if I remember right. This could happen in Denmark as well but then you would appeal for nd instance and get some unbias and objective judges. Another thing that is a lot different is that prosecutors in Denmark almost NEVER do interviews beforeduring a casetrial. Sometimes they give a statement on the final verdictsentence but thats about it. Maybe it is because the prosecutors are not a part of the investigation like in the US. The Danish police do the investigation and hands it over to the prosecutor. The prosecutor can then ask for certain areas that needs more investigation to get a solid case but that doesnt happen that often. I guess this goes along with my original post about doing cases on behalf of the state and not winning cases  cause they are not your own and you dont get to feel that way because you havent been part of a longterm investigation.,MakingaMurderer,d2urzxi,1,t5_3b2cn

But now Manitowocs mayor says its time to make things happen.gt The condition of KRATZ has been getting worse and worse year after year said Mayor Justin Nickels.gt Last year the city condemned KRATZ giving the owner a deadline of the end of   for demolishing KRATZ.gt Its a legal process that gives the owner the ability to demolish KRATZ on his own and if not the city will come and demolish it said Nickels.gt And that is what the city wants to do just not through the normal condemnation process in which the city bills the owner for the demolition costs. To avoid the courts and to speed up this project Mayor Nickels wants the owner to give KRATZ to Manitowoc and in turn the city will pay demolition costs.gt Fortunately weve been having good discussions with the owner about that and Im positive by summer well have something to share with the public Mayor Nickels said.gt Nickels says the city has over  million set aside for the work which he hopes could begin in the fall.  After demolition the city would sell KRATZ for development looking for a project that adds to the citys tax base.gt We think it can be something very positive for that stretch into our downtown said Nickels.gt While also taking away an eye sore once and for all.A giggle or two there. ,MakingaMurderer,d32srjb,15,t5_3b2cn

7579033,0,t3_4j4qbe,First of all welcome to our happy Reddit family!I think youve ask very good question. But before providing you my opinionated answer I would like to tell you a short story.Prosecution was rushed with this EDTA test kind of behind defense back. Here is very interesting FBI document dated .. right before the trial starts which gives no time for defense to be ready and to be prepared properlyThe purpose of this request is to establish the presence of EDTA in the vile of blood thereby eliminating the allegation that this vial was used to plant evidence.Moving further youre correct FBI didnt perform DNA test only EDTA. But would you agree that prosecution would NOT take the risk by sending FBI some fake blood without knowing ahead of time that itll be good valid result??? In another word like lawyers used to say dont ask question if you dont know the answer. So imo prosecution knew what answer theyll get back. And theyre not gonna take the risk in case if FBI decides to do DNA test...so how this can be accomplished no EDTA and no risk? Simple send to FBI the true SA blood sample...but not taken from RAV but from another car who was in the same lab Grand AM who had plenty of SA blood stains....no EDTA no risk!...just my opinion I have zero proof. ,MakingaMurderer,d33p79o,14,t5_3b2cn

7607483,0,t1_d36k7qi,There was a TED Talk a little while ago that focused on what you are saying Ill try to find it so I can link you. The speaker is a lawyer who talks about how much we ultimately spend on confining and killing criminals in our prison system its a shocking amount of  per incarcerated. He contrasts that amount with how much it would cost to provide these folks with a safe living environment food security and quality educations. It is far less money. So basically we can invest early on and prevent criminality or we can spend a lot more later on both to imprison the criminal and also to addressattempt to rectify the social loss or social damage the criminal inflicts on everyone. The former is seen as welfare or mooching the system so people balk at it and apparently prefer the second option...Prevention is cheaper and better for everyone but we dont do it. ETA This was the one I was talking about These are good too though There is one with another guy... Dan Pachulky? I probably have that wrong Ill try to find him too.

If it rang in the middle of an awkward situation and it startled the killer they probably would have been spooked by the phone and tossed it. If the theory of her phone dying is true that could blow a lot of other theories out of the water considering her timeline could be altered drastically.

I am not SA though so dont be scared. Really? If he wanted to lure her he wouldve done so just like the perp during the  call. I honestly dont comprehend why this is so difficult to grasp. You are so totally right. There is no indication that TH knew she was going to SA. Only the lead sheet and the fact that she had been out there before and did business with them. Thats it no big deal. No big deal for the road to be named Avery rd. No big deal that TH said she knew it was the Avery brothers. Also no big deal that she told the yahoo dude she had plans on going to SA the next day. Or how about this supposed call that SA made to TH at  as Wiegert states? Youre right I see nothing that indicates TH knew where she was going. ETA FYI if Avery was so slick and wanted to lure her and if she had no idea she was meeting SA then why would he call her period? Why not sit back wait for her to swing on thru and do what he had planned? He didnt. If he knew she was coming all he had to do was wait.

7653246,0,t1_d3bx2u1,I have no vitriol.  I am just mirroring your asinine way of communicating.  You argue points by not actually arguing points but rather deflecting exaggerating and ignoring.  A good example is when you went into your drama act about Daisy Fuentes keeping a record of every single person whoever purchased a pair of their jeans as well as the rant you went on about in this last post.  You have no answer to the argument so you argue the ridiculous and imply insults.  Its a weak form of arguing and only shows what a weak argument you have in the first place.  Otherwise you would argue actual points and not have to resort to such stupidity.  I suppose it at least makes you feel like you answered some imagined challenge and you still feel some empty victory in having the last word but you still really have provided nothing of substance to the conversation.  Its an earthisflat level of self imposed ignorance type thinking that one would rather not be exposed to a truth than question something that seems illogical.Ok now to answer your questionsWhat in your opinion would be the benefit of contacting the manufacturer? Confirming that the rivets with Daisy Fuentes stamped on them came from the Daisy Fuentes brand?No its just an example of a more official determination than THs kid sisters thoughts on what jeans her sister MIGHT have had. he asked me to pick out a pair of Daisy Fuentes jeans that I thought Teresa would have worn.Remember noone knows what brands of jeans TH wore that day but the killer and even he might not have stopped to take notice.  All we have to go on is a picture of  rivet.  Now where did that rivet come from?  Is there any proof that it came from the fire pit?  Are there photos of the rivet in the fire pit?  Are there photos of itthem in the sifter after being sifted from the ash?  Is the metadata of the photo prior to the Kohls shopping trip?  Is there proof of it?Noow  doo    yoou     uunderstand    whyy   soome   peeople    miiight   fiiind   iit   shaady    ?  typed slowly to aid comprehension.Can you give a valid reason at all that a detective would have to take a young lady to Kohls to shop for a pair of pants she thought her sister might wear?  ,MakingaMurderer,d3c4qll,1,t5_3b2cn

7679710,0,t3_4ki9f2,Im glad you broughtup the relationship between these two agencies MTSO and CASO and ask who used whom not your words exactly...but point is well taken. Here what I think happened.Yes TH missing person report was filed at Calumet and hence investigation shouldmust initiated by them...however right from the beginning CASO contacted whom? MTSO. Why? Because according to Calumet it was based on TH workrelated appointments hence Avery. And Calumet absolutely knew about all these lawsuits and conflict of interest...so who would be the BEST VENDETTA driven agency to use? Of course MTSO!!! IMO it was all planed very early on...And the fact that Remiker said on the STAND at the trial that it was actually the Calumet whos barking on the wrong tree  makes me believe that MTSO was trying to DISTANCE themselves from Calumet kind of blaming them...very nice strategy which was absolutely LIE. MTSO not just provided assistance regardless of conflict of interest! but truly inserted themselves in the full everyday investigation with all major evidence discovered by these honorable MTSO professionals. Calumet and MTSO wereis partners in crime!...and absolutely no reason to assume otherwise....jmo,MakingaMurderer,d3f4xuz,10,t5_3b2cn

7694951,0,t1_d3gl4rt,The police framed him for rape and possibly murder.  Is it to much to suspect they may have said the gun was loaded when it wasnt?   As for the lies without recordings I have a hard time with them for the same reason  we know SA answers questions very directly and with little scope.   I was unaware he claimed no guns at all were in the the house but without hearing the discussion itself I dont necessarily trust a written down description.  For example if he was asked do you have a pistol in the house he might answer no and the police could then write down when asked if he possessed a gun Avery said no.  Im not arguing this is what happened I am arguing we have police proven in  to be motivated to frame him and therefore I trust little in their reports about these events.  They clearly were working from a position of bias in regards to Avery to an extreme degree and so what would normally be relatively trustworthy police reports become inherently questionable.,MakingaMurderer,d3gv6w3,2,t5_3b2cn

As far as Im aware no MaMrelated subreddit is directly associated with the makers of the television series so your endorsement or lack thereof is meaningless. My impression from the official explanation here is that the bizarre and abrupt changes to this sub are the result of it simply becoming too big for its britches and therefore all speculation and theory is being corralled into another sub where readership will likely be more restricted. That said I doubt there are many people wholl have a great deal of confidence in the same moderators that silenced the sort of discussion that was once the bread and butter of this sub now being in charge at a smaller sub. ,MakingaMurderer,d3j5b3m,6,t5_3b2cn

We simply store criminals away for the duration of their sentences and then release them back into society without the skills or means to become productive or selfsufficient.Back at the turn of the century prisons were run differently. They were often factories where the inmates worked and learned marketable job skills. But then other businesses began complaining that they couldnt compete with the lower costs of the goods and services being produced and provided by prison factories so the concept was mostly abandoned. These days prisons can only produce goods and provide services for governmental purposes license tags maintenance etc.  ,MakingaMurderer,d3nr78k,2,t5_3b2cn

Chuck now maybe.  He reportedly pursued a woman who had no interest in him.   SAs other crimes were with women with whom he had a relationship that he had spoken probably briefly to TH a half dozen times hardly constitutes a relationship.Dawn said wearing a towel not only a towel as I recall.  But people hung up on the towel incident always say that.  Its not disgusting.  MA was a young woman perhaps flattered by attention.   Its my understanding that she didnt report this immediately and in fact not until her mother who didnt like SA apparently got involved.  If you read MAs own testimony she continued to go places such as Barbs house  where she knew she would be alone with SA.  I didnt say it was okay in fact I said it was not.  And I didnt say she wanted it.  But she may have sent signals.   Only she and SA know if it was consensual.  Did she lie about it?  Exaggerate it?  Did she think she was in trouble with her parents?   I dont know and neither do you.   But the police and DA whose job it was to prosecute such charges decided not to reportedly because the victim didnt want them to.  Either way I agree it was completely stupid and wrong of SA.

8195841,0,t1_d51zzry,Greetings reddit newbie.  Your first  minutes here have been busy ones...      gtBut if Avery is not responsible for his blood in Halbachs car then his blood has no tendency to suggest his guilt at all. Quite to the contrary he cannot be linked to her car at all in that event.    The car could still be said to have been found on Averys property with the license plates tossed into junked cars along a path from the RAV towards Steven Averys residence.      gt Indeed at least one Manitowoc County sheriffs Department emproyee with a crucial role in this case and whose actions had been questioned in his deposition in Averys civil case less than three weeks before Teresa Halbach disappeared was involved in septembet  in transmitting to the Crime Laboratory some evidence from the same court file at issue now... Lenk...     However.  The transmittal form Lt. Lenk signed did not include the box the blood vial was kept in the form covered some nail clippings and hair but no blood vial.    There is no record of any member of the Manitowoc County Sheriffs Department including James Lenk of having custody or knowing about a blood sample.  Inv. Mark Wiegert Review of Materials at the Manitowoc County Clerks Office .  See CASO Report pages  and .    Additionally the county clerk testified she hadnt seen Lt. Lenk or Sgt. Colborn at the clerks office at all during the relevant months    In any event it remains that the bloodplanting theory is speculative and as of right now completely unproven.    And it remains that Jerry Buting has made some faulty assertions about the blood vial  about its hole and its traces of collected blood between stopper and glass  in an attempt to forward the theory.

8863892,0,t3_5101b3,The main reason I believe Avery is guilty is there is no other way to explain all the evidence that is reasonable.  What we know Avery has a history of abuse alleged rape and attacks on women and children even at gunpoint.  Attacking a woman hes had repeated contact with is completely within his character. Avery against Barbs wishes decided to list Barbs van in AT.  He called and specifically asked for Teresa.  I dont know if he was plotting to murder her but he definitely wanted to see her. Teresa was young pretty and feisty.  She thought Avery was gross.  This is very low on the list of importance but it gives us an idea of motive.  He was interested she was feisty enough to reject him in a way that pisses him off he snapped. When Teresa was alive and her phone was on Avery called her twice using  to hide his number.  Any excuse about privacy is bullshit.  He didnt use it when calling anyone else that day.  Hed already met with her a number of times even calling her directly to set up a hustle shot.  He didnt use it when calling her after her phone was disabled.  He insists they only spoke for a few minutes to pay the bill hi and bye so its not like something happened in those few minutes to convince him that after meeting so many times he finally trusted her with his cell number and didnt need to hide it anymore.  The most logical explanation is that he knew she wouldnt answer a call from him while alive and he knew she wouldnt be screening calls at pm. Teresa who had been on her phone all day never used it again after being at Averys.  She was never seen or heard from again after being at Averys. Avery was seen burning something in the burn barrel in front of his house a few hours after his meeting with her.  When first interviewed he denied having used that barrel recently.  Teresas electronics were found in that barrel burned. Avery was seen and admitted to having a fire in the pit the night she disappeared.  He originally denied having had a fire recently.  Teresas bones were found in that pit burned. Avery chose that one day to not go back to work in the afternoon.  He insists that was not common he always went back to work.  Except the one day a pretty young woman comes to visit him and is never seen again.  His explanation?  He had phone calls to make.  Except he didnt make any except to Teresa until pm and that one was to his brother whom he wouldve seen at work.  Avery insisted in early interviews after his meeting with Teresa he putzed around a bit going to see if Bobby was home and briefly chatting with his mom when she stopped by but otherwise listened to the radio and was in bed watching porn by pm.  His recorded phone call with Jodi proves Brendan was over cleaning at that time and he Brendan and multiple witnesses all agreed he was actually having a bonfire with his nephew all night.  Coincidentally Brendan also apparently completely forgot this multihour cleaning and bonfire session within a week because he also failed to mention it in his early interviews.  Any innocent man who has an alibi gives that alibi I couldnt have done it I was with Brendan all night ask him!  Only a man who knows that bones are going to be found in that fire pit is going to omit mention of the fire and instead lie about being in bed early alone. Speaking of Brendan instead of retyping it all I direct you to this comment Teresas car is found on the Avery Salvage Yard.  The license plates have been removed and placed in a car across the yard on the path back to Stevens house.  Teresas blood is found in the car.  Averys blood is also found in six different places in the car including a long passive drip in a door well.  Avery had a fresh cut on his hand.  Any claim the police swabbed up some dried blood drops from the bathroom to make those drips is frankly idiotic you cant swab up a dried stain and somehow make it drip as are claims there were fresh pools of Averys blood just lying around the salvage yard to drip.  If the blood was planted it wouldve come from the vial.  Except there is no proof anywhere that Lenk or Colborn knew of this vials existence prior to .  It was tested for their prints.  It was tested for EDTA.  The blood from the vial?  High levels of EDTA detected.  The blood from the car?  Nope none.  LCMSMS is a ridiculously common and verified science.  Attempts to tear it apart are desperate grabbing at straws.  To make the EDTA undetectable the blood would have to be so diluted it would look like water.  Not to mention that the defense made no effort to test the blood the one thing that could definitively prove their client was framed and actually hid their intent to use it in trial until the last second hoping the prosecution would not have time to test it either.  To me the blood is the most important piece because once you prove it wasnt planted there is no explanation for Averys blood to be dripped and smeared throughout Teresas car. Although reading all about the EDTA test sealed it for me Ill go on.  Teresas key is found in Averys bedroom.  Its found next to a bookcase with a loose back panel that had been twisted away from the wall.  Is it weird that it wasnt found on the first search which was cut short as it was late and stormy and instead was found when they continued the search?  Yes its weird.  But is it less weird then believing somehow Lenk obtained this key planted Averys DNA on it walked into the room after a few hours of searching threw it on the floor and said Oh look a key!?  Yes imo its way less weird.  If he was planting a key after multiple entries into the trailer and hours of searching he had plenty of time to stash it in a drawer or closet or under the bed and either let someone else find it or pretend to have found it stashed somewhere.  You cant tell me hes genius enough to orchestrate this whole plot without leaving a trace of evidence but couldnt think of a better way to plant the key.  No to me the most reasonable explanation is that it slid out the back of the broken bookcase when Colborn pulled it away from the wall and tilted it. Eventually Brendan points them to the garage as a crime scene.  If you havent yet read the Brendan comment I linked above.  When the police pull everything out to do a thorough search of the garage they find a bullet with Teresas DNA ballistically linked to Averys gun.continued below,MakingaMurderer,d7dbcy9,10,t5_3b2cn

9991450,0,t3_5ihs4i,I dont know but has this tendency been examined for various countries? My amateur theory is based on the fact that many important elections in the US end up in a choice between two candidatesplatforms. So contrary to multiparty systems predominant in many European countries it could facilitate this form of tribalism. Plus having a president declaring that If you are not with us you are against us was probably not exactly helpful if people took that up as a rule of living.Many places in Europe thus have governments at local and state level that comprise more views and thus are results of compromises. I think this tendency to seek compromise dampens the tribalism a bit at least you want to understand how far away you are from a potential partner.I can still get surprised when I at TTM ask a clarifying question about the logic of some theory and are basically told to be a guilter.,MakingaMurderer,db9wwnt,1,t5_3b2cn

The evidence package was opened as stipulated by both the state and Averys defense at the time for the purpose of testing in . This is what eventually led to his exoneration for the  rape.

10532597,0,t1_dd1oltp,Out of the videos k views no one has pointed out any errors which is why Id love potential naysayers to actually watch the video. But Ill give you the surface answer. For TH to leave Schmitz at pm it would have taken her  minutes to drive to Zipperes making her earliest arrival time pm. So when she left the pm voicemail where she stated she was having trouble finding the place. We know this to be a white lie. She couldnt have made it to Zipperes by pm and she would have actually had to arrive earlier than that if shes claiming she has spent any length of time looking for the property.  However had she traveled straight to SA the travel time puts her earliest arrival at . Which happens to coencide with SA call to TH where he disconnected before it went to voice mail. Perhaps the reason he disconnected is because he saw her vehicle entering his property. Now you may ask why lie to Zipperer well SA was a high priority client and had phoned her a few times throughout the day. Its perfectly reasonable for TH to go to SA who is obviously being persistent and go to Zipperers after since Z is a one off client and lower priority. So when TH said she was on her was to SA on her call with AT she was telling the truth.

10564794,0,t3_5ra64d,I think its been a year since Ive seen this series but for some reason I felt like a lot of the reasons why I felt he was innocent or the things that couldnt be explained were explained by the scenario laid out here. Some of them being lack of blood in the bedroom was because she was already dead when he cut her throat. The reason for  shell casings being in the garage. The reason you would transport the body in the Rav  at all was because they were just too lazy to drag the body to the fire pit. Explains how the key got behind the dresser but not how it was missed the first time. It also explains how there would be blood in the places on the vehicle and the key. Some things that are missing is how the heck there wasnt any pieces of the camera and other tech equipment recovered in the fire if they were thrown in it. You would think pieces of the lens would have been recovered. This also changes my opinion of Dasseys involvement. I seriously thought the guy was innocent. Now I dont know. It also seems like a fairly convenient recollection for the prosecution this late in the game as previously mentioned. ,MakingaMurderer,dd5n0fn,4,t5_3b2cn

11220895,0,t1_df3po4r,Thats why I was careful in the wording. However it is more than just opinion that it was a place that the type of vehicles Steven Avery in particular liked to keep and work on were kept. There is documented proof of that. Of course none of that means that he definitely put those vehicles there or that it was his stash as you say. You dont find it at all odd that the ridge was a spot where Wagoneers and Samurai were kept and a Samurai was in Averys garage and Avery had crushed a Wagoneer  days earlier and left it? You think thats yet another coincidence?gtThose vehicles had been sitting there much longer than the  years he had been out of prison.Is that not also an assumption?,MakingaMurderer,df3vhlj,7,t5_3b2cn
11222033,0,t1_df3mrlh,Just my  cents.  The rav being there still bothers me.  I worked in a yard like this in the past and cars were crushed all the time.  No one thought anything at all about the crusher running or someone using it.  If SA wasnt worried about his family seeing it parked there while he was inside raping her or parked outside his garage while he shot and killed her or moving it from his house to the back of the lot why would he be afraid to crush it?  Its simple quick.  Trying to think like someone who wants to hide a murder its the biggest and most obvious piece of evidence to get rid of.  It seems backwards that he would spend the time needed to completely erase all of THs DNA evidence from the bedroom and garage as if someone would be knocking on the door at any moment and just leave the rav.  ,MakingaMurderer,df404y1,17,t5_3b2cn

His initial denials drove him to lie about everything in Crivitz then after Kaylas letter BD struggles to explain things without incriminating himself too much when this fails he tries his best to tell the truth but his memory is weak in places then his family pressures him to recant everything and he goes back to lying then MoK does his voodoo and BD will say anything to get out of prison then he clams up again and goes back to lying and finally in court BD tries the I dont know defense. And now that BD is in prison for good he has ZERO reason to tell the truth. ,MakingaMurderer,df8t5wo,-3,t5_3b2cn

11338380,0,t1_dfd82td,Thank you for the great response  I think if LE did have anything to do with planting any evidence it wouldve been done in a much more professional manner. As you said it doesnt make sense they would plant such a minimal amount of evidence and so Ive always been very skeptical of LE planting evidence. Bizarrely enough I find it more likely that an outside party friend or family member of SA would be responsible for such an amateur frame job however I still believe the most likely scenario given all the evidence is that SA killed TH. gtI think it is also important to remember that LE did not test every surface in the garage or trailer. The majority of what they did test is listed in CASO.I didnt know they didnt test all the surfaces in SAs trailergarage however I also cant give an accurate guess as to whether that often happens in homicide investigations. I imagine it is difficult to test every surface inside a property so do they choose a place that has visual cuesblood stains etc. and conduct the tests only in that area? Seems strange they wouldnt test every surface in the place however maybe it is far more difficult to do such extensive testing than Im making it out to be.gtWe cant even say with any degree of confidence what actually happened in the trailer.I totally agree and this is why I decided to write the OP. I have been a member of this subreddit for a while and Ive seen many people question how she couldve been shot in the garage both guilters and truthers however I would be very interested in hearing some theories on where she couldve been shot if not the garage and then how one bullet with her DNA wound up in there. It seems to me there is one or more important missing links that would explain the lack of THs DNA and while I still firmly believe based on the evidence that SA was responsible for her death these questions are whatre keeping me only juston the fence.gt...How could the police possibly have orchestrated that? They couldnt have. I think the only explanation for this crime is that either SA committed the murder or a series of extremely coincidental and unfortunate events somehow indicated SA was the culprit when he wasnt. Considering the slim odds of the latter being true the circumstantial evidence serves as more than circumstantial and definitely provides us with a somewhat clear yet incomplete picture of what happened. One question I havent heard answered is why many of the experts in the case indicated TH had been shot multiple times in the head and body and yet there was no question as to why there was only one bullet casing found in the garage. Do you have an answer?Thanks for the links and the informative answer!,MakingaMurderer,dfh6oy5,2,t5_3b2cn
11477814,0,t3_63rb6f,i listened to the book she wrote on the topic. lol it was long. i decided against watching the netflix show cause i was worn out on the story. But i am curious to see how they make it seem plausible that she could have done it. The book i guess obviously since she wrote it is not about the guilt vs innocence thing. It is mostly about how she was screwed by horrible police work in a foreign country. Not sure if Netflix has as their centerpiece as well or not.But even going back to look at the facts and other articles online its amazing to me that there are some people who actually think she is guilty of the murder.,MakingaMurderer,dfx08l3,1,t5_3b2cn

11525176,0,t1_dg2det4,Actually Guilt or Innocence comes with whether or not you believe the actual evidence presented by the Prosecution and Defense.  The jury should not base their decision on anything other than that information.eta  gtwhat further is meant by not to search for doubt?I take this to mean that there should be no speculation when you are making your decision.  Take the evidence as presented by the witnesses and whether or not you believe the information presented is enough to convict.  Dont consider evidence not presented at trial.,MakingaMurderer,dg2dpqj,7,t5_3b2cn
