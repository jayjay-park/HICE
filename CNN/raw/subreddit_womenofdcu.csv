3403158,0,t1_cpg3w98,TLDR DC doesnt have enough female lead titles. The ones that are dont represent girl power. Marvel is putting out female lead hit books and are doing great. Joker Variant Cover with Batgirl was offensive and will make it harder for female fans to get into the medium. Its a lot of the same stuff weve been seeing around the comicbook subreddits lately. ,womenofdcu,cpg6ory,4,t5_2tycs
