7507803,0,t1_d2vje9d,I understand your reasons from an in game perspective but in this case meta overrules any in game decisions regarding Ireland at least as far as RMTK is concerned.     Looking at the EU were in a dilemma on how to proceed as there is now a conflict between the canons.    In addition theres the question of in which category rMhOir currently falls    . Nonmodels and subreddits pretending or unsuccessfully trying to be a model Finland Russia Ireland Taiwan.   . Models not yet or no longer part of the Model World New Zealand France Singapore   . Models that are part of the Model World Britain Netherlands etc.      I would argue MhOir should fall under category  as they need more time to prove themselves as was the case for Riksdagen and RMTK more almost a year ago.,MBBCNews,d2vlkrn,2,t5_3d6as
