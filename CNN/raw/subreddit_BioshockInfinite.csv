79727,0,t3_1utizv,As you say youve seen Burial at Sea episode . There will be a Burial at Sea episode  in a few months so theres that.Now as for a full game Im sure there will be another Bioshock title. This one did really really well so I think thats probably a guarantee. I dont think it will feature Columbia. It may involve Elizabeth in some way as she does seem to be a character they dont want to just through away. But like I said I think Columbia is finished. Heck they already went back to Rapture in Burial at Sea.,BioshockInfinite,ceni7n4,5,t5_2t188

362691,0,t3_1y6t6x,I played through the  version first before the PC one and it wasnt bad at all.  The game still looks and runs fine compared to the PC version.I mean yeah there is a difference in quality no doubt but it was still quite an amazing looking game on the .  So dont worry about it.,BioshockInfinite,cficx8v,3,t5_2t188

627370,0,t1_cgbkhit,It could be any Booker actually youre right. But the key is that no Booker accepted the baptism meaning whichever Booker is with Anna in the credits will remain unaffected by Comstock. ,BioshockInfinite,cgbl00b,1,t5_2t188

678899,0,t1_cghfa6s,Right?  This one felt so vengeful and cold in part  and just this lost version in part .  I know an argument can be made for it being the original at least for part  but I just didnt feel that way.  I thin they wrote this in a way so that many interpretations could be made from it just like for the main story of Infinite.  It was merely a perpetuation of the idea of variations on a theme.  And the purpose of the DLC wasnt for closure for two characters from Infinite but to tie the whole franchise together Infinite to Bioshock .  That was my view of it.  It was still great and I loved it though.,BioshockInfinite,cghfwa4,1,t5_2t188
748533,0,t1_cgp548t,I see. Well it would be very interesting to see how a new team  director interprets rapture or Columbia. If a new game is made of course. ,BioshockInfinite,cgpd4yj,1,t5_2t188

2946881,0,t3_2tv7i6,I think people like her first of all because shes a major female character in a video game but also because of how she changes.She starts off very childish and naive with her only goal being to see Paris. However throughout the story she changes with her goal shifting towards ending the cycle between her Booker and Comstock. She must have realized the connections and the infinite loop with her understanding of quantum physics.,BioshockInfinite,co32op8,1,t5_2t188
3173521,0,t3_2wex4p,Ill assume the since you enjoyed Infinite youll probably enjoy games with good stories. I recommend The Last of Us Final Fantasy which one really depends. X is my personal favorite and would probably be a good starter RPG since youre new to video games Dragon Age Origins is a bit more RPGy but has great characters.Dont expect an epic minddestroying twist like in Bioshock from these though. ,BioshockInfinite,coqxn5o,1,t5_2t188
3452694,0,t3_2zqxuk,Columbia was a city known to be better than the colonies so why would they allow someone from the sodom below to enter their city with guns blazing? Seems it was a tactic to keep the city safe.And to scare the shit out of Booker.,BioshockInfinite,cplu18o,5,t5_2t188
