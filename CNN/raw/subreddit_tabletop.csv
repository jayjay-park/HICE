Has their success influenced yall at all in regards to offering the rules for free? Also in regards to the game is it possible to get a quick breakdown on game flow? or how a turn goes? ,tabletop,cejjffc,2,t5_2qs33

127246,0,t3_1vjjgq,Roll is a great tool to use to play any tabletop game.  Think of it as a whiteboard and video conference utility.  It does a lot more but Im sure youll figure out the more detailed bits as you go.  Starting with it as a white boardconference call is great.One of you will create a campaign and the other will join.  Whichever one of you creates it will be the GM Game Master.  That person will have more options on the Roll ingame menu than the other person the player.From there you can play any game you like.  Im old school so my recommendations probably wouldnt fit for your needs Dungeon World is very popular and would fit your needs as a fantasy game but Ive honestly never played it  other people would be able to give you better advice about which game system to try.,tabletop,cesx6p2,1,t5_2qs33

10390269,0,t3_5osrgy,For me e is vastly more enjoyable than Pathfinder but there are of course those who feel otherwise. Though objectively speaking I feel like it would be pretty hard to claim Pathfinder is a better system for a new GM to dive into.Basically Pathfinder involves a lot more of players figuring how how to add as many little bonuses to their rolls via intricate mechanics and character builds. Its the sort of game that rewards the players for spending hours pouring over character options and figuring out a combination of features thatll make them more powerful than your average character.e on the other hand has comparatively streamlined mechanics and has less overwhelming character options. Or alternatively put e has more limited character options. For me this is a welcome tradeoff.,tabletop,dclsw9d,7,t5_2qs33

Magic is divided into thematic spheres and each sphere is a base ability with several advanced abilities you can pick from. There are additional rules for picking up drawbacks or weaknesses to your magic in exchange for more versatility in your abilities. You can make basically any kind of spellcaster you want and it works just fine alongside normal Pathfinder magic rules in the same way psionics does.,tabletop,ddf19ul,2,t5_2qs33

11229528,0,t3_609va2,A variety of scenarios would potentially be a long term interest but if I can start with  battle scenario for example and then purchase others after Ive played that one to death then Id be alright with that.I suppose me originally stating I wanted a  term buy was wrong and that Id like to have a complete game in  purchase with the potential to expand later on if I feel the need.Battle strategy is the priority commanding infantry cavalry and potentially siege units depending on the scenario in a realistic way taking terrain and whatnot into account to produce realistic outcomes is the main goal.But if this is set into a greater war scenario where we move our armies a map before we meet them in battle then that would really be the icing on the cake.,tabletop,df4uop6,1,t5_2qs33
