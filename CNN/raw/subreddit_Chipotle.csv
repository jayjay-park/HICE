They wanna work with someone they like thats what Chipotles all about when it comes to working. Dont get me wrong youll probably work with one or two people that you do not care for but thats mostly not the case. Having Chipotle as a first job is gonna be a little hard but sweet for you. It is my second job and its pretty damn cool. I say its gonna be hard because sometimes they have shitty hours and sometimes they arent slow so that means that sometimes youll have to give over  to do your honest best. I wish you luck! Oh yeah one of the cooler things you can do with a job at Chipotle is that you can easily move up as long as youre good at what you do and know your stuff! Chipotle can easily turn into a career!

7043983,0,t3_4c0bpo,Your prep sheet is based on sales. So for ! of the day means that we should have x items for  of the sales you make that day whatever your projections are. So in turn for  that is  of your sales that day which is why tortilla and salsa MUST do reprep as these items arent meant to last that long for freshness. So lets say youre projected for . For a normal  day you will have enough lettuce diced onions etc. based on ERS projections and the correct portions yieldage etc. But once you hit  in sales you WILL run out of mild green guac etc. So in a way yes its already calculated you just have to know what percentage of your projected sales that is.As for your situation like luigi said bring them up in a manager meeting. And make that manager meeting mandatory and make it happen no matter what  no excuses. The sooner the better. Being that your GM is gone hit your area manager up and explain the situation. The thing is no one is ever not subject to having honest conversations. So you need to pull your SM and AP aside and have an HC with them about whats going on but considering that doesnt work you need to take the next best step  talk to your AM. Like you said if your GM was there itd be best to talk to him but with him gone for now your AM is your next best bet because it seems like your AP and SM are retards no offense intended. With DPTs coming back next month as well the whole crew at your store will definitely see the things being fucked up one in particular being that your crew andor MITs arent being set up for success. Thats something your AM will see just talking to you. ,Chipotle,d1esk2h,2,t5_2r04h
