905700,0,t3_24h3r9,I understand why they tiered them up more money yo but it really defeats the concept of pay what you want. Perhaps I dont consider those games to be worth . Perhaps I only want the top tier one and all the others can go to hell as is often the case with these bundles  one or two good titles the rest are fillers that will never be played.What makes me sad is that despite the Linux users only having one or two titles available for them they still paid more than average.,Gamebundles,ch78f7z,3,t5_2t809

1991254,0,t3_2hga64, is a great BUY and worth it if your into those types of games.  The  package is ok deal if you really want those  games which are pretty good.  LLTQueen has been on sale for . and other Yawhg was  sale good but short would expect to see that go cheaper in future for . as well.Valdis  tier was on sale for . after xmas last yr is good but I would expect it to go on sale again in near future.  So I think it should have been included in the  tier.   game should have been something more amazing!,Gamebundles,ckt5a4n,3,t5_2t809
2090128,0,t1_cl51jda,You can also use steam family sharing function I am not sure if it will work for that game but it works for a lot of them. So you can make an account place the game in its library then set  friends to be able to use it  note though that only one person can use it at any time.,Gamebundles,cl5i29j,2,t5_2t809

6095393,0,t1_cyigm2i,I already have Talos so Im going to give that to a friend who has it on his wishlist... But the other games I have never heard of save for Fandango and they dont sound particularly interesting.  Im sure theyre great games but its going to be a while before I play them.  As far as value yes the bundles are always a good money deal but at the same time Youre paying for maybe a set of good games that youll enjoy vs buying something you know youre going to enjoy. Its like pleasant surprise vs pleasant purchase.,Gamebundles,cyihewz,1,t5_2t809

I remember spending  on Fallout  playing it for a couple hours and just deciding I didnt like it. I wouldve liked to win one of the COD titles or something but oh well.
