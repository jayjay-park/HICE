102848,0,t3_1v7r6f,There is a product called micro sol that you may want to look into. That and white vinegar helps a decal look more like its painted on. I believe Micro Sol is sort of a better adhesive and white vinegar will sort of melt the decal a bit to conform to raised and engraved detail grid lines and bolts in your case. Then seal it because the decals are now MORE delicate with a gloss coat and then a matte varnish coat. This also gets rid of the silvering effect that your set decals are showing as well.All these steps may sound intimidating to a beginner modeler but believe me its an extra step worth taking.,modelmakers,ceq52iw,1,t5_2sf9u

267687,0,t3_1x4yjc,I worked for many years with the same cutters youve got. I was too lazy to buy a proper pair of flush cutters. What yours will do is you will cut a part from the sprue then spend some times with an exacto blade removing the extra bits of plastic. This is not so bad since you have to clean your parts anyway no matter the type of cutters youre using. The only difference is that with flush cutters theres a lot less cleaning involved and it goes much faster.Youre all set with your kit and the tools you have for a first build. If you like it and youve had fun then consider better tools.Building in  is cool because the build time is very very short. You can get your vehicle all built in less than an hour if youre fast and if youve got a clean kit. To me they get frustrating because they lack detail and the parts are ALL very small and fragile however theyre very fun for a first build since they go very fast! Fast to assemble fast to paint and fast to weather!Again if youve had fun with your  kit try a . Itll be fun and itll look more realistic however itll take much more time to complete!Being patient is one requirement for model building. You can focus on building now but keep the painting in mind through your build. Look for reference pictures and go the easiest path since youre getting back into the hobby. Simple camo or even one tone is easy and looks cool anyway. Keep in mind this isnt your last kit ever you can always buy an other one and try something new!What I usually do is try one or two new techniques for each builds.Washing your kit depends on how youll finish it. A good primer plus an airbrush paint means you dont absolutely need to wash it unless you let it gather dust before paint.If youre going with paintbrushes make sure its primed anyway.Your goal should be to always have fun. If its no fun theres no point in doing it.,modelmakers,cf8i7x4,3,t5_2sf9u

793243,0,t3_2380yh,There is a good guide in the subs FAQ sticky. In fact the first section is about airbrushing.You will need three components  the airbrush itself an airbrush hose that fits the airbrush and an air compressor. There are many compressors available it would be best to use a site like amazon to do some research. ,modelmakers,cgug1kj,2,t5_2sf9u
805621,0,t1_cgvk6wr,First dont remove all the parts from the sprue at once remove them as you need them. Otherwise youll probably lose tiny parts or mix them up. But definitely dry fit before gluing yes. I have never sanded primer but that might just be me... You should probably rinse it and let it dry before priming it to get skin oils and stuff off the surface. My decal process is also more like. Paint airbrushing base coat camo if required.. Paint details tools external stuff mostly brushpainting. Spot glosscoat where the decals will go. Decals. Glosscoat the whole thing. Washesweathering any final detail painting this is where I usually fix mistakes Ive missed along the way. Final sealer coat matte or gloss depending on the vehicle. Take pictures post to rmodelmakers I mostly just dont want to get too much gloss on things since itll obscure detail like panel lines if you arent careful. But yeah in general youve got it. Every build has the potential to be slightly different so be aware of that too. Plan ahead and be aware of how different layers and stuff will interact and you shouldnt run into any major problems. ,modelmakers,cgvuptv,1,t5_2sf9u

923967,0,t3_24hod4,I went through quite a struggle trying to get Vallejo paint to spray properly. I tried every possible combination I could think of to get it to run properly in an airbrush. It took a while but I finally found a process that works great.. Buy a good air brush. Cheap Chinese airbrushes like Master Airbrush have  a lot of sharp corners in the design where clots can form. They also have a fairly small tip and dont open wide enough so you cant clear the gun effectively if you do get a clot. I switched to a Paasche Talon and its like night and day.. Vallejo airbrush cleaner is the only thinning medium that gives me the results I want with Vallejo paint. Ive tried water Windex Vallejo thinner alcoholthat was fun and none of them give results like the airbrush cleaner. No clots no tip build up.. Make sure you get it thin enough. Im sure youve all heard the skim milk comparison. It really takes less paint than you think.Edit One more thing I forgot. Dont put the paint in first. If you do some of it will seep down around your needle and no matter how well you mix you will be spraying some unthinned paint. Put a bit of your thinning medium in first and give it a little spray to fill the channel and coat the needle and tip. Then add paint mix and thin to desired consistency. ,modelmakers,ch9b6rp,2,t5_2sf9u

1467219,0,t3_2axl1i,That little Hetzer the Jagdpanzer t should be a nice clean build. Any of the lessexpensive Tamiya kits the under  ones will probably also be nice and fit together well. Theyre older kits and may be lacking some detail but theyre generally welldesigned and quite nice. Larger andor newer Tamiya kits are also generally quite good but may be more expensive for starting out. Tamiyas Tiger should also be good but it sure has a lot of wheels. The M is also cool but since it has an open top it will include a lot of interior detail which might get kind of tedious for your first armor build. Academys Hetzer will I believe include linkandlength tracks rather than flexible vinyl or rubber tracks which can be a bit easier to paint and look nicer than most flexible tracks. They can also be a bit tedious to piece together and require patience and tiny bits of glue but Ive build one of their Hetzers and I though it went together really well.

Building it was one hell of an experience but I quite enjoyed it. Would definitely like to get another someday.Things of note Yes yes theres some things I havent installed. This is intentional. PE is a bitch for me to work with right now I still lack the supplies to properly deal with the stuff. Im also still picking up paint colors notably Im lacking a good brush version of the dark green I rattlecanned it in. The tracks are...blah honestly. I like vinyl tracks and I hate these things. Im getting a bunch of Friuls for my whole stash over the next couple months so Ill be picking up two sets of ATLI have a late  T from Tamiya as well. No plans to RC this bad boy. I put way too much effort into the interior to tear it apart and stuff RC guts in there. Especially when I can grab a Tamiya T for half the price on Amazon or eBay. The workable suspension is amazeballs and at the same time infuriating. So many tiny parts. The antenna atop the turret is infuriating. I can NOT get that bastard to stay on for hte life of me. Even the breeze from my window AC unit on the other side of the room has it wilting and eventually coming off. Probably gonna have to drill out the hole large enough to give it a socket to sit in rather than just gluing it on as the instructions dictate.Overall I loved building it.

1750404,0,t3_2ehn0a,Looks pretty good to me.  I know it doesnt help without an airbrush but one of many less publicised uses for an airbrush is recovering from situations like this.  You can go back over the model with a thinneddown version of the original colour and unwash your model.  With practice and a good airbrush you can paint a line around mm wide giving great precision.I regularly end up with botched weathering that I have to go over in this way.Another suggestion is to try a wash made from oil paint and turpenoid or quality turpentine. You can manipulate these for hours even come back the next day with a slightly turpsmoistened tissue or cotton tip and remove any excess or overdone effect.,modelmakers,cjzsp6r,3,t5_2sf9u

The dollar store is a modellers best friend besides model stores For example it has wooden or plastic boxes that with little modifying make great stands. My ds is a dollar store jewelry box turned upside down and painted. Lots of dollar store items can be modified to help with a build. If you light the model then use strip leds or something small. There is very little space to work with in the model. I learned that the hard way. Lots of other tips but none come to mind.

2298253,0,t3_2lk5v1,Regarding the negative comments here about muck around modelmaking and the simplicity of the buildsGranted its a different target audience than most of us here who do historical modelling but I do believe that some of us can take something from it. The same way a simple  airfix build can be used as a short stress relief between complex projects a fantasy build or game miniature paint offers a break from the usual techniques and processes and in my opinion can really refresh the mind.I guess what Im trying to say is to try to keep an open mind and see that the other variations of modelmaking have obviously merits of their own. Whether these merits appeal to you in particular Im not trying to tell you. To some a good build has more appeal than the paintjob and to others viceverse.Personally I partake in historical scifi tabletop and resin garage kit.,modelmakers,clvs38m,3,t5_2sf9u
2313659,0,t3_2ls2ko,Yes you can prime entire sprues but you might be better served completing parts of the model and then priming because otherwise youll have to scrape off the primer at the areas where you want glue joints.

Painting is  of the fun in armour modelling for me  you can really tell a story through a model when you get confident with your finishing skills.For your first model Id say keep it pretty simple  use quality primer and basecoat sprays like Tamiya.

You cut out with scissors or a knife around whichever decal another more common name for transfers youre going to put on and leave it in water for a little while  seconds and then slide transfer it onto the position you need it to be in. Something soft to slide it off without ripping it would be useful. You paint Ti model before doing this.I hope I described that right And sometimes leaving the pieces in warm water for a while removes a top layer of plastic from the pieces which allows for easier glueing and for the paint to stay on the surface easier.,modelmakers,crnglh1,3,t5_2sf9u

4827484,0,t1_cu30u8i,Modeling is a niche hobby. Like anything else in a similar vein once you get out of the entrylevel offerings you need to look into specialized places. If youre a beginner Airfix has a great line of  WW planes. Theyre very inexpensive easy to put together and the quality is superb. Its all on new machinery too. Tamiya Trumpeter Airfix Hasegawa Hobbyboss most of the brands talked about in this sub are pretty good. Everyone has their bad kits though. Ive had decent kits from Revell believe it or not their  Volkswagen Cabriolet I built for my mother a while back but thats a different quality than your standard whatsnormallyreferredtoasaRevellkit. A lot of times its not the brand outright that makes bad kits its the age of the tooling used to make them. Your Michaels Revell plane kits are made on tooling from the s at least and they just keep getting rereleased. Not only is the tooling older more primitive and well old but it degrades over time from  years of molding and casting.With the discrepancy on different qualities of kits from that brand if youve been in the game long enough you can tell what models are likely to be those from looking at the box art. If its under  and is a Vietnamorearlier plane from Revell chances are its one of those.  What I normally do when looking for a kit is find my subject and what scale I want to build it in if its popular enough to come in multiple. Then I look to see who makes it and go off kit reviews yes people do this. A lot of people. Balance drawbacks and benefits you know the drill.,modelmakers,cu31loi,1,t5_2sf9u

4865989,0,t3_3hgd37,Ah ha you went for the fancy Panzer II. Looks like a nice kit.I would recommend that you assemble most things before painting and paint only a few things separately. Gluing over paint pretty much doesnt work either it doesnt stick because you need plasticonplastic contact for the cement to work or you damage the paint and have to repaint it anyway. You may also find that parts dont fit perfectly so you may need to sand or putty seams and joints and that will also take off the paint. Basically build as much as you can and then paint it or youll end up having to pretty much paint it twice... What I usually do is build the hull and stuff that goes on it leaving the wheels and tracks and turret off and painting those separately. I made a sort of tutorialbuild log thing of Tamiyas cheaper Panzer II kit    Ive found this to be for me the best way to make sure I can paint what needs to be painted without having to do weird things to get in behind the wheels after theyre attached.One thing other people do differently is to keep extra bits like shovels and things detached and paint those separately. I mostly dont because uh... I dont know why not but I dont. Mostly not wanting to lose the pieces I think. ,modelmakers,cu7w8mp,1,t5_2sf9u

Any shallow water bowl for soaking decals Some PVA white glue  if you are gluing transparent plastics Spruce cutters  get the smallest head possible cheaper at hardware stores Penknife or exacto knife  for trimming parts Sandpaper get the finest from any hardware store. To sand and make parts even Since you do planes they come with lots of decal so invest in a Microset or Mark Setter decal solutions Paint stuff I used Tamiya acrylics because they are easy to wash  Thinner to thin the acrylics use sparingly. I used those Isoprophyl   from pharmacies to save cost. This can be used to wash your brushes as well Set of brushes get them cheap from art stores  I only used  types the very thin fine ones a flat wide one and something in between I am not airbrushing so cant advise on that Paint trayspalettes. I used something metallic like these  but any one for art use will be fine as well. Some holders like these  to hold your small stuff while u paint or decal.

5167668,0,t1_cv8lqif,I have a couple suggestions.  . If you want to really chip the whitewash you need a hairspray layer in between your clear coat and the white paint.  Then with a brush and water it will chip instead of sort of smearing.  . I disagree with the other poster that you should brush whitewash.  Airbrushing works just fine.  However what you and I on my last build did was spray too even of a coat of whitewash.  To simulate whitewashs natural crap adhesion you should vary the opacity of the white over the model.  Create thicker whiter areas and thinner areas where the camo shows through.  Then use the hairspray and water technique above to chip those areas.. After youre done with the whitewash hit the vehicle with a wash of some sort. I found that an overall very thin brown wash really helped add depth to the most recent vehicle I did.  I took a tiny bit of burnt umber oils and thinned them very well then did a single thin wash over the whole vehicle.  That toned down the white while helping to highlight details.  Then I added a bit more paint to the wash and did a localized pinwash on the parts that needed more shadowy highlighting.

5260948,0,t1_cvixvv9,When he says enamel paints are hazardous it wont mean that youll die from spraying them. But theyre bad in the long run. First off if you plan on airbrushing youll see that its a lot more hazardous than brush painting. Mainly because you are putting the fumes straight into the air. Easy to breathe. And if you plan on doing this in a ventilated area... a lot you can actually cause some damage to your lungs. Nothing horrible like lung cancer even though technique you could get that. But things like some chronic coughs. Its happened to me when I was airbrushing enamels in my basements laundry room for the longest times as a kid. Acrylics are just nicer. Theyre more refined than they used to be. If youre coming back youre probably a lot more familiar with enamel and not so sure about acrylic. But acrylics are basically the modelers first paint. It dries faster theres more you can do with them more companies make them airbrush easier no fumes and easy clean up. ,modelmakers,cvk57jx,1,t5_2sf9u

5699555,0,t1_cx3kaz4,You can thin it with mineral spirits or turpentine or some similar paint thinner. Dont add a lot as its pretty hot and may melt the plastic if you get too heavy with it.

5930300,0,t3_3wkavx,I have seen worse but there are some points that can be improved.White is indeed a difficult colour to paint even without shading and highlighting. First step would be using a decent white primer i liked the Tamiya one. Then applying several coats of a good white colour properly thinned should do the trick. If you wish to start shading or if you simply require a white with a high amount of pigments then i suggest using Andreas White Colour set  if you like acrylics. This is of course by no means mandatory. Red is also a rather difficult colour to achieve but a flat red can be easily done by once again using several thin layers of a good red colour. Masking tape Tamiya or any other company which sells masking tape ofthe appropriate size will help you with getting cleaner edges between the colours i have the black white transition in mind here.The decals need more time and a good tutorial can be found here Once again the model is nothing to be ashamed of and your next models will certainly only get better.,modelmakers,cxwzrz7,4,t5_2sf9u

6006046,0,t1_cy6q9bd,Yup. F is roughly  x  and a B is   x . So on a table next to each other the B will have a wider wing span while the F is longer. But to my eye they are similar in size due to the delta shape of the F wings and the length of fuselage. ,modelmakers,cy6x91l,1,t5_2sf9u
6021978,0,t1_cy8zw1h,I use dish soap since a lot of them are made for greaseoil and supersafe.  Some people use auto degreaser or Simple Green.  Use warm water let it soak a few hours or overnight then scrub with cheap toothbrush and rinse.  Dont let the water get too hot since it can warp resin.  Also you may want an outdoor area or vented bathroom where you can let the parts air out when you first open it prob not a big deal with small part but when you get bigger sets.Also resin dust can cause respritory issues in the long term so sand in wellventilated areas try to wetsand to reduce dust and get a dust maskrespirator if you have one for airbrushing use it.,modelmakers,cy906ca,2,t5_2sf9u

I really never use white grey or sand as they look too light when scaled down.I bought a set of MIGs  years ago and still am using them.  They go a lot farther than you think.  I recommend the browns because you can make so many dirt shades then lightendarken them as needed.  I also use the MIG fixer because you can actually handle it to a degree afterwards. Normal thinner will set the pigments but they will fall off if you touchbrush them.I have black but I think its kind of a waste I feel a quick shot of black with the airbrush looks better.,modelmakers,cyqubc1,2,t5_2sf9u

6541417,0,t3_456il4,gtHello. I recently purchased a new airbrush and am eager to try it out. I have not tried it out though because I am not sure how much to thin my pain. I avoided painting so as to not damage my airbrush with an improper thinning ratio. No need to worry just flush some thinner in the airbrush and then disassemble and clean it. gt  What thinning ratio andor consistencyviscosity and thinning product can I use to airbrush Testors enamel paints?I never sprayed enamels but I know for sure that enamel thinner can damage the orings. What kind of airbrush do you have? Some airbrushes have enamel resistant seals. gt  Are there any alternatives to big brand products? The reason i mention that is because i live in a place that does not have many hobby shops close by. The nearest is probobly  kilometers away.Probably but I would not put a generic acrylic paint or some decoupage paint in my airbrush. gt  What products and procedures should i use to ensure that my airbrush works properly and has a long life span?Clean it after ever use including the needle the channel under the cup and the dusetip. Disassemble the trigger assembly every now and then. Do not use any oillubrificant. I prefer to use some wrapped kitchen paper soaked in thinner to clean the parts but there are some high quality brushes on the market generically called airbrush brushes that can help you to clean recessed areas ,modelmakers,czvxoqz,2,t5_2sf9u

6779733,0,t3_48jzjg,I started with k and then shifted to Cars then to  Ships to we kinda have the same roots.  For your first point you want to make it look good.  It really depends how far you want to take it you can make it OOB or you can buy the Photoetch parts to add more details or go even further and scratch build parts to add even more details.  Photoetch might cost as much as the kit so youll have to make that choice.  I dont want new ship builders to be discouraged with working with photoetch but it will be a frustrating experience and you will screw things up if you dont think carefully and plan a head but this hobby is all about learning and making the next kit better than the last.  Another option is to buy the wooded deck sticker but again money.For you second point Ive build the  Yamato and things are tiny like most parts are the size of K grenades  part are more likely the sizes of space marine heads I guess.  The ship is gonna be long my  Yamato is like . rhinos long so  would be like  lots of flat surfaces so whatever you do with k flat surfaces you do it here.  In terms of details there is gonna be stuff like power boxes ridges doors windows rivets on the sides and they can all be taken care of with drybrushing and washes. No need for extreme highlighting or blending or anything fancy. Build wise maybe even easier than k stuff ships parts all kinda stack on top of each other Yamato will just have crap ton of AA guns.You also mentioned Tamiyas Yamato Im not sure about  scale but for  scale Tamiya ship kits lack mold on details compared to other companies like Fujimi or Aoshima I think Fujimi provides the best mold on details and they usually have a Photoetch set for large ships check them out on various online stores before you make your purchase.TLDR  will have a lot of small parts the size of space marine heads Details will be molded on the sides a wash and drybrush should take care of them Fujimi might have better mold on details  optional Photoetch and wood deck Picking up the photoetch and wood deck will add a lot of details but it double the price and it has a learning curve.,modelmakers,d0krm5x,2,t5_2sf9u

For the meetings people bring in models to display or enter into that months contest.  Club business is discussed then there is time set aside to check out all the models and vote on which one will in in each category.  Then there is a presentation on some topic of interest related to history or modeling in general.I am not a particularly social person but I do feel like I am slowly getting to know a few of the guys there and as time goes on Im sure I will get to know more of them better.  Just getting to see everyone elses work is really cool and having other modelers see mine is exciting too.My advice is to go check it out.  Bring something if you have something to bring but if not just check out what everyone else has.

7726810,0,t1_d3k87lt,Thanks so much for the compliment! For metallics Ive tried everything but have found that decent quality acrylics are the best way to go. I hate dealing with handbrushing enamels and you can actually see on the left gauntlet theres weird flecks and imperfections which are tiny clumps of enamel I didnt bother removing. Wasnt happy with the finish went back to acrylics lol for this piece specifically the primary color I used was Golden Iridescent Bronze Fine which actually looks more gold or brass. Accent pieces were done IIRC with Liquitex Aged Bronze Golden Iridescent Bright Bronze Fine Citadel Mithril Silver and another coffee brown bronze which I cant remember the name of. I can double check andor snap a pic of them later.I thin ALL of my handbrushed paints with water or windshield fluid and a drop of dish liquid. Trust me the dish soap helps adjust the viscosity and helps paint adhere and cover SO much better. If Im doing washes for weathering like I did with this piece of which theres  or  layers some of it is washed out in the pics as the armor really does look quite dingy I add a matte medium to the wash. Specifically Liquitex Ultra Matte Medium or something like that. Michaels or A.C. Moore has had it for me. Its also important to remember that if you follow this technique DONT SEAL OVER THE WORK ONCE YOURE DONE. Creating the contrast between shining armor and dull grimy dirt is super important to the realistic finish.As far as handbrushing versus airbrushing? Any flat wide surface is airbrushed usually... the base was done in mottled greens and blues all airbrushed except for where the water is breaking. I LIGHTLY drybrushed some white over the details followed by an airbrushed misting of the transparent green I used on the water. Skin is ALWAYS airbrushed. You cant achieve mottled skintones like the ones here without it. Or more specifically Im not able to lol David Fished recently handpainted a Nosferatu piece that looks completely lifelike... but then thats David Fisher lolAs for the drool I touched on that in a previous comment. Mostly Golden gel mediums and Gloss Polymer Emulsions or whatever. For the predators mouth I used my old standby of Testors enamel glosscoat. Ive tried to replace it again and again and just havent been able to.The water and the predaliens head was sprayed with heavy HEAVY coats of Future Floor Polish but as the pics will attest to the coats were too heavy and over the years it cracked. It doesnt show up in person only under the bright photography lighting. Its irritating but fuck it. Its finished lolThe quills are custom to the piece and I generally add them to my predator kits for added detail and because in the films theyre covered in them. The holes were all predrilled during the sandingseam stage prior to painting. Theyre just porcupine quills I snipped the tips off of. After getting frustrated with super glue I used Golden Matte Polymer Emulsion might be getting the name wrong to just dip the end in then set it into the predrilled hole. Theyve got a faint brown color to them though so I went over them with the Liquitex Paynes Gray I used for the dark spotspatterning I used elsewhere on the pred.Hope that answered all of your questions!,modelmakers,d3khfry,2,t5_2sf9u

7734664,0,t3_4l8b5l,Welcome to the hobby and Reddit.For your first attempt it isnt bad. I like what youre doing trying LEDs. Some things to consider Thin your paints if you are using brushes. Dont try to cover it all in one coat. Multiple thin layers is the only way to go.If you are going to try to disassemble and light it consider painting the inside black. The glow from the light might bleed through the plastic and the exterior paint somewhat. If you decide you like the hobby investing in high quality paint brushes and later an airbrush will be things to consider. Like you Ive only recently gotten back into the hobby one year ago as an adult after building models as an adolescent in the early s. The kits are so much better they cost more too and there are so many great resources out there from youtube to reddit to just googling the kit. Its an amazing time to be a modeler. Stick around and dont be shy about asking questions.  ,modelmakers,d3ldk6y,5,t5_2sf9u
7741616,0,t3_4la8pa,I have exactly the same setup.The compressor is great. Terrific value for something that really only needs to shoot dry air out at a consistent pressure  which it does. Decent build quality fills the tank in good order and isnt too loud when it runs. Airflow is consistent and moisture trap does its job. Remember to undo the valve at the bottom of the tank every now and then to drain any water  if you dont the tank itself will start to corrode.Im reserving judgement on the Neo though. Mine has some seal issues around the nozzle that I cant resolve and Im not sure I get the best out of it it tends to spatter. Perhaps its just my abilities! Your mileage may vary.

7979034,0,t3_4oh833,first thing I notice is that everything has been given purely the base coat and you went on from there. I notice you have sprayed on the colors so I assume you are using an airbrush. This is good news for your next trick to learn light and dark variations. Some people call it color modulation. The first principle of a model is that some areas can be highlighted to bring out the depth of the model or some parts. Using lighter shades of the colors of the camouflage on certain parts will bring them out sort of stick them out better. Color modulation goes even further where you would place gradients on certain panels and create stark contrasts between separate pieces of the tank. You can also alter some of the shades of the base colors using filters to put emphasis or break the surface. In general I believe your base color is a tad to dark to start with keep in mind that putting filters and washes on your colors will darken them eventually. Also a model can quickly look too dark because it is tiny using a slightly lighter color than the actual counterpart will eventually give you a great result.look up color modulation youtube and try it out. Good luck!,modelmakers,d4cx2ta,2,t5_2sf9u

Some things like the headlights may not print well but those things can probably be fixed a bit with photoetch and scratch building. With that being said D printing using the above materiel is still rather expensive cm  and easily surpasses the cost of even a  injection molded kit. If its a model no one makes D printing makes a lot of sense but if its something TammiyaTrumpeterDragonEduardwhatever makes youre probably better off sticking to those options.

I use hunks of sprue for stirring since they are tough enough to do the job.It also seems to me that many of the Humbrol gloss paints take a long time to dry overnight or even longer and frequently need a second coat.For all that though Humbrol is pretty much my goto brand for paint.,modelmakers,d4x9juh,1,t5_2sf9u

I should have those tomorrow and I will take more pictures of the finished productI also finished up the quick little side project V that goes with the Tempest.  No need to weather or spend too much time on the camo for a oneshot cruise missile right? My plan was to pivot back to Eduards new BFG that I started but I realized that I am running out of time to participate in the NMF groupbuild.  So I busted out Eduards boxing of Hasegawas F Sabre I decided to display it in flight thinking that closing up the cockpit and the wheel wells would save me some time.  The problem is that displaying it in flight will require that I fix some ejector pin marks in the intake and exhaust trunks which will take time. And that time spent detailing the cockpit and wheel wells has probably been offset by the time it took to make the pilot Painting figures is something I have always avoided so my skills are lacking. I am improving but not highly skilled.The bottom line is that I probably waited too long to get started on my groupbuild project and there are already some stunning finished models btw.

8519462,0,t3_4wekf1,. Pressure looks too high I see overspray along the soft edges of that camo. . Masking freehand camo only works when as uResinseer says lower pressures and lower paint flow. You might want to thin the paint a tiny bit more. . Work in dots of paint if you want to freehand. Low pressurelow flow also allows you to either  paint in clean lines at small diameters or  dots of paint can be tediously built up to do the same but just more slowly. . Hold your brush a bit closer perhaps. But being able to do so means also being able to operate at low pressure or youll basically blast the paint everywhere and create overspray effects like you see in your example. . As for the model either fix the edges by widening the lines by a hair to cover the overspray or respray the areas with overspray to clean it up. ,modelmakers,d66hrw2,2,t5_2sf9u

8755931,0,t3_5005u5,Hello! The first thing that you will need is an airbrush. There are three main brands to choose from Badger Iwata and Paasche each with several types of airbrushes offered.When choosing your airbush choose a dual action one. Dual action means that the trigger which is usually on top can control the airflow and paintflow. Also you need to consider how the airbrush holds the paint. There are two ways for this. The first is gravity feed where the paint is put into a cup on top and gravity draws it into the spray. The second is siphon feed where the paint is put into a seperate container and is siphoned off into the spray. I reccomend gravity feed it is easier to use and is more practical for beginners.I personally use an Iwata HPCS but that is a bit out of your price range. Iwata is very good and their Neo series is designed for beginners and are more affordable.Your compressor should be good so long as it can spray at a constant pressure and at a low pressure  psi. The fittings are no issue the airbrush manufacturers make converters.With respiratory protection just make sure that your mask can filter out organic vapors and P particles.Finally most paints need to be thinned except for Vallejos model air series. Clean your airbush regularly this is vital. Occasionally take it all apart and clean each peace individually. Hope this helps!,modelmakers,d705e8w,4,t5_2sf9u

Boom.As far as easy and cheap I know what college life is kits go look into Zvezdas productions T Tiger SU Trumpeter lots of German armor Challengers Merkavas Abrams also a nice line of Ts KVs and Ts or if youre willing to order online Smodel kits. Two easy build vehicles for the price of one! Plus I advise you to get Mr Hobby or Tamiya acrylic paints you can clean your brushes get two of these a mm. inch wide one and the smallest one you can find for detailing with cheap alcohol like discount brand vodka and they cover the plastic very well. I dont know what the prices are in the USA I suppose youre from there so Ill base myself on the French prices. Lets say we base ourselves on Trumpeters TB. The model itself will cost  to  glue is . the brushes can be found for . a pop and theyre decent and you will need Russian green gun metaldark steel and brown at . each. Or for example grey steel and brown for a German Panzer Thats at the highest estimation  for a complete starter pack with a model and the basic tools. I suppose that you have in the dorm some kind of sharp blade and if possible a small file the kind girls use for their nails. If you dont get some its cheap. Now youre good to go!Plus you can use the steel and brown paints for basic weathering. Put some steel paint on your brush begin drying the brush on a piece of cloth when its almost dry run the brushes on the edges of your vehicle. Then clean the brush take brown paint same process you just drybrush the tracks roadwheels and everything close to them. And you have a finished weathered model!,modelmakers,d7p2p54,3,t5_2sf9u

The two fuselage haves have an awful horrid step between the two halves that required an absolute ton of body work. Some parts have really weak attachment points such as the two rear landing struts and the bay doors which have next to no surface area connected to the rest of the model. I dont know if I messed something up or what but when applying the band on the fuselage it felt like either it was too big or the rest of the model was shrunk I couldnt fit both that AND the stars in position without overlap I know the stars were correct since theyre separated into two pieces to allow for open flaps.

It avoids the additional work of doing the black base color then spraying hundreds of dots of the actual ship color then post shading you were probably going to do anyway. My kilo sub I posted a week or two ago in essence did that. Granted the base color is black but what I did for the upper hull was use NATO black to build in some fading then go over it with lightened colors to post shade it to create the fading effect. I used very dark grays at strategically sprayed intervals to create the variations. It was a lot less work than pure black basing as the technique is generally described. ,modelmakers,d9ctmdj,2,t5_2sf9u

This kits pretty new has got a decent level of detail standard more than every other kit of theirs Ive built but its still a bit simple.Great kit but its also ridiculously expensive and comes with bugger all extras. The bikes nice the figures are good quality the choice of fixed plastic or vinyl tracks is decent I guess give singlelink plastic please but its still not worth the AUD I paid for it which is almost twice as much as most of their other kits.,modelmakers,db7na2m,1,t5_2sf9u

9998252,0,t1_dbasnm0,Not usually and depends on the manufacturer. You should look up the instructions. Some companies will list ALL the paints needed to build ALL listed color schemes provided in the box even though you can only select one. Others will leave out some colors and tell you which major colors you need to buy. Revell Germany occasionally does this. Tamiyas US website will also list ALL colors for ALL paint schemes of a given aircraft even though  you can only paint one version  include duplicates of the sprays and bottled paints of the same color. For airplanes often half the colors will be used for only very minor parts seat belts instrument panels padding on the ejection seat the uniforms of any crew figures. Airfix is particularly guilty of this. ,modelmakers,dbasu6c,2,t5_2sf9u

There are stronger ones out there Solvaset would probably be the one id recommend first its stronger but still fairly safe.  I also have an old bottle of Polly S that is absolutely nuclear that Ive been hoarding for difficult decals.  I think Model Masters  is the same stuff but I havent tried it.  As long as you dont clearcoat you can still come back with stronger solutions days later and get it to lay down.

They are a little more expensive than tamiya but their engineeringfit is even better you usually get some very nice PE components excellent instructions and s beautiful kit out of it. Part counts run reasonably high often because of tracks.Takom recent kits atleast are fantastic. They do lots of interesting subjects that others dont cover much such as field guns. Lots of pieces and lots of small pieces. Takom kits feel like they have brittle plastic than tamiya or meng and I sometimes break pieces. Instructions are prone to mislabelling but the kits are beautiful.Trumpeter again only referring to newer kits. Nice kits probably sit between tamiya and meng in terms of qualitypart countetc. Instructions can be very iffy. Notable for their large scale kits.Bandai only really make star wars and gundam kits but they are fantastic. As far as I know you can only get most of them with Japanese instructions but it barely matters since its all done with pictures anyway.Ryefield models extreme part counts lead to some wonderful looking but very long projects. Instructions are good and rarely for models updated instructions are available online if misprints are found. Their line is limited but what they have is quality.Dragon high part counts between meng and ryefield in the box but often not all are used they provide multiple options per model in one box.

The base plastic comes in molded colors for certain areas but the plastic sheen of the molds still gives these kits a toy appearance. You can somewhat remedy it by applying a matte top coat over everything.

Basically its a kit from some specific brands and style that maaayyyyybe could belong here if it wasnt viable to have a specialized sub but the only skill involved is following instructions and once the building is done theres nothing else involved kinda like doing paper models again each to his own and those are perfectly fine hobbies nor worse or better than plastic modelling. I dont think it can even be compared with PE kits as those end painted andor forming part of dioramas or builds representing accurate objects in scale which cant edit forgot the t be said of a metal earth tiger I for example.They should go to their sub as are a specific kind of kits that share a similarity distinctive enough a niche perhaps.

It wouldnt be hovering over the grass like that but you were repurposing the base for the photo so fair enough. . Dust is too uniform as if someone sprayed it with a coat of dust which also given where its sitting doesnt make a whole lot of sense. Theres grass everywhere. Where is this dust coming from? . Thin your paints. Along the front plates you can clearly see thickness in the paint indicating the paint has built up unevenly. . Spare track links have green paint on them. . Muffler...are those stains or camo? Check right side.. Chipping along the side skirts is too uniform particularly up top and along the sides they wouldnt wear the same way. . Chipping along the front of the turret is too uniform and far too heavy it looks like it goes all the way around the turret face. . Skirts are bent out of shape which to be fair some models depict as partially bent or damaged. ,modelmakers,de6py41,1,t5_2sf9u
10933550,0,t3_5vvy4l,Ive built Tamiya Ferrari f here it is  and here I picked it because  I think it is one of the most beautiful F cars ever built so it was super fun to do it  the colors are Red and black and some gunmetal greys so very easy to paint  it let me practice on something considered easy as a kit compared to Mclaren or Renaults. So to me it was a great way to start F builds and some day Ill do Mclaren and Renaults to compliment it so I have something similar to an Accolade Grand Prix Circuit PC game set up. As for techniques its like armor but backwards. You paint most things first and then you assemble. The body itself needs to be perfect so expect to buy some polishing compounds clearcoats learn how to layer them properly etc. But once done it will yield a great result totally worth it. I think I actually said out loud WOW when I polished it for the first time. I had no idea I could do THAT. So with your Mclaren you got a bit more to paint unless you do decal option  in which case make sure to have some Microsol and Microset decal setting and adhesive solutions. That way your decals wont stand out so much and wont silver. Generally speaking  clearcoats polish decals few more clear coats polish gentely and make sure to not put too much pressure on bumps and raised points so you wont eat through the paint work. Even pressure smooth. Some people will use K lacquers  it yields best results but also takes some extra techniques which im not goo with. Im sticking with Tamiya paints for now. Oh and avoid spray cans. Airbrush is best way to go!Final word  if you gonna build do make sure you get rid of the joining seam on tyres. Quite sad to see great F cars built but tyres that look like they just came off from a lego car.For inspiration check out instagram of this guy willi. He is amazing. Resinplastic kits. Mind blown. I mean best in world in my view and so few people follow him  but they should!  . This is the car you wanna built and something to aim for ,modelmakers,de7pvyb,2,t5_2sf9u

A B C that is a much more recent more expensive kit. M Walker Bulldog M or M tank destroyers again make sure these are the old kits and not the new ones KVThe PzII comes with five figures and seems to be the most commonly encountered in stores so I would recommend that one. As far as painting buy an airbrush. If dont know if youre serious about getting back into the hobby buy a rattlecan of your base coat it will greatly help out. Also get a gloss and a matte spray decals only set well on a gloss surface but obviously you want your overall model to be matte. Dont bother with advanced effects like washes pigments chipping etc until you can confidently paint a good clean model without them. No amount of effects is going to make your model look good if the base coat sucks or the assembly is sloppy.,modelmakers,der5x53,3,t5_2sf9u

11125312,0,t1_desrtjx,Ah the painting of my ICM Spitfire it went nowhere. The Humbrol paint I put on with a brush looked weird and the model ended up being used for testing my airbrush much later on. The model was nice though.I recommend using sanding sticks for dealing with flash ofc you will want to maybe use a knife to get the worst off or maybe a side cutter and a sanding stick to make it look nice.,modelmakers,det1mdu,1,t5_2sf9u

11549075,0,t1_dg4wgi7,Not as far as Ive noticed.On the  Im currently working on I goofed the paint and have to strip it off. Ive stripped it down to the plastic in some places and it doesnt seem like the primer has affected it.In fact the  is the reason I say avoid auto primer. The  has raised details but theyre nearly microscopic. The Painters Touch left the details still pretty defined but automotive primer made a good bit of the rivets disappear.,modelmakers,dg539oc,1,t5_2sf9u

11774384,0,t3_67zds1,Pretty good for starters but you should definitely study photos of existing vehicles museum ones or even old black and white ones to see how to paint. For example you painted the rims of the road wheels but not the return rollers or the spare road wheel. Headlights vision ports tools etc. are all painted the same colour. The decal placement is also very curious such as on top of the engine deck. You should also buy a pin vise and drill out the machinegun and cannon barrels.,modelmakers,dgunt7z,3,t5_2sf9u
