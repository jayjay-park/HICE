He found their show from Ancienne Belgique back in  on Youtube.We both quickly realized what we missed.,thecatempire,d1khvof,2,t5_2u033
7816847,0,t1_d0mxm2i,Its funny but your  comments describe exactly how I feel about the album. Steal the Light is probably my least favorite album.. This one felt like StL at first however Daggers Drawn stood out big time. This songs amazing. It reminds me of Anymore on the end of Cities but with an instrumental feel a la Sol y Sombra.. After  days of listening its now growing on me. I really like this album.. I still dont like Que Sera Ahora gt.ltI dont have the leaflet though Im listening on Spotify EDIT oh and the intro to Bataclan is annoying.,thecatempire,d3uofa3,2,t5_2u033

I was second in line when I arrived at  thinking doors were already open but by the time the doors actually did open I wished we stayed outside longer as fellow fans were playing songs dancing and singing along. Im sure lots of music shows have similar experiences but I wouldnt know since I hadnt gone to a show in years. The show itself was incredible and I cant wait to go again. ,thecatempire,d5yrkem,1,t5_2u033
