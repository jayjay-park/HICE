1652096,0,t3_2d88ac,For what your needs seem to be  Studentski Grad would be the place to go. Studentski Grad which means Students City is a neighborhood of Sofia where most of the residents are outoftown students and foreigners. It is right where your university is and socializing would be the least of your problems. Your biggest problem actually is going be trying to stay away from excessive socializing. Every single night there are parties and night activities so it can be hard to concentrate and easy to be tempted to party too much. If you already have trouble studying and concentrating  an apartment in Lozenetz or another notsodistant neighbourhood would be a better option. Itll be more expensive but at least you know that you can study. Public transportation is well developed there are busses and trams every few minutes and you can get from any location to any location pretty easily although some busses can be crazily overcrowded. The bus that goes to Studentski Grad is the most extreme example for that. Often the doors wont close thats how overcrowded it gets.That being said  its really easy to pass most classes. Professors are often willing to give you an extra push so you can pass the class even if youre doing bad. So I am guessing that you wont actually need to do a lot of studying and Studentski Grad would be a good fit for you.Good luck and enjoy your stay in Bulgaria!PS. Make sure you visit some of the nicer places at least in Sofia Studentski Grad is an ugly and not very well maintained area. ,bulgaria,cjnes1g,3,t5_2qhx7

You need a bunch of documents before the procedure even starts you have to prove that you are halfBulgarian  you need to contact the National Agency for Bulgarians Abroad        you need a copy of your birth certificate  and probably translation of it a certificate from your ... I dont know ... probably court that proves you are not and you havent been in jail and another that you are not currently under investigation or something like that a certificate from a hospital that you are not suffering any serious virus related illness  fill some forms and pay  leva   euro if you have no idea what that meansand more and more papers ...To sum it up  find a lawyer at least to get a consultation. That kind of information can be overwhelming a lawyer will cost you a little bit of money but it will save you a lot of time. Heshe will take care of all the necessary papers translations taxes etc. or at least tell you what exactly you need to do.You can also try to get some information from the Bulgarian Embassy andor National Agency for Bulgarians Abroad .I think knowing Bulgarian is not a requirement. The fact that you have Bulgarian father will make things much easier. The Bulgarian ID is the same as German. With it in Germany you are going to have the same rights are German guy in Bulgaria. You can stay up to six months for whatever reason after that you have to register in the local tax authority prove that you are working  and not doing something illegal to pay for your living start paying taxes and you are going to be just fine.I dont know your exact situation but there may be easier ways to go to Germany  if thats your main goal  without going trough the slow and painful procedure of getting Bulgarian citizenship. There are quite a lot of people  mainly from FYROM  that are waiting years to get their Bulgarian ID and Ive heard it is not fun at all. ,bulgaria,couv05n,1,t5_2qhx7

The way they bailed out Deutsche Bank was hardly progressive.  I agree with you that Bulgaria is too close to Western powers. In fact I think that Bulgaria has turned into a classical client state of the US and Europe in the same way as Latin American countries were to the US during the last century.As for Islamophobia being a Western Invention well Im not sure thats true.  Im pretty sure it began in the Middle East.

Using the meaningless leftright orientation I see.  was not a right oriented party and has never been also my grandma on FATHERs side had been a delegate to the  congress in the past.  back then was a dynamic entity and had two distinct phases   as a mixture of new and old parties and movements where the Old Guard who had morals experience and ideas had a dominant say and then the Kostov Period which started indeed with a formal and trivial thing as picking JJ for President and I pretty much agree with your definition about him. From there on  entered a downward spiral of disintegration and degradation with the Old Guard parties leaving the coalition and the new arrogant and greedy fucks not to mention names taking over. I got into the melee just for a couple of years around  and bailed out had better things to do. My father was expelled from  in  after the Gorunya Trial joined after they invited him back in  and then left disappointed after just a few years when it became clear that arrogance and greed were not the domain of a certain party they were integral part of any form of governance and the Ordnung the new order brought by the democratic right left or whatever you call the mixture of scum that came after presented opportunities never seen before.

9418060,0,t1_d99s9z8,I know that feeling. Lucky for me I have a few colleagues who push me to speak morelearn more. Also the occasional gossip about me that they dont think I understand its cute.A good place to start is when someone asks you a word in English you ask them in Bulgarian. Ive found that its quite easy to build up my lexicon this way. As far as grammar and forms are concerned its nothing a few weeks of courses cant teach you.       etc. Theres also a few tricky words which end with gender identifications that can be misleading. Fortress for example is . It took me a lot longer than I would like to admit but I eventually understood that this is a feminine word. Also pastpresentfuture tenses and then combining those with their genders. It feels a bit overwhelming at first but its easy to adapt once you get past that part.,bulgaria,d99syrw,2,t5_2qhx7

10863547,0,t1_de0ebbj,Well those were just the details that I could  come up with on a short notice. There are other real parts and items that were made up. Under the Yoke is also not without its criticism. Unlike a lot of the authors from the period Vazov never took part in the revolution. In some of his other works he also takes it upon himself to be the arbiter of truth. When Tobacco was first published it became an instant hit. It was however a bit blurry on whether it villified or gloryfied the industialists of the s so the party ordered a rewrite. Some characters were added and plots expanded. The comunist party considered the novel a masterpiece and so made it a superrequired reading. That is why a lot of people today deny the books as thrash. In reality the novel glides on a lot of the subjects. ,bulgaria,de0hxxr,2,t5_2qhx7
