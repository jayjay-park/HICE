1082485,0,t3_26hmoc,I think the minor is basically just Physiology NPB  if you want to learn Physiology BIM  If you want to read a lot of journal articles and then  units of classes from our upper division courses.  It really depends on what you want to go into but Id say that most of the BME courses wont relate to bioinstrumentation enough to merit the minor. In terms of employers i have no idea if they care  I know your EE grades will definitely take priority.  Im graduating this quarter and ive noticed a strong reluctance in the private sector to take people with the major seriously because we cover too much without going enough in depth to any one part. If bioinstrumentation on a noncellular level is your goal and you wanna have a hand at the minor Id suggest the following course list from our majorBIM C in the Fall with Dr. Tan   units not really an engineering course but goes over a lot of detail about pathology used in diagnositcs and then talks about the development of point of care testing.  Decent amount of bio in it.BIM C in the spring with Don Chigazola  Don is an expert in manufacturing in the biomed industry and he teaches a  unit course that goes over manufacturing practices and techniques used in the private sector as well as some other basic intro to things you will run into industry.BIM   Its a  unit bioinstrumentation course.  If youre an EE and you know pretty much anything about circuits you should breeze through it compared to most BME students.  Just be careful to pay attention to what the teacher talks about because Dr. Pan doesnt like to go over any of the circuits stuff nor does he believe in examples.  The tests are only about half circuits though the other half is just things discussed in class.BIM    Units also taught by Dr. Pan its a cross over class between EE and BME about manufacturing processes in micro and nano fabrication.  The class itself isnt particularly difficult no circuits  just memorization and some physics  but there is a lab portion that is pretty fun.  You get to use a laser cutter and a plasma bonder to make some microfluidics channels and some basic PDMS sensors.  Lot of time but a lot of fun.  Beware the project though  Pan is a dick about grading it.   and then a  unit elective relating to whatever you feel is appropriate to what you might want to do.I still think that if you want to do bioinstrumentation really focus on instrumentation cross over classes between our major and yours or between mechanical and EE like control systems or something and really know your ground there  it translates into lots of different fields of study so you have lots of options in terms of industry later.If you wanna learn more though talk to Rosalind the BME adviser  shes super nice very practical and really helpful.  Just as a warning doesnt have an engineering background but she knows her stuff about the BME major and minor.PM me if you wanna know more about BME or some of the classes.  I havent taken a lot of them but I took more elective units than most people in my major.  Graduating senior.,UCDavis,chrbxky,7,t5_2rcax

Everyone I know in CS who has done it for the money is no longer a CS major. They all get weeded out.If you are extremely passionate about both of these fields then give Computational Statistics a try. It sounds right up your alley. If you truly love both of these fields of science to the extent that you consider yourself above in beyond in both fields then do the double major. Just dont do it for the money. Do it because you want to. Because if you do it for the money you will get fucked. Hard.I know a guy who double majored in statistics and CS and graduated in  years and a quarter NOT a transfer not including summer. He was very talented though and graduated with a ..

3550449,0,t3_30k3df,Graphic DesignerNetwork System Admin hereI currently work on campus.  I wear many hats one of them is a designer hat.  I went to school here in the mid s and took design courses.  I then transferred to another school to focus on design.If design is truly what you want to do then make sure to look at all the alternatives.  While UCDavis is a great university and has a wonderful Design program  there are other schools  that might match your design goals better. Make sure to look at the jobs that are out there and whether they match up with both your personal goals and monetary goals. Having a design background can help with all sorts of jobs that arent JUST design.  D Animators TV programmers storyboarders filmmakers anything that visually communicated a message can benefit from a design background.Understand that there are very few actual Design firms out there and only the people who own them are the actual ones who will get paid well.  if you feel that you can manage your own business then Freelancing would definitely be a great solution.  There are some good books out there that covers that.Graphic Design in academia is almost nonexistent.  If you want to get paid well stay away from academia.Here is an exampleA basic beginner ArtistDesigner at UCDavis gets paid about K to K a year.  A senior level designer might only get paid K to k a year.  if you have a web design background and know HTML  and CSS and have some backend database programming knowledge you can instantly add K to your salary.  However here is the caveat  It takes time to become a programmerdesigner.  Most people will choose one or the other.  We live in a world where all web design is starting to look the same because it needs to work on all the different devices.  Themes and templates that are predesigned are starting to become readily available to the basic consumer and they are very easy to use so those types of jobs are going away.  We also live in a world where the printed medium is starting to change drastically.  Digital exchange of info is changing so much that even things like business cards are slowly evolving into other digital forms of handouts.This being said...Design. Design. Design.  Until you get some projects under your belt you might not want to design for money.  Yet.  Love what you do.  Love the Process.  The process is the most important part and really focusing on this will turn you into a good designer.  managing a relationship between a client and their project is a very tricky thing.  Understanding that you are dictating the relationship and are the visual communication expert in it is important.Understanding why is essential in design. You will learn this over the length of your courses.  Why did you choose that font? Why is there spacing there? Why does this seem to work better when its on a darker color?  You will not only need to learn to communicate with other designers but you will need to learn to Visually Express yourself in laymans terms to NONDesigners. This skill is a must.Draw.  Sketch.  Learn Illustrator.  These three things will help you take your ideas from concept to actualization quickly.  when you take your drawing classes really practice the techniques and apply them to your designs.  Get a Sketchbook.  Draw everything.  Even Fonts.  Start playing around with how different fonts work with one another.  Make the FONTS HUGE.. Make the FONT THE IMAGE.This will be an everevolving skill.  Finally Learn Illustrator.  This is a vector based program  yes there are other vector based programs out there but this is the industry norm  You will create vector which are mathamatically drawn images no math needed where your designs will be scaleable images which will look beautiful on any media you put it on.Photoshop is great but too many designers only work in photoshop and never take their skills to Illustrator and have a rough go at it further on down the road.  DONT RELY ON PLUGINS.    you might find yourself wanting to make a change that you cant make because you relied on a plugin.  If you really learn the ins and outs of  the programs you will find that most plugins are unnecessary.Learn the Keyboard Command as the FIRST thing when you sit down to the program. this will increase your productivity tenfold.Adobe designed their programs to be used with one hand on the keyboard and one hand on the mouse.This is all I have right now.

When I moved into my dorm the configuration upon arrival had the ethernet completely covered by a wardrobe. Your port could possibly be behind something if the previous resident didnt care about connecting to ethernet.Another option is to find a neighbor with a port and arrange to borrow their wifi password if they have their own router or split the cost of a router with them.

8458477,0,t1_d5y9m66,Ill just list some specific incidents Ive had in my  years as a driver. I once had a mentally ill passenger so angry at me that I legitimately feared for my safety. During some protests many of our routes got impacted and couldnt get back to campus. We couldnt run normal service anymore and those working were basically being given the random buses that could make it back and driving whatever route Dispatch needed right then. I had a bus break down in the middle of my high school line. It was over  degrees out and we had no AC obviously. The other bus took over  minutes to get to us and once it did it couldnt fit around the first bus which we couldnt move because it was broken down... Buses that are so crowded you have to turn passengers away. Telling that to someone who has a midterm in  minutes is really fun! Just getting stuck in really awkward places. We arent allowed to back up without a spotter so if you get too close to a car or something you have to wait for a supervisor to come out. I was blocking traffic for over  minutes once having to tell people that I wasnt allowed to back up. On Picnic day the W line had a reroute due to the parade. My dispatcher misread the directions to me so I ended up missing the turn. It should have been a super easy minute fix but for some reason he had me drive the entire hourlong route its longer on picnic day again with all of my passengers. I literally had passengers berating me and telling me to just not listen to my supervisor. I called him multiple times practically begging to take a faster route and he refused still no idea why.Ill add more if I think of them. Haha,UCDavis,d5yuejr,3,t5_2rcax

I find the whole we liberals want America to do the right thing subjective. What exactly is the right thing? Open all borders? Bringing in the culture of Islam and getting rid of American culture? Getting rid of the American flag because it represents oppression and hate as many SJWs will say. You do NOT have to fly the American flag but I would love to understand why they went out of their way to do this. Why put the energy and time into doing this? Seems to me that they have a personal problem with the flag. What is that problem? Also you said But their intent was to try to make their immediate community feel more welcoming and comfortable... The flag makes people feel uncomfortable and not welcomed? Are you kidding? The flag that represents our nation and values of freedom offends people? Thats true it offends people.
