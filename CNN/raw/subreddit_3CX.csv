9831421,0,t1_da9j0mo,Hi Magnetic  No we do not do that. You misunderstood. This person Opalbiz was repeatedly out of line towards my team. Supposedly a CX partner Opalbiz got free support free training and NFR licenses. So we terminated Opalbiz CX partner status. Any commercial license keys remained working. No I will not accept our team and staff being sworn at either on the phone or in the forums. If thats a problem then indeed best to choose another PBX. ,3CX,dap20kz,1,t5_38i3d

Funnily enough on my pass run I felt really confident while answering. As soon as I finished and saw the green light I did the intermediate exam and passed that first time too with a score of !I thought the intermediate was a little easier if anything some of the questions were quite common sense for example there was one about phones on a LAN using a subnet that didnt exist.I think the advanced will be tricky as I havent done much in the way of upgrading and i think there will be some nasty can you do X when you upgrade ones!,3CX,dg0cas4,1,t5_38i3d
