97438,1,t1_cepcg9w,Honestly I fail to see why this is an issue.  I recently bought a DS after having a vita for a year and a half and I can definitely say the price of games for the DS the firstparty titles everyone wants costs more than what you spend on the memory sticks and games for the Vita.  Even a game like super mario  ds a  year old game still sells for  on amazon a ridiculous price IMO for a piece of software that old.  This just gives an idea of Nintendos game prices.Even if I had bought a  GB Vita mem card for its regular price instead of  when it was on sale I still would be saving money after buying Vita games compared to just buying games for my DS. ,vita,cepiu9z,0,t5_2sjmv

137856,0,t1_cetndme,The better ones Ive found  at least playing them on the Vita  are the ones that have made use of the analogue sticks if the game suits it and certainly those that have been designed at the Vitas native screen resolution. Most are capable of being produced at that from what Ive come across but there are a few that seem to be cut down slightly.The big problems right now I agree is the Store support as theres no promotion for it and its not integrated properly with normal Vita games even in the way that Minis are and for games that dont need the touch screen theres no reason why PS compatibilty cant be introduced. Surprisingly theres no sign on PSM on the Japanese store for Vita TV either.With Quiet Please Ive found that the best in the series so far is Vacation Vexation and once youve completed it and its a LOT longer than the other two! you can go back to it afterwards to keep playing pretty much indefinitely. Hopefully the fourth in the series will offer just as much longterm appeal.,vita,ceu4r8w,1,t5_2sjmv

160807,0,t1_cewqqbz,gt People who want console quality experiences play on a console they arent interested in  minutes of The Last of Us while they wait for the bus they play angry birds instead.I think youve touched on an important point there. Whatever you think about Angry Birds if youve only got a spare  minutes then its no doubt more suitable to play Angry Birds than something like the Last of Us. If Im playing the Last of Us Im sitting down for a good  hour session at least. The point Im trying to make is console games and handheld games are intrinsically different by their very nature. Thats why Pokemon and Tetris were so successful on the Game Boy  you could dip in and out for a quick  minutes wherever you were.The style of games on the Vita dont strike me as particularly suited to a handheld. Theyre just console games... on a handheld. They could be on the PS and it would make no difference. I got my Vita at Christmas and so far Im yet to play it anywhere other than my house. Maybe its something Sony should consider. Then again maybe marketing it as console quality games on a handheld is a good thing. who knows?,vita,cewqz2b,2,t5_2sjmv

291381,0,t1_cfahj0v,If you live on campus then school is a VERY small percentage of what you are likely to do regardless of your major although some require a lot more schoolwork than others.  College has morphed over the years to provide more and more life experiences outside of the classroom from sports to events to various other social experiences and having free and open access to the Internet is just one element of this.While a high school should generally just be about school since you are only there during the times that you are supposed to be learning except in boarding situations and the like college or University for those outside the US as what we in the US consider college is a bit different from what much of the world considers it should allow a huge amount of open access to the outside world from a digital standpoint.Many colleges will allow their users to register certain devices to work outside of the normal security requirements it has for the network.  Gaming devices tablets and smartphones come to mind as device that may not be designed to work with a very specific WindowsMaconly process for connecting.  Head over to your colleges network adminstration hub ask around to figure out who handles network connectivity and ask what the procedure is for connecting your specific device.  If they have a method of doing so then go for it.Edit if all you want to do is remote play while within wifi range you may be able to connect anyway if this article is accurate,vita,cfaysmr,2,t5_2sjmv

327293,0,t3_1xtvp3,People always attribute the Vitas poor sales exclusively to smartphones. These people arent wrong entirely wrong but they lack any sort of imagination and are only capable of regurgitating what tech journalists say.The PSPs market was made up of two basic pillars Monster Hunter and Media Features. While this may be overly simplified I think it gets the point across. The Monster Hunter pillar was almost entirely absorbed by the DS. The Media Pillar was the side absorbed by smartphones. Basically it wasnt smartphone games that hurt the Vita it was their ability to play music browse the Internet and watch movies.

411083,0,t3_1ys74k,The PS version comes with a digital animated comic of the first game  Im unsure if this is included with the Vita release but you can watch it here regardless.I love MGS but the first one is admittedly a classic and quite dated. My friend just recently attempted to jump in with the MGS Legacy Collection on PS but found the first game a bit too old for his liking and actually went out and bought Twin Snakes the GameCube remake in order to experience the story with some updated gameplay mechanics.I think youll find the animated digital comic will catch you up on the narrative quite nicely. Or if youd sooner just the actual comic you can find it in the MGS omnibus hereHope you enjoy the HD Collection!

479720,0,t3_1zl9wl,I think some of the biggest gripes are because they have become spoiled with the OLED on the original Vita.  It could also be from seeing smart phones that have much nicer screens than the Vita Slim does for roughly the same cost. Folks wonder why they sony went with a cheaper display technology when there are many low cost solutions out there that could provide a better picture for the same price as the LCD.Also the original thought of the slim Vita was that it was going to be cheaper since they are using cheaper components and it is easier for Sony to produce on a mass scale. However as of right now they arent any cheaper. I guess people just feel like its pointless to release a cheaper built product when it costs the same if not more than the old model that its replacing.They could have easily improved on the current Vita design and made refinements to make it better but instead they decided to do a complete external overhaul and skimp on one key feature that many people had grown accustomed to. I guess theres a certain luxury to the OLED on the Vita versus that of the ds it gave the Vita some elegance that the other handheld on the market didnt have. Now with the slim the screens are much closer to the ds in quality. Its also change and as you may know people dont like change.  Honestly I dont think its going to be that big of a deal once more people get them in their hands theyll come around. I think the biggest thing that a lot of people miss especially the ones that get so upset about the new LCD panel is most of the people that will be buying the Vita Slim are probably people that are completely blind to the Vita  currently. It will more than likely be their first Vita purchase and they wont know any better.  That screen will be more than sufficient for them. ,vita,cfuspm2,1,t5_2sjmv

590349,0,t3_20wi8w,I might be the minority here in saying that I simply love the idea of BL on the Vita and I will be preordering it soon. Im not with most of rvita when I say that an exclusive wont make the Vita amazing and an instant success so Im just taking what we get in stride I mean I am not disappointed with any Vita game Ive played so far. We all think Sony needs to release more Vita exclusives but what seems to be the popular bitching point of this sub is that it has to be good. Okay good things dont happen very fast and we all know that Sony is paying as little attention to the Vita as possible without neglecting it entirely. I never got to play Borderlands  by myself I played it with my boyfriend last year so when I heard about it I was excited. I like ports. I like good ports. Im just wondering what this sub wants an exclusive of. The Vita has exclusives and Im sorry but you are not going to get KZM quality out of all of them. That takes money and time that we all know Sony wont invest in anymore unless something happens up top management that makes them look at the Vita differently and see that they could actually make a better dent in the handheld game. EDIT I guess Im looking at the reality of it all. Most people want Americans studios to come out with that amazing Vita exclusive while Im enjoying the Japanese ones that tend to get released here. ,vita,cg7dke5,3,t5_2sjmv

Im assuming that the author did not modify the pledge descriptions i dont even think you can anyway? so people crying out that they thought they would get any digital version at those early tiers are full of it unless the author at some point stated otherwise. What would upset me is if Im at the  tier and I didnt get the PSVita code automatically. Why? Because hes offering the upgrade of  to the  donors.

It is still a great device that had to get some kinks worked out and it now has gotten those together with a downgrade to the screen.I see a lot of claims of people saying they should return their Vita or upgrade. Ive gotten mine for  Euro a few weeks ago and Ive seen them here between the  Euro range. The Slim will probably retail around  Euro. Does it warrant the  Euro extra for everyones usecase? I dont think so for me I wouldnt get much use out of a bigger battery since I use it mostly at home.

961856,0,t1_chdl4ha,You say youre not talking about attractiveness but when you ask about the point of getting a platinum three times for one game you are indeed talking about how attractive the game is to trophy hunters.  Offering separate trophy lists makes the game more attractive to someone looking for trophies especially if the game offers platinum trophies.  What is the point of getting the platinum three times? Getting the platinum three times is the point and is what makes a multiplatform game with separate trophy lists attractive to a trophy hunter.For example lets assume Game A and Game B were out at the same time and I was hunting for a new game.  I would research the trophy lists and discover that Game A had separate trophy lists for each platform and Game B didnt.  Assuming the trophies for each game were attainable e.g. no server shutdowns or lack of MP community no game breaking glitches etc then if the games were the same price Game A would have a much higher value to me as a trophy hunter than Game B.  Thus I would be much more likely to purchase it.  If I enjoyed the experience then I would be much more likely to purchase it again on a different platform assuming no crossbuy so that I could relive the excitement of earning the platinum.Anyway not having multiple trophy lists isnt a deal breaker but since the option was provided I would much prefer having multiple trophy lists over a single shared trophy lists because I enjoy hunting trophies.,vita,chdmeki,2,t5_2sjmv

982310,0,t1_chfxg89,The load times in final fantasy are because of it being a port of a PS game. The PS had so little RAM something like MB that they were forced to make small maps and many loading screens.The load times on the PS version of FFX are actually longer than on the vita because of the higher res textures.The Vita can handle large maps without loading just fine.

In fact it would be kind of dumb not to I mean to make remote play work required by the way they have to map to the vita controls anyways. Half of the port is done just upscale the psp res or downscale the ps res and slap that bitch on the digimarket.Its pure profit at that point. Am I missing some dumb reason why thats impossible?

I love indies I didnt say that they couldnt sell or that people couldnt like them just like I didnt say people couldnt like Ubisoft games or Free to Play or Japanese games or whatever. I just said that they have a style that not everyone likes. Indies tend to focus on a singular strong gameplay mechanic e.g. rotating dimensions in Fez building in Minecraft exploration in No Mans Sky time manipulation in Braid etc. whereas AAA games are much less focused in order to appeal to more people and thus make a profit.Bethesda games like Skyrim and Fallout create big worlds with attention to combat story lore etc. The Batman games put emphasis on combat immersion action and so on. Even Call of Duty and other simple FPS games try to cater to as many different kinds of players as possible via attention to multiplayer single player different play styles quick slow etc. and so on. And they also have what no indie game has money and resources. It takes a lot of money to hire a team of artists and animators thus indie games usually have lower budget visuals and sound design.To say that you cant find a pattern in indie games is idiotic. And to imply that you cant not like whatever pattern that is is equally idiotic.,vita,cijfg33,4,t5_2sjmv

I mean sure VCS is more like San Andreas and I love being able to fly choppers and planes and being able to enter so many shops and buildings and even start my own businesses. Also ride around on a BMX.  But LCS has my favourite character in any GTA game Toni Cipriani. I love him with a passion! I also like the darker tone to LCS and the narrative was pretty cool and very twisted at times.  Also I had more fun with the multiplayer on LCS.

I expected it to be more on par with how lego pirates was on ps. Meaning it was more episodic but still somewhat open. Instead its limited to two characters per map gold bricks determine how far through the game you can play needing you to max out certain levels to the best of your ability to progress and a few other factors I am not too pleased about. Ultimately I think it loses its charm since you are constantly thrown into the menu and loading screens and lose even the limited openness of lego pirates let alone the openness of the ps version or lotr.If you can find them cheap they are fun for bite sized amounts of play but dont expect the immersion of the psps versions,vita,cisyuwc,1,t5_2sjmv

1416589,0,t1_cits8pd,gt android games are no better or worse than what is commonly available on a Vita as an indie game.False. Ive yet to play an Android game that is as compelling for me as Soul Sacrifice. And theres no comparison to KillzoneMercenary for a handheld FPS. Those are just two examples. The most commonly played title on my android phone is Smash Hit. A simple casual game.gt If you want to play a game seriously youd play on a console or PCMaybe you have that limited of a selection but I play games wherever they come for the most part. In the last two weeks alone Ive played games on Vita PC both Windows and Linux DS PS PS and even my dusty Xbox . Oh lets not forget FF Type on my PSP. Kind of silly for you to imply none of that gameplay other than the PC is serious. gt its AAA games are expensive and there arent enough there to warrant a purchase for most people which in turn means people arent buying it and devs arent making games because it isnt worth their time.AAA games are meant to be expensive.. one of the As is for budget. A high development budget implies higher cost. The Vita is turning into more of a niche device but the die hard fans are still being serviced and the device is not a complete failure nor does it appear to be going away any time. It offers a different experience than other platforms and thats a good thing. Variety is the spice of life.gt vita is the worst thing to buy for indie games right now. youre better off buying an ipod touch.Again untrue. Maybe if youre fine with touch controls only which I am not. The Vita offers dual analogs and an amazing dpad. A true gaming device not a multipurpose device that also lets you play Walking Dead or Plants vs Zombiesgt you havent given a compelling argument as to why the vita is better than anything else.Pretty sure Ive given reasons why I find it to be superior to the Shield. Im not saying it is a device that makes  of the people happy  of the time.. But I fucking love mine and if you want to regret your purchase and pee all over the decision to buy one thats your prerogative.gt  youd rather be cynical than have a normal discussion. Hmm besides my admittedly snarky Dont worry Ill wait you appear to be far more cynical than me and fairly dismissive of the Vita overall. ,vita,citujbf,1,t5_2sjmv

1484438,0,t1_cj236a4,Goodness Alundra  is one of the biggest disappointments in my life. It has nothing to do with the first Alundra and in fact they shifted from the dark setting of the first game in which major themes were despair fear and false faith to a cookiecutter happygolucky anime complete with bumbling comic relief characters and slapstick humor. Gameplaywise they shifted to a very clunky D compared to the sharp controls of the first game. I dunno even taking it away from the context of its fantastic predecessor I just feel like Alundra  is a mediocre game.I would also unfortunately suggest avoiding the PSP version of Final Fantasy Tactics as well and instead go for the PS classic version. When they ported that to PSP they did something to make everything just run so slowly. Just everything takes longer than it should. YMMV on this but I know for myself it bothers me too much to play that game.Adding more to the RPG list both Grandia PS and Mana Kemia PSP have fantastically fun battle systems that basically give you a bunch of tools to manage the flow of battle which I think makes fighting a lot more dynamic than what you normally see in JRPGs. I also remember playing so much of Wild Arms  and to a lesser extent Breath of Fire  both PS.If youre looking for something a bit more actiony Jet Set Radio is an interesting take on the skating genre. Its like a skating platformer where the object is to find the paths that will bring you up to the obscure places where you have to tag with graffiti.,vita,cj2cllq,2,t5_2sjmv

1777871,0,t1_ck2uaxm,gtIm saying elbow room would not matter since niche titles get served regardless of how many major titles a platform gets.Which is wrong. Youre comparing the Vita to systems that have millions of ownersat those numbers niche titles get the same amount or more sales as the Vita due to sheer consumer size alone.gtIf there were big AAAs on the Vita to the point that it would matter those who wanted said games would buy the system.Thats not a logical gap. Weve seen AAA games come to the Vita and no one has bought. There were noticeably less niche titles coming out when Borderlands  and Killzone were the talk of the Vita. Youre not taking what Im saying at face value enough. Simply put the only reason why the Vitas still getting any games at all is because these niche and indie games dont have competition.

Not sure Ill ever be able to get to Rule The Universe in AFM or the wizard mode on Medieval Madness.Do you play your Vita pinball in portrait or landscape mode?  I saw some forums where people said it looks great in portrait but I just cant get behind using the touchscreen flippers. Would be nice if there was an option to use the X and Triangle buttons for the flippers in portrait mode but so far I cant find a way to do that.Will check out Zen and FX pinball at some point.  In the meantime Im having too much fun with the S Pinball Arcade tables to try anything else!,vita,cka8ktz,1,t5_2sjmv

Consoles in general did games better than any of my computers did. And honestly I really dont find I need  fps in any game.  fps is fine with me hell even less than that I usually dont notice. But I definitely dont care if it only reaches fps even sorry but from my perspective it seems super picky to find getting only  fps.

2117184,0,t3_2j6w2o,depends. which anime are you more a fan of? one piece red doesnt really explain whats going on or who the characters are so you gotta be a fan in order to understand why they matter. the combats fun but its not depth enough. it has a rpg system and its really grindy so if you you like grinding games then this is it. SAO has a brief explanation on the story and characters. if youre looking for content this game has it. this is probably the biggest game for content that i ever seen in a vita game. i think it has even more content than PG. theres a lot of story mostly voice acted scenes and events when it involves the main characters of the series and it says true to the personalities of each characters. honestly i would go for SAO because the game has a lot going for it. ,vita,cl8xutk,2,t5_2sjmv

That means I still have a lot of work left to do getting everything else through Hard too.But yeah getting your first Extreme Perfect wont be too bad but some songs are definitely easier than others. For me I picked out Tell Your World as the easiest one of my favorites and I spent ten or so attempts a few days in a row to nail it.

Arc  is much more of an rpg in that there is world exploration and everything from items to armor levels up. It features a new cast that will team up with the old cast to stop an evil empire from capturing special children with elemental abilities.These are great games and the combat is light TRPG.

2227839,0,t3_2kne02,If you can get your hands on both try playing with both in your hands. I like having a certain weight to my consoles and the Slim made me feel slightly uncomfortable as compared to the original.The other thing I would consider is the proprietary charger cable for the original as opposed to the micro cable for the slim. Its not so much the fact that it is a pain in the ass but more of a precaution if you happened to lose it or misplace it. Its cheaper and easier to get micro usbs as opposed to the original vita cable.Personally I like the screen on the original vita better but I have heard of many others preferring the screen on the slim model. In all honesty if youre not picky about your selection in TVs then you probably wouldnt notice a significant difference between the original and slim model. Again if possible its best to get a comparison of the two for yourself. Also try touching the screen and see how comfortable you are with it touching the slim screen made me uncomfortable for some reason but it might be my mentality that I already own the original so this is probably just paranoia on my part.,vita,cln0fdi,1,t5_2sjmv

2252747,0,t1_clq3n3x,I agree that the default controls suck but do note that they are fully rebindable. Also the game follows the old school way of being difficult a little which is being somewhat unfair though the game does give you tons of possibilities to buy health restores with very little consequences so it balances out. Not exactly sure why you would think the game controls like mud for me its very accurate very smooth and very responsive. You want bad control scheme? Check out Vanillawares previous game Odins Sphere. Its a great game and all but the controls do feel pretty stiff and need some adaption and a lot of pretimed movement.As for the button mashing while I do agree that it could have been handled much better you do have to put into consideration that Vanillaware tried to treat this game as an ActionRPG even when it doesnt feel like that at all. Instead of combos the focus is on welltimed attacks and dodges in addition to abusing your sword abilities and blade switching seriously abuse those they help tons. I also suspect that you probably tend to rely on long swords and not swords. While long swords are better for crowds swords are superior in handling very quick strikes to singular or very mobile targets while also being much faster. Try to rely on swords more often and dont worry too much about the damage input.If you want a control scheme to help you play the game heres mine X for jump  for attack  for dodge  for block R for switch blade and L for ability.,vita,clq5tye,8,t5_2sjmv

2286058,0,t3_2lfgq5,Not that I particularly care about reviews but I think this one was rather egregiously bad...Im pretty sure the reviewer didnt finish the game because they complain about having to tediously walk around everywhere which is something that is no longer necessary the instant you unlock the quick travel function.Also they complain about the controls and make no mention of the MANY different control schemes in the game leading me to believe that they were probably too lazy to bother changing control schemes to see if one of the alternate ones was less awkward.Overall it just seems like all they ended up saying was that the game sucked because the story wasnt great fair enough the controls sucked and the environments were bad...disgustingly lazy review IMO.

If you refuse to try any of them that is your problem.DS gets fewer releases than Vita does. Its just they tend to be more popular with the mass market. Vita got more big western AAAs than DS ever will. DS gets the bigger of the Japanese market. But Vita gets far more niche Japanese content. Vita gets more indies. And DS and Vita are pretty much equal with licensed western stuff now. ,vita,cny53if,7,t5_2sjmv

3000739,0,t1_co8psgj,I think you confuse the Vita itself with the nature of the market it and the DS for that matter entered.Sony and Nintendo were shellshocked by iPhones success. Square Enix and other big publishers and studios were shellshocked by Facebook Zynga and casual games Angry Birds.The whole business changed and the two handhelds I mentioned arrived smack in the middle of a huge global economic depression with no clear hint as to where the market and audience for games would go or what it consists of.So we got these place your bets on all the numbers devices. Its only now that were starting to see things settle down a bit. Theres more understanding of what the audience wants and also very important what it can afford. That constrains whats possible.And the future will be different again and entirely unpredictable. ,vita,co90w6t,1,t5_2sjmv

First he goes to rent a tux but theres a long tux line at the shop and it takes forever.Next he has to get some flowers so he heads over to the florist and theres a huge flower line there. He waits forever but eventually gets the flowers.Then he heads out to rent a limo. Unfortunately theres a large limo line at the rental office but hes patient and gets the job done.Finally the day of the prom comes. The two are dancing happily and his girlfriend is having a great time. When the song is over she asks him to get her some punch so he heads over to the punch table and theres no punchline.Lastly as its funny as heck I will provide you with Batcat....for ten hours!,vita,coabvj8,1,t5_2sjmv

3058670,0,t3_2v70co,The thing is they are pretty different. I have samurai warriors  and SSD and they are completely different in aim. WO is all about the characters. The combat is in true dynasty warriors fashion pretty repetative but most people can overlook it because its fun. SSD has its own unique combat system based around items. Which items you bring on a mission affect what moves you use. In terms of content WO if your going for platinum takes FOREVER. However SSD has so much extra content and side missions that it also will take a long time to finish especially for platinum. So id say they are even but I would give the edge to SSD because it actually does have a fascinating story and an online mode where you can play with others in whatever faction you choose.

3092449,0,t1_coihrj2,The power required to emulate a console on different hardware is much higher than the power of the console thats being emulated. For example youve got Wii games being ported to the DS but that doesnt mean the DS can emulate a Wii with full functionality. Ported games are optimized to run on different hardware. Emulated games are being run with the original software on different hardware. Two very different things.,vita,coij4ip,13,t5_2sjmv

3093208,0,t1_coihv9d,you dont actully know how emulation works do you? you just assume if one thing works it should apply to all? lets put this in perspective. GOW on the vita runs at sub FPS during battles and that was ported for the vitas hardware. knowing this what makes you think the vita is powerful enough to emulate the pss hardware AND instruction set if it cant even run a ps game port as well as the original system did? it cant. simple as that. heres how emulators actually work. a game is made for a specific hardware architecture. writing for this architecture requires a game to use an instruction set the hardware uses. this does not exist on other hardwarethe vita for exampleto make this work an emulator needs to emulate the hardware to make the game think its on the original hardware. then it need to take the instruction set and make it work on a different system.the general rule is that you need a system thats atleast x as powerful as the original to get the game running at all. to get playablefull speed ps games even most high tier gaming systems choke on many games. SotC has many performance issues that carried over from the ps which brings us to the issue of some games needing special fixes to work properly. not all games worked entirely the same.emulating the ps isnt possible on the thing being made for portable gaming. it also doesnt even use all the hardware power either. like the psp its default under clock so the system doesnt overheat and use up battery too fast. no way it can even come close to booting a ps game in emulated form. a piece of dog turd could emulate the pss mhz cpu. modern watches have more then enough to do that. ,vita,coilyfa,5,t5_2sjmv
3093687,0,t1_coinjjf,gt This video features two Japanese games.Yes and one of them that he mentioned was not in the video. He obviously keeps up on news to know of games outside of this game.gtThere are a lot of Japanese games coming to Vita but the majority have no western release confirmed.Of course the majority dont most probably wont ever see it across the sea. That doesnt mean I cant instantly think of three Japanese games with confirmed releases in Oreshika Tainted Bloodlines shown in video Rainbow Skies and Mighty No. . Two of the games are Indies but at least the latter was a hugely successful KickStarter game. And of course Oreshika is from Sony so thats a game worth noting.gtOf the ones that do have western releases confirmed once again only two are highlighted in this video. Once again I am sure this person I replied to knows more about the Vita than what was shown to him in the ad and I wasnt speaking directly to the ads presentation.gtThats before we get the kind of Japanese games that are on Vita and how the majority will turn most westerners away.Well thats their fault for not trying them. ,vita,coinqrf,0,t5_2sjmv

3102113,0,t1_cojbv7s,hey Im one of the developers. N isnt out yet were almost finished but yes itll be a lot different than N and N! To be honest we were never happy with how the PSP and DS versions of N felt. N feels great plus its even smoother than ever before. Its like butter if butter ran at fps in p The core game is the same but we amped everything up including the graphics and effects which are all rendered in super smooth vector graphics. Weve added a bunch of new enemies and a boatload of new levels over  plus a few game modes were very excited about. We retooled the Coop and Race multiplayer from the XBLA version of N and really cant wait to see people playing the new levels  especially in Race which is deep and strategic and playable as an eSport now.Since this will be the last game in the series ever were pulling out all the stops adding as much as we can without getting gimmicky and in general ensuring it is the best possible version of this game that we could ever create so that we can feel comfortable putting the series to rest. We consider N the final iteration of N not a sequel. This is the game we wanted to make way back in   but due to lack of time budget and experience we were only able to create a sort of first draft. It took us ten years but we think we finally nailed it Feel free to ask more questions if youd like!,vita,cojj6t9,4,t5_2sjmv

3322826,0,t3_2y6hq9,I was in the exact same situation as you and decided to do a side by side comparison to make my final decision.  I already had a  model and purchased a mint used  from my local GameStop to do comparisons on and come to a final decision.I very much liked the new design and better L amp R buttons.  The lighter weight was also very noticeable and had a better overall feel to it.  These thoughts are subjective but also nowhere near deal breaker taritory for .The issue that arose when comparing the exact same game in the exact same location of that game was the loss of imersion I felt when on the .  It is hard to explain but I will try.  The new  screen does a good job overall and the slight degraded color depth did not really bother me what did annoy was what I can only describe as the refresh rate and screen tracking.  For most games I tested your moving character would be crisp and detailed while traversing his location as he would normally be in the middle of the screen and tracking clearly but it was easily noticeable that your background environments took a hit in clarity and lost that crisp look.  Kind of like minor ghosting but not.  I dont know how else to describe it.  The  unit kept up with your character and backgrounds while keeping them all equally crisp.  This was especially noticeable in d sprite based games but was also noticeable in d ones as well.Due to this issue I overall felt a loss of immersion when playing the same game on the  it felt more dry and like I was just going through the control motions but had little to nothing emotionally invested in what was happening.  My mind felt subcontiously distracted by the detail loss in the backgrounds which in turn did not lend me to outing my full focus on the adventure I was playing and in the end I came away less engrossed with that particular play period.In the end I returned the  got my refund and have enjoyed my .,vita,cp713sh,1,t5_2sjmv

3532669,0,t3_30qx9x,Pretty sure that you cant do it all in one. Part of the joy is going back through new game plus and picking up the bits you may have missed. The second playthrough can go by much faster since youre able to change the parameters of the difficulty settings stuff like more money and experience. During the second playthrough youre better equiped to deal with things since stuff like understanding and courage and all of that carries over. Well in the end its worth it to get both endings so do what comes natural this time around and then go at it with guides and whatever during the second playthrough to streamline it and squeeze out the undiscovered sweet spots.,vita,cpuy5cq,-1,t5_2sjmv

3557946,0,t3_311ndi,gt It just seems like endless conversations between the high school students where I am pressing x to continue the story at this moment it feels more like an anime than a JRPG.Honestly I felt the same way when I first started playing the game. Two hours of cutscenes before I can play? Cmon! But the game does start to open up after ten hours or so. Youll have more freedom in how to spend your time and the Fox joins your party which lets you refill SP without leaving the dungeon. The plot starts to move forward too from the characters trying to figure out whats going on to actively trying to prevent it.That said the game is very storyheavy and those long cutscenes are there to stay. At some point the story and characters clicked with me and I found them more enjoyable than the bland dungeons. All I can say is stick with it for another dungeon or two and you may start to really enjoy it like I did.,vita,cpxtwga,2,t5_2sjmv

3575385,0,t3_319kzy,gtDoes crafting become more important?Yes yes it does in the later stages of the game especially since in the later ends of the game where youll be tasked with much harder quest such as fighting  Large Onis in under mins not multiplayer this is chapter quest and many more.gtDoes it become harder?YES! yes it does example is you and your friend already have end game armor doing end game quest normally it would be okay at this point but you couldnt be anymore wrong? the game emphasizes more on the combat than the crafting as even the strongest and heaviest armor ingame will just look like paper to the later EX stages.gtIs there MORE? I know its filled to the brim with content but is it mindless button mashing the entire game?YES a lot actually a lot of MITAMAs to collect and damn can that get tiresome a lot of Weapon trees to master a lot of Builds possible per weapon and per mitama class not really Toukiden mostly cant be button mashed unless your the gauntlet build but even that get dangerous if you dont time your attacks right the games combat really does pick up in the later stages since a lot of those WTF moments will also happen in the later stages the demo they gave was a bit too less content since the set you already have there is a good set the boss aint an EX boss iirc so it can become easy to spot the attack patterns of the boss from just a few fights.tldr YES theres more and no its not button mashy at all.,vita,cpztkuo,1,t5_2sjmv

Ive also had odd issues with a mostlyfull battery running out when the Vita is in sleep mode within a couple of hours I had assumed that this was because maybe something in my bag had been constantly pressing the button and waking the Vita from sleep mode at first which would run down the battery quicker. This issue is intermittent  the battery life is otherwise the same as usual i.e. days and days of battery when left in sleep mode when this doesnt happen.But as you can see there are many people out there that havent had these issues so I guess its up to you to decide whether the risk is worth it for PSN access D,vita,cq7mfg5,1,t5_2sjmv

Steinsgates official translation was released over a year ago JAST is working on titles like Shiny Days School Days prequel and Starless of the same creator of Bible Black right now and Mangagamer was branching out with titles like No Thank You!!! Boys Love Ozmafia!!! Otome a Steampunk game a Get Out While You Can piece by Clockup they released a Moege Princess Evangile they really dont seem to be treading into the genres FSN is in though.If anybody picks it up it will probably be Sekai Project who actually retranslates translated pieces and censors the hell out of them through things like Kickstarter. Mind you that Sekai is the publisher for the Winged Cloud series Sakura X Sakura Spirit Sakura Angels Sakura Fantasy with Sakura Beach or whatever on the way and so you cant really expect the FSN translation to be great if it happens. On top of that if Sekai picks it up I doubt it will get to ever be on any console just Steam.Thats the biggest problem with games that already have full translations no Visual Novel translation company of which there are only  unless you count MoeNovels which is a sister company to Pulltop and so it only translates their stuff and very censored except Sekai Project wants to touch previously translated pieces.,vita,cqfp6rh,2,t5_2sjmv

However the Vita  gives you more battery life and swaps the proprietary charging port for a micro USB port so you can use your phones charger to charge it.I guess it depends on what you prefer. For me the screen on the  is reason enough to hold on to it but the Vita  does have a svelte design and the battery lasts longer.,vita,cqfzzk8,2,t5_2sjmv

3728268,0,t3_333deo,Honestly it all depends on what games you like. Look through the catalogs of games for both systems and make lists of the games youd want to play then pick whichever one has more.For me DS had SMT IV Bravely Default Devil Survivor Overclocked Devil Survivor  RC Fire Emblem Awakening Pokemon Y Smash BrosWhile the Vita had The entire Persona series the entire Disgaea series Gravity Rush Tales of Hearts R Danganronpa  Danganronpa  Freedom Wars Oreshika Toukiden Final Fantasy XX HD Demon Gaze Muramasa Rebirth Metal Gear Solid  HD Sly Cooper Collection Sly Cooper  Neptunia series Atelier series Steins Gate Blazblue Borderlands  Uncharted Killzone Ys Memories of CelcetaTheres more for each list but thats all I can remember for now but the point is the Vita had more games that interested me.

3736715,0,t1_cqhovom,The story is good and the gameplay is fun. It is a little repetitive but if you are looking for a game where you beat up a bunch of enemies then you are probably expecting that. It is really fun and there are tons of unlockables and dlc costumes if you are into that. But underneath the jiggle there is a solid game.

But I understand thats highly unlikely.

The puzzle is unsolvable.  And because the trophy list is measly and it throws the first couple at you I was already at gt of the trophy progress before I came across this which was a matter of less than half an hour btw which puts me past the threshold of Sonys refund eligibility.  To make it perhaps worse I come here and find that the developer has commented and doesnt actually acknowledge that there are unsolvable puzzles but rather says if there is a puzzle that is too hard. Unsolvable isnt too hard its unsolvable.  Well I hope you enjoy my  Spiky Fish.,vita,crej98j,1,t5_2sjmv

4046827,0,t3_36vv2j,. Translations not great and Im in the same position you are in with regards to the show. The games alright. If you can wait to get it on sale do that.. Atelier games are fantastic but they are less of JRPGs and more of turn management games. Its really stressful honestly and it makes it difficult for me to want to pick them up after starting. There is continuity between the trilogy but its not super important.. I didnt get far in the Firefly Diary because of the controls. Its a pain in the ass to play.. Demon Gaze is fantastic and pretty easy by genre standards.. Great game.. Its worth  sure but it isnt fantastic. Its kind of confusing and plays itself unless you choose to dive into the mechanics and dont choose the default difficulty level.. I love Criminal Girls. Lewd elements are dumb repetitive and shameful but the rest of the experience is fantastic.. Muramasa is great. DLC is great too.. Its OK. Theres a whole lot of yuri in it but yknow. The actual play is a pretty buttonmashy beatemup. I bought it on launch for the limited edition box but I dont like the game very much.. Toukiden is a much better game than SS or FW in my opinion.

4071020,0,t1_crkabzv,More endings some variations on a normal ending based on your shares one extremely dark and potentially traumatic ending and two quite inspiring ones that actually make use of your Lily Ranks. If youve played ReBirth a conversation between Nep and Noire directly references the traumatic one. On the upside this ending really cant be achieved on accident.Theres a lot more focus on the characters growth in this one amidst the satire which is nice. Some extra fanservice events too.A lot of people dont like the fact that the battle system is basically the exact same as ReBirth but they also neglect the fact that these are remakes and Compile Heart already had three games under their belts to develop and make the combat in the series what it is now and they improved it even further with VII on the PS.The main characters are changed up too with the majority of the game being centered around the younger sisters of the CPUs called the CPU Candidates. These are The Complete Opposite of Neptune Nepgear Pictured Nepgear amp Vert. Not pictured Nepgear being sane. The Inferiority Complex Tsundere and Sister of Lonely Heart Black Heart Uni The Lovely Lowee Lolis Rom amp Ram Im probably on a list now arent I?Along with the returning CPUs of ReBirth which you get to add to your party later into the game new side characters include The Danmaku Aficionado Cave The Bipolar Popstar pb The Mage from Another Dimension MAGES. Yes you have to pronounce it with the period. The Waifu Hunter and Indisputable Best Girl RedYes Iffy is back tootldr if you liked ReBirth get this.,vita,crkbnu2,3,t5_2sjmv

4105859,0,t3_37n7a5,My favorite game of all time has gotta be The Legend of Zelda The Minish Cap on GBA. When I was younger we didnt really have home game consoles at all so I had to rely on my trusty old GBA to give me quality gaming experiences and by golly that game had it all! A decent story for a Zelda game kickass items fantastic gameplay and even enjoyable sidequests! The Kinstones was a pretty cool mechanic as well.Bonus When I was about  my family took a trip to Texas. While taking a bus to get to the airport we chose to sit in the back of the bus. Now the bus had chairs all the way across the back so there was a seat in the middle of the aisle. Before the bus had stopped my mom gave me money to give to the driver as a tip. However the driver slammed on the breaks which launched me out of the chair. I slid all the way to the front of the bus with tip in hand. As I was sliding my dad was chasing me down the length of the bus. Once I finally stopped I got up handed the driver the tip and walked off the bus with my mom and dad.THE END,vita,croajmb,1,t5_2sjmv

4111210,0,t3_37n7a5,Honestly My favorite game of all time would probably be Persona  Portable a long time ago or what feels like a long time ago i tried to play through persona  fes on the ps i was like  and didnt get the game the enemies were boring looking and killed me way too much and i though id never try to play another SMT game period. Then about my junior year of high school I picked up PP since i was having a very difficult time socially and really only had  friend who at the time and just hurt me pretty bad dont really want to go into the unrelated bits and from everything i heard PP was a JRPG Visual novel with the best social aspect of any Game and even better than many visual novels. And that was true I played through my first playthrough social linking with just the characters I liked then grinding just to make their ultimate persona the story captivated me and felt a lot more real. I decided to NG it on the hardest difficulty and went for all the social links didnt use a guide ended up with all of them maxed except Tanaka stupid devil social link xp beat the game and damn it was still hard even with a level  messiah. NG again and lowered the difficulty back to normal and played through the female protagonist story its amazing how they managed to add a second gender for the protagonist that despite not changing the main story still feels like a completely different game. Ultimately the game helped me get through a very difficult time in my life and made me appreciate SMT but also games that are more about the story than just action shooters and such. With the combined hours of my  main playthroughs my Female MC is most of the way through the game with almost all the social links done and at around  hours. Thanks for reading.,vita,crowj4w,1,t5_2sjmv

Im done with you.Second my new job has me doing a bit of travel. Playing games on the iPhone and iPad are nice but theres something about physical buttons that makes games more playable. I saw the advertising about being the companion to the PS and thought that this might be good when I get a PS. Third even though I didnt have a Vita Ive been buying the free PS games as they came out. I knew I had a good collection of games waiting for me.

When the PSP and DS were first released a bunch of people bought them but a huge share of the market was small kids. I mean I got a gameboy pocket around  and it wasnt uncommon to see a  year old with a DS or a psp. But times have changed now a lot of the current people under  from about the age of  and up it was much easier for a parent to hand them their smart phone and let them play a game and much much cheaper as well. So Now a good chunk of current kids have played the majority of their games on smart phones growing up so all they want is a tablet or smart phone which the parent can then buy them and its still cheaper than a portable game system. A huge if not the previously biggest chunk of the portable gaming market has moved on to ios and android because at  and  most of them dont care to much about how things look they just want to play a game with their friends.,vita,csarwuu,1,t5_2sjmv

Also you might be able to buy physical cheaper for it. Also only good if you like the cute charactersAr nosurge plus not really able to buy physical anymore short of ebay scalpers as they only released LE physical editions in USA. Its kinda a crafting atelier and VN game. Looks like theres a fair amount of lewd as well. Im kinda biased since I want Gust to bring over Ciel Nosurge and you buying it brings it closer to localization but if Ar nosurge looks interesting to you maybe give it a go.,vita,csx4uby,1,t5_2sjmv

4587809,0,t1_ct8twk6,I actually disagree with the complexity of the relationship system in SAO. If youre playing it in English most of the complexity of the relationship system comes out of not being able to understand what theyre talking about. The girls will ask you dumb stuff that dont make any sense in English like in this video  . Of course theyll end up asking the same  or so questions over and over again and the complexity comes from remembering which one of two responses you give that will make her happy. The same holds half true for battle feedback. You have to guess what they mean when they ask for battle feedback.All in all anything outside of the main quest dialogue in SAO is pretty horribly translated. I would look at gameplay videos especially of the noncombat parts to see if youre really able to stand the terrible translation which even encompasses the game tutorial.,vita,ct8w369,2,t5_2sjmv

4663682,0,t3_3etcdt,IMO Freedom Wars.FWs story is crap dont get me wrong. But I dont have to enjoy its pish posh story to enjoy its gameplay. FW offers quite a lot of fun for me sure its got a limited set of maps to play in but the difficulty spikes always kept me entertained to beating the story and beyond. It offers quite an array of weapons with cool effects phenomenal verticality but most importantly that friggen whip. There is just something about using that whip to cling to the top of a map accelerate around andor and the most satisfying cling to an abductor. I also didnt feel the lategame weapon upgrading was as frustrating as others have voiced. I truly enjoyed that game and for  you can do no wrong with it. Just change the controls away from default IMO.SS on the otherhand I got free through PS and no matter how hard I tried to get into it just failed to do so. It is honestly the one game on this subreddit where I have to disagree with everyone. If youre a fan of having to read up on lore on your own this might be up your alley. This game was slow for me and within  hours I was bored. I tried putting up to ten hours into this game and decided I could put no more. The combat is not worth it to me id argue it feels slow motion compared to freedom wars and the abilities used to attack are far from satisfying. I found myself just scrolling through what small interjections it used to introduce each mission because they were not entertaining to sit throughfelt like a chore.That being said this subreddit heralds both games. Both games obviously have something going for them or they wouldnt be as talked about as they are I actually think saying this qualifies as a logical fallacy but I dont care. Pick what you fancy hope it works out and play what you enjoy friend. I highly suggest you google some videos of the combat in both games and choose the one that most tickles your fancy.,vita,ctiev3h,4,t5_2sjmv

4678211,0,t3_3ezrl1,As a long time fan of Trails it really pleases me to know Xseed successfully localized this Masterpiece of a JRPG. I played the Chinese version clocked over  hours on each game without much of a grind so in the end yes the hype is worth it.Before we start however please make a point to buy Legend of Heroes FC now on Steam and PSN Store and the soon to be released SC. Their stories are fantastic and does a lot to build the world of Trails. And becoming Falcom expect self references from prior game to reach current game. What is the Game like Falcom truly went out the door with the details. I would almost compare Trails to a Family version of George Martins A Song of Fire and Ice. Each nation of the continent is detailed with a rich history even down to the NPCs. A merchant you met in Game A at each chapter of the story he might have met a girl got rejected met a partner start a businessthen you find him again in a separate game on business. The detail is intense and the NPCs felt alive. So if you are looking to move away from the standard  grind and some stories tacked on a la monster hunter and move to a  grind  story this title is for you even if you might not be a JRPG fan. What is the World like The game take place on the continent of Zumeria sicand please pardon my misspelling of names it is mostly European World War I level tech with some notable exceptions Like Huge Skyships alaFinal Fantasy in the trailers. There was a big dark agecollapse centuries ago so people are now rediscovering Magic and High Tech. In term of Magic unlike your classic RPG magic that involve buying a book to master elderich powers everyone have a Watch that let them modify with Quartz to cast spells. So Magic  Technology generated effects.  However you still need to be able to attune to such a watch Oh a interesting note there is also a Catholic Church of Aidos. They are actually fairly progressive. How does this perform on Vita I would say it is very optimized. Even very large areas such as the capital city or huge wilderness areas I experienced zero frame rate drop and the loading time hits maybe  second max and almost  going to storehuts. This is definitely several time better than say..Final FantasyX with their infamous  second huts. What is the gameplay likeI think the closest game I played would be Persona . Like Persona you meet your classmates become their friends and thus raise your combat capabilities. Better friendships  Better battles. However unlike Persona  The game will be more canned experience than Persona. So while Persona would give you a full year of school days Cold Steel will give you only  days a month but frontload them with events. So instead hearing generic NPCkun telling you she is scared of the fog for  days straight Cold Steel will make sure she say something different each time you met her.  to  days a month? Is it worth it?Yes those  days are fairly action packed. It goes something like this LecturegtAfter school eventgtDorm night eventgt Saturday freeday in which you do quests for the townDungeon Crawlgt Next Wed field examgtField trip to various part of the empiregt rinse repeat until the story climax. How many PCs can I play with? A lot a blood a lot. without spoiling certainly all the way to double digits. But dont worry Falcom made sure all of them are very well written with their own storyline and personalities enterleave your party as the story progress and they upgrade their own gears Always best  so you dont have to grind to keep them updated. What is combat likeGridTurn based combat. Unlike classic FFs three man standing in a line Trails offer you an additional function to move. Very important when the boss cast a huge AOE and you couldnt interrupt. Also did I mention there is no random combat? You will see the enemy diving for you but you can run away or stun them. No invisible Dragon in a  x  room here  Will there be waifus? Yes. But dont expect much in the fan service. Trails is serious business. ,vita,ctk8ja9,1,t5_2sjmv

I would definitely include the import puzzle game Puyo Puyo Tetris. For RPGs Oreshika Tainted Bloodlines is a unique title definitely worth checking out. And in the world of kart racers Sonic Racing Transformed is a surprisingly very solid title. I also always recommend the platformer Sound Shapes as it is my favorite quick pickupandplay type of game.

4935273,0,t1_cuge08z,I felt let down by DR. I think DR was a more successful game overall.DR captured a real feeling of foreboding danger and despair. DR is tonally all over the place. Most of the time its cartoonishly over the top and loaded with irrelevant humor. Which is not objectively a bad thing but I think it eroded the suspense of the setting.I also did not like any of the revised trial mini games in DR but thats entirely a matter of taste.The mysteries in DR are more elaborate so thats nice. But I think the storytelling was weaker.There were a couple characters I really liked in DR. Props there.More than anything the finale felt really sloppy to me. The most interesting character steps out of the picture after teasing a larger involvement in the story. Certain characters show up for the ending in a way that felt forced. The true threat behind it all did not make me happy thought it was a very lazy plot device.Apart from all that Island Mode and the Monomi minigame soured the experience for me but thats mostly my fault. Those modes are stupid filler that should just be ignored but I was at the time very interested in getting the Platinum trophy.

If jot open the back remove the the battery and rinse the whole thing off with distilled water to remove the urine.

5244910,0,t1_cvi4rkv,gtNo one is buying an Android or iPad because of XCom or some other largescale game I would bet a lot of money on that.Of course not. The whole reason its a disruptive platform is that they dont need games to drive platform sales. The platforms are selling themselves. The games are ancillary. In other words they arent buying an android or iPad for Candy Crush either. Theyre buying an android or iPad to own an iPad or Android.The key is that once they have that tablet or phone they now own a platform for cheaper games which makes the job of selling a dedicated handheld device that much more difficult. Why would I spend money on a handheld for an experience if the platform I already own for other reasons will provide an equivalent experience?Now obviously theyre not identical experiences which is why the Vita is still out there as well as the DS but its crazy to think that the market hasnt been critically impacted by this. Its obviously similar enough for not only an older audience but for a very young audience that is growing up with touch controls and mobile design as the norm not the new thing. Its also silly to argue that its solely due to casual candy crush type games. Go to the top  paid apps in iTunes and while its not dominating the market you have multiple Grand Theft Auto games multiple Five Nights at Freddies games a Sims Minecraft Terreria Scribblenauts and Goat Simulator all on the list. Whether you like it or not plenty of people are playing games that are far more complex than your average candy crush on their mobile devices and theyre enjoying it.gtAgain you are not getting the experience without actual proper buttons. Youre just not.Speak for yourself all you want but dont try to pass it off as objective in any way. Ive personally spent the past few days playing XCOM on my phone and its felt no different than when I first got it on PC. The interface is different but the gameplay experience is the same.Ultimately its silly to even try to distinguish between the two at this point because the experience will be so subjective to each person. Theres an entire generation of kids out there right now that are growing up with games like Minecraft and Terreria on a strictly touchbased control system that couldnt care less about modern JRPGs or buttons. ,vita,cvi78rd,1,t5_2sjmv

5335773,0,t1_cvtnlnv,activating flames of passionDanganronpaDR features a lot of gameplay which makes it a good gateway into the VN genre imho I started with Ace Attorney before moving on to the classic lowinteractive titles. If you take a look at this VN recommendation chart  you will see it listed under the Gameplay row at the nd spot with a good summary.The first thing you should know is that DR fuses comedicwacky dialogues with a dark plot battle royale in an enclosed setting which works surprisingly well. Since you already played Persona  Golden the Japanese atmosphere should feel familiar to you. Gameplay follows a mostly straight pattern  explore school advancing the plot Social Linkesque section with your stillalive classmates  someone gets murdered investigation gather evidence interactive class trial to pin down the murderer the best part! murderer gets executed next chapterThe murder mysteries start out easy but they become progressively harder and more elaborated. Danganronpa  in particular is a major upgrade in this regard. The story is very engaging and leaves you guessing how the students wound up in this twisted lifeordeath game it plays off nicely the closer you get to the ending.You should definitely follow the release schedule of the DR games as the sequels spoil the prequels. This meansDR gt DR gt DR Another EpisodeLast thing to note do NOT google anything Danganronparelated until you finished DR and DR. Its perhaps the most easily spoiled VN series which is quite a shame. Any questions are best answered on the visual novels subreddit.Final Fantasy XIts my favorite JRPG since it combines a great plot with good graphics sympathetic characters solid combat system and excellent OST. FF X is more Asianinfluenced than the other titles and conveys the story of a great pilgrimage. Some view the main character Tidus as whiny and annoying but I found him to be genuinely entertaining and relateable. The dynamic between Tidus and Yuna the games female lead in particular is one of my favorite aspects.The combat system is entirely turnbased and follows a set order at the start. You can influence this order with different abilities which push your next action either closer or farther away. There are also the classic time spells Haste and Slow. Character progression is settled with ability points  spheres gained by defeating enemies on the Sphere Grid. There are nodes on this grid which either increase attributes or unlock a spellability. If you choose the Classic Grid then each character has a largely linear path through his board section to lock him into a archetypical class basically. Endgame provides you with key spheres to break out of this setup to maximize stats.FF X is the first mainline title with a more linear approach but thats not really a bad point imho. There are a few minigames like Blitzball underwater football with attributes and abilities which provide a good distraction with worthwhile rewards. Its a great allaround package and also a wonderful entry into the FF series.,vita,cvtpcvd,5,t5_2sjmv

Hatreds still a shitty game entirely built around controversy to mask its lack of substance either way. The end result is an example of when people buy things just because of the suggestion that someone doesnt want them to.Valve chooses what kinds of games get on Steam all the time. They were under no compulsion to accept Hatred over any number of games they regularly block from their service. Free speech does not mean an obligation for a given service to give you a platform.Australias been heavily restrictive on games and their classifications before the term SJW was even a thing.And the Hotline Miami  opening could do with closer examination. Its a pretty clear scene of implied sexual violence but it serves no point. It doesnt drive the narrative and its never brought up again. Adding a toggle to disable that kind of content only highlights this further as its the only scene affected by it.

Even if the Vita used sensible memory cards had decent marketing and actual third party support it wouldnt have set the world on fire.

To me after reading a bunch of stuff it feels like Extra Credits is really just an advertisement for their real job which is the consulting company. I never even noticed how often they mentioned it until you brought things up. Youre right they do make it seem like hes consultedworked on FAR more games than his resume actually reflects. They still have some decent ideas that I like like their ideas on ethical game design. Basically that companies should be focussing on making a game as fun as possible instead of using addiction based design decisions taken from gambling to drain the whales pockets with microtransactions. That I can get behind and support for sure. Its kind of a shame... If they were honest about how many projects they are actually involved in their ideas would still stand on their own but because the exaggerate they end up looking a little foolish.

The Atelier Series might be a good choice I havent played them myself but it looks cutesy and you play a female protagonist same with Child of Light and htolNiQ The Firefly Diary.

6108312,0,t3_3z8164,So I saw a video on YouTube where he had these Xbox one analog stick extensions to his vita and I was like that looks easy ordered the parts to make them. I just cut of the top of a ps stick and dremled underneath it to get a dome shape. Then I epoxied it to some silicon analog covers I got from eBay.

6229662,0,t1_cyxpp1s,For me the most important thing is how well the game will perform on the Vita. Titan Souls for example. The look and feel of it on the Vita are great and I loved it  but the load times were for whatever reason I dont know unbearable. I have no idea if that was because of the Vitas hardware though I doubt it or if it was because of the engine the game used or if it was just a poorly programmed game.  But if devs run into similar problems optimizing games to work well on the Vita I guess it would make sense that in some cases they would choose to save the time and money and cancel the Vita port. ,vita,cyxqtk9,3,t5_2sjmv

6245374,0,t1_cyzi6xv,For the consumer arent more ports always better? I suppose it could weaken the viability of a system that you like. And if some platforms languish due to an overabundance of consumer choice it could actually hurt diversity and choice in the long run...Hmmmm!But if a game like Neptunia for example can get a second wind of profitability in the West by porting to PC I think it means more games like that will be made and localized.,vita,cyzj4tc,1,t5_2sjmv

6291772,0,t1_cz4oip1,To be fair it is hard to tell at a glance where the title divides itself if you never heard of the game beforehand.gt  Root Double Before Crime  After Days Xtend Edition Root Double Either a series name or the main title with the rest being a subtitle. Before Crime  After Days. Either the asterisk is a symbol they stuck in the logo for marketing reasons or it is a divider between title and subtitle. Xtend Edition Denotes some flavour of limited edition physical release.And MuvLuv isnt a ridiculous title. Its short easy to pronounce and reasonable easy to remember. At least it avoids the omnipresent problem of content creators in Japan making extremely long titles which are basically sentences as the official name and then using it to make some nonsensical shorthand. This is especially bad as the full titles are generally unintelligible if you dont know Japanese and having a nonobvious shorthand name makes searching even harder.,vita,cz4sy17,3,t5_2sjmv

6585340,0,t3_45tqpv,Its virtually impossible to complete everything in the game on one playthrough. Though there are guides for it but it involves having maybe one days leeway.As people have said the game does have an excellent NG feature. Your social stats Diligence Academics etc all carry over so you dont have to spend time working on those. When you get access to your Persona Compendium that is carried over as well so with some money you can get back your high powered personas. I believe that items and some levels might carry over but its been a while and I dont remember.As for the multiple endings front you can see all of them in one playthrough though looking up how to see each of them can be a minor spoiler in three cases and one involves a pretty massive spoiler. Theres four endings total not counting a standard sort of badend when you dont save one of the characters in time. Two of them are only psuedoendings as they end the game earlier than intended because youve basically incorrectly solved the murder case.,vita,d00h85c,2,t5_2sjmv

Use Carl mask which gives you  points for each execution you do with drill  person should be laying flat. . Use Don Juan which gives you  points for each execution in sitting position. Or . Use Zack and get great combos though I found that option most difficult.,vita,d0bsbq9,1,t5_2sjmv

6701623,0,t3_47fbrj,A cheap way to experience Vita games is a PS TV but it does lack the portability youre looking for. It also lacks complete compatibility. However having a PS may remedy that a bit seeing as Persona  Golden is playable on PS TV.If youre going to get a Vita then theres quite a few colors available if youre willing to import. Otherwise youve got to choose between the OLED version and the Slim. Most people are partial to the newer Slim model due to its lighter weight and better battery life but others love their OLED screen.As for whether it is worth it or not well thats up to you to decide but I can say that there are some amazing games for both handhelds.

Also it will be a slightly different game open world likely with focus on the PS so Id wait to see how the vita version performs.Later this year God Eater Resurrection and God Eater  Rage Burst will come out these are two good hunting type action games as well less close to monster hunter though.For anything further you need to tell us your preferences its hard to recommend games without knowing what someones likes or already has played.,vita,d0t8aou,1,t5_2sjmv

6906806,0,t3_4abxe5,I played it through remote play from my PS to my vita. Its not a bad version of the game at all. The only issues i have with the stand alone version for the vita is that theres no cross play. It would be a no brainier for me if i could play a world on my vita when i am out and when i get home sink it up to my PS. And the other way around.If you dont own a PS or are out and about a lot i would pick it up for the vita. Its WAY better then a mobile version. But if you own a PS and are home enough to play it. I would just pick it up on that. So you can still remote play it around the house.Take a look at terraria. Its the same kind of game as minecraft just D and A LOT more stuff to kill like bosses and events. But you can cross play. I played it for quite some time on my vita and then picked it up on my PS. With only a few hits on a button and you can switch back and forth.I would also take a look at dont starve. Its fun and a little easier to play on a vita. ,vita,d0z7f4q,1,t5_2sjmv

6958992,0,t3_4ayk2x,Well I think one of the obvious recommendations for Actionadventure on the Vita is Uncharted Golden Abyss.

Im very impressed with performance. Here are a few anecdotesGod of War Ascension being an intensive game seems to hiccup on occasion but is playable. The Wolf Among Us I found was not very playable due to input lag and the games performance. Ultra Street Fighter IV and Street Fighter III rd Strike were totally playable for me and no noticeable input lag. I was surprised a fighting game did so well on Now. Every other game I tried Bound by Flame Tokyo Twilight Ghost Hunters Bioshock Infinite handled as if they were Remote Play to my PS. Great quality and responsiveness.

7192748,0,t3_4dvrvi,I havent played Ridge Racer MXGP F and a few others but I will say that if youre into fun fast kart racers  Sonic is the way to go! Such a fun game and I was never a big Sonic fan. Its like a modern day Crash Team Racing minus the super fun Adventure mode. Speaking of  CTR works great on the Vita!NFS isnt wholly my cup of tea but it is a superb port of a pretty good racer.Wipeout  is another great choice as people have already discussed in this thread.In my opinion you cant go wrong with either of these games. Gran Turismo PSP also works great on Vita if youre looking for something more serious. Enjoy!,vita,d1vr7ye,1,t5_2sjmv

I contacted sony customer service and they told me that I needed to send it in for repairs. So long as its within a year of purchase and you have your receipt it will be free to you... You just have to go without the Vita for a couple of weeks. Now for a more in depth description of my issue. At first it was saying the same thing you removed your memory card. Then it stopped loading games. I tried every single game I had and nothing worked. So then I formatted the card and reset the system. Once I did that I downloaded a game and tried again. Still wouldnt load. Thats when I called Sony. As I was talking to the CSR she was talking me through another the same solution and then the apps wouldnt load. Even system settings would not open. I was pretty pissed off but she was awesome about it. She sent me a box with a shipping label. I still havent been able to get mine shipped yet though for lack of FedEx stores in my area.Anyway I hope this helps you get a jump on the issue. I also hope that you actually dont have the same problem as me but personally I would call Sony first before you spend more money.,vita,d27f13h,2,t5_2sjmv

7373981,0,t1_d2g1hpx,Hi just thought I would add that the Vita version of NT is well and truly broken  in that it suffers constant crashes on particular stages which have never been fixed. Dreadful if you bear in mind this is a game which basically exists to make you top your best score.  It doesnt record your highest scores because it crashes on death at the later stages. The devs have claimed its going to be fixed I believe ps suffers the same thing but it hasnt. And the games been out for nigh on  months.  Not good enough if you ask me.  Worse because its such a good game that it makes you really really want to play it but then it annoys the hell out of you when you realise you cant. Plus you unlock things and cant even use them because of some other bug which is less annoying but still lame.  They need to fix it.  You spend  quid on a game and its broken.

Whether theyre good games depends on the location. You could look at the lack of marketing the Vita Sonys attempt to create a rival for the DS and DS as well as the price to create Vita cartridges and surmise something from it. But IMO I dont think the Vita market in North America is weak. Compared to other Vita markets I think its extremely strong. What makes it seem weak is perhaps the demographics of rvita and reddit in general mainly from the US. If something is not available in the NA store therell be posts and complaints especially in regards to digital and physical copies yet if its not available in the European store youd be lucky to get posts about it.

8105954,0,t1_d4r3ajv,RB has Blood Arts and BR GER has the devour mehanic everything else that isnt important you can find on the wiki. Resurrection clearly has less enemies its a remake of the first game after all with the only GER exclusive enemies being the Mata and Pita remakes and both new and original Novas. All of the weapon types from GE and GERB have hardly any gear on GER while all the old tyoes still have the same amount.Just imagine RB with over x the amount of everything but the character creation options that GER has. It blows GER out of the water in every way but GER having smoother gameplay. So if you like GER get GERB.For those of you that dont know or was told otherwiseYou do not need to play GER to understand GEs stor even the main cast is different. Theyre  unrelated with simply a few references and returning characters that have their own character episodes which have nothing to do with the plot.If someone told you that you have to play GER to understand GERBThey dont have both games.

So right now Im patiently waiting for Sony to complete their second review of my case.I say all of that to say this. When you talk to customer service document everything!

8559106,0,t3_4wzwj1,Final Fantasy Tactics War of the Lions is amazing. Im seconding that one. Id also recommend Persona  Portable. It isnt as polished as  but it has a darker theme. The Tales of series is pretty solid as far as JRPGs go but Tales of Hearts R is the only one playable on the Vita unless Im missing some PSP game and Ive not played it yet.JRPGs as a genre tend to be focused on telling a story and not on being able to do anything in a sandbox world. I think they take a lot of often unfair criticism because they arent The Elder Scrolls. Theyre more deliberate I would say and you can see that reflected in the popularity of turnbased battle systems.If you can find a way to play a Phantasy Star game those are usually pretty actiony. Phantasy Star Portable  got pulled from the store....,vita,d6bgqzx,3,t5_2sjmv

8686102,0,t1_d6qp6lg,Yeah typically when people say something is censored is when the games themselves are changed from their Japanese release to their western release e.g Nintendo games most of them so if a certain product was already a certain way in Japan its not really considered censored.Also ironically CERO the rating board of Japan does NOT allow nudity while the western boards DO allow nudity nipples I just find that funny because Japan is the country that has the more sexualized games and yet allows less sex. Our western boards allow pretty much anything when peoplecompanies blame them for game changes its complete bullshit.,vita,d6re15q,1,t5_2sjmv

8954553,0,t3_52xnnw,This isnt really a problem because unfortunately fighting games have been in decline for a while now. A big part of this is because the latest Street Fighter games have been panned  SF is easily the marquee brand for fighting games  but the largest reason is because the fighting game audience failed to grow even after SF. If you were  when SF came out you would be  today and youre not going to spend your free time practicing video games.The other issue is that many fighting games have an autocombo feature now  you hit A A A A and thats a combo. King of Fighters  is the latest game with this feature  that series is just about as old as SF so if they feel like they have to make concessions to newbies the genre is on its last legs.Its interesting that you admit to rage quitting in the past  I always thought only casual players did that. I was actually trying to get in some SF x Tekken matches last night there was barely anyone on but when I finally got matched with a player dude had a whopping  disconnection rate! I just shook my head and bounced. Selfishly I dont mind fighting games dying out because Im older now too and dont want to spend all my time practicing.

If it has adhoc i will buy two copies for me and my wife otherwise not.I do not really need suggestions for alternatives I just have two copies of Tetris for about  each sitting in my shopping cart and need help deciding if its worth buying them for the adhoc. I know that I could order them and send them back but  taking the  shipping time of about two months into account I just dont want to.

9216374,0,t1_d8jby2m,Ive never been credited and Ive contacted support about their shipping on several occasions. I bought Prime at one point as one of the support folks built it up to be something that would solve all my shipping issues. Realistically it did nothing for me day shipping just means the packages get here faster they dont actually get shipped out any sooner and I was already receiving packages within  hours of them shipping with the free shipping method as long as the items were shipping from Mississauga and not BC. They typically didnt ship my preorders until a day after release at the earliest meaning I generally would have been better off just going to the local EB Games I cant stand the store and try to avoid it whenever possible. Ive taken my money to VGP and havent looked back I typically get things from them the week before release. I will admit I still have a few preorders through Amazon.ca from some of the E deals theyve had but theyre games I really dont care about getting on launch day and are Collectors Editions that VGP does not have listed for preorder yet. Ironically I got DOOM for the Xbox One a day early from Amazon.ca though it was something I intended to cancel but forgot as I grabbed the PC version instead beta showed me my PC was more than capable of running it. I already had it back in the mail as a return within  min of receiving it. It makes me sad though I used to absolutely love Amazon they used to always ship my items quickly games used to be shipped before release getting here on release day but that was  years ago at least I havent had the same level of service for a long time maybe Im just unlucky with them but they essentially lost a longtime customer for game purchases anyway over it.,vita,d8k8s58,1,t5_2sjmv

9233074,0,t1_d8m7v7d,Yes I agree with this. However the ESRB takes anything in the realm of nudity or sex acts pretty harshly. If you can find an M rated game that is similar to the uncensored version of these games I would love to see it. The Hot Coffee incident alone made GTASA an AO game for a short time. It was then removed from retailers shelves until a patched version was released. Both xSeed and PQube games that saw US releases are rated mature GalGun while similar in tone does not have you discipliningmotivating. Any simulated sex act will get an automatic AO. While I dont have a source I have enough AO games and enough games that were cleaned up for ESRB to form a results oriented conclusion.If not to avoid ESRB rating what is the reasoning for spending costly extra dev time to rework and reskin? Even if it is to avoid back lash in the US the the decision is still money based and selling to the widest audience. Also did not get a chance to peep out your link. Ill give it a look when I have more time and respond if any change of thought occurs. Thanks for including additional insight. ,vita,d8mcyl9,4,t5_2sjmv

9341464,0,t1_d8zzmgv,YES!I partly blame the Vita communitys and the gaming medias negativity towards the slim for the low sales. Muh superior OLED!!! LOOK AT THE CRISP COLORS! Who needs a slim?! Holy shit even to this day people give potential new Vita owners the advice to buy a used OLED model instead of getting a perfectly fine new LCD model acting like the slim has some kind of  Tamagotchiquality screen. How do these Vita fans expect good sales for the system if they are the ones  who discourage potential new owners from buying the only version thats available in stores? This OLED elitism is stupid. ,vita,d903jdh,7,t5_2sjmv
9341571,0,t1_d8zz2oc,gt hopefully the third chapter will eventually come to VitaIt wont xseed already have said that Falcom has no interest in supporting any PSP games anymore. And xseed would need Falcoms support for bringing the rd chapter to the west.There are Vita remakes of all three chapters called Trails in the Sky ltchaptergt Evolution but they said they wont release them either. One of the new features for them is they are fully voiced for the main cast and they wouldnt be able to licence the voices for the west but doing a full dub would also be too expensive and they didnt want to release an incomplete version.Note that the PC releases are based on the PSP versions not the Vita remakes.,vita,d9040vq,2,t5_2sjmv

9529238,0,t1_d9njjm1,Well I think it depends how in demand something is. I just bought a game that was on sale and over heard some mother coming to pickup a preorder for some games she ordered but they had only recieved one copy of the game when she preordered two. they asked if she wanted the first one or if she wanted to wait until both came is so Im guessing theyll request stock from another store if someone doesnt pick theirs up. I think that also is based off your EB world level and the higher the level the longer theyll hold your preorder before allowing the stock to be sold to non preorderers.  Of course they could just cancel it as well. ,vita,d9noh4b,1,t5_2sjmv

Buttons  click all the buttons power volume updown directional pad PS ox start select L bumper R bumper. Make sure they all feel clicky and dont stick.  Sticks  give them a quick  . Both clockwise and counter to get a feel.  Test a game  whether you have to bring one or one come in the deal you can use it for two purposes the first being to make sure the card reader works and that the cart will enter and release as intended the second being that you can test all the buttons out in game. Primarily the sticks because of issues with drifting. Battery  ensure it charges and powers onoff without issue.  Settings  firmware memory card shows correct data etc.You can do all of those fairly quick and still ensure you are getting what youre paying for. ,vita,dayc08a,5,t5_2sjmv

To beat their initial story each dlc will probably run you like minutes per character but then if you wanna  each one you basically ahve to play through the entire vanilla games content with each one too you end up with as much playing in the DLC as you had in the Vanilla game if you go for  completion.And all  of the characters are varied and different to play with unlike the  main protags who were basically identical.

10095884,0,t1_dbn74mb,Just go jump in here I think the game looks fine. Its not jaggy. The renders look smooth and I think vita gamers should take that as a win. In my experience in the community two things of note. I feel that vita players or rather vita critical users would find a sloppy frame rate far far worse and unacceptable than a good frame rate like what we have here with a visual presentation and load times that arent at  system capability. I think its also an unfortunately good example of the notion that naysayers will always find something to complain about. Frame drops?  They complain about that. We find a vita version that actually runs great? They find something else they would never have mentioned before and complain about that instead. Considering some of the more recent multiplat games on the vita that the Devs didnt seem to give two rats about the vita version running well or looking well World of FF Hollow Realization I think this is coming out rather well. Especially since we didnt even get the last Valkyria game VC. ,vita,dbnibi2,2,t5_2sjmv

He used an example of how we have Jelly Beans in fairly smallish bags like  beans but in Japan they prefer more individual sizes so they had to create the super tiny bags like  beans. Looking at the Japanese market seems like what gaming was like growing up in the s and s.

I would definitely take into consideration a couple of things when deciding between a Vita and PS How often will you be away from home or at least away from your TV and able to play video games? If you spend most of your time gaming at home close to your TV then a handheld may not be as great though the PS Vita has the advantage you can pick up a cheap PSTV with it and play the games on handheld and TV. Exclusive titles. Generally when I consider buying a new system I will make a wishlist of every game on that system that I have some interest in playing... it doesnt have to be exhaustive you probably wont know EVERY game. Then I will research whether or not a game I really like is exclusive to that system or cross platform. An easy way to to this in most cases is to use Wikipedia which will tell you what systems a game is released for except for a few more obscure titles or new indies. Then you can make your decision based off which console has more exclusive games you really want to play.,vita,dcj9pp4,3,t5_2sjmv

As if he sold it not because he wanted some funds for the wedding but because he was now married and the wife said no more games.And to your last paragraph I have to wonder if you could call them the greatest deals ever because technically the VITA is still alive over there. In saying that what I mean is that there isnt a scarcity of games consoles or memory cards that drive up the price of said items. So value wouldnt be placed extremely high or people wouldnt sell their items for high prices when you could still go to a shop and by a system or those games.

10687559,0,t1_ddi4suu,It costs me  for one Vita game most of which are tiny digital games on a cart and it takes a month to arrive. Because of their refusal to update their archaic system I once paid  in one day for shipping for two orders that were made mere hours between eachother Black Friday deals  Stealth Inc. Im grateful for what they do but it reeks of amateurism. Every criticism is met with stop were a small company! They spent a month hyping up their new combined shipping system. When they finally deployed it it was a hideously convoluted system and they tucked it away in another part of the website because they didnt want people to use it.  people used it which is too much for LRG to handle so now they have scrapped it altogether. There is also no real central hub to keep up with all their goingson. You need to keep active on cheapassgamer the official LRG forums Neogaf and Twitter if you want to be  up to date with their latest news. They often air their dirty laundry on these sites too which doesnt make for a good look. Things seem to go wrong so often. They did a preorder for Skullgirls. Now they say they have been too stressed out by it and wont be doing preorders again. Thats fine but again it reeks of amateurism. Another example is the botched Oddworld SW playing cards. Apparently youll have to make another order with LRG if you want to get your pack of cards that you already paid for.Again Im thankful for what they do and I cant fault their customer service in trying to make things right but my god they seriously need to revise and update a lot of things.,vita,ddicbn6,26,t5_2sjmv

One cartridge for play and one to install .GB on your memory card.gtThey could actually be making natively for Vita and then upgrade for PS if they really wanted to please Vita owners or make decent version for both platforms.Over  millions of PS Vita vs over  millions of PS they made their choice on the main plateforme for their games.Again the whole point is how many in the West are willing to pay full price for a Koei Tecmo game on PS vita. Koei Tecmo doesnt have the traction of Nippon Ichi or Idea Factory among the Vita owners in the West. Toukiden  will have the same fate the God Eater   Rage Burst in Europe. gt price drop from  to  within  months.,vita,ddxla13,1,t5_2sjmv
10841120,0,t1_ddwhg69,I bought PD on the big EU sale last month and Im still playing it after having platinumed it! If you enjoy music in general youll like it. If you enjoy Persona music in particular and rhythm games youll love it!Apart from PD Ive been enjoying Shiren the Wanderer. Its a pure roguelike with amazing widescreen pixel art and a very challenging yet deep item management system. Also one of those rare games that work both in small bursts or long play sessions. Counting from  I also enjoyed Super Meat Boy Shovel Knight and Downwell. ,vita,ddy6o26,1,t5_2sjmv
10845833,0,t3_5v22b9,The poorly optimized bit isnt as bad as people say.  The basics of it is that there are some light frame drops in some areas when the flashlight is lit or when you run into a trap on the floor.  And the load times can be somewhat lengthy.

REALLY sucks.The fact SAO Hollow Fragments translation happened speaks volumes for the incompetence and sheer laziness that oozes from them. And none of their localisations have been anything beyond okay in my opinion.They barely make an effort to localise their own games especially on handheld  this should be their bread and butter. It shows me they dont believe in their own products.Their PR is an absolute joke. Remember the youtube comment where they claimed nobody has a Vita? Or the general shitstorm regarding Next Order which only didnt make the company an absolute laughing stock because the mainstream doesnt give a shit about Vita?

I think if your local market is good and willing to price it low and let it go you can sell it quick on CL and that is the way to go.

I hate fighting enemies that do nothing but exchange blows with you. I like it when each enemy type forces you to think about how youd deal with them.Some examples of the gimmicks I speak of are as follows Enemies who explode upon dying thats why its safer to kill them from a distance Enemies who can multiply in number when hit by physical attack so you are encouraged to use magic Enemies who leave behind damaging tiles effectively hampering your freedom to move around safely Enemies who can heal other enemies etc.You get my point.

11379108,0,t1_dfkew4l,Cheers Big Ted!  Saving that info my friend. Do you know if PS TV works with digital Vita games? All my games are digital these days. Any ideas on this score mate? Thanks so much for your feedback. I love that people are so cool and open here. I felt kinda weird asking people about gear like worried they might be like Im not telling you!  when to me it feels more like asking a band what guitar and amp they use to get the sound ect. But gaming feels weird for some reason. Probably because Im not in this scene at all. Not sure of how it all works. Id hope it would be more community than seeing each other as competition or something silly like that. I guess thats the local band stuff Ive experienced from time to time and overthinking things.

The major frame drops have zero effect on gameplay. Zero.  Will some overly picky people get pissy when the game stutters for a blink of an eye? All signs point to yes. But this bullshit narrative about the Switch needs to stop.  The Switchs existence helps extend the life of the Vita.

I usually read several negative reviews as part of my process before buying a game and if their complaints dont fill me with disgust the games probably worth my money.Since the flash sale reminded me that a Vita version exists I can wholeheartedly recommend that you look into Crypt of the Necrodancer. The beats are simple pretty much just quarter notes but the dungeon setup and enemy behavior forces you to internalize all of whats on screen and work out moves in real time. Its very entrancing once you learn the enemy patterns. Doesnt hurt that the soundtrack kicks ass either! ,vita,dg9wn55,1,t5_2sjmv

11652847,0,t1_dgg8lq7,The power of the Vita is one of the things that hurt it imo.Dont get me wrong I love my Vita.  I loved having some of my favorite games of all time on a poratble like Ninja Gaiden Sigma and MGS.But the fact that it was powerful meant people expected AAA home console quality games on a portable.  Which meant devs felt pressured to make said games which cost far more than a less powerful handheld game to make.  But people dont want to pay home console prices for a handheld game! So the system became an indie machine after Sony abandoned it which is fine for some people but not the mass market.  And it still thrives in Japan due to the many JRPG and other Japanese type games... but those also only appeal to a niche market in the rest of the world.This is why the Switch might actually succeed where the Vita failed.  Its a fairly powerful portable but its also being sold as a home console meaning people dont mind paying a full  for a AAA console title.,vita,dggv4yq,1,t5_2sjmv

If you find a Gamestop thats a good local store with an JRPG fan community you get lucky because they only stock what is preordered for VITA. protip As a former GS employee  I can tell you this much about VITA games. If its coming out and you want it or even THINK you want it...preorder it. I know people hate on preorders but just specifically speaking about VITA games the company will ONLY ship them to stores that have a customer request for one other wise you land up with the only  copies situation. When I worked at my store I would literally be the only person getting a physical copy because I was the only person who preordered. Wed get zero extras. Total BS policy but...yea. Money hungry companies dont like putting product on the shelves when smaller publishers dont feel like paying insane amounts of money for representation. remember you can always cancel the preorder no harmno foul if you land up not wanting it endprotip,vita,dgqxbje,1,t5_2sjmv
