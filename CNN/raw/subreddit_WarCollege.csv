You should also use Ibid PAGE NUMBER when citing the same source multiple times in a row. There are several points where you use overly rigid language for example saying combat troops felt X is a universal statement and probably not the one you mean to make.

5858229,0,t1_cxniayl,gt Contrast this with the British models social class differences. The officer corps came from the upper crust of society as a rule while the NCOs emerged from the enlisted who were recruited out of the bottom of society. There was an understanding that officers were upper class NCOs were lower class and there was never a chance that one could have ended up as the other.From what Ive heard youre absolutely right. That said I dont think that dynamic is completely nonexistent in the US military even though NCOs can become commissioned officers they have a lot of pride in not being commissioned officers Im not a sir I work for a living!. In practice I dont think theres too much insecurity between American officers and NCOs about who is in charge.

5892155,0,t1_cxryt7p,Re your concerns The problem is that as far as Japan was concerned any war with the United States would already have been a bad decision.  In effect it didnt matter what doctrine Japan used against the US there would literally have been no chance for Japan to win.  There was no war scenario with the US that had good chances of succeeding period.  The only hope for Japan to win was if a America did everything that Japan planned on them doing and nothing different b everything Japan did went well and c the war did not last long.  Since that is the only conceivable scenario where Japan might be able to reach a positive outcome why not plan your entire doctrine around it?  Sure Japans Mahanian doctrine was outdated and for lack of a better word naive.  But what else could Japan have done?  Fought a war of attrition?  Against a country with prewar industrial strength  to  times stronger than they? The Japanese had already expended operational surprise.  They were also running low on ammunition especially torpedoes.  They had no idea how many American carriers were in the area if any.  Their air crews were tired and the planes needed maintenance.  Time spent chasing the carriers deep in enemy territory was time that something unfortunate could happen like submarines finding the Japanese carriers.  Lastly the Japanese simply did not see the carriers alone as being a substantial threat.  At the time the Japanese naval command was primarily a battleship specialist force Yamamoto and Nagumo included.  They believed that for any action to happen a battleship force needed to be involved.  Carriers alone were felt to not be a substantial enough threat to threaten the Japanese defense perimeter.  Why waste time fuel and ammunition chasing a secondary objective that may or may not be in the area all the while risking running into American submarines when you can withdraw having achieved your primary objectives for minimal losses?,WarCollege,cxrzuvc,38,t5_39t8u
5955526,0,t1_cxzbblw,Yeah the major battles of the Southern theater were all conventional. Im not convinced that guerrilla warfare played a very major role in defeating the British army directly. The militia in the South whether Loyalist or Whig participated in every battle between regular forces and some of the most notable battles of the south e.g. Kings Mountain was fought between Southern Whig militia against Loyalist militiabut it was a conventional battle and not a guerrilla action. The various raiding parties and guerrilla actions that took place were useful in the grander strategic scheme of things though.. They intimidated any neutral residents into either nonsupport of the British or into supporting the rebels. They prevented Loyalists from actively supporting British troops.For example one notable attack by the Whig militia was against a public loyalty ceremony being organized by the British. People were supposed to come and publicly declare the loyalty to the Crown forces and the gathering was also going to be used for recruitment. The Whig forces in the area attacked the gathering killing and wounding a few of those who were there and preventing the event from taking place. This pretty conclusively demonstrated to locals that the British had no power or authority in the area and helped to dry up support for them. . They denied the British the use of the land. This was especially important when it came to supplying the army in the field. During one long march after Greenes army a British soldier recorded that a days meal was an ear of unripened corn split between two menquite a different picture of the British Army than were used to.. Alternatively the active nature of the Whig militia also meant that the Continental Army had an easier time moving through the backcountry. Also in being supplied with food but also guides.This isnt to say that there wasnt intense fighting going on in the South by partisan groups. Its just that most of their effort was directed against each other. Whig militias attacked Loyalist homes or suspected Loyalists and Loyalist militias did the same to Whig militias. EditOne other thing I forgot to mention. The militia were also very effective at maintaining political control for the Whigs. In most of New England this didnt matter so much because the vast majority of the population was antiBritish. In other states it was important. In NJ proWhig militias fought with proBritish ones. In New York at some points the militia was deemed as so unreliable politically that Washington brought in neighboring militia to enforce control. In the South this happened too. The militia would act as the enforcement arm of the various Committees of SafetyCorrespondence which were in effect governing town councils and intimidate and harass locals who had uncertain loyalties. This freed up regular soldiers for actual battle instead of having to tie down men in police action. The Day it Rained Militia Hucks Defeat and the Revolution in the South Carolina Backcountry MayJuly  is a really good look at the way the militia operated in the South.With Zeal and With Bayonets Only The British Army on Campaign in North America  by Matthew Spring is probably the best tactical overview of the way the British operated during the war.American Insurgents American Patriots The Revolution of the People by T.H. Breen is a fantastic look at how Americans went from loyal citizens to insurgents.

6215167,0,t3_40pb0g,Cornelius Ryan reports in The Last Battle that manpower shortages in the Soviet Army were such that they had to use liberated Soviet POWs immediately as reararea security units. As a result discipline was poor in these reararea units which accounted for a large percentage of the looting and other crimes against the German civilian population. By contrast they kept the best manpower with the frontline units who at this point were practically professional soldiers. This was largely confirmed by Lukacs in his AMA in Ask Historians. He was in Budapest when the Soviets liberated the city and noted the same phenomenon as Ryan  excellent and well disciplined troops in the front but an undisciplined looting mob following behind them.The real crisis period for manpower seems to be  or  as this was when crew training was proving to be the biggest bottleneck in deploying new tank units.

The first versions didnt have them and only had the mm gun.There are in fact very significant differences in the different marks of the same tank chassis to the point that an MA should really be considered a completely different beast from the original M. That said the original M already incorporated blowout design for the ammunition compartment. This meant that a hit to the ammo compartment wasnt an immediate death sentence for the crew  as most of the force would be directed outside of the tank. This was a big reason why Abrams were so difficult to completely destroy generally you want to burn or blow up a tank to render it irrecoverable and the easiest way to do this is to blow up the ammo compartment. The Abrams were stubbornly resistant to this in contrast to Soviet designs which tended to have issues with catastrophic ammo compartment hits. This is one of the reasons why they invested a lot on ERA.,WarCollege,cz00al9,4,t5_39t8u

Its a capability and a devastating one against lightly armored vehicles potentially capable of hurting heavier vehicles at the right angle with the right ammo but it was never their perceived role to go hunting for armor.

6930835,0,t3_4anbhb,Im not sure about teaching specific historical facts but I think in terms of representing conflict video games hold interesting storytelling potential because theyre participative in a way that film isnt. I was particular impressed by some of the nihilistic moments in older Call of Duty games where the player inevitably dies no matter what they do to prevent it and also the split screen modes which alternate between one player using the AC gunship from above versus their teammate experiencing the canon shots landing on the ground. I think this is probably one of the best and also most public explanations of this split perspective that Ive seen at least the abstract air view versus the ground.... and think about how many people saw it! Getting more abstract the Metal Gear Solid games while significantly more stylized had some comments on PTSDstorytelling warthe military industrial complex etc. which are interesting and important discussions even if they occur in a sort of cartoon world. Last year a game This War of Mine won awards and praise for its bleak depiction of civilians in war zones and Im optimistic that in the future well continue to see more games try to talk about war and conflict in a serious way. I think as an art medium video games hold tremendous potential. While were on this culture tangent I think comics and longform storytelling mediums also have great potential as well... something like Maus the famous Holocaust comic or Onwards to Our Honourable Deaths WWII Japanese perspective or Farm  Israeli kibbutz life... or Generation Kill the tv show based on the book which the Marines actually endorsed as an accurate depiction of war. Representing war and conflict is always tricky but there is sensitive nuanced and informative cultural work out there. ,WarCollege,d11xoo0,11,t5_39t8u

7464356,0,t1_d2qms8e,The Soviet Divisions in early  were actually supposed to mirror the German ones in every way and even had more artillery and attached tanks  other toys on paper. The problem in practice is that they were in the middle of reorganization when the Germans invaded and most Divisions were just empty skeletons still waiting for their tank  artillery allotment. Even those that did have their attached tanks  artillery often had no fuel or ammo for them.With the invasion wrecking so many units and many experts  particularly artillerymen and tank crews  getting killed wounded or captured it became vital to preserve them. This is why they got consolidated into Corps and Army HQs  as these tended to be betterprotected and live longer  but it also meant that the infantry divisions were often left as masses of K strong riflemen with no real support. It was the choice of sacrificing lots of riflemen with minimal military skills to save artillery and tank expertise that would be needed for a modern war.In short the Soviets actually wanted to fight the German  Western way. The shock of the invasion is what caused the obviously flawed command structure as the Soviets still hadnt completed their reorganization. The few units that had completed the transition  many of which ended up in Ukraine  in fact fought very well and was a big reason why the Germans southern advance was stalled for so long in the early phases of Operation Barbarossa.,WarCollege,d2qng6p,7,t5_39t8u
7720029,0,t3_4kyl91,As for Japan and Japanese weapons I dont think that naginata and yari are particularly easy to be trained well in like most weapons of that time. However it seems to me that yari are easier to be wielded than naginata it requires in general less forearm strength to thrust a spear than to swing a large polearm. However the longet varieties of yari Which can reach up to  feet also require stamina and strength to yield effectively. The training and skill of soldiers on battlefields in Japan would of course vary greatly... but it should be noted that the most and least skilled infantry probably would be using spears. I think the spear became so widely used not because it was particularly easy to be trained in... it seems only slightly easier and more natural than use of other weapons on the battlefield. What really was a major factor was that it was easy to produce en masse which is reflected by the many utilitarian yari blades from that time. It can and was used in group formation which isnt possible with other weapons such as the naginata which requires lots of space for long strokes. It also can deter cavalry charges easily and has armor piercing ability. To that detail most yari were designed with penetration in mind shown by their thick triangularshaped blades For the most part.,WarCollege,d3jpqao,7,t5_39t8u

8310284,0,t1_d5gapp5,Sure but the assets you are talking about are much much much more limited in scope than you are implying. The responsiveness of cruise missiles for example are not such that you could use them to meet broad conventional attacks. I just finished  months as a Task Force Fire Support Officer and btw there is no way in hell a strategic asset like a cruise missile would ever be have control pushed down to a company level. It probably would never drop anywhere below theater or corp level. The attack guidance and target nomination standards for a CHEAP PGM standoff weapon like an Excalibur mm round is incredibly high much less a cruise missile. Their expense and difficulty to employ make them valuable assets to husband for the right time and place.For instance during a JRTC rotation the standard attack guidance for an Excal round again one of the cheapest PGM weapons in the arsenal was nothing less than enemy command posts missile artillery or ADA assets IE high level battle shaping assets. The assets you are talking about are hoarded and saved for moments where they can surgically strike to turn the tide of battles not throw them into the maw of conventional warfare.I also cannot emphasize enough the level of responsiveness of these sorts of weapons. They are great for destroying static positions structures or emplaced weapons like ADA assets. Not so much against conventional on the move offensive forces.One of the reasons attack helicopters are so effective is their responsiveness. Of course if the enemy has ADA in the area the helicopters as a limited and valuable asset lose some of their effectiveness and we are back to square one with your standard conventional offensive which starts with the the recon fight continues with the stand off indirect engagements and ends in the typical force on force knife fight. Most PGMs  still need to have organic assets like Brad FSTVs or on the ground observers to lase and mensurate a target if you are engaging on the move conventional forces.  These stand off weapons are not easy to employ and boots on the ground kinetic units that engage the enemy directly still play the largest part of warfare. I know I was disappointed too as a fire support officer when I started realizing all of our whiz bang technology is far more limited in its scope and use than I thought. For the time being armor infantry mech conventional artillery and close air support are still the big dog in the fight in terms of dominating a battle space. To that end positioning and mutual support are still critical. This of course puts aside the fact that even if all I just said wasnt true contiguous lines and physical positioning is still critical for the flow of information reserves and supplies. ,WarCollege,d5gcc6j,25,t5_39t8u

9222211,0,t1_d8khl9e,Well sure trench warfare appears atypical for African Wars. But there was trenchwarfare in other conflicts on that continent too  or at least trench battles. Perhaps not for duration of some of trench battles between Eritreans and Ethiopians but and for example Kagera War especially early period before Tanzanian invasion of Uganda in  II Angolan War especially battles in Cuito Cuanavale area in  period Rwandan Civil War characterised by bitter and costly trench battles all though  II Congo War even the Battle of NDjili included nearly a week of trench warfare and that was just the start of that war etc. What is actually atypical for African Wars  and thus made both the EthiopianEritrean War of the s and then of the late s and early s atypical too  is conventional warfare. Majority of African wars are caused by insurgencies classic conventional wars between multiple nations  with frontlines heavy weaponry deployed by both sides etc. remain relatively rare. Even bigger rarities are wars where insurgents accept open battles and then start maintaining frontlines. That was something that made both of EthiopianEritrean Wars an aberration though and as mentioned above there were  other exceptions.Anyway... back in the s the factor that contributed to this was the sheer size and power of the Eritrean insurgency which in turn resulted not only in desire but also in ability of insurgents to maintain control over specific areas especially in northern Eritrea. In attempt to reconquer the areas in question Ethiopian military reacted by deploying relatively big formations multiple divisions controlled by corpses etc.. Exploiting terrain but also excellent intelligence and a combination of... well... hopeless incompetence of certain top Ethiopian officers but also plenty of outright sabotage and treason it seems that many of Ethiopian officers were not the least in agreement with politics of their superiors Eritreans came into a position to start accepting frontal battles i.e. create frontlines and defend these. By the times of their second conflict in  Eritreans already had a big standing army and Ethiopians too or at least both sides were in the process of buildingup two big conventional armies so the two militaries clashed in the only way they knew. That said I do not see that war that much characterised by trench warfare and all the accompanying effects usually associated with such warfare most of that is Eritrean PRhogwash. Eritreans occuppied a part of Ethiopia and entrenched themselves there plus along the mutual border. I would call that perfectly normal conventional military tactics for given circumstances. However Ethiopians hit them hard and then outmanoeuvred Eritreans in mobile warfare and that was eventually decisive for the outcome of that war. Overall I do not see that war being that much different to quite a few other conventional African conflicts.Back to Chadians theres not really a large component of Chads forces from Darfur but the Barghawas also known as Baggara in Sudan  the tribe from which President Deby and thus most of the clique ruling that country originates  is originally from Sudan and most of them moved into Chad only since the s. They in turn say this is not the case and that theyre around already since the th Century etc. In Sudan they are closely cooperating with the regime in Khartoum already since ages and have formed the precursors of notorious Janjaweed militias. Indeed there are countless rumours that Deby launched his razzou on NDjamena and established himself in power with help from Khartoum and Qaddaffi too he was supportive for the Sudanese regime so much back in   when Q was affraid of a possible USinvasion or at least an attack on Libya a sizeable chunk of the Libyan Arab Air Force was deployed inside the country. But precisely because of the rift between Deby and a large part of Barghawa ever since nope I do not see them becoming problematic for Bashirs regime. ,WarCollege,d8kzeen,2,t5_39t8u

What does the L stand for?Now the next thing Why do short barreled guns for example the cmKwK  L usually shoot HE? I mean yes they do it because less penetration. But WHY exactly does a short barreled gun have less penetration than a long barreled gun like the cmKwK  L? And why is the HE of a short barreled gun often more effective than the HE of the longer barreled version with the same caliber?Next thing Why are artillery guns or guns that are made to shoot high explosive ammunition generally short barreled? Why choose the schwere Feldhaubitze  mm sFH  L for the Hummel instead of a longer barreled gun?Next thing Why are longer barreled guns usually more accurate?Last thing Whats the reason to choose exactly this caliber? Why .xmm instead of .xmm? Or why not use a bigger caliber like .xmm? Why are there so many different calibers for example the Russians use .xmm for their AKM but .mm for their AK? Also why do Rifles generally have a bigger caliber than for example MPs?

11160853,0,t3_5yrf6z,Two words that drive all weight considerations in military light wheeled vehicles Force Protection. It all comes down to armor and protection from IEDs and small arms. WWI WWII and the Cold War and Korea for that matter were traditional conventional conflicts fought or prepared to be fought along mostly traditional lines  there was a front or forward edge of battle area or any other term you want to call it supported by combat and field trains of logistics supply and medical. While deep attack strategies threatened to disrupt such arrangements the planning equipping and operational art all worked on the basis of a front and a rear.  Vietnam Iraq post invasion and Afghanistan are counterinsurgencies with no rear area. Further the professional military of the current era operates with exceedingly fewer troops than it did in the past. While Vietnam had its share of ambushes and attacks of convoys and light vehicles the sheer number of troops US and ARVN in some areas kept that to a minimum.  Today the significantly smaller force structure and the smaller operational footprint means that the modern ArmyUSMC operates outside of its zone of control frequently along routes and in areas were it only exerts control when it is present which is often infrequent and even then it is a tenuous control and often contested. Asymmetric attacks like IEDs mines ambushes snipers etc. play a more prominent role and ambushes can come from anywhere outside the wire. That also means that convoys troops and material moving between zones of control must due so in the presence of constant threats  hence  FORCE PROTECTION becomes more important than in the past. Fewer troops  more insurgencies  more armor on light vehicles.,WarCollege,dex2k33,1,t5_39t8u

11461158,0,t1_dftm039,Yes and yes.  Plunging fire from defilade was a technique of fire developed in the RussoJapanese War to help deal with various fortifications and it carred over into World War I.  The conditions for the use of plunging machine gun fire were common a long enough distance between the machine gun emplacement and the target so that rounds would arch into the beaten zone a fortified position for the machine gun that would allow for defilade fire and enemy entrenched in a postion that required an arched trajectory for the bullets to be effective.  Plunging fire would be used of course to support the attack.  In the defense grazing fire would be more effective.  This technique of fire was still taught and probably used in World War II though Id have to look for specific examples.  And its still in the US Army Field Manual but I dont know that it gets much use because of changing circumstances in war.,WarCollege,dfv45e3,7,t5_39t8u
