198774,0,t1_cf12cpx,Thanks. I never saw myself as mod material. Mainly due to swearing and being a joker but when this place grows i shall take you up on that offer.The S Zoom will be my main phone. If you compare the S Zoom to the likes of the HTC One or Xperia Z Ultra etc..... Then yes it is no match on specs. But its all about what you use the phone for. The same goes for a PC. If you just surf the web then maybe a  Chromebook is the option for you. But if you mess about with rendering D graphics or use it as a recording studio maybe play graphically heavy games you might want to spend  on a custom built machine. At present the specs of smartphones are getting higher and higher but very little is utilising all that power. One or two games are very graphically intensive but sadly they lack playability. Its all graphics and nowt else. Yeah i know thats just my opinion and what games you enjoy is subjective. But i am happier playing an old C or Amiga game on my phone. The problem is most places on the net that review phones compare every new phone against the highest spec monster thats just come out. But not all phones are built for that customer base in mind. Clearly people who buy the S Zoom want it more for the camera and its rather unique features. As i do. ,galaxys4zoom,cf12zjc,1,t5_2zzcb
