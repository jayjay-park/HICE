1122877,0,t3_25anfa,General Advice Its definitely all about analyzing games after theyre finished and pinpointing where you went wrong and how you couldve played differently in crucial moments. A major thing that new players dont realize is that where you put your focus at any moment is crucial...help out team mates know when an opponent you just contacted is fighting a front battle etc...Specific advice for Rise of Rome Partha UK and Spain are the power positions. In a team game never let your opponents take  of the . Its usually a good idea to have one or two territories in one of these places and then a backup position elsewhere the middle left is usually pretty abandoned I tend to put my secondary starting position there. Also good because it gives you quick access to both UK and Spain.Hope that helps.,Warlight,chvxjzz,2,t5_2rpph

3013886,0,t3_2up6g0,So Im making my first map and when I upload it it gets all glitchy. I checked online on how to make borders and it showed them using the division whereas when I drew it I drew the borders of every province without using division in inkscape. Does this mean I did it wrong and have to redo the whole thing using the division method or is there a way I can salvage my map?BTW. From what I can figure the problem is that in Inkscape the borders for all the objects overlap creating problems with the borders.,Warlight,coadyqp,1,t5_2rpph

7139857,0,t3_4dc8t5,Learn how many armies it takes to take a certain territory. With normal luck it usually takes  armies to take a territory with  armies.Also you need to be somewhat good at strategy. If you have no strategy or and objective you probably wont do well.Where you start is also very important. Some territories are easier to take than others and some territories give more than others. On some maps there are some highly contested places which means even though they are good territories you should probably start somewhere else so you dont get fucked by the other people that start there.,Warlight,d1pq3l5,3,t5_2rpph
