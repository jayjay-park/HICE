1200542,0,t3_27uk7m,Good shopping in Guildford its the major town for a sizeable area around. Apparently a good night out although Ive not been personally. Good transport links with trains into London direct in around  minutes and not too far from the m. Its a relatively low crime area. Thats the more general stuff if you have any more specific questions just ask!,surrey,ci4ogpy,1,t5_2rpei
2653495,0,t3_2nojqi,i.e. we want you to manipulate Google by spamming blogs creating false websites that simply link to the sites you want to elevate.Ugh. Its such a dirty business.The number of shits that post false links as comments to my blog  the number of random domain names the work it causes me in trying to filter them out.Just makes me want to get the name and address of every SEO company owner and punch their fucking lights out. Goddamn pricks.You want your website to get to the top of Google listings? Do a good job. People will naturally find your site over time  may take a year. Artificially fucking with Google search results is a nono. Fucking with my blog is a death sentence.,surrey,cn4xx2j,-2,t5_2rpei

Clocktower with highstreet offices as well as a black cab rank opposite the station. Ive found them all to be moreorless the same tbh some bad experiences but mostly average.,surrey,cub4pin,1,t5_2rpei

9846669,0,t3_5gbn3s,Hey Im just your guy. I have lived in Guildford area for  years and Im currently at U of Surrey. Firstly its safe low crime good police and nice people in general. Bike theft is quite bad other than that its fine. There is a decent amount to do. Loads of sport nice resturants and coffe shops. Huge amount of shopping and many social events however the nightlife isnt great but it is everywhere. It is pretty costly but not massively more than Reading or anywhere else in England. The uni is great. Nice campus nice teachers amazing library good location right next to the station  mins from town centre. Trains are pricey but a student rail card is available online. Any other questions feel free to ask ,surrey,dar1l5i,12,t5_2rpei
