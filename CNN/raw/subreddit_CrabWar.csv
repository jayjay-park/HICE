8770203,0,t3_5078g1,it took me a while to buy so I played for a while without it. I find it immensely useful when idling except for when you are right up against a wall.This was before I could get my shadow swarm mutations to a decent level. So it was my main source of idling.Maxed out with a  second spawn its the equivalent of tapping  times a second.,CrabWar,d71xux4,1,t5_3etlk
8850245,0,t3_51fuw4,Gunner crab seems interesting if you want to tap through the beginning of a run very quickly.For JTP in theory if you got level  then youd come back at  of the distance. I wonder how much that would cost though.,CrabWar,d7bo9qg,1,t5_3etlk

8897576,0,t3_524gkr,I understand the idea. Im neither for it nor against it. I understand that its unfair but in average it should still remain a fair system. For those luckyunlucky dudes however...    But not taking into account gems will change things a lot also. That may make it difficult for some to get past walls they usually go through easily. Some may also concentrate on some mutations for their usual runs when they would need other stuffs for no gem tournaments. It woul make it more difficult for them also so it wouldnt be fair either. So I dont know.    Concerning the spending of pearls during tournaments thats one of the main ways Appwplore is getting money with ads so they wouldnt take them out of tounaments,CrabWar,d7hd0n7,1,t5_3etlk
8903650,0,t3_5287f5,The tip is to evolve wing blade and the queens that come after it and NOT TO evolve the queens that come before. Except for that nothing special just get and evolve mutations if thats still not enough  ,CrabWar,d7i39bo,1,t5_3etlk

9041818,0,t3_5441a3,Yea... I do hope they state some of the details there... Anyway i think someone here will test it out sooner or later,CrabWar,d7yokg2,1,t5_3etlk
9065630,0,t1_d818ypj,It counts if you do it at .  Its a bugfeature of the Juggernaut Crab  after using it your current distance gets reported to the server.  I was in a tournament with a way tie at  I used a JC at  jumping up to  and never beat the  boss mostly for fear of breaking the tie and I was granted the stplace rewards.,CrabWar,d81jj30,1,t5_3etlk
9079723,0,t1_d836xe9,Thanks for data! How can you achieve  for garnet evo bonus? Which path did you choose?Anyway with your data although they are really bigger than mine they give me less than  error.Also im pretty sure now that gem crystalization is bugged. It changes the  in the gem section but it isnt counted in the damage.The TB gem gives you a huge bonus  on ancestral sun. Its too much for a single amethyst gem. Its probably a one time bonus that will finish when you ecdysis.Next run if you will not use your DNA before you should have the same Ancestral Sun dps and same garnetemerald crab. Amethyst crab will have Yc.Tell me if this prevision is right please!,CrabWar,d838hb5,1,t5_3etlk
9081990,0,t1_d83i61x,Maybe... not sure how all the numbers would work out and the cost of it would be insane...since I guess people stop at like k leveling wise if they have the Appx but k otherwise,CrabWar,d83iadk,1,t5_3etlk

9449420,0,t3_5a4zze,i am a new player as well so i cant tell you for sure...but it seems all the top  are cheating...in my tournament the top score is  m at ecdysis level  if that helps at all ,CrabWar,d9ds3kg,1,t5_3etlk
9520144,0,t3_5b0nao,This is the first time Ive seen full sets as I have none and I was really hoping it wiped out the gems and just showed number of full sets along with all the gems not in a full set yet. At a glance this is really not easily readable.,CrabWar,d9mk6io,1,t5_3etlk
9707407,0,t3_5e3nl1,Well they say its big. So it should not be just a graphic tweak ,CrabWar,da9n9re,2,t5_3etlk
9728722,0,t1_dac68h1,But I support the idea. I think it makes more sense. I quit the game  months ago I guess. I was enjoying everything before the tournament came. At first it was okay. But when you see the level s reaching more than I do I can only do  max at the time that I left due to low number of gem sets it very much lowered my moral. It just means that Ill have lower rank every tournament and the ones following it. Lower gems. Lower pearls. Lower gene points. If you cant play for an hour less chances of getting gems from Flitter. I know its about patience but it also talks about the time. Nonetheless the idea of power rating according to gems mutations and gene points is a better idea than the Ecdysis level.,CrabWar,daca0h5,3,t5_3etlk

11396344,0,t1_dfnqew9,Yeah I agree. Butterfly mutations seems to be nice when you get length of all abilities to few minutes. But not probably best mutations for the start.
