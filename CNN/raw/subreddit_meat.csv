106705,0,t3_1v9yew,As a now deleted user explained in this thread on the chances of the customer buying meat like this gt gt Very small. It will get past the people who are too bored to do their job properly but once it hits the butcher whos selling to you he has a very vested interest in keeping your food clean and presentable lest he lose customers. Which is why it is he as the middle man who gets so frustrated. He just wants to sell an edible product but ends up doing a lot of the work he has already paid the wholesaler for and hes losing good productweight due to careless work further back in the chain.gt Bottom line is that consumers really dont need to worry about this. Its not unheard of but if it does happen it will be pretty obvious and you should most definitely take steps to make sure whomever is accountable is held as such.Even if you happened to eat the tumor as usfoglia explained youd probably be okay. gtImmunologistMD student here. Yes it is edible no it is not meat unless it is a tumor of muscle and even then odds are they are undifferentiated tumor cells not really approaching real meat. I do not know why you would want to eat one but yes. If it belongs to another person the odds of you getting cancer are  due to major and minor mismatches between immune antigens called HLAs when you hear people talk about transplant matches this is what they are talking about. So basically your immune system would kill the tumor no problem. Even if the tumor is yours odds are the cells would die in the stomach environment...unless you have stomach cancer low stomach acid and that is the tumor you ate. And even then I do not know of any mechanisms by which a tumor can invade through the GI tract but honestly who knows.,meat,ceqkvv8,3,t5_2qiya

Melt some butter in the dutch oven add a diced shallot and let it sweat season the roast on all sides with salt and pepper and sear on all sides. Combine a bay leaf  can of mushroom soup  cup beef broth a packet onion soup mix and  cup red wine. Pour over roast in the dutch oven and cook at  degrees until fork tender. ,meat,cfgffjq,2,t5_2qiya

3544888,0,t3_30qril,Here what I do and you can do the same with your roast beef just be creative. To make Italian beef sandwiches I take the chuck roast and put it in the crock pot with beef stock about half the way up. Use the real stuff not the low sodium. Next add in packets of Dry Italian dressing mix. Usually about  packet per . lbs of beef. Put on high and let it go for about  to  hours depending on the size of the roast. The beef should start to pull. This is when you should try and get the big fat chunks out. The last hour or so add in some peepers onions pepperoncini and some crushed red pepper flakes. Serve on an Italian hogie with some provolone cheese. You may need to add salt and pepper to taste. So easy and so good!,meat,cpwc8zv,1,t5_2qiya

3628462,0,t1_cq5um3y,I never claimed it was free I said it didnt cost lb. No such thing as a free lunch but I think shooting squirrels with a pellet gun for hrs is about as cheap as food gets save finding mushrooms or wild edibles near home. Your time is only worth what someone else is willing to pay for it  this assumption that spending time hunting couldshould have been used to work a minimum wage job and is therefore costing you the same is ridiculous. If he was living off unemployment benefits and hunting squirrels to supplement grocery costs then maybe its comparable to lb because he could have made more money with that time working said job and shopping frugally.I like fishing its like yoga except I still get kill eat something. Recreation leisure hobbies  these are things worth far more than the time spent. Theyre important parts of enjoying life if the end result is a few squirrels at the cost of pellets and hrs out of his week is it not a cheap meal?

And in order to have happy animal organic meat or whatever we would need many times the space for agriculture that is potentially available on planet earth.You can comfortably sit on your high horse if you really can afford that type of meat every day and feel less like a monster but the reality is that we do not need to cannibalize animals. Plants dont feel pain they dont suffer and have emotions or a central nervous system.And all protein is in the first place produced by the Flora mother the Fauna father is supposed to feed on the Flora not on itself.
