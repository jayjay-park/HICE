4928389,0,t1_cufqmjw,I myself have lived in a few complexes in the area. I also know people that live in a bunch of the complexes I havent lived in.Someone above mentioned Goettens Grove which I have seen multiple apartments inside and they are pretty nice. Nice location too.I little pricey but if its in your range Cypress Court is a great place to live. Being just over a year old all of the appliances are up to date. Granite countertops and the like.Park Place Estates is a decent place not sure the going rates but I have known many people to live there and enjoy it.Grand River Estates is a pretty nice place too. Again right at the top of your budget but worth a look. This one is a little off the beaten path but close to I which is nice.One that I can say stay away from is Sterling Heights in Southeast St. Cloud. Management has gone from wonderful to terrible in the  years I lived there. I no longer live there but I cant imagine a change for the better so soon.,saintcloud,cufrgtu,6,t5_2slv3
