11211228,0,t3_5zwl6h,This is the episode where the plot progresses and to top it of I might be little heavy as we all know that Shiny Chariot left the from the view of the world  years ago but no one knows why? I believe it has to do with that mysterious witch we been seeing in the opening and no I dont believe it has do with the backlash from bunch of critics. This is might going to happen Akko will ask what happen to shiny chariot that is the one question that has been probably on her mind and if she does we will learn a little bit of the truth.,LittleWitchAcademia,df2s36x,3,t5_2x9si
