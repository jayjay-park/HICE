886744,0,t3_23xn2d,Changed ending to be more actionable.  Like it though.Downvotes and Threshold  An issue that has popped up recently is the somewhat unjust downvoting of certain deals. We see it most often with games universally hated by the community like WarZ or Day One Garys Incident but we have more recently seen it with the Humble Weekly sale from PewDiePie. When a submission is voted into the negatives it drops below the default vote threshold for many users. You can change the threshold in your preferences but unfortunately the vast majority of people will always have the default. When this happens many people are unable to see the deal and it gets reposted many times. This has led to people calling for us to disable downvotes. Unfortunately downvotes cannot be disable entirely only hidden via CSS. Weve watched closely as other subreddits have experimented with this but the conclusion always seems to be that its not effective. Downvotes can still be applied from mobile devices the front page the recently viewed list or people who have CSS disabled.We would really stress folks to please not downvote legitimate deals because its not just showing your frustration but also hiding the deal from others.  Wed also encourage everybody to lower their threshold settings so that all posts are visible.  Outside of these recommendations we dont see any clear fixes for this problem.  What suggestions or strategies would you recommend to make sure legitimate deals are still seen?,RCA,ch52qvx,1,t5_2sfgi
