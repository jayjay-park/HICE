8347877,0,t1_d5l0u6x,gt Either way remote editing isnt that useful to me since I much prefer to edit on the machine that Im going to buildrundebug on. Me too. The biggest smile came on my face when I tried to push my changes to bitbucket from the bash terminal running in Code. Im using bit bucket to sync my local machine with the my core GB desktop.gt  If I can do that locally with a really fancy editor like VS Code thats rad as hell. If not... Im happy where I am.As for debugging Im sure I can find a way to break it but without any preparation all the vs debugging tools are working for my python projects.,bashonubuntuonwindows,d5l1d4m,1,t5_3e5pz
