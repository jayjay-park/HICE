2987741,0,t3_2ud0i0,Im not sure this is an actual Jackson Pollock piece. The earlier more colourful action paintings particularly are very very dense and textural this piece looks much more open and although people might disagree when it comes to this sort of painting to my eye it looks less accomplished. Id guess that this is a piece done in imitation of Pollock to evoke the idea of his work more than anything. There are a number of practical and aesthetic reasons this could have been done it could be that for a piece that size getting someone to do a work in Pollocks style might have ended up cheaper than making a print it could also be that a more authentic piece would have been wrong to film against.,WhatIsThisPainting,co7od1b,1,t5_327iw

I used to keep notebooks in high school with lists of all the metal bands I had even heard of and I dont know how many issues of Metal Edge I bought but all of that was decades ago and my memory is weaker than my will power.

9711282,0,t3_5ce6gs,This is a Madonna with child and John the Baptist as casualetheia has said. Its oil on a wooden panel. The panel is curved evenly and has a kind of groove which Id say indicates it was likely removed from some context not having been made to be displayed in a frame. I cant quite tell you where from. Where did you get s as your date? Its probably much much more recent. The faces have that kind of air about them. The painter is probably just a locally known painter.

I cant tell if its bleaching from being in too much light or if its possibly white mold growing over the paint. Either way you should look to getting that resolved and when they take the painting out from the frame a very nice and expensive gilted frame btw they are likely to find the signature. good luck!,WhatIsThisPainting,dauvqzx,0,t5_327iw
