It has more then enough power for programming has a beautiful screen and its touchscreen. Only downside is battery life and bloatware when you purchase it.Now this recommendation is alright but if you are good with computers and know how to install linux I would highly advise you to get yourself a chromebook. Although Chrome OS is not the best for programming linux will work great.

6063189,0,t3_3yk0c3,Well Ive had my MSI GS Ghost Pro for about  weeks now and basically I love it. Runs a solid  FPS for most games on the highest settings Skyrim and CSGO for example and I managed to pull off  FPS on Portal when playing for the first time today.There are a few things I will say about it though My biggest concern was the battery life which seems to be  hours maximum when doing simple word processing and stuff. Havent tested gaming on the battery yet but have heard reports it is about  hour. My second largest problem is the low amount of USB ports. I would have liked more although I really havent run into a problem with that. More would have been nice though. Another is that because it is so thin and light the fans run relatively loud when gaming or using other more taxing programs. Personally I always wear headphones while gaming so that doesnt bother me and I would willingly deal with this for the weight and size. The final thing is that I has difficult adjusting to the track pad. It was probably just difficult to transition from one with dedicated right and left mouse click buttons to one with none and it is larger than the one I had on my old laptop but I very often was unable to click properly. But this was easily solved with a simple external USB mouse though which I was planning to use anyways.Brandwise I dont know enough about Sager to say which is truly better but MSI seems like a strong company. It might not be very well known but everyone I talked to seemed to think they were reliable. Unfortunately I have heard their customer service may be a little difficult to contact sometimes.The display on my GS Ghost Pro is gorgeous. It is incredibly bright I actually turned down the brightness and isnt hard to see in direct sunlight or anything. Colors seem to show up great I again dont know anything about Sager so I cant really comment on that.Overall a really nice laptop which I would definitely recommend. Id still hope to see some input from someone who knows more about Sager but I personally love my MSI GS Ghost Pro Quick edit Just thought Id mention that one of my favorite things is how it really doesnt look flashy or anything like some other gaming laptops do. It has the MSI logo on the top but other than that it really has nothing that stands out and screams IM A GAMING LAPTOP if you set the backlit keyboard to white. I personally like leaving it as a nice turquoise though. I think it looks really nice.,laptops,cyedlax,1,t5_2qoip

8381474,0,t3_4ufala,. I like your flair.. Opt for the amazon deal. Can you find a  GB SSD for roughly ? Its probably not worth the hassle to pop open the back even if it is one screw and swap it out myself. Unless you have a crap load of games and other multimedia that require storage in which case get an external drive opt for the SSD option.Wait for back to school deals. If you dont need it now then youll find pretty good deals in a month or so. You can negotiate with Dell say youre a student so just chat up like  sales reps and try to get the best deal possible.Youre good with a iHQ. The difference between an i and i is negligible for a high school student and youre likely not going to require the hyperthreading that the i offers. i is great and itll be powerful enough for your needs. Same with RAM  I cant imagine you needing more than  GB. There are very few AAA titles that require more than  GB and again youll be hard pressed to need more than  GB of RAM for the tasks youll be using it for in high school even college. Dell Tech Support sucks ass. Their customer support sucks ass in general. I might be heavy handed in saying this but Ive had to RMA a brand new XPS  times.

8493385,0,t1_d62xa5a,I am not saying that Nvidia jacks up their prices to an exorbitant amount. But as you can see the lineup has changed compared to what it was on . If what the news says its true that Nvidia has phased out the M moniker on their systems it will compete at the same level as the desktop part. Now if were talking like its  it means that any laptops with M are essentially at the level of the laptops with full desktop . Do you get what I mean here? Check out the release price of  equipped laptops and report back to me if theres anything on the  range. Unless its a second hand or a refurb unit I think its highly likely that youll find one. You personally know this dont you?? Spec to naming wise to make it simple let me Put this in an easytodigest list of what Maxwell part will be replaced by Pascal considering that theyll drop the M scheme.  gt . M gt . M gt . M gt  quite likely that theyll shell out a GP part soon. Its that or its a GP with probably  coresWhy is it different now? Well Founders Edition is whats different. See they sell their cards at  price premium over the past model. Also the rarity of the cards jacks up the price even higher.

So power draw and temperature isnt the best. Ok so whats the issue with desktop pricing going up? Note that those buying these TOTL laptops are very very likely to be an enthusiast themselves. My consideration in my original comment was not even accounting for the  price increase for these chips and being an enthusiast puts you on a niche market. Price sensitivity and elasticity of demand does not apply here as much as those in the  budget range. Simply put lets say I spend  on a new Pascal equipped laptop.

Battery life is amazing   hours with average use.  Keyboard has decent feedback. Soft touch palmrests are comfortable.  Trackpad is smooth gesturesscrolling work well  Two USB . ports. Headphone jack on the side. Cons  Camera is below the screen resulting in poor anglesvisibility. Camera itself is passable but nothing special.  A few intermittent driver issues e.g. screen flickering waking from sleep Thunderbolt issues updates required. No problems on the latest drivers as of .  Keyboard is a bit shallow.  Keyboard layout not terrible but far from ideal. e.g. XPSs Fn key required to use HomeEndPgUpPgDn no Fn numpad.  Trackpad clicking could be crisper discrete buttons would be nice.   is appropriate for movies but  or even  would be better for computer work.  Screen is inset and accumulates hardtoremove dust at the cornersedges  Requires two hands to open  Persistent lights on the power button power cable and front of the laptop can be annoying  Vents from bottom can get very hot on a couchbed.  Thunderbolt port requires an adapter. Overall despite some minor annoyances its an extremely solid laptop with great design and performance. I would highly recommend it.,laptops,d9n4th4,1,t5_2qoip

Nearly any older game will be able to be run very well. the two things I noticed on my integrated graphics in my Dell XPS and Im not sure if this is an issue still on newer Intel chips is that shadows and some ground textures in many games like Black and White  Battlefield  etc showed up as black splotches. They would also often flicker. It was very distracting. The second thing is that UTK was more than capable of running fluidly on it used to run it all the time but on Windows  I get a DirectD driver error that would cause it to crash to desktop.

10679963,0,t3_5ssgb6,Coil whine is completely safe poses no danger etc. Its a very common phenomenon and completely harmless to everything but your sanity.Basically the motherboard has small coils like these all over it. These are usually used to flatten voltage especially in power coming from wall sockets and adaptors  hence more noise when plugged in. Long story short as electricity wizzes around the motherboard it can create electromagnetic forces which act on the coils and if the coils arent firmly secured then this can make them vibrate and rattle.In reality you cant completely stop the coils from vibrating so theres always a little bit of rattling and buzzing. Its completely normal to be able to hear this with your ear pressed up to the keyboard.However if you can hear it from  meters distance especially in a moderately noisy environment then this is abnormal and its definitely worth taking this up with Dell.

11138535,0,t3_5xtvkl,So I discovered plugables latest USB c docks during my search which led to some bigger questions and concerns about how well the display adaptation technology in these docks works and how to deal with the fact that my x monitor only offers DVI VGA and DIsplayPort NO HDMI.see graphics performance specifically... The nd and rd graphics outputs HDMI DVIVGA are powered by DisplayLink USB graphics technology which leverages the host GPU amp CPU to render the image. These outputs are recommended for webproductivity software not recommended for gaming or HD video.My thoughts that are driving the direction of my researchA. This is a USB .type Cdock there are USB  docks and laptop options too. I assume most docks since theyre based on USB must use this DisplayLink USB technology buuutMost manufacturers dont even disclose what technology theyre using for the display adaptation and just say woohoo  k displays whee!. So based on the footnote from plugable warning that DisplayLink is not suitable for gaming or HD video use it  seems like other manufacturers might be glossing over technology limitations that mean you wouldnt be getting the same display performance via the dock as you would via a direct cable.So if what pluggable says about USB c display port alternate mode is true I should select a laptop on their comparability list. Since my monitor doesnt have an HDMI port an HDMI to DVI or DP cable couldbe a simple workaround plug input and power into dock plug adapter cable direct from laptop to monitor but I have my doubts as to whether an adapter cable would function with the dock inbetween if the dock is already using special technology to send HDMI data over USB.Does anyone have experience with the video over USB performance or better yet the technology being used so they can advise on whether a DVI to HDMI adapter cable would even probably work with this plugable docks Display port alternate mode HDMI port?,laptops,deujigu,1,t5_2qoip
11162763,0,t1_dex87fw,gt How do you feel about the Samsung odyssey?I feel that its extremely generic with no differentiation for itself within the gaming laptop market. Its trackpad looks odd because of the glossy black plastic surrounds and the angles of that section make the whole laptop look sort of skewed or oddly proportioned. For  with only a  its also pretty poorly equipped. You can get a better equipped laptop from Dell with the Inspiron  with the Core i and  Ti with a GB SSD for   less and more powerful. For  more than that Odyssey you can get the Acer Aspire I linked you with more than double the GPU power a better pedigree and build quality and more professional looks that you can take anywhere without getting sideways glances.

You can practically make up any reason for why somethings messed up and have the seller work it out. One time I got a projector screen that was wrinkled and dinged during transportation. I basically coerced put the seller into such a corner that they just ended up letting me keep it and gave me a full refund.You basically have a few things to keep in mind Look through ALL of their ratings. Make sure they havent just been selling socks or some stupid shit like that for their feedback rating. Look at ratings specifically for laptops or your chosen item. Do a full inspection of the item when you get it. IMMEDIATELY. Everything. Note ANY issues. If you see any issues they did not note and its a deal breaker for you make them eat the return shipping and give you a full or partial if you can live with it refund.
