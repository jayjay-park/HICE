701508,0,t3_22528o,From what Ive been reading its not a good idea to feed them in their normal tank due to them thinking its feeding time every time you reach your hand in and likely biting you. Get a tub or something and put him in the tub when you feed him so he knows when he is in the tub that its feeding time. Anyone feel free to correct me if Im wrong.,ballpython,cgk0ijh,0,t5_2srho

3064839,0,t3_2v9jfz,exactly where are you measuring your temperatures? a UTH isnt meant to provide ambient heat. its only supposed to provide heat directly through the floor of the enclosure to be absorbed by the belly scales of the snake. this is the kind of heat ball pythons need for digestion.if the enclosure is a glass aquarium with a screen lid thats another problem. you have no ambient heat because the glass is an extremely poor insulator and screen lids allow for a lot of air flow. because of these factors if your room temperature is cold your enclosures ambient temperatures will be cold.,ballpython,cofo1no,3,t5_2srho
3338279,0,t3_2ycn1d,Do not use a glass tank!!! It is a pain in the ass to keep heat and humidity up. Either your humidity is perfect and your heat Id too low or your heat is perfect and your humidity is at  percent. Glass tanks for ball pythons are just headaches to deal with. I am not going to judge you on how you house your snake because either one works its just that the plastic tank is way easier to deal with. Now if you have a desert species of snake like a corn snake it is nice to keep in a glass tank because they are really active and you can see them and they dont require high humidity. ,ballpython,cp8sf4n,1,t5_2srho

3684934,0,t1_cqcalfe,Look nobody is trying to be a dick but you dont understand the current scientific understanding if these creatures. They always choose the same hide because its the most suitable and they both want it. If you separate them then youre putting at least one of them in a new enclosure which could account for at least one of them not eating  theres a possibility they didnt wantneed to eat as often as they do when theyre together either but since you have them in the same cage they think they have to eat when prey items are offered in order to be competitive with the other one. No snake wants to be handled by a larger creature than itself they simply tolerate it and maybe enjoy the warmth. Again nobody is trying to be a dick  but those snakes to not like each other. Snakes dont have a big enough brain to like anything at all. They simply react to stimuli in a way dictated by their instincts. Sense warmth  rat smell  hungry  strike and eat. Warmth of a human  ball up and cuddle. We can project whatever emotions we want on to them but they dont have any.,ballpython,cqcb27d,6,t5_2srho

6226683,0,t3_40ijx7,Id assume since its in a major city like Toronto you should be able to pick everything up.  Id imagine that you could toss together something there but its still not a guaranteed.  Last show I went to I was expecting to buy a snake or two and a rack from a vendor that was listed as attending I didnt recognize any other rack manufacturers on the list.  When I got there it turned out that he was at some other show but if I ordered something from him from pick up another vendor was holding onto it.  So I was buying  more snakes and didnt have a rack or anything to house them in.  I found another vendor that had racks got a normal price on a combo rack it was the online shipped price though  so I got what I needed but it wasnt really what I WANTED.Bedding food water bowls hides UTH decorations will all be there.  Smallest show I was ever at was like  vendors total and they had all of that stuff.  Someone else said rats were cheaper to buy than getting them shipped but I havent experienced that.  The prices are pretty much the same if not more for me but that all depends on your location and how many snakes you have.  In Florida theres a place that ships next day to me for  bucks and has just about the cheapest rodents Ive seen online on top of that a reptile store is like  minutes from my house that sells frozen  for the price of   off on Fridays where I can pick out the exact sizes I want.  It also might be different in Canada though I just always see cheap rodent prices and only  dollars shipping.Theyll give you a small container to hold it in.  Ive kept mine since theyre pretty useful for other stuff I use the biggest one as a bowl on my scale.  I wouldnt worry about temperatures or humidity.  Id make the car comfortably warm for yourself and not worry about it.  The snakes do fine sitting in those tiny containers as long as its for short periods and if you didnt buy the snake its guaranteed that it would have spent MORE time in the container.  It wont have heat but just keep it as comfortable as possible for the snake and itll be fine.  Three out of my four snakes I bought at shows about . hours from me and there were no issues.  As a matter of fact they all ate great pretty fast the th snake I had shipped and it was pounding ft at the breeder and now it only pounds live ,ballpython,cyxems1,1,t5_2srho

I read that its best when maternally incubating to let the female choose the space in the tank where shes going to incubate since she knows what heat amount theyll need and to keep spagnum moss in there thats damp but not wet.

10208542,0,t1_dc14qix,Because as Ive said previously that is all he had ever had before he came to me. Just judging by his old enclosure when I got him you could tell things were fucked up. For instance his tank was about five feet long had just a mesh top and his only source of heart was an adhesive UTH that literally had shirt in the wiring. On top of that the bedding was about three or four inches of wood chips so even if they UTH somehow worked it wasnt anywhere close to being suitable. Furthermore his light source yeah he had a light source for whatever idiotic reason was a five foot strip of fluorescent lighting. To make matters even worse they were only feeding him a monthly basis. Given all this shit he had been through up to now or then rather coupled with the already finicky eating habits of balls I at least wanted to keep his food routine the same for awhile albeit on much more frequent basis. As for why the live rat in the tank with him how else do I give him live prey if not in the same enclosure as he? Im fully aware of the importance on switching to ft prey and that was the point of my original post. That even with all the shit he had been through and even though he had only known killing his own prey he was still willing to eat prey that was already dead. Meaning the transition to ft prey shouldnt be as hard and frustrating as it has been for others. If nothing else it means I can now continuing putting the rats down myself before giving them to him and he wont have any issue eating them. ,ballpython,dc1716g,3,t5_2srho

10821295,0,t3_5uplr4,most of that list is a waste of money. im going to dump a bunch of links for you the first three links are detailed care sheets and the rest are product recommendations.glass tanks can be very challenging for ball python husbandry and this is especially true of largetall tanks. its generally recommended to use tubs or pvc reptile cages instead. tanks can work but they require a lot of modification and maintenance. ill give you product recommendations to cover options for tanks tubs and pvc cages.       here is a tutorial to give you an example of how to set up a tub. this is what i would recommend for an immediate setup and you could upgrade to a pvc cage upgrade later. a  female is going to need something with a fairly large footprint like a qt underbed sterilite tub. note the tutorial shows adhesive velcro to attach the thermohygro to the tub wall but you should not do that. tape and other sticky adhesives should never be used inside the enclosure your snake can get stuck on it and suffer serious injuries.  pvc reptile cages are ideal giving you the husbandry benefits of a tub with the aestheticsvisibility of a tank. animal plastics boamaster and boaphile plastics are some popular companies. many people will use a tub for a young snake and upgrade to pvc later.  spyder robotics makes high quality thermostats to regulate your heat sources with pulseproportional temperature control and various safety features. this is a popular cheap thermostat with simple onoff style with zero safety features. any heat source should be regulated by a thermostat.  heat tape or ultratherm heat pads are high quality and affordable under tank heater UTH options. a porcelain base lamp and ceramic heat emitter CHE is the best ambient heat source for a tank. any heat lamp that emits light even red or blue should not be used at night.  a radiant heat panel RHP is the best ambient heat source in a pvc cage. there are a few options such as reptile basics and pro products  a digital dual sensor thermometerhygrometer allows you to easily monitor the warm side floor temperature with the probe as well as the ambient temperature and humidity with the main unit. an infrared thermometer allows you to spotcheck surface temperatures anywhere in the enclosure. these hide boxes are a cheap simple hide with a design that offers the best sense of security for your snake. cave style hides cardboard boxes plastic food containers etc can also be used. half logs are not appropriate hides.     ,ballpython,ddw527h,7,t5_2srho

10966211,0,t1_de8queo,Ive lived with a few dogs and they have never been interested in the snake. The cat on the other hand liked to try to sleep on top where it was warm.,ballpython,deb35mc,2,t5_2srho
11025468,0,t1_deho80d,Not exactly but when I was trying to measure her before taking the pics I was figuring  feet ish. Her frozen rat weighs about  grams weekly. Im told she hatched the December before last but it was a petsmart so Im thinking shes may be older. ,ballpython,dehphph,1,t5_2srho

11098701,0,t1_deprxar,theyre tiny black bugs and ive seen them under the scales the pictures just dont show it. i showed the pictures to the store i got the snake from and they said it wasnt scale rot but now im getting more concerned about it and im going to take it to a vet this weekend,ballpython,deq10uo,2,t5_2srho
11117034,0,t1_des3me5,yes she is immensely stressed because she doesnt have adequate hides. cardboard boxes with no tape on them are all you need this doesnt have to be a difficult or expensive problem to fix. she is definitely dehydrated as evidenced by the stuck shed. do you know what the humidity is in the enclosure? do you know what the temperatures are? what type of heat sources are you using? is anything regulated by a thermostat?she could be developing a respiratory infection or she could be too hottoo cold or she could just be stressed. we need a lot more details to figure that out and give you solutions. ,ballpython,des3unp,4,t5_2srho
11138296,0,t1_deui2k3,Thanks! I have an under the tank heater and a lamp on top for heat and the tank stays about  degrees. Do you have any suggestions on how to keep the humidity up? I want to treat her well and give her an appropriate enclosure to accommodate all of her needs. ,ballpython,deuijbh,1,t5_2srho

11318934,0,t1_dfez0u7,Well you should have two identical hides for the snake so they dont choose security over heat regulation and if you cover the screen top some people use aluminum foil or plexiglass that will help.  But as someone who has had a glass tank for  months lemme tell ya its gonna be a constant battle to keep the heat and humidity regulated.  I mean constant.  Tons and tons of work. And make sure your humidity gauge has a probe and doesnt use sticky stuff to adhere inside the tank people have had snakes die from getting the adhesive stuck to them.  ,ballpython,dfezdky,2,t5_2srho
11370940,0,t1_dfksjjl,Thankfully I dont have any regrets having bought the  gallon breeder for less than retail value including all the surprise accessories that I can still use with my bp that came inside the thing. Kijiji is my jam.Ill likely house a beardie in there when I have more expendable income.. Meanwhile the  gallon I had my snake in initially will soon house what it is supposed to fish!,ballpython,dfkvhz3,2,t5_2srho
11602173,0,t1_dgb3prd,how much did those rats weigh? feeding her too much and causing her to gain weight too fast is just as problematic as underfeeding her.,ballpython,dgb45yk,2,t5_2srho
