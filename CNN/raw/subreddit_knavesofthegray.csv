7510659,0,t1_d2ujrxu,I would love to join you guys for PvP shenanigans. Like Seven I am not exactly good at it but I do have decent experience. I was with a group the other day and it was a load of fun being a part of a huge force and taking down keeps. I feel like in order to make things work in a group we would need a leader who has experience in leading PvP groups or even just a PvP vet in AD. In terms of getting group members my group I was with would just pick up randoms that wed come across in battles. The group essentially builds itself we only need a leader,knavesofthegray,d2vxagl,1,t5_3c14y

7936657,0,t1_d47ye5s,That would be great man! Also I signed up to BAND. Will look for others there. ,knavesofthegray,d485lpq,1,t5_3c14y
7969669,0,t1_d4bjoa7,Yes I like the second option because the whole point is to collect money not give it away. But after conferring with everyone on the BAND app it seems option one is the go to for us to start the lotto.Getting all the items would take some time to farm if were not farming then we would have to buy certain items. Again that brings up the spending gold issue. I thought crafting sets with farmed mats would be the best but everyone made a good point. Were all too nice here and if someone needs crafted setsmats were pretty quick to help them. So far on Monday I will be starting the lotto at .kticket. Winner will receive a percentage of the pot. That percentage at this time is going to have to be determined based off of the number of people contributing. Remember no matter what we all win in a sense because having a trader makes all of us merchants money.Thanks for the input guys the other options are not completely off the table,knavesofthegray,d4bv75b,2,t5_3c14y

8048801,0,t1_d4krbyt,That is seriously the best thing Ive seen in a long time lol. My husband is always photoshopping stuff like that and if he gave a two craps about my gaming Id get him to make me something. I think it helps build interest if its advertised in a fun way so I think this is very cool. ,knavesofthegray,d4kreb1,1,t5_3c14y
