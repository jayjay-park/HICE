Theres a flag that really looks Canadian but Im not sure because I have a weird angle on it. But maybe somewhere northern? Theres little street flags that say Brandon VT. I have no idea what thats near and it looks pretty small so Im going to explore more. I found  North on the map and then Brandon Swamp so I zoomed in more and found the town. I zoomed in super far and found the stores that I was placed in front of.  points.Round s Im at the corner of K and th in a big city which Im pretty sure is DC based on the NW on the street signs. I found it on the map right away without even leaving my starting intersection  I just got lucky because of my familiarity with DC. I just put myself at the wrong part of the intersection and lost a point.  points.Round s Water! The sign says Ferryville Boat something and theres a train track behind me.

I find a city bus for a company starting with Syd which should be South in Danish the biggest city in southern Denmark is Esbjerg and as I zoom on it I find both roads mentioned above as well as Gjesing which is my bus destination. The starting location is just east of the intersection between Strandby Kirkevej and Torvegade.. s This definitely looks like a British town. On the main road I find several mentions of Lincolnshire and Lincoln and zooming in on the latter I can easily find the starting location on Monson St just east of High St on the side of a church.. s A residential area. The language around really sounds Icelandic. I easily find an intersection between numbered routes  and  a sign also tells me Im north of Hfn which I find on the eastern coast. The two roads meet in Egilsstadir the starting location is to the west of Dynskogar a deadend road I can easily spot.. s Were on a big bridge. The place has a Soviet vibe but uses latin script. A sign points towards Vilnius Panevezys and Klaipeda three of the biggest cities in Lithuania... which are at opposite ends of the country. Kaunas is another big cities in the middle of them and indeed as I zoom on it I find a big bridge with a railway station to the north whose name checks out on the map.. s Another residential area. From the environment and the language Im more leaning towards Norway this time. Again I reach the main road and find signs for Route  as well as a Welcome to Finnsnes sign roads starting with  are found around Tromso Finnsnes being big enough to be easily spotted. The starting location is on Kirkeveien north of the beautiful lakeside park but I dont have enough clues to place a precise guess so I lose a couple points on this one.,geoguessr,czcztu1,2,t5_2x85i

I found the building and placed my marker I was off by .km.s Theres a flag not too far away but I cant tell whether its Australia or New Zealand and the advert for the  cricket World Cup around the corner doesnt help as it was cohosted by both countries. Looking at the top of the building at the start though there is the flag which represents Aboriginal Australians so this is Australia. I soon narrowed it down to Adelaide after a bit more exploration so the building is the Parliament of South Australia. I found it on the map and placed my marker I was off by .km.s Old colonial buildings along with tropical trees suggests Asia and I soon found this to be Singapore. I was able to find the old and new parliaments and placed my marker. I was off by .km.s This is South Africa but which city? The country itself has four capitals for various functions but the building looks more like a regional government building. A tourism bureau tells me that this is Tshwane which is the modern name for Pretoria. A sign says it is the Ou Raadsaal. I managed to find the square on the map and placed my marker. I was off by .km.s Mentions on signs of the HMS Bounty and the Seventh Day Adventist Church along with the tropical look of the place says that this is Pitcairn Island.

A bit further west along the road and I see a sign for Minnesota highway  and the town of Redby which is on the shores of Lower Red Lake. Im still not great at narrowing down to the exact location however and select too close to town.s Striking location scenic canyon along the Rio San Juan.  Either Argentina or Chile due to the landscape.  Not too far off I see a truck with what looks to be an Argentine flag.  Dont see any route markers but there is a large city called San Juan in western Argentina so I guess near there.   kms off.s Beautiful landscape once again.  Norway due to the geography and the few signs that I see.  Disappointed that I never saw a town marker or highway sign to help narrow it down  did I just not see it?  so I guessed southern Norway and was km off.s Mediterranean looking city French signs so probably southern France.  A couple of busses indicate that they are from Marseilles and the city seems large enough for that to be the case.  I eventually see a sign for Aix en Provence and Toulon so Marseilles it is though the lack of street signs makes narrowing it down difficult.  km off.s Scenery today has been fantastic.  Pastoral could be Scotland.  A Scottish flag and gaelic on the signs seems to confirm things.  Little town of Helmsdale on the A.  This was one of those situations where I had enough time to do one of three things keep going into town and see what I could see look on the map for the town look on the map for the highway.

I find the latter but Brus is nowhere to be seen! I even check Slovenia and Croatia thinking were somewhere near the border where they use Cyrillic... but nope. Place my guess along  and hope for the best. Turns out we were actually on ... went back to check later and the sign was wrong.. s Typical South African round a road seemingly in the middle of nowhere yet were just off a marked intersection where I learn Im on R between Carnarvon and Williston. I know where the former is but I still have a long stretch of road to deal with... in the end I identify my starting location as being between two branching roads west of a curve near a bridge over a conveniently marked dried riverbed.. s Typical Brazilian rural landscape. Im at km  of some road so I follow it north hoping to find some decent clues at km ... nope I reach the town of Santa Terezinha where I learn the road was SC... but nothing else. I look for it in the state of Santa Catarina but cant find neither the road nor the town. I place my guess between roads with similar numbers and get surprisingly close. The road wasnt marked on Maps.. s Spanishlike signs tell me were in Vega de Villalobos going south I discover Im on a road marked as ZAP. I think Zaragoza at first but notice ZA stays for something else the second biggest city starting with ZA is Zamora near Portugal so I look around that area to find Villalobos. Plenty of similarly named places but no luck in the end I just placed my guess in the similarly named Villalube hoping for a mistranslation. Dang I didnt check north of the A.. s Easy ending at the junction for Carlos Tejedor in what definitely looks like Argentina. Signs tell me Im along RN north of Pehuajo.

It was indeed near that coast.. s Country road through corn fields bad quality pictures definitely the Midwest. Going east I eventually reach OH and the village of Venedocia where I find signs pointing towards OH and Ohio City. A glance at the map reveals x roads are clustered near the IN border and I find  easily. Starting location on WrenLandeck just east of Ireland.. s Typical South Africa middle of nowhere yet nearby signs give me all the precious info I need. R  km north of Brandvlei easily spotted in Northern Cape. Sadly the road is rather featureless and I can only rely on a multitude of country roads branching off. Find two that look like the ones near the start but Im  kms off.. s Just off a dam in a place called Marina del Rey. Find Mexican flags and after wandering for quite a while I find signs for Sonora state roads to Cd. Obregon. With little time left I pick a random spot on the Sonora coast near Obregon oblivious to the fact that I was near a dam... and picking a lake would have been more appropriate. Luckily I wasnt too far away.. s Lovely South American mountain town. Im thinking Peru and signs with the Peruvian army emblem confirm my impression.

Going east and sees Im on D at exit to Karadona.  s Bangladesh Meghna Gomti Bridge. Meghna seems to be a major river and there are only a few bridges over it. Finds only one going directly eastwest and it is not on the main branch of the river but still is named Meghna so guesses there.  s Bad US quality. Goes east and gets to Barnesville in a state that must be Ohio based on shape. Was expecting us to me more estern so concentrates searching the easternmost part which makes it easy to find. Started by a marked church.  ,geoguessr,d5p50pv,2,t5_2x85i

8626751,0,t3_4xzrat,I got  points.  ampnbsp  s There were unfortunately three misplaced markes otherwise i wouldve had better points.  ampnbsp  As Buick car dealer in Ohio  I saw the OH sign as well as the US sign. We are on E Columbia on the corner to N Foster Rd. Found that all in Springfield OH.  Bs Next to the photographers name it says Albany. I dont think MrBeardedBread will give us such an easy clue. Maybe its Albany OR? Could be judging by the trees and weather. Thank god I found it in the city center. The first misplaced marker.  Cs An ad for NM wine tours as well as a picture of a Santa Fe style victim in the Casa del Toro. Found it again near the city center. And this time the marker is off by a whole block.  Ds Saw a lawyer magazine of SC and a newspaper clipping of the Greenville News. Outside was a street sign for the Pettigru Rd. and its the office of Sydney Wike. Again  found Pettigru and the street near the city center.  Es License plate says Connecticut and a diploma had the shape of the state. Its the corner of Winter St. so I scanned Hartford for a Winter St. and found none. Thinking it could be near I found a Winter St. in Manchester right by Hartford. This marker was also misplaced.  ,geoguessr,d6jy469,2,t5_2x85i

9036576,0,t3_53y76k,   s US. Three minutes left and only small town of Reed. One minute east and pinpoint quality. Thanks Oklahoma.  stars. s Blurry US. This time going east was a dead end. First thought Colorado but then thinks it might be further east. West would have been better.  star. s Canada. Going west and seeing sign for SK in Wakaw. Started somewhere east of Wakaw Lake but the side roads were unnamed in Google maps that hindered trying to pinpoint.  stars.  s Brazil. We are close to BR and in Sao Paulo state. Chooses wrong side of state since I couldnt find Icem.  stars.  s Photosphere cool green house. The text suggests Indonesia or maybe Malaysia.

9245870,0,t3_546fkb,. s A Russian town looking slightly more European than average. Got some  license plates which I was fairly sure meant St Petersburg. Since this is RLT I figured we had to be somewhere special and the island of Kronshtadt looked exactly like the kind of location I expect in this challenge. Guessed in the middle of its urban part and wasnt far!. s An aweinspiring trail on some hill overlooking the sea. Went downhill as its usually easier to find clues that way but found very little. I noticed that the guy holding the trekker had black skin considering that the sun was clearly north of us we probably were south of the equator in Africa. Knowing there is some imagery of this sort in Madagascar I guessed near its western coast... but the water I saw wasnt the sea but actually Lake Tanganica!. s Blurry desert... with snow. Ive had this kind of imagery before in Nevada but it could also be somewhere else... kept going north until I found route markers which I could sortof read and it looked like we were along NV which I found at the last second. Hastily moved my pin along it not too far off.. s Desert very red soil. The roadpaint is undoubtedly Australian. Experience saved me on Round  but tricked me on this one had this kind of landscape in northeastern WA before so I guessed there... especially as I found a marker placing me  kms away from KU which I believed to be Kununurra. We were in the middle of the country instead... the most conservative of guesses wouldve been a bargain here!. s Southeastern Asian script but this didnt feel like Thailand or Cambodia too much... when I found Laotian flags I understood why! A business offered air balloon rides over Vang Vieng a town I found north of Vientiane I ran out of time before determining where around it I started but I wasnt too far.,geoguessr,d8nzcdj,1,t5_2x85i

9451537,0,t3_569hh2, Its been quite a while since I last had a perfect score!. s Small town in a mountainous setting. Found a BC Transit bus shelter Ive seen similar ones on Vancouver Island. Signs placed me between Duncan Youbou and Honeymoon Bay found them the only choice in the middle was Lake Cowichan. Started at the western end of Oak Ln.. s The water tower placed me in Rosetown. Went south and quickly got to a major intersection between SK and SK west of Saskatoon. Easily spotted it and guessed north of it on Little Flower Ave just west of the junction with SK.. s Flat environment just west of the junction between my road AB and ABA. Kept going east and got to the Peace River Airport... I can locate the town of the same name in northern Alberta and I spotted the airport nearby. ABA wasnt marked as such but there was just one intersection west of the airfield so I had no choice! Guessed just west of it near a muddy driveway.. s A long straight road between farms. Went north and quickly got to an highway interchange Exit  between Vancouver and Hope. Scanned it and found the right intersection near Chilliwack. There were plenty of driveways which made pinpointing a bit confusing but I started near the only one with a road mapped on Street View which meant it had to be on the map. There was only one driveway branching off to the west north of the way junction in Atchelitz guessed near it it was the right one!. s Suburbs suburbs suburbs. Spent a lot of time trying to get out of them. Got to the main road discovering I was in Owen Sound. Route markers mentioned ON and ON I can locate the former and I scanned it until I found the right town. Started to the northwest of the town centre on th St W south of its northern end the junction with rd St. Managed to pinpoint at the very last second it was quite dramatic!,geoguessr,d9e1rtq,1,t5_2x85i

10969535,0,t3_5wmf79,I got  points.    s Its apparently some WWII memorial in a temperate climate. I immediately thought of the southern hemisphere despite the photographers name. I wanted to go with Norfolk Island between Australia and NZ because of the pine trees but decided against it because of the harborriver delta so I scanned the eastern Australian coast and saw by scanning the coast northwards from Wollongong on that in Newcastle everything seemed to fit. Even the fort. Wow secs left.  s Not much here except its a tropical park of some kind. I dont know why but I immidiately thought of Brunei so I searched for a nice park in Bandar Sewri Begawan.  s A high school in the US or Canada judging by the cars and the street sign. I thought Grand Island Nebraska is okay. Im pretty pleased with that guess.  s Thats the Parque Nacional dos Lenis Maranhenses without a doubt the only desert in the world with freshwater pools all around. But where in that enormous area? I went conservative and it paid off.  s Oh wow that was a big fuck you from the sun. I thought of the Northern Marianas until I checked the sun because its an official Google picture and it was slightly but obviously to the north so I went with Fiji. Damn that ruined my wouldbegoodscore. But somehow good that I didnt go with the Pitcairn Islands as it crossed my mind for a short time.  ,geoguessr,debfhr3,1,t5_2x85i
