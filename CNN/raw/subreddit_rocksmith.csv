1675,0,t3_1u4vlp,I have been doing Rocksmith for  Years now and things are just coming together!That isnt to say you wont progress you will. But you can always get better. Chords will take time. I took a week to learn the bends in a Tom Petty song from the first game  an entire week for one song section. Now though that I did that bends are easier and I learn them faster. You will too. Stick with it. The beginning is the hardest part. You will get better. ,rocksmith,ceemnne,3,t5_2skou
3467,0,t3_1u5z7l,I havent used it and cant vouch for it but I saw a bunch of people on here saying that theyre using a crack to make it work without the Rocksmith cable and plugged up to a microphone jack on sound card.  I think this is it.  Im guessing it probably works with a USB mic like that as well.  Thats for the  version Im sure theres a similar hack for the original one too.,rocksmith,ceetz8i,3,t5_2skou
6887,0,t1_cef5fgr,uElectricInstinct pretty much nailed it. When I first got my Epiphone I didnt like the pickups much so I decided to put a Seymour Duncan SH  pickup in the neck and a Seymour Duncan SH JB Humbucker pickup in the bridge. They set me back about  in total but it was worth it for the better tone. I would have to agree that you should probably test some different ones out if you can before you purchase though definitely one thing I wish I did instead of just ordering straight offline without ever playing it myself went solely off of videos of others playing it. ,rocksmith,cef7yd8,2,t5_2skou
13379,0,t3_1u9ksu,Only you can teach you how to play guitar without your commitment to learning an instrument and gaining an understanding of music youre not going to get anywhere. I think that if Rocksmith had to be perfectly honest with their slogan it would be more like A way to learn some things about playing guitarThat said I think that there is a lot for people of most skill levels in Rocksmith .  If you are completely new Rocksmith has a lot to offer in terms of lessons games and fun ways to keep you interested and learning. As an intermediate player its really helped me with physical and mental endurance can you play a song repeatedly note for note with high accuracy? song structure and managing tempo thanks Session Mode!.  I dont play any of the games and found most of the lessons to be pretty easy but I love learning songs and Session Mode is pretty useful.My friend who is a very skilled player just thinks that its fun.  Anyway I think that if you go into Rocksmith expecting to become a pro overnight youll be disappointed but if you use it as a learning suppliment and grind it out for a couple of years you can find yourself well set in a pretty rewarding hobbycareer.Im sure that there are many people who wont find any use for the game and thats totally fair too.  ,rocksmith,cefyh9n,2,t5_2skou

That being said it is difficulty to pass not to play perfectly so some songs are out of order but in general it reflects how hard the songs are. Most of the tier  ones arent too bad though they might have one thing you need to pick upmy own summer has a lot of shifting on just one string,rocksmith,cepe8ij,1,t5_2skou

People who have lag problems on the PC generally  Didnt read the manual  Have hardware with shit drivers.I hope its obvious that this is something a new version of the game cant fix.I hate to bring it to you but if you skipped out on Rocksmith  because of random people most of which failed to read the manual this notably includes most professional reviewers complained about lag youve taken one of the best tools to improve your guitar practice away for really really dumb reasons.gtDoes the game force you to use proper technique or is it easy to develop lazybad habits?Its not a teacher. It can show you how to do things properly in the lessons but if you end up winging it it cant tell unless youre actually missing notes. It notably allows you to be pretty sloppy with rhythm.gtFinally how hard is it to transition from using the system to straight up guitar playing? Will my playing be kind of chained to the system?What is straight up guitar playing? You play Rocksmith with a real guitar playing real songs.You mention the Krenz course later on. Note that he teaches with traditional music notation. This is relatively uncommon for guitar players which tend to use tabulature. Rocksmith is much closer to tabulature but wont teach you to read traditional sheet music.gt Im hoping that Rocksmith is a product that will force me to spend more of my time practicing and less time screwing around.Rocksmith wont force you to do anything but playing real rock songs with the backing of the full band and the original amp sounds is way more motivating for practice that noodling out dumbed down versions of folk songs. Im not a big fan of the Krenz course. Did you know they got sued by the FTC and lost for false advertising and astroturfing?,rocksmith,cevuth2,5,t5_2skou

160478,0,t3_1vx1x3,Well I got the game a week and a half ago and I just got a guitar a week before that so Ive been learning with Rocksmith.Ive checked several songs and Im focusing on three The Ramones  Blitzkrieg Bop La sera  Love thats gone didnt know this song and its really nice! and The kinks  You really got me.Blitzkrieg Bop seems to be the easiest but I cant get the rhythm right and its a bit too fast but I keep trying.Love thats gone was nice at first and since it seemed so slow I thought itd be easy but now its getting way too complicated as they added more chords and I have change a lot from frets and strings but I like the song so Ill keep trying.And last night I tried learning You really got me apparently its just playing a few chords again and again it seemed easier than Blitzkrieg Bop just because its a bit slower and probably the difficulty has yet to raise a lot more but I really like it and Im gonna keep playing it!So those are my three songs that I think Ill try learning before moving on to something different.Also do you guys focus on one song and try to learn it perfectly or do you get tired and eventually try learning a couple or more different songs before learning one of them perfectly? Because after a while I just get a bit tired of a song if I have been playing it for over an hour.,rocksmith,cewpmiu,2,t5_2skou
173340,0,t3_1w23g7,The game did you a favor honestly. Ok Im just joking I know it sucks to not be able to play instantly.Seriously though Chinese factory strings are known from being pretty bad. Keep in mind these things sometimes sit in a box for many months and by the time you buy it the strings are dead. Go to local music shop and get some Ernie Ball Elixir DAddario GHS Dunlop or of the many other brands people prefer. String preference is definitely a personal thing. I personally use different strings depending on the guitar.Also if it makes you feel better pretty much anyone whos ever played a guitar snapped a string due to over tightening at some point in their learning experience so definitely dont take it like a oh no I just got it and already I broke it and need replacement parts its all regular maintenance.,rocksmith,cey6cpi,4,t5_2skou

You can then plug any guitar cable you like into the inout and have the other end plugged into your guitar. Press the A and B button. Youre not using any guitar cable to feed signal into ABY switch which then splits it into two signals. One going to Rocksmith one going to your Amp. If you dont feel like using your amp you can just press the A or B switch and have it only output to Rocksmith. Either way the cable plugged into your guitar is now just a normal guitar cable so you can use whatever length or style you like. Your rocksmith cable experiences little to no movement as its plugged into a pedal.You dont have to use the Morley unit. There are other switches that do the same thing and might be cheaper.

1948156,0,t3_2gyr2n,I would get something cheap maybe from a local pawn shop. You need to start learning first to see if youre willing to commit to the guitar. Another bonus of buying a used guitar is you can resell it for a full refund of your money if you either give up or decide to trade up to a better guitar. I would avoid guitars with a tremolo bar because those go out of tune much easier than those without. Keep in mind that when you first put new strings on your guitar they take time to settle as they stretch and they will constantly go out of tune for about an hour of playing this is normal so dont get frustrated by it. Also when you string your guitar make a fist and lay it on the guitar and string the tuners over your fist this allows enough slack for the tuners to properly wind without breaking the string.

In the mixer found in settings as well as when you pause a song lower the song volume to about  so that you can hear yourself more clearly. That way you can hear if youre playing something right or if the detection wasnt as accurate.If you have an amplifier consider getting a ysplitter cable Lower your guitar volume to  in the mixer and just play over your amp.

2658109,0,t3_2qezw5,for a personal recommendation Id say something from Ibanezs Gio line. you should be able to find one in your price range. Gios are a little nicer than most beginners guitars and even a good choice for a second guitar for many people. but other than that there are really tons of good choices for beginner guitars so ill just give some general tips.  avoid stage packs or starter kits. these usually come with a lot of accesories like strap cords pics a DVD or something maybe a tuner and usually an amp. all those things normally cost money and they cant throw them in for free...so where do you think they get the money? it comes out of the cost of the guitar...most of those pack guitars are just total trash. dont let yourself end up with trash just because of the convenience of everything in one box. buy used if you can. guitars dont wear much.  of the wear on a guitar is cosmetic if at all. most guitars play as well as the day they were new maybe better if the previous owner had a setup done and even it needs a setup it isnt that expensive. a lot of experienced guitar players do their own setup. new guitars are always coming out so used guitars keep dropping in price...but they play as good as when they were new. seems silly to buy something new from my perspective. check craigslist or whatever they have in your country maybe the classifieds in the newspaper. check pawn shops. have fun shopping around. you can get a much better guitar with better sound better features better quality if you buy used over buying new. get something that will make you excited to play. if you want a B.C. Rich Warlock because the pointy bits are totally badass to you then get one of those. if you want to play guitar because you think Slash is the best guitar player ever and your in love with the way he wails on a sunburst les paul then get a sunburst les paul. get whatever is going to make you want to pick it up as soon as you get home and not want to put it down. this will help keep you motivated to play. starting out can be really tough. the biggest reward is being able to play things that sound good to you. thankfully rocksmith helps with that...but for many people its still a bit of a struggle and it can take a little time before they can start to play anything rewarding...so just having a guitar they really like so they practice more can help them get to that point.,rocksmith,cn5jlbx,8,t5_2skou

This is especially easy with drop D since the string is under less tension. If you pick it more cleanly it might help.

3892388,0,t1_cqzxshi,gt Tell me what crime Im committing if I rip a CD and tab a song.None if you do it for your own personal use. But if you distribute copies of your CD andor tab things get much murkier fast. Right or wrong for good or for ill whether obsolete or not copyright is essentially the right to make or distribute copies of a thing.Under the law ripping a CD is making a copy as most people know and understand. But also under the law transcribing a song and creating sheetmusic or a tab of it is also making a copy. So both the ripping and the tabbing are creating copies protected by copyright under US law and many others. Now US law allows you to rip CDs and to create tabs and sheet music for your own personal use assuming you own or have a license to use the recording in the first place. But it doesnt necessarily allow you to sell or to give away those copies nor to upload them to youtube nor to reformat them and distribute them as Rocksmith CDLC etc. The exceptions and qualifiers to copyright can be complex and highly situationdependent. The whole notion of copyright is probably due for a major rethink because laws written to govern things like discrete paper copies can produce some ridiculous effects in the realm of digital information. But until that rethink happens the law considers an unauthorized digital distribution of a tab or mp to be essentially the same as a pirated CD sold on a streetcorner or an illegal printing of a book. ,rocksmith,cqzyspd,6,t5_2skou

If its doable keep it and slow way down. If its not I set RR to zero and play the song bit by bit.  Play a song mode is set to start wherever your RR is. This is also helpful if you want some but not all of the notes back. Also RS is a great big ole fun tool. But it cant be your only tool. Dont be afraid to branch out.

4066290,0,t3_36kmwk,My son was having this problem regularly and he solved it  of the time by playing the string while tuning not just plucking. So he plays the open string continuous  notes and tunes.  Basically you are tuning to the average of the string as its being played which is much closer to what Rocksmith is hearing during a song.  Since most lowE strings have a large amount of travel when they are ringing out that average makes a BIG difference on bass.  Ive started using that technique on guitar as well and its made a marked difference in how often it recognizes my playing!  Cheers!,rocksmith,crjsalf,2,t5_2skou

As long as the pickup is functioning correctly you should be good to go regardless of design or manufacturer. That said Id say a G is a great value if you decide to go that way but as Junk suggests strap one on at a local store and check the ergonomics  its the one thing you cannot change later.

4473828,0,t3_3cb6ns,In its current form no. Granted there could be some things I could learn if I really wanted to put in the time like scales and more chords but as an actual teaching device it could use to have lessons on theory. I came into Rocksmith very familiar with the basics so its mainly been a jamming device for me. My biggest issue currently is I understand scales and chord progression are important yet I fail to feel compelled to learn all of that. Theory helps connect the dots to help you truly grasp the process of creating music and how it all forms together. Rocksmith has certainly improved my playing ability when it comes to faster songs but I cant say Im any further in understanding how concepts all fit together. ,rocksmith,csulj81,2,t5_2skou

4624269,0,t1_ctde8lb,Not trying to hijack the thread but about a year ago I bought my first guitar and it was a semi cheap Epiphone LP Special and I thought it looked fine to my beginner eyes. However I have since found out that the simple wraparound bridge is not very nice you cant adjust single string intonation and the strings are actually cutting small grooves into the bridge. On your Special II there is both the wraparound tail piece and then the individual s for the strings but I guess such a setup cannot be implemented on my guitar right? There are only two threaded holes for a bridge piece. Do you know if t here are any better bridges that would fit my guitar?I also cant get my action very low without getting buzzrattling but I guess thats another issue entirely I should probably create my own thread somewhere.PS. There are two volumetone controls but I cannot for the life of me figure out if one furthest away from the bridge is broken or I am just stupid. There is no change between  and  in rocksmith or with an external amp.,rocksmith,ctdgo6f,1,t5_2skou

4656552,0,t1_cthg47u,Sure what would you like to know? I will do my best. Basically they are the most fundamental guitar chords. These are the chords that unlock the fretboard and are in most songs. Thus they allow you to play crummy guitar for decades on end. P Seriously. You can literally get by in any sing along situation on just these chords alone. They are that easy universal and useful. Heres   a good article about them. You can see from the chord notes that the reason playing A for example on all six strings works is because st and th string are the same scalechord note. Open position D works on all six strings because E and A are tones in the D major scaletriad. A is the th note of the D scale.So for accuracy you should try to only play  or  strings as indicated. But in practicality its super okay if you cant really do that yet.  Edit clarity. ,rocksmith,cthimcx,2,t5_2skou

4764786,0,t3_3g4ch2,I had this exact problem also by the sounds of it as soon as Im not on my phone Ill update this with what I was able to do to fix it. In the meantime go right into the rocksmith folder in steamapps and run the rocksmith.exe to verify that the game starts without steam being involved. My issue was the overlay being a dick. OK I made it to a computer. If you have the same problem as me the game runs fine straight from the executable as I mentioned above but when I tried to run it via Steam it crashed every time with the same kernel errors in event log which narrowed it down to a problem with Steam specifically. I ran several repairs and a complete reinstall of Rocksmith compatibility mode changes ran as administrator all to no avail. Eventually I ended up disabling the steam overlay for Rocksmith in the game properties of steam. In the rocksmith.ini I also changed fullscreen to  so it would run windowed. Should also mention that its a good idea to make a back up of your profile while youre messing around with things just for peace of mind. Should be located in ltSteam Installation DirectorygtSteamuserdataltSteam User IDgt. If you have  hours into the game as I and Im sure many others have it would be a shame to lose all of that. Once the overlay was disabled and the program was running windowed I was then able to start the game from the steam shortcut. I closed the game reenabled fullscreen and steam overlay from the properties and its worked great from that point on. Im pretty sure that was the thing that ended up fixing it but I was in the middle of changing so many things to get it to work that I may have inadvertently fixed it otherwise. Give it a try anyways certainly beats reinstalling steam from scratch which btw you can just turn steam off rename your steam program directory reinstall steam then change the games directory back to the proper path and steam will figure it out without having to download everything or install them again.  Good luck either way. Hopefully someone in here gets you going!,rocksmith,ctv58u4,1,t5_2skou

The other big one the last couple years is reading music.  I read every day for a little bit.  Started just with  minutes of reading even if I only read a couple lines of music.  Easy level is fiddle tunes harder stuff is tango music choro and lately some classical.  Besides that where I live are lots of bluegrass jams and also I get together every week or two with some people to read through tango lead sheets and sometimes some old timey jazz.  The bluegrass gives me motivation for the pentatonic thing and the tango motivation for reading.  disclaimer  actually I dont use rocksmith at all!  But I was writing a similar game at one time so I follow this subreddit. ,rocksmith,cvsozmw,2,t5_2skou

Just sat in a back room collecting dust.Last month when I saw Rocksmith   Cable on sale for  I couldnt find any excuse to not pick it up. I let it sit for a while and finally decided to give it a whirl last week. Needless to say I have been hooked even dropped the money I had budgeted for VR stuff on an Epiphone Les Paul plustop.My fingers were pretty beat after playing  or  hours straight on the first day so I took a day off and let them get better. The next time I played It wasnt nearly as bad and though its just been a week my fingers dont bother me at all anymore when I play.My Schedule  mins  Warmup usually starts with me just diddling with some stuff I learned last time before I start the game.  mins  Arcade games namely the duck and saloon one. They have helped a lot with my fingers going where they need to without looking.   mins  Learn a song until I feel the Plateau.   mins  Justinguitar andor in game lessons.

Although there is an accent on one of the up strums but it is without a chord change. You can see the major down strums where the lines are in the note highway. The first beat usually has the fret numbers.Also there is a swing to the beat so the upstrum is closer to the next downstream than it would be for straight eighth notes. It can take some practice to get that part down. I would look it up on youtube justinguitar and practice the strum with muted strings.,rocksmith,czb9ns4,1,t5_2skou

Before I switched to playing bass its how I went about it and didnt notice many problems. My strings didnt get spaghetti until B Standard since I used thicker gauge strings.For bass Id have to agree because on a bass there is a significant difference in string tension between the ED tunings. Not as much as going from E to C but its definitely noticeable. Though of course I need higher gauge strings on my bass.I really think this posts subject matter has every bit to do with laziness.

This can also be achieved by the pedals others mention.Where it differs is that each string can have its own transposition. Eg just the th string a tone lower to give drop D. Or E to D A to G e to d DGB unchanged to give a Open G tuning. Or whatever. All at the turn of a switch. Some alternate tunings are built in. Or you can add your own.,rocksmith,d1g78vl,7,t5_2skou

The Rocksmith developers even know it exists and they are fine with it as long as some rules are followed.Anything on the Rocksmith store sold via DLC can not be distributed on the Customs Forge.  The Forge does a really good job at making sure that there are no conflicts in that case.  Every time new DLC comes out the person or persons running the Forge go through and make sure to take down all songs that come out as official DLC.There is a program in where you can create songs for use as CDLC as well.  I think there are links to the program in the side bar.  Its was people use to create and submit songs to the Forge.Also some of the songs in the Forge are interpretations of how a user thinks the song is played.  I have many songs that sound close to the original but are definitely short a few notes here and there.  So the quality isnt always up to par with official DLC.  ,rocksmith,d1yqa4o,1,t5_2skou

7301577,0,t1_d27pn3x,well Vice city and Rocksmith are both video games...though gamers might not put them in the same boat really...they would be to rights holders. so these rights holders are used to and open to the idea of licensing to video games. it could be that whoever at Ubi is paying attention to that. also they might figure most of the songs on Vice city would require about the same amount of cash to license...so at least they know they are all in the same ballpark. if this is the case I really hope they move onto getting rights from songs in the game Brutal Legend. not just the dozen or so on the soundtrack but there is actually over  badass songs in the game i think.,rocksmith,d2851iy,2,t5_2skou

Hello I would like an official fretboard with notes. I would also ask what is their philosophy regarding the next rocksmith game. RS to RS was revolutionary in terms of creating a successful game. I dont think there is much to do in terms of playability. RS has a loyal fan base but the game only teaches to imho an advanced beginner level. If and when RS comes out it should build upon not replace RS so that current players continue to be challenged New music only goes so far.
