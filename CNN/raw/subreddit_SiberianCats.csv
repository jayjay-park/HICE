10348414,0,t1_dcgtbs1,Thank you for sharing your experience. I do have clinical proof that my cat had FIP so I am not sharing a false statement my intention is to bring transparency of disease incidence not purposely harm anyone or any business. Each person has the right to make their own decision in choosing a breeder but people should have access to factual information in which to make that determination. If a customer is told there has never been any cases of FIP and that statement later turns out to be wholly inaccurate then I might suggest if anyone had any legal argument here it would be the countless number of cat buyers who have lost thousands of dollars and suffered emotionally. Disease  mortality rate seems like a valid and objective metric for a cat buyer to use to ascertain which breeder they want to buy their cat from.  Today the American Veterinary Medical Association published a report on the responsibility of breeders of companion animals in relation to genetic disease so from this group they do see a connection. Genetic disease in pedigree cats and dogs is getting worse not better.   ,SiberianCats,dch1wgp,2,t5_362ac
