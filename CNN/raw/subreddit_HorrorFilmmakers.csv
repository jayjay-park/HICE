7028055,0,t3_4bvi9k,Its an old uninformative blog posting really.  The mantra that it doesnt matter what you shoot on is only true if youre shooting just to learn or for fun with friends and with no aspirations beyond uploading to Youtube or the like.  If you have any desires beyond that it most definitely matters.  If you raised money from people who expect though they really shouldnt to get a return it most definitely matters.  If you need digital effects of any worth it definitely definitely matters.  And if you plan to get distribution it matters.There have been notable exceptions where otherwise bad or cheap cameras have been used on a film that has both gotten widespread acclaim and distribution.  But that will almost invariably have some kind of name attached to it either director making a statement about being experimental or actors involved or some element of gimmickry or hype ie. first movie shot on an iPhone first movie shot on a GoPro etc..  The slack given to celebrity does not apply to you.  This is not a fair and honest trade or market with precedents set and then respected. Shoot on the best thing you can get and have realistic expectations for where it can go.  That said good audio means more to your film than a good looking image.,HorrorFilmmakers,d1czeqo,0,t5_30mh5
