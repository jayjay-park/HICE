Youre in a good situation but the Finnish system tries to guarantee proper health care for those who are financially weak and not employed. Safety net is the term used often as no one can predict their future and what kind of financial or health catastrophes they might face. This adds up to relatively high taxes but Finns are so used to the system that its rare even for richer people to demand dismantling the public health system.,awesome,cnxx23o,3,t5_2qhgc

If theyre going really fast they can do a really wide loop so they will be upside down for a long time but upside down on a straight road is impossible.Yes I know the faster you go the flatter the curve you drive upside down on can be. There is another force the car can use to drive perfectly upside down. Its air friction. Air bounces off the car upward pushing it into the road. This article talks about that and it mentions . gs just as you did. This is still just a theory though. The forces work out but until its proven with practice Im not going to fully believe it.
