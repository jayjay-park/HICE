1069492,0,t1_chpurnf,I dont know. Just I feel that its a waste of a stang to get the pony package and smaller engine. That car looks like a monster and deserves to have the core of one too.Stand by the same opinion with Dodge Chargers or Challengers. Like Id rather work my ass off and spend several extra months or years getting a .L Hemi V Challenger instead of a .L V.,BurlingtONTARIO,chputhe,1,t5_31kqb
