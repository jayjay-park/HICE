8817030,0,t1_d77902a,Thats what its looking like to me. Aside from the occasional Rogue quest for us to go steal something... I have yet to see any good rewards from pickpocking. RIP,warcraftrogues,d77or1v,1,t5_366qh
9394228,0,t3_58cq4v,Are you simming your specs? Unless you have bags worth of gear for each three specs then Im pretty sure youre not optimised.As a first point of call Id say sim yourself. Figure out what you should be doing then work from there. Its likely that if your gear isnt optimised youre missing out on a lot of damage.Also it seems that youre focusing on using all three specs. Currently I feel you should pick one and start getting your weapon invested in. If youre throwing AP around all three specs youre going to be missing out on traits in each weapon that are probably going to help your DPS.In regards to Sin rotation you should never be spamming envenom. Yes you want to keep your EP up as much as possible but its not about spamming envenom. If youre running Exag your first priority is keeping your bleeds up  of the time. If you have spare points yes drop them in envenom.,warcraftrogues,d96s99c,1,t5_366qh

10266548,0,t3_5mqmsa,I use Ghostly Strike.  It is a simple buff that gives you a  damage increase.  DryPersonality has the rotation but I throw in a GS after Ambush.  RtB you ideally want to have two buffs minimum so reroll if you dont.  If you want to optimize then TB is a huge thing.  If I get a TB with  other buffs I almost always pop AR and Curse.  By the time TB is over AR is usually off or almost off cooldown. Something else I had to accept was that not every boss or battle is Outlaw friendly.  When it is not my dps is good but not as good as it could be.  When it is a great fight for Outlaw though I can pump out a load of damage. ,warcraftrogues,dc7rpc0,2,t5_366qh
