15583,0,t1_ceg4xei,Thanks for clearing up my confusion.Does training time consume VMX Compute Hours or only running detectors which have already been blessed and saved?How hardandfast is the line between training and detecting? Are object detectors constantly updated as new candidate images and feedback on detection performance is received? Is it even possible to provide such feedback in detect mode?,computervision,ceg7ib2,1,t5_2rfzn

769792,0,t1_cgrmc5j,Maybe just have a skeleton of the letters FPS i.e. remove all the ornaments from the letters and maybe a few layers of edge pixels until you get the centre of each stroke. There will be some peak somewhere in your convolution which corresponds to lining up the skeleton with the letters in the image.Having said all that it occurs to me that a much faster approach will be to look for the corner points of the F. Then look for the corner points of the downstroke of the P. There wont be much ambiguity  if an area scores high for that its almost definitely the F and the P from FPS.,computervision,cgrs3bz,2,t5_2rfzn

1151545,0,t3_25f7zt,A suggestion. Try and limit the recognition to a limited set of insects. Thats going to make things a bit easier on you.Im guessing you only want to kill bugs that you would classify as pests. So only look for pests. Once you get that done you might want to add the ability to locate and classify insects that arent in the existing list of pests so you can see if you are short on beneficial insects or something unexpected has shown up.One other thing. Think about separating the detection and targeting. Maybe have one camera and processor that searches for bad bugs and then points the kill system at the offending insect which then takes over. ,computervision,chz5vt2,1,t5_2rfzn

It seems like massive overkill for what youre trying to do but you might end up there depending on your requirement for artistic.You can consider seam carving if you want to scale down but would prefer to retain more of the image content. If youre only cropping a little bit it will work well but it tends to do strange things if you force it to remove too much contentYou can also use the same concept of an energy function to decide which parts of an image are most cropable but take them as absolutes for left  right  top  bottom instead of routing wiggly lines to carve.

3342289,0,t1_cp6x6ok,Thanks ugrants!!I enjoyed reading your paper on LineBased Structure From Motion for Urban Environments Unfortunately the solution discussed in the paper relays heavily on at least two widely separated views of the scene. My problem stems from the augmented reality challenge of extracting information from a single frameimage. as ulneutral mentioned the problem is much better described as a registration problem between the D BIM and D image rather then a recognition or feature extraction problem.I want to thank you for considering this problem and offering up these references and thoughts I find that often just the act of bouncing ideas off each other can get you pretty far in problem solving so I appreciate your time and your interest in this challenge!I hope I can return the favour in the future. ,computervision,cp98us8,1,t5_2rfzn
3433634,0,t1_cpjnfqh,I still think Gaussian convolution kernels can be evaluated more quickly without FFT because they have a number of special properties.There are a few reasons for this Gaussian kernels quickly die out to  away from the center which means that the kernel can be quite a bit smaller than the image. This makes the convolution operation a lot cheaper although it also means we only operate on the low frequency components but Im not sure how much that would save you on the FFT. The d Gaussian convolution filter is separable into two dimensional filters.  Each of these dimensional filters is much faster to compute because if the d kernel was n by n the d factor is  by n. For very large kernels theres often a speed up to be had based on the knowledge that applying a Gaussian convolution kernel more than once is equivalent to applying a large kernel. Because of this its possible to evaluate a large kernel by repeatedly convolving with a small kernel.,computervision,cpjnrus,3,t5_2rfzn

You as a user dont have any control of this. We have no idea what wurstify does with the proxied images.I know a lot of people who wouldnt be happy about that.

Assuming your robot is always at the same altitude then this is enough for you to estimate the position of the robot with some error.The error will stem from the fact that these are not ellipses but the perspective projections of the ellipses onto a fisheye so the centers we get the image ellipse center and the image of the real ellipse center are different.,computervision,d7ffcg9,2,t5_2rfzn
