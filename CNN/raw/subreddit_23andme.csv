6439252,0,t1_czl1i36,I was worried it might come off that way. However why even invest time money and energy into building a working prototype if you know people wont use it? Its a side project for both people involved and doesnt need to be completed if the interest isnt there. Better to know now than  months down the road no?Thats why the main purpose of the link is to get people to fill out the  question survey and add any feature wishes to our wish list even wishes that the app not be built at all!!. Both are anonymous. For all its worth the newsletter will be for updates on the research Im doing probably summaries of individual research papers that will then be synthesized into  pagesgene for the real app.  The intention is to produce something thats hopefully both educational and entertaining at the same time and to help people stretch the data contained in andMe files just that little bit further. I promise not to spam anyone. I am a living breathing human being just like all the rest of you or reddit would have weeded me out by now!.,23andme,czlcvgm,2,t5_2scn9

7109930,0,t3_4cxouh,If youre not European its only really worth it if you take the time to learn what to do when you get your results. andme data is compatible with a lot of different sites that let you upload your DNA and analyze it with their algorithms.The best way to get more specific ancestry information is the site GEDmatch which has an admixture tool. There are also sites like promethease which give more health info for a small fee.,23andme,d1maj5r,4,t5_2scn9

7941990,0,t3_4nr75a,Im sorry friend but it is nonexistent. It can be a bit hard to hear for some people but the most likely reasons are either that someone cheated down the line of your family tree or the man simply wasnt German.  I just do not think it is at all likely for you to not have any German DNA from what sounds like a greatgrandfather by your  estimate.  Keep in mind it only takes one incidence of infidelity to wipe out the connection between you and an ancestor.  There are always other possibilities of course though the number of other possible reasons are just far too numerous to speculate on.  ,23andme,d48r56u,0,t5_2scn9

9369747,0,t3_58vuh5,That is such a small percentage that it could be error. Or it could be that some African person from a long time ago lived in China and had sex with one of your ancestors. ,23andme,d93okly,9,t5_2scn9

11034143,0,t1_decgfd7,The only issue with this is that an additional set of data for each base pair that turns out different the question becomes which one is right? I know those two SNPs are wrong but what about the rest? One would need a minimum of  sets of data to get even  confidence in the results. So in the end an additional run is likely to create more questions than answers.,23andme,deip19u,3,t5_2scn9

11207285,0,t3_5zz50i,I dont like to completely rule out those percentages as background static even on andme. One thing to remember about European Jews or Ashkenazi is that throughout history their culture were usually endogamous and intermarried with other people of Ashkenazi descent so that . could be a saturated segment from one of your ancestors. If it is not a fragment of someone close like a grandparent then I would rather say your hypothetical Ashkenazi ancestor lived further than  generations back perhaps  and thats assuming an even split of DNA. I would also pay attention to any DNA under French and German in andmes report as it can blend in with that Ashkenazi through geographical relations.,23andme,df2bzur,5,t5_2scn9

11542326,0,t3_64qynp,I have an idea of what youre going through. Im  and was born from a sperm donor and just found out that my half brother who I thought shared the same donor as me isnt related to me at all. The doctor who inseminated my mom switched the sperm samples around. He did it to us and he did it to many others some of whom he actually put his own sperm in. It was jarring to hear for sure. I got the shakes. Its tough not having a daddads family for your whole life but you make it work. Hearing that the one link you had to the unknown isnt actually a link at all and is as related to you as the average stranger was the tough part.My mom and I are joining the class action lawsuit currently being placed against the doctor.
