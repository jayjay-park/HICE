7132037,0,t3_4d8hr7,Wait ... Really ? Go buy some RP you can get ravager nocturne  which is pretty good imo with  purchase. We are not here afaik to gift people for no reasons ,nocturnemains,d1ou07w,3,t5_390e0
7506927,0,t1_d2vhqos,I take  flat  scaling CDR. Caps CDR but you just get a tad more earlyat . Taking some scaling MR is fine but with the way I build its not going to save me.Attack speed blues should be reserved for pro ADCs or for some hugely AS reliant jungle picks like Yi. Beyond that I dont think theyre very useful,nocturnemains,d2vhzd3,1,t5_390e0

7743809,0,t1_d3lla95,Yeah and theres no reason for him to not be meta again. He hasnt exactly been nerfed tons since then. Only buffed.,nocturnemains,d3mexyy,1,t5_390e0
7828010,0,t1_d3vnrbp,gt I highly doubt theyd make it a skillshot since that means you could escape with itDid you miss the entire paragraph where I addressed this?  p,nocturnemains,d3vxo6m,1,t5_390e0

8505760,0,t3_4w7aql,Nah thats intended. Nocturnes dash cant be stopped but he can be hit by CC during it. If morgana hits Q on you mid flight you will be binded when you land as well,nocturnemains,d64rwfw,1,t5_390e0
9884052,0,t1_davubx1,Hm I only did the lvl  gank once but I still blew all  enemy Summoner spells and had enough mana to full clear.I dont understand your guys problem.,nocturnemains,davwz6e,1,t5_390e0
10502058,0,t3_5qbrlh,I assume this is jungle Nocturne in which case you should build Warrior as your enchantment if this is the kind of build youre going for. Dont skip the jungle enchantment on Nocturne having a combat smite is super nice and the mana regen in jungle helps more than you might realize.Anyways WarriorIoniansall lethality items was a viable build assuming that full burst on squishies is what is optimal for your game even before . and its only better now. In such a build I suggest a Ravenous Hydra the active is great extra damage in your burst combo and it helps farmclear speed.Duskblades passive base damage got buffed this patch  instead of . So your calculations are a little short.As for lethality vs old armor pen...one of the things in favor of old armor pen was old Youmuus. Having AS on the active was huge for Nocturne and losing it still hurts. Granted the item was kinda broken so Im not complaining too much.,nocturnemains,dcyipke,1,t5_390e0
10640548,0,t1_dddh7fm,Youre really hurting yourself having no attack speed in your runes Id recommend AS quints with either Lethality or AD for marks.,nocturnemains,dddhosb,2,t5_390e0
