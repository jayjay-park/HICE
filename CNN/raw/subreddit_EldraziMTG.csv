6076879,0,t3_3yo7mn,In removing red you mostly lose Bolt and good sideboard options. Mono black is probably at least okay but the best versions of this deck are going to have some kind of splash colour to cover blacks weaknesses. ,EldraziMTG,cyg5waq,1,t5_3bj8t
6373680,0,t1_cze3lii,I think youre only other option is Slag Storm since it only requires R.  Not being able to hit fliers means its no good against Affinity so if youre not worried about that it could work.,EldraziMTG,cze48i2,2,t5_3bj8t
6427207,0,t1_czk20wl,not on me but with descendants path eldrazis have cast triggers when you reveal an eldrazi on upkeep free thoughtknot ulamog and hell even emrakul cast triggers. Keep it creature dense with with eldrazi creatures like Conduit of Ruin and mutavaults to activate on DPs upkeep trigger and you can be searching for your large threats and casting them for free.,EldraziMTG,czk404c,2,t5_3bj8t
7120069,0,t1_d1nficl,That sounds great! I think its the most viable way to play Eldrazi moving forward.,EldraziMTG,d1ngsj7,1,t5_3bj8t
7137990,0,t1_d1pfr2b,Going back to a processor build Blight Herders are great vs control.,EldraziMTG,d1pifs6,4,t5_3bj8t
7137995,0,t3_49a64w,Eye gets the ban!Im actually quite fond of Pascal Maynards BW list Eldrazi and Taxes. Good old BW midrange still viable. Anybody still brewing eldrazis?,EldraziMTG,d1pigip,1,t5_3bj8t
7198838,0,t3_4e0d4f,This is awesome thanks for posting. I dont have anything to contribute other than that and please share more. I love the processor Eldrazi archetype. ,EldraziMTG,d1wg74k,1,t5_3bj8t
