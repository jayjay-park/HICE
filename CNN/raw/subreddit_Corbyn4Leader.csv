11697067,0,t3_66s8vf,Havent found any with sufficient energy or activity either. There are few platforms such as rCorbynForPM and rLabour for general election stuff and rLabour for activism purposes. rLabourUK hasnt been a positive encounter lately. All with quite low subscriber counts. What people should do to my mind is to choose one for starters and concentrate their efforts there. And then spread out when and if it comes necessary and supports communitys needs.,Corbyn4Leader,dglvq73,1,t5_38pgk
