4645611,0,t3_346p4l,My SO sent me this thread for commenting... Im a current Boeing employee who acts as a focal for an internal process at Boeing. The focal role is different depending on what sort of focal you are in my case Im one of about a dozen focals and the only one in my function. My contact information is included on the processs information site and FAQ. In my situation the focal role isnt formal or welldefined  Im basically a very visible SME who fields questions about the process and sometimes conducts demos or training sessions. Its not part of my real job but its on my official development plan and I report back informally to my manager on the focal activities.In other scenarios the focal role is more defined and has more responsibility amp authority.,boeing,ctg56mz,1,t5_2uyxp
