282734,0,t1_cf2fvfy,The fact that your comment even sounds plausible is outrages first time looking at how the game is going in a few month and then saw  New feature Manual target of closest enemy  What in the Fuck how is this not put in prerelease.  god damn dollars ,XRebirth,cfa2i5x,1,t5_2si8z
309600,0,t3_1xd4di,I honestly dont understand the backlash when it comes to entering stations. I understand that it is time consuming but I enjoy the change of scenery from the cockpit. I hope they do something like incorporate the unreal engine and do station combat! Or make it so you can board a cap ship and fight your way to the bridge! This would drastically change the gameplay though and many people may choose to just board and capture ships. It would honestly become two unique but intertwined games. Would be awesome in my opinion though. Come next year....XRebirth Marines....lol...I need to make a fake trailer for that! ,XRebirth,cfcuwc6,0,t5_2si8z
1073456,0,t1_chq38kc,It has nothing to do with bragging rights my computer is worse than his and I get FPS on ultra FPS on low. This game does not run properly. He has a GTX and i he should be getting a minimum of FPS all the time for a game that looks like this.As for framerate I have a hz monitor and I can most certainly see the difference between fps and fps let alone fps and fps. Although I will accept FPS I wont accept lowerTelevision shot at fps or fps is blurred to make the motion more seamless. But if you look at the background of panning shots you can still see the jerkiness. With FPS the blur will make moving objects indistinguishable. Its about time videographers stopped spewing misinformed crap and give us FPS already. I have a Gopro and the difference between fps and FPS is night and day its a shame that uploading to youtube drops it to FPS.My PC can get FPS consistently Capped by Vsync with occasional drops to FPS with Deus Ex Human Revolution yet I cant even manage to stay above FPS with this game. Its time people stopped defending it the performance is pathetic.Heres a link for you to show the differences between framerates withwithout motion blur Obviously if your monitor is only hz going above fps isnt going to have much point but theres a noticeable difference between FPS and FPS.,XRebirth,chqb0sy,1,t5_2si8z
1166909,0,t1_ci0mndn,Thanks for the tips.  Ive already grabbed the rest of the licenses for future mission running but I was hoping there was a way to continue to access the more profitable Secret Service missions at this point.Ive also been progressing in a more vanilla way since I made this post.  I used the roughly  million you get from the Secret Service missions to buy  Recruit Marines and a Marine Officer then went and stole a High Tech freighter from Beryll.  Once I get enough in the bank via piracy Ill start building stations in OL.,XRebirth,ci0wawd,1,t5_2si8z
1686382,0,t1_cjrldyq,Im not overly concerned with combat fleets I usually have one in reserve as a defense force but for the most part I form a trading empire and build factories to further my goals of well I guess i dont have an end game in mind.But being able to command them and get them doing what I want in a pinch is necessary I like that aspect of it.For myself I never liked cap ship piloting. I preferred a Centaur with flak launchers so I could get in there and cause trouble while my destroyers caused all kinds of havoc.I miss the old days.,XRebirth,cjrqe78,1,t5_2si8z

4167663,0,t1_crv4txj,I will be back on monday in the office and try to take a look at the files. If i dont answer here because i probably forgot please write me a pm and ill try to help Additional you could visit our forums forum.egosoft.com and ask this question in the x rebirth scripts and modding subforum. The guys there are usually pretty fast and correct in heling out other modders!,XRebirth,crvbl4s,2,t5_2si8z
5288565,0,t3_3ncocq,The campagin is still broken imo rest of the game is solid,XRebirth,cvnod7r,-1,t5_2si8z
7025746,0,t1_d1bwng2,Yes you can give command to hold fire. I usually need a cap ship to bring the hull down. I havent gotten rich enough where my fleet vs their fleet happened. I have seen some cap ships engage some Xeon attackers which was neat.,XRebirth,d1cpz74,1,t5_2si8z
7641882,0,t3_4jw0ei,XR is in a good state now and well worth checking out. Itll be a great starting point for the announced sequel that will address the chief issues people had with XR such as only one pilotable ship.The only major bugs Ive come across are clipping into stations and asteroids when boosting while under SETA at low FPS.Since release a number of systems have been reworked and missing features were added.The Skunk got a radar display alternate cockpit configurations and an oldfashioned sidebar HUD like the old X games to replace the slow diegetic HUD still available via options.Third person and autopilot got added in update Performance greatly increased though its still annoyingly low in areas with volumetric clouds.SETA and the Jumpdrive returned in update . as craftable upgrades crafting added weapon modifications added i.e. increase rate of fire and more range at the cost of cooling rateHighways now accelerate you to the max velocity instantaneously no need to draft behind traffic to go faster. End result is significantly faster travel.Most missions in a zone can be viewed and accepted from a bulletin board system though lessthanlegal missions like prison breaks must be found the old fashioned way by exploring the station surfaces.AI is less broken. Still does silly thing Egosoft trademark feature but youre less likely to find a trader bumbling around in circles outside a docking port.,XRebirth,d3au8y7,5,t5_2si8z
8108368,0,t1_d4loy7f,What didnt you like about X that made Rebirth better? Im completely new to the whole series and deciding between the X Superbox for  and X Rebirth Complete for  on Steam right now.,XRebirth,d4rgbz6,1,t5_2si8z
8935467,0,t1_d7lvz6q,pretty sure the answer is no.  piloting many different ships was just not the focus for this iteration of the X series,XRebirth,d7lwt4c,2,t5_2si8z
