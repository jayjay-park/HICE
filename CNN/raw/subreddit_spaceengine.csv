Have the files extracted to there. As you do it some of the new files will have the same name as old files. Windows will ask Would you like to overwrite the old file or rename the new one? and you want to select to overwrite the old file thats what will implement the updates. As uVapr commented you might as well do . immediately after following the same steps on the . folder to install the second update.Cant remember where you saved it? Thats fine.

8347721,0,t1_d5l0g1x,This utility is what does it You have to run Space Engine in windowed mode and then you can use the tool to resize the window. Wait about a minute for surfaces to render. If you drag the window to the left it will be bigger than your monitor the top right corner has a loading circle that will stop when everything is fully rendered. Then you take the screenshot and set the window back to normal. ,spaceengine,d5l0nwm,1,t5_2sit9
