11369800,0,t3_627xc6,It could be because theyre the same price?Previously the dealership had a deal that brought the Energi down to about .  According to my math that equates to the price of the Hybrid after all the incentives.  The dealership wanted to get rid of the  model so they offered quite a big incentive.  ,cmaxhybrid,dfkqtwa,2,t5_2vm7q
11624866,0,t3_65jpke,I havent been super diligent with maxing out rangeMPGs on min so between of using heat and AC I normally see  miles of range. If I do kill the climate control Ive seen  miles easy on the dash. Generally the full range is split across  trips each day and I still have range left when I get home and plug in so hard to get an accurate feel for EV range.I did have two trips into town the other day  miles each way  highway on full hybrid and averaged mpg on both trips. And this was in rush hour and spiking the accelerator a handful of times.,cmaxhybrid,dgdov0m,2,t5_2vm7q
