1410587,0,t3_2a9xkc,Id say its as safe as any place big enough that would need a large parking garage.  I follow the Bethlehem police report on Twitter and have never read any trouble.  The people that made a face may have been thinking of South Side Bethlehem which I would be more worried about.  Even though its dark at  in the winter its still a busy area. Ironically Im moving from the corner of New and Elizabeth to Catty which recently had a mugging and string of car break ins. Oh and how I will miss Carls Corner!,lehighvalley,cit3hhf,5,t5_2sjxv

9516601,0,t3_5b2g7o,Downtown Easton is hopping. Baconfest is this weekend its rated in the  festivals in the world and top  in the US I believe.  beds go for about  clams.There are a few projects getting going thatll be done by next year. Primarily the Silk mill redevelopment project is super cool and is going to be amazing when complete. The units will be rentals for  years and then sold as condos.The public market is very nice and every Saturday is the farmers market. The West Ward still needs some work but the Wood Ave cirridir is going to be redone and thats going to turn that area around.The EPD is really going strong on cleaning up the drugs and gangs in the WW too.  Monsters of renting there are opportunities to by property in the cheap and rehab.Id be more than happy to answer any questions about the historic district ,lehighvalley,d9m4gxa,1,t5_2sjxv

10195066,0,t3_5l1swr,Like someone else said Mary Anns Donut Kitchen either in the Allentown Farmers Market or their nearby location.  And yes impossible to buy a Boston Crme donut there after they are open a few hours.  Lots of other types usually but annoyingly they seem to be always out of those ones.For bagels Three Men and a Bagel in Trexlertown is great for bagels.  Blueberry ones are the best!,lehighvalley,dbzo0ju,2,t5_2sjxv
