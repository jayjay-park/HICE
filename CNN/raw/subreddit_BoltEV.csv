9153539,0,t1_d8c93w7,Cool. Thanks for the explanation. Theres a few located . miles away in a mall parking lot.I suspect that the local Chevy dealership will install one since they are part of a huge dealership chain.They sell Nissans Mazdas Fords Jeeps Buicks VWs and Chevys all in a  mile radius.,BoltEV,d8c9zlp,2,t5_35ugq
9564875,0,t1_d9ptg7u,gtassuming the bolt ever sees other markets beyond OregonCalifornia.Why would this be the case?,BoltEV,d9s2f03,2,t5_35ugq
9587839,0,t1_d9uo9e6,gt As it gets even more affordable youll see not only GM but all the other manufacturers start dog piling into the segment.Damn near everyone but Ford has an EV out now or will in the next  months. The Bolt is but one of many including the Nissan Leaf and the Audi ETron. AFAIK almost every other major manufacturer has announced an EV line.,BoltEV,d9uwavf,3,t5_35ugq

10240343,0,t1_dc4r2om,Excellent legwork.  Lets look at these  articles and see what they source for this money loosing revelation.  Well golly look at that.....   according to a Bloomberg report that cites a person familiar with the matter.   Citing anonymous sources familiar with the matter Bloomberg is claiming   The actual Bloomberg article cites their source simply as  according to a person familiar with the matter   Bloomberg   citing sources familiar with the matter   according to Bloomberg. The news service cites an anonymous person familiar with the matter    Bloomberg reports.Ha! You want to try again?,BoltEV,dc4st8e,3,t5_35ugq
10640561,0,t3_5rzbhi,gtIm trying to order the false floor for my new bolt but my dealership cant figure out the part numberOrdering a simple trunk part has got to be one of the single easiest things a dealership can do. Its pretty sad for the employees of your dealership if they cant manage thatnot trying to be mean here just honestly its very weird. Go to a different dealership to order it.,BoltEV,dddhqj6,1,t5_35ugq
10654608,0,t1_dde9du7,Thanks for the link.  Yah I guess there are trade offs as with anything.  I wonder which technology is better at regen  phase induction or permanent magnet?,BoltEV,ddexvrz,1,t5_35ugq

11361171,0,t1_dfi6ic8,Do you need to take out the entire glove compartment like the leaf unless you have a  year old slave,BoltEV,dfjrn92,1,t5_35ugq
11381235,0,t3_62bdbs,   is the sweet spot for my  leaf so I assume the LIION battery in the bolt will probably react the same to cold and freezing temps. Im in PA so we get cold winters.. My average range during cold months with a daily average of low s and nights in low to mid s is around  to  miles which is  miles less than during months of sweet spot weather....,BoltEV,dfm1l79,4,t5_35ugq
11474533,0,t1_dfwbge4,Obviously.  But the MD dealers dont charge MD and DE taxes when purchasing so why would I wait for them to roll out to Delaware in May?  Ive enjoyed my bolt for a month now!,BoltEV,dfwmtld,4,t5_35ugq
11607176,0,t1_dgblkos,Im not sure what you mean but I dont intend to take my Bolt more than  miles maybe  at most between charges.  I always use Hilltop Reserve to limit it to  to avoid wear Tesla recommended  for their S.I do not like to take ICE cars too far below half a tank either since it can wear out the fuel pumps which rely on fuel for lubrication and cooling.  Its a huge job to replace the fuel pump on some cars.,BoltEV,dgbolus,1,t5_35ugq

11771399,0,t1_dguakad,Well it vanished somehow.  Are you the winner that left or attempted to at least the comment on the YouTube video as well?  That sounded awfully similar to you using words like whine for example.Ive noticed that people who use the words whine and millennial tend to be  White obese altright annoyingly vocal about their opinions and generally useless bags of skin.That fit your description?
