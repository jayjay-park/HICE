1504759,0,t3_2bejka,Itd play games decently but the video card is very underpowered for the total price that youre paying.  At that price point you should have no less than an AMD FX  or Intel ii processor and a GTX  or R video card.,suggestapc,cj4w800,1,t5_31y8k

However if youre not using that many programs or installing that many games it should be enough.

5862498,0,t3_3viqc7,The Radeon HD xxx series is roughly six years old and doesnt implement DX. Its going to struggle hard on modern games. It may run FO in the sense that it doesnt crash immediately but its not going to run well The official recommended minimum is a HD  although thats probably a decent bit higher than the bare minimum. AMDs Piledriver codename FXseries and motherboards are dated but still in production and compete aggressively on price as seen in your link. The FX comes from the older no longer available Bulldozer line and should be priced accordingly.Wireless bg is completely worthless. WirelessN adapters with better speed and signal strength are available for less than . Cheap ones with mediocre antennas Ive seen as low as . From someone who buys more used computerscomponents than he should very few things have any kind of warranty or support either theyre too old or its nontransferable and those things have a value.For a final value Id say to go with the linked Cyberpower subtract  or so more if its dustyscratched then add  of the price of the SSD. ,suggestapc,cxo3qor,1,t5_31y8k

10873648,0,t1_de1ew0k,I read for it to look normal thats why I recommend Vanquish . However the one you are purchasing is much more attractive and very compact. I love things that are much more minimalistic. Each of the models come with a GPU unless you can take it out which would be cool if especially if you have your own GPU. If thats the case you also need to make sure your GPU will be compatible.Now for the water cooling its all upon if you want that or a heat sink  that is attached to a fan. I use a heat sink for my cooler about . I live in SoCal and my home is usually around C. My CPU remains around C and with heavy use it goes up to C which is normal.  Usually the temperatures will vary but not by a whole lot. The water cooling looks cool but Id go with a heatsink instead of water cooling. Its also cheaper for you.
