2027,0,t3_1u5cwe,Ok... That was a pretty sad start...  I went outside to call a friend and say happy new year when I remembered I had an Emergency Smoke hidden in our hollow rock outside...  Sadly rather than just destroying it like the rest.  I decided to smoke it.  .  Well at least I dont have to reset my counter...

270909,0,t3_1x57ax,Just found this sub and so far your situation sounds closest to mine. I feel like we are lucky because since we didnt smoke as often as the average smoker there was more time between each cigarette for the nicotine to leave our system before we lit up again and we were able to immediately see how cigarettes change peoples headspace. It really is an instant mental fog that is very similar to mild depression as far as Im concerned. It supposedly takes two hours for half of the nicotine from a cigarette to leave our system which means that heavy smokers have a harder time remembering how they felt before they started smoking because they cant allow enough time between cigarettes to see a contrast.

But I really suffered from the I miss smoking feelings throughout those first five weeks. I did relapse once while out with some friends at a bar and had a yes a singular puff off my friends cigarette and hated it. I realized then that it would have been more trouble than it was worth to actually start smoking again. So I just remind myself of that when I have a craving and it goes away.

Sometimes I get pretty intense cravings but like I said since I am quitting everything at once the lack of knowing which one I am craving exactly makes me just feel anxious but Im not sure about what. When you quit any one of them individually you end up feeling anxious and you know exactly what substance would solve that problem. Since I am not going to go fail at all three at once I just sit thought it a little easier and know that the craving will go away soon enough. I never realized until this quit how quickly cravings really vanish. ,stopsmoking,ciutzlh,2,t5_2rbuf

1514531,0,t1_cj63l9s,I did read the thread and completely understand that this is a forum for addicts trying to kick the habit of smoking Ive been there myself. As a former smoker I searched far and wide for anything that would give me an edge in this battle and found that edge in vaping. Vaping gave me the ability to slowly decrease my nicotine intake at my desired pace and and the ability to still go out with my friends at the bar or wherever and not feel left out when they all went to smoke. Im proud to say that Ive been analog free for almost a year and have no intentions on going back. The reason I added groups like CASAA and SFATA to my post is because without them smokers who make the decision to give quitting a shot might not have the option to use vaping to do so. If they developed a system that would allow alcoholics to quit drinking via a safesafer alternative I would stand for their right to use it and not have it taken away.

It wasnt always that way on all of my previous quits I was white knuckle the whole time until I finally broke down.Two days ago at work I got an urge after dealing with a very difficult customer.  I went down to the smoking area and hung out with the smokers again after not being a regular for about  months I never started going back to smoke there after a failed quit in January didnt want to admit defeat to them and it fixed the urge pronto.

Didnt even tell me he was quitting. He never nagged me either and I respected his boundaries after he quit. You cant wish or nag someone into quitting smoking and the addiction is so insidious that it makes it difficult to take that leap. I really think making the decision to quit is the hardest bit. And the really bad part is that you cannot tell a smoker how GOOD it is not to smoke. I feel sorry for them now I really do. Life is so much better without smoking.

For instance when I was a smoker I would go out to bars or parties and get wasted as an excuse to chain smoke all night. Now I find Ill only go out if Im actually in the mood to see people or to enjoy a show.

Each time you have a cigarette socially or otherwise you continue to fuel your addiction and that is why you saw yourself increase the number of cigarettes you have been smoking.  As long as you keep smoking you will always want to smoke  that is how the drug works.  So what you need to do is mentally prepare yourself to never have another cigarette again...ever...not even socially.  Good luck.

I think you are being encouraging right now and that is really awesome but I think that addiction is also just addiction.  years on nicotine is still hell to be rid of and it doesnt feel any easier by thinking it might be worse if one had been on nicotine for  years. I mean Im at the decade mark myself for nicotine addiction so I dont remember what it might have been like to quit before  years but it doesnt seem right to me to think that anyone in this sub has it easier than anyone else. Of course I wish it could be easier for some people but I think that has more to do with the individual than with time. I absolutely agree with your general sentiment though.

I am a  year old woman who cried because her parents were going out of town. At the same time Im so scared my boyfriend of almost a year will throw his hands up and say he cant deal with me anymore.

Why is someone who hasnt smoked in a really long time any different?Youre telling me that if I quit for a year then smoke one cigarette I will experience withdrawal symptoms and go back to smoking again? Im sorry but I just dont believe that. Withdrawal happens because your body is not producing enough dopamine. But when you quit your dopamine production eventually goes back to its normal levels.

We lose a lot of people in the first two weeks with and without nicotine.I cant say I went through it exactly your way.  But before my quit I did a little test.  I have a pill that if you take it you will never smoke again.  No sideffects.  Just that.  How do you feel?  Pause for a second to think what your answer would have been.  My answer was fear.  I was scared of a couple of things that I figured out.  One of them was the loss of something constant in my life that I thought gave me pleasure and thought comforted me.I had to figure out that puzzle to get my current verysticky quit.  You do too.I self brainwashed myself back to something close to normal.  I very seldom have cravings.  I can drink with smokers and have not touched one.  I dont feel sad about smoking stuff ever.  I have a little bit of nostalgia but nostalgia is pretending the good old days were better than they were.  You are accomplishing something that you have probably wanted for years.

The anti ecig studies I have not been impressed with.  They generate a headline saying chemical X is found but with no discussion of partspermillion vs other things.The pro ecig studies are usually analysis of selfreported behaviors or studies of studies with small group size.  Controlled random assignment studies Its heads you keep smoking! would be nice.  Existing longitudinal studies might be adding ecig questions then we would wait for five and ten year stats. My personal opinion like others is vapes are much much safer than smoking and more dangerous than not using.

After I found out it wasnt a heart attack I wanted to do something about it. I lie on the floor with my butt against the wall and my legs straight up resting on the wall. This is a relaxation pose and also makes it so the heart doesnt have to work as hard. I breath deep breaths and rub my chest lightly and think about whats happening to me in a logical clinical fashion. The last one lasted for less than  min. Im really hoping thats all over with now.

3464328,0,t3_2zwjev,I had to deal with the same problem and this is how I conceptualized and executed it nicotine consumption forced my neurons to release unhealthy amounts of dopamine and that artificially stimulated my brains reward system on a regular basis. Stopping that nicotine consumption resulted in lower levels of dopamine which equaled worse stimulation of my reward system which in turns lead to lowered drive and motivation. Breaking this vicious cycle required me to find other ways to supply the reward system with dopamine infusions which turned out to be doing things and accomplishing goals. Realization of the fact that every finished task would be filling that void of stimulating the reward system helped me a lot with my motivation. I forced it on myself like a medicine by doing things mechanically first but now my drive has come back and it is even stronger than at the time when I smoked!  ,stopsmoking,cpn5pb2,2,t5_2rbuf

3488498,0,t3_306grf,The one thing that kept me going through all those nic fits come to think of it was this one line from Allen Carrs book. It was about... how... when we scrape our knee and theres a scab and it hurtsitches we let it heal right? We dont rip off the scab to avoid the hurty itchy part. Thats what the addiction the nicotine fits are the cravinghabits sometimes I think the habit is worse than the physical addiction cause your whole life changes ... for the better but it does change... So smoking another cigarette or falling off the wagon is essentially like ripping off the scab. Youre creating the wound of addiction AGAIN. When instead we just need to let our bodies heal.So we just try to get through those little cravingsfits one at a time. Thats the best way.

I had a good idea that I was going to do it but I just went with the inspiration to stop on a Saturday morning of a long weekend. Sounds great right? Well I forgot to take into account I was starting my period that week.You know what? The cravings were not uncontrollable. I may have felt some symptoms a little more intensely but it was all temporary. The cravings would come in waves that would subside. I knew if I was able to make it  days the worst of it would be over and it was.Having primed my brain with Easy Way I was as ready as I would ever be so I went with it and I was right. Temporary discomfort for so many benefits gained.Go to things in the first days ice water lots of ice water! Yoga breathing exercises. Food wise lots of crunchy veggies to munch on but I was also a little kind with myself and allowed a few indulgences that first week especially.

It doesnt cure the disease but nicotine makes it possible for him to lead a normal life.

In my experience... I too have done it quite a lot of times.. and everytime I got back to smoking after a spell of quitting i just had to face off from them for a couple of weeks and could manage through later .... I started to believe now that more than anyone else there is only one person who is watching me whether I m keeping up the word whether I m cheating or being honest on what I wanted to do... no guessing required its me.... myself... I realized over time that I need to stop cheating to myself... if I know its hurting me.. and I m not willing to go back to smoking.. then I have to be honest to myself... I have no reasons to tell myself why I want to smoke that one extra cig. I m just about  days after I have quit. But as long as I do not cheat to myself I have started to believe that I can do it... Just try it out.. talk to yourself as a second person and tell that guy inside you that you are not going to cheat and let him watch you for the rest of the life.... hope it works... for me and for you too...  ... good luck.

Like having to plan cigarette breaks into every activity you did smoking cigarettes you didnt want or need just because you thought you might not get a chance to for a while and it still didnt help coughing so hard you see stars that esophagus feeling... I could go on but Im sure you have your own list.  Those moments were nice but they were not worth all of the shittiness that came with them.

Theres no such thing as just one cigarette or a cigarette every now and then because once that nicotine enters your system its gonna make sure to remind you about it.Stop smoking. The withdrawal symptoms are very minor. Most of it is mental because youre telling yourself I want a cigarette but I cant have one Remember that cigs dont provide relief. They just satisfy your nicotine craving. That craving will go away in  days if you dont touch another cig. ,stopsmoking,crgjz5z,3,t5_2rbuf

You already let yourself miss smoking in a social setting. How are you going to not smoke if thats already a factor and you have not even trained new behavior in such circumstances. Its hard for a while and then you change. You will stop hanging out with the same people probably but it will be worth your lungs.Edit Btw.

That meansJust have breakfast no cigarette.Hold a phone conversation no cigarette.Drink your coffee no cigarette.Have a night on the town no cigarette.Wake up in the middle of the night get a glass of water and try to go back to sleep no cigarette.It takes time but youre capable of doing this.

4369965,0,t3_3b2fcc,Congrats on making this decision!In his book This Is How Augusten Burroughs writes that often we may want to do things but the only way they will really happen is when we turn those things into a need.  I found for me when I turned quitting into something much more serious that HAD to happen and not just something that I kind of WANTED to happen my resolve became a lot better and I am much better able to be around smokers now and not give in.  When I am around smokers now I still have the cravings sometimes but my need to not smoke trumps it.  So much of this is just pure psychology.In a more concrete way I would suggest that if you are around people that are smoking keep your hands and mouth busy.  Drink water chew gum have candy.  A few people on here I saw suggested sunflower seeds.  You cant avoid smokers forever so figure out whatever way you can to be around them while you are still having cravings and not smoke.One thing Allen Carr suggests is to not feel envious of smokers but realize that they are addicted that they arent actually enjoying that cigarette as much as you think.  Feel sorry for them as they are still slaves to their addiction and proud of yourself for quitting.In terms of alcohol the advice I have and was given to me on here by others is to keep drinking but just do so in moderation.  Have a drink or two at home and dont smoke.  If out limit how many drinks you have.  Stay sober enough to maintain self control.  The idea is that you need to decouple drinking with smoking in your mind.I made a list of reasons for quitting on my phone which I reference when I have a craving if I am out.  I also found the days rolling over on the badge to be a huge motivator to stick to it.  I also normally come on here and readcomment on some posts before I head out to social situations where there will be drinking and smoking.  It helps me keep my resolve and gets the motivation high for the night.Good luck!  You got this!,stopsmoking,csi8aj6,1,t5_2rbuf

4433295,0,t3_3btw8z,Just remember that not smoking is an action and it makes you feel good. Those cravings you have right now theyre gonna be there WAY more often and WAY worse if you keep smoking. Youre at  days. You know how amazing that is? After  days youre nicotine free! That means you only gotta fight the mental addiction. Every day is another day healthier and feeling better. Wait till the end of the week. Your sense of smell will be amazing. You wont even believe how crazy it is to smell the outdoors. Itll feel like a drug. Your body can handle this! Its meant to be without cigarettes. Having a craving doesnt mean you have to smoke. Dont feel bad for having them. Theyre perfectly normal but that doesnt mean a smoke will actually make you feel better especially in the long run.Im telling you every week shit...every day that goes by you feel better than the last. After about a month you wont believe how different youll feel. If you really wanna go back to the shitty existence of a smoker after a month thats your choice but Im telling you you wont want to. People smoke because they think it makes them feel better. Notsmoking makes you feel better. If you smoke youll realize that it didnt satisfy you. They never do! You always feel like you want more or you wish you never had one. The only way to actually feel normal again is to stop smoking. Its possible. Say hello to energy the ability to run the ability to smell a sense of selfrespect less headaches less and eventually no cravings and less misery.Join the club and welcome back to life. ,stopsmoking,cspi6jr,4,t5_2rbuf
4452281,0,t3_3c1ope,I too am in this situation basically. I have for the past week tried out one nicotine and tobacco free snus variant called Qvitt if youre used to having the pouch that might be a good thing to try out.  I did try out nicotine gum for a while which was a bit weird to me. Because when you start to chew on that one the nicotine will be released. But that might just be that I used a quite strong nicotine gum though. I do think that you may be able to use nicotine gum as much as you want but I also think that you might feel a bit ill considering the nicotine and how much of it you get   I was thinking that a combination of ordinary gum and nicotine cum may be a good thing to try out sometime I think Ill do that at least.,stopsmoking,csrw7k1,1,t5_2rbuf

I have had such an easy time quitting thanks to his method and all I can do is hope that I can set an example for my SO. That he can see how I wasnt giving up anything by quitting but that I have had so much to gain. It breaks my heart to see smokers now because I know theyre caught in a terrible cycle of addiction to nicotine. All I can suggest is to set an example.

4914793,0,t3_3i7cak,I started smoking when I was twelve. Now at  I am happy to say I am  days cigarette free. Imagine how you feel on the computer its fun millions of bits of information at your fingertips you feel powerful behind a screen you know? So then you get offline. Imagine you dont use your phone or computer or any technology. If youre used to using that technology life gets dull without it and you just want to use it more. Does that kind of explain it? You just sort of have this impulse to keep coming back because it feels nice?I mean maybe its just the thought of it that feels nice. The physical effects certainly suck. At  I could barely breath at night just lying in bed trying to sleep. It literally kept me up at night because I had abused my lungs for so long. Anyway thats my answer to your first question of How addicting is smoking?How can people break this addiction? is sort of a hard question because what works for some people wont work for others. Honestly I quit because I got really sick one day. I was in the hospital for a few days I had an upper respiratory infection pneumonia and bronchitis. Obviously smoking made it worse. So I couldnt smoke until I got better. That sucked but I didnt end up getting better for about  weeks. At that point I figured Im past the hard part and just kept going without cigarettes. I still get cravings from time to time but they arent nearly as bad as they used to be. But thats just my story. Some people use nicotine gum patches or medication. Others somehow have successfully quit cold turkey. The main thing about quitting is you have to WANT to quit.Hope that clears some stuff up for you.,stopsmoking,cue1pcp,2,t5_2rbuf

You are trying to put out a fire by pouring gasoline on it.When you have been a smoker there is never a point in your life where you are no longer a smoker you are simply a smoker who is not currently smoking. The urge to smoke will be there for years maybe forever. I quit smoking for more than a year and one day got stressed out and went and bought a pack and that was that I was smoking again. It was barely even a conscious decision to get the smokes just a reaction. Or maybe it would be better to say that I had my guard down and was unable to actively combat my self conscious urge to smoke.EDITBe supportive but not demanding about it.

Diacetyl is the same chemical that has caused irreversible lung diseases in popcorn factory workers and now some coffee factory workers.Really shows the juvenility of the vape company reps and the utter lack of regulation for these presently harmful products.mm of vape juiceday will keep users in the clear of recommended commercial limits of diacetyl ingestion and irreversible lung damage...but users average between mm of vape juiceday.I also didnt know that nicotine is linked to cardiovascular disease.

I wish I had been as wise as you back then!Honestly though I dont mean to serve you that when I was your age bullcrap but theres one thing I need to say and youre free to do what you want with it.Do not hesitate in telling your family and asking for their help. If you can quit on your own and manage yourself keeping it a secret might just work but if its going to drive you crazy and potentially have you say or do things you normally wouldnt go ahead and talk with your parents an older brother or a sister someone you feel you can trust. I know how hard it can be to upfront tell our parents weve been doing stupid things like that but in the long run its much more stupid to hide it and keep doing it. From someone who told his own mother about a cocaine addiction among other things I know for a fact that being honest with my parents and close friends was an important step in being honest with myself about all this. And that greatly helped getting rid of all that junk.tldr? Keep it up it gets better every day!

Unless you are adamant that you know you can drink become a little intoxicated and refrain from temptation dont risk it.  Start small by having a few after work drinks or a few at home work your way up to consuming alcohol and being in the presence of smokers and consciously become aware of how often they are coming and going to top up their body with the filfthy toxic chemical cocktail and how much they stink when they come back. It truly does stink because its poison and toxic.

Once you have reduced to a single cigarette a day that single ciggarete will be the only thing you can think about the entire day. It will drive you crazy. The only way to quit is convincing yourself that you are actually done with smoking and you do not want to do it anymore not even once because you know that will only result in relapsing.

6323232,0,t3_427sxc,One tip from me is I always gave up after I couldnt resist the morning cigarette  and would try again a different day.   This time I quit midday on a Friday  and have been and feel I will be successful long term now.   The biggest thing is your mindset and wanting to personally quit for you  and you seem to be ready!  The first  or  days were the strongest cravings for me  and slowed down and died down slowly from there.  After the first few weeks each cravings being beat felt to reaffirm my quit and make me feel stronger.  Coming  here looking at a app  talking to other non quitters about quitting  helped me keep my resolve early on.  Also listened to Allen carrs easy way to quit  on you tube over the first week which also seemed to help give me something to do  during a strong craving. Goodluck!  You got this! ,stopsmoking,cz8drxl,5,t5_2rbuf

I smoked in the dream and it was GREAT.  I could feel the smoke hit my lungs and I could feel that nicotine hit my neurons.  Amazing.I woke up and I was super relieved that it was just a dream.  It was also kind of fun to be honest.  I was like I got to cheat without cheating.  Dont feel guilty dude.  Dreams arent real.     ,stopsmoking,czcnqpn,3,t5_2rbuf

6371502,0,t3_42wnte,gt If anyone has an input on my plan or can share their own stories thatll be awesome!!My first hand experience is with ecigs but I talk to many patch and gum users.  It sometimes takes one nicotine level to get the first days without smoking.  Then you dont need as much.  So if the buzz continues try a mg patch.  Imporant here you are dialing in a nicotine level that lets you go about your day without too much struggle.My advice is not to battle with putting the patches on later and later until you have a month without smoking.  With my ecig quitting group everyone had a mood change around  weeks where we knew we would never smoke again.  Quitting nicotine was easy then.Any way you do it is fine of course.,stopsmoking,czdvbcl,1,t5_2rbuf

I remember I had a meeting at my daughters school we were sitting in the headmistress office when she said she could smell burning and was looking for signs of fire.

Weve been taught brainwashed for years to believe that smoking was cool relaxing that it enhanced our image and social capabilities that it was a crutch when shit was going bad or a reward when shit was going good. Of course its too easy to miss something like that. We need to understand what they have done to us and break free from the chains and see the lie for what it is greedy tobacco companies using a highly addictive substance to hook us in and sell us poison even if it kills us.

I was sure that quitting will suck because I was enjoying smoking quite a lot before i quit.But... Its actually bullshit the thing is that if you have something to do pretty much any activity that would make smoking getting in a way you dont have to smoke and certainly not even think about it.Eat something perhaps preferably healthy when youre sitting and doing nothing and do something when youre not sitting. And dont torture yourself by thinking about smoking do something instead whatever knit something masturbate pick up a guitar get a falcon D.Because since I quit I cant just relax and do nothing. Which I guess might not be that bad.Anyway youre not missing out on anything we dont have to analyze that just remind yourself that voluntarily inhaling carcinogenic particles is just retarded.,stopsmoking,d17mwt7,1,t5_2rbuf

7170992,0,t3_4dokf5,Those desires you have are old stress triggers. And youve not retrained parts of your brain from want to disgust. Contrast to this  there are wonderful aromatic smells in tobacco use particularly pipe and a few variations of cigar. But these smells entice me to want to smoke in the same way that Id want to smoke a wood log  it only smells nice from a distance. And in places of heavy smoking it makes me feel ill. Unfortunately I live with smokers. and at times that shit pisses me off because they dont understand that it makes me feel ill.  But at the same time its taught me to deal with it from every angle to not get rehooked within its grasp. My proposition here I guess is for you to figure out what is still pulling you in. Its very likely a mental aspect youve been ignoring. Its time to move on from Not thinking about cigarettes to not caring if you do .Its clearly a part of our past and we shouldnt deny that.

Your body has not slowly gotten used to less and less nicotine. Thats not how it works.Its great you were able to quit this way and everyone quits in their own way. But I believe you were able to quit DESPITE this method not because of it.If anyone is reading this post thinking they might try this method you have two options keep yourself in chronic withdrawal for several weeks by limiting the number of cigarettes you can have each day AND THEN after all of that smoke your last cigarette and go through  hours of nicotine withdrawal. OR... you can smoke your last cigarette right away and go through  hours of withdrawal. I guarantee you those  hours of nicotine withdrawal will be equally as difficult no matter what option you choose. So why go through several weeks of hell before that?,stopsmoking,d38v0hc,2,t5_2rbuf

Basically a quit is is the longer you can go without one but nicotine the little monster that it is reminds you that you shouldnt. The video goes on to point out that you might think that a cigarette relieves stress but in actuality its causes it.  ampnbspOf course I didnt believe it at the time amp I primarily quit because I wanted to be healthier avoid cancer have life insurance etc. Fast forward  or something days to where I am today and I find that I am a less stressful person. I dont feel like I have the anxiety that I used too. ampnbspAnyways Ive tried alot of things patches gum vaping etc. And I really think going coldturkey is the best way.

7927803,0,t3_4ntbvf,What I did was just go to two local shops that have vapes look at their selection and ask lots of questions. The guy in the second shop was super helpful and even gave me a discount to ensure that Id be a returning customer. Here are a few things I learned that might help you. Vapes and ecigs are the same thing but vapes are way more satisfying.. There are two types topcoil and bottomcoil vapes. The difference is whether the coil Coil is the part that gets hot and vaporizes the juice is on top of or below the tank Tank is just the chamber that holds the juice. I would highly recommend a bottomcoil for various reasons.. Buy a second battery. Its so worth it. You wont have to worry about having a dead battery and wanting nicotine.. Start out with .mg nicotine content then after a couple weeks scale it back to .mg or zero. You wont even notice that youre not getting nicotine anymore. I dont crave nicotine at all.. Get a couple different flavors to start out. Dont get tobacco flavored juice because its not going to taste like a cigarette. But furthermore it reinforces the fallacy that vaping is a substitute for cigs when in reality youre upgrading to something better. Flavors and aromas are part of the fun of vaping fuck tobacco.. Dont get too caught up on the specs. Unless youre trying to win some vape competitions or something you just need a standard setup. Two batteries a bottomcoil tank and a couple flavors of .mg juice.Sorry this got so long but these are some tips that I found helpful when I started out! Vaping has worked wonders for me over the last few months and I havent bought a single pack of cigs. Ive even saved money. Good luck!,stopsmoking,d475rbc,2,t5_2rbuf

I bought one copy to my father and he keeps reading only one page everyday and the look of fear in his face when I tell him he needs to stop really breaks my heart.

You know perfectly well why you stopped and the only reason you will crave another cigarette is the nicotine trap inside your brain demanding more and more.

8430082,0,t3_4v31k9,Woohoo a question I can answer!I would recommend looking at other NRTs as your main supplement to ween yourself off cigs. I did that. I used mg nicotine gum followed the guidelines and vaped in between the  hours between my next gum piece as a placebo for that smoking sensation I missed. My juice originally was the recommended strength over vaping friends gave me but I slowly diluted it.The important thing to conquer is what youll be doing not smoking and your true internal motivation to quit. Obviously some people dont like NRTs or vaping and think its the easy way out it kinda is but its a great tool if you dont use it as a replacement for cigarettes. Use it as a tool to quit smoking completely. Have a start date and an end date for your NRTvape. The important part is to have a plan to quit. Stick to it and dont look back.  Thats really what it comes down to.. you can do the same thing going cold turkey but if this is what will motivate you to quit smoking then do it.For what its worth its been  months since my last cigarette and I havent cracked yet. I stopped vaping . months in when I got bored of it. I had some mood swings but I think my physical symptoms were much less difficult than what others have experienced. I had full intent when I started vaping to quit that as well and I felt like a big phony for awhile but I think it can help if cold turkey hasnt worked. shrug I think the biggest key to quitting for good is to address the reason why you smoke. If youre upset really ask yourself if a cigarette is going to change the situation at all? How much power does this cigarette have over you? Why does it have power in the first place? Why do you value smoking over other activities? What can you do to replace the time you spend smoking? etc etcThe social support here is also necessary to quitting IMO.Psst OP why havent you started your ticker yet?,stopsmoking,d5vaupz,2,t5_2rbuf

Let me tell you the step down to mg is the actual quitting.   is easy  gave me a bit of withdrawal . a little more and then I went to mg and everything else immediately seemed like nothing at all.  Wait until you hit mg before you get any false sense of anything because I can tell you from experience that it is easy because you are still feeding your nicotine addiction.

8677409,0,t3_4yq1x7,Ive had a lot of quit attempts like we all have and tried this approach about ten years ago. It was a miserable experience and needless to say it didnt work.If youve lurked this sub some then youve seen Allen Carrs name come up. He debunks this approach some and I think youd find it interesting. Think of it this way  the only reason we smoked each cigarette was to relieve the withdrawal symptoms we were experiencing from the previous smoke. It takes the suffering away temporarily but within an hour or so were already feeling the itch again. Testing how long you can go without a smoke is just extending the suffering of those withdrawal periods and each time you light up youre back to square one. Its like peeling a bandaid off slowly a bandaid that never ends. Moment of truth is this method going to work for you meaning can you go from  to  to eventually zero and stick with it? If yes stop reading my comment and tell me to piss off. If no... and this sounds terrible but... go back to smoking like you usually would. Seriously do but heres the catch  you have to consciously hate every cigarette you smoke. Start a journal about why you hate smoking. What does it rob from you? What would you gain from quitting? Get a game plan together. Get yourself ready mentally for a quit. Check out Allen Carrs book download some quit apps maybe see what resources are available through your health insurance provider whatever you think will work for you. Quitting should be something you look forward to. Sure youll still have some withdrawal symptoms and even the occasional moments of triggered anger but it goes away. It gets easier. You can do it. You want to do it. Now go all in.,stopsmoking,d6qasu2,2,t5_2rbuf

When I do smoke I can go through a half to a full pack depending on the circumstances.  Like at a casino or around a bonfire.  I just reached  weeks of non smoking and I notice I feel so much better in the mornings.  Even though I wasnt an everyday smoker I still smelled when I did smoke.  Once you quit you notice how much the others smell like smoke when they go outside.I dont go outside any longer to smoke so I dont miss out on times with with friends and family.  However I will admit there is a flip side to that since I do miss out on the social side of going outside with the other smokers.  Plus my family and friends are proud of me.  Each time I have tried to quit I disappoint my kids when I go back to smoking.  So far so good this time.  Most of all its the pride that I have in myself with each day that tests my resolve.

But instead of going to the balcony to smoke a cig I was vaping on my couch whioe watching movies playing video games etc. I think I was vaping more than I had originally been smoking. After about  months of vaping my gums were beginning to bleed an alarming amount. Not just the usual from flossing. I didnt even have to brush my teeth to start it. Just taking a bite out of bread I would see blood on the bread it was scary. I typically brush my teeth twice a day and use mouthwash before bed after brushing and flossing. I had never seen my mouth act like this. So after roughly  months of vaping I was terrified threw out my vape and started smoking half a pack of cigs per day again.
