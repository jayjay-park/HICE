8495993,0,t1_d63g5sh,I never tried for a working visa but maybe. Every country has different visa laws so it probably depends. It could be a very good way to build connections. My site in Egypt was just getting off the ground and said they wanted to bring me back on as paid help later once they were more established.Since the Egypt tourist visa is  days and I stayed six months I did get an extension on mine but it wasnt for work.,workaway,d63jtj5,2,t5_2yhfr
