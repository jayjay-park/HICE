1996750,0,t3_2hj963,The relationship between the armature and mesh seems odd at first but makes sense as your scenes grow in complexity.  If you move the mesh the armature wont move. The armature will still affect the mesh in pose mode albeit with larger movements because the pivot points are different.  On the upside this allows you to create more complicated models because you can use an armature as a sort of scaffolding or puppeteer to control the model from outside the mesh.  However drivers are often more convenient than an outer scaffolding nowadays. The origin point behavior is correct because in most cases youll be linking or appending your characters into other scenes so youll want the pivot point to remain consistent.  Typically artists place the origin at the point where the character meets the floor.  ,blenderhelp,cktt4ep,2,t5_2t9eb

3679455,0,t3_32j2xs,Hi thereI seemed to have made a pretty stupid mistake when making my model. Its causing me some headaches when trying to rig and if possible Im wondering if you can help me with some advice on how to best adjust it without completely destroying my mesh?As shown in the image I want to have a sort of off T pose to match up bettter with the rigify rig. Also having my hands out is causing issues with rotation when I want to bring my hands together.Im thinking the best way would be to delete the faces at my shoulder and detach each arm. Then rotate each arm and reattach it back to the shoulder? Can you see any easier way to rotate this without completely deforming my mesh in the shoulder areas?Thanks!,blenderhelp,cqbokd3,2,t5_2t9eb

3987928,0,t3_365b17,These are normal bones. To be more precise they are both armatures renamed to rig and pose.An armature is a collection of bones.They are split it because rig is what youll want to key add key frames for by hitting I so their position is saved and export to a game. And pose are helper bones that youll move around to help you more easily pose your figure they have various constraints that communicate between the two armatures to make it easier for you.EDITThe Rig is a set of bones it brings you into edit mode. Pose is pose data not sure what that data is but it brings you into pose mode. Animation is animation data.They look like sticks because in the armature tab under display it is set to stick by default it is octahedral. These are just different ways to visualize bones in blender and have no impact on exporting.

At work I use a pc with a single core .ghz cpu and  gb ram and two mb vidcards. Needless to say Ive never seen my render ratio come above fps. Also Id recommend either buying or pirating a copy of Sony Vegas Pro or similar software. Blender does get the job done if you want it to look like an yr old did the job.

Another option might be to just move the tips of slys hair in a bit. You can select the tips and press alto to enable connected proportional editing.

8174795,0,t1_d4zcpg8,You can unwrap with modifiers on they will simply stack on eachother due to the mirror modifier unless you check the U and V options U will mirror along the xaxis imagine a vertical line down the middle of the UVmap. And V will mirror along the yaxis imagine a horizontal line down the middle of the UVmap. Unwrapping with modifiers on can be very helpful for example you could use an array modifier for a fence and only unwrap one section of the fence.The downside is if you use something like the subdivide surface modifier it can become hard to deal with stretching because you have less vertices to work with when placing your UV islands. gtselecting interior faces is not easy.You can press the eye icon on the modifier to temporarily disable it letting you see only half of the model. Then in face select mode hold alt to select the loop created from the extrusion..Another common tactic is to hide faces with H. When you do it also augments linked faces. So if you say hide the faces around the edge you can then select the interior by selecting on face then pressing ctrlL to select all faces linked to it and delete them.Just note if youve already unwrapped ctrlL will select the island not just linked faces Hiding faces is also a generally good way of getting to faces that are hard to reach. Along with numpad .Del which will zoom in on your selection.,blenderhelp,d4zedmz,1,t5_2t9eb

9407938,0,t3_59hnb2,A texture is imagemovie data which can import  or some mathematical operation that generates an image. like cloud or noise texturesA Material is a container which can hold many different textures mixed together in various ways.A Mesh data tab can map different materials to different faces.An object can contain one Mesh data tab.So one object can contain one mesh. That mesh can have many materials and each material can have many textures.I think at one point you could directly link a texture to an object without a material but that may of been deprecated.Textures can also be used by different parts of blender like a brush or a mask when painting. So they exist on their own to be used in different parts of blender which is why you can see brush   world and material sections on the texture tab to allocate a texture to different parts of blender.Was that simple enough for ELI?,blenderhelp,d98it42,5,t5_2t9eb

Depending on your video card or computer this will take a long time.  Usually a  second clip takes about  days or so.  If you want a fast simple render without fancy light you can switch it back to Blender render instead of cycles but the lighting textures and details wont be as good.  This picture in K took about  hours to render on a GTX .  Just imagine  hours per frame at  frames per second at  seconds.  It would take  hours to render days.

Are there any slots for vector or UVs in the lux renderer you can populate with a UV map? Could it be possible that lux render only accepts a single UV map per object and you may have multiple UV maps? Did this work in your simple test scene? Dose lux render only accept specific kinds of textures?
