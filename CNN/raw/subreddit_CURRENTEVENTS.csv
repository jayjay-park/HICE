2700674,0,t1_cnb1xzc,There were multiple stories to the brown case. And resisting arrest is grounds for killing someone .o what world do you live in? The guy was selling cigarettes and hes dead now. In north Carolina a black guy got into a car accident and was seeking help a man reported him as trying to break in a police officer shot  times and hit  times. Theres an additional thing called use of excessive force.... Also you do know the brown kid was left on the street for  hours? And the cop hit shot him  times? What kind of idiot cop would do that? If it was not intentional then he is clearly not capable of handling a weapon,CURRENTEVENTS,cnb21g5,2,t5_2r9j8
