292871,0,t3_1xf06o,When I started I really wanted a book that broke it down as far as it could go like this plant takes this space and will produce this amount under good circumstances.  I never found that book but Square Foot Gardening was a decent start.  It gave me the order I wanted in the beginning when I didnt know plant sizes yields etc.  Another book Ive found useful is Eliot Colemans Four Season Harvest which shows methods for growing outside of normal seasons.As far as holding down a hr job goes I dont know where you are but if youre able to go out there even only  min a day to check on things have reasonable expectations about success and failure and if the garden isnt too big sq ft you can do it spend a couple hours on the weekend.

1984729,0,t3_2hg2qs,Where are you located? What type of land do you have ie mostly forested pasture a mix of both? I really like The New Self Sufficient Gardener by John Seymour for ideas on homestead and garden layout. The Resilient Farm and Homestead by Ben Falk is a worthwhile book for any location but is most useful for those in the eastern deciduous forest region. The recently published Forest Farming book by Ken Mudge and Steve Gabriel is excellent if you have a significant wood lot. Or if youre in the more oaksavannah region Midwest and west Restoration Agriculture by Mark Shephard is a good place to start. Sepp Holzers Permaculture is a terrific and inspiring read for anyone.Planting guides will depend on where you live..

8979208,0,t3_537fhw,Ill be in a similar boat as you when I actually get some land.Im going to just dive right in and let logic and experience take me through my mistakes. With things like Reddit and other internet resources at ones disposal its easier to avoid Noob mistakes but plenty of mistakes will still be made.First thing Im going to do is make sure I can create and maintain my soil. This is going to require animals of some sort because manurecompost but having that foundation goes right into...Fruits and Nuts  Since a lot of fruits need time to establish once the soil web is functional and sufficient Ill plant fruit and nut trees and every other local fruit I can from blueberries to paw paw to grapes and strawberries. Blueberries will be able to be planted because my soil plan will have taken into account different garden areas of varying pH to accomodate different plants and help get the best harvest possible. I also plan to espalier the fruit trees to make harvesting easier. I plan to line the outer perimeter of my land with espalier fruit trees. The very next thing will be for me to plant as many varieties of perennial food crops that I can get my hands on and in my soil. Asparagus the aforementioned strawberries there is a big list for my Zone.From there I can branch out in several directions but Ill most likely dabble in aquaponics and all homegrown fish food so I can have some fresh salad in the wintertime.Eventually Id like to regularly raise a pig have miniature breed dairy cow on the land chickens the occasional turkey and small grain patches.I think the most important thing is to have a vision then do your best to do work that directly makes that vision a reality. Youre going to make mistakes learn how to learn from your mistakes or your romanticized dream of selfsufficiency will become a nightmare.Nothing is ever completely like we expect it to be. Sometimes its even better than we hoped for...its the sometimes not times that cause the problems.I think starting slowly and steadily but slowly building speed is the way to go. You gotta get into a rhythm and stay flexible. Your animals fencing illness both man and beast weather and a ton of other things are going to change what you actually do that day regardless of what you planned to do.If youre going to vegetable garden pick your method now get your seed order together and ready to pull the trigger and get whatever else you need from seed starting equipment to a high tunnel whatever your chosen method calls for and be ready to make it all happen when the time comes. There is too much gardening advice out there and it can be overwhelming as well as conflicting. Just look up five different sites for the preferred soil pH for Plant X. Its crazy. I think a combination of the county extension agency and trial and errorexperience is the best way to go.READ READ READ.
