75154,0,t1_cemzene,Yeah.  If i were to lower it i would only lower the rear end just so it sits level.  And I personally dont want a turbo on it.  It pulls strong on the high end but could really use some more grunt down low.  Im thinking of doing the Jackson racing supercharger if i can find one.  Or maybe the Vortec.  I just need to get a new set of the  spoke svt rims.  The previous owner lightly curbed the ones that are on it a bit.  I love those rims.,Hatchback,cemzh9l,1,t5_2xg59
