667427,0,t3_21s6r2,Things my school values in our paras flexible e.g. if you have to work with a different student at the last minute quick learners I only want to have to explain things once maybe twice committed show up on time dont use all of your sick days every year pleasant to work withBonuses able to collect data well can deescalate kids in crisis restraint trained have a basic knowledge of how to teach the level of student you are working with familiar with curriculumHope this helps! I would emphasize any of the above things that apply to you plus any experience you have. Good luck!  Dont underestimate the value of being pleasant to work with and easy to teach even if you dont have a lot of experience. Those are probably two of the most desirable traits in a para or any employee in my opinion.,specialed,cgg4w7z,3,t5_2vum5

1560014,0,t3_2c3h1y,I taught special education this past year under a temporary license since I was enrolled in a graduate program for special education for five years prior I had taught high school math and science. I also had the experience where I loved coteaching. What I found was that there were responsibilities with special education that I hadnt considered such as billing for Medicaid completing progress reports and gathering data for and writing behavior plans. Additionally I was only teaching resource room classes so I didnt get the opportunity to coteach. Although I taught less students compared to general ed I feel like my work load was about the same due to my responsibilities as an advocatecasemanager. In my schoolstate special education teachers can be usually placed in any area of need regardless of their specific certification except for special cases where a certification is designated on a students IEP e.g. we have a room for students with severe cognitive impairments that is staffed by a teacher with a specific cognitive impairment certification. One other thing to consider is the cost of making the switch. In Michigan to switch from general education to special education requires getting postgraduate certification which is essentially a Masters degree  credits. Additionally as a secondary certified teacher I would have to take classes not only for special education but for elementary certification since the special ed certificate is K. I decided not to pursue it after this past year because it would end up costing me about  in tuition and I just finished a different graduate degree.A lot of this really depends on your state since requirements and certifications vary between states. In Michigan for example there are nine different teacher certifications you can get to teach special education typically each one requires the completion of a separate planned program the certifications in Michigan include Emotional Impairments Learning Disabilities Cognitive Impairments Speech amp Language Impairments PhysicalOH Impairments Visually Impairments Hearing Impairments Autism PE for students with disabilities. Other states have only two or three different types of certification.Not to scare you away if teaching special education is what you want to do but if its just that you like coteaching a better solution might be to let your administration and the special ed department know your preference. If you really like working with students who have special needs then I think getting certified in special ed is a good option.,specialed,cjbtka3,2,t5_2vum5

5539570,0,t1_cwgtaj3,I am going to refer to some of my notes from college but I dont have the citations. gt Early intervention focuses on helping eligible babies and toddlers learn the basic and brandnew skills that typically develop during the first three years of life such asphysical reaching rolling crawling and walkingcognitive thinking learning solving problemscommunication talking listening understandingsocialemotional playing feeling secure and happy andselfhelp eating dressing. ltEarly intervention programs need to target low income families single parent teen mothers low education parents etc. Head start programs boys and girls club for toddlers teachers that go to homes perhaps. These programs may cost money but I believe the various research stated that it is cheaper to prevent early then to react later.I am unsure about policies and mandate pertaining to Spanish as a first language. I just feel that they are overly identified as special education. They dont always have disorders. They simply do not understand the language of the lessons. I suppose a policy would address that kind of over identification.,specialed,cwjq8m3,1,t5_2vum5
5947297,0,t3_3wukx8,How do youwhat experience do you have collaborating with other teachers support staff and service providers ot pt speech. Preach collaboration. Classrooms with severely disabled children have a LOT of adults in the room  the special ed teacher the TA a handful of aides behavior specialists and push in service providers. I got asked how I would manage when the classroom becomes overwhelming or when issues arise between staff members and myself. How would you support students who are struggling in a specific area? They might give you a scenario and ask you how you would respond.Might get asked about communication with parents  especially if its a small district. Definitely be prepared for a behavioral management andor classroom management question with this population of students.What experience do you have with differentiated instruction? Give an example of a time when you differentiated for the students.And of course the dreaded tell me about yourself.,specialed,cxz7yks,1,t5_2vum5

9370246,0,t3_58qt1j,Communication with the teachers should be number one priority. Make sure you understand the material and expectations to ensure successful transitions. Also as mentioned by Sophie dont hover over the kiddos and ensure you are providing support to other kiddos as well to ensure they are not singled out. Definitely step out for testing and plan ahead for that if necessary. Always be a few steps ahead like getting note topics ahead of time to make arrangements for your students whether that means fill in the blank notes or just a copy of slides etc. ,specialed,d93qudn,1,t5_2vum5

9997722,0,t3_5io54g,I am in my first year of teaching on an emergency license while I finish up year  of a parttime licensure program. Before I applied to my program I spent a year volunteering in sped classrooms. I was lucky enough to have Fridays off at my job so I spent those days making sure that my decision to go back to school was the right one. I loved it and I got to know the teachers and ask questions about the job. When I started volunteering it felt like it would be forever before I had a classroom of my own. Now I have a classroom and I feel after a decade in healthcare prior like I fit right in as a sped teacher. I love my job and Im so happy to be where I am now. Good luck! Check the prerequisite classes too... I had to take math psychology and a class about exceptional learners in that year of prep. ,specialed,dbaqcsp,2,t5_2vum5
