6741885,0,t1_d0bsktn,Id love to get a couple of NASCAR slot cars. Would love a black  and some of those cool classic NASCAR racers but theyre impossible to find over here.  ,slotcars,d0go2wr,1,t5_2t7o4
6951620,0,t3_4axdkl,I have the ferrari set from target from  and the tornado set with loop from last years cataloge a banked turn set and a strait pack.  cars have the magnets removed so they can drift and most others have magnets for when I have the loop installed in the track.  lap counters for small straits  Every piece of track that I have right now is in use besides the loop and  power section. I bid and won a  degree banked turn on ebay so ill be getting that soon and have to try and add it into the layout.  also looking for good deals on craigslist and stuff for  since they dont sell it in the US much anymore,slotcars,d14ar63,2,t5_2t7o4

7453171,0,t1_d2pdi6h,Oh I need to add this depended very much on the car I was dealing with as well. For example this Carrera Audi R weighs . grams whereas the Alfa is rd lighter at . grams. Thats a huge difference. The Audi is virtually impossible to control without magnets and responds almost like a magnetless car when it has its front magnet in strangely enough. But its a massive spinner getting into the corners without the magnets. ,slotcars,d2pdmt3,1,t5_2t7o4
8452132,0,t3_4vew3u,Just to note  this was just done with a bit of spare track on a bit of XPF.I dont want to go full model train detailed but just enough to make the track look a bit nicer.I will add some pictures of the track as it is when I get a chance.,slotcars,d5y1wqk,2,t5_2t7o4
8549840,0,t1_d6a4hxm,Dont mix up Carrera Go and Carrera  Digital.A lot of the themed cars are for Go only but only  Digital can have wireless controllers.Id still suggest Digital . Since it is digital the cars have a dedicated controller instead of a dedicated track. When a car go off track it wouldnt matter on which track the kids would put it back it would work.,slotcars,d6aavy1,5,t5_2t7o4
