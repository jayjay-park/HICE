11109686,0,t1_der8jy9,thats fair. i read it more as dratinietc. is more common a hatch in the k pool than x mon in other pools and therefore is hatching more regularly than those mons not that they were inherently more common drops. but i can definitely see that reading as well. another anecdotal piece just hatched another k and it was a miltank. now im skewing . ,GOmaha,der9ujy,2,t5_3fe47
