The edit of Closer used in the title sequence for Seven  slightly different than the one on the Closer single.     Its hard these days since things arent really as rare as they once were what with torrents and such.   But if you want to go there look for the Tainted Touch Of Trents Caress compilation tapeCD that we made around  or so.  Its got a lot of the remixes he did for Queen Megadeth etc. Lots of great stuff there.    And id add any of the live tracks he did with David Bowie where they contributed to eachothers songs.  NINBowie Scary Monsters Hurt etc were excellent.,nin,cezca80,1,t5_2qhwq

1204505,0,t1_ci53yif,Well said. The first Nine Inch Nails album I listened to was Pretty Hate Machine quickly followed by Year Zero. Afterwards I shifted my focus to With Teeth and really enjoyed it for a while. Only and the HandThat Feeds are two extremely accessible and stupidly enjoyable tracks that are impossible to dislike.

1236929,0,t3_287x7t,Ive never really found myself that much of a fan of most s songs but this song is defiantly an exception. Admittely it was hard for me to get into to begin with not only because of how this song is really reminiscent of the s but just that rain rain go away part. It just sounded sorta weird and out of place but i didnt hate it. Eventually it grew on me and now I actually love this song. I have yet to see NIN live and by god I cannot wait until I do but I probably take up  of my schools internet downloading shows from RITC and I love down in it live especially when trent breaks into the I used to be so big and strong I used to know my right from wrong I used to never be afraid I used to be somebody. Completely random fact here for anyone that may not know  the music video for Down In It actually was thought for  a while to be a snuff film because of that last shot where Trent is lying on the floor. Thats cause they had a low budget therefore to get that shot they attached a balloon to a camera but the camera got away. Some farmer found the footage and well yeah. They did an a news report of it and its funnycheesy as fuck and I highly recommend watching it  ,nin,ci8rrfw,2,t5_2qhwq

1381819,0,t3_29wzbo,This one is actually one of my least favourites on the Fragile. Im not sure why. I love the hell out of the intro and the verses and the build up but... I dunno. The chorus just kills it for me. The drums have this hugeass groove to them like no other. Theres so much space. Then you get to the chorus and its just a solid wall of guitar in the face. Eh. Doesnt really jive too well with me on the arrangement side of things.Honestly though least favourite on the Fragile isnt all too much of a failure the song is still dope as hell. But unfortunately it precedes my absolute favourite song on the album so I find myself getting a little impatient at times.On an album of straight A material Id give it an A.Best NIN album ever by the way.,nin,ciphtye,1,t5_2qhwq

When I went home to Long Island for the summer I went to a really good record store in Oakdale NY which is sadly long gone and asked about NIN and he said its in the industrial section.  Id always assumed that Industrial meant music used in industry like generic music for presentations and such like that. heh.  Ive been a fan ever since.In the mid s after buying up all of the honest releases on CDs I started buying every bootleg CD I could find and ended up starting a website were I reviewed them all so that others could avoid buying the crappy ones.

I think doing daily discussions without discussing the songs would be unrealistic but I can imagine doing weekly maybe even twice a week discussions about topics related to NIN actually when I think about it maybe we could do this every two days or something theres a lot to talk about. From the top of my head. When was the first time you see NIN? What is your favourite live moment? What is your favourite line up? Your favourite vocal performance of Trent? What is your favourite song? What is your favourite album? What is your favourite artwork? What is your favourite interview with Trent? Favourite use of NIN song? What is worst NIN song? What you think future hold for NIN? Do you think Trent made better music when he was on drugs? Your controversial NIN opinions? What would you ask Trent if you had the chance? Favourite NIN lyrics? Your favourite bootleg?  Your favourite tour? Trent from which era do you prefer? Your favourite NIN cover? Disappointing NIN moments?  Dreams about NIN? Favourite NIN remix? Favourite Trent colaboration? What music have you start to listen to because of Trent? Favourite music video? Favourite NIN parody? Who do you like NIN to colab with? What do you think of backup singers on Tension tour? What is your favourite soundtrack work of Trent? Your favourite rare track? What song you wish NIN play live more? Your favourite NIN apparel? Your favourite NIN online community? Why do you think you keep listening to NIN even though you are not angsty teenager anymore? Howwhydid NIN music change your life? Your favourite NIN guitaristbassistdrummer?And I think I could thought out of plenty of more topics. You can check ETS threads for some inspiration or look through some topics discussed on this sub.Im all for discussing some other things not even related that much to NIN. Like  What are you listening to?  What is your favourite movie book etc. Contests are interesting idea we could do contests about NIN cover or remix. Even some artwork or stuff like that. This could be very interesting.I dont fully understand the subreddit album thing. Like we would vote for our favourite songs to appear on this rnin album?

Almost like he did his job TOO well.I dont expect him to do comedies or anything but I liked that The Social Network allowed the electronic to sort of bubble out in a pleasing way Intriguing Possibilities Carbon Prevails etc. But its all good and if he did nothing but movies scores from now on Id still pick up every one.,nin,comp9vt,3,t5_2qhwq

However if I had to pick one song that I was going to showcase NIN with itd be Closer uncut.   It just gives you that exact sense of theatric brooding the mixture between cerebral and visceral that makes his music so unique.

3341366,0,t3_2yeyw8,gt do you think I should be very concerned about how hes taken a shining to this sort of music? You dont seem all that surprised so I guess not muchgt Should I maybe ask him what he finds so appealing about NINs music what parts of it speaks to him the most?YES! You seem to quite appreciate NIN and also be a kind empathetic father. You and your son might really find this a great bonding experience and a passion that you share. Dont force it though I guessDISCLAIMER  late teenager who came to NIN in his late teens. It blows your mind open with so much new to appreciate. I have a slight tendency towards depression and initially I listened whilst I was at my most reclusive and upset. It helped enormously but months later I would come back to NIN though different albumssongs and really love it. But I would reach a point where it was all I listened to to the extent that I found nondark nonangsty stuff really boring despite being relatively happy. It gradually brings me down as it did last month too and so now Im trying hard to stay away. tldr NIN is great and probably not that harmful. But dont let someone you care about listen to only NIN all the time. It eventually becomes a concern musically emotionally and socially.,nin,cp952b2,4,t5_2qhwq

Many people willingly buying Apple devices because of the style and experience. Most people dont give a damn about which CPU their laptop has and have no interest in learning about specifications either. Also I expect a whole ecosystem of competing nextgen USB devices will explode because they are forcing the industry in that direction. Remember when they took all the optical drives out of Macs?

Furthermore Trents voice does not sound all that great on this song. It sounds like he needs to clear his throat and drink some water.

I cannot condone giving apple a single penny and I will not let my future nin physical collection have any gaps because fuck you Trent you started this! Its just the principal of it.

10009127,0,t3_5izkdf,I think Im in a rare minority who thinks NIN albums have as a rough rule of thumb each been better than the last and improved over time excluding The Fragile and With Teeth which were both a couple of albums ahead and behind of the curve respectively.The comments on nin.com from Trent are unexpected left turn from HM unfriendly fairly impenetrable and also Im sure somewhere it says made to be played loud.That combined with the fact that the computer music has always been there from the early s its industrial yknow? makes me excited to hear the Atticus amp Trent combo on something loud and harderedged NINstyle abrasive. I look at it like thisThe film scores are undeniably layered brilliant work the Oscars and the high demand speak for this for a format that by its very definition has to support the themes of another piece of work WITHOUT stealing attention from the screen I think TampA as Ive now decided to abbreviate them have still managed to push the boundaries of how much depth information and creativity you can possibly squeeze into a score whilst still being a collaborator and not a showstealer. Im struggling to articulate this but I think that makes sense TampA have worked together on four major projects at my count three were designed to accompany the screen and not be distracting one was a minimalist record. On all four TampA have still managed to add unprecedented depths of detail and craftsmanship. Now by the sounds of it theyve set their sights on a loud abrasive kind of NIN and as a team from their track record of delivery I feel like theyve earned nothing but faith and excitement.

10265641,0,t1_dc6uedl,I should clarify I dont think Deviations  is bad by any stretch and some of the tracks offer really cool listening experiences. However many of the more traditionally structured rock songs Were In This Together The Fragile etc. just feel empty without the vocals  missing the melody makes the harmonic mix sound really strange in places.,nin,dc7o01g,1,t5_2qhwq
