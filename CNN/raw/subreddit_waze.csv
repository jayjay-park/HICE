2061972,0,t1_ckwl3b9,OK so this post has been bugging me since I last commented. I know at one point I saw a categories button that pulled up a list of types of places. I went back after your comment and couldnt find it again. What I did find through searching the forums is that there used to be a categories button but it was removed with this version. Im not sure why I thought it was added with this version and Im sorry for giving you bad info. The current method for searching by category is to type in the category type like hotel or fast food and usually the first suggestion as you type will be a category.This doesnt actually work so well at the moment as Wazes place database is still in its early stages. As more places are added by users itll get better. Hope this helped some. ,waze,cl1x6xz,1,t5_2t1g4
2455253,0,t3_2nn1a5,I think its dependent on the number of wazers in the area. If there arent a lot of people using the app it didnt have much data to suggest a route at least thats my understanding.,waze,cmf66j7,2,t5_2t1g4

3538016,0,t1_cpvfeop,It does take them into account. It keeps track of how long it takes to travel through segments of roads so anything with a stop sign or red light will have an average time shortened by those who stop.  Left turns however may not get this treatment depending on how the intersection is wired. A decent editor can fix this so left turn waits are calculated correctly. This usually only happens on divided highways though.So for all of the stop signs most Wazers are probably not coming to a full stop.   The more people drive that street legally the more it will learn the true time it takes.,waze,cpvk1e6,2,t5_2t1g4

3904047,0,t1_cr0zwpq,There seems to be a bit of misconception as to what the different options are for. Not only with police but with map reports as well.Police Visible is meant for cops sitting in an overt location waiting for speeders.Police Hidden is meant for cops in a concealed location such as behind a sign or a building waiting for speeders. Police with someone pulled over should be reported as a hazard on the side of the road assuming theyre on the side of the road because thats what they are.,waze,cr1an10,5,t5_2t1g4

4553219,0,t3_3ddzyn,If you are trying to edit something higher than your rank make a post in the unlock forum. Here is a link Also dont concern yourself with leveling up. We want to make the map better not climb through the ranks as fast as possible. Reach out to your local senior editors. Send them messages ask them if you can help what needs to be done and that you want to learn map editing. They will be more than happy to help and point you in the right direction.,waze,ct4jznz,2,t5_2t1g4

4755184,0,t1_cttx5nq,Yes I did add my house. Im just saying that there should be a better way for begginers. But I guess the majority here uses Share location and that works very well too. Too bad Waze cant implement THAT location shared as HOME or WORK... Maybe in a future update?,waze,cttxpw3,1,t5_2t1g4
4932552,0,t1_cug60ma,Waze seems to be getting better at clumping them together now... Someone has misreported a cop too far up the road the other day by a few hundred meters  I tried reporting him in the right spot and right after it showed my report pop up it got sucked in to the other report and then their indicator added the circle with a  in it.,waze,cugacth,3,t5_2t1g4

5323168,0,t3_3nvk87,Suggestion open Google Maps and use it at the same time. Yes Google owns waze and uses data from waze drivers. But it also adds its own information. I cant say either is better all the time. If they agree great. If they dont then one of them is using a different algorithm or knows something the other doesnt.,waze,cvs3hq8,2,t5_2t1g4
5426109,0,t1_cw4yp40,It is one of their Jbs primary goals. They explained it during a Meetup I went to in Paris about . years ago.But it might take longer than I thought didnt see they added JBs back to beta last week.,waze,cw58pkw,1,t5_2t1g4

6865396,0,t3_49ogzt,This will depend on where you drive if you often drive the same roads if you start your drives on WiFi etc. But Waze is known to have a small data consumption. I use Waze for all my drives always starting them in G which accounts for an average of h per day and over a month I use  MB. Doing it with Google DriveMaps was x more data extensive. BUT Google Maps has an offline mode that works rather good provided you dont have a smartphone that is too old. If I were you Id choose between the GB Data plan or Google Maps Offline. The first allows you to use Waze and your data wherever you are in the country the latter is free. ,waze,d0ui4g8,2,t5_2t1g4

7292534,0,t1_d2738ps,Thats not how laws work. In Michigan for example my landlord cannot evict me from my apartment with no notice just because he feels like it. Even if this is specifically in my lease and I agreed to it its still illegal. Waze cannot take our personal information from the app and sell it to insurance companies though it could sell aggregate data to anyone because its not identifiable to a specific person.Heres their privacy policy which specifically says the following gt Waze does not sell rent or lease your personal information to third parties.,waze,d2741qw,4,t5_2t1g4

8677276,0,t1_d6pgh1f,How would letting Waze access my contacts allow me to send ETA through WhatsApp?If youre assuming I want to use Waze own messaging to send ETA youre mistaken. I want to use a system that does not depend on the recipient having Waze let alone having it running. Waze messaging fails on both counts.,waze,d6qa78h,1,t5_2t1g4
