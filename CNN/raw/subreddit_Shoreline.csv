We dont want people at a certain company that rhymes with bomb ass to get wind of this and try to retain their monopoly under the guise of providing us better service or something else. Ive been waiting for this since a friend of mine got FIOS in a different area of Shoreline back in .  I called CenturyLink  weeks ago when that noticed about the Fiber installation was on my door they knew nothing about it despite To Speak With a Representative About CenturyLink in SHORELINE WA on this website The rep told me that if they were installing it now it would likely be available at the end of the year she could have made that up though. I was trying to see if I could sign up and try to get it as soon as its available.,Shoreline,cwktv8x,1,t5_2solu
