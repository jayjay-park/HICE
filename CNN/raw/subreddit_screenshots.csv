We also have a history with the mob during prohibition. Jackson is located right between Chicago Detroit Ann Arbor and Lansing so it used to be a distribution hotspot for the mob.

Its a pretty cool feature and lets you get away with using a smaller screen... but unfortunately Microsoft no longer support it.
