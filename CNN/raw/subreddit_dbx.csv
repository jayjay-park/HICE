3263472,0,t1_cp00r72,On the other hand Japan has consistently underestimated the popularity of DBZ in western culture. Even the first game to come to America was heavily modified believing that dragon Ball wouldnt be popular without a western spin. ,dbx,cp09qzm,1,t5_33wl8

3309158,0,t1_cp5grb3,Ok thanks a ton! Last question and Ill stop bugging you if they have a chance for a Dragonball I dont have will they always drop it first time? Or even if I get two Materials my first time beating a fighter can they still drop the Dragonball on a consecutive fight? If that makes sense.Basically will they always drop the Dragonball the first time they lose?,dbx,cp5gz7h,1,t5_33wl8

3315344,0,t3_2y4gwc,Yes farming PQs gives you EXP and Zeni you really want EXP since the Story Missions have a rather steep curve of difficulty.You can use the scouter to see enemy levels and you cannot just rush through the story. Try to do the PQs as much as possible and try to find things that you want from them so you dont just grind for the EXP but with an equip or skill in mind.,dbx,cp66ds2,2,t5_33wl8
3320321,0,t3_2y6pv3,My friend and I have seen a lot of information out there about PQ  the Parallel Quest with the Super Vegeta Reward.Most of the debates are about how to bring out Super Vegeta.  We tried multiple times and the only success we had was when we just tried to kill Frieza as quickly as possible.  Not necessarily that speed matters but we ignored everything that was on the internet except to have Frieza kill Krillin.Our final conclusion after Frieza kills Krillin and Goku turns Super it is down to RNG.Let me know if youve had success with a certain pattern because we still havent received the Super Vegeta skill!

3600578,0,t1_cq2onfx,I cant help but feel that a lot of things that affect gameplay like using super saiyan vs super vegeta or picking specific body types for specific stats or even picking stat increasing clothes is primarily for online players who really prioritize this stuff. Im a ki blast saiyan chick never put any thought into my body type I used super saiyan for my entire playthrough and I used the Pilot suit gear which actually lowers ki blasts but I used it because it made me sexy as hell. All that stuff you need to go with for ideal stats and set up are for competitive players. If youre just enjoying the game play how you want to play wear what you want to wear and invest in stats that you think will suit you. ,dbx,cq2ox0v,1,t5_33wl8
