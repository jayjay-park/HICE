10210310,0,t1_dc1ccf7,Thank you for your reply.  You are of course correct that I cant know for sure that it is in fact a mouse.  I was just basing that on the fact that we had caught some mice and weve never caught anything else.  I am sure that it is a dead animal smell unless there are other things that smell like dead animals?  I think that it is a small animal small problem because it is only noticeable in the kitchen.  I have a very strong sense of smell.  We are in a cold climate where unless your house is very new or very mouseproofed you will have some mice.  Transitory dead mouse smells are not really uncommon.  Finding the source would involve making holes in the wall.  Is that usually part of a home inspection if a dead animal smell is noted?Again I appreciate your help!,HomeInspections,dc1e9g9,1,t5_2yuv1
