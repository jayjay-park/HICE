2084825,0,t3_2il2zv,I dont know if the game needs to change hands but we definitely need to get more players in and not just parlour players. In terms of getting new content more regularly I think we really need players who invest cash over free to play players.The biggest problem from where I stand against simply telling people to play and invest a few dollars is Ive never had any assurances that the paid players are treated with any more respect or customer serviceness by the administration than any of the free to play people Ive known were so I cant in good faith tell someone to invest money if they are equally likely to get banned for life with no refund for extremely minor infractions.,ypp,cl4ts4t,2,t5_2skrt
