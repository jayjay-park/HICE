7019761,0,t3_4aq53s,I like taking Bard Thresh and Braum if I cant get naut as support or even Morgana if enemy team took naut from me. With her you can pretty much fuck nauts day up pretty hard since you know them naut mechanics and such.As a toplaner I enjoy Poppy the most but Illaoi also feels pretty good. Illaoi is low mobile but building her tanky and if left unchecked she will have glorious teamfight role. I like taking Iceborn gauntlet andor black cleaver on her. Cleaver only if I get well ahead but if you lose lane early its not that good of a choice. Id also suggest Sion hes pretty fun to play and is tanky af  good cc. But not at the same level as nauti boy.,NautilusMains,d1c1g14,2,t5_390c5

7927633,0,t1_d44k1um,Thats a big point. I main Nauti in the jungle since season  and I still love to play him and I feel so save with him. If I have a team that gets ahead because of my ganks but we lost everysingle teamfight it is so frustrating. I played him for level  some months ago as a jungler and I lost all games only one win. I leveld him with loses and this is so heartbreaking TT.,NautilusMains,d4752lf,1,t5_390c5
8310659,0,t3_4tah5z,When the enemy laner is near a wall or turret for a dive just miss the hook on porpouse on the wall and do your thing. Got so many kills like that... They avoid the hook beautifully thinking that everything is fine then the next second Im WAAing them.,NautilusMains,d5ge141,3,t5_390c5

9771376,0,t3_5f2bej,That sort of happened to me on bard I collected a chime and then i got stuck in a weird animation and just slid across the floor my model halfway in the floor and not also my hat was gone.,NautilusMains,dahje5k,1,t5_390c5
10133444,0,t3_5kzzzc,Youre asking a subreddit full of Nautilus mains or at least players. We might be a little biased.As for if Nautilus is fun or not.. its purely subjective. Personally he strikes just the right chord for me  I find something great in trying to pin down everyone to engage or peel while being an hard to kill monstruosity. But hes not exactly mechanically complex or with a lot of flashy tricks up his sleeve. If you want something high skill cap with non stop highly mechanical action you mightve got the wrong champion.If youre unsure whenever youll like the Titan of the Depths why dont you watch some pro players rolling with him and try him out next time hes on free week?,NautilusMains,dbse5n9,2,t5_390c5
11256534,0,t3_606ae9,Agreed with uechomirage  Naut is a top laner first and foremost he can be played support lemonnation recently played him with ADC mordekaiser but he doesnt get the raw health he needs in the role. Jungle is too carry oriented at the moment hopefully we see some tweaks to jungle tank itemization and things change.,NautilusMains,df7wt5y,1,t5_390c5
