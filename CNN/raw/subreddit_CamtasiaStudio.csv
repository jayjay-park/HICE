7336415,0,t1_d2c373q,oh Ive got one more simple question since you know your Camtasia if youve got the time. So typically I was producing file by choosing custom production settings and choosing to produce an mp. If i change that to MP only up to p is the quality of the production just as good as under custom production settings? Was using this Thinking of using this instead Only looking to change since I got tired of that big folder with all the .html and .config.xml that was created with the video. This stuff just created a really small video and saw under MP only the MB were a tad smaller than custom production settings and I just wanted to make sure the quality is still good. tyvm.,CamtasiaStudio,d2c3lx1,2,t5_37xqj
