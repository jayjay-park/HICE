5063339,0,t1_cuwa81y,Does it have to be? I mean does a director or writer need badges that outline the meaning of each character or their motivations to have a good movie? Or can the audience ascribe a meaning and motivation based on their experience much like any other work of art?I say lets watch a good movie and discuss what we get out of it. If you think that the movie should be seen or interpreted a certain way lets hear it. If it still frustrates you that it seems ill fitted to the category lets see what others say. It should at very least provoke some conversation no? ,CasualNetflix,cuwbof0,3,t5_39r4g
