8690141,0,t3_4v9zu8,This assumes to some extent an originalist point of viewthat the justices merely interpret the will of the founders and do not impose their own views on the constitution or its possible instead that you hold the view that the Supreme Court justices are fit to alter or interpret the law based on their own views which I think would make many uncomfortable.  I think a lot of people instead believe the court should temper their interpretations with consideration for the modern context and view of society.  If thats true then the approval rating of the court does in fact matter as that is a measure of how well they are taking societal views into account.  ,supremecourt,d6rw98i,1,t5_2r1rw
