743266,0,t3_225yug,It really depends on the store. The first store I worked at handled Playbook so badly that either the DM or Regional Manager told us to stop doing it. It was a stressful mess that sent times through the roof.HOWEVER at my new store Im honestly less stressed and its pretty nice. With an Order Support DTO is less stressful. Since all of the Drive Thru Pastries and Warming are fetched for us the DTO is essentially planted and we dont have to waste time and potentially product prepping Drive Thru pastries in the morning. Its a bit easier for our specific store since Drive Thrus pastry and warming queue is sent through a sticker machine but cafe warming and pastries are still done with written triggers or with the Register partner fetching it. Its also nice when they have the time to fetch brewed coffees and pastries for the register partner instead of there being a huge bottleneck while the register partner isnt doing ringing. While at my old store having a headset for DTW and DTO felt like an absolute necessity when OS is really on top of it the DTO is much more free to key in orders without interruption. I sometimes have to ask the DTW to key in an order for me but Im not constantly relying on them to listen to an order and key it in while performing DTW functions. Some partners are absolutely terrible at that so it takes a lot of stress off of me when I DTO.Store Support is wonderful to have around. Theres very little I hate more than customers interrupting me on bar or having to find someone to fetch supplies. Having a partner solely dedicated to keeping the store running is awesome. If theyre around the bar I can always ask them to help a customer with something on the condiment bar that needs urgent restocking such as half and half during the morning rush even though ideally theyll be on top of that.I wont lie the Drive Thru times arent as spectacular as Ive seen while using the old system but I had a lot more time to get used to the old system than I do the new one.

By close I only have white mocha and perhaps frap roast to deal with.Before disassembling I pump hot water through them which makes them easier to get apart. Then I run all the pieces through the dishwasher let them dry and cool down a bit and put them back together. Seems to go easier if theyre a bit warm still idk if Im imagining it. It takes me well under  minutes. If a couple of pieces dont fit back together well I just try them with other pieces. I also have a pair of rubber gloves to protect my hands if theyre being particularly troublesome. I swear the weather affects them or something. Some days theyre a piece of cake other days...AAAARGH.It may be overkill but we never have trouble with our pumps getting stickygross so it works for me.  Except the one week when I opened four days in a row and my closers didnt switch out the white mocha pump at any point. Had to soak the whole thing in hot water for awhile to get it apart at all.

Basically you want enough decaf ready to get you through the rest of the day. when making a pour over put the filter into the cone on the metal stand. scoop LEVEL SCOOPS very important! of your decaf using the tbsp scoop into the filter.   scoops. prime your water then fill your pour over pitcher to the correct line.  Place a sleeve on your cup and put your cup under the cone on the drip tray. Pour slowly from the outside edge towards the middle of the filter.  Make sure you get all the grounds wet to ensure your coffee is properly brewed.  If youre making a venti you have to stop half way and let the coffee drain out of the filter because the cone cant hold oz of water. wait until there are single drops of coffee coming out of the filter about a minute.  Your pour over is finished.  Remove the cup lid it hand it out.  Dump the filter into the trash rinse the cone and place it upside down on top of the metal rack.  Thats it!  If someone wants room youre going to have to dump a little out.  You cant put in less water because thatll mess with the grindstowater ratio so remember that.If someone wants half caf make a short decaf for a shorttallgrande and a tall decaf for a venti.

I work at a licensed store and our registers dont allow us to delete or change anything so I had to void the whole order. She gets huffy about having to wait a few seconds. Then she gets huffy about having to repeat which frappuccino she ordered. Then she says on the latte only do one squirt. .....one pump of what maam? .....MOCHA???!!!!!?? Like I am the stupidest person shes ever spoken to in her life. I explain that a plain latte doesnt have mocha in it that she can just order a one pump mocha next time. Of course she gets shitty and says yes a latte does have mocha. Ok lady! She then orders four venti ice waters mostly ice hardly any water in a drink carrier. So after I hand off the drink cups I go to get the waters. I fill the cups packed full of ice then water just to fill in the gaps. As Im making the waters Im setting them down on the counter but not handing them off yet. Lady is of course hovering over the handoff and says I SAID to put those in a drink carrier! ....I know maam Im just about up grab it for you!  so we give them everything and they walk away. About  mins later the lady comes back up after her and her family had sat down to eat. She tries to be quiet when she tells my coworker she asked for mostly ice hardly any water but these waters are mostly water hardly any ice!

However youre probably going to need one person to be making drinks so have the person who is wiping down and setting up making drinks while the one person washing is designated soley to washing. If the bar person is still making drinks and the washer is done they can set up and wipe down.Our store ideally would like to start breaking down at  pm but sometimes it doesnt get done until .,starbucks,cknckl8,1,t5_2qwza

Especially in the morning theyll come in and take up nearly all the indoor seating while they charge their cell phones. We sometimes find cell phonestablets that they own charging in our back cabinets weve taken to locking the cabinets which was not something we had to worry about previously as a result of this. We have one old man in particular who circles our building like a vulture all day leaves his shit sprawled on tables outside all day while he walks all over the place complaining to us when his garbage gets stolen as if its somehow our responsibility then comes inside in the early evening sprawls his shit all over the tables inside and sits there watching Netflix on his Kindle until we close. They tear up our bathrooms stink the place up and sit outside panhandling throughout the shopping center were in generally not right in front of sbux though. Im just sort of surprised the company and the shopping center havent done more to deal with the situation because I have to imagine that the customers dont like it. Its certainly not pleasant for us when we have to look over our shoulders because the drunk homeless guy we just asked to leave is still lingering around the building when our shift is over and we have to walk out to our cars.,starbucks,cl5g868,1,t5_2qwza

Its shares of stock that are given to you for free but you have to stay with the company  years to get it. This is vesting. This is what a vested interest is. So lets say you are given shares last year. This year  shares will vest and be yours to keep as well stock or sell for cash. Next yearyear two it will vest another  so  stock becomes available the next year the last one.Every November bean stock is distributed on a different day typically mid November. Also baristasshiftsmanagers all get different amounts. So this is also part of your total pay package to also consider if considering advancement. Starbucks is trading at . this second we have been in the  range latly we are hoping to hit  in the next two years.The process of selling is.log on to fidelity.com if you have not turned your account on and have been with the company longer then  ask your manager I dont remember how to turn it on.go to accounts and select your individual account. What is in there you may sell..sell it.the SECsecurities and exchange commission will take  business days to approve the sale at which point money will be then put into your fidelity account.  .A TAXES they will taken out by fidelity when you sell in the form of stock so exsell  shares but  share covers stockyou get  shares worth to sell.  IF ANYONE KNOWS HOW TO CHANGE THIS TO PAY THE TAX WHEN I FILE IN JANUARY please let me know..transfer the money. Select a check. This then takes about a week to get a check cut and sent to you. There is an option for direct deposit but it takes if I remember correctly  weeks to get that turned on....so if you set this up wait to sell your stock and let the market do its this Starbucks is going to be extra busy this next month so the price may go up on your sharesmore Congratulations.

I had one for  years and it made  doubles every day and more on weekends before the pump finally bit the dust.  GREAT machine. It has a pressurized portafilter but since the head is a standard size you can get a regular one for it if you want.    It is possible with too fine a grind and to strong a tamp to cause the machine to not be able to push the water through but it takes some doing.

2677186,0,t3_2qo7lw,As a current Starbucks Team Leader in a Target location I have quite a bit to say. There are many problems. First and foremost are the resources rather lack of given to effectively run a Starbucks. Target knows how to run a Target but not a Starbucks  this is the ultimate issue. Im sure there are reps at both TargetStarbucks corporate offices that exclusively handle the Target account just based on number of locations but Starbucks obviously lets Target run a loose canon when it comes to Tarbucks and the results can be disastrous for the Starbucks brand. Perhaps Target gets a little more leniency and ability to bend the rules since they are the largest US licensee. Who knows?First and foremost I often see Starbucks companyoperated partners complain about lack of labor in their stores. Target payroll allocations for Tarbucks makes a Starbucks company operated store look like its raining payroll. On an normal week Target allocates me  payroll hours to run a Tarbucks. For the entire week.  of those hours go to me. That leaves me with  hours left to give to my minimum Starbucks requirement of  certified baristas. Thats  hours a week per person. Very few people want a job with  hours a week. But we cannot employ less than  certified baristas at any given store  thats part of the license agreement.When operating that lean things like training cleaning and generally getting your team to the next level in terms of productbrand knowledge is virtually impossible. For example when I train a new team member we essentially have to throw the barista basics program out the window because my new team members train alongside me while I work a shift behind the bar theres rarely double coverage. Because of this training is inconsistent and fragmented and its virtually impossible to use the training blocks. Plus chronic team member turnover is a plague that Target cant shake which also doesnt help. So youre always working with a green team.Additionally in a Starbucks company operated store youre surrounded by layers of shift supervisors assistant managers store managers district managers etc. that eat sleep and breathe Starbucks. Not the case at Target. Its just me. My boss oversees a larger part of the entire Target store of which Starbucks is a tiny fraction. He knows nothing about Starbucks  couldnt tell you the difference between a latte or a cappuccino much less make them. Its not his fault that he doesnt know  thats just how Target operates. Otherwise its me and my baristas. No assistant managers shift supervisors etc. Quarterly DSVs and a few other inbetween visits from our Starbucks LS district manager are the only other exposure to actual Starbuckstrainingbrand that I get  direct from someone who actually receives a paycheck from Starbucks and knows what shes talking about. Otherwise its random emails and internal updates from Target headquarters teams who clearly know virtually nothing about Starbucks. A funny example right before holiday promo Target marked down all core merchandise  to lighten inventory and make room for dot collection and the like. The clearance should have ended and core merch should have gone back to full price but the Target headquarters team who controls this stuff let it go salvage  this is when another Target process team unrelated to the Tarbucks operation  they wear redkhaki removes merchandise from the salesfloor and ships it out of the store for garbage or donation to places like Goodwill. So across the country right before our  holiday promo Tarbucks nationwide ended up tossing tens of thousands of dollars worth of core merchandise. About a week later Target directed to reorder everything we just threw away. Oops! Like I said before Target knows how to run Target. Not Starbucks.  I love Target dont get me wrong but Ive always said Starbucks needs to be more aggressive with controlling how licensees such as Target staffrun their stores. Otherwise Target is just trying to run Starbucks as a halfhearted lossleader that provides a better shopping experiencedestination.,starbucks,cn812ig,15,t5_2qwza

Maximise those gains realize when opportunities are missed and above all lead by example. Shifts can be friends with baristas its normal but an ASM is akin to a general.

2951836,0,t3_2tuyfq,Some pranks that were regularly pulled back in the day on vets and new partners alike. Can you empty out the hot water dispenser? We need to clean the inside.. Take a puck of used espresso put it on a for here plate dress it up with whipped cream and chocolatecaramel drizzle and ask Want a piece of my brownie?. Mix salt into their drink when they are not looking. Also mix any clear syrup into their drink when they are not looking. This one would regularly start a prank war that would last months. Everybody would smell their drinks before taking a sip if it left their sight.. Come up to the drive thru speaker and order an impossible drink such as May I have a Tall Grande Venti Extra hot no whip  pumps of sugar free vanilla caramel drizzle and make sure there is no foam on it! Oh and add an extra shot to it! The key is to say it quickly and with confidence adding a ton of modifiers out of order of course youd be surprised how many baristas get extremely confused before catching on to the fact that you ordered a Tall Grande Venti instead of a real drink.. Set a timer to go off shortly after the openers arrive and hide it somewhere hard to find. Better yet set ALL the timers and leave them scattered throughout the store. Only do this if the openers the next day love you because if they dont you will really piss them off and forever have enemies in the morning shift.These are just a few.

Someone has to pick up your garbage although I hear being a garbageman is actually decent money.It sucks that you have to work  jobs. Just being a partner parttime makes my back hurt. I also feel underpaid at hr which I understand is actually above average for starting wage.But.... no a human does not have to do all the partner jobs.Im a recent hire in the s. I have been impressed with how incredibly automated everything is but the reality is it could be automated even more destroying my job. For example I heard that the introduction of the Sbux card was unpopular because it decimated tips. I too dislike it for that reason BUT... Thats short term thinking. Long term the logical terminus of the kind of thinking the card represents is just eliminating the register partner altogether. I have been to restaurants with menus as complicated as our drink selection and they dont have a single person FoH taking orders. When you walk in there is an ATMstyle row of iPads that you simply tap your order in.All other tasks could be robotized right now too. Making change warming food grinding and brewing coffee... All partners who are not on bar fulltime are only being paid to carry inventory between various machines that automatically perform tasks. There are only  jobs at Starbucks that I would anticipate to be performed by humans  years from now. Barista actually making drinks. Janitor lifelong underclass job. SM and ASM mostly to manage inventory and orderingIts the same at Walmart and Amazon theyre paying humans to take inventory off a robotized delivery system and handcart it to the right place in a robotized warehouse. Eventually theyll invent a robot that does the inbetween task and all those people will be on the street.We need to face the reality that there will be far less WORK available in the future because robots will be doing everything. The only solution is political. Just like you said we cant let people fall through the cracks. At the same time we cant pay people to stay on a job that a robot could be doing instead.

Bob offers monetary incentives for high qasa scores and writeups for poor ones so people generally scramble to get things nice. Daytoday the fridge temps etc are rarely rarely checked and it can be a week before someone realizes that a fridge is running on a broken thermometer or is missing a thermometer. I am concerned that if I use a qasa selfaudit to start this conversation that it will be on me for not upholding the standards since Id be filling it out while on duty. I doubt anyone else would get in trouble.The DM is pretty strict as far as I know pretty sure thats why Bob is bending so many rules. I always thought they were pretty cool until a few incidents where partners committed fireable offenses and werent terminated because our store had lost a huge number of hires in a matter of months maybe  people and the DM was concerned that losing more would flag our store in some way. Wish there had been more investigation into why it was happening So are the problems I described enough to make a call to the hotline? Ive never worked at another store and Im definitely paranoid that especially since Im the rules person this stuff isnt a big deal other than things I cant prove such as giving away free stuff for tips etc.,starbucks,cox4rnz,1,t5_2qwza

4763859,0,t1_ctuy3o0,With my specific example this guy isnt beating the system. Hes just not paying for the coffee were putting in the cup. In order to get that price the customer had a long conversation with my manager stating that the espresso takes up so much room that it isnt fair to be charged for the coffee.In general my issue is the fact that there are other customers who play by the rules so why is it fair for certain people to get special treatment solely because we know theyll be obnoxious about it otherwise. The company DOES care and they DO have rules about it but employees dont like to deal with difficult customers and instead of standing their ground they just say okay and move on. Weve built this idea that the customer is always right and the customers always get what they want but if everybody could just come in a just tell us how much they feel like paying that day then whats the point? Going back to my original example there are many people who come through every day pay for a quad espresso and receive a quad espresso. Why dont we fill their cups with coffee too? It isnt fair that they pay the same price but dont receive product.Its not about the companies its about consistent customer treatment. Why are some people special? The answer is that theyre not special theyre assholes who do what they want and dont care about anyone else but themselves.This seems like a huge rant about a small thing but Ive had a lot of time to think about it.tldr people are assholes and dont care about others.,starbucks,ctv11px,-1,t5_2qwza

4814012,0,t1_cu197bu,Yes and no. Historically speaking American coffee roasting has had two schools of thought with the east coast preferring a lighter roast as historically theyve gone through the entire spectrum of coffee history watered down brews brews cut with things like cereals and other ingredients to stretch it etc. Whereas western and west coast roasts were often very dark due to the history of westward expansion and trailblazing. Dark overroasted and heavier coffee is as much a part of the west as the gold rush and frontier settlements. It is not a coincidence that Starbuck is a company from Washington that learned to roast coffee from a company in California and roasts dark. The business need of providing a consistent roast worldwide is an important factor as well but as with any gourmet food item the perfect method for roasting or brewing is always going to depend on the background.,starbucks,cu1ch1q,29,t5_2qwza

4897109,0,t3_3hwlyk,I watched a family crowd around the handoff area once while I was waiting for my drink. I figured I could elbow in but I wasnt in a rush and eavesdropping on frivolous drama is fun.Anyway the mouthpiece of the crew grabbed my drink and drank some then loudly complained that it was disgusting.  I ordered a Trenta light ice BTL with  Peach which is what was called along with my name.  Im a gal and this guy was oblivious.  The barista made a little signal to tell me he would remake mine.  No rush. Whatever.So my drink comes up no way I can get to it through four people. Jackwagon grabs it again and loudly berates the barista for making his drink wrong. I just want a green tea. Why is that so hard for you? Barista is clearly flustered.I have posted here before that I could not work at Starbucks. I have neither the patience nor the tact.  So knowing that the guy behind the counter has to smile and take it I thought I would chime it.  Excuse me this guy is clearly more important than I am seeing as he has taken sips of my drink twice. Thanks for testing for poison by the way.  I am okay with you making his drink first since he is clearly some kind of foreign dignitary and needs hydration immediately.The one downside is that he got super quiet and I couldnt eavesdrop anymore.

Minimum for employment is  hours so your SM is fully within their power to schedule her for exactly  hours a week and to hire someone for weekends only. Based on what you said your SM is likely just being a tool and doesnt want to closework later than the morning shift. It sucks but unless the store performance starts lacking and the DM starts asking questions there isnt much anyone can do.

Alternately we dont have shorthand for it and our bar person will stare at the cup for a second before figuring out what you want.Sall cool. Were happy to make you want you want. Just please dont make me touch your phone. I dont want the legal responsibility if it slips my hand and I dont want the germs that come with touching a phone while Im trying to work food service.

It exactly mirrors when majority of Americans get excited for Christmas. It starts right after Halloween and ends right after Christmasthe Christmas shopping season. Starbucks is doing its best to be PC and also celebrate Christmas. Because they truly are lets not make any misconception about that. I dont see them make special cups for Passover or Ramadan or anything else just when Christmas comes around. So when Christians are getting butt hurt now that the cups dont say MERRY FUCKING CHRISTMAS all over them they need to shut the fuck up.Can confirm Im a devout Christian.Edit Oh and great job trolling that twat.

6081816,0,t3_3yumve,I think Starbucks is a lot less becoming neighborhood caf and more becoming the McDonalds of coffee in and out quick. Which is not necessarily bad. If thats the clientele that upper management sees as making them money then they should pursue that clientele and focus on growing that business. I dont want to work for them anymore if that is the case and Im sure theyll lose a certain type of customers. Like me for example. I am a student and I would rather go downtown to my favorite independent coffee shop. A lot of students do the same and that coffee shop has become the place to hang out whereas the Starbucks stores near my school have become a place for homeless people people running pyramid schemes out of a Starbucks office and the guy who lets his smelly dog sit under the table all day and gets away with it by claiming its a service animal.But if Im looking for a quick in and out experience Ill go to Starbucks much in the same way Ill grab McDonalds if I want something to eat real fast whereas if I want an experience and truly great coffee Ill go to Molinos my favorite coffee shop just like I go to a favorite mom and pop sandwich shop when I want an experience and great food.Its an adjustment in the way Starbucks is doing business and really is not necessarily a bad thing in my opinion. The annoying part is that Starbucks still wants to claim it is the neighborhood store that is a part of the community when we all know that is such bullshit. But once you look at it for how it truly is its obvious. Starbucks just is the McDonalds of coffee and that is what the shareholders want it to be.,starbucks,cygt3ks,11,t5_2qwza

You dont have to enter the bag stars right away  you can wait for bonus events. When I topped up my card I get  stars alone. You should have no problems keeping gold. Any transaction in store that takes even a cent off the card is a star. At the beginning of Dec I was almost at  stars. Now my account says I am gold until Dec  since I got  stars that month alone due to all the crazy offers they had.

6473346,0,t1_czov0ig,I more or less agree with your direction here but let me clarify the scanning thing.In the POS there are TWO ways we can redeem a reward. Normally if you just say hey I have a couponreward I want to use in item A then instead of bringing up the Tender by SBUX card screen I open the discount screen and there is a series of buttons use free reward use birthday reward and enter coupon code . I select the appropriate one and ask you to scan this looks for the reward and then forwards me to the tender screen where I am asked to finish the transaction with CC Sbux Card Cash. On this screen I can NOT see the rewards I just hit the free reward button and if one is available it is automatically applied.But in the OP what happened is the cashier pulled up the inquiry screen which is different it tells me all items available to your card without trying to tender them similar to the way we can run the card to find out the balance. The inquiry screen has a list of however many rewards and then includes a button to redeem which will apply them to the order without tendering. To use these rewards each one has to be scanned individually against the phone or card which is what happened here. To add to insult to injury from this customers perspective she would have to reload the inquiry screen for each reward in addition to scanning to redeem the reward. To do three items there would be at least six and possibly seven scans if she went this route. Compare this with two maybe three the normal way.Thats not to say the guy is rightsomething is going on herebut thats what set him off.,starbucks,czow1c1,5,t5_2qwza

Theres a sweet spot heh of steaming dairy milk where the temperature denatures the lactose just enough so that it starts to separate into galactose and glucose around . This is why lattes at specialty coffee shops can taste sweet.

I told her I just asked her and she mentioned they helped her. Not charged her. I ring her up and she was then like so you charged them separately right? And I told her she never mentioned that. She got pissed. Started telling me to find someone who can do their job. I politely yet angrily told her that its also her job to communicate and to tell us next time for us to ring it up separately. I give her the stuff and hand her the card. As I hand it out she snatches it....but by snatching it the bitch makes drops it. Then blames me. All I hear her say is GOD DAMN IT!!!!. I give her a this is beyond my issue look and tell the car behind her to swerve to the side so she can get off. No. She refuses. youre getting off. And youre getting my card. Excuse me? Yes.

After cleaning the pastry trays for the end of the night pastries that will be donated we put parchment paper underneath so we can give it a quick wipe down and not have to reclean the trays.Sweep and Mop the back room and behind the bar area early like  hours before closing and hope whoever youre working with doesnt make a mess or drop anything so you can just remop quickly.Clean all steaming pitchers and utensils like  hours before close and have  regular and  soy pitcher ready until the end. Ice Tea and Ice Coffee pitchers into cups an hour before close and clean them as well.And I guess restock everything you can right away and as much as you can lets say a few hours before you close that way its very little you need to grab towards the end of the shift.,starbucks,d091soz,5,t5_2qwza

These are the people who were actually getting hurt by the current system and it is possible to turn beverage only customers into customers like this and people dedicated to this particular spending habit will still see rewards every couple of weeks or less.

I didnt like to be alone because I would drown in my own thoughts.  Customer support was not good for me because I wasnt really talking to anybody to keep my mind off of it.  I liked to be on reg or bar so I could have some human interaction.  I was really good at hiding it but one day I broke down.  Now I take an antidepressant I know medication is not always the answer but it makes me calmer and Im not a zombie like some people are when they take them.  Im a better version of myself because my serotonin levels are finally back to normal.  Also the other comments that mention calling the employee assistance hotline are awesome!  I have a friend that used this.  Talking to somebody is always helpful.  Do not let your anxiety define who you are.  You are bigger than that!  Remember that you are not alone.

Also tell them a million times to look at all of the items on the POS and find out what they are. Tell them to look at how many pumps and shots are on the POS. They will have more than enough time on POS. Thats where its going to settle in. Teach them CS and other things well and let them learn bar more as they work shifts.

There will be no till drop bags. You unassign a person sweep the box count that money put it in the deposit bag in door  and record it on the computer. If the till not gonna be used anymore you will need to count it back to the original amount and drop extra cash into the deposit bag. At the end of the day the only thing that closer needs to do is seal the bag and finalize deposit on the computer. Drop the deposit in door . Should take no more than  extra min. Its actually super easy. Door  is for keeping dis hied deposits tip drops. Your SM should provide you training before you launch it. There are videos on the hub available under digital resource that explain each step and why its done that way. Watch them! They are very helpful SM will be getting reports with each partners till activity all counting in and out drops deposits and such. It will make the cash management process easier for SM to track. SM will be able to tell exactly who assigned where and what time which SS unassigned who how much was dropped and so on. Catching thieves will me so much easierAlso actual cash policies havent changed.

It will guide you through the program and youll do tastings with your teamTLDM periodically. At the end a final tasting andor test will be given by your DM.

Learn the role as best you can and teach it to other partners when you have time. Coach coach coach. If a partner is stepping off bar to grab Vanilla let them know to use a signal or at the very least communicate the need to CS. If POS person is constantly in the back grabbing lidscups tell them to use signals or at the very least let you know what they need so they can stay planted. If they use signals effectively and communicate with you you will have your flex time to get your shift tasks done each CS cycle with no issue. With  people its hard to run CS but in a Cafe only store it can be done. POS person flexes to bar whenever there is a drink to make and if they get a few guests at a time they grab the CS for support.Ill be honest with you.

8924522,0,t3_52grd6,I worked at Starbucks for  years through college and after during the recession while looking for work. At year  I was a barista had been a shift lead but stepped down to finish my degree and I was making more than the shift leads I worked with because id been there so long. Our DM decides that Im an unnecessary overhead and within a month of her taking the district over after our store being in a different district for around  years my hours start getting cut. I have wide open availability with only Sundays requested off because at the time I was volunteering at my church and I was there pretty much all day. My hours start consistently dipping to between  and  a week and my manager keeps reminding me that I need to keep a minimum of  a week or I could be terminated. I keep telling her to schedule me more then and in the mean time Im picking up basically every shift that comes along...I have kids that are still in high school who requested the minimum hours possible working  a week and she cant find any hours for me. Picking up shifts I manage to stay above the . Then my hours start dropping to  a week. One week I had a single hour split shift  hours from am to   from pm to . The week after that and the next three that followed I had zero. Then I got written up for being  over on a till I had counted back as being perfectly fine. Called my manager up and asked her what the deal was. She told me she would love to give me the hours f I would only open up my Sundays but it was staring to look like she would have to let me go.So I only need to open up my Sundays?Yes.So wheres the other hours going to come from?What?You gonna work me all  hours on only Sunday or what? My entire week is wide open but that one day and you arent scheduling g me anything. So are you gonna work me  hours on Sundays is that it?Scubsurf...No you listen to me. You think Im stupid? Ive been with the company longer than you have you think I havent seen this happen before? Youre pulling whatever you can out of your ass to get rid of me. And thats fine you do whatever you want but this is bullshit and you know it so dont lie to me and dont try to pretend youre looking out for me.Scubsurf it isnt like that why dont you come in tomorrow and we can talk?No thanks. Bye.Later that same week a manager from about  years earlier called me up understaffed desperate for a closer asked f I wanted to pick up a few shifts a week. I asked him if he wanted to transfer me there permanently. Because of him I ended up working there another year until I got going on my career and able to pay my bills.

9176895,0,t1_d8f2zrz,Thank you for calling the Enterprise Help Desk. The help desk is aware that partners cannot connect to cash management and are actively working to remedy the problem.With the missing cash  of the time its an error making change with the safe and if it doesnt cancel out theyll have to look at the tapes for the entire day anyway in case it was fine when you counted in just in case you lied about the starting amount and pocketed the missing money.  It looks like less accountability but in practice its just getting rid of the paper trail they dont use anyway.,starbucks,d8f8llz,3,t5_2qwza
9177765,0,t3_55zh4i,Weve had it a couple months. We do a combination of the old system and the new system. We still count over the safe and manually record who is assigned to each drawer. We still count the full deposit at the end of the night. Honestly weve really had to rely on the strength of our barista closers to get out on time. I wish we did a deposit for all but the last one or two tills at the end of the night so you have a couple of hours to deposit between when your precloser leaves and close. The final two would roll over to the next day. Im the fastest at it in our store and it still takes me a full twenty minutes.  My biggest complaint is that there isnt a lot of accountability for how many deposits and tip bags are in the second part of the safe. We used to count them once daily and again its unusual for us to even open door two anymore. Weve had a couple of recorded tip bags go missing in the last few weeks which makes me nervous. Could be accounting error. Could be stolen. Could be a glitch. Hard to say.,starbucks,d8fckfz,5,t5_2qwza

I highly doubt it will be a year but you have a good case which makes it possible he will serve some time in jail especially if he is a repeat offender.

For federal reasons the hiring manager has to complete an I where they sign saying they physically inspected the proper forms of identification.  This is in addition to the W that you fill out yourself.   Ive worked HR at other jobs and we always advised college interns of this week in advance so they can make arrangements.  That being said Ive seen managers sign for it before with a copy.  There is no way to ever audit it since the only way to record it is by them making a copy.   Which is what you have.  Call and ask to speak to the person who you will actually be meeting with on day one and ask them directly.  Most likely theyll say youre fine.

I recently went off the medicine because I wanted to see how Id do without it Id gotten the help for what Id gone through and I felt I could deal without the medicine. Some days are alright but this entire week has been filled with anxiety attacks. Ill excuse myself to the bathroom take a few deep breaths and try to calm down. It usually works.I also like to read before work. Go in get my coffee and read and relax for an hour as a customer before I clock into the crazy. It allows me to be in that environment of Starbucks but escaping into another world through a book.

Even outside the legal selling hours. You either had to find help from and Eve store somehow or another stores partner could have their SM set them up for jurisdictional training which takes  to  min then they could take shifts at an Evenings store.So if your store or a partner at your store is in trouble and needs coverage too bad the chances of actually finding outside help does down substantially and it was already pretty low.xpost from first Evenings topic earlier,starbucks,dc52plu,15,t5_2qwza

Im graduating from the Starbucks ASU program in may and I also took GIT so feel free to ask me any questions!You indeed work on web development from graphic design  understanding theory of basic design as well interpreting potential client needs. Youll learn to code using HTML  CSS I had prior knowledge before taking courses but its okay if you dont theyll start from the very beginning foundations! as well as learn flash  JavaScript  etc to support and flesh out your web designs. Youll have to take a few business courses known as the enterprise  its a weird title lol and perhaps some precalc  statistics depending on how far along youre in your major when you initially begin the program. I already had credits from a local community college so I skipped those as well as the other basic requirements. Though the program may have changed slightly regarding these since I started two years ago when it was first launched. Youll have a ton of projects in lieu of traditional exams and a lot of homework to reinforce your knowledge and skills but its very flexible. You should be able to go in many different directions with GIT after graduation! ,starbucks,debcwdm,2,t5_2qwza

10973485,0,t3_5wjm68,I had a complaint called in about me too on this very issue. I had insufficient change and explained that my manager explained that. We offered to accept a card or to let her come back with small change if she had nothing else. She used some curse words at both the manager and I.Several minutes of fuming I was watching the clock later? Small bills and a credit card appeared. .???We exchanged names and gave her a business card. She explained she was going to call corporate to complain about our customer service.Next day she picked up her order and I as pleasant as I was able to manage thanked her for having small bills. She asked if the manager was in and if corporate had called yet. No I explained they are off today but I expect Ill know more once shes in.  gt Ok just be expecting a coaching call from corporate.It was awkward to say the least . I dont mind getting coaching if it is deserved but I was confused as to why she was still upset the next day after three people had explained policy and why we couldnt make change. THE NEXT DAY. We didnt yell at her. We gave her options. We were polite. We explained why and that we werent just being obnoxious but that we really WERE limited in what we could do. The customers behind her DT had no idea we just apologized for the delay and moved the line once she pulled forward..Edit I CAN and sometimes DO accept large bills. But I had already accepted a  earlier followed by a looong string of s all of which were dropped per policy. I can no longer access them and had drained my small bills in the twentytrain.

Last night I found a nonfat in my bar fridge that expires tomorrow. Ive emptied at least a dozen expired whips into the back sink this week. My normal closing shift precloser and myself are all so sick of coming in to work to a disaster zone and cleaning up after the mids that we seriously considered walking out and abandoning the store the other night because the openers will not stop bitching about how we keep getting out late but they choose not to see how the mids have been actively or is it passively? setting us up for failure every damn day for the past two weeks.Nitro kegs are just on my list because theyre irregularly shaped and unstackable and where the fuck do we put them.,starbucks,dfnjday,18,t5_2qwza
