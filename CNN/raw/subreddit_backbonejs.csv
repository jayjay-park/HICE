I even read an article at  from the author of marionette admitting that the module system was lacking.In larger applications I would use the layoutview as a type of controller. It makes more sense to use this as a controller because it acts as a hub for all of your viewsmodelscollections.As a side note Ive had a lot of success using the backboneassociations plugin with marionette applications and using the layoutview,backbonejs,cilj7md,3,t5_2sahr

2923066,0,t3_2tmeiy,Could you provide your full requirejs config file and actual code sample of usage? Its paths not path. Theres a comma missing between nunjucks pathtonunucksslim.min and templates templates. The first line of functionBackbone Templates Nunjucks  template  doesnt make sense there template part is used to define an object key and is not a statement. The render function does nothing but define an unused html variable. The regex error does not seem to be related to requirejs but without the full config I cant tell.Heres a valid requirejs config I use    require.config      baseUrl staticjs      paths         jquery libsjqueryjquery..        lodash libslodashlodash..        backbone libsbackbonebackbone..        marionette libsbackbonebackbone.marionette..        text libsrequirejstext..            shim         underscore  exports          backbone  deps jquery underscore exports Backbone              underscore is aliased to lodash      map    underscore lodash        deps       optimize uglify      generateSourceMaps true      preserveLicenseComments false    My layout is like this    staticjsconfig.js the file above    staticjslibsbackbonebackbone...js    ...Heres a module    definemarionette functionMarionette      use strict      var App  new Marionette.Application      App.addRegions        mainRegion mainRegion            return App     Heres the initialization.    requiremodulesapp backbone functionApp Backbone       use strict      App.start      Backbone.history.start      window.App  App    ,backbonejs,co0d10a,2,t5_2sahr
