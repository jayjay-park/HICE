307943,0,t3_1xlkuu,I was in this situation and I just left without telling them.  Might not be the best way to handle the situation but they called me after a few weeks and asked me what was going on and if I still lived there.  I told them I had an apartment and then I went back to get the rest of my stuff.,Explainlikeimscared,cfcopgl,2,t5_2xiog

These all discuss the past few years and how it got us here. For the reassurances part... as much as everyone says theyre getting behind Trump I suspect if he were to be president wed see a significant amount of obstruction in his goals. Nearly everything a president has to do must be supported by another branch of government including going to war. Sending troops is not necessarily from what I understand but calling a full fledged war hes not supposed to be able to do that. Even the supreme court justice pick must be supported by congress as were seeing with Merrick Garland. People have made it clear they want to work with him but whether they actually do is going to be a different story. ,Explainlikeimscared,d3l40pg,2,t5_2xiog
