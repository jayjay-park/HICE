288886,0,t3_1xeivf,What part of the valley?Woodland Hills athletic club has  squat racks  platform and some bumper plates. Its not the most amazing gym...In fact its small but its empty on the weekends since its mostly just working professionals that go beforeafter work or during lunch.,SFV,cfaphde,1,t5_2saa9
292863,0,t1_cfb45bw,Not entirely sure to be honest. If you show up and ask for a  day pass at no cost theyll give it to you. Im on a company membership month no contract or signup fees. Not entirely sure how much Im saving per month compared to just a regular gym membership.Id still suggest contacting them to find out specifics to be honest. This place still beats the hell out of LA FitnessHour Fitness...Ive never been to Powerhouse up in Chatsworth but I believe they may have more variety and options for powerlifters.,SFV,cfb4c4e,1,t5_2saa9

3443208,0,t3_2znlo6,Oh hey! I know you! I can totally testify to how amazing of a massage therapist you are! usleepertown is awesome. Not only have I known her for years and she is one of the best people in my life but she has been working on me since she moved back in the area. Shes amazingly professional and a joy to chit chat with if youre up for it. Shes intelligent and funny. She always does an amazing job working on the crazy knots I get in my shoulders from work and stress and she helped me out so much when I was pregnant. Seriously if you need a massage therapist contact her. Youre not gonna regret it. And come on she comes to you! How much easier can it freaking get?!And I know this may come off as overly praisey and fake but I swear its not. I just happened to see this post know her and have had her work on me so I wanted to share my experience. Dont mind the throwaway usleepertown you dont need to see my post history. Haha. ,SFV,cpkr2cp,4,t5_2saa9
3784037,0,t3_33pzcw,Honestly its usually an older crowd. But the staff is all pretty young. And the owner is a really cool guy. They have lots of TVs around the bar and they have the really good bbq. They smoke all their meat in the parking lot out back. When I lived in Agoura I would be there at least twice a week.,SFV,cqnly08,2,t5_2saa9

10048533,0,t3_5jbz8q,Mine goes through periods like this on and off for  weeks we were experiencing regular slowdowns and full loss of connectivity for a few hours every morning.When the issue got resolved I actually noticed my speeds were higher than they had been before so Im wondering if perhaps part of this is being caused by hardware changes during the TWC to Spectrum transition. I was told recently that the company was reprovisioning in some neighborhoods and that it was causing temporary issues.If you get phone service from TWCSpectrum and are using a splitter to separate the coax line for the connections to the phone and internet modems you may want to insist that they send a tech out to run a second line into your house the splitter setup causes issues in some installations and having separate lines for each modem actually generally helps with connectivityspeed issues.Also though I hate to have to say it TWC was always like this the service can be really inconsistent and in some neighborhoods slowdowns and periodic connectivity issues are a regular occurance that the company either cannot or will not fix.,SFV,dbhclay,1,t5_2saa9
