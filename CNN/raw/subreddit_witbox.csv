5971202,0,t1_cy27nk7,I used a variant of that one I used this one  Fitment is pretty bad. Required tons of sanding to get the pieces to fit together. With the exception of the slide all the pieces that had to fit together the male and female parts were the exact same measurement when I measured with my calipers ie the clip was .mm and the hole for it was .mm...,witbox,cy2ct79,1,t5_3afha
9114635,0,t1_d79sieo,I have printed that thing and tried it on my witbox... to be honest I have not found any difference whatsoever... On the other hand I print at C so I may just naturally get less curling.,witbox,d87fk4w,1,t5_3afha
