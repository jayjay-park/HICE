4459603,0,t1_csssujq,I remember when Eat It came out. In D was my introduction to Al and it wasnt until probably Dare To Be Stupid that I also gotlistened to Weird Al Yankovic. So Ive been a fan for a LONG time pretty much since the beginning. Nostalgia defiinitely plays a big part in my or anybodys list. It was interesting going through and deciding which are the skippable songs as most of them were the parodies. Very few original songs I consider skippable. And I also tried to consider if I thought the song was skippable because I just dont like the song or because Ive heard it so many times over the years. It was an interesting little project that killed a bit of time at work this morning ,weirdal,csstaoe,1,t5_2roy5

7751808,0,t1_d3mur1c,This is only the food part of it. Looks to me like the venue gave this to a staff member to go to the store with and they thought it would be cool to post online. Theres a lot more technical and business stuff in the full thing,weirdal,d3nbmte,2,t5_2roy5
