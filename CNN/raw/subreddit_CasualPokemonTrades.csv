690667,0,t1_cgiqhcm,Ah gotcha well I havent had this problem myself exactly but this post from the thread above is the most likely issue  What I THINK is happening is that when nintendo is sending information to and from your dss it is sending information to a specific port. when you have both running at the same time the port in your router is being used and it isnt recognizing that the information is trying to be sent to a certain IP I KNOW that I had the exact same error code with my ds by itself. This is probably the problem that most people will come here for. What is happening there is that your router doesnt have nintendos ports set to allow and is blocking them. That is why you can access many other things on your ds or ds. What you have to do is either add nintendos neccesary ports to the allowed list or simply turn off the firewall within the router.List of ports here  I was able to fix the problem recreate at will and fix it at will so I can say with great certainty that this was the solution for my problem.Where are you accessing from? If you have access to the router check the settings. If not theres probably not much you can do but try deleting the ds wifi settings and reconfiguring them,CasualPokemonTrades,cgis4gq,1,t5_2zixh

2487610,0,t3_2o333g,The Torchic Treecko and Mudkip are all in illegal balls.Gen  and  starters can be in any generationusable ball thanks to the friend safari and the gen  starters are available in premiere repeat timer nest net dive and luxury balls thanks to colosseum on the gamecube.The other starters are only legal in pokeballs.For the future you can check serebiis list of possible pokeball combinations. Youll notice that some like Treecko Torchic and Mudkip are listed in balls besides the standard pokeball. But if you hover over them it says japanese link event. This event was genderlocked to males so the ball wasnt breedable.Additionally there have never been any pokemon with hidden abilities catchable in a place where you can use a safari ball sport ball or any of the apricorn balls. Fast level lure heavy love friend and moon So if you have something like a moon ball meowth thats legal unless it has its hidden ability which is unnerve.Edit Forgot to mention that your snorunt is legal in a dream ball.,CasualPokemonTrades,cmj9ovj,2,t5_2zixh

3177764,0,t3_2wgx6l,Woah I built my team based upon the  and below attack. Didnt know its going to be removed. Guess I have to rebuild my team from scratch and maybe alter some of it. By the way I actually found the  and below clause fun in a sense it made me think creatively and posed a challenge to build a team with a good movepool that touches that  damage line. I appreciate your willingness to conduct this tourney and I know you dont set the rules and such you just help organize it but in the future it would be much helpful if the rules dont get altered all of a sudden else some people will bring the wrong set of teams and itll all be a major confusion. Also all the persons effort might be just dumped.  Of course for those who can Pokegen this might not be a big issue. ,CasualPokemonTrades,cordgt6,1,t5_2zixh

When I was new a couple weeks ago what I did was I read the rules for rCasualPokemonTrades  rPokemonGiveaway  and rPokemonPlaza so that I would know which sub reedit to hit up depending on the kind of trade I was requesting. Give the rules a read itll clear up a lot of stuff lol And welcome to the community as well!!

When I genned some eevee eggs I found that mine wouldnt evolve into umbreon or espeon despite having max happiness and being levelled up and wouldnt evolve into Sylveon deespite having max affection and levelling up.

4918250,0,t1_cueguhh,When i was talking about loyalty I didnt mean you to him i meant people to their boards. No one wants to work together to try and build something better. It feels a little like Congress where everyone is partyloyal instead of community.   For the love of Pokemon am I right? I understand mods are unpaid I get that but why volunteer to do this if you dont want wont or cant put in the time and work? This is a big responsibility having that kind of title. Part of that is trying to improve upon the work that is being done. I say this not as a critique on him or you but as a point for the whole of internet moderators of course to date Ive only dealt with about a dozen exclusively on pokemon boards. But since mods dont get paid since there isnt any gain whatsoever why everyone is so oppsed to the goal of making the community better I have no idea.Im starting to believe Im the only one who thinks there is a problem. Is it pretty common that people only have one board and dont bother visiting the others? The only way any of this applies at all is if most people have one board and stick to it exclusively. I mean I go back and forth between all of them all the time and see there is so much overlap. Not to mention some are a lot harder to navigate than others. Each can serve a purpose. Why is efficiency not what were striving for? This isnt an attempt to push people around its an attempt to clean things up. Get a little bit of structure where its needed and less where its a pain. I mean if I only want to see competitive trades for example i should be able to go to a competitive board say pokemontrades and not have it littered with hacksclones and giveaways. I can see how it looks if someone puts a giveaway in the wrong spot it can be seen as pushing them away saying we dont do that here but its really more of In an effort to keep things simple X is done over on this other board. And I started out very nice and calm. I got hostile to him yes after he was mean to me. I was losing my patience I was tired of not being heard but I certainly didnt start it and I stopped. ,CasualPokemonTrades,cuehf5l,1,t5_2zixh

5213160,0,t3_3mel42,Unfortunately I dont have a legit event Mew. However I just want to say that I think its possible but improbable and I may be wrong that the shiny Mew is legit. Back in FRLG there was an event item that let you travel to an island where you could catch a Mew meaning it would have a nonevent OTID and since this was before shinylocking was introduced I think it could be shiny. You might want to check my info there but Im pretty sure thats right.EDIT Jk Cherish Ball was only introduced in Gen IV.

In my humble opinion thats incredibly lazy on your part. This site has a lot of people who would be very willing to help but you also have to be willing to help yourself.

9770057,0,t1_dahdddf,Yeah I had Pallosand on my team as well as vikavolt. The only problem is that most of these new mon have lack luster speed. So you really have to take advantage of the ones that do. Comfey and mimikyu are fun options that carry decent speed. Everything else on your team has a base speed below  right now so that would be a major concern for me considering none of them are necessarily tanks. Also the move sets can change all of that so without that information its hard to see where you might lack coverage. ,CasualPokemonTrades,dahdj5q,2,t5_2zixh

9823992,0,t3_5b4zu2,uSabershys ditto bot is goddamn amazing. Most people are understandably intimidated by the breeding ditto subs. Theyre very tight on submission rules which isnt a bad thing and is also completely understandable but on top of that they also close down a lot leaving the margin for error on a post very slim. A lot goes into getting a post right and it can be quite a letdown when you find that the effort you put into a post wasnt actually enough. I and others might not mind much but imagine what a waste of time it is for people who dont use reddit often andor are somewhat new. People like that have a harder time following what seem like a lot of simple rules especially if they dont have RES to use other posts as a guide which is likely the case for such users as well.Its great that they have those subs set up at all and obviously no one is entitled to their dittos but that doesnt mean people dont have good reason to be a somewhat upset about the fact that theyre not getting what they likely were encouraged by other starkly less rigid communities to come came there for.Bottom line A godsend for people who have breeding down to a science and newbies looking to try it out alike! A fantastic new avenue towards expanding the amount and quality of trades on the breeding scene. c And of course the whole thing is just really cool.,CasualPokemonTrades,dao34kv,5,t5_2zixh
