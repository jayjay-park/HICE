5183156,0,t3_3kz7jw,Hello While I cant really help you with parts I can at least guide you in the right direction.First not every mobocpu is compatible seeing as their sockets are different some CPUs are backwards compatible with older mobos but the mobos WILL need a bios updatewith few exceptions and all mobos are backwards compatible within the same chipset. For example You can put an old AMD sempron in a  AMAM socketnot reccomended purely because the sempron is a AM cpu.Seeing as you are strapped for cash I would suggest an AMD that has  cores for no more than  dont even think about streaming on a core especially if youre using DX that sucker uses two threads for gaming alone.I would suggest a  board to go with that cpu you can get them cheap as open box items on Newegg. Plus make sure the board has VRMs also stay the hell away from boards made from companies like Biostar unless youre looking to cash in on insurance money from a burned down house during the next thunderstorm. Micro ATX is good and cheap just dont expect XfireSLI unless you go for higher end MATX boards.Since you are going to be streaming and gaming GB of RAM would be ideal especially if you are streaming while playing coop good news is that RAM is at the lowest prices in over  years but is expected to go back up before the new year. Also for gaming purposes MHz is the mostminimum you really need.If you are really looking for cheap or free Hardware try rHardware Swap since gaming enthusiasts are updating their rigs so often they go there to sellgive away their stuff.Plus you have little to fear from being scammed as scammers are banned from all of reddit and they dont want that because they love rMasterRace. but what ever you do dont ask for handouts that is forbidden.PS Its nice to see someone else within a close area is part of an extralife team.,321,cvardje,1,t5_2s7u4
