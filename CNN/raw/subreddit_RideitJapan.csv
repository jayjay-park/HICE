2754734,0,t1_cnf3beu,I was all about riding by cc until I got the ticket.   Of course you can stay on smaller roads and get by fine I just kind of felt scared going slower than most of the cars on big roads.  I only got busted that once after years and years of riding though.  Often for hours a day so just watch out.  I had just updated the jets and the exhaust.  I had a scooter before that that i used to go to Kyoto and it accelerated much faster but didnt have as high a top speed as the Ape.  If you ever decided to upgrade the APE  engine will fit nicely in the frame.  I seriously thought about doing that but seemed like some work.  I think the roads going to Kyoto were comparatively small but Id imagine the sprawling metropolis of Tokyo would be much harder to navigate and move through.  Might be fun if you have the time though.    Otherwise Id just drive a car and take the ETC.  ,RideitJapan,cnh79j8,1,t5_2t9az
7996235,0,t1_d4esj1m,Oh of course! I dont want to sound reckless. I actually just spent  months in Japan and I met several people in a small town that I plan to go back to. I know I can get a feel for riding there without too much danger and I know people with experience there too. I definitely wouldnt attempt a long distance ride without serious practice first. I appreciate the comment!,RideitJapan,d4euppq,1,t5_2t9az
8294967,0,t1_d5ef4ty,As OP is a Dane their best bet is to convert their Danish automobile license to a Japanese license since that involves no tests and will still grant the ability to operate a ltcc scooter. This is doable without a registered residence if OP can get their embassy to vouch for an address of a hostel or hotel.,RideitJapan,d5efh7l,2,t5_2t9az
