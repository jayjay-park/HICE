247603,0,t3_1wxo19,Ok I have listened to a few of your mixes so far. I am kinda old school so keep that in mind. I have always thought that a mix was what you get when two or more songs are being played at the same time at the same bpm or half time or the like and was a way to seamlessly go from one song to the next. What I see and hear you doing doesnt really fit that description at all. Is this a new style of djing that is being practiced these days? Although I have done this kind of thing from time to time in a set I would never consider using it track after track. So I am curious is this what you are aiming for and if so do you try to bpm match at all?    ,mixes,cf6f19r,1,t5_2qipb

2452005,0,t1_cmerj04,Its a club which hosts electronic music artists. I like trance and house and have seen Markus Schulz Anjunabeats ATB Carl Cox there etc. Ive been there tons and openers always play house tech stuff. In the bottom room they usually play house techno or something like that. Its usually relatively dead with  ppl there. The top room is the primary room where acts play. Im sending my mix to get my first gig in the bottom room.Ive been DJing for about  months using a DDJSX. Ive been practicing on CDJs at guitar center and using Rekordbox as much as I can. I am not an expert but I think I can perform a basic mix on CDJs and DJM. I wouldnt be trying anything crazy yet though.I know a lot of new DJs ruin their chances by playing bangers early in the night or in opening sets. I like dancey funky house so I tried to make the set this way. What did you think of the tracks?,mixes,cmerrpr,1,t5_2qipb

3301912,0,t3_2xyhwi,First mix from intro into second song was out of sync a bit.  Also try to avoid huge bpm slowing could hear a pretty big one starting  might have been better served waiting for a build up and dropping on the .  There are also points that there seems to be some weird side chaining in which the kicks are overpowering and ducking the vocals I think its a Drake song not sure.  Im assuming from the fact that youre using Virtual DJ  its part of the song so not sure if theres anything you can about it Other than that keep it up its a fun hobby!,mixes,cp4n7rl,1,t5_2qipb

Really solid for a first mix.Little bit of key clash between Breakin A Sweat and Eat Sleep Rave Repeat.The change from a heavier kick drum to a light one feels a bit sudden at .Im kind of amazed that youre able to mix that smoothly using only the iPad controls.

5302539,0,t1_cvnno4n,Thanks for your feedback. I actually thought the same about the song selection as far as selecting classics instead of more obscure breakbeats. I went this route because it was my first breakbeats mix. However you are definitely right I think the next step is to create a mix without the hits. I will be recording more mixes and continue to post here. Thanks again! ,mixes,cvpgm3b,2,t5_2qipb

The transitions sounded on beatMy style is quite similar to yours in the fact I play almost any genre in whatever mix Ddepending on what you use for making mixes a good transition ive found for hopping between genres is the do a really slow brake on the track or loop it and then brake  once its about to end drop the next tunewill be good seeing more live mixes from you! and thanks for refollowing on mixcloud the  mixes up there are recorded liveunplanned  use the above trans alot,mixes,d5vqdri,2,t5_2qipb
