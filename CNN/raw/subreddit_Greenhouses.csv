Theres soooo many options and its fun to try things out. ,Greenhouses,ciwl0g2,1,t5_2qt1m
2545257,0,t3_2ov0g2,Im curious why youre considering antifreeze in a heating system at all. As long as the runs dont exceed manufacturers specs youll be fine.  Also I have a glycolwater heating system in the slab of my house. Glycol will find leaks water cant so if you use something similar you should do an especially good job looking before you bury anything. ,Greenhouses,cmqsvdo,2,t5_2qt1m

11040607,0,t3_5xdi94,Where do you live roughly?  In the northeast we have our tunnels going east to west.  So if its a x ft tunnel the ft long section is facing the south and the end walls are either on the east or west side.  This is the best way to maximize sun exposure specifically during the months of Oct  March.  ,Greenhouses,dejflzh,1,t5_2qt1m
