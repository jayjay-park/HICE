I know that it sounds odd but when it happens its not called an extra point. No team can win  it would be .Here is an example of it happening last year for reference.Oregon vs. Kansas State,theonlycolors,cli3d5n,1,t5_2wcz4

9984511,0,t1_db8wo8m,Hard to say for sure. There was a play on the drive where he broke his leg on the fourth down stop where he threw to Trishton Jackson but momentum carried him out of bounds. If he had managed to stay in bounds it wouldve been six. Assuming our defense stops them again all of a sudden Lewerke is leading a potential game winning drive instead of TOC driving for garbage points. Not saying we wouldve won by any meansbut it sure felt close in the fourth quarter.Ugh now I just relived that game ,theonlycolors,db90d98,3,t5_2wcz4
