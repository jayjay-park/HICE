I just ran Chenny off and on during the weekend and the  heroes in my team gained  levels.

As long as you dont need the hit its a great set. The pc isnt amazing though. It is far from bad as a set. If we could get multiples I probably would of spent every chocolate on them. Id honestly argue it are the best critfocused  star set. Royal Family Assassin uses bootsnecklace. Mad Guitarist requires being hit  times to match the other two sets. Id probably only trade mine for Beast Rain. Neph set is bad for sure though. Itd at least be decent if it was armor instead of boots.

I know a lot of people recommend Serendi for reducing incoming damage via Charm but I found that she didnt do enough damage to justify her spot. Once I dropped her for Kai I was able to do a lot more.Edit Having the HP Defense and Damage masteries in the Lord Battle tree really helped as well.

With your equipment potentials and equipmenttypes you automatically stack both therefore including high damage in a crit build either way.On the other hand healers or tanks should aim for a pure damage build.

Additionally disabled enemies gets the additional defense bonus from ending the turn without attackingIm not saying that moa is a great char though he can be on the right maps.

If you desire any of those costumes its best to grab them now. And of course there are also limited edition capsules avilable.

The only change is that dodge builds Technically the only hero that dodge builds are viable on is Dom? will have a little more damage due to the extra crit. For swords the best in slots will definitely change for people who need full swords like Jack.

7429410,0,t1_d2ma2tp,gtYES. This is what I find irritating... when I mentioned how grindy the game currently is and how a x speed option or autocomplete would be great people tell me that it is MEANT to be grindy and its a measure of player dedication.... and here I thought games were meant to be FUN and strategy games were meant to require strategy to win not just singleminded brute force grinding.Well yes and no. I understand why the grind is there to a point. But this games grind level is massive. And to me its a simple solution. Just allow us to do more than one run at a time. Let me do all  of a boss level. Before I could understand this may be hard because of the score screen. But they recently fixed this already by showing your total rewards at the end of a autospam. On top of that this would generate them slightly more money. It takes time to do a full energy bar for Lost Island or such. If youre trying to get it done letting me do  runs at once and using a potiongems sooner will mean Ill be doing that more since I wont be using the energy that generates in that time. For all I know this could be their goal in mind with the total rewards screen. On thing I have to give credit to this game for is that they are constantly giving QoL updates like this and wouldnt even be slightly surprised to see it someday. gtThe trouble is as a lot of people have noted the game lacks endgame content... people who have already reached endgame dont have much left to do. ... but... for those who havent reached endgame there is PLENTY to do. Also when you first start playing energy is truly overflowing you cant use it up faster than it regens with all the levelling up replenishing energy. ... All this is bad because it leads to stuff like this game getting Google Editors choice. Because its a great game all the way until you hit the endgame.While all true. Have to remember this is still a newer game. It is for sure an issue. I just hope they fix it before the game dies out because of it. I guess thats the core thing I hope they realize. Theyre on the clock to get this fixed before its too late. Edit Id say its fair to point out they is for sure taking too long. Weve been asking for something for a while. Theyve acknowledged it. But were working on sets and balance. Which I understand. I think the biggest issue was that Ashan was overall a flop. Autoing Lee and Angela wasnt too bad and finding a team comp to do it was fun. But the end stage was horrible. Everyone hated it. This is where your I thought games were meant to be FUN comment comes into play. This stage is not fun. Even if you have a good team to do it youre still at risk of getting RNGd to death from Gillan and Sonic. Not to mention the near requirement of a good Lee to auto Chaos.  gt... sometimes I feel that maybe this is all on purpose... once the big spenders have done their spending and built their sets up their spending is going to drop to near zero. ... and then they are no longer valuable to Nexon. ... so Nexon is PERFECTLY HAPPY for those fellas to all quit the game and bring in new potential big spenders who take a look at BoH top ranks and think to themselves Im gonna be in top  someday! ... how many crystals do I get for  again?I wouldnt go that far. But its not something they can really do something about. They cant really make content fast enough for the whales. Thats part of the point of being one. To give you an edge. At some point they will get bored. Even if they have good repeatable content since they can just buy their way back if they return later they dont really miss out on quitting for a while. Goal isnt really to keep up with the whales. Its to make it so everyone is still around when they whales come back. ,FantasyWarTactics,d2modam,1,t5_37xg2

7581328,0,t3_4j5hsr,Powercreep is an inevitability.  The problem that could arise here is with the fact that Krut is limited edition Ill agree with that.  However those may be the new S stats kk and in a few months Krut will be the rule not the exception.  The wall faced by new players wont be one of literally unbeatable heroes imo itll be of wanting to be in current content but having to levelprogress first.  Im sure itll be tough on new players but without progression leveling growth etc its really pointless.  Krut and Muz just provide people with excuses and things to whine about.  I cant do x because I dont have y limited hero! PvP is too hard because y is OP!!  Actually...people were doing x before y existed and kill az all the time in PvP with nony they just want it nownownow.  Theyd still get their faces melted against a gearedoutthewazoo Kai and its not like simply having a Krut or Muz allows people to auto Azrael or something.ampnbspKrut is going to provide an advantage...just like endgame heroes the farmiest of heroes just like other Lost Island heroes.  I dont feel like Krut is an endallbeall hero.  Heroes dont just become utterly useless because theres more powerful heroes otherwise I wouldnt be able to play the game at all because I dont have a Lee Chenny etc.  They arent impenetrable barriers upon creation that wreck game balance.  They require the same skilling leveling and gear as any other hero to be strong and can fall to the same skill gear tacticcheese on a base hero.Kite him CC him fight him just like you would any other powerful character.No one is forced to build to counter a hero...they just do because it makes sense.  Its the point of having a full roster with all available skills and tactical combinations.  Its sorta the core of fighting in any game.  Use the advantageous type.  And at times it becomes irrelevant like it can in other games.  Sure they get a damage plus multiplier or you dont have one from typeadvantage but if theyre locked down from CCdebuffed to all hell and cant hit you anyway...ampnbspThis sounds like the doomsday talk about Seira being the end of all rock teams forever unbalancing the game from exclusivity...yeah most of PvP is x rock teams so they dont seem too fazed.  Or Muzs exclusivity and damage being the end of scissors...yeah I still fight Chenny and Lee in half the battles most of which can  shot a rock so they must not have received the message that theyre useless.  I get the fear but...I just dont agree that its the end of all other heroes and whatnot.,FantasyWarTactics,d33ykgm,11,t5_37xg2

There are exceptions to the rule but Im curious as to what your reasoning for Alfred with OS set is.Your analysis is problematic because it ignores many variables and is treating a stochastic problem as if its deterministic. Counter damage relies on being attacked first whereas critical damage does not.  This makes it difficult for your argument to hold in BoH where first turns are randomized.  It is also somewhat biased because youre placing counter damage as the clear winner relative to critical damage for damage output in terms of counter attacks.

7861306,0,t1_d3zmbha,I left out Lord masteries so it is only  atk for me.But yes you are correct I forgot the  defense reduction on Dom but you forgot AtkByHP. So total atk with atk mastery is ..  .  .  .  Then after reduction .For Krut though this is what happens    attack.    .  .  .  .  Now the Question is where the extra  FSP comes in but since it is multiplicative as long as it is not in the bracket it doesnt matter where it goes to. We know that it doesnt go into the bracket because Nexon said that FSP I dont know where to find the quote though is the power after atk is multiplied. So it I just slapped it at the end and out came .Now why did I not choose  Necklaces over  Rings? It is because I think that  Rings is the more normal build. While I admit that no one builds it that way it is a much more effective build than  necklaces. Also I was too lazy to give everyone ideal equipment.So you think that  Necklaces will boost Jenny?

I think its fair to say that  for a no risk set especially one of this nature isnt AS bad.Considering that people have paid more and have not gotten at least full Daso or BR yet.Im also a budget spender so I know where youre coming from.  There is definitely a power creep and the disparity between fp and pp has become more and more apparent.  I have noticed that my growth in BoH has been stagnant relative to top players meaning the gap between us has stayed the same.  But there are also fp outliers with some luck making to the top.So going back to my point youre basically just paying to decrease risk in the game.

8347112,0,t1_d4upbwe,Floor ... WOW. Took me  tries easily and lots of RNG to be on my side before this turned out well.  My lineup Krut Serendi Jack Muzaka Lena w Krut merc. Basically followed the template that others set send Krut top serendi left jack bottom muz top lena hang out in the middle to immobilizeuse rd. You should really try your best to roll Confusion immunity on everyone but if not then at least Jack and Krut since they are key to this stage.  Having a jacked up Krut helps so much. He can draw aggro kill add ons immobilize and move over to grab the pots. My krut had K attack and  defense without passive buff.  Muzaka also needs to be pretty tanky himself to draw some aggro. Mine had the white knight set which gave him  aggro or something like that. It helped draw add ons and one boss his way long enough for my jack to distract them. I swapped my Jack out with a strong Krut merc on the first turn to clear the adds. Having Jack trapped next to two knights who can taunt him andor  fairies who can mess with his head via confusion is basically a death trap. You really need Jack to be freed up ASAP so he can start shredding the bosses.  I moved my serendi back to the middle platform after t urn  so she can heal the rest of my team. This was actually crucial for me since my serendi isnt strong enough to kill the add ons by herself like Reysons is anyway. So if yours isnt strong enough to two shot the knights experiment by moving her away to heal up others instead.  I got lucky on my run with Lena getting swapped by one of the fairies placing her next to the bottom left boss. With the hlep of grace and serendis heal Lena was able to basically solo one of the bosses. Luck and RNG is an absolutely HUGE factor on this stage. One confusion taunt or unlucky position swap can send your entire plan to smithereens. My best advice is to make sure your guys have as high enough defense as possible and just keep trying. This stage is really tough no doubt but the RNG is a huge part of it! ,FantasyWarTactics,d5kxxcb,1,t5_37xg2

9350359,0,t1_d9184tk,. ShopCaps  Really not much to say. It costs too much to get gear. Id be fine with a much larger drop rate and they return crystal costs to gear swapping. Problem is those who already have gear. Only good solution I can think of is giving transcendence hammers based on the sets they have or something along that line. Not sure how hard this would be though. At the least we need more reliability in our pulling. After whatever number of pulls of not getting an SSS set piece a gauge charges up. At  the next x pull will make your  set dropth pull that grade of set. ToD caps should also work as a charge system in this. Allowing you to mix crystals and pull caps for a x pull. Maybe up to a cap of  so you have to use at least some crystalsgame needs money after all. This would overall be a winwin as it encourages using crystals and lets people get a semix pull from ToD caps. . ShopAC  I really like the k gold per coin idea. Its such an easy fix. Id also like to see events here. Like using AC to buy other hero genes. Can be any heroNoblesse will probably be restricted from it at random. Limit will be based on the heros base gene cost. . ShopCostume  Another overpriced thing. Really should be halved. Other than the recent ones the quality of most costumes is not impressive. Also need more of them. Every release hero probably should of gotten a rd costume by now. Many dont. . ShopCrystalsGold  Meh overall. The  of crystals is overall fine depending on what youre spending them on. Gold cost is a bit high but I dont think its horrible. Its kind of a last resort shop. . ShopFunctional  Weve had some other things in here but overall theyve mostly been pointless. Would be nice to have a rotating event of things you can buy like mod pots diamonds even refinement stones. . Recommend  Wut? Kind of outdated really. . Guild Make checking in automatic for entering the guild screen.  Increase the cap to  members. For GR only the top  will count. Theres just too much pressure for everyone to play every single day. Sometimes we need a break without hurting the guild.  Leave Guild button is too damn big. Really the hell? It just looks important. Ive clicked it a few times accidentally. Good thing theres a warning pop up. . Guild Raid Rebalance rewards. This can be done through an achievement system or just spread them out a bit more.  Encourage raiding. Best way I can think of to do this is to give rewards based on the performance within a guild. If someone is in a top  guild and their a top scoring player. They should get rewards compareable to top  guilds to discourage guild hopping. Not trying to start anything here just leave it at that. This may cause issues of its own from bad guild management. But honestly youd probably see people leave said guild in that case.  Guild Skills  Why does Guild Protection not give mana? Sure its a strong skill in terms of defense. But its just not that amazing. Other than that upgrades would be nice.  Encounters  Rotate them. Something. Theyre stale. Can I possibly find new strats? Im sure I can. But Im bored to hell with what weve got. This is probably a  issue type thing. But this also gives other guilds a fresh start to try and be the next  guild if they can find the strats first and get ahead. It gives everyone a fresh start.  Soul Gear Summon Scroll Page  Please put away your hard on for currencies and remove this. We really dont need a middle ground from stones and scrolls. They do nothing but be the middle man.  Valk Genesalso AC genes now that I think about it  Gray them out when maxed. I assume BoH genes are also an issue with this.  Either a team for every day or at least a raid team separate from the normal  teams. Separate guild mercs from friend mercs. Half my friend list is Lee. . Equipment  Overall covered most of this with the Lab changes. Only thing I want to see here otherwise is a wardrobe saver to improve gear swapping. . Lord Menu  Revamp the battle menu. Lord skills are moved to the Lab. These will be replaced with HpMp regen in the first row. Gauge bonuses in the second rowlimited to one of the row. Such as gauge on crit on coop and on counter. With a limit per turn. Add more talents such as crit damage counter damage meleeranged specialization. Allow multiple trees for different areasWorld map PvP Raids.  Support menu is mostly moved to the Lab. All purchased points will be refunded.  battle mastery points will be available to buy for the same cost of maxing both trees. .  Heroes  Allow us to favorite heroes. As someone with only  heroes left to get to level including Hella getting to ValkYeka is a pain. Even worse are those in the middle as those at the end I can just swipe till it stops. These I actually have to search for. Its a common feature in games with many units. . Materials  Please remove the pointless units. That or make them useful for something. I get you want us to buy more space for materials. But you could do that just as easily by telling us the typing of a new hero more than  days before it comes out. People would of flooded their list with Paper Coocoos if they knew which one to get. . Achievements  Really needs some updates. . ContentsFriends  If my friend list is maxed out. Please dont put the red N up there when I have requests. Let me ignore them. . ContentsCollection  Overall a pointless list. I only use it to look at set stats in case I forgot something. . ContentsStoryCheck In Event  Fine as is. . Package  Fine as is overall. Although Id love a lifetime version of the Coocoos Gift. Id think a  one would be really good that is always activeyou can get both. It takes  months for the values to match. After that it works kind of like a thankyou for sticking around type thing. . Event Surplus Menu  Im sure Im not the only one who ends events with multiple thousands of event tokens. Usually burning all my gold with them just so they dont go to waste. Give us some things we can buy with these tokens for high prices. Like buying the daily shop stuff for x the cost. I think thats enough for now. I could get more into heroessets but this is probably enough. Edit I guess the numbers dont follow what you put but instead their own system. They look weird but Im too lazy to fix it right now. ,FantasyWarTactics,d9184zp,2,t5_37xg2

9372457,0,t1_d938t2h,Yup thats definitely cause he has  full sets whereas you have  full set and a  piece. A full set raises your combat power by a sizeable chunk. My Muz is in a similar position. I have  SS sets and  S sets on him but no  set. He has k combat power around abouts but far stronger than some k Muz Ive seen. Why? Because they just get like a straight up colossal boost in CP just by having  piece  set. Heck i equipped a full revelation set on my mostly ungeared unmodded jenny and that alone boosted her to like k CP. Yup a mostly ungeared unmodded k CP hero. Just by having a full A set. Side note Jack is shit. Muz self heals with passive and his free  set that you do happen to have not to mention that Jack only does decent damage on high HP enemies THAT ARENT IMMUNE TO HP DAMAGE. Most enemies where that is significant now have hp damage immunity anyway so Jack ends up being useless. Plus his other skills dont matter either theyre just plain bad.

Its hard to give a suggestion because i dont know your intention of maxing them do you plan to use them for BoH? Or youre just maxing them for the sake of maxing them? I would prioritize Deimos for BoH if youre only using him for guild raid then you dont need his skills to be maxed. As for Celestial and Valk I would suggest you to farm their genes instead of using P.Genes on them. Spooky and Banshee will depend on whether youre using them for Battle of Honor i dont think there are any guild raid strats that utilizes them.

Continue with Bearman as he has other uses outside of backup stunner with Mu.I would agree that continuing gear upmod up til you can do some version of the long alternative strategy  if the sets you mentioned especially daso and Angel knight were fully upgraded modded near perfectly and transcended hammered out  then you could look at some version of the turn and burn strat but youre way off from that stat point so focus on getting your hellfires to do  of the work for you.,FantasyWarTactics,da99ct6,2,t5_37xg2

9912394,0,t1_dazeo2h,See below picture. Things to note. This is not the optimal start this is a good one if you need to use a Muz merc.Lilly must have no armors you want her to die after her st push.You must use Combat Support to cleanse the immobilize on Muz at the beginning of your nd turn so that he can move to side of boss.This strat should trap the boss on the tile on far left.  The Mas image on the tile in the bottom corner can be a Cleo if you need help with crit. Your lee needs to be able to take  hit from the boss without dying.Again this is not the optimal strat it uses Muz merc and is rather lower level user friendly. Ideally your Gillian is healing Krut and Muz and your lee is in position to get the buff activating his passive. Mas gives you double support bonus and his passive buffs your attack.,FantasyWarTactics,dazlwmc,1,t5_37xg2

10139592,0,t3_5l5lje,First of all thanks for the tier list!One more column for gr tier would be nice but I understand that gr tiers can change really fast.If you ordered the list by pvp Krut should be at least under Belle. His boh performance really suffers because of sk and paper meta.Lee Rai and Sione I think do not deserve to be pink tier. Their hitboxes are unimpressive they are really easy to kill and they are attack type. The only advantage is the  tile snipe and Rais mp burn but I still think thats not enough.The twins on the other hand perform extremely well in boh especially in the current meta. Banshee has an important advantage of being the only scissor dps thats not oneshot by Krut. Shes great to deal with all the Cels and Valks.Raboff deserves at least A grade in boh for his ability to deal with Belles. Definitely more scary than Ragna or Rage. He should also be at least S in tod as the only  turns disarmer.Evan is good in pve but not S good because of his huge mp cost. NonKrut dps that perform best in WC should be able to use rd at least  times in a row which Evan cant do. His rd range is also unimpressive. On the other hand I think you are underestimating him in tod. Hes not best at anything but having huge stun confusion and long range all on one hero is extremely useful even though his mp regen is pathetic.Finally I think Nirvana deserves S in tod for his huge buff on rd and huge debuff on nd.,FantasyWarTactics,dbt6ysk,1,t5_37xg2

Would appreciate if someone can provide me solid advice on what I should do. I also have no idea on which heroes amp  what team I should focus on. Ive been just reading stuffs in reddit and forum to gather my knowledge but Im quite overwhelmed as to I have no clue where or who to ask. My guildie never talks as I just join a random guild to get Valkyrie and her genesoul pieces. I have farmed up hardcore enough for Banshee amp Spooky genes so i think I would like to use the twins xDampnbspThis is all my heroes and their equipmentsIve been doing ToD up till floor  or  I forgot. Almost have full genes for Banshee. And as for chocolate event I have bought these following items  Enough genes to get spooky Trans hammers Gillan Costume Sweet and Scary Chocolate WarriorWhat should I get next from chocolate event? In my mind I was thinking of Slick Pen Set gt Max Spooky genes gt Spooky Set gt Their costumes? But this is highly unlikely Ill at most be able to get Slick Pen Set  k ish Spooky genes ampnbspThings that I do everyday Library in the Sky stage  amp  up till floor  for that creamy  blue gems per day. Will get her in  more days woo hoo xD x Guild Raid no clue why I should do it but I just did.. no energy cost so why not lol Lost Islands Banshee probably will be replaced with gene farming for jack serendi gillan deborah mas Auto highest SS normal stage I can for Exp and Gold BoH whenever its up yay Belle Expedition DB till stage  depending on the opponents team amp RNGBefore Lost Islands Banshee I was farming Jacks Serendi and Gillans gene but I stopped because i spent all my energy into farming Banshee....ampnbspAlso for these heroes what order should I Max their skill? Based on research and a lot of googling this is what I found out Jack  gt Passive gt  gt  Deborah  gt  gt  gt Passive Serendi  gt  gt gt Passive Valkyrie Passive gt  gt  gt  Celestial not found Mu   gt  gt  gt Passive Gillan not foundThanks in advance for taking your time reading  ,FantasyWarTactics,ddxrrfn,1,t5_37xg2

She can one shot almost anything. Even paper tanks. Probably only hero with nothing to worry about is Eunwol if his passive is up. Frank would be A instead of B for ToD. There are bosses that he does make easier to deal with. Fruel should be a Yes for Thursday. His wings makes his coops really strong.

As such my advice is never mod vanilla gear get two good orange mods on platinum gear of one to three stars three good orange mods on platinum gear of four or five stars and all good mods on set gear.Dont worry about WC WC will take care of itself.
