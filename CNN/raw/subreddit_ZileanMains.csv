5950378,0,t3_3ogksi,First of all your name is amazing.Anyway I dont have much time right now but as a Diamond Zilean main with over  games Ill try to give some quick basic answers. Zilean should always max W second.  Generally QgtWgtE.  If you wanted to go a pure speedutility build you could try EgtWgtQ.  But you should never max Q and E both before W.  I have a thread with the long explanation if youre interested. Assuming youre not in the LCS with guaranteed blue buffs Zilean NEEDS a flat mana item  Mana font.  So Tear  Athenes or RoA  Athenes is good.  Anything else falls short.  The difference between Morellos and Athenes here is the difference between a good amount of mana and virtually infinite mana. You should definitely be reaching  CDR every game and before level .  Scaling CDR runes arent optimal because even with his passive most games dont have you reaching level . Ideally you wantx flat CDR glyphs  .x flat CDR Quint  .Athenes Unholy Grail  Ionian Boots of Lucidity  For a total of  after your Athenes  Lucidity boots.  Bonus points if you use the mastery to reach  CDR.  Its amazing on him.  More on that in my thread.Hope I helped!  Try adjusting to these things and given how experienced you already seem youll probably notice a huge spike in performance when playing Zilean.  Especially if youre switching to the QgtWgtE max!,ZileanMains,cxzmhvz,1,t5_39cwu

7604717,0,t1_d36kr0h,Thx! You play a lot less on my main account since soon days i was working to work on my new main i have to play ranked before may st or ill decay i keep playing on my other account silver  until i get better with those CS. Im really nuts with the AA last hit now but i tend to do poor choices sometimes with my bombs in my csing managment. That really gets me upset when i lose  cs because i set poorly one bomb. Once ill get it ill go back and try to climb on my main.,ZileanMains,d36m7w8,1,t5_39cwu
7881761,0,t3_4n5621,A couple of months back I made a thread with a similar question and had asked for some Ideas for skins to be made. Feel free to check them out as they are some amazing ones that I really want made ,ZileanMains,d41zeu0,1,t5_39cwu

8090396,0,t3_4q10xc,It depends on the ADC. Lucian or Ashe for instance powerspikes hard at level . Midgame its often given preferably to people about to hit  otherwise leveldependent people like mid and sometimes jungletop. ,ZileanMains,d4pfnbf,1,t5_39cwu

10798240,0,t1_ddtdms6,Nah I think  Dorans in the early is the best cause u need RoA and  cdr as fast as possible.,ZileanMains,ddtreya,1,t5_39cwu
10931898,0,t1_de7ed87,It isnt lifesteal its a regen buff over  seconds thus attack speed wouldnt factor into an amount of healing but rather the just the duration of the buff.,ZileanMains,de7jqwg,2,t5_39cwu
