1058702,0,t1_chokzwo,Ill admit to partisanship  but as a Canadian. And it gets confusing up here. I could vote straightup Conservative and still be slightly to the left of the Democrats on many issues. So Im going to just leave that there and state flatout that my view of the current GOP is not particularly partisan  I tend to be something of an ReflexiveConservative with distinct Libertarian influences and if they were capable of governing and coming up with coherent policies that were not blatantly stupid religiouslybased or racist often all at once Id probably be listening. Its rather hard to be in favor of the democratic party  at the moment its mostly that they are NOT republicans. And thats all they really need to be.That is because the GOP has become incapable of governing. Consider the Idaho primary so gleefully highlighted in all media. How partisan do you have to be to notice that two of the four candidates that made it to the official debate this meant that they were able to collect signatures and get on the ballot  were raving loons?Thats an incompetent party. It cannot govern. It cannot and obviously has not articulate or propose policies that make any goddamn sense. This is not a partisanship problem. Eisenhower had no problems governing. Barry Goldwater had a platform that made sense. Nixon was a brilliant policy wonk whatever else you might say about him. Bush the First was scary smart and a better president than EITHER party is comfortable admitting. This goes to competence. Not politics. Competence.And yes you are correct  its often useful for a politician to lie. Its better generally if they do not lie because you can get caught out that way. Its better to say nothing at great length  Ill cite Bill Clinton as an example of that. Clinton can actually say things too so thats even better. But thats not the only skill. You have to be social you have to try and alienate as few people as possible and you need to be able to compromise somewhat. MOST importantly you cannot be too far from where the majority of people are now and even more importantly where they will be in one or two election cycles.I mean.. thats just basic. If you want to be part of a functioning representative democracy thats what you need to do. Of course if you want to win regardless of popular opinion or common sense  theres another path that is popular  some sort of corrupt oligarchy with aspects of a police state. Long popular in South America such approaches really dont serve many people very well and it tends to lead to a lot of politics by other means.I see that as a bad thing and that being willing to risk such a state is something that speaks to competence.However if you really do prefer a totalitarian religious dictatorship to a functioning republic  you would not be alone.  But I dont see objecting to that to be a political opinion. I see it as akin to objecting to rabies.,inthenews,chomncd,4,t5_2rgzp

There is precedent for this in  Ecuador declared  of its debt illegitimate.I dont get this.

Investing is only possible when a person has surplus wealth. I doubt anyone but a young person sharing housing with a few others will have anything left over from hour.. The big problem with the minimum wage is that there are simply not enough jobs for all the available workers. And this is going to get worse as worker productivity continues its steady climb while a fairly new generation of robotic of automation is poised to take over huge swaths of thinking jobs like driving vehicles. . There is something intrinsic in human nature that allows elites to ignore inconvenient aspects of reality. There is a whole other type of person who seems to be genetically constructed to be an unthinking supporter of the status quo.

At some point M Brown turned around to face the officer circumstantial evidence puts his body at some  feet away from Officer Williams.  shots were fired ? hit M Brown killing him. I have not seen any nonanecdotal evidence that Officer Williams fought with or was injured by Brown.So the summary is that an unarmed black male was stopped and subsequently killed by police for no reason at all.

Source material for estimations can be manipulated in many ways for example changing definitions of rape sexually assault etc.  Also when you look at rape male underreporting is a significant obstacle to understanding how extent the problem is.  Fraud rates are very low because identification of fraud is resource intensive.  Just like male rape a lack of data does not mean fraud isnt occurring.  What is more likely we simply dont know to what extent fraud is happening.  Only the low hanging fruit are being prosecuted.  These are the cases that are so overthetop that the prosecutors cant ignore them.If voter fraud is rarely detected and even more rarely prosecuted what is the disincentive for committing this act?Yes the President was making a tongueincheek joke about what many Chicagoans consider to be a historical fact.  It was illadvised but not a fatal faux pax.  The bigger point is that he acknowledged what many local regional and national citizens believe.

In a government department related to trade negotiations?Let me start by saying clearly that like all technology GM engineering can produce things that are safe and things that are unsafe even dangerous even very dangerous.  There is no basic safety there is no basic danger in GME.  It is vacuous to say that GMOs are inherently safe or unsafe.The case against GMOs is simple enough.  Ownership of patents of genes means there is a lot of money involved.  With that sort of money at stake companies will do a lot to maintain ownership.  They will for instance lobby governments to relieve them of reasonable safety standards.  They will insist on large prices for genetic tests for things like genes for breast cancer.  They will lobby governments to put pressure on other governments to allow GM crops.  So far GM crops have not really shown many or even any real benefits over traditional breeding programs.  GM crop companies have tried to monopolise the markets in seeds in various ways from buying out other companies to litigation based on patent rights.As in the pharmaceutical industry scientific testing funded by the companies who own the patent rights over the organisms being tested are tainted by the funding.  The only real way we can be sure of the safety of GMOs is if the safety studies are done by disinterested scientists not funded by corporations.,inthenews,co7f35k,-2,t5_2rgzp

Before I get to Michele Bachmann I want to just  youre a physician Ron Paul so youre a doctor.  You know something about this subject.  Let me ask you this hypothetical question.A healthy yearold young man has a good job makes a good living but decides you know what?  Im not going to spend  or  a month for health insurance because Im healthy I dont need it.  But something terrible happens all of a sudden he needs it.Whos going to pay if he goes into a coma for example?  Who pays for that?PAUL  Well in a society that you accept welfarism and socialism he expects the government to take care of him.BLITZER  Well what do you want?PAUL  But what he should do is whatever he wants to do and assume responsibility for himself.  My advice to him would have a major medical policy but not be forced BLITZER  But he doesnt have that.  He doesnt have it and he needs intensive care for six months.  Who pays?PAUL  Thats what freedom is all about taking your own risks. This whole idea that you have to prepare and take care of everybody APPLAUSEBLITZER  But Congressman are you saying that society should just let him die?PAUL  No.  I practiced medicine before we had Medicaid in the early s when I got out of medical school.  I practiced at Santa Rosa Hospital in San Antonio  and the churches took care of them.  We never turned anybody away from the hospitals.APPLAUSEPAUL  And weve given up on this whole concept that we might take care of ourselves and assume responsibility for ourselves.  Our neighbors our friends our churches would do it.  This whole idea thats the reason the cost is so high.The cost is so high because they dump it on the government it becomes a bureaucracy.  It becomes special interests.  It kowtows to the insurance companies and the drug companies and then on top of that you have the inflation.  The inflation devalues the dollar we have lack of competition.Theres no competition in medicine.  Everybody is protected by licensing.  And we should actually legalize alternative health care allow people to practice what they want.So its lovely that he pays lip service to not letting people die describing hospitals and churches of the distant past helping the poor but everything he said in context previous to that would make that completely untrue.Back to the point though.gtPAUL  Well in a society that you accept welfarism and socialism he expects the government to take care of him.gtBLITZER  Well what do you want?gtPAUL  But what he should do is whatever he wants to do and assume responsibility for himself.  My advice to him would have a major medical policy but not be forced gtBLITZER  But he doesnt have that.  He doesnt have it and he needs intensive care for six months.  Who pays?PAUL  Thats what freedom is all about taking your own risks.So take your own risks means the hospital will treat you for free but if the hospital treats you for free who pays for it? The welfarism and socialism? If he meant ask for donations on GoFundMe how is that assuming responsibility for himself?,inthenews,cp0nbvq,3,t5_2rgzp

So it works both ways. This guy absolutely is a moron you dont need to sign onto Obamacare in order to have insurance. Im against the ACA Im against most if not all government meddling within the health care market and because of this I made sure I have insurance. I also have a preexisting medical condition one of the benefits of the morons that support the ACA is that I get to benefit from it. But I know in the long run the health care system will be worse off because of the ACA and all the regulations mandates and taxes that will be in our future.  ,inthenews,cp0xazt,1,t5_2rgzp

I cant really think of any wars in my lifetime that were presented as for peace but could easily be linked to someone making a big chunk of money or at the very least to justify a huge military budget. Thats a budget so large that every single American if split evenly could have free medical or food or whatever really it would go a long way toward fixing our infrastructure getting rid of homeless problems and a number of other large problems all over the united states.

Kohlberg followed the development of moral judgment far beyond the ages studied earlier by Piaget  who also claimed that logic and morality develop through constructive stages.  Expanding on Piagets work Kohlberg determined that the process of moral development was principally concerned with justice and that it continued throughout the individuals lifetime  a notion that spawned dialogue on the philosophical implications of such research.  gtThe six stages of moral development are grouped into three levels preconventional morality conventional morality and postconventional morality.gtgtImage iInteresting James W.

3657358,0,t1_cq955oc,That sounds fishy.  Most cars Ive driven havent been new enough to have that fifth light.  There may be some law in your state about if you car has it then it must work but they cant just go around ticketing older cars.  I know in my state youre required to have two mirrors and one of them must be the driverside mirror.  The other can be passengerside or overhead.I think he was looking for an excuse.  Some cops honestly dont know what the traffic laws are and write all kinds of silly tickets that get thrown out in court.  IANAL YMMVHaving one taillight out could be a really big deal.  It very rarely is but it could be.Lets say the light thats burned out is a breaklight.  No biggie.  Youve got another one  or do you?  It could go out at any time and how would you know?  You break for a cardoor and the vehicle behind you plows into you.  Is it likely to happen?  Nope.  But it is still worth getting a stern safety warning to have it fixed.  this may be one reason for newer vehicles to add that fifth lightOk then lets say its not a breaklight but one of the other taillights.  You might be driving during daylight hours or on welllit city roads.  You might not be later tonight.  And if that second light goes out you might be invisible to a speeding teen.  You probably dont drive with your foot on the break rendering the other lights irrelevant.I see no reason to punish people for it if they correct the issue.  I do see it as a legitimate stop.The  I paid was probably too high for a fixit though I did know I had a problem and am not complaining.  Taillights though?

4492010,0,t1_cswuf3e,You know I tried to let this drop but I am fascinated by your thinking. Perhaps in a morbid way. Lets say you have two choices which you do. Act or not act.  Assume he is not going to shoot you and rape your wife or kill the both of you and dont take action stopping the intruder.  if you are wrong you both die or worse your wife suffers horribly and perhaps even dies later.  if your are right you and your family and future offspring and society as a whole are better off.  Assume he is going to shoot you and rape your wife and go ahead and take action. If you are right you stand the chance of you your wife or all of you dying in the fight.  You also stand the chance of anything happening from nobody dying in the fight to only the predator dying in the fight. In that case you and society win.I guess what it comes down to is your training and confidence in that and also the specific situation at hand. And also whether you are willing to risk your life for others or risk others lives for yours. Im the type that would rather die getting shot in the face by an intruder while trying to strangle him to death than to die kneeling on the ground execution style. I think most cops are the same way. And why is it that you seem to think a citizen protecting himself is a cowboy. Do you see cops as heros? We are all humans after all. I may have more training than some cops. Why am I the cowboy?

I had never had one until I got my EMT license and I dont think my daughter has had one in her childhood vaccine batteries. Also lets not pretend there are no negative consequences to vaccines its just that the negative results are so outweighed by the sheer mass of lives we are saving and improving that it is ridiculous not to do it. The antivaxxers are only anti because they sit in this peaceful harbor we have created through the use of vaccines. They have never seen the full fury of nature at sea  so to speak and therefore dont know how lucky they are that they even exist to curse that which saved them. BTW last night was not the first time I have heard competent doctors suggest it would be better if we spread out the battery by a few months. ,inthenews,cv5dpwi,2,t5_2rgzp

No kid is responsible enough to handle butane or any of the other materials that are used to refine marijuana oil.  I am not even sure if refining oil is legal in WA for adults.  Also obviously these kids were selling this shit.  There is absolutely no reason to have more than an ounce of weed as long as you arent refining growing or selling.  None of these are things that kids should be doing!  Lets be honest here its hard for me to scrape together the  or so that I will need to buy an ounce where I am at.

I was encouraged by my college officials not to go to the police because rarely are these things actually dealt with. Rape kits dont get tested very often and often things turn into he said she said. So I can understand saying something on twitter because even if she didnt go forward theres a terrifying stigma about going forward. I can understand posting about it because she consistently has to see her rapist being idolized.  I know Ive wanted to post about the guy who sexually harassed me and tried to get me to kill myselfeveryone loves him and thinks he is great and it just disgusts me and makes me feel even more helpless.Thats what rape and such does it makes a person feel helpless. Maybe this is her way of trying to not feel so helpless and to bring some light to what he has done.Edit okay why is this getting downvoted?

Its also in a funny dialect that the vast vast majority of Muslims dont read write speak or understand and in any other language than that one form of Arabic its not the Quran anymore.  All of that makes it really difficult to come up with a direct and natural interpretation.  Its not like you can sit down with the text and make form your opinions the way you could with the King James Bible or Book of Mormon or something like that.  It takes lots of training and education just to learn the dialect and by that point any interpretation isnt going to just flow out its going to be the product of the educational process that got you to Quranic literacy in the first place.And this process of educating and interpreting and unpacking a convoluted text and tradition has been a big part of Islamic history with different schools of thought and jurisprudence arriving at different conclusions as to whats Islamic whats within the bounds of Sharia what the Quran is really saying etc.Violence has been a major theme of Islamic history and its certainly a major theme of the Quran.  But it doesnt strike me as any more inherently violent than Judaism.  One thing that stands out to me is the form that Islamic violence has taken through history.  What were seeing now even from supposed reactionaries like ISIS is a departure from historical precedent and accepted Muslim teachings on warfare and acceptable violence.Whats odd to me is that you claim theres no way to interpret the Quran any other way than being demanding of violence yet there are millions upon millions of Muslims with just such an interpretation.,inthenews,cy84gff,1,t5_2rgzp

So they formed a new party called the Confederates and decided they would secede from the union and start their own country if Lincoln forced them to comply with the law.

7197832,0,t1_d1ttlcu,gt I do too.No you dont.  You believe in robbing someone and then providing some alleged benefit to them and calling that moral.  The idea behind this is basically positive externalities yet there is not link to the positive externalities.  I could make the same thing in Flint as Seattle and my rate is the same federally and reasonably similar on the state level which actually funds most of those things.  If you really want to look into this look into georgism which isnt linked to personal value creation but to these externalities but it is a longer path than this conversation might last.gtbecause to you their wealth must mean that they are more hardworking or more responsible and have earned the right to take advantage of things like tax loopholes even if it hurts poor and middle class people.No they produce value though.  Value isnt the same as work.  Some work is inefficient.  Some may be harder working some may not.  The production of value creates wealth.  I can create a million rocks and have nothing for it.  If I produce some with gold bingo.  Same work different result of value.  gt However you also believe that standing up for your own self interest or even the interests of other middle class and poorer people is somehow immoral and selfish.You arent standing up for yourself you are robbing others of value.gtIt is part of human nature for people to look after the interests of themselves and people like them.It was for many years natural to kill people traveling the roads or to enslave them.  We bacame more civilized over time and that is considered not ok...well sort of today.gtDenying yourself that right while giving the wealthy a free pass to be selfish and greedy is ridiculous. This mentality allows a very small minority of the population to take advantage of the vast majority of people and ultimately it hurts society a lot more than it helps.And this is why I say you dont believe in some morality.  Im sorry if you find it rude but there are greater masses of population than the US.  You are immensely rich compared to most of them.  Should they now rob you.  You feel it is happening and that is where this anger is from.Well in a sense they are...  Free trade agreements while appropriately none of those things free trade or agreements improve this in the right direction.  Hundreds of millions are coming out of poverty.  Those of us at the high end of the global classes for labor but not creating production are toast until everyone else catches up because we sell labor and thats it.  It has mediocre value.  We can block them off but we are just moving our labor sales into a haven.  Welcome to the otherside of the perception.  So there is no moral here outside of hedonism.

Solutions  The classical leftist solution Torch expensive cars. Gets put into the crime statistic hopeefully prevents hipsters from moving theere. . The planning solution Simply move the homeless people and such into the AirBnB areas and pay them well to raise some hell. In the same time leave horror stories about airBnB stays. . The more valuee approach Drop a tourist pass. let it cost like  bucks allready pre payd for hospital visitors but allows you like free entry into musees and such. Basically offer more value for the same price. But if you hhave an inner city where agents say Well the rent may be a bit high but if you rent it out over airBnB you can afford it if not we have full aiting lists of people who will you have to decide What does the inner city prefer? Tourists en masse and no more space for the locals? Gentrification of entire blocks by subrenting top tourists?Or affordable housing? I  personally find the berlin compromise very nice. If you want trouble in berlin it is a gentlemans agreement that if you are local and can proove it you try to keep the troublee away from other locals.

Heck doctors are banned from asking patients if they have a gun in the home even if they are suffering from depression or suicidal risk. They cant even ask a question that might save their patients life because someone is afraid that they might be told that having a gun increases the chances of a suicide attempt!Your way would be like not passing laws to charge DUI simply because we have an alcoholism problem in this country.

By comparison outside of diamond mining arms trade and propping up the eternal warzone we arent as invested in Africa. As for the ego crutch comment Im right. Religion in general serves to provide people with the egodefensive mechanisms to carry on with their lives without descending into existential crisis constantly. We just dont like the fact that we are objectively utterly insignificant when viewed in the context of the scale of the universe. You could quite literally eradicate every man woman and child on the face of the earth and the universe would not blink. Because it wouldnt notice we were gone. The role of deities is to convince people that they matter in some respect. It assure them that they have some place in the universe and something actually cares about them. It gives them meaning which a lot of people need. This has been studied for time immemorial from the Ancient Greeks to Nietzsche to Jung and onwards. My point was not necessarily in order to denigrate  because an objective fact of the human psyche is difficult to cast any particular judgement on given its general universality and the reasons for it. But I am right it is a crutch. With respect to human form and JudeoChristian mythos Im comparing it to the no idols part of Islam the many varied gods of Indian faiths many of which at least diverge from the human to some extent and other totemic faiths animal inspired deities of the Inca Aztecs and native Americans etc. The Christian representation of God is just a guy and the reason given is that were created in Gods image. Thats one reason why it worked so well If Im a peasant and I dont have much in the world and not much hope in the future suddenly Christianity is telling me that A I resemble something divine. B I have potential to benefit from my otherwise shitty circumstances which I am unable to change. C I have a place in the universe and theres a cosmic force that I can comprehend that cares about me thinks Im special and consider me on equal terms with kings and emperors.

Mind you Im not saying Russia is not a threat only that the evidence implicating their involvement and impact in this current fiasco is so scant and the upside for the Democrats so clear that it looks more like propaganda.
