267912,0,t3_1x5i6c,Have you looked over the curriculum and exams for AP English? Does it seem like something you can and want to do? If the answer is yes then I would strongly recommend attending an AP workshop. Your school would probably pay for it. The workshops can be extremely beneficial if you get a good presenter. They show you how the course is structured set you up with some unit and lesson plans and help you understand the exam and how to prepare students for it. If youre teaching AP then you have to follow the AP curriculum. I think most teachers would normally be expected to create their own lesson plans and likely a syllabus that the College Board must approve. I think any training and preparation is better than none at all. No certification program can teach you everything but it will make things easier for you and better for your students if you come in with some training. ,TEFL,cf8j260,1,t5_2qq76

Is he taught by anyone else? How is he with them?Is his behavior...strikingly abnormal or is he just spoiled or immature? Ive taught at a school with lots of difficult pampered rich kids and one kid who turned out to have a history of abuse and mental illness. As Im sure you know you have to approach things that are off the spectrum of normal disruptive behaviors differently. gtNow when he goes on his tantrums I ask the TA to take him out of the class but he doesnt even listen to the TA.Well shit. Thats a bit extreme for a sevenyearold. At this point Id be documenting the fuck out of everything. Get the parents email and email the your supervisorthe parents every time he acts up. This is not only to keep people informed but you later pull this up and show that youve tried different strategies its a continuing problem etc. Whats managements take on this? Im guessing theyll take anyone who pays because management but if a student is disrupting the learning of other paying customers they might be concerned. Id say at this point if hes disrupting the class and not listening to teachers he needs serious sanctions from on high. This cant go on. James sounds like a smart kid he probably wouldnt be pulling this crap if he hadnt gotten away with it before. Perhaps you and someone in management can have a talk with the parents and James.

1488274,0,t1_cj0lss3, Im actually from Croatia so English is a foreign language here so by default any teaching here is automatically teaching somebody a second language. Im aware of the textbooks of course but the best part of the games is that you can change them to fit anything you need to teach all you need is enough creativity. This is where Ill have to disagree with you. Teaching somebody to play a PnPRPG is as simple as reminding them to imagine. Ive had a couple of years of experience teaching Pathfinder a game largely based on the Dungeons and Dragons games and with quite a bit of success and I can proudly say that I dont think any of them read the rulebook at all. Pretty much everything can be pickup up as you play. When a player wants to do something ingame you simply tell them what theyre supposed to do. In general when it comes to this kind of games you dont want the rules to get in the way of the storyline the players and whoever is acting as the game masterdungeon masterstoryteller are creating.The very first idea that comes to mind when it comes to having learners learn certain linguistic rules would be thisHave the learners ingame research some ancient long forgotten language. The language is in fact English and whatever clues they pick up on the language they should use within the game to solve puzzles grant them certain bonuses and help them in any way. This combined with keeping the game Englishonly possible first language use only when discussing things that need to be explained clearly or for vocabulary purposes could make things a lot more interesting than simply writing down rules to be memorized later. This is of course just something that came to mind and would have to be carefully built upon. Implementing grammar shouldnt be too hard as long as whoever is creating the game environment is aware of what the learners are supposed to be learning. All those worksheets could easily be implemented into the game environment as long as they are given context. First of all as harshael has mentioned RPGs utilize a lot more than just fantasy. I understand where this confusion is usually coming from. Dungeons and dragons is usually the first and only PnPRPG people hear about and this causes them to automatically connect it to the phrase PnPRPG itself. The shortest explanation would be that every DampD game is a PnPRPG but not every PnPRPG is DampD. There are many RPGs and they differ in rulesets and settings. The best part is you can actually easily create your own that would suit your needs in the classroom. Regarding your note on vocabulary heres a short description of an adventure we played just a few days agoA Pathfinder leading a diplomatic envoy from the dwarven holds of the Five Kings Mountains has gone missing and the balance of power in a time of war hangs on her rescue. The Pathfinder Societys divinations indicate the agent was waylaid in the theocratic nation of Razmiran when one of her escorted diplomats failed to pay a requested tithe. Now it falls to the party to enter Razmiran locate the missing Pathfinder and the dwarven diplomats and escape with their lives.Diplomatic envoy hold balance of power waylaid theocracy escort tithe. And this was just from the brief description. This was of course from a fantasy setting but thats just because thats something me and my friends prefer playing. Dont forget that regardless of the setting the learners will still be speaking not just using specific words. They will still be describing asking retelling communicating and explaining. Besides words like ogre do present some interesting points when it comes to phonetics  Also remember that idioms phrases proverbs are also part of a language and RPGs are chock full of those.  The most important thing here is that PnPRPGs are extremelly flexible and anything can be added as well as removed. The goal is to have the learners use the language theyre learning while still having them interested. If you think the class wont be interested in fantasy try contemporary horror if theyre old enough for it! Or simple fairy tale settings for the younger ones. Why just retell Little Red Riding Hood if they can be a crucial part of it?  If the game is well thought out you wont need to remind them of linguistic rules often. Simply think of a game mechanic that would force them to repeat until they get it right. Also if one of the students doesnt get it right chances are another one will help out. Usually the goal in these games is cooperation and often it builds team skills. Dont explain the rules. Just start playing. It might sound counter intuitive but it works. When it comes to PnPRPGs rules sound daunting. This isnt a boardgame where you need everyone to know the rules so theres no cheating. This is hard to explain to someone who never played a similar game but there is no victory per se in a PnPRPG in the end its all about telling a story and living it out through the characters. Ive done it this way dozens of times and trust me it works. Dont talk about the rules as such simply when someone tells you heshe would like their character to do something you tell them what they need to do to do it. No dumbing down needed. If any rule seems to restrictive doesnt make sense has to be explained too much in depth disregard it or change it. PnPRPG rules are often just guidelines and as such are subject to change. Regarding setup well I never stated that this isnt something that requires a lot of dedication. You could always show up earlier and set things up speaking of physical equipment like maps dice or any other props you might need. Keep in mind this will never become a standard for teaching and only people who would enjoy this kind of preparation would be doing it. I already explained above why this shouldnt take too much time to explain ruleswise. Heres where Ill have to harshly disagree. First of all when it comes to PnPRPGs as a hobby theyre everywhere. Literally. Throw me in any town in the world and I could either find you a group of people already playing or create one simply because theyve never had the opportunity to try it. Im from Croatia and we have a pretty decent scene going on here. Also this misconception is again due to the PnPRPGDampD thing I explained earlier. Multiple rulesets multiple settings. The game will have as much realism as you want it to have.You ask if parents would pay me to teach their kids to play PnPRPGs. Im not going to teach them to play. Ill use the game to teach them English. Big difference. My parents paid a language school to teach me English. We played games from age  to . Now Im a MA level student of English. For  years all of my memories from that place are fun memories full of games. Each had a specific purpose but cleverly hidden so we learned something usually without even noticing it. Also Id never dream of trying to replace the standard model. This is simply a fun alternative for students who would find it enjoyable. Regarding finding a school to attempt such a thing well I already found one. The same one I attended. I talked to the principal gave him a quick preview of a game by simply having him imagine a scenario and asking him what he does in the given situation and he immediately started coming up with ideas to use the PnPRPGs. This is a man who is in his fifties and teaches CAECPE level English and prepares his students for said exams with an over  success rate Im probably off by a few  but I cant find the page with the exact graph atm sorry  .This entire theory doesnt base itself on the standard classroom but instead on the very question if the application of PnPRPGs is feasible at all and whether or not it makes a difference. If you manage to peaque your students interest even for a lesson or two if they start playing at home it might already make a huge difference. This is a highly unconventional approach and Im interested to see if it works. Again keep in mind that the version of PnPRPGs you know is by no means the only way to do them. Theyre extremely flexible and can be shaped to your needs. The roleplays from textbooks always felt very unnatural and artificial for me as a learner at least because there was no personal involvement besides simply doing the given task. PnPRPGs give a context and create an actionreaction based environment which requires involvement from the learner.Also you need to look at the bigger picture  playing a PnPRPG isnt just about killing the monsters solving the quests. Its about learning to cooperate with your friends solving social dilemmas putting people into a situation which requires problem solving. These are all skills needed in the real world solved by real world language. Language very much usable in the real world  If you think its all about killing ogres and casting spells youre waaaay off D I think you should actually play a game or two! DWhew you really gave me a run for my money here. If theres anything else youd like to know or I wasnt clear on something please do let me know. ,TEFL,cj2tw90,2,t5_2qq76

3692694,0,t1_cqcwuv7,The question of what is meant by equivalent  is complex. What does equivalency mean? The CELTA has certain standards and a certain philosophy. It has certain assessment criteria. Other courses  are either carbon copies or they are different. American degrees are not equivalent to British degrees. UK and US universities dont recognise each others degrees. They are not equivalent. The idea that  hours of content makes something equivalent is ludicrous. It depends on the pedagogical approach and assessment standards. It depends upon the level at which the course is delivered.If some one does CELTA Trinity cert etc then everyone knows what they have but no other certificate has detailed information about course content approach and assessment criteria. There are a few courses for instance that only require you to work through a few multiple choice questions. Other courses clear are rigorous but dont focus on teaching skills but on academic theory. These courses may be really good but they lack transparency. It is true that the CELTA Trinity CELT and SIT dont publish this stuff online but everyone knows what they involve.

IE they dont need it. The FEC is bound to you and your current employer and no one else except govt officials need to see it.Another trick... when I resigned from the uni the HR girl wanted my passport back so she could cancel the residence permit.

You semi future proof yourself from future increases in job requirements... and opens up some higher positions where it is a minimum requirement.gtand the salaries from eikaiwas and ALT positions arent always too fantastic at all and b the hoursworkplaces can be really really hit or misgt That being said Ive seen comments floating around that holding a masters degree in education or linguistics can open the door to a more prestigious position at an international school or even a university if youre lucky.Um what makes you think that these institutions are a panacea for money and work hours? If it is a proper school then they will work you for the money you make. If not in lesson time in seat warming extra curricular activities and also paper trails and accountability. Detailed lesson plans which need you to write a paragraph as to why youve done something on a lesson plan can quickly suck up your time. Marking  curricular creation and modification ILPs student reports students who approach you with issues can all drain your time not forgetting observations inspections team meetings and stuff.Consider these situations Ive been in the past  yearsCrappy language school h my duties were to turn up on time open the text book and run them through the exercises. Coat hat... gone at the end.Slightly better language school  my duties were to write a bare bones lesson plan. Go to the cupboard grab the materials and run the class  minutes on lesson review and notes to coteacher. Coat hat gone.th form college h Have to write a detailed lesson plan. I then have to look through the learner profiles and look for learner problems and performance of the previous class. I then have to pepper my lesson plan with DIF which means differentiation for a specific learner to address those problems. I then have to add in EXT extension tasks for if learners finish quickly. I then have to fill in the side bar notes and enter a code there are  codesto justify why I am doing such a task. Because of DIF my worksheets and materials have to be modified to suit. A gap fill for instance gap fills are frowned upon for a very weak learner you might put I walk to school. The stronger learner get I  to school. THEN I run the lesson. I take the register do a warmer and introduce them to a task concept check then give them  minutes. I scrabble around marking their home work writing them on a piece of paper an old register. I do this multiple times.  hours later at the end I have to write a lesson review on MOODLE which demands I write  words min. I then have to go through each learner profile and punch the scores for the tasks in and also write any issues or problems they have. Every  weeks I have a  with the student to discuss any issues. The HoD every week will download a random lesson plan off your MOODLE space and check the progress. student issues can also suck up a huge amount of time. I had this student once from Iran. Silly sod had been hit by a car the culture being different he thought it was hit fault so he legged it. He turned up to my class and was really quiet. I asked him if he was ok he said yes. He wasnt so I asked him to go outside for a chat. Saw him limp called Sarah the welfare officer and we were sat outside for  minutes waiting for an ambulance. A similar incident happened where one had his wisdom teeth out. He seemed really quiet one day. So I asked him... no response. I kept him for  minutes afterwards trying to figure what was wrong. He drew pictures and I got it. He then got out the letter detailing his dental surgery. I had to go photocopy that as evidence of his poor performance in class.,TEFL,cslateu,5,t5_2qq76

Schools are probably getting desperate to find teachers now. The school should pay you extra for extra hours. My school pays  rmb for any extra class hours  minutes Try universities in Nanjing. I know they tend to pay more from ads Ive seen. Make sure your apartment is off campus too. Youll be able to live on that salary easily unless you go out drinking more than x a week but you wont save much. I spend about  rmb a month and I dont really think about my spending but I dont go to bars much and Im somewhat mindful of my spending.Also with  teaching hours you will have lots of free time. Find extra work and you can easily up your salary to rmb. If you work  extra hours at  rmb very easy to get rmbh jobs youll be getting an extra  rmb a month.  This way you can save some money. Once you learn how to wheel and deal you really have the opportunitychoice to make a lot more money that this.This is all for tier  cities.

5135507,0,t3_3latw6,I worked for a school in Tajikistan last year and thoroughly enjoyed it. In terms of requirements for a private language school or a government school there are none as long as youre a native speaker and even Tajiks with no degree of any kind are hired if they speak English. Theyre simply not enough foreigners who go there so they are desperate for teachers. An international school will probably require a degree and certificate though.The people are very friendly because they dont see many foreigners. Expect be invited to peoples houses for tea often especially outside the capital. It helps if you know Russian or Tajik though because few people speak English. The whole country is mountainous and beautiful and if you like hiking youll love spring and summer there.The schools will work you like a dog if you let them so set clear boundaries of how much time your willing to work. Also see if you can get your school to handle your visa dealing with all the ministries is a nightmare of postsoviet bureaucracy.As for the schools these are the ones I know theyre probably more but these are the ones I have impressions of. If youre from America England or Europe any of these places will hire you in a second.Bactria Center The most professional of the schools but with a slightly lower salary than most. Its an NGO and does community and development work in addition to teaching English.MBO Professional Typical language school they pay better than Bactria but are more disorganized with frequent schedule changes. Foreigners always get paid on time.Polyglot Like MBO but with a worse administration and a somewhat spotty record of paying teachers if your thinking if going here youd be better off with one of the other schools.The salary for these is fairly low  a month for Bactria and  for MBO and Polyglot. Thats enough to live quite well in Tajikistan though as the cost of living is dirt cheap.

5934142,0,t1_cxxe5yq,It does sound like a death in the family.Ive experienced recently a colleague here who had to go back to the states for two weeks for something that was I strongly suspect similar. Although I didnt ask wasnt my place to. He was however very clear to our employers that he was going to return. So arrangements was made where he worked extra hours to teach a wholeload of makeup classes on his return which he seemed willing to do and is just about to wrap up.So it is possible to negotiate around this.However I would not encourage your friend to pursue this if he is in a state of grieving or some other as being a foreigner here can be challenging as it is. It might be better for him to bite the bullet on this and end his contract formally.Ive just asked around more experienced colleagues to doublecheck and I can confirm that your friend will lose a months salary after giving the prior notice you mentioned he will also lose his flight reimbursement and endofcontract bonuses. Of course these considerations have to be balanced with level of the pressure hes under if you get me. No amount of money is worth prolonging the stress of having to stay in another country when such issues are going on back home.If your friend is adamant that he should leave to deal with this issue back home then its best he does follow through by giving a months notice citing compassionate grounds. These things do happen and his employer should be able to compensate in reason.This way he wont end up getting blacklisted and placed on a noentry list and he can likely pick up where he left off with another school elsewhere in China when hes back on his feet.My advice to you in this is to take the stance of being close to the person not the problem. That is to say be supportive of him to a point as a friend but not try to get too involved in his problems.  Getting too caught up in this as genuine as it may be would be no good to him or anyone else.

Get a few beers into me or anyone from the CEs office in those days and the stories start coming out.Shane was sold about  years ago and is a whole new game now.

Ill be completely honest with you on all accounts dude. gt You have such a great thing going! Nobody will hire you once you decide to come back if you quit this great job and have English teaching on your resume!How long do you plan to do it?  After one year companies were definietely more reluctanct to hire me than before.  Always popped the question when is the last time you coded how long have you been out in the interview.  After multiple years Id imagine it would be really difficult and youd drop pay grades.gt Youve started building up a career here and now youre just going to sever ties and throw it all away?Well you dont really sever ties I could still get references its just they werent recent referencesgt People view English teaching as a job for losers who had no other option in life.This is a common opinion its subjective but theres a large percentage of the public and even students that feel this way.  However you get all sorts doing it people like us retired professionals young students etc...gt You just want to escape your current situation and this is a drastic irresponsible solution to your current problems with your job!It isnt really that drastic and doing it for a year is a way to feel if its right for you.BTW employers dont value cultural experience in this industry so much as technical skills and project experience.  It really depends on how long you are in it multiple years and it is a huge risk to your career.  Personally I couldnt stand the lower pay rate and lack of respect in the profession so I left teaching but it had its good points.  Id strongly advise you to try for contracts whilst you are working in a school to keep your experience up to date.Being honest I probably wouldnt offer someone an interview if theyve been out the game for over a year unless they had substantial previous experience  years and were cheaper than the going rate.,TEFL,d5jdvmx,5,t5_2qq76

The only time it would be illegal is if you are taking custom from China directly or the business you own back home is not declaring taxes or even registered. E.g. I worked as a freelance software consultant for a while with a business account set up in the UK.  It actually works better because IR tends to hit you if you contract out but work from their offices.  A lot of consultants get screwed and taxed on a PAYE rate because of this if youre working abroad its a moot point.  Software consulting usually pays a daily rate of  USDday in the UK on a  month contract  days  week.  Its extremely safe and good moneyOPs problem is the consulting business is for people with plenty of experience and you need to be damn good at what you do especially if you want to do it from China I had to take a cut on my daily rate but was still making a lot of money doing it.The OP has no chance in hell of earning as much in ESL as he would in his career back hom where kyear is an average salary w experience.

The money was great by local standards but not so much when compared to a US salary. The first school was tough  lessons a day each was  minutes and there was only a  minute break between lessons. Granted they did all the prep work for you but it didnt make it easier. I decided to stay in Russia after I met my wife and I started looking for a better job and found one in St. Petersburg.

Teaching writing is actually a specific skill that most people lack.  Some academics e.g. Wingate actually argue that most native speakers are not really taught how to write adequately and actually need the same resources given to nonnative students because of it.  Writing is a technology that is not related to your ability to speak at a native level or not because native English speaking ability is a completely different skill than writing.,TEFL,d70anl9,2,t5_2qq76

9648267,0,t3_5d3660,I want to address this with a little less negativity though the other replies are correct that its better to have a degree and your spelling and writing are shit. Ive been teaching in SEA Indonesia degreeless for  years now. I only make half as much as teachers with education degrees but I make  times as much as my wife local middleclass office worker. Were doing quite well and the point of what Im saying is that it is possible to do what youre planning to do.Now the first thing you want to decide is if you are going to lie about having a degree. Some people do this and get away with it for a very long time and you will probably convince both schools and Immigration with a forged certificate. Dont do this. If you are caught you will not only get fired your employers will rat you out to immigration and youll spend time in jail before getting deported.The second thing you want to is apply for a volunteer position in HCM or Hanoi somewhere. They should be happy to have someone with a certificate and will help you out finding a bike and accom when you get there. Dont commit to more than a class or two a week you dont want to let them down later. Once youre on the ground and settled give it a week have a good shave and shower put on honesttoGod business clothes I dont care that its fucking hot and start applying in person at the second and third tier private language schools. British Council or international schools would laugh you out of their office dont bother. Youre looking for Wall street English Shane English English Firstand any other names that come up when youre looking. Central recruitment will claim they dont hire degreeless teachers theyre lying. Show up have a chat and hand in a resume. Remember you already have a volunteer position which means classroom experience. Youre already based nearby. Youre presentable and you have a teaching certificate. Ive only tried and tested this in Indonesia but if it doesnt get you a job in Vietnam too I owe you a beer.

9687919,0,t3_5dtjfr,Short answer No one can say for sure right now.Long answer It depends on how the UK Brexits if it goes into the EEA or similar which is becoming increasingly likely youll likely see no change or a slight decrease as it would be a statement to the cohesiveness of the EU and hence there would probably be a greater demand for British teachers. If it has a bad Brexit there could still be the eligibility of EU citizenship for citizens of former states in which case youre going to see a greater supply of British teachers willing to accept a lower pay alongside a lower demand for English teachers as the demand for learning English starts to decrease in favour of other European languages. Or the best case scenario for you would be a bad Brexit with no EU citizenship eligibility for UK citizens however this comes with the same increase of supply and decrease in demand so youll only see it becoming slightly easier to get in.,TEFL,da78p4d,5,t5_2qq76
9795360,0,t3_5fg13d,IMHO it is a bad sign. If their school is worth a damn they would have a somewhat better interview process including tons of questions for you and going down your resume. I am currently interviewing in Korea too but Ive been here a while.  One was at a University that required me to go in person on a weekend and it was about an hour long. Other private schools have included hr minimum including mock lessons and so on. Even at the hagwon level for one I recently interviewed at just in case it was a  interview process and the first one was  mins second one was in person but I turned it down.  However if you have a CELTA with no experience IMHO not much you can aim for besides avoiding nightmare situations.

At my current job we have a very short amount of time with the students each week and little opportunity to carry out lessons that build and stretch out over more than one class period.  Once I get through one lesson more often than not its on to another random point that likely has random new vocabulary and limited time for making sure students have understanding or mastery.Sometimes things go well enough but theres one class I have with such a wide range of students  that its nearly impossible to take advantage of that time to be productive for all of them with one  minute period.  The smartest students need conversational exercises and creative practice that pushes them but the lower students have trouble with even the simplest of tasks and need more structured scaffolded lessons.If the former isnt being challenged or the latter isnt able to follow their behavior goes out the window.

However Im not sure about the demand for an English speaking mathscience teacher I dont think there are many science programs in English but I dont really know either. Eitherway international schools still pay better than uni at least in China.For Thailand maybe search through Ajarn.com I prefer China over Thailand due to Thailands low pay unless you work at the elite schools. I teach high school science,TEFL,de0g79f,1,t5_2qq76

11073707,0,t3_5y024r,I studied abroad in  and worked at the tutoring center while I was taking classes at an American University. I ended up doing a workshop on plagiarism for a final project while I was there. I was always told by students and other professors that plagiarism is something that is acceptable in China. Students should not be required to cite anything they use because it should be common knowledge to an educated person is what I was told the numerous times I brought this issue up with staff. To be clear they were not excusing plagiarism but offering an explanation as to why the Chinese students had a hard time understanding the issues surrounding plagiarism in the west. I really had to take the time with the students I tutored or worked with to explain that while plagiarism is accepted in their culture it is not allowed in American Universities. When I stressed the fact that if they are caught plagiarizing they could receive an XF on their transcript for that class. And that if a future employer requests their transcripts they will be able to see the student received an XF which at my university means a student was caught cheatingplagiarizing. ,TEFL,den70m0,1,t5_2qq76

11306608,0,t3_60z52i,Japan resident and university teacher here.As you probably know unis here generally want MA in TESOLapplied linguisticsrelated subject  your MA in English will likely count as a related subject I have an MA in Japanese literature and that got me in I have friends with MAs in history etc that also got it so the MA in TESOL may be redundant.You have enough teaching experience already IMO.The thing that may hold you back is the publications but this is easy to rectify  join JALT or find some other journals and work towards publishing.  will be enough for most jobs  the quality of journal almost doesnt matter  at entry level uni jobs they just want to see that you have the desire and aptitude to publish they arent expecting groundbreaking work.Another poster above posted some job sites so keep checking them once a week and apply for some stuff and see what happens. Good luck!edit  possibly obvious advice but youll have more luck with the universities that hire several teachers at once the ones with big programs  the postings that have only one position open only will probaby not consider you theyll be flooded with candidates.,TEFL,dfdl547,2,t5_2qq76

11568877,0,t1_dg73s9l,I am aware that teaching in Thailand without a degree extremely difficult however If i do accept this offer I will be in Thailand on a business visa and will have a work permit which will be suitable for the full time job Im being offered as well as the teaching. I expect most of my students to be around  y.o. and would do lessons in small groups of around  students.That is the goal longterm but as I mentioned i am still studying for my degree so getting employed by an actual school is not an option.

11606594,0,t1_dgblvw3,Agreed. With  year experience and a Celta maybe k is about right. Maybe with a license or a Masters.   I looked into China after my second year in Korea and was not offered above k once. I looked again after my th year and a masters and while it wasnt raining jobs I did get an offer for k and one for k both in Beijing. I also met the VP of an international school in Shanghai on a trip to Malaysian Borneo. He said to give him a call when I get a license in teaching science and he would offer me k USD starting.

Otherwise most of my other offers were around  RMB. Still I didnt take it because they wanted me to teach illegally on a tourist visa for the first month.  They also lied about the negotiated hours and revised contract said I would have to be physically present at the school for  hours..  I was also told initially I would get an apartment but later they changed it to a housing subsidy.
