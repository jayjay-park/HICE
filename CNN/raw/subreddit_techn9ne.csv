3909923,0,t3_357sgz,If I could pick my top  it would be WitherSpeedomWorldly AngelRoadkillBurn It Down. In no order just the whole album is fucking beast I loved it and probably will never get tired. The only complaint is the lack of Strange features. Three Ces is considered one to me out of the rest of strange was struck me when I first heard of the track list. But over all it was a great album .. Would recommend to everyone. ,techn9ne,cr1ysls,7,t5_2sax4
