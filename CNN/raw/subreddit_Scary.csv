2514999,0,t3_2bppqn,Well I have this this huge mirror in my living room which lets you see like literally the whole room. Its so big that if you look from the stairs you can also see yourself and anyone else in the room and also the hall too..It was Friday and My parents had gone to Florida for a wedding and left me home alone for the whole weekend. Fast forward to SaturdaySunday night I woke up around AM and decided to go down stairs to use the bathroom. Well on my way to the bathroom I saw something that till this day will haunt me for the rest of my life..  As I was walking down the stairs I couldnt help but look in the mirror and notice a strange sighting.......I had no socks on!! The floor was so cold!! Noooo!!!  I screamed and fell to my knees hands in my head crying. ,Scary,cmmujxx,1,t5_2ql2q
