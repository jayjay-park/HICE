3402486,0,t1_cpe42sb,Its good that you mentioned the hospital scene. Nothing in that scene would make one suspect that Tom worked for Red. If fact if he did then their conversation doesnt make any sense. Tom pretended not to recognise Red to maintain his cover but he knew who Red was since he was working for Berlin and Red was the target. You believe that he didnt know Red hired him initially. Ok possible explanation. Someone hires him to keep an eye on Liz and midway his handler informs him of an employer change and so he follows the new orders not realizing that his new target is his former employer. And this would have ok if the writers didnt decide to be clever in Season  by adding the fact that Tom knew Red had hired him. He told Red after Liz kidnapped him that he didnt betray their connection to Liz. Red gave him a final payout to secure his silence and a warning never to see her again. So we come a back a full circle and now that hospital scene doesnt make sense again.,TheBlackList,cpg3xid,0,t5_2whmr

Though Im kinda under the impression that Lizzies father is still alive and Red has done everything in his power to keep her father from knowing she is alive. I think Red is terrified of Liz leaving him. Shes the only one who he has allowed to get close. He has grown to love Liz beyond what he thought was possible.If her father is a career criminal then he might be in league with the Cabal or she is the heir to a massive criminal organization that is also at war with Red. So perhaps if he keeps Liz on his side he has a way of not only protecting her but protecting himself and his ever expanding empire.

5295562,0,t3_3nivzs,. Liz killed Connolly. So she is guilty and Aram is the one thats a bit off base. But I think the deeper question is  do they believe that shes an FSB agent? . I posted something on this about Resslers state of mind. Ressler took a zero percent chance of success shot and he did it while shooting from the hip. Ressler is really lucky that she didnt just shoot him.. The Troll Hunter failed and failed spectacularly. By showing that he was in  places at once on the south side of town the Troll Hunter let Ressler know that it was all a fake and kinda pointed them north. So his usefulness diminished to nothing as far as Red was concerned. Add to that the fact that he said after this were done and Red could then see him as more of a danger than an asset. It wasnt bad writing. In fact both Red and Ressler reacted exactly in character. Red always offers some kind of quid pro quo. In fact Red took it a step further. He gave Ressler exactly what hes done all along. Maybe that will help Ressler understand Reds motive at some point down the line. He also called Ressler a man of honor which appeals to both reality Ressler is somewhat honorable at least and to Resslers ego not in a bad way but its pretty clear that Ressler was always the company man and always seemed to see himself as the honorable cog in all the machinery of the task force. Ressler sees himself as honorable and Red played to that.,TheBlackList,cvoki3z,17,t5_2whmr

From my viewpoint while the depiction of where the Director landed may be offensive to those from or familiar with the country my take away from that was that they were trying to show that the Director was dropped off in the middle of nowhere and they choose certain items to evidence that such as an old model TV a simple house and basically an area that may not be aware of world events. However it was just happenstance that the family was watching the international news telling the story of the Director who just crashed through the house. ,TheBlackList,cz0e54e,1,t5_2whmr

I mean the way that Liz is staring at her wrist over Reddingtons grave certainly seems to imply that theres a negative relationship between Red and the scar.

I just felt that no matter what Megan did there was never any hope of her standing up alongside Spader without people making comparisons that were unbalanced due to his phenomenal talent and following.  Megan is a fine actor with or without Tom it is just hard for her to shine when Spader is a walking talking supernova on the screen. The early part of this season though I thought she was given a lot more to work with and she nailed it. Less kidnapping damsel in distress tears every five minutes etc have all improved Liz in my eyes. The newer writing due to her pregnancy probably could not be avoided but it is not as compelling as the Lizzie on the run story was imo. ,TheBlackList,d0ziz0j,3,t5_2whmr

10757704,0,t1_ddpj79g,The only thing I know for certain is that nothing is certain  The Blacklist is NOT a mystery in the sense of providing clues from which a careful observer can figure out the mystery  to the contrary the writes have gone out of there way to provide a basis for multiple many possibilities. ConsiderRed may or may not be the guy who left the NavyRed may have had serious plastic surgeryDNA alteration may be possible.Reds tale to Madeline Pratt may be entirely true somewhat true or entirely false.Lizs memories be entirely true somewhat true or entirely false.Red says he has never lied to Liz but that may be a lie.We know of incidents that may or may not have happened contemporaneously.Everything we saw in Cape May was an opium hallucination but it might have been all true or partially true. And on and on  regardless of how the writers resolve the series theyll have support AND also be able to disregard contrary clues.,TheBlackList,ddpks40,4,t5_2whmr
10764074,0,t1_ddp9pl5,because if they give us any definitive answer we will see the whole thing right away. If they tell us who Dom is to Red the game is over. Same with the night of the fire.  if they tells us who Jennifer is now the same happens. They have told us but in a way that is a like a very slow fade in. they put a spotlight on Dom showed us the relationship he is Katarinas father and in the process basically told us that Red views Liz as a daughter and Dom accepts him as Lizs daughter. They also told us that Liz was also known as Masha. Spotlight fades and Dom is never mentioned again.Red is a wordsmith. He basically told Rostov what he meant he is no longer Lizs father because Sam raised her and he promised Sam that Sam will always be her father a solemn promise before mercykilling him. Rostov was also a father to Liz because he consider her as such for the  years he lived with him as his daughter.  But that will never change that Liz is his daughter. So it is a question of the right question been answered. Are you her father? vs. Is Liz your daughter?. To most people is the same thing but if you split hairs it is not. He had said it aloud  times before in cape May when he repeats Her father. Yes. When he said Thats my girl in Gina Zanetakos and when he assured Sam he would always be her father. and they implied it in The Arthax Network with Dom.The story of Tom and Liz had basically given us the story of Red and Katarina we got our first clue when the OREA agent called her a pinko Mata Hari and said she was an amalgamation of  different women. Which should have told us she was an undercover agent so talented people thought she was  people.I suspect Redemption will give us other pieces of the puzzle even as it stands on its own and if they have to repeat the clues in TBL.  I suspect at the end both stories will collide as they are part of the cabals competition and will be drawn in for a last battle.About Jennifer one has to look at Red dealing with betrayal inside his organization swiftly and harshly Newton Kate Mr. Vargas Niko and would be Tom had he not been protected by Lizs love for him and look at the way he deals with the  people we know he considers his family Liz and Dembe. Both have done things against his wishes and both have inflicted pain but no more than a jab has been given and a look of being pained by it. Consider that he did the same with Tom in the plane. Why? because he is now family he is the father of his grandchild. His son on law. So now consider which other character had committed an act of treason against him and not only he smiles sadly and provides her with a way out? Emma Knightley. So the only available conclusion is that Emma is like a child to him she is blonde Jennifer bubble girl ballerina girl and girl in the cabin pictures. Spot light off.So we cannot say we have not been given answers. We have but veiled. because once  piece is placed firmly unveiled in the puzzle all the others fall into place at once.,TheBlackList,ddq8g4l,2,t5_2whmr

11032453,0,t1_deigk38,gt But I think some of these changes in character can probably be attributed to having to extend this thing that long and making them run out of runway on the original storyline.Liz stopped being funny or interesting bc they have been pushing the story too long? Cooper turned into her gay hairdresser basically for the same reason? Ressler and Diembe are cardboard cut outs now they are regressing as time goes on if anythingI think more likely the problem is that the show runners have bled talent into their other  shows amp this one is running in place as a resultgt But the Liz character has been somewhat obtuse right from the get go.youre talking about a woman on her first day on the job who recognized a gas grenade attack before it even happened and who later that week stabbed Red in the neck with a pen supposedly in such a way as to barely not kill himshe went from a hyper competent Mary Sue to a completely incompetent red shirt in the course of  seasons amp its not believable in the least,TheBlackList,deii4tj,1,t5_2whmr

11477397,0,t1_dfvqj4p,gt In fact she knew that because she told Red she understood what he had to do.To be honest I didnt get that impression and I dont remember her saying that so I am going to be digging through the dialogue once again .  Mr. Kaplan wanted Red to say that he understood why she had to fake Lizs death  that she was merely trying to protect Liz and her child and she would do it again.    But Red never acknowledged that although he did apologize for having to harm Little Nikos. But unless I missed something she never really told Red to his face that she understood why he had to kill her  except that she might know too much  which Ill explain later.This is when Red Tom and Kate are on the jet I believe when Kirk has Liz and Mato has the baby.gtKate This is my fault. If anything happens to Elizabeth or the baby... gtTom to Kate You have nothing to apologize for. You tried to help us find a normal life. Id take that risk again. gtTom to Red  I dont regret trying to get away from you. I was thrilled that Tom seemed to accept responsibility for faking Lizs death here that he would do it again to get away from Red and he didnt  want Mr. Kaplan to apologize for anything.  Later  when Kate and Tom  are in the car  after Tom has tortured Little Nikos and they are waiting for Mato to show upgtTom Sorry about Nikos. gtMr. Kaplan You did your job. gtTom I know but... I didnt mean to... He knew where my baby was all right? Thats the only reason I pushed so hard. gtMr. Kaplan  Why are you telling me this? gtTom Because hes your friend. gtMr. Kaplan  So you want me to make you feel better?   Everyone wants me to make things easier for them. Cleaner. Thats what I am after all the Cleaner. In my desire to make life easier for your baby I betrayed Raymond and now he doesnt know what to do with me. Well he knows what he has to do and he wants me to make it easier for him. But I wont. Im not here to make him feel better and Im not here to make you feel better Tom.He knows what he has to do.  I suppose this is what you meant that members of a criminal enterprise would accept that the expected punishment for betrayal is death.Right before Red shoots KategtRed You understand Kate that I gtKate Have no choice? Isnt that the speech Raymond? That I know too much? Every single one of your weaknesses all your faults all your secrets. I dedicated my life to you. You entrusted me with everything you value your freedom your life a child. I have never failed you.I guess the argument has to be made that Red could no longer trust her with the knowledge of his faults his weaknesses... his secrets.  So he had to kill her because she knew too much.  Thats what Mr. Kaplan seemed to be saying right before she was shot.  I still feel that their  long standing  mutual respect and affection should have been infinitely more important to Red than the need to enforce any criminal enterprise rules.  She wasnt just an employee or a criminal associate...  she was family.And I have to include this what Kate told the woodsman because it sums up everything so perfectly.  Sorry Im having so much fun with dialogue today.gtKate The man you saw in the picture was my employer. He lost his way. At least thats how I saw it. He placed a lovely young woman and her baby girl in terrible danger... not deliberately mind you. He loves them deeply. Enough to blind him to the reality that his very presence in their lives constitutes a threat. Not just to them but to himself as well. I tried to help her. All I managed to do was to place her and the child in even greater danger. My efforts earned me a bullet in the head. This man he is very dangerous and absolutely relentless. If he even suspects I survived there will be no place I can be safe. The reason I didnt tell you the truth was not to protect him but to protect you.This is an interesting comment Kate makes that Red being in Lizs life not only poses a danger to Liz and her child but also to Red himself.   So perhaps in a way Mr. Kaplan was also trying to save Red as well that for some reason Liz being in his life poses a threat.Theres yet another reason that Red should have thanked Mr. Kaplan for her efforts  instead of killing her.If Mr. Kaplan shows up as expected  and if she is going to be an adversary... its going to be really hard to root for Red.,TheBlackList,dfwyj61,1,t5_2whmr
