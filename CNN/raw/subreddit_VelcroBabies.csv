262462,0,t1_cf7wvn4,He startles very easily at sounds like sneezing or reading the back of the shampoo bottle in Spanish. Ever since he was born he would need to be smacked really hard on the butt to fall asleep shushed really loudly jiggled almost violently. He needs the feel of heavy pressure while sleeping or he wakes up constantly. Ive spoken with sleep consultants who either have children with Sensory Processing Disorder or are Occupation Therapy Early Interventionists and they agree that while he probably doesnt have full blown SPD he does have some issues with his nervous system processing the world. ,VelcroBabies,cf7yony,2,t5_2wzib
687006,0,t3_2210lc,Im not sure this is the answer youre looking for but I wanted to chime in that your doctor was giving parenting advice here not medical advice. Doctors are trained in medicine not parenting. Usually their parenting advice comes from personal experience and the research they did for their own kids which may or may not be current and may or may not work for your kid. Im sure the advice was well intended but you dont have to follow it by any means.  Personally I found the best solution for naps early on to be wearing my baby so she could get quality sleep as she only does while cuddling and I could still move around. This may or may not work for you guys. Remember you are the expert on your baby and only you know what works and doesnt work!,VelcroBabies,cgid47i,9,t5_2wzib
689492,0,t3_2210lc,Our son now  was a high needs baby when he was little.  I read a lot of books and websites on sleep training.  We tried cry it out and it was miserable for us and him.  In the end I got rid of the books and just followed my instincts.  I broke the rules and nursed him to sleep every night until he was about  months old because thats what HE needed.  Gradually our routine shifted according to what he needed to fall asleep.  And for several months now weve been able to put him down in his crib for bed awake with a nightlight and a few stuffed animals and he goes to sleep on his own.  Instead of making our baby do something that he wasnt ready for because it was what WE wanted him to do we took our cues from him and let him tell us what he needed to feel comforted loved and safe when he goes to sleep.  What worked for our son may not work for your baby so the best advice I can give to you is to trust yourself listen to your baby and youll know just what to do thats right for him.  ,VelcroBabies,cginati,7,t5_2wzib
1015168,0,t3_25q877,I havent been dealing with this as long as you but its an issue for us as well. Since my sex drive hasnt returned  weeks pp I just tell my husband to take care of himself and Ill try to join him for the ending if the baby will sleep. Its weird I know but otherwise he wouldnt get any. Ever.  And please dont make yourself do it with a screaming baby in the next room. That feeling of guilt and panic and sadness that you get should never be associated with sex.  ,VelcroBabies,chjojz7,9,t5_2wzib

2969876,0,t3_2t34gc,I would love to supply a success story but I cant.  My velcro kid was  years old when he started daycare and although he transitioned fairly well to actually being there six months later its still a huge drama actually getting him there.  After half a freakin year of going there a good dropoff is when he only screams when we get in the car calms down to snuffles halfway there and then cries miserably when I actually leave him.Im going to be that guy and say seriously at  months if you can possibly afford to leave work even for a few more months consider it.  If your kid has the same temperament as mine... I shudder to imagine having to do daycare at  months.  I dropped out to be a SAHD at . months and it was traumatic enough for him just switching from mommy to daddy at home with him all day.,VelcroBabies,co5ou49,2,t5_2wzib

5881692,0,t1_cxp23rm,I cant remember exactly but she is very accommodating  dont rule her out because of cost. If you reach out and explain your situation she may be able to meet you half way. xoxoxox,VelcroBabies,cxqmfam,1,t5_2wzib
5977281,0,t3_3x80ap,I had a very hard time night weaning my daughter so I can empathize with you. I also tried to do a gradual weaning but in hindsight wondered if cold turkey for night feedings only would have been easier for her to understand. I find one of the most important things for weaning and parenting in general is to be consistent. If you are weaning you cant give in some nights or you will just prolong the process. Your reactions to their behavior need to be predictable. You may be encouraged to hear that I had a much easier time completely weaning. I let her have a low sugar frozen yogurt popsicle instead of milkies and as she rarely gets treats she thought that was quite acceptable ha ha. Once the box was empty we were all done. Good luck! ,VelcroBabies,cy35if9,1,t5_2wzib
6866149,0,t1_d0uado7,Thanks my wife told me about the fourth trimester we just hope he calms down at the end of it. As far as diet we were breastfeeding but we both got very ill recently and my wife hasnt been able to produce since it didnt help that she was having some difficulty beforehand. Were in the middle of transitioning from Earths Best which gave him some trouble at first to Gerber Soy hopefully thatll have some effect. Part of what bothers me so much is since hes my first I go looking for articles to read to help and there are articles saying they should  be able to lift themselves up with their arms a little and grasp at things so I feel like Im not doing enough but also since hes my first Ive got no grounds for comparison.,VelcroBabies,d0ul6yn,2,t5_2wzib
7395890,0,t1_d2ir04f,She doesnt formulate a lot of words but she recognizes words and says some things. She understands most of what we say and she does babble quite a bit. But if Im in a different room she will yell mama! Until I respond its like a completely meltdown for her. ,VelcroBabies,d2iv48r,2,t5_2wzib
