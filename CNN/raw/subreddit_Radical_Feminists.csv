10208096,0,t1_dbxen1q,Very good article. My husband and I are raising daughters and a son. I have no idea how to make sure he turns out. I hope he is like his dad. I have been bugging my husband about talking to him about these things. ,Radical_Feminists,dc157oy,1,t5_388ol

10495092,0,t1_dcww00v,I actually moved somewhere very very rural but also very close to the large city I lived in hard to explain without giving it away but best of both worlds. I get to play my music very loud and max the bass without being an asshole. The deer come around and are like Hey whos playing? One morning it was snowing and there were deer outside the window sleeping getting snowed on mom and baby. How is that real.One of the things I hated about that city was the noise. Wed move to an apartment we could afford and then all of a sudden wed have construction around us that would go on forever. Then it would finish and the rent would go up hundreds of dollars so wed move somewhere more affordable and again... It was so frustrating. The noise really was driving me mad at the last place we were surrounded and wed have cranes hovering over our building at night which made us and our neighbors nervous the traffic on the road shook the building it was on a hill that was going down if an earthquake hit. People around also stressed me out. No escape you know? You never knew when someone was going to jump out like HI! Im apparently not welladjusted enough for that.,Radical_Feminists,dcxq946,5,t5_388ol
