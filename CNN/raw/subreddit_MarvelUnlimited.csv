2997552,0,t3_2uhnsh,Just that it frequently crashes if my Internet connection isnt strong. If Im out and about I usually put my tablet on Airplane mode so that I know the app wont crash. Also it would be nice to have an inbuilt reading order feature for larger storylines. For instance Im reading Secret Invasion in New Avengers right now but the app only prompts me to read the next issue of New Avengers  it doesnt let me know about where the storyline crosses over with Mighty Avengers which I didnt even know was a thing etc. Id like to have this as part of the app rather than having to Google reading orders after I realise Ive missed out on a bunch of issues.,MarvelUnlimited,co8ozoq,4,t5_2ydn4
3067800,0,t3_2va60k,I think it was an ultron figure for a few years. The rocket figure is kinda new so it might be there for awhile. I would get the I think plan. Its seems like their events which are another perk of the  plan happen in LA or NY unless you live there. The promo code spot is for sometimes they have one month sales. The two I can think of are they had a . for one month sale and a two months for the price of one sale. Maybe they also give out free codes for press. But its not like pizza places where you can find a ton of codes online. Its mostly something marvel will promote on the site.,MarvelUnlimited,cofz2fq,2,t5_2ydn4

3701738,0,t3_32aqvs,Using my iPhone  in portrat mode disabled the smart panels. With the new double tap enable I have used it this morning a few times though. In portrat mode it works like a charm you see the entire panel and the text is clear to read. Yesterday I borrowed a friends iPad for a second tested it out and of course you see the entire page which is awesome but youve got more to cary if youre using it as your main ready device.

5326385,0,t1_cvsdf9n,The only problem with that is you are looking at hundreds of comics from various writers and titles all of varying quality. There is some good stuff in every era but LOTS of crap too. By all means go for it if you want to but the comics themselves dont even follow continuity all of the time and the majority of things that happen ultimately end up not mattering. I typically find a series or writer that I like and start at . In the case of very longrunning series like Uncanny starting out when a new writer comes on is usually the easiest option. Marvel typically has really good recap pages especially in more contemporary comics that should get you up to speed. If you are still lost you can also look up the series on Wikipedia to fill in the gaps.,MarvelUnlimited,cvsi9zi,2,t5_2ydn4

I did that with Civil War in the suggested order only to find out the library doesnt save them in the order you added them it saves them in the order of their release date.

9542869,0,t3_5bjv9b,For classic XMen you want Chris Claremonts stuff. Start with GiantSized XMen  and then go to Uncanny XMen  and keep going from there. Claremont finishes his run around  and much of the s are a bit meh. Claremont is essentially the guy who made the XMen what they are. This is when the period when Marvel comics was massively dominated by XMen and various spinoffs. So even if its a little bit old its worth reading because of how influential it was.For newer stuff you can read Grant Morrisons run on New XMen  from  to . This introduced a lot of things that are now essential parts of the XMen canon such as Emma Frosts diamond skin and revealing that Logan is actually Wolverines last name.But probably my favourite run is Joss Whedons Astonishing XMen   and then Giant Sized Astonishing XMen. Its just got a good mix of action and characterisation with plenty of Whedonstyle humour along the way.,MarvelUnlimited,d9pcuce,5,t5_2ydn4
