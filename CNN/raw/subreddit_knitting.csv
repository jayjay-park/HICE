Were I to recreate this I would choose a fingering weight yarn with a lot of halo probably mohair because Ill take any excuse to use it and knit strips an inch or so wide.

Otherwise I think the two sets of needles are about equal in quality and it comes down to personal preference.

Unfortunately Im not versed enough in Journey to create or Google a pattern.. Create a Graph of how many stitches you plan to make your item include increases decreases etc.. Create an extra layer for ease of use you can also layer your images on top of each other as long as you can select the template image and delete it at the end.. Place in aI its under filegtplace the template picture onto the layer furthest back. Or  paste the template image into your window and arrange it to the back. Position the template behind the stitches to fit how you want it to look. Mark the template layer as a template layer double click or right click the layer.. Color squares or place knitting pattern symbols into the chart ie  O YO etc by trying to match the pattern behind as closely as possible.. Make the template layer invisible click the eye on the layer or select the template image and delete it.. Profit.,knitting,cgjwqgt,5,t5_2qiu0
702049,0,t3_2279pf,Do you know double knitting? I love it sooo much IMO its also the easiest colorwork to get professional results at quickly so if youre feeling ambitious I think this one here has a clean modern feel. Now some single colors...Counterpanes are a kind of old technique but they dont have to be grandmaish For a simple and symbolic pattern try this loveknot.Feeling more Norse than Celtic? Heres another modern counterpane!This one is a little small but that could be a good chance to try designing with minimal commitment  throw a border of our favorite stitch on it or if youre really looking for a challenge you could knit the couples initials in a purl motif around the center panel.And one more just because I like it. I like blankets but Id need a big occasion  like a wedding!  to convince me to start another so I have a lot of patterns in my faves  I LOVE the heirloom chevron you linked and while the eleventh hour looks cozy and great be careful of the strain not to mention cost of working with such a huge bulky project. If you go with a log cabintype thing Id try to find a pattern the works the blocks together as you go  seaming takes forever and a lot of concentration and is  not the kind of thing you want to rush. One more N.B. were you going to stick to the pattern suggested colors? Choosing colors that really complement especially out of a more limited yarn line can be more difficult than you expect. Think about and plan those choices very carefully And last of all best of luck! Your friends are lucky to have someone around who would put so much work and love into a gift.

848752,0,t3_23uqpq,This is a rolled hat.  I learned in a knitting shop.  Here is how I made it.  I cast on  on a size  small circular needle.  Knitted together to form the circle.  The length of a persons hand from palm to end of middle finger is the length from top of head to top off ear.  I knit that lengththen marked off every  stitches.Then decrease  every marker by knitting  together.  When you have about  stitches I move them to  DPN  stitches each.   approx Continue to decrease each needle until there is  or  on each needle.  Almost forgot!  If you have gappingjust knit one over to another needle now and then. When you have  or left make a tail and use a yarn needle. Thread the tail into the needle and pull it through all the stitches as you take them off the needles.  Pull it down through the middle and make it sinch up tight.  Sew back and forth across the end a few times tie it then weave the end in.  Also weave in the tail at the beginning. To get the pattern I started at the first full color on the varigate. I bought this yarn at hobby lobby.  What do you think?? Ask if you have questions! Edit I had NO idea what the pattern would be.  It zig zagged and eventually spiralled. ,knitting,ch0r9sg,5,t5_2qiu0

Because you can fix the gap in your cast on row when you weave in the tail left from casting on but if you use something that thick as a stitch marker its going to leave a gap between the stitches on either side of the marker big enough to accommodate your marker on every round.When I cast on I use this method but I dont count that first weird loop as a stitch I just slip it on the first round and knit it together with the last stitch to close the round. ,knitting,cj6z1te,2,t5_2qiu0

As far as changing colors the main thing to remember is to pick up the new color under the current color to secure the other strand behind your work.  I havent really done a lot of colorwork mostly just to use a different trim color than main color which is more like intarsia but I believe you want to look for videos about fair isle knitting  You have to carry your colors along the back of the work loosely enough that the hat still has some stretch but tightly enough that there arent gaps between the stitches.

I said I could since Im in between projects and the pattern she wanted was a hood in super bulky yarn shouldnt take more than two days. I said I would gift her my time since she knows me and I knit her daughter a pig when she was born. I know this person appreciates the work that goes into something hand made. Materials were  she paid me . Took a day she loved it. She told me she was going to post it on her Facebook and tag me in the picture. Thats fine I dont mind. She turned it into a full blown ad for my services. She can make anything you want! Custom! And heres the kicker Only . I corrected her in a comment saying I could follow almost any knitting pattern credited the pattern and designer used for her and that they can PM me and I can quote a price based on the project they want.Well the orders came rolling in. People sending pictures of patterns from Etsy asking for projects that would take weeks. The first one was a full cape and hood in seed stitch  pieces color work. I quoted . She was offended. I could buy a hat at Target for less than half that! Well go to Target then. Supplies plus my hourly rate just above min wage would be . Yeah she didnt want it anymore. I used to feel bad about charging what Im worth but its an important part of keeping my hobby a hobby. If you have items already made go to Etsy and find similar things and look how they are priced. Dont sell your talents short!,knitting,cjhw6na,17,t5_2qiu0

Finally we decided to head out before the end of the th inning and before we even made it out of the park cannon! We kept walking barely made it to the gates cannon! Good grief. Started walking out to the parking lot FIREWORKS! SERIOUSLY?! I told mom there was no way I could stay any longer because a it was after  and I had had a long day at work and was exhausted.  b obviously we were the reason that they werent doing well because as soon as our happy butts got up they turned around. We werent going to mess with that especially after the news of Wash. Overall though it was a fun time with my mom.Other than that not a very productive weekend. Caught up on Doctor Who watched some more Twin Peaks enjoyed the storm knit up a storm on my Rhaegar shawl and got some new clothes.And now since work has been absolutely CRAZY today flooding in Phoenix has our phones going bonkers in Dallas I think Im going to eat enough candy corn to make myself sick and try to hide under my desk until they forget Im supposed to be here. ,knitting,ckcjbir,6,t5_2qiu0

They only need to fill up the space entirely if youre working in the round. Are you making a scarf?edit I see the link now. If you use circulars for this you will need two sets of any size. I like  or . Half of the stitches will go on one needle set and half will go on the other set.

1911784,0,t3_2gimz2,Not sure if it is still the case but at some point the fastest recorded knitting was done knitting English style. Ive seen this topic time and time again and what works for one doesnt work for all. I am not a fan of the statement that continental is faster because it made me feel like I was doomed to be a slow knitter when I was first starting out. I still plan on tackling continental knitting for other reasons but for any other currently new knitters ignore that statement!!!  You are perfectly fine knitting English and are capable of knitting just as fast if not faster than continental... Of course speed doesnt matter as long as you are having fun. And English knitters can learn to flick as well which speeds up the process a lot if you want to try and knit fast.,knitting,ckjk3h0,4,t5_2qiu0

Their brick and mortar shop is even nice I went when I was in the northeast earlier this year.Little Knits has some great sales where you can get a bag of yarn usually  skeins for cheap. If you keep your eyes peeled you can get some really good deals.Jimmy Beans is also good place for sale yarns. their photos are great too. Everyone I know who has been a customer has been a repeat customer.When you look at yarn make sure to look at the size of skein and compare apples to apples. I personally dont like Knit Picks because their yarn seems cheap but the skeins are generally  grams and most projects that I like need  grams or more of yarn and when you multiply their prices by  theyre not as cheap as they seem. Their yarn unless its changed drastically in the last few months was disappointing to me too with multiple knots and dye lots that didnt match themselves and dye that rubbed off on my needles. That and g skeins make it so that you have to weave in twice as many ends.,knitting,ckklcqg,3,t5_2qiu0

Lets get a list started here and then maybe expand it into a wiki article?  Meanwhile OP do go post on knitrequest.  But you know what? Maybe you and your friend might want to learn to knit together?

And then its going to drop off  as it needs to really but still.Maybe you and your friend could make a regular thing out of knitting together and she could use the time to talk about her mom after the initial phase is over and she starts to feel like shes expected to be over it a little more.If you two wanted to hang out here for help learning or if you wanted to get started and later teach her when its not so new and raw youll find plenty of help right here.  ,knitting,clmvnbc,13,t5_2qiu0

2283416,0,t3_2ld7oc,Currently I am working oninn in neon alafosslopi and its amazing. I am going to have a ton of yarn leftover the yoke sleeves and  the body are done and Im only into the rd skein of the  I bought in the main colour so I might be able to swing a nd more fitted sweater out of it. Continuing in my lopi obsession I finally cut the steek on my Riddari on the weekend so I just have to find and install a zipper. I started the Westknits MKAL and its not going well. I love the first clue Im just having yarn problems. The first pics with the purple yarn have been frogged the purple yarn is dyeing my hands hot pink as Im knitting....despite the fact that its been INTENSIVELY prewashed. So I subbed in some Tosh Mo Light in Leaf but I dont like how much white is in it compared to the other colours Im using. So Im going yarn shopping later. Im also working on another Stephen West shawl Zoolandia which is not a superexciting knit but good for commuting and will probably be a wardrobe staple this winterspring.Finally I have a pair of socks on the go Feny which are knit sideways with mosaic colourwork and are being kind of neglected in favour of all the stuff listed above.Oh yeah and I might start another sweater for NaKniSweMo because I clearly have no sense of restraint. I have  more sweater wips in partial hibernation that I didnt include here due to lack of pictures.

If you Google for knitting lifeline there are very clear pics of what Im talking about. Then try out your stitch technique just knitting normally and pretending the lifeline isnt there.

2409825,0,t3_2n1lsv,Also assuming youre using the same size loom regardless of the type of yarn you can imagine that the thinner yarn would be like a bunch of thin rings interlinked while the thicker yarn would be a bunch of rings of the same diameter but much thicker in width. The thinner rings would have much more space to move around and stretchadjust when you pull on it while the thicker rings would kind of just... get caught on each other if that makes sense. There are so many different variables that it will be difficult imo to create a comprehensive chart. However the few things that you can consider when deciding if something will have stretchgive is  the sizespacing of your loom relative to your yarn  the makeup of your yarn the inherent stretch of the material and the way its spun and if you move on to use needles  the type of stitch you use. Hope that helps. ,knitting,cm9kaku,4,t5_2qiu0

If I was taking on this endeavor I would get a bigger size of needles something like mm and then get a nice yarn so I could just bang out with a couple inches of rib and a knit stitch. Depending on whether you are working in circulars or straight needles knitting every row will give you a nice stockinet the and garter stitch that will look good with a nice yarn. Keep the pattern simple. You can even make up your own using size measurements found on the Internet and a gauge swatch. This is my favorite method. Make a gauge swatch by casting on fifteen stitches or more and knitting a couple inches. If you are doing a ribbed brim and a stockinette you can use the same casting to size it. Multiply the width of the swatch to how wide you want it to be using a size chart. This site is good but warning the preemie sizes made me cry.  ,knitting,cmfnz61,5,t5_2qiu0

2494122,0,t3_2o3p2z,There is a link to the gift giving guide at the top of this sub! For a new knitter Id suggest  a set of knitting needles  circular  inch or  inch or a set of straight needles. You can get large sets for cheap on ebay  please note that these are NOT super nice sets but they work and a beginner can get a set of different sizes without feeling super committed because of how much they spent on needles. I recently got a friend of mine who is getting into knitting a set of  circular needles in different sizes for  on ebay yarn obviously. Cascade  is a good yarn thats not too expensive comes in a wide variety of colors is  wool and is easy to knit with  it wont unwind itself pill or be hard to see the stitches on the needles Stitch n Bitch is a good starter book. It has patterns ranging from easy to hard and is a good starting place. However I think learning from a person or even from YouTube videos helped me a lot more than a book. small tool set including stitch markers tape measure not like a hardware one though darning needles small scissors and a zippered case to keep them in.I would say not to worry about patterns because there are SO many free ones on Ravelry.com.,knitting,cmk4bmz,3,t5_2qiu0

THE BEST.It can be annoying if youre reading a pattern that specifically refers to DPNs with references to do this on the first needle do this on the second needle. I generally only find this with free patterns. Its worth it to take a bit of time beforehand to translate the pattern to be read based on the number of stitches in the round instead of on the needle. Or if you like using stitch markers you could place one at each end of the DPN and follow that way.,knitting,cmynnsj,2,t5_2qiu0

In my opinion more drape works just dandy in a cowl but you know your own preferences.  Have you swatched in a cable pattern with the alpacasilk? That should help answer your gauge question. Once you decide whether you prefer the gauge with the patterns original needle size a smaller one or something in between then youll be able to do all the fun knitting math to see whether you want to make it longer or what have you. ,knitting,cn1zz5c,5,t5_2qiu0

You knit one stitch this is your selvedge and now you have one stitch on your right needle and  stitches on the left needle. Then you wrap the yarn once around the right needle. Now you have two stitches on the right needle even though ones not a proper stitch its just the yarn wrapped around and  stitches on the left needle. Then you knit the next two stitches together as a normal ktog. Now you have  stitches on the right needle and  stitches on the left needle. Then you YO  wrap it  again leaving you with  stitches on the right needle and  stitches on the left needle.

At least Ive personally found that if you have a scarf it needs to be almost entirely noncurling fabric for it to not curl. The edges most likely didnt curl  but as the scarf is a long and narrow strip of fabric the entire thing curled Im guessing? In those cases the options would probably be to a line it b doubleknit it not easy with lace or c tube it.

I dont know if is the colors or the simple uniformity of the thing but it is very calming to look at the pictures. It may be strange but Ive been trying to figure out what makes it so appealing to me.  The closest thing I can equate to it is that it is a knitted version of Shaker style furniture.

2867631,0,t3_2sxo2y,Last night I couldnt get to sleep and then once I did I dreamt for about a week.  And it was so believable that this morning I  had to confirm that a couple celebrities were actually still alive and had not killed themselves.  It not like I was super emotionally involved with these people just that it was the major news item going around. And part of not going to sleep was thinking about a project with no pattern I am going to work on next and my mind getting wrapped up in the how to do it part.  ,knitting,cnu1twq,3,t5_2qiu0
2868756,0,t3_2sywds,. Id definitely recommend doing it so that you have one colour on one side and the other on the other side. That way youll have way less issues with having to carry floats and it should generally be easier to do. . Wrong side appearance. Well if you dont carry floats and weave the ends in nicely itll look decent. Cheeseis suggested doubleknitting and while that would literally double the amount of knitting to be done and amount of yarn required it would make for an awesome reversible blanket. . This will depends on how much youve knit how much time you have to knit per day and your knitting technique how fast you knit. If youre relatively confident in your knitting skills if you knit a bit every day its totally doable even double knit. Do the math. Determine your gauge stitches x rows per  cm in determine how big of a blanket you want to make calculate the number of rows required to achieve that based on your gauge. Calculate the number of days you have until it needs to be finished and calculate how many rows per day you need to knit to achieve that. . Cotton would be easy to care for however cotton grows. As in once it stretches it wont unstretch. Id recommend against  cotton in a project like this and instead recommend wool woolwool or merinowool not alpacawool nylon and acrylic as possible materials or cotton in combination with any of the ones mentioned before. Wool always carries a risk of felting when washing less so if its superwash andor in combination with other fibres. Wool breathes well and its warm however a blanketsize batch of wool will also cost you a fair bit. Nylon is usually used to give other materials strength. Acrylic is cheaper than wool and carries no risk of felting but doesnt breathe or insulate as well. Wool and acrylic have a bit of stretch to them that cotton doesnt have that makes knitting them a lot easier and the end result often a fair bit smoother. Cotton is relatively inexpensive and carries no risk of felting however it doesnt insulate well and it doesnt have any stretch.. Thats one way to do it. I know there are some websites that will do that for you havent got any bookmarked though. ,knitting,cnu6fqt,6,t5_2qiu0

I use that for socks mittens gloves etc.  If Im making things two at a time I use .DPNs arent something that you have to learn how to use but as with so many things its a good skill to attempt just so you KNOW that you are using the method you prefer.  I know knitters who swear by DPNs and others like me who greatly prefer ML.  But Ill use DPNs for things like the tops of hats usually because Im using  circulars which are too short for ML but I dont feel like switching the cable length!Seriously though its good to learn new things.

I found a useful little list for you The Standard Yarn Weight System Handy Chart  It has WPI gauge and yards per pound.I know the ball band of various yarns will tell you what its supposed to work up at with a certain size of needles. However what it says and what you actually do can be wildly divergent. Thats one of the reasons you swatch. The label may say  SPI with size  needles. You may knit . with s. Then you need to adjust usually by using a different size needle. Most likely if you drop down to a  youll be at gauge.Also you dont always knit the same yard to the same gauge. If youre making a shawl with sock yarn you can knit it looser in bigger loops and fewer SPI. If youre making socks with it you need to make small stitches because those make the sock take less damage from wear and it will last longer. I just had to do that with a pair of socks I made in this wonderful yarn. I didnt knit it tightly enough and the toes and heels wore down to tissue paper in only a couple years. Much sadness.WPI is a better measure for figuring out the weight. Just remember to be consistent and to wind the yarn so each wrap is snug to the one next to it. WPI is still prone to a lot of error because everyone wraps with different distance between the yarn. Yeah youre not supposed to have any distance between them but try an experiment. Wrap some yarn around a ruler. Then squish the wraps tigher together with your fingers. Which one is the correct density?The best method is by weight. Measure off ten yards and weigh it. Use the values on that chart to figure out what weight you have. Also if youve lost the ballband or you only have a partial skein you can figure out how many yards you have total.There are no dumb questions and if there were I would like answering them because it makes me feel smart.,knitting,cos9qoj,3,t5_2qiu0
3196263,0,t1_coszdzi,Its both decorative and has a purpose too. Its like a regular bowl except it usually has a few holes on the side and an open slice down the side often in a very decorative manner. The idea is to keep the ball of yarn in the bowl where it can happily roll around while knitting instead of it rolling around on the floor or on the couch or elsewhere. If theres pets in the house its an easy way to lessen the number of animal hairs that gets in the yarn too. ,knitting,cotajl8,3,t5_2qiu0

I have so many patterns saved and not enough time to do them. Just surfing those pictures... drools like Homer I get so many ideas. There are threads where they post sale patterns and patterns that you can get for free I went bonkers one day and bought like  lace shawl patterns. Never mind that I had never knit lace and was terrified to do it. I just finished a shawl that I started a year ago. That got me inspired to knit another lace shawl...well technically I started it like  years ago and just havent gotten it right. I just frogged it and started over.

They ride around the needles with the stitches and help you keep track.Tapestry needle Big needle with a large hole to thread yarn through and used to weave in the ends of your project so it wont unravel.Stitch holders Used to hold live stitches when they arent on the needles like the thumb stitches when you are finishing up the top of the fingers on glovesmittens.

I have to add  stitches to the top of the sock before turning the heel or its too tight to wear.From what Ive learned so far about  years knitting socks now you really dont have to have a pattern if you know the parts of the sock and how to put em together.The only downside to big feet?

Note keep as closely to the pattern of decreases it asks for as you can.If you get to what you think is the last decrease round and you have  for example then just evenly decrease the last  stitches  every  st and youll be fine. Ktog for knits ptog for purls. Once your stitch count is caught up move on to the next section.  jenIt will work out I absolutely promise.,knitting,csnudiu,2,t5_2qiu0

4449012,0,t3_3c0yl1,Kismet fiber works has some locally madethe just released an organic  American local alpaca family of yarns. Some of their other lines are also locally Virgina sourced.Knitspot makes Bare Naked wools which are regionally sourced and spun I think some blends arent  American made because the non animal fiber in some isnt available locally?. But its pretty close and they do note on each yarn if its  American made or notI cant think of any others at the moment but thought you might like these two.ETA I have some Kismet yarn which I love but have not tried their new line.

4470524,0,t3_3cawjz,I got a new cat last Wednesday! So far its not going too bad introducing her to my boyfriends two dogs and cat. She doesnt like them bothering her but as long as they leave her alone which they do anyway with any cats shes fine. She really likes being petted but she does not like being picked up at all. Shes also being picky about what she wants to eat right now but Im sure once she gets adjusted everything will be fine. Shes front declawed which I think is what makes her a little nervous around other animals and I think that has something to do with why she doesnt like the other animals around her.  But anyway hopefully this link will work and you can see some pictures of her!On the knitting front Im not doing too well with the tourdesock. I had a lot more time to knit during the beginning of it and Im having less and less time now. Hopefully I can do ok with this stage buuuut its not looking too good.

Knitting flat can be different than knitting round if you mount your stitches differently than normal.

4956428,0,t1_cujahaa,gt I think I need the visual. Makes sense.  I do the increase  to a row on each side every other row.  I like the taper that gives.  But its not  necessary to do it like that though I wouldnt increase all in the same row.But if its confusing for you right now theres no need to bother with it.  Depending on how tightlyloosely you knit you may not need to mess with the needle size much on the Pearls Longies to get the gauge you need usually with smaller yarn youll need to go up a needle size the reason I suggested the others is that if you are using these as an actual cloth diaper cover you dont want the material to be too thin and that can happen fairly easily with going up too many sizes.  Some DK yarn is essentially sport weight and some is closer to worsted weight so in the end much depends on the exact yarn and how much you have to change the needle to get it.  Do a gauge swatch in the needle size given in the pattern first always.  Ive noticed Im a much looser knitter than a lot of pattern writers so if you are too you may be able to get gauge without changing anything.  ,knitting,cujaqnb,2,t5_2qiu0

If they had a solid grey or white available in addition to the other solid colors Im not a big fan of variegated this would be a strong contender.Madtosh DK  a bit too pricey for me. Id love to try the yarn out though. One day!Sirdar  definitely fits my budget. My concern is it wont be too warm though. Aunty will have a lace hat for fall already knit up just needs blocking I want to knit a warmer one for winter.Rowan  I cant find the DK on WEBS but I do see the Aran weight. Good contender. Might be a little spendy though for the budgetstrapped  I see its light on yardage.Couple suggestions for you and others I ordered a couple other yarns along with the Silky Wool and I really like how they feel.Knit One Crochet Too  Sebago. Very soft. Feels like it might pill easily but should be fine for a hat. Label on the hank says the gauge is Light  but it looks more like DK or light Worsted. Muted colorways though.Mirasol Nuna Fina. OMG. Feels so nice in my hands. Definitely gives KPs Gloss  a run for its money. Unfortunately limited colorways on WEBS.

I like it when it is either on smaller needles or sometimes on bigger needles than the yarn calls for but it doesnt always look as nice to me when using normal sized needles for that yarn weight.

5317858,0,t3_3nteak,Bamboo rayon behaves similarly to silk.  It is limp shiny and drapes well.  At  the yarn will be a lot shinier will hang and drape more limply often preferable for clothing and have less sproing or puffiness than  wool.  Bamboo will take away some of the coziness the loft and crimp in wool creates so that could be really good for this garment.  Bamboo rayon looks silky but doesnt always feel all that soft some can feel sort of grippy and dry similar to some silks and tends to help wool relax and be less crimpysproingylofty.  It usually slides around great on needles but I find it driesroughs up my fingers a bit like cotton when I knit with it a lot.  I have a yarn base thats  merino  bamboo and  nylon and than  of bamboo is enough to make the yarn noticeably dryingrough to my finger tips I get little rough patches similar to unmercerized kitchen cotton... so if you dont like knitting with cotton this may potentially be a similar feeling.  its the only base I have ever been told by a customer they thought it would be softer and found it a bit of a rough knit.  The finished object felt soft but the yarn doesnt feel soft or luxurious in your hand if that makes sense.  Do you have the option to get samples or anything?  It would be a shame to spend a bunch of money on yarn you might not enjoy knitting with.  I think it could be the perfect choice if shine and drape is what you are looking for but am a bit concerned you might not find it all that pleasant to work with.,knitting,cvrf2zh,4,t5_2qiu0

My solution would be to hold it double and look for patterns in the  meter range.Here is a Ravelry Search for Cowl paterns written for super bulky meters.   Do any of these fit the bill?NB you will have to swatch bulky held double is not the same as superbulky. It might be a bit thicker.

Heres my Ravelry project page if youre interested I really want to try KnitPicks but live in a country that they dont ship to and has appalling local yarn stores x the price as online nothing is in English only very basic needles and all the yarn is kept in clear plastic bags so you cant feel it until youve bought it. However Im visiting Australia in the next couple of months so will make an order to there that I can pick up! Im planning on getting fingering in Chroma Stroll and Hawthorne sport in Hawthorne again and Swish in DK as well as some Curio thread to try with lace crochet.Currently Im having to justify international shipping from shops like WEBS and Deramores by making large orders which essentially requires a ton of blind buying which I hate hence why I wanted to know what youd recommend.

Im still trying to finish socks for my husband by his birthdayvalentines day except that hes got an interview later this week so maybe I can knock them out before then? well be celebrating this weekend anyway to avoid all of the people so if Im already moving the gift up a week whats another couple of days! I also found out recently that one of my old coworkers is due by the end of this month so Im going to make the babe a small Gryffindor blanket which I conveniently have yarn for in my stash! I think planning ahead is really going to help me with Cold Sheep so about halfway through the blanket Ill start thinking about my next couple of projects that way I can suss out my yarn.,knitting,czkz61u,2,t5_2qiu0

Just a well stocked pantry lots of spare bottled water and some go bags with copies of important documents etc. And really...I could easilly pass my yarn off as a prep item. Not only is it a moral boost for when times are so lean we have to bust into said pantry but as you said also highly practical! Especially considering we live in Ohio where winters can be tough. Always a need for extra gloves and hats and scarfs! Youve convinced me its totally practical!

6565102,0,t3_45cspk,Cant comment on what coveted lovely luxury yarns might be appropriate for you to look into but I want to propose another possible leg for your businessA basic bogstandard but locally hard to get typebrand of yarn. At a competitive price.The thinking here is that a boring yarn complements a luxury yarn in a bigger project gt extra sale. OR some customers like me are easily drawn in by a good value and then fall for the luxury stuff too gt also an additional sale.Like a typical German thin sock yarn but not Regia or one of the other big brands. One I personally like is WolleRdel nothing exciting per se but very good value so I always stock up when I am in Germany.Over here Im in Finland most basic yarns are made either in Norway or Turkey whatever the country of the company on the label so those might be countries of origin worth looking into. For some reason I cant remember a single name of a Norwegian manufacturer right now but a few big Turkish brands are Nako Alize and Madame Tricote. Lots of acrylic and novelty crap in the Turkish lines but also some good basics at very competitive prices the quality of a few different mohairangora blends Ive tried have been quite good. The problem generally for small specialised shops is to find a way of selling a large enough range of products without directly having to compete with giants  thats a competition you can never win already because of logistics. Loads of places sell Malabrigo or Regia what you need to find is the equivalent same or better quality without the brand name and at a price that you can sell it and make your customers happy.Oh heres another idea the Estonian very long repeat wools from Aade Long I think those are sold as Kauni in some places. Probably not easy to find in the US. Especially not the monocolours. ,knitting,czydwq9,1,t5_2qiu0
6586723,0,t1_czzt7ho,Let me introduce you to another aunty! Well she looks like a lovable aunty anyway. Oftroys Golden Apples is a website full of lists and categories for knitting knowledge  I have linked you directly to Stretchy Bind Offs but do look around more.  She usually gives links and often has made videos of the technique but she is still working on this page.I use the one called Miraculous Stretch Bind Off for good stretch and ease of working. Many people swear by Elizabeth Zimmermanns Sewn Biind Off but I am more likely to swear at it  slow to do and even slower to undo if you make a mistake you cant live with. If you want to try it be careful to work it loosely  the stretch comes from having extra yarn in there.       For a very quick and easy slightly stretchy one I now enjoy using  the Modified Conventional Bind Off by Lucy Neatby.  I suggest swatching it with slightly bigger needles than you were knitting with.,knitting,d00md18,1,t5_2qiu0

I wanted to try as many different things as possible so I try and take on a new technique on every project. Some of them didnt turn out great but the beauty of knitting is that you tend to have to do the same thing over and over again in a project and by the end you BECOME good at it at least competent.I also started knitting because I wanted to make sweaters but discovered that I enjoy lace mostly in shawls and cowls. Brioche is the hotness right now so maybe Ill make a brioche sweater and that will rekindle my fondness for that? Anyway thats all driven my search for more advanced stitches and construction. Pick something and swatch it out or take on a new project in a garmentaccessory you havent made yet etc. Just challenge yourself  there isnt really a next step where you are theres just everything else you dont already know.,knitting,d0zu31u,1,t5_2qiu0

6937498,0,t1_d128mom,OK because I couldnt find a good explanations online... Heres an example of the same pattern twice  Apologies in advance if I got some of the individual boxes wrong I dont write patterns often. The yellow is just for reference those are equivalent stitches on the left and right patterns. The left side has shaded no stitch boxes. The right side is exactly the same except I took out the no stitch boxes. A stitch is created with a yarn over O and decreased with a knit  together  but you cant represent that perfectly on a graph. No stitch means that theres nothing to slip or anything it just skips to the next stitch. On patterns the purpose of the no stitch box is so that you can see how two rows will look like together after you work them. Otherwise because youre adding or taking out stitches they wont line up right on the graph. The knitting and purling gets all wonky on the right.,knitting,d12oymx,2,t5_2qiu0

7196290,0,t3_4dyk29,Do not join  work it flat back and forth in rows.Some patterns define the wrong side WS and right side RS for you like this  Cast on  st.  Row  RS K ktog yo.  Row  and all WS rows Purl across.Your pattern tells you which is the RS up there where it say Working back and forth across needle in rows proceed as follows  Knit  rows garter st noting first row is WS.A good trick at the beginning is to note where your yarn tail is right after you cast on.  If you used the longtail cast on your tail will be at the top of your needle.  Knit your first row and the tail is at the bottom  Knit your second row and the tail is at the top.So for your pattern assuming longtail caston WS is row  because the pattern tells you so.  Whenever you are holding your work to start a WS row your tail will be at the top.Another good trick after you have made some fabric is to put a safety pin onto the right side of the work.,knitting,d1w5qx2,2,t5_2qiu0

7265768,0,t3_4esmkp,I love everything about knitting its really been more than a hobby. I dont have any extraordinary talents. I dont play instruments more than dabbling I write shitty poetry and crappy books and my cooking is just OK. But knitting I am great at! I have never had that feeling of This is out of my skill level. when knitting. Ive always had a knack for it and that makes me proud of myself. Its insanity to nonknitters. I make a lot of plain stockinette beanies to wear during winter so I always have one within reach. But if someone compliments my beanie I say Thank you I made it myself! they always stop me and go WHAT. YOU MADE THAT?! Like you sewed it? No I knit it myself. Whaaaaaaaat! Thats amazing! and that feels so good to hear. You can make whatever you want in whatever colors fibers or sizes you want. You can make a million of them. Who cares?! Theyre yours!TLDRBut the most fulfilling thing for me about knitting is being able to put all of my love into an object for someone. I gave my MIL a shawl before she went into the hospital and I said Take this with you and know that its a portable hug from me.  Or putting all my anger into an object. Then you finish and let it go. You give it away to a better home. I think this is how cursed objects are made though.  Lastly sad times. Pouring your tears into a project. Hugging it to your face talking to it. Then when its finished you can give it away to let go of something or keep it to remind you of someone you loved.Maybe Im just crazy though.,knitting,d242f2s,5,t5_2qiu0

Doing that cast on might help if your problem is that the edge is not stretchy enough. If your problem is that the cast on stitches are too tight to knit into then just be very conscientious about not pulling your stitches tight after you work them thats what I find makes my knitting tight. Practice casting on super loosely barely regulating the tightness and then keep practicing while regulating it more and more so that you can keep the stitches loose but uniform,knitting,d2o6ms7,7,t5_2qiu0

Im guessing that thats what happened because it looks like x rib and you have  stitches of stockinette above two purls meaning you increased  stitch.  You have a couple options. Drop the stitch unraveling the four stitches above the yarn over. This will result in uneven tension which you can try to alleviate by tugging on nearby stitches.. Frog or tink back to the yarn over. This will be cleaner but will take more work.,knitting,d2rp08e,14,t5_2qiu0

I am left handed but knit English with the yarn in my right hand. uFatKittyEats is left handed and knits Continental with the yarn in their left hand. So youre going to hear from two lefties but we knit differently so hopefully one of us can be of some help!I wrap my yarn around my pinkie finger to help regulate tension. I do this when doing knit or purl but I find it much more necessary during purling.I dont physically move my right pointer finger when purling I use my left hand to hook the needle around the yarn that has a consistent tension on my right hand. I found if I move my right hand the tension is off.as for videos the best thing you can do is to just google purling videos and see what kind of method works the best for you. it might just take time. You can make some dishtowels to just figure it out while you regulate your method. ,knitting,d67iaen,4,t5_2qiu0

The blanket is basically in a stockinette stitch with seed stitch border. I knit it in a round to give it even tension and between the border I k to define the border. I thought I planned ahead well enough but probably not... Im preparing to steek the blanket but Ive been doing some practice with steeking on smaller pieces and theyve been unsuccessful. Ive uploaded some pictures to let you see what Im dealing with such as why are there double threads to be snipped when I feel like all of the videos Ive watched it should be just one? Is it even possible to steek with seed stitch anything is possible right? D? Should I have planned to have had k between the seed stitch to be more successful? What can I do? Please help! This is my first time ever steeking a project and I am nervous as hell. Especially since this blanket was such an endeavor. Any advice would be wonderful! Thanks!Edit I figured it out!!

That is the only time you will put any stitches onto the holders. You will ignore those stitches and their holders for awhile after that.So on the row after you put the stitches onto the holders you will continue in stockinette knitting one row and purling the next.  Every time you get to a knit row do your decrease at each end.Then youll purl a row with no decreases.Repeat that until youve done those two rows a total of  times the time it was written out for you to do plus the instructions to repeat them  MORE times.

Youtube has a lot of tutorials that list the steps involved out loud otherwise sites like Ravelry and Redheart have downloadable patterns that can be read with a texttospeech program although the shorthand for some of the stitches might get a little garbled.There are tons of teach myself to knit kits at craft stores but you might look in to just purchasing the necessary materials and start with videos since the illustrations in the beginner books arent always intuitive.If you can find a local club or mentor to help guide you while you get started it will prevent a lot of silly mistakes early on and keep you on track to learning proper technique.Good luck!

9244928,0,t3_56yz7r,Looks like someone else has found the CO you were looking for. As for the stitch slipping the default is to slip the stitch as if youre about to purl it. This keeps the stitchs orientation the same when it moves to the next needle. When you slip as if to knit it twists the stitch. Sometimes this is what you want e.g. when doing a slip slip knit to get a left leaning decrease but when youre just rearranging stitches or if the pattern says to slip the stitch but doesnt specify how purlwise is the way to go.As for keeping the tension consistent Im not sure how to help beyond suggesting that you try not to yank on the stitches too much when you slip them. You could also manually rearrange the tension to make it more even after youve done all the slipping. Sorry I dont have a better trick!,knitting,d8nv1jj,4,t5_2qiu0

What you see is what you get with cotton  beyond initial stretching when wet. You can wash cotton on HOT and generally treat it mean and it will hold up  I have a cotton dishcloth in an open lace pattern that is going strong years later. Kitchen cotton is  ply and tough usually worseted. Sugar n Cream is the brand you find at Michaels and other such stores.

9556189,0,t3_5bsyad,Look up continental combined knitting. Its a way to make your knit stitches the way you do making sure your stitches arent twisted. Im assuming youre making your knits through the back loop. Some people like combined knitting because the way you wrap the stitches can make purling easier. Its all preference.I knit continental for the same reason you do and when I started I made my knit stitches the way you do too. It can get confusing with certain decreases like ktog which is always done through the back loops. Instead of learning combined knitting I just started making my knits the right way.

9868315,0,t3_5gom5e,For seed stitch the easiest way to know what to do is just look at your knitting. So if youre working the next row knit the opposite of what you see. So if the next stitch on your left needle appears to be a purl then you would knit it. If it appears to be a knit you would purl it. If you havent yet tackled learning how to tell stitches apart ie which ones are purls and which are knits I highly recommend looking that up first!,knitting,datv4ey,3,t5_2qiu0

10266124,0,t3_5n0bww,Okay so  basically what youre doing here is decreasing one stitch for every four in the pattern. Youre starting with a KP pattern round and by the end of the round will have a KP pattern round. I would follow your knitting around and see if it follows the KP pattern where it should or if you accidentally did a few too many decreases. If you post a picture we can look at it too and see if we can spot any mistakes. You can also just tink back that round and get back to the previous  stitch round and try it again and make sure youre getting the decrease pattern right. Thats what youll need to do anyway to fix the mistake so you dont necessarily HAVE to figure out where it happened but it can be helpful so you dont repeat the same mistake. ,knitting,dc7pz1x,3,t5_2qiu0

When I went to try it on I discovered it was a tanktop fused to white sleeves and collar. Not what I wanted at all! So I had a brainwave and went to Oxfam. I knew there had to be a  tanktop pattern from the s in there somewhere and indeed there was! So that was how I learned.

10647154,0,t3_5s7ei9,The being righthanded thing is most likely not the cause of you finding this difficult. Im right handed and knit continental yarn in my left hand and my friend is strongly lefthanded and knits mirrored continental yarn in right hand. Its a muscle memory thing. Its also largely a myth that continental is faster. Im faster at continental because Ive been knitting that way for  years and only started to learn english for the sake of fair isle a few months ago. But Im nowhere near as fast as the Yarn Harlot and she knits english style. If you want to learn continental which I recommend you to do either way because learning new stuff is good for you try knitting lots and lots of swatches. Preferably in ribbing or stockinette to get that purl down as well. Experiment with different ways of wrapping your yarn around your fingers for each swatch. Depending on the yarn Im using I can tension it by just running it under my pinky over my ring under my middle and over my pointer or Ill have to wrap it once around my ring finger and once around my pointer. ,knitting,dde67cl,2,t5_2qiu0

Id definitely address those issues with their customer support.But about the shipping speedgt  twoday shipping  is a bit much esp considering it took them four days to process the order.I think weve gotten a little spoiled by the big box companies like Zon who have the resources to process orders very quickly. When I order stuff from smaller companies it often does take  days for them to process my orders. Their system arent as highly automated and it takes time and manpower to pull things off the shelves doublecheck the order package them and get them ready to ship. Then depending on the companys setup they have to either wait for a shipper to come pick it up or send someone to a shipping facility. To keep expenses in control this is likely to be clear Im speculating here based on my experience w small biz done a handful of times each day rather than a constant bytheminute basis. ,knitting,de61v4x,26,t5_2qiu0

Of course my stash is too big for that to be a reality but at least the FOs are stacked well enough that I could put them on my lap as I pull the bird cage through the door.

The colors are great together and I love that Dale yarn.Just looking at what I have saved in my library you could do these booties again replacing the cable with the one from the cardi. The Dale yarn will be a little big but if you make the newborn size it should be OK. And you can probably add the same cable to almost any baby mittens. These use the right size yarn but theyre for a  month old baby so they might be a bit big. Of course itll be hard to fit the same cable on smaller mittens so instead you could just do plain brown mittens that would also be adorable.,knitting,depg32d,5,t5_2qiu0

If you knit with handdyed stuff a lot it may be worth getting a small bottle of synthropol too though its pretty harsh and you wont want to use it on super nice yarn.

11434586,0,t3_637004,Happy Monday! Life is busy busy busy and Im neglecting my knitting horribly. Ive started a dog sweater and thats the only thing Ive touched over the last month or so. Im a little worried as its alpaca and I think it might be an insideonly sweater so I can take a while to finish it by NEXT winter... which is about accurate at my rate of knitting. I want to try and make time for it but I think Im trying to do to many things....,knitting,dfs3kll,3,t5_2qiu0
11436172,0,t3_637004,So Im currently working on a baby blanket for a friend whos only about  weeks pregnant and then up pops an announcement from my MIL that my SOs cousin just had a baby. Im feeling like I should probably knit something for this baby as well but I want something quick since this other blanket is pretty timeconsuming. Thinking booties hat maybe a sweater etc. Any suggestions of good patterns? Im an intermediate level knitter just did my first socks a month ago but Im pretty good at reading patterns.,knitting,dfsa1rm,3,t5_2qiu0
11438648,0,t1_dfrnd1k,I just got some karbonz sock needles cause I was using some cheapo bamboo ones and was sure I was going to break one. I didnt want metal cause I thought it would be too slippery and all my other needles are wood.

11486081,0,t1_dfxxayn,You have the knit stitch correct. However with the purl stitch you are supposed to wrap the yarn from the top to the bottom. If you wrap a purl stitch from the bottom to the top you are twisting the stitch hence why it looks different. It took me an embarrassing  years of knitting before I realized I was doing my purl stitches wrong!,knitting,dfxy21q,2,t5_2qiu0

I havent done much with the website only because my wordpress login is broken and Ive been using Clef which is shutting down but thats been a low priority to fix with  some odd IKEA shelves to build and  box of yarn to get into inventory.

11523288,0,t1_dg1es9u,Not sure about that one but since its just the sleeves you could always fudge it and use an icord! ,knitting,dg260ae,2,t5_2qiu0
11526437,0,t3_64iszt,If that doesnt work you would have to do some mathing to figure out how to adjust the number of stitches that you cast on. Sometimes it works to make a larger or smaller size of the garment than your actual size because of the gauge difference. But Im not an expert in that Im sure someone else will come along and explain it. ,knitting,dg2iuq5,2,t5_2qiu0

11735369,0,t3_67gra9,I have a knitpicks interchangeable wooden needle set I bought almost  years ago that is becoming problematic. Mostly the wood parts of some of the needles are separating from the metal base and some cords cant be tightened anymore. Ive only used it probably a dozen times or so so this is pretty frustrating. Do you think this is a one off or have any of you noticed the same problems with this set? Im thinking maybe bc its so inexpensive its just not meant to last as long? ,knitting,dgq8fdk,5,t5_2qiu0

Im a relatively new knitter less than a year but im crazy and ive made sweatersocks etc etc and they were very helpful about yarn knowledge sheep knowledge one of the ladies keeps some they have spin nights im told they carry lopi etc etc. I was really impressed and felt very welcome so Id recommend them to anyone my local shop isnt as welcoming so worth the drive for me.

11788027,0,t3_6872hd,Finally finished the Mens Spring Knitting Retreat Color Challenge shawl! The pattern is Seussafrabical on Ravelry. The color challenge was to draw  random crayons and then use the colors you drew to make something. Black or white could be added as a neutral.My colors were denim magenta with a bit of a mind flip... wild strawberry and yellow orange. As an additional challenge I tried to use yarns already in my stash. I ended up fudging a little. The magenta yarn was a gradient also incorporating the denim and yielding a few other colors along the way. I didnt have a fullon yellow orange but I did have the yellow yarn instead. The only changes to the pattern were altering the number of rows before switching yarns reducing the repeats of the border and using an icord bind off instead of the suggested bobble border. I also added a single crochet edging on the other borders of the shawl to help camouflage ends and to provide a finishing touch.Yarns used Knit Picks Chroma in Lupine and in black Anne Geddes baby yarn in marigoldI think thats the color. Lost the label and black a red Berocco alpaca yarn missing label again and a malabrigo alpaca yarn in tonal blues missing labelWith the points draped over my shoulders and touching my waistline the shawl hangs down to the back of my knees.,knitting,dgw7niz,6,t5_2qiu0
11805314,0,t3_68eyj5,A cardigan or a vest against indoor air conditioning is an option.  Even in sock yarn merino it wont be too heavy.Another thought is that summer is a good time to knit winter wear and gifts.  And socks you always need socks.  I always knit for the next season so I dont have to wait a whole year to wear my FO.  So yeah I am just now finishing up my summer knitting and will start on winter wear and holiday gifts soon.,knitting,dgy68s2,3,t5_2qiu0
