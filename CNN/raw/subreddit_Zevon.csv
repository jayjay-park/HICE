1300328,0,t1_cifjt91,Another book worth picking up is Lawyers Guns and Photos by George Gruel.  Its sort of a coffeetable book with a ton of great unreleased behindthescene photos from George Gruels time touring with Warren Zevon  You might recognize George Gruels name from Poor Poor Pitiful Me on Stand in the Fire  I said Wheres George Gruel my road manger and best friendCome on out here George...Get up and danceGet up and dance or Ill kill you and I got the means,Zevon,cifwjhc,2,t5_2udbz

One novel unfortunately I cant remember the title used a Zevon song for each chapter.I guess it makes sense given the fact that WZ was steeped in the literary world and was himself such an original influential talent. As Jackson Browne said Warren didnt have literary pretenstions. He had literary muscle.,Zevon,clyb2f7,2,t5_2udbz
