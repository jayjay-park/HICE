With one image swap it could be for soap jewelry soda vlog lets play unboxing dramatic smut reading ANYTHING really. You need something unique that tells viewers INSTANTLY what your channel is about. This is ten seconds of generic techno a cool loading cg effect and a static image. Not even a channel or episode title. Look at Game Grumps or Extra Credits think about how Markiplier and Pewdiepie start every video with that same iconic pitch. It seems THEM. It sells their CONTENT. And its unique!

2193283,0,t3_2k7ge5,Hello I havent seem your old trailer so Im just commenting on this one. Ill be honest the screams were a little piercing on my ears. Screams can be great but either they were simply too loud or your microphone isnt picking them up cleanly. The visuals were good so you obviously have the gear for capturing the game footage which is great!It wasnt completely clear what your new channel is about on the trailer alone. Perhaps as well as having clips of what youre doing it would be worth adding the word commentary somewhere in the video itself. The trailer seemed a little long to me  I think you could condense a lot of it down into  seconds leaving it snappy sweet and keeping the viewer wanting more.I hope there is something here you can use  Feel free to discard what Ive said! ,youtubers,climcb7,1,t5_2sj81

2382029,0,t3_2mocp0,Hey again Frigid!Your quality is quite good. Looks sharp in p and the audio levels balanced well in my opinion didnt have to adjust throughout the video.Now that your recording quality is set the next thing youll want to tackle is commentary. It can be quite difficult but try your hardest not to simply point our what your character is looking at Ill analyze whats going on as the viewer. I often found you repeating Whats that... oh its blank. That can work sometimes but try to find other things to speak of rather than whats in focus at that time. Like I said it can be a hurdle to not point out what youre looking at God knows Im plenty guilty of it but once you can get past that I think youll find it easier to embody the character amp really make some funny and enveloping Lets Play episodes!!In regards to your endslate  Ive made the exact same mistake with FB amp Twitter annotations so I understand ya there in fact my current endslate still has the icons there with no links P.Your annotations start too early and your subscribe overlay actually fades back into view at the very end of the video. You have spotlights appear at   amp  whereas the endslate seems to fade in at approximately . Simple to adjust but notable nonetheless. Also I was a tad confused as to why all three of your annotations link back to your channel kind of defeats the purpose of a subscribe overlay in my opinion.I enjoy the games that you have been uploading recently amp I hope to see you grow quickly in the future! I believe you have potential and that your voice is well suited for this kind of work.Keep Growing!!HamSaad,youtubers,cm64krf,1,t5_2sj81

2402713,0,t1_cm8d0oz,Alrighty then thats weird that the gameplay was laggy I completely forgot to ever turn motion blur off so Ill get on that ASAP. As for the commentary I actually recorded this episode before I had posted the first one on the reddit so I knew that it hadnt improved at all. For the next couple that Ive done I did exactly what you said and just summarized the note quickly and moved along. As for the end slate I am super irritated! XD I dont know why this is such a difficult thing for me to design... Ill give another few whacks at it but you may have yourself a deal later on if I continue to be baffled by such a simple concept.

2575794,0,t3_2pad7g,Your stuff looks professional one thing I would recommend that I see the big Youtube channels doing is instead of uploading one clip thats  minutes long you should cut it up to make it around  minutes each. Someone is more willing to watch a  minute video then a  minute video and if you rock that  minutes theyll go on to watch the other   minute videos. Pretty much you increase your views and the amount of videos you have.,youtubers,cmusm50,2,t5_2sj81

So try to invest in those.Your videos dont have any commentary. Not even text to describe whats going on. Try to connect with the viewer by adding your own voice or at LEAST use text on the screen.Make your likes subscribes watched etc. private.

2674382,0,t1_cn7gyld,Thanks for the advice and yup I do this because I love it never expected to break big but I do love to entertain so a couple hundred views or some loyal subscribers is all I really ever wanted.  Id rather have a lower view count but people who love what I do then a quick viral hit but no lasting audience.Next episode Ill post here Ill be dubbing its certainly worth the work and its the suggestion everybody throws up so they must be on the right track.  Since I know what Im saying its hard for me to hear that its not as easy to understand.  Its the kind of step outside yourself thats hard when you toll away in isolation.ThisDo some Googling find some sites where your content will be welcome. Thats really your best bet.This is the holy grail for me these are the websites I havent found yet and Im really open to suggestions.Im with you on the low traffic boards but Im a newbie here so I cant even post anything anyway! but Im open to suggestions where silly snarky humor might find its best hold here and as specific as possible.  Obviously rvideo is not for me.  Again I completely understand the vast walls and valleys that stand before anybody theres certainly luck and right timeright topic but Im also always going to be a niche player with a somewhat niche video series so I thank everybody thats watched and commented.Any good place that post comedy videos Im all ears!And thanks for the article I think Ive got most of the bits down  consistent content its weekly on the same day quality at least to me but niche.

2676270,0,t3_2qknx1,Your url channel name and user name dont match. All three are slightly different thatll make it harder for people to spread via word of mouth. Okay so his channel is aaaa you gotta watch him they type in www.youtube.comaaaa but your URL is aaaabbbb and your username is aaaacccc thatll make you harder to find at best or get potential users lost entirely which you dont want for sure!Your banner and icon match! Very good. They even put out a good video games theme which is nice. I got no clue on this but the accumulation of dames as a commodity might put off female viewers. asked my lady friend about this she immediately had the same reservations about dames as a commodity and wonders how that relates to gaming as a wholeBut the BIG issue is that these graphics are just a tad on the bland side. Edit a good photo of you in behind the text grinning and happy just to set you apart from the other boring gaming channels out there. Some of the plain white text in the thumbnails are unreadable they really need a stroke or a text box to set them apart Id think. At least at their current tiny size. Rowdy DragonVERY cute video. Use Louis in your videos heck use him as your MASCOT. Hes so lovable! I will say your music drowned you out just a WEE bit in this one. Id turn the music down in the mix just a bit. Also a good endslate would probably help with branding and link to your other content which would certainly be good for you. All in all very cute.

I would suggest that you edit your audio. Get rid of the umsuhhs to make sure you get rid of as much dead air as possible.

2826587,0,t3_2sfouh,Alright first off  is an oddly high number for a countdown. When one thinks of a Top  Countdown its usually Top   sounds long. But what kept it interesting was the products. I thought it was great that they werent all oddly expensive but were actually unnecessary. There was a discrepancy in your voice between the item description and counting down the numbers and your last image slate? I think its called i dont know I dont even have one yet but the images are some kind of Raster file JPEGPNG and you can see the pixelation. You can solve that by saving them as Vector Images.Overall I liked it could maybe show the price onscreen with the image because some of them I was left wondering wait how much was that again?

3039558,0,t3_2uyfku,I enjoyed the video. As someone who knows next to nothing of Photoshop and had to use YouTube tutorials to learn how to make custom thumbnails I like that youre making videogame related images which could help people who want to make their own banners and things.The problem I have however is that I think your video sits uncomfortably in between a proper Photoshop tutorial and just a cool video showing off the creation of your image.As I said as someone who cant use Photoshop at all it can be very entertaining to watch how a professional looking promotional image can be put together the way you have. There is a kind of mystery and charm to watching other people effortlessly do things that are a mystery to you like watching guitar and drum covers of songs. If this is what youre going for then definitely speed it up as just like TheMeeeeoww said it is too long.However if you want to genuinely help people get to grips with Photoshop with proper tutorials then I would keep the speed as it is and ditch the music and have commentary over it instead where you explain what youre doing. Also I think by using a French? version of Photoshop you could be making it difficult for the vast majority of your viewers who dont speak French to follow what youre doing on the program. I appreciate that English isnt your first language but its something youll need to consider if going down the proper tutorial route. Also try and make sure all your spelling is checked before making or uploading a video you have spelt Assassins wrong in the actual video and that shows up on your thumbnail. I would also consider improving how you title your uploads. I dont know what a signature is in relation to the image you created and if I dont know what it refers to I wont be typing it in to the YouTube search bar. Also I assume Tuto means tutorial call it that. Make your titles as descriptive and precise as possible. Get an English speaker to help you with your translations if necessary. ,youtubers,cod1rgo,2,t5_2sj81
3047919,0,t3_2ut0e3,Since you linked to a single video not a channel this is review video not channel. Be careful for that!Your mic needs a pop filter to soften those s sounds and you should pull back from it a bit. You could emote more facially. You look a bit bored. I do agree that you might want a new host but I really think you could do it youve got the look for this kind of thing. Did you write these? Or collect them from somewhere? Theyre very cool stories. Really love the subject matter the intro and endslate are totally boss. Very very well done there. Honestly with a little work I think you could be a smash hit!,youtubers,codwzdp,2,t5_2sj81

3115014,0,t3_2vtoyi,I think a lot of your commentary the things you have to say at least is funny and intelligent. You just dont sound as excited as I wouldve liked. I enjoyed the videos though dont get me wrong. If you were more enthusiastic in your speech though Id be all over it. To gain more viewers you have to advertise yourself which sucks because no one likes that. Post on subreddits or rvideos where you can get a decent number of viewers for the games tweet at other Youtubers make friends and theyll promote you themselves in some cases. I havent really seen any websites where selfpromoting is encouraged but just posting your content on relevant subreddits is a big step forward.On a more technical note though your audio levels are strange. Not sure if its my . Surround Sound headset but all the audio is being played through my right ear. Its almost as if you have the mic on the right side of you set to stereo or youre only keeping the right channel of the mic for your videos.Keep making good stuff and people will keep watching but the only way they can find it is if you share it with them. The thing I tell everyone when it comes to anything creative be it videos music movies games software etc. You could have the greatest insert form of creative work here but if no one knows it exists it might as well be the worst. Not saying you need to selfpromote on others videos but you have to show people your content in some way. If you make NBA videos post on the rNBAk and some people will watch it some people might even subscribe!,youtubers,cokvctb,1,t5_2sj81

3207132,0,t3_2wkyn5,Your intro was a bit long the actualy video didnt start until the  second mark you always want the video to start by around  seconds in otherwise youll lose a lot of viewers. The video itself is a bit long too You could have made   minute videos or even   minute videos. People are willing to watch   minute videos more than they will a  minute video. Even more people would be willing to watch   minute videos. Always make your videos as short as possible with a point. Make an endplate showing other videos youve made and a Subscribe bar all annotated. Other than that you have a good voice man keep it up.,youtubers,couf27n,1,t5_2sj81

3370771,0,t3_2ysdo8,One thing that really bothers me is you have k subs and around  views per video. This could indicate several thing some of which I dont need to mention. One thing that it COULD be caused by is the excess amount of uploads. Youre uploading A LOT. While its good to upload a fair amount of content  videos per day is waaay over the top and if I was your viewer Id tire way too fast and fall behind and thus not watch quite a few of your videos. Im not trying to be discouraging but Im not sure what else I can put my finger on.Your channel header and so on looks spot on outro screen with a call to action etc. You might want to try engage more with questions towards the viewer near the end of the video. A different sort of call to action if you will.Best of luck!,youtubers,cpchqp5,2,t5_2sj81
3374113,0,t1_cpcv7or,Ah I see yeah the pacing is pretty good though I feel like it could still be a bit tighter.

3444429,0,t1_cpkisqa,Thanks for that feedback. It really means a lot to me.And yeah Im currently experimenting with my audio setup. Im using a Blue Yeti and just got myself Adobe Audition so Im taking some time to play around with those settings. The use of sound effects is also an idea I was thinking of and Ill definitely incorporate that into my next video which Im writing at the moment. And trust me I definitely wanted to use unique imagery for each story but couldnt find that much good Cinderella stuff where the quality was also good enough to use in the video. But I dont think this is going to be a problem for me future videos will mostly look at movies with more concrete source material. So for example if I look at Fight Club or Watchmen it will only one alternate story I look at.I truly and honesty appreciate the feedback and the time you and everyone else in this thread took to actually look and my video and comment on it.

3482035,0,t3_304wkd,Not bad! I have one suggestion though! You have a second camera which you cut to every now and then I would have someone holding that to get close ups and stuff ready to capture any particular action that unfolds with more interesting framings than youre getting from having it just sitting there at a low angle. It would add a lot more energy to the video instead of just cutting between two stationary cameras it will liven up the content immeasurably!

Just... so many triangles. And your camera was a little out of focus sometimes you probably have your camera set to an auto focus mode see if you can manually dial in the focus so that this doesnt happen in the future.Your audio was also pretty solid but it bothered me that the music audio cut out conspicuously at the end during the whole shitting on justin bieber part.

3778621,0,t3_33nx1a,Heres a few ideasHave other content that draws people in. So they have the opportunity to discover your vlogs when theyre looking around your channelbecome curious to know more about you.You could have a blog and let people know about your videos there. This could lead to doing guest blog posts on other blogs where you could let people know about your channel. You could add your channellatest video to your email signature if appropriate. Networking with other youtubers  collaborations shout outs featured channel section you could feature each others channel.Finding forums more topic specific subreddits blog discussioncomments where you could chime in if your vlog talks about something related. Be active in the YT community. Watch other peoples videos and comment. It doesnt matter what videos you comment on although ideally you should focus on videoschannels that your more likely to have a relevant channelvideo to link to. When people hover their mouse over your username in the comments they will see the first  roughly sentences from your channels about section. If possible post a link to your channel or any relevant video you have. It must be relevant or itll seem like spaminappropriate. Social media self promotion and reach out networking find people who you think might be interested in your content and see if you can join in on a conversation that could lead to your vlog being relevant to a topic.Do response type videos to more well known channels. Find out whats trending on social mediaYT and make a video that could incorporate the topic. Similarly you could make the most of tent pole events. Typically holidays movietv show releases etc. They could also be special events for you such as an announcement or reaching a milestone for your channel X amount of subs or views. Word of mouth. Get people you know personally to help share your stuff around. Ask what ever viewers you have to share your content around. Use click bait titles...but dont get too carried away or itll be pointless. Try not to be too misleading you want them to be able to forgive you for your deception.

3982137,0,t3_361z4v,its a good idea forgive me if im wrong but I think all smaller youtubers like the ones on this subreddit are unlikely to pay money for editing. And all big youtubers probably enjoy editing so wouldnt want someone else to do it.In my eyes the people you are looking for are businesss who have no experience or interest in editing but its gonna be hard to reach these people perhaps make a video titled something relevant like how to make a professional video explaining products which buisness owners are more likely too look up when starting a youtube channel for marketing purposes where you sell your services? Maybe just an idea thoEdit Upon looking at your site some pointers what are the effects that you mention you can edit in do you have any examples of stuff youve edited perhaps do a first video edited for free offer? cus theres no proof to your skills? Also at  a pop if your aiming at youtubers theyre gonna need to be big else theyl spend more on editing than they earn from ad revenuetrying to relay some constructive criticism its just my opinions,youtubers,cra75ua,1,t5_2sj81

4142086,0,t3_35veos,Your videos are good but Youtube is just insanely hard to get Subscribers at now. In retrospect I made videos from September of  to July of  and I gained approximately ish Subscribers making one video a week. I recently tried to get back into Youtube making as many as  videos a week and from August of  to February of  I gained around  Subscribers...Now I know a lot more plays into it but the fact remains Youtube is wayyyyyy too damn hard now a days. You need to be very luck to make a break through video and even then you wont have a crazy amount of Subscribers. Its a lot of hard work and sticking with it. Youre getting views on Tumblr which is good. If you want more Subscribers you could try announcing for people to sub at the start of the video or at the end of the video. Doesnt hurt to throw in an annotation saying to Subscribe as well. I feel that most people just forget to Subscribe and that by announcing it they are more than likely to Subscribe. Anyways your videos are good but its a long road to the top now a days so if you enjoy doing it keep on doing it if youre in it for Subscribers it wont be as fun.,youtubers,crseyh0,2,t5_2sj81

4209264,0,t3_383qto,Marketing.   Im pretty sure Ive said this to you before.People subscribe because they want to see more.  You need to know who that viewer is and what it is they want to see.  Im pretty sure that you hopefully didnt stand on a corner asking out every girl until your wife happened to walk by and say  yes.   Hopefully she caught your eye you learned about her and then you actively pursued her using what you learned about her to cull her affections.  Gaining subscribers isnt any different.   If you want an audience you have to woo them.  To woo them you have to first know what it is that woos them.

Fullscreen is good theres been some growth help split is better than every other network ive seen aside from polaris and curse however both are gaming exclusive but its a  year lock in contract.

That way everyone gets feedback.This also lets you learn from the wisdom and missteps of other youtubers. This is invaluable as are the connections you can make for crosspromotion and collaboration. Review the content of others reach out to those you like and youll make powerful allies! And if nothing else youll be a stronger content creator simply by learning from other creators! As it stands our mods are very busy so well only be giving reviews to those that follow this rule. ,youtubers,csgt562,1,t5_2sj81
4357987,0,t3_39v69d,Great video. You got the setup correct off the starting which is great. Your face is visible and you have a good mic. Those are so key and so many people mess that up. Since you have that all down what I would work on next is speech.You have a tendency to say uh and but a lot and I would focus to eliminate that completely. Your naturally defaulting to those words and your narration would be a million times smoother without it because it jams up your thoughts and gives you run on speech sentences. So just make it be conscious choice to notice each and every time you say them.You tend to talk in a way that leads you to justify what youre about to say or explain what your about to say and you dont need to do that. For example What Im about to do is ... go attack the enemy and gather more resources. You can eliminate that first phrase and just say Im attacking and getting resources. The reason Im pointing this out is because I feel like its not conducive to you. It makes the game play distant and future presence instead of front and center present in the moment. You talk about the game in a very objective way thats closer to an announcer than an actual player. I would practice getting myself into present tense orientated speech and being  fully immersed in the game play instead. I want you to go and download an app called elevate. Its an app that sort of aims to teach awareness of speech and writing which I think would be beneficial for you. I never thought I would suggest for improvement as a youtuber but I really feel that it applies for you. Its free and the app is a bunch of mini games. ,youtubers,csgvmmv,1,t5_2sj81
4358167,0,t3_3aszgd,You seem very comfortable in front of the camera and that is something I couldnt achieve for a very long time so I like that a lot. And that also makes the video way funnier than it can be. I laughed a lot watching this but the only advice i can give is to fix your camera angles. In most of the shots we can only see the half of your face and dont stand too far away from the camera. When youre talking to a camera while youre just sitting or standing if you put your face a little bit closer to the camera your facial impressions and gestures will look more clear and that will make it more funny. Other than that everything seems great so keep up the good work!,youtubers,csgwcue,2,t5_2sj81
4381162,0,t3_3arbt2,Jake! A couple of things have changed since you were last here.   Were tightening up our expectations of the Review tag.   Were asking posters to be a little more detailed as to what aspects of the video they would like to be reviewed.  Heres an example of an excellently written Review requestAlso we have a bot now to enforce Rule .  The unfortunate thing is the bot cant scan your old account and give you credit for all surplus reviews you may have done then so in a sense youre back at square one. Regarding your content  Ive followed you ever since you started posting here some months ago.   Technically speaking youve probably gone about as far as you can go given your resources time and budget.   I believe I said to you then as well as I am now  Its down to marketing at this point  that should be the takeaway from all the comments youve been receiving.You need to know who your target viewer is and what their viewing habits are.   Id honestly caution you not to go changing up your format too much without a solid idea of who your target viewer is.  If you take too much advice from those who arent going to be loyal subscribers and viewers anyway youre just going to end up with a mess that appeals to nobody and Id hate to see that happen.  Once youve identified your target viewer those are the individuals you poll about your content and design choices.  Those are the ones youre aiming to serve. Here are some questions I think would be essential for you to know to determine your target viewer   Are they more likely to be male or female?  Are they more likely to be over  or under?  Are they casual video watchers or avid?  Are they going to be professional or blue collar or stay at home?   Do they tend to watch any type of news frequently or infrequently?   Of the news programs they do watch how often do they share out a story they have seen with others?  How likely are they would they be to watch a link someone else has shared?  Do they tend to watch shared links more from Facebook email Twitter or some other means?Google Analytics arent going to tell you these things.  You have to make the effort of going out to people face to face asking them to watch and having them answer these kinds of questions.Hanging out here is alright and this is definitely one place where you can PM individuals who like your content poll them about their demographic and viewing habits to identify a target viewer.    Thats the best way to use this sub you really dont need technical and content review anymore youre beyond that.   Hanging out on marketing forums and subs is the best bet now... trying to learn the ways of successful marketing and target market identification.Best of luck bud!  By the way how is that new opportunity working out? ,youtubers,csjhqtk,1,t5_2sj81
4396002,0,t3_3b8xy1,I found your vlog to be pretty interesting as well. I liked your intro especially how you basically created your own theme song. I would suggest maybe doing something else in the background besides looking bored though. Also Id suggest editing the video down a bit.  minutes is pretty long and people will get bored after about  minutes. I found the sped up driving scenes to be fun but you could really shorten it down to maybe a minute by either increasing the video speed even more or cutting out parts. Overall I thought it was alright. Good luck with it!,youtubers,csl5xy7,1,t5_2sj81

4977537,0,t3_3j3akv,Right off the bat it might be a good idea to do some research. After talking about the watch that gives you the time in sentence format you sarcastically remark I love America. In fact the Qlocktwo is made by Biegert amp Funk a company based in Germany. A minor point in this video perhaps but doing the research will a give you more material to work with think where you could have gone with a sarcastic comment on German efficiency for example and b ensure you dont find yourself as I once did repeating as fact something that is actually fake.A serious issue I have with this video is that youre basically showing us still images taken from the net of the products while you talk in the background. Most of the time were just looking at an unchanging photo we really want to be seeing something more interesting. Since youre hardly going to buy the products and try them out for yourself just seeing you talking about them is enough. The images of them should be displayed briefly or in the background.If you are going to do a voiceover commentary stand back from the mic and talk clearly and confidently. This will help avoid the clipping I can hear at certain points. You need generally to watch volume levels the outro music was significantly louder than the rest of the video.There were some good moments for example when you talked about the ice cream scoop and said But I love stacking things so... Thats a nice amusing observation that only makes sense when you say it as much of that as you can manage please.,youtubers,culyf71,2,t5_2sj81

5166928,0,t3_3lqoag,I comment as I see.First of all the intro voice over is quite off sync. Maybe its just me.Second of all if youre protected by Fair Use theres no real reason to invert the footage of the anime on the opposite way and put in it a black and white filter because want it or not Fair Use does its job with unedited footage unless some company is very abusive with the ContentID system. Fair Use lets you use unedited footage for criticism purposes and you can see that in critics like Totalbiscuit Jim Sterling and everything.Third of all Id suggest you to get a script ready for the voice over I can notice some pauses here and there so be careful with that. Presentation is important.,youtubers,cv8t0jm,2,t5_2sj81
5252496,0,t3_3mxyjo,In all honesty it didnt keep my attention purely because it was just game audio and you speaking through text only. Some of the clips you featured had the potential to be much more entertaining if there would of been audio commentary from yourself which would show more emotion than text does.Yes the text was a bit fast which youve identified but next time id like to see a bolder text similar to the text you used at the start of the video and in key funny moments. I gather you may be on a tight budget which may be the reason for the lack of a mic but id definitely consider getting one.

Usually you would want a split screen video like this to be symmetrical but it makes sense for it to be asymmetrical in this case and it looks great!I feel like its unnecessary for the webcam shots to take up the whole screen in certain points due to the lower quality of the webcam shots. The game audio should be turned down a lower level than your voice recordings and both of you may want to speak up a bit.I also would recommend introducing yourselves before diving into the game play or at the very least plug your channel name.

We could have gone down to f. on one of the lenses when shooting Jai on the computer but then it would have been too shallow depth of field. But as we got that footage into post we realized it wasnt correctly focused and way to dark. We will have to look at setting up the lighting better for that shot in the future. Funny you say that We noticed Jais disgusting fingernails too in post lol. The thumbnail doesnt show the mouse clearly but we were happy to get Jais face and our new TShirts into the thumbnail. I think its got to be somewhere between our previous thumbnails for the naga epic kraken and the g for the correct composition of our thumbnails.As I said before with every video we have gotten better.

6297852,0,t1_cz5hhr7,Specifically your voice overmodulates from time to time  solution is a mix of voice control level monitoring and perhaps a better microphone. Ideal solution would be to record into Audition or Audacity or something so you can watch your levels. I tend to overmodulate a LOT because I have terrible voice control so I actually have a Tascam device that records two tracks for each channel  a primary track and a safety track thats db lower. Saves my bacon all the time! But it also cost  so ... might be overkill.Another thing to think about moving forward would be the cohosts youre chatting with. You seemed way more professional and had a better presenter persona than the dude you were chatting with so maybe have a game plan with him and make sure youre on the same page in terms of the tone youre going for before you start recording?

6326986,0,t3_42a5b3,gtI guess a good question is how I can make it clear that the mistakes are intentional without having to be so heavyhanded in my explanation. I think something as simple as a text card in the beginning can give a brief overview that the bad review is on purpose. Something like This video is for comedic purposes and should not be taken seriously is really all that needs to be said.gtWas there anything that just sat totally wrong with you guys? Honestly HONESTLY I felt the video needed a transition phase from being yourself and changing into the act of doing a bad review. I really didnt know where it started or began and it really lost me. gtFor my content itself its intentionally rambly and useless but is there an obvious entertainment opportunity that Im missing out on?Im not sold on the idea from my view point. The video is too good in some areas so the whole joke just doesnt work. I understand trying to keep it watchable but its so middle of the road that it really stops itself from getting any kind of reaction out of me. I think you need to either have a good quality video with bad critiques not off topic things like what you did in this one but rather just totally stupid remarks of stuff that was completely fine in the movie itself or just do a video trying to be intentionally bad at pretty much every level.gtIm worried that only content creators are going to appreciate the bad aspects of this.Ties in perfectly to what Im feeling so far. Dont let this discourage you though as humor is incredibly subjective and this video probably wasnt for me. Still I hope some of this is useful to hear.,youtubers,cz8t5au,1,t5_2sj81
6334326,0,t3_428g6c,Hi! There are two things that stood out to me.Firstly the robotman voice the pacing is a little odd and I found I was focusing more on that than what he was saying. Its probably just a personal preference but I find robotic voices to fall into the uncanny valley. Im pretty sure you could coerce a sternsounding male you know and the same lines would come off punchier.The other was that it ended very abruptly! I dont quite know how to put it but it was like when you get up to walk across the room and turn off your lights but the power cuts out half way across the room and you trip and bang your knee. Sorry Im not very good at technical jargon. But maybe an extra second or so after youve finished talking? A wave or something maybe.,youtubers,cz9n65t,2,t5_2sj81

6778613,0,t1_d0kbu7a,Matroska mkv is just a container format meaning its impact on file size is negligible and it supports vastly more video and audio encodingcompression formats than .mp.  Also MP is patentencumbered and generally inferior to Matroska.  Thats why Google chose a subset of Matroska when they came up with their WebM standard its just Matroska minus some features any tool that can read Matroska can read WebM for example.Then theres the fact that by using Matroska I can actually save a lot in regards to file size since it allows me to use VP for video and Opus for audio.  I actually do my recordings in h. though because the CPU overhead is much less due to hardwareaccelerated drivers for that particular video format but I always use Opus for the best quality audio for the file size.Ive actually written a Matroska encoder well its not really an encoder as much as it is an encapsulator from scratch before in Python to encapsulate MJPEG and Opus audio streams in the past.  Cant do that with mp haha.Theres some debate as to whats best  HVAC or VP.  However theres no debate about Opus.  Its essentially the be all end all audio encoding format that will likely take over everything soon as the webm standard gets traction hardware encoding and decoding support for VP and VP has made its way into many SoC packages already!.Its funny that you bring that up because video and audio encoding formats are something I care deeply about and have significant practial experience haha!Aside  Now that Khronos Group has released Vulkan the lack of hardwareaccelerated VP and VP encodingdecoding should soon become a thing of the past!,youtubers,d0kn183,1,t5_2sj81

6965934,0,t3_4b49sc,Honestly I think part of the reason your audience retention is  is bc your accent can be difficult to understand sometimes. I think your idea is funny and your energy is really good but I find myself having to listen really closely or back up the video to catch what youre saying sometimes and eventually I just wanted to stop watching bc I was doing so much work lol. You cant really do anything about your accent and honestly those of us with boring old American accents enjoy listening to other people accents so I would maybe work on how you can speak more clearly? Also maybe work on a new background. The plain white wall behind you is very boring. Good luck!,youtubers,d15xab8,1,t5_2sj81

A lot of guys take on a character a font etc. so that when people see their videos they know who it is and it stands out from the crowd robbaz is a really good person to look at for thumbnails also look at the like of PBG and Jon tron etc. Banner  Your banner is ok but its not really appealing even making your text bigger and adding a character etc. would really make it a lot more pro and appealing. Trailer  Your trailer needs a little work a continues clip is slightly lazy you only have to make a trailer once so why not spend some time splice some games together etc. your taking and stuff is fine but nothing really made me WANT to subscribe.Intro  Its ok some videos i seen have just text as well but you can find a nice template really quickly online which has a bit more ompf Logo  Cant really read the text on it and it makes me think on minecraft! keep it simple maybe just a huge X? instead of the whole word Videos  the quality is good! You should really add an end credit thing like for e.g. honest trailers which has a link to another video and tells people to subscribe.Apart from that keep up the good work!

I see what you were going for and in terms of keeping attention its as far as I can say without a direct comparison the direction youre going in. The problem is you went too far. Many of the cuts in your video were distracting especially when you completely cut up one sentence at around  or so. I get that it was supposed to be for comedic effect but it didnt work for me and instead made it hard to understand some of the words.As for your question about the ending I agree that there was something missing with the ending but I cant put my finger on it.

8022344,0,t3_4oxeei,Pros I liked your humor. Even though sometimes I felt like some of the jokes were a bit over the top overall  it was good. You obviously spent some time planning the video and composing a script which is great. It worked out pretty well for you. I liked the intro joke  it was not expected it was quite funny and it kinda set the mood for the rest of the video.Cons Even though I liked your joke in the intro I felt like the intro itself the one with your logo that you probably did in Adobe After Effects could be either more interesting or a bit shorter  seconds tops  but thats just my opinion and Im not a big fan of intros on Youtube. At the beginning there was no content other than you talking the picture of Kratos and the text that followed what you were saying. I think it would be a good idea to use the previous games trailers at the beginning instead of this. Sometimes I felt like there was too much going on on the screen and it was too fast. But thats your own style I can understand that and actually appreciate it but thats just probably not what Im personally looking for on Youtube.All in all I think it was quite good you should keep it up.,youtubers,d4hsbyb,1,t5_2sj81

This is exactly what people who search your keywords are looking for especially from an unkown name. Still I think you could repeat yourself less and leave out a few vague phrases Id recommend it to pretty much anybody adds nothing to any discussion.I definitely dont think its too short. The structure is good I like the cutaway but please dont describe what happens in the fun fact segment! The description is almost longer than the fact. Who isnt able to infer whats going to happen in a section called fun fact? The section is a nice idea.The editing was pretty good but its hard to get a proper sense of whats going on in such short clips.

Punchline had to do with the staff getting lostthrown into a portal while the wizard was flying only to have it thrown back at the wizard after the water crash scene at the end. We cut all that out because of complications You didnt notice how flat the wizard was flipping in the air from one portal to another on one angle but Im wondering if thats just me.As for the I car...I was lazy. I didnt want to bother with masking it out. xDSide note We have footage for a behind the scenes we could do up. Think thered be an interest for it?

8656392,0,t1_d6nmkf1,I found one off Newegg. I personally have TB but honestly the bigger you can get without breaking the wallet is always preferred in this case.Video size depends on a lot of stuff. Video size is dependent on a few things. But they all relate to how much is going on onscreen. Videos that are more static as in each pixel doesnt change very often like a static background will use less room because it can simply tell it to stay the same. Higher resolution also bumps up size A LOT. FPS will increase on a linear scale.Basically make your videos and figure out how big they are. Bigger is always better when you archive them but knowing how big to expect them to be will tell you how many you can archive before you need another harddrive or to start deleting them. Oh and I always recommend archiving.Which brings me to your next question. I always render into a straight mp file. Largely because I want to archive and archiving within iMovie would be ridiculous but also because you want a backup copy in the immediate future in case something weird happens. Would never trust the straight to youtube function.As for what youre problem might be... Always make sure you do regular cleaning of an iMovies file system. That might be its biggest weakness as an editor.,youtubers,d6nnx4h,2,t5_2sj81

8822736,0,t3_50zlxy,Good video and great message. I definitely see this a lot and have had my constructive criticism dismissed in the past as well so it was refreshing to hear your take on the subject. The editing and execution is pretty solid. Your points were wellarticulated and you have a good sense of pacing.As for my criticism I dont think you did anything wrong per se though I do feel like there are aspects that couldve been done better. This is more of a personal preference sort of thing but the video seems to be lacking a distinct personality like it needs some spicing up or punchup. Dont get me wrong you definitely come across as likeable and all but there isnt much to distinguish you from other YouTubers. Everything was wellpresented and wellarticulated but the actual commentary just leans a bit too much towards the generic side. All in all while I didnt feel like there was much at fault at all I do feel like it lacked a more distinctive tone.Good luck on your future videos!,youtubers,d78ddq3,1,t5_2sj81

Your information delivery Its clear and easy to understand The mood of your voice Im not sure if its the right word but you sounded upbeat and enthusiastic in your video and that made your video better.The could be better General video outline As I was watching this video I knew that you were talking about body language due to your intro but the main focus of the video FEET did not come up until the middle of the video. More mention of it in the beginning will help Your avatar I dont mean to be rude or mean but your avatar felt very out of place in the video especially considering the artwork of the other illustrations. Adding it in the end is a bit ok but I actually said what? when I saw your avatar in the intro. Voice fluctuation? Basically the ups and downs of your voice are a bit too erratic.

9817601,0,t3_5fqg98,gtI am not sure why the video comes out very yellowish It happened because the video has not been properly white balanced as it should be.   The camera should have white balancing settings usually an automatic mode where it tries to correctly white balance itself then typically a mode for outdoor sunlight indoor tungsten light indooor halogenCFL lighting outdoor cloudy and outdoor shade.   Even if you set these correctly a video can still be incorrectly white balanced so you would have to do it manually in your NLE. White balancing means what it implies Making sure the whites on screen actually look white.   White is the easiest color to balance because all levels of Red Green and Blue in the pixel should be close to the same value.  A pure white has a pixel value of   for the Red Green Blue channels respectively.   But you shouldnt ever really have a pure white because objects in real life arent ever pure white.  But the values ought to be close in value.   If you take your eyedropper tool in your NLE and grab the values of a pixel in an area that should look white the values may be something like  .   No they arent exactly all the same but its close enough.  If the values were  then that tells you there is too much Blue in the video and so everything is going to looking sort of blueish. Your NLE should have instructions on how to manually white balance to video there is more than one way of doing it.gtpreferred photoshop or program to make nice thumbnails...Programs dont make nice thumbnails.

9827322,0,t3_5fycpm,Now Im not seeing this as a FilthyFrank type video. I see this as the Nigahiga trees iDubbz branch Nigahiga is the influence for the jumpcuts and iDubbz is a cynic whos comedy does make use of pop culture jokes sadly I believe the video to be shallow. Maybe a bit silly to here about a YouTube video but it is true that your depth isnt quite there the lacking of a fresh voice may not be entirely neededwould be a great help still. And the techniques youve learned are mishandled. Ive watched your two Anti Viral videos off the bat you dont have enough to talk about. The reason for iDubbz cynical review videos being long is not to make that YouTube money it is because thats just the time it take to turn an argumentative essay into a video. Yes a critique of any time is some form of an argumentative essay. To jog your memory an argumentative essay needs a beginning middle end thesis supporting detailsparagraphs conclusion. Now for a YouTube video youll probably shorten the introduction paragraph to a little joke and a few linesIve seen iDubbz only say the claim for the intro but you cannot forget about supporting details as your jokes will have to follow and align with them.   When I look at your first Anti Viral video its just one point stretched to an entire videonot being sincere you also dont explain your critique for quite a bit. Then your second video brings up two points. People can tell when your stretching a point a video where you are attacking viral challengesvideos in general should be enough. Also as an argumentative essay should be state your point then throw in evidence. You try to do a joke as supporting detail before you state your point of the supporting paragraph.Lets look at your editing on the video linked. Creating a voice is pretty hard so it is understandable how your videos will closely resemble winning tonesstyles of videos but your video here is not quite striking. You dont use the famous Nigahiga jumpcut correctly you dont cut to make an incomplete thought. If you want to throw in a variation of the plethoraofjumpcut style then I would push you to use jumpcut as a cute transition between details or even jokes.  Your jokes are weak too. They do have potential. You try to pull on the absurdity string in comedy but just doing random thing with a random things will get old. Even the crude and absurd Frank and iDubbz  have jokes that crude absurd jokes but the comedy comes from the jokes flow with the points or story and following other rules of comedy. Throwing an absurd joke sparingly is fine if you need to scratch that itch. In this video in particular I think the destroying of your swan could of been immensely more funny with a ramping anger throughout the review which in the beginning you could be petting the swan or showing some type of affection then you just destroy the swan and continue the review calmly or angrier if you wanna go that route. Also note the more original the joke the better.  Commenting about vertical video any common cliche joke or thought  without adding a funny or different way to say it is dull.  Was the drink in the beginning supposed to be a setup to the egg? If the bottle was supposed to tip me off then I would ask to be a bit more obvious subtly is the key to good writing. I do applaud you for nice graphics I applaud you for looking so comfortable in front of the camera. I felt like you were talking to me naturally and your physical timing was good. A stone that needs some heavy polishing but worth the trouble.  I also hope you enjoy the irony of this comment on formatting your video. ,youtubers,daois2a,2,t5_2sj81

9881674,0,t3_5gwhxo,gtAlso Id pretty much be doing this because I am desperate for money.Prepare to get disappointed. People with this kind of mindset tend to fail with their channels. YouTube is not just a quick money platform. You CAN make money off this but you need to be  dedicated and upload consistent videos. If you cant do any of that then your idea is already a fail.My advice Try it out for a few days. If you dont find it fun or you cant keep up with the uploading then you should give up because you wont earn any money.,youtubers,davltcg,8,t5_2sj81

9986975,0,t1_db8trtl,Oh okay. I thought you meant you wete going to buy one but it seems you already have one. Id use this free program called OBS Open Broadcast Software this program lets you layer the gameplay and facecam at once in realtime and record it. You can stream with it as well also you can do both at thr same time!The mic I use is cheap but sounds very nice. It is the Floreon BM and is on sale for  off or USD. You can find audio tests of it on YouTube it is quite a steal. You may want to buy a Mic Boom as well this is the one I have. It gets the job done for cheap.For editing I use Sony Vegas Pro . This program is quite powerful but may take sume time to learn although it is quite intuitive. Now it is quite expensive but I got mine through ways...If youd like some channel art I can do that for free. Here is some of my past work.Additionally if youd like I can edit a video or two for you. I know that itd be like send a video of my son to some stranger on the internet? so I dont really mind what happens either way I just feel like helping out is all. You can find my part work here,youtubers,db9bx51,1,t5_2sj81

10286725,0,t3_5n9ub0,I think it looks very amateurish the very first few seconds even I know it doesnt necessarily need to be all animated or something but leaving large portions of white background is a huge thing that makes me wanna turn it off almost immediately. The pointless part with the chacaron macaron even though short why was it really there? As well as the fart noise later on it seems really infantile maybe its just not my style but I didnt really like it personallyThe fonts used later on were super basic Im not saying you need to use something with huge outlines flashy effects neons shadows and everything but something a bit more fancy and also more personal and unique to your style than arialTNRImpact,youtubers,dca21vl,2,t5_2sj81

10432026,0,t3_5p9uty,I dont know if it was just me but your audio seems wildly out of sync at the end of your video. Do you use Handbrake or anything to align it? I think youre right about your strengths and weaknesses. Your editing is really tight in some spots and I agree your color could use some more pop to it. That could be a lot to do with your current camera. GoPro works really well in bright light but any shadedarkness and it can wash out. Given that this is a really long video Id give this critique Make sure that what youre including especially in a vlog is critical to the story youre telling. You had I think four different shots of yourself walking to your truck to get in it and there wasnt any reason for that except for style. Considering you have one camera that means you have to set up a shot walk away do your action walk back set up the next shot walk away do your action etc. Because nothing happened except you got in your truck it looked more like security footage of someone being stalked than anything so make sure if youre going to have more than one angle on some action its an action worth capturing from more than one angle.I call this Casey Neistat Disease because everyone suddenly wants to walk past the camera in  different takes nowadays because he did it LOL.Also the angle when you talk to the camera could be lifted. I felt like your drop ceiling was another character in your vlog.Overall your editing is really good and you know how to make visuals compelling so tightening up on making the vlogs about something would be something Id really encourage. Keep at it! ,youtubers,dcqjfnl,1,t5_2sj81

The composition of you two sitting there was also a bit off  I would encourage you to keep working on how your videos look. When you two were showing the outfits I noticed that the wall behind you was very standard family house wall. Thats not a bad thing if its what youre going for but for me I prefer more aesthetically pleasing backgrounds that are a bit more stylish especially for a clothing type video. Hope that helps in some way!,youtubers,dcs9q9f,2,t5_2sj81

10966274,0,t3_5w186j,Id start by completing the work you began. The worst thing for momentum is perfectionism. This content may not be exactly what you had in mind and it probably will require improvement but something finished will always have more value than something you dont finish even if what youve done isnt optimal.Everybody starts from square one and improvement comes with practice. Perfectionism is another way of procrastinating for so many creative people including myself. If you are constantly tweaking material until its perfect you never have to finish and you never really have to compare what youve done to the vision you had in your head. Youre going to improve as you make more and more content and then you can look back and see how far youve come. Its a conundrum every creative person has faced as theyve started making things. Relax and dont be so hard on yourself! Its probably much much better to others than what youre seeing with your own critical eyes and ears. ,youtubers,deb3e12,1,t5_2sj81

11148997,0,t3_5z59j3,An interesting concept for a series! Some channel critique to start withI would add a banner to the channel and a brief description of what your channel is about. Right now it looks like the channel isnt ready yet so Id start with that. I love the name of the series though Ill say if you didnt mention here what it was about I wouldnt get any indication from the channel itself or your playlist. So Id add a description of that series to both your about section of your channel and to the playlist as well. That will give you some extra help from search which will allow you to get people who like to find interesting weird or crazy things that happened in real life. Your video is well done for the most part. Mostly Id say talk a bit louder or get a better microphone mostly just talk louder I think or bump up the audio in your editing program because you can be a little difficult to hear. But your style is really easy to watch and you cover your subject really well.Overall I think this has the potential to be a very popular series. I think it just needs a few small tweaks to make it easier to find and looking topnotch. Great job!! ,youtubers,devq69d,2,t5_2sj81

11362166,0,t3_61xmnj,A little sketch comedy. Indeed youre just starting out but more power to you. Just keep honing your craft build narratives and find out what works.I view the sketch as essentially absurdity and thats fine with me. I like absurd humor.For sound it would be good to edit our some of the soft white noise in the background. As for the camera try to keep your movements in frame unless you have a good reason not to be in frame. Obviously having a third person there to do the camera work would be great because it would allow you to have both of you in shot. But even without a third person consider using a tripod or a stack of books or something so when the dad enters the room or when youre introducing the kid you at least get one shot of them both in the room. This will be in the viewers minds... they have SEEN both people in the same room and they will remember that even as you are cutting back and forth between the two. Think of it as an establishing shot of sorts.Keep up the good work and I hope you see fit to check out my own YouTube Channel The Joy of DrinkingThanks for posting!

TIL video camera sliders exist and theyre interesting pieces of equipment.That aside I think the background music was a good choice and it blended really well with the outdoor clips.Also the quality of the outdoor shots was delightful. Vivid colors a bit of lens flare here and there not to mention the slider effect itself I think you really nailed it.I like the fact that you presented the possible downside of using a heavier camera when the slider is mounted on only one tripod. If I ever get into shooting Ill keep that in mind.And dont worry about your English skills. Im not a native English speaker myself but I was able to understand everything you said.

11803001,0,t3_67f5g1,Its disappointing to see that intro and blasting dubstep are so heavily associated. They shouldnt be you dont need to scream at viewers to get them to stay. In fact if thats the case youre doing it wrong in my mind.Ive been using intro clips from the start. shortening them as I went Thiss the whole nine yards skillfully edited footage from the subject matter music Id purchased and have been licensed and clear title text in  seconds or less. At this point its a design choice each one catered for each series. It takes more time than a cold open but theres a reason I spend a day or more on a single intro. First because it looks good second because it definitely gets attention.,youtubers,dgxwt9e,1,t5_2sj81
