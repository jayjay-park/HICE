6827677,0,t3_499swr,bond units are essentially children attributed to your corrin and the persons corrin that you bond with. it takes around  days of both sides giving each other accessories to create one. they are blue shield units and are also identified by a mark on the face. the main reason to get a bond unit is because their unique bonus skill can be almost anything including useful skills such as astra or renewal.,MyCastleFE,d0q7tnu,1,t5_3cuxx

9824990,0,t1_danai4t,Wary fighter is really good on slow units. Like for example Xander doesnt have much speed and he can rarely make a follow up attack. Putting wary fighter on him allows him to survive longer since he and the enemy wont be able to follow up attack. Thats why wary fighter is thought by generals because of their low speed.,MyCastleFE,dao7tfs,3,t5_3cuxx
