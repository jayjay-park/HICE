2138307,0,t1_clbluv8,With this strategy were starting the war down six attacks.  The underlying idea I believe is that our lower guys struggle attacking up.  If we attack three down then the bottom three players are not going to have much chance at a successful attack.    I guess I disagree with the underlying idea.  I believe the game ranks us on defense but we all have varying offensive capabilities and troop strength.  Therefore I dont think that just attacking down three targets would be necessarily easier to three star because it is still not accounting for our troop levels.,RedditExordium,clbmjmk,1,t5_33ul5
