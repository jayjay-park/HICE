4423743,0,t3_3bpc2i,Not too sure about this but I believe that the game engine wasnt completely made from scratch. Somewhere I think I saw that it was made using an RPG maker of some sort modified of course to suit the game.  Point being that if Nintendo were to try and release this and make money of of it there would be legal issues with those who created the RPG engine.  Again I could be wrong here.    I personally think Nintendo stepping in with big time professional devs to help finish the game is a fantastic idea provided they somehow preview the content of the game first. Make sure its Motherseries worthy which Im sure it totally is.,mother4,csob1co,1,t5_2vtke

8951455,0,t3_52tvaa,I personally have a hopeful suspicion that theres a lack of updates because they want to surprise us with something. As theyre working on the surprise they post announcements for updates. These updates dont happen though. Because of this lots of people will check almost daily to see if theres anything new only to be hit in the face by the surprise. Maybe its something really interesting thats too big for a regular update maybe its the very sudden and unexpected release of the game which is the reason they havent posted any updates. Theyre just working so hard on it that they dont have any time to respond to fans or even see any of the complaints.Basically Im just hoping that theyre really close to finishing the game hence the lack of updates. It is really really REALLY unlikely though.Most likely just some problems with personal life motivation or development itself.Lets just wait.,mother4,d7nty4l,2,t5_2vtke

10993394,0,t3_5wzfjk,. Since the Mother series name has been inspired from a John Lennon song would you call the game from another song from LennonBeatles? I think Across The Universe could be perfect.. Why no Kickstarter? I want to give you money damn it!Thanks for your efforts guys! The game looks incredibly good.,mother4,dee2eor,46,t5_2vtke
10997038,0,t3_5wzfjk,Im just really glad about the name change.Id love to play another Mother game as much as anyone else in this subreddit. But knowing what I know about the dev team Im even more excited to see your own unique vision for a game.,mother4,deehb4v,1,t5_2vtke

11006127,0,t3_5wzfjk,I for one suggest Mother Earth as a good replacement name.  Thats Bound to catch some interest.I fully agree with this decision.  As far as Im concerned its still a Mother game for that matter so is Undertale.  Itoi may have said the fans will make the sequel but he also said Animal Crossing makes a good sequel so clearly the spirit of the thing is what matters not the name.Also I would never consider you sellouts for deciding to sell your game now that its free of IP conflict baggage.  This games got my attention enough that Id be willing to buy it at this point.  I know youre not going to do that this time and I thank you for it but know that if down the line you decide to make this a profitable business for yourselves youve got my support.,mother4,defihxt,1,t5_2vtke

11168008,0,t3_5zc2ny,Well since theres the whole radio theme itd be cool if there was some sort of Fallout  Three Dog type radio host character. Maybe a character you can optionally meet later on who offers tips and secrets if you interact withlisten to radios around the game world.EDIT Also maybe you can call into the radio station and answer tough trivia in exchange for items?,mother4,dexvrfd,4,t5_2vtke
11175123,0,t3_5zc2ny,I hope for some selfreferential humor. Making fun of how long the game took to develop references to its renaming and the community etc.,mother4,deyormp,6,t5_2vtke
11194401,0,t1_df0q5ic,I thought that was kind of what it looked like although my thoughts were more along the lines of something using the Construct  wave effect.,mother4,df0veh3,1,t5_2vtke

11451175,0,t1_dftxz6y,Its funny you mention this because tbh we dont know how much of that stuff in the trailer is actually completed in the game and how much of it is just video editing. ,mother4,dftzcfm,4,t5_2vtke

11567690,0,t3_64z6ni,I wouldnt have put it quite so bluntly but I really didnt care about the rebrand announcement either.Actually your opinion is probably the most popular.  Negative feelings get discussed more often but Id be surprised if more than  of fans are seriously upsetdisappointed.,mother4,dg77bmf,6,t5_2vtke
11583528,0,t3_65b2jo,Im glad that the wave of people irrationally or unnecessarily complaining has dropped out of participating in the subreddit. Im curious to see their next big announcement whatever it is.,mother4,dg9005o,14,t5_2vtke
