Like drama camp  hours  days in a row not til august! Not cool.Im feeling super frazzled. We have this great schedule but around  its like she realizes she actually didnt have a ton of fun all day and goes from not listening at all to being super sweet to make up for it but only after the time outsdiscussion over what she did wrong etc etc. so its basically a shitty hour then great hour then shitty half hour then good half hour then shes asleep.

1218989,0,t3_2827hk,Oh I know this one all too well. In my case though its the husband and hunting. I used to end up with the kids  and dont get me wrong I still do a lot but I had to stand up for myself. He always told me to leave and go do something with my friends but never really meant it. If I did leave he would call a half hour later saying he was taking the kids to his moms because he couldnt handle them. Drove me crazy! Make plans and stick to them. Tell him how unfair he has been and give him examples.  days is a long time and since you havent got a break it will only make you more and more angry to the point you will resent him. If need be start small. Take a bath with the door locked for an hour go shopping turn off your phone but no matter what happens do not let him off the hook for taking care of his children. ,BreakingParents,ci6r6bx,1,t5_312wz

1381904,0,t3_291g4n,It took about a year for us to get a routine set with our parenting with our twins. My husband already commented umajorlugo but Ill comment from the other side.Ive gotten to the point where I realize that as a SAHP the housework falls on me. But if I look at it as a job its more tolerable. We had to have a lot of talks about the fact that neither one of us have it easier than the other and that we need to approach parenting as a team. Weve both come to realize that we are better parents when we get alone time so Im content to watch the girls for a few hours if he does the same. It took a lot for me to see that his job is very stressful and it took a lot for him to see that its not all fun and games with the kids. Once we stopped trying to compete for who has the harder role and started working together things got SO much better.When it comes to chores find what each of you enjoy doing and take over that chore. I love mowing the grass. It gets me out in the sun and I can listen to music while doing something mindnumbing and my husband doesnt really care for it so hes totally happy to watch the girls while I mow. He loves to cook and it relaxes him so he takes care of making dinner almost every night. Hes also a better cook than I am I can follow a recipe but hes good at improvising and making it taste yummy. If he doesnt want to cook he knows Im willing to. My husband likes video games and one compromise that weve settled on was him playing on his laptop in the living room while he keeps an eye on the kids while I do other stuff. He gets to have fun the kids are independent players and I can listen to music while I do some chores. It might be worth getting a used game console that he can play on the TV with the kids playing independently. With twins the give and take between the parents is a lot more difficult. With being a SAHP youre always outnumbered when the spouse isnt home so its very easy to feel overwhelmed. Finding the balance is hard. For the first year of my twins life my marriage wasnt great. But we survived and my twins are  now. If I can get through the next year without a serious alcohol problem I think well be okay thats sort of a joke...Really its going to take a lot of talking to resolve this. I would HIGHLY recommend writing out what you want to say so that emotions dont get the better of you in the heat of the moment. If you have to make a family schedule of who gets alone time and when do it! ,BreakingParents,cipi7ql,1,t5_312wz
