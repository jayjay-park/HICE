Your experience may vary wildly from those of us who were MSIII trainers last year. Hell CLC was TOTALLY different from the year before us and they are changing it AGAIN this year. You are going to have your own unique experience and itll be up to you to adapt and complete the training. Also the fact that they changed the title of the position from MSIII trainer  to PL  might be an indicator that some big changes have been made. Key point here is that Cadet Command changes their damn mind all the time and you never know what its going to be like till you get there. You can only hear stories. ,ROTC,d13wk1m,1,t5_2s7z5

Also generally ranks change based off position sometimes you could go up and down in rank several times a year just based off what positions youre rotated into. Overall as cadets its important to not take rank seriously because were students before soldiers and were at the bottom of the army totem pole. Finally in the rest of the militarys eyes were just dumb cadets and theyll probably laugh at you if you introduce yourself as cadet captain so and so.
