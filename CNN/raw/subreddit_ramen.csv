2196973,0,t3_2k96vu,This is essentially the Momofoku recipe straight from out of the book.Two X inch pieces of konbu dried kelp find this at Asian markets quarts of water use at least an quart stock pot cups dried shiitakes rinsed well clean them good or youll end up with a scummy broth pounds freerange chicken either a whole bird or legs pounds pork neck bones pound smoky bacon bunch scallions medium onion cut in half large carrots peeled and roughly choppedTar this is basically the main seasoning  the primary salt component  in ramen. This recipe takes another hour to make and I didnt have enough pots or the time to make it this time around but I will in the future  or  equal parts kosher salt soy sauce and mirin to taste more about this in the directions belowRinse the konbu under running water then combine it with the water in an quart stockpot. Bring the water to a simmer over high heat and turn off the heat. Let steep for  minutes.Remove the konbu from the pot and add the shiitakes. Turn the heat back up to high and bring the water to a boil then turn the heat down so the liquid simmers gently. Simmer for  minutes until the mushrooms are plumped and rehydrated and have lent the broth their color and aroma.Heat the oven to F.Remove the mushrooms from the pot with a spider or slotted spoon. Add the chicken to the pot. Keep the liquid at a gentle simmer with bubbles lazily and occasionally breaking the surface. Skim and discard any froth foam or fat that rises to the surface of the broth while the chicken is simmering and replenish the water as necessary to keep the chicken covered. After about  hour test the chicken the meat should pull away from the bones easily. If it doesnt simmer until thats the case and then remove the chicken from the pot with a spider or slotted spoon. After I let the chicken cool off I shredded all the meat to save for future use and tossed the bones in the freezer to make a future chicken stockWhile the chicken is simmering put the pork bones on a baking sheet or in a roasting pan and slide them into the oven to brown for an hour turn them over after about  minutes to ensure even browning.Remove the chicken from the pot and add the roasted bones to the broth along with the bacon. Adjust the heat as necessary to keep the broth at a steady simmer skim the scum and replenish the water as needed. After  minutes fish out the bacon and discard it. Then gently simmer the pork bones for  to  hoursas much time as your schedule allows. Stop adding water to replenish the pot after hour  or so.Add the scallions onion and carrots to the pot and simmer for the final  minutes.Remove and discard the spent bones and vegetables. Pass the broth through a strainer lined with cheesecloth. You can use the broth at this point or if youre making it in advance and want to save on storage space you can do what Momofuku does return it to the pot and reduce it by half over high heat then portion out the concentrated broth into containers. It keeps for a couple of days in the refrigerator and up to a few months in the freezer. When you want to use it dilute it with an equal measure of water and reheat it on the stove.In either case finish the broth by seasoning it to taste with tar  or   or  tablespoons of combined kosher salt soy sauce and mirin per quart. Taste it and add more seasoning to get it right. It should be very seasoned almost too salty. Underseasoned broth is a crime. I made a seasoning mix of salt soy sauce and mirin to season the entire  quarts I ended up with but you may have to add additional seasoning after the broth sits overnight.It was getting super late and I forgot to take pictures of the chashu and egg process. But the liquid from the chashu was reserved to make the eggs. ,ramen,clj38gm,3,t5_2qykd

4978391,0,t1_cum0slx,The eggs marinate in the same stuff that the chashu was cooked in for at least an hour preferably  so they have to be done ahead of time anyway. If theyre cooked correctly and peeled carefully theyll keep in the fridge for a few days. Yes theyre better fresh but you really dont loose much if theyre done the day before.  I asked my buddy who is a pro chef for his cooking strategygt Start eggs in hot water simmering not boiling time for  minutes then place in ice bath. Allow to cool before peeling. I find that starting from the pointy end yields an easier removal of the shell in its entirety. Also peel under running water over a strainer to catch shells or submerged. PS the fresher the eggs the harder to peel. Ideally speaking hard boil eggs after they been in the fridge for a week or so.For these softboiled eggs take the time down to about  minutes. Youll have to experiment a bit to get them to the doneness you want.Heres my Chashu recipe  cup soy  cup chicken broth   cup mirin  cup sake  a large hand of ginger  half bulb of garlic   an onion   scallion whites   table spoon fresh cracked black pepper. I actually crush whole peppercorns in a mortar and pestleCombine liquids in a small pot and simmer until the alcohol from the sake has cooked off about  minutes. Waft the steam to your nose until you no longer detect the bite of the alcohol.Then peel and coarsely chop the garlic and ginger. Coarse chop the onions and scallion whites and simmer all ingredients for about a  hour. Remove the skin and roll your pork belly up and tie with butcher twine at at least  places along the roll. Add the entire mixture unstrained to a crock pot on high and cook the skinless pork belly for   hours turning the pork belly about every half hour. Let cool in the fridge and then slice. Before serving lay the pieces on a backing sheet and brown with a torch on both sides. Edit Credit chefjasonpereira for the egg strategy.,ramen,cum2ass,3,t5_2qykd

Not traditional in a sense since it was in the style of pho but it is used with chicken broth ramen noodle medium rare steak beef brisket onions soy sauce soupa sauce Sriracha sauce green onions and a fried egg with a runny yolk.

10877246,0,t1_de1uzoi,Are you using a pasta cutter?I literally go by consistency of the dough and I always start with two cups of flour for my wife and myself.  Ill dissolve some kansui powder in hot water then add that to cold water and pour and knead until its a painintheass to knead.  This goaround I added a small pinch of riboflavin to the flour before mixing everything which made the noodles much more yellow if thats what youre looking for.  After I knead it I let it rest for an hour wrapped in cling wrap and left on the counter.  I dont refrigerate it.So I have no idea what my hydration percentage is or any of that more technical stuff.  Ive never added vital wheat gluten to my noodles as some recipes suggest.  Ill try this sometime.  And Ive always ever used  regular old flour..the cheap stuff.  Theyre always nice and strong they cook quickly  minutes or less theyre chewy and they taste good.  And the soup sticks to them easily.As for the curls theyre really not that curly.  They maybe curl up a tiny bit during the boiling process but before theyre cooked you wouldnt know theyre gonna be curly.I did notice however that the parts of the dough that got sort of pushed and scrunched up on the edges as it was cutting the pasta came out very curly and Im tempted to experiment with this next time.  Maybe try running it through your pasta cutter at a bigger thickness and see what happens.  ,ramen,de1wseh,3,t5_2qykd
