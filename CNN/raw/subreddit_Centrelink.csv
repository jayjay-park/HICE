10674806,0,t1_ddgzi88,How long had you had your degree before you went back? Someone linked me this documentWhich seems to indicate a period of ten years is sufficient to wipe the slate. Im desperately hoping so. The relevant passage is this oneIncomplete studies undertaken more than  years before the student enrolled in their most recent course are disregarded when calculating previous study time.Completed study can be disregarded when calculating previous study time but only if the course was completed more than  years ago. Studies undertaken more than  years ago that are part of a course completed within the last  years are not to be disregarded.Its been well over ten years since I was there. I hope they come to the party on this. At the moment I have to see my DES person every week but Im not on a disability pension and show them the ridiculously unsuitable jobs I apply for just to make the quota for the month. Fucking WOFTAM. I want Austudy so I can stop that shit and concentrate on uni.,Centrelink,ddh0xkd,1,t5_2rgp5
