2751073,0,t1_cngpux2,What did you garrison your MARV with? Depending on the situation there are a few setups that can really helpDPS Sponge  engineersOP killer of all things  zone troopers a rocket squad and an engineer.Ground Control Snipers zone troopers and rockets. There are plenty of combinations so try them and see what works. About the base The big thing Ive seen from competitive players is situational awareness. It wasnt obvious until someone pointed it out to me but placing random basic infantry squads all over common paths can let you know about an oncoming attack miles before it hits. This lets you prepare or move fast response units back to base. Nod can be sneaky so make sure you have a watchtower or a pitbull for stealth detection. Its fairly long and can get dry but I highly recommend watching that Command School series even some of the Red Alert  videos towards the end contain pertinent information as far as tactics go. Just remember that its a game and there arent repercussions for trying outlandish and insane things. One of the first times I went against a brutal AI I won by a power plant two mammoths a guardian turret and some basic infantry.  These dont hurt too much either. ,commandandconquer,cngsall,2,t5_2stve

2982535,0,t3_2uccmo,Normally we do not discuss pirating copies of campc games. The entire collection is a pretty good deal normally and is a great deal on sale. However uSoldierofNod can help you with any problems you may be having. Send him a PM and he can help you get a copy of the game and get it working. Im not  sure that online play works with cracked copies but Im sure he can answer that better then I can. As for free games you can always look at openRA for the first two games And dune . It has online play and much for functionality then the originals. Tiberium sun is comming soon to it but for now we have a free download on our useful links toolbar.

4340460,0,t3_3apvst,CampC is dead. They tried making a new Generals game but that fell through and the developers were shut down. We still have the Tiberium Alliances FP but thats not doing as well as it did before. Think about it this way if EA tried to create a new CampC they would have to make it as mainstream as possible to get new people to play it thus alienating all the longtime fans. Were a nicheaudience that cant justify the creation of a new AAA game. Just look at CampC that was EAs attempt to open up the mechanics to something more appealing to mainstream audiences and it failed miserably and alienated what was left of the fanbase.,commandandconquer,csewew1,12,t5_2stve
4548816,0,t1_ct3xgck,Nope. Final mission is all land and the one before that too iirc. The only cruiser I saw in the allied campaign was one not controlled by you that showed up in a convoy youre supposed to protect that only showed up after I beat all the soviets so it doesnt do anything. Now that I think of it maybe it is possible to build a cruiser in the prefinal mission there is some water there. I was however completely unaware of the cruisers massive range and damage at the time I had yet to finish the soviet campaign and the water is in a strategically unimportant location as it doesnt come anywhere close to the enemy bases so I didnt bother to build a naval base.,commandandconquer,ct403k5,1,t5_2stve

4893540,0,t3_3hucbc,Hello! There are a few unofficial patches that should get it working. Youll probably need to also fix the invisible menu glitch too. Just look up the unofficial patches for them and give it a go. That all being said even when working the game still sometimes has a scroll rate issue. Ive never been actually unable to fix it which makes the game very dificult to play. If you prefer you can try twisted insurrection which is a stand alone mod for Tiberium sun. Fully compatible with newer hardware and you dont need to Tiberium sun to get it to work. Although its is not like the vanilla game it adds a lot more for a lot of fun. Otherwise openRA is coming out with Tiberium sun at an unknowen time. It will be much more close to the vanilla game but the actual release time is unknown still. ,commandandconquer,cubdbuk,1,t5_2stve
