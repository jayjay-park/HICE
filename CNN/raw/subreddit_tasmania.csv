750006,0,t1_cgpdaj2,I work at Stillwater. Definitely hit us up for lunch if you want some top quality lunch food and some of the best service in Launceston. Dinner is something a little more expensive and fancy but well worth it. Also recommend the Black Cow for Dinner.

1544744,0,t1_cj9vv1p,gt The road between Strahan and Burnie can be quite hard going. It is not sealed for a loooong distance just FYI. You can take the highway from Strahan to Burnie via Rosebery . hours or go the Western Explorer which is what I think youre talking about. Personally Id go the Western Explorer for sure if youve got time. Great way to explore the west coast. Driving Hobart to Strahan doesnt look that far on the map but allow . hours plus stops.  The Wall in the Wilderness at Derwent Bridge is worth a look. Pop into Nelson falls on the way and Donaghys Hill.  ,tasmania,cj9wo2w,2,t5_2qnjg

2611898,0,t3_2pqpdh,Ex Tas resident now mainlander here.This will be my th falls in Tassie never been caught always get stuff in here are my tips like another redditor said they randomly search cars generally they focus their more thorough searches on younger people but dont be naive they might still try anyone dont take glass just put it in something else easy to do if they find glass they get grumpy  They search more thoroughly on the th than the th. I think because less people going in so more time if youre taking spirits which is what we do dont take HEAPS of mixers thats a bit of a giveaway for a more thorough search they dont or havent in the past done pat downs so strapping it to the body is possible and usually gets stuff in no worries they are on to the replacing water and re sealing in a slab of water once you get it in dont flaunt it. Plastic cups mixers dont mix in the open be cautious. generally we have never got in trouble or confiscated but just better to be safe.  I have heard of people getting caughtkicked out and not having ticket refunded. So it does happen.My tip be smart dont be blatant and try to take in slabs and slabs unless youve got a false floor and be nice to security and youll be fine!!Absolutely frothing for it.Edit formatting and a few more tips,tasmania,cmzig02,3,t5_2qnjg

9314308,0,t3_58154q,Id like the national parks be open as they were rather than parks passes and return funding back to government.We are actively discouraging young people from exploring our State parks and deterring tourists with entry fees. We are turning our rangers into parking attendants and money collectors. Its a waste of their precious time. Im sure plenty of wealthy people would disagree but they havent seen the Island from the perspective of a backpacker or student.

Then you are left with sending it to auction or putting it on Gumtree. Id recommend a cheap price to get rid of it quicklySelling the car yourself and donating cash will forward the most benefit to people in need.Charities are middlemen in these transactions and are always required to cover their own costs before forwarding benefits.Edit maybe one of the volunteer learn to drive programs could use it,tasmania,dbltvub,1,t5_2qnjg

11173143,0,t1_dexltdo,Whereas I cant understand how it would not be hugely successful.The people who have invested in it seem to agree.  As do the Tasmanian Development Board.  As does Saul Eslake.They have said they will have a capital fund which is primarily designed for major maintenance every  years but can also be used for decommissioning.  Recent comments have suggested it will have a small initial amount which will be incremented by a percentage of revenue each year. Again I dont see why Joe average like you and me should have a right to see the business case of a private company?  We should know that they are paying a fair commercial rate for the land and we should know that they have a fund for decommissioning see capital fund above but it would be incredibly risky to make their private financial details public.Its going to be absolutely packed every cruise ship day every snow day and the week following every day over the summer every school holidays and every day over Dark Mofo as well.  Just about the only visitors to Hobart who dont go up the mountain are those without a car.On one of the radio shows from a couple of weeks ago Adrian Bold said it would be a ballpark figure of about  for a local family to go up.  I dont know what sort of conditions are around that  is it an offseason rate is it a booked in advance rate... is it not valid during school holidays... is local Hobartonly? Tasmania?  I assume it means a family of  adults  children.  I have no idea.  Places such as Australia Zoo etc. have annual passes which are less than the cost of two daily passes.  If the cable car offers a similar deal I can see this being a popular option.,tasmania,deygp0a,1,t5_2qnjg
