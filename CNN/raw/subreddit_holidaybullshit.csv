5145,0,t3_1u6gbm,There are no timestamps on the fronts btw.  Plus it has been brought to light by several members with connections to the postal service that the stamping on the rear of the envelopes in this manner is not a practice the USPS uses... also we have seen a misprint a redditor got a day  stamp on a day  mailer further proof that the post office did not place these timestamps.  There is NO WAY that mail sent out several days later would accidentally end up with a previous timestamp... at least not if the mail was stamped in this fashion by the post offices.  PLUS how insanely coincidental is it that ALL the timestamps just HAPPEN to be the st  primes.. and then when you put them in ascending order just HAPPEN to contain HHMMs that relate directly to a flag code and then just HAPPEN to spell out  words exactly.Seems more far fetched that its NOT on purpose than it being so.,holidaybullshit,cef0tt1,2,t5_2zbv1
10057,0,t3_1u7sxv,How many people got envelopes with the UV luminescent barcodes on the back side? I got them only on Day  Day  and Day  and was wondering if there are others who have them on other days. Since Ive received all  days now wondering if others got them on other days. These barcodes arent picked up in the photos of the envelopes so I wonder if they have some special significance. Mine are as follows using the first and ending lines to line up. There are  positions where its either a line or a space and both ends of all of them are lines. Im guessing that there are only  meaningful bits. The spaces below here are just to make it easier to readDec                Dec                Dec                ,holidaybullshit,cefkw68,2,t5_2zbv1

24059,0,t3_1ud8xx,good work on the anagram theory  but think of it this way.  The word thin thing or think or anything that uses thinthingthink creates hint.  Very common and easy.

And the last thing the hint or clue cant be so obscure that you could pick  possible solutions and not know which one is truly right.  Not a cool puzzle and not the way to do it.

381920,0,t1_cfk8k17,Exactly my thoughts. For a long time now people have been looking at them. If it hasnt been found yet maybe there isnt a hidden message in them? Just because theyre not repeating doesnt MEAN theres a reasoning behind it. Could very well be that they generated a random series for each days envelope.People go so far as to question why they did a certain thing or used a certain word or phrase trying to find some hidden nonexisting meaning.blind alley Must mean Braille!. Heres a definition for the phrase obfuscate Must be important!. Heres a definition for the word But yeah I too would love to be proven wrong about the lights.

412563,0,t1_cfnhuxc,I dont think its obvious but I think theyre logical connections.gtSoldier on despite no x braille characters appearing in the resultThis is just confusing to me. What do you mean you dont find braille characters?gtInterpret braille characters as numbers without the standard braille symbol that usually prefixes numbersYou have  braille characters that are either the letters AJ or numbers. It would be highly unlikely for a message to only use the first  letters of the alphabet so numbers make sense.gtInterpret the result as x  digit numbers rather than as x  character strings like FEELFORGREEN taught us to look for.Is it really that big of a stretch to assume each envelope intersection is a single number? Even if it werent you can look at both data sets and see which one might yield results. The  numbers fall in a particular range. What are you going to do with an  digit number?gtThen the CAH PDFWith  numbers under  in a puzzle by the creators of CAH which happens to have  cards in it the obvious place to look is for a list where the cards are in a certain order. Where else would you look but the official site? The PDF is the only official comprehensive list of all the cards.Yeah there are a lot of steps between the two readable messages but each step of the way is confirmed by the unlikelyhood of mere coincidence.Its a hard puzzle yeah youre going to have to make leaps without knowing for sure youre heading in the right direction. Thats how solving puzzles works. But as it is every step leads toward the next one. Its not a super obvious connection but if it were it wouldnt be a puzzle at all.Too convoluted in this case just means too hard. Well its supposed to be hard.,holidaybullshit,cfnj0rj,0,t5_2zbv1
413293,0,t1_cfnlhiz,Interesting.  For a long time Ive been of the opinion that the drawings on the envelopes were not a part of the puzzle.  So Im not too surprised in that finding.
