1009596,0,t1_chj1nbs,yes yes i understand you did what you do its just that the suspiciousness started before the item drafting had been done even though faceit had confirmed the match  it doesnt seem smart to draft the items as quickly as possible especially since the game had been going on for  and a half hours and  of the community saying that the game should be put on holdpostponed untill everything had been sorted out. btw gotta say i appreciate you answering everything i ask or claim even though youre a very large site you still respond to the small ones.,csgolounge,chj1rf2,-1,t5_2zunm

Because most people dont really care about the way it looks you can use extensions not the way it should be but still. The issue about it being faster can also be attributed to the fact that there have been a lot of new bettors and people using loungedestroyer.

It also makes it impossible to bet below . as you may not get a return. It is morally objectionable as the house edge is . Someone who bets this amount cannot win only lose. I guess the community is toxic enough to view this as strategic scamming as opposed to outright scamming. Scamming is what it is because there is a solution to a problem where skins are taken and it is not implemented due to people just wanting more skins. It is a selfish reason and there is no good argument for it. So far we have heard we want the skins tho and we need the skins tho and its fucking embarrassing.

3703344,0,t3_32qeu1,Okay listen up. Im going to write up a very very rough example. This is why none of you just like myself got nothing in return. This isnt exactly how it works but maybe youll get the idea.Lets say  people bet on a matchTeam   Team The bets on Team were Guy Potential value  Guy PV  Guy PV  Guymost of us  or lessPV The bets on Team Guy  items  item  item item .itemPotential value Team wins!!!! Guy wins  item Guy wins  item Guy wins  itemhe kind of got shafted from his  potential value GuyUS wins The . item because thats all that was leftSince those four items were the only items in the pool they give the highest bettor first dibs thus the largest item that was bet on Teamthis is how max bets get overpay.If csgl could give you the exact amount you were supposed to get back they would. And that would be nice wouldnt it?? But since were dealing with a set number of items and not money that can be divvied up by the penny they can only give away what was bet on Team. In this example if Guy had only bet three items instead of  GuyUS would have received nothing. Which is exactly what happened to some of you. It happens and it sucks I know. But thats betting...,csgolounge,cqeemi2,3,t5_2zunm

3728116,0,t1_cqh6e11,I think you should check your own bets to see if you are getting what you deserve. I usually bet between  and  on odds no worse than  unless on underdog which I will bet on games down to single digits and I never get noticeably raked.  In fact Im certain I get miniscule overpay most times. Anyways  the formula is bet size  value of losing team  value of winning team  winnings.  Obviously CSGL doesnt give exact percentages so you may get paid at . or . on a  game.  If CSGL really took a cut dont you think they would stop the overplays with max bets on  odds. ,csgolounge,cqh8akx,1,t5_2zunm

4244159,0,t3_38d16d,As long as I know OPskins.com is a good website but still isnt at the levels of security as SkinXchanges. While OPskins uses direct PayPal payments and a tokens systems which is really frustating and timewasting SkinXchange also works with any payment card and once the item sells the seller will get this money through a safe passage that prevents any kind of chargeback. This also means that as a seller you can hold your item until it sells If you dont trust the website or you just want to play with it for the last moments of its life. This might delay some of the users deliveries but for sure Its better for sellers and it will attract more users to the website.The Team Support is small YET very quick and powerful. They can help with any kind of problem and at the start when I was still stuck with my bank not sending the code they helped me and I managed to get it and start buying stuff. The team is very active and they keep updating the website with the latest security measures and everything you need to say Im safe here. Support usually answers within one business day as written on the website.Fees while selling are extremely low and the money extracted from those automatically go to Stripe and the SkinXchange website. Items with rare fades patterns phases stickers different looks etc. also have their unique ID in the website and this will make sure that the correct item is delivered.Their website www.skinxchange.comOh and theyre also doing a giveaway right now If youre interested in that.,csgolounge,cs40w1e,1,t5_2zunm
