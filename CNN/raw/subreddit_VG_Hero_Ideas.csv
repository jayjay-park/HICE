5825183,0,t3_3udv4x,Lacks counter play too much escape too much utility for an assassin. Overall seems like a mish mash of random OP things. Needs a clearer outline.,VG_Hero_Ideas,cxj7gdw,1,t5_3am64
6820387,0,t3_4949jc,Hmm ok. Heres my feedback on your hero suggestion. Disclaimer  All comments are with the intention of balance and in game viability no offence intended in anyway or form.. The way you present you idea in this post is a but hard to read so I suggest you format and shift the paragraphs around.. You forgot to add a Heroic Perk its an essential component of any hero in Vainglory.. For the first ability I honestly think its more of a detrimental rather than helpful. The cool down is too flat lined while the cost is far above the damage it gives.. For the second ability I think its to much the stun duration from the first rank is already higher than most stuns in Vainglory. I recommend reworking it.. The ultimate is quite simple but needs more details.Overall needs a lot more elaboration particularly stats. Hope this helps.,VG_Hero_Ideas,d0pe1h8,1,t5_3am64
7038352,0,t3_4c03ew,This hero is amazing. I love the depth you went into and the design of the duo. I think itms really clever how you made a tradeoff with the abilities and passive and what not for instance you get to scout far away but you could still take damage if the enemy attacks the wolf. Great work on this one!,VG_Hero_Ideas,d1e5jdb,2,t5_3am64

7369656,0,t3_4f4i9f,So a few things.One you should have a part describing how the hero looks or an image because I dont fully understand how his ghost plays into his kit visually.Descriptions of abilities should be kept near  sentences just so the post is digestable but well described  though this isnt a strict rule because if the ability has a lot of mechanics you do need to describe them all.So in short remember to show us what your her looks like through images or descriptions and always keep information as compact as possible this post is a bit of a tough read for me personally as I dont have a long attention span.,VG_Hero_Ideas,d2fvncv,2,t5_3am64

7579743,0,t3_4j2fij,I think that the explosions from the B should do damage with a weapon ratio. That way it would be a bit balanced because this means building tons of crystal wont amplify all of your abilities aspects.,VG_Hero_Ideas,d33s3k1,1,t5_3am64
7992386,0,t1_d46thj6, The perk is essentially Rona . and thats not okay to make another hero worth less so no go. A is interesting but it punishes you for landing a  person ability which is not okay usually thats supposed to be rewarded like a  person stun. B is an interesting ability honestly I do like this one but thematically doesnt make sense with her kit. Ultimate is just plain and simply REALLY strong which is sometimes okay on an ult but not of this caliber.,VG_Hero_Ideas,d4ef4uf,1,t5_3am64
8525816,0,t3_4whrf7,This hero sounds really good. He would have a very high learning curve and the B and C may not be entirely possible but he sounds very fun to play. Good job.,VG_Hero_Ideas,d67afz1,1,t5_3am64
