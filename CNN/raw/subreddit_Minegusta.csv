7717238,0,t3_4h1yta,In Game Name RogerName name John Skype jtawnSteam Dont have steam sorry.Age Timezone United KingdomHow often are you on during the week Only just recently found the server was reborn but I can assure you I will be online at least  times a week Depending if Im going up to my Caravan where theres no wifi xDHow long you have played on MG I played for a good few years as you should now though under the name JTawn for the most part.Why do you believe that you should be Mod I am creative active innovative and impartial though most of all I find myself to be trustworthy which is a quality I think is the most important. I hold player satisfaction very highly and so I would do my best to ensure that all players are enjoying themselves and will also make sure that troublemakers get what they deserve! Woohoo oDo you have experience as staff I served as admin for a fair amount of time and enjoyed every second of it. I did become inactive however due to GCSE exams and then by the time I was thinking of returning the server closed down.During my time as admin I gained the experience of issuing mutes kicks bans ipbans and also learned a little Dutch e.g. Bacon smaakt naar Regenbogen Still got it xD. I also learnt the correct and appropriate approach to different situations Spammers Hackers etc.Is there anyone who would be willing to recommend you and speak on your behalf about becoming mod? Not required but it would be nice to see Im not entirely sure who still plays is active though Im sure somebody would vouch for me? .. Please? xDAnyways thanks for reading and lets get Minegusta back in business together! John ,Minegusta,d3jeay5,1,t5_3eclb
