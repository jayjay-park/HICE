5319051,0,t3_3nvfcx,Sweet Leaf is rather obviously about marijuana. And it obviously has a very positive stance towards it. Marijuana is referred to throughout the video as sweet leaf as in the title. In relation to Beckers article the song shows perhaps how people pick marijuana up through influence from others. One of the lyrics is Come on now try it out!  This suggests a sort of pressure from outsiders on another to try it. This reflects how Becker says marijuana is picked up by others. He explains how people can learn to find pleasure in pot via reassurance of peers. This redefinition occurs typically in interaction with more experienced users who in a number of ways teach the novice to find pleasure in this experience which is at first so frightening.  These are connected via the fact that the speaker in the song would be the peer. Perhaps the peers talked about in the article were less pushy but regardless. The speaker would be the one reassuring that it is alright or that what one may have found frightening is actually pleasurable. The song also takes note of a population that is generally more against marijuana than the speaker is. At the end of the songs the lyrics read They put you down and shut you outyou gave to me a new beliefand soon the world will love you sweet leaf.    When the speaker says you he is referring directly to the sweet leaf as if talking to it. They would be the general public who put the sweet leaf down. That means of course that the general public is against it. In Beckers article he says The direction his further use of the drug takes depends on his being able to continue to answer Yes to this question and in addition on his being able to answer Yes to other questions which arise as he becomes aware of the implications of the fact that the society as a whole disapproves of the practice.  This ties into the prior quote from the song but also the song as a whole. Becker notes how the pot user will come to a point where they will support the drug. And they will support it despite the fact that they know society disapproves with them. This is seen in the lyrics via the fact that the speaker acknowledges societys disapproval and yet the entire song itself is basically a lovesong for pot.   ,frccsociology,cvrkkdg,1,t5_36izz
