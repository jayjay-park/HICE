Im still figuring out the best way to talk about some of the things he told me. More soon lead me to believe you thought that Fred and Maura had an incestuous relationship. I thought you also made a comment somewhere about Maura returning to Freds motel room the night of the corolla crash and his comment about finding her naked on the mountain that gave me the same impression.

6021413,0,t1_cy8m9bf,The scanner witness Anne has posted on forums before and... She comes off a little kooky. She is definitely on the police conspiracy train. She is very defensive and insists she is absolutely  sure of what she heard and when. Anyone who questions her or mentions inconsistencies in her story over the years is accused of having an agenda. I believe she feels she is telling the truth but Im just not convinced her memory of that night is entirely accurate. At one point she saidgtI do not think the dispatch times are wrong. I simply cant figure out what we heard.To me that contradicts her sureness of what she heard and I think that is the real truth of the matter. And I dont know who the second scanner witness is unless its just Annes husband. All of a sudden these new supposed witnesses are popping up. Maybe Im mistaken but I dont remember a second scanner witness existing before and I have a hard time believing Columbo has all these secret witnesses no one else knows about or has spoken to.

Its hard to describe other than that I sometimes get the impression that hes a mouthpiece for the Murray familys agenda.

6214354,0,t1_cyvuu4o,I think anything is possible but this is what I find most likely as well.

I cant imagine running into the snowy woods in that kind of cold. By all accounts she was not dressed for that kind of weather and she was very thin. I can see being scared and running down the road eventually accepting a ride from someone. Unless she ran into the woods a good deal before realizing she was lost. But then I have trouble thinking someone well aware of how easily people get lost and perish in those situations would think that was a good idea. I do think its very possible suicide was her ultimate intention but I find it possible yet unlikely that thats how she perished. ,mauramurray,cyw071p,2,t5_3a8p6

Not to mention his wife was home at the time and I might be wrong but that I thought I recalled his elderly mother lived there as well. Being the last known person to see her always leaves that nagging suspicion in your head but I dont think realistically he could have done it. The neighbors all simultaneously turning their attention away from the scene even for a short time pretty much leaves the door open for Maura to leave freely without detection.

The FBI is just waiting for an invite from Law enforcement to jump into this case. Police have a suspects in Mauras disappearance and they are just waiting for the right time to close in on them  or they believe foul play took place and they just are staying mum to the public about a potential killer out and about racking up kills.The FBI have known about Mauras case since the very beginning and have always been available to law enforcement for resources no different than the FBI is always available statebystate for any resident that needs services or assistance.The first very important five years after Maura went missing hundreds of interviews to include FBI interviews of Mauras friends multiple searches The infamous Atm video the supposed sighting of maura and her friends at the grocery store bustons  etc..  the police yielded not a single clue that pointed towards a crime taking place.  Yet the narrative keeps getting spun that police are hiding all this evidence of an abduction or murder or a police coverupconspiracy.I personally dont buy it.,mauramurray,d6hfgiw,1,t5_3a8p6

She would have left all of her stuff there that she would not need over break and packed for the month off clothing wise. Posters would be left on the walls and her bedding be left on the bed if she did not need it over break. We would leave everything we didnt need for break behind. She had a single so she would not have to worry about a room mate staying while she was gone. The fact that things were packed means she intended for someone else to take them back in my mind at least. I think she may have intended to leave and decide on her trip is she would return.

I guess its more pleasant to think about than something violent but it doesnt usually add up.  Theres no way to really know how many people do this though.  Most of the ones we do know about the person had a pretty significant motivation to leave whether they were facing extended jail time escaping abuse or they were just heartless scumbags running away from responsibility.  If you dig deep enough you can find the motivation.  The successful ones cant be counted for statistics.  Did Maura have enough motivation?  With the info that is public I dont see it.

9694373,0,t1_da7ft9l,I can clear some of this upPolice actually copied down the VIN number of the vehicle which led them to call Fred Murrays house in Hanson or Weymouth wherever the family was living.The fact police waited until the following day to begin to try and track down the owner of the car was a clue without official words showing that they werent treating mauras accident as anything but a minor accident.Police actually got a hold of Fred Murray Jr. when they first began calling around in the afternoon hours of Tuesday Feb  .  And Fred Murray Jr. began calling several police departments in an attempt to get a missing persons report filed on his sister however he kept getting the run around.Fred Jr. finally called his sister kathleen who then finally called Fred Murray in the late afternoon hours.   Fred immediately called  with some importanturgent information to pass to them about Maura.Butch Atwoods account of his encounter with Maura unlike it is told   on web forums has actually stayed very consistent.  You may see what seems like different versions but in reality that is the fact that several reporters have approached him at different times over the years with different questions so his answers which are usually very simple can come across as varied when in actuality he is just answering whatever is asked of him and the reporters are filling a lot of his account of the encounter in print with their own summarizing.As far as the witness account of seeing someone looking impaired due to alcohol.  It was either Atwood or the Marottes IMO that had initially said that.  Why that was redacted and scrubbed in future writing about the case is somewhat of a mystery although it was rumored that the Murray family was threatening a  lawsuit about certain things being reported.  It is factual that Fred did threaten lawsuits against the press.Police wouldve only discovered officially that Maura was the driver of that car when they talked to her father Fred on Feb   just before  p.m.   Unofficially they knew a young adult female was the driver based on the account of Atwood.,mauramurray,da81cox,1,t5_3a8p6

Because of the notes contents as reported The note was likely meant for Billy.Once again and I cant stress this enough   Police mention a personal note left by maura they dont say they recovered a suicide note.  That is a big difference.But IMO in trying to stay in front of reporters questioning whether or not Maura was suicidal which ended up never really happening family felt like they had to defend the note and only then did it get referred to as a suicide note or that the police were pushing this suicide note.,mauramurray,dak3o6e,2,t5_3a8p6

Something to get a hot radiator cap off to wipe your hands on after changing a tire or adding fluids. Also Fred says he gave the towel to Maura and told her to use it in the pipe to slow down exhaust so she wouldnt be stopped by cops. So at first only she and Fred knew about his method of slowing down emissions. Who else would she likely tell about the rag and how Fred told her to use it? It has to be somebody she told.

Enough to arouse suspicions and good enough reasons for LE to check on why a Mass plated car is driving around here. Enough to follow up on and pursue the car for a possible stop. LE on slow nights will follow unsuspecting cars for many miles just to get a hit on something. Its happened to me tons of times. If the Saturn was trying to escape being seen by LE or from being stopped for whatever reason then going a little too fast would have spun the car out at the corner. No one has thought that maybe Maura DID change her mind and started walking towards BAs house. Then didnt make it as the following vehicle came upon her. If it was LE that showed up then BA would not be worried until days later when he finds out that Maura is now missing.

11147241,0,t3_5yu43v,I think one explanation is that the family wanted to divert attention away from the rag in the tailpipe because back then it was inextricably associated with the suicide theory and they wanted to diver attention away from the suicide theory so that people  LE wouldnt stop looking for Maura.,mauramurray,devj0jc,5,t5_3a8p6
11269152,0,t1_df3iaqe,Youre right Bill. Assuming the daughter informed the father that k couldve been used for any number of things. Except it wasnt. The family reported long ago that money was reaccounted for and was redeposited.,mauramurray,df9cb58,1,t5_3a8p6

11305542,0,t1_dfdas33,I dont shut down her reporting I just didnt find anything of value to it.  So what she thinks she saw a cop car with a certain number on it. It doesnt prove murder doesnt prove anything concerning maura. I would need something else to go with that otherwise what she has said really hasnt added anything new.,mauramurray,dfdgsmi,-1,t5_3a8p6
11367147,0,t1_dfjnfvs,Who let the DOGS out??? Woof woof woof......Wouldnt people shake in their lil boots then............Maybe she can use something of Mauras that is actually useful? Scents can go away but dogs trained in cadavers can find things  years later.......cut em loose.......,mauramurray,dfkg00n,2,t5_3a8p6

11562389,0,t3_5hz6qh, believe that butch is fully responsible. He was a local who knew she was in a spot that had no cell phone service. I think the opportunity presented itself. He absucted her or offered her a ride raped her tied her up in his truck possibly came home and called the police to cover his tracks on her eventually killed her and disposed her in a way that no one would ever find her. I dont care if his wife or mom was home. Plenty of killers do this shit right under anyones nose. I fully believe it was butch. Simple and easiest explanation. ,mauramurray,dg6lnyr,1,t5_3a8p6
