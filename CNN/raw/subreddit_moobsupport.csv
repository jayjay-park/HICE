I remember being in denial of even looking it up and just being totally embarrassed by it. like a drug addict with a problem but wont admit haha but yeah man I had my surgery about  years ago and it has changed EVERYTHING. I actually have a tan on my upper body and its not a short sleevetank top tan line and I dont even think about it now. You realize how paranoid you were constantly every day and its such burden taken away after surgery! good for you man fuck gyne,moobsupport,d2r7wzt,1,t5_330bo
