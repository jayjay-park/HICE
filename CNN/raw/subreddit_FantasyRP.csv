We live humbly to distance ourselves from the desires and temptations of material wealth we train our swords to lift in defense of those who cannot summon the strength to do so and we pass through the shadows to strike down all who threaten the order of life he explained in a matter of fact way.  To embrace the shadow is to embrace the light that casts it.  Thats a part of our creed you see.  Many look at us at first glance and associate our skills with wrongdoing.  But thats not the case!

So I joined the army. I rose in the ranks slowly but surely. Then my city was attacked under siege. I was chosen to be a leader of a large group of men who were to sneak out and launch a surprise counteroffensive on horseback against the attackers. But...  Silmar suddenly frowned completely lost within his past.  We failed. Only a dozen men and I survived. But we had no way of getting that information over to the main army. So we sneaked into the attackers troops and tried once again to destroy them. And again we failed and I was the only one to survive. I fled on my horse scared for my life. I later learned that the city had been completely overrun. I had been marked as a traitor. An outlaw. I tried to go back but they knew who I was. So they went on a manhunt. And thats...thats when the real hatred started to burn. Over dozens of years hundreds even thousands of men attempted to get my head. Every time they failed the price for my head increased until finally I was considered so dangerous that they sent out a group of a dozen elvish warriors led by an elf by the name of Aeriol. They tracked me down into the mountains. One by one we slowly fought until it was just me and Aeriol in the mountains. We knew someone wasnt getting off the mountain alive. We were fighting for days until I cast a spell that even I cannot remember. It bound our souls and created a horrific beast out of it. Parts of our souls remained intact however and now in a state beyond life or death we fought for years and years. And then he left me on the verge of death thinking that I was truly dead after receiving a strike to the neck. But I dragged myself off of that mountain all the way down to the forest. There a wizard found me. After attempting to heal me he realized who I was and tried to kill me. Surprisingly he failed. After that I hunted him down for months. And then I took his life. But before I did he cast a spell that put me into a deep sleep right before I plunged my blade into his chest. And now thousands of years later I have awoken.   sorry about the wall of text.
