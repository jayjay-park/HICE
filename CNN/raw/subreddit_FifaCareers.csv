There is a moment at the very start of the game where based on the way the CPU is playing I just think oh so Im supposed to lose this one.The only advice I can offer is to change your tactics.Oh  also  Marseille are just one of those teams who play very aggressively and constantly on the counterattack. I always have trouble with them too. There arent many teams like that in the game but Marseille have been one of them for the last couple of releases. My advice is to play deep with a longball approach.,FifaCareers,cegbx5a,1,t5_2tzz3

Ive played about  games like this and im slowly going to ween myself off this handicap.  Ive been winning most games by at least  and  possession so its time I give the cpu more juice.I just wish that ea could balance the difficulty better.

901417,0,t3_24fpln,Im American as well. I used to play soccer though but wasnt too familiar with the European leagues or teams other than Chelsea Man U Barca and Real Madrid. While they arent the clubs I support now they were the only teams I knew so I started a career mode with Real Madrid. They had great stats and a huge transfer budget. I bought the best players and the players with the best potential to dominate the competition. I also started watching more soccer outside of the MLS. I got into the Premier League and the Bundesliga and fell in love with Manchester City. I now use them for all my CMs.I would suggest watching a bit of Euro soccer football as they call it and finding a team that you like the style of play of or watch MLS and find a club that you like. Most Americans support bigger Euro clubs like Man City Man U Barca Real Madrid Bayern Munich or Borussia Dortmund so those are probably teams youll watch and use for a CM. As for building teams theres a website www.fifafanatic.com  that you can use to find players with good potentials and high rated players since you probably only know of Ronaldo and Messi.

933406,0,t3_24sxag,I mean everyone is entitled to their opinion but the fact is unless we have an official source from EA that tells us either way none of us really know.However there is a lot of anecdotal evidence that makes me think that regens might exist.  Ive seen quite a few over the career modes Ive played for instance in one season Ivanovic Thiago Motta Dani Alves had moved to Dortmund and Etoo all retired.  These are all relatively unique players in terms of their nationalityleague combination.  The following season I found high potential young players with matching league and nationality to all  of those guys.  Coincidence?  Id venture to guess that its not a coincidence.  Also in a new career mode I thought Id see if a Del Piero regen existed in the rd season and lo and behold theres a high potential  year old Italian striker playing in the Australian league.

2301259,0,t3_2lkf37,Pretty obvious but if you want to sell one of your players make him play in preseason friendies. Often its against weaker opponents so he easily become inform which makes him sell easier. My other advice would be unless you run a massive team dont be too picky with youth players. Scouting for players costs money and the more value you get out of it the better. So what if you get a player with  overall and  rated. Send him out on loan and next season even if you sell him for as little as k its a massive profit. The wages are basically peanuts so it really wont cost you too much to bring in youth players that you dont need.When I started playing career I only accepted players with  potential but if you cant afford good scouts you cant expect  OVR players right out of the academy.,FifaCareers,clw5hlr,1,t5_2tzz3

Its already pretty decent but it just needs some relatively minor tweaks to make it much more enjoyable Transfers need to be revamped. Highly rated players shouldnt be sold so easily to other big clubs. Clubs should be renewing a players contract if hes a star and there should be much less frequent precontract transfers. Teams should be buying more depth signings. Loans should be much easier to get. Being able to dictate a release clause or minimum acceptable offer amount for players so you dont have to deal with random teams lowballing your players. Youth system overhaul. Go away with the youth academy and have players you sign automatically sent to a U team that you can only sim but your players develop in instead of a May update. Having more realistic stats and growth to start out with. Speed improvements. Its crazy how the mode is just as slow on next gen as old gen. Why are the loading times so long? Why is there menu lag before Champions Cup or Euro League matches? Why does starting a new season take like  minutes?  Minor fixes that should be in this version like the broken name generator for scouts and youth players editing a player causes them to wear short sleeves in Winterrainysnowy games growth getting stuck for some players and generated players having dull looking profile pictures that are wrong. ,FifaCareers,co5spnm,20,t5_2tzz3

Theyre a very real annoyance thats part of the job and I think its valuable despite not liking them that theyre included and furthermore because I do think theres a small chance of them impacting your teams performance. I know theyre repetitive and annoying but you can see from the managers faces they dont particularly like them either but theyre a part of the job even if they amount to nothing at all.I actually tried taking up the India job with the intent of getting into the World Cup as an extra little challenge and I enjoyed it but I dont get to play as often as I would like and so eventually grew weary of it slowing down my club career.

Do Sunderland with Brit Isle only no purchases over m pounds and heavy utilization of your youth academy and I would be very surprised if you ax your save due to boredom too quickly. The thing is with Brit Isle only saves is you only really need one top notch pro scout and to put him in England. As you get wealthier itd probably be worth putting one in Scotland eventually but nonetheless this allows you to allocate even more funds all the earlier to your youth academy and begin pumping out top quality youth. ,FifaCareers,cqpbugb,3,t5_2tzz3

Always make passes to him in that position as a give and go and once he gets the ball make sure you hold down LTXbox to guard the ball. Then when the player who passes the ball just use him as and option to lay off too or pass off to another player. Using this in proper situations can shift the defence and open up all types of holes ,FifaCareers,cr7c2ka,1,t5_2tzz3

I agree that the stubbornness is due to lack of options preferable to Poch but I still think he could have used a bit more whats the deal with Stambouli for instance? and as for me personally I think he should have recognized this by the winter and tried to have been more aggressive in January in at least making one or two moves. I find it particularly surprising how he handled the attacking midwinger positions as we were clearly lacking in depth but he made no acquisitions allowed one senior player to go on loan didnt recall Pritch and allowed our most physically developed youth at the positions to also go out on loan.

After completing your season you get to go through the countries and leagues and actually chose the club you wanted to manage next year.

Going back to Atari baseball in the s Baseball Stars amp Tecmo BowlSuper Bowl on NES EA Baseball Triple Play amp MVP and NHL Hockey starting in the s NBA Live and NBA k Madden NCAA football etc.  Most of these games have had some sort of careerfranchiseetc mode over the past  years or so and NONE have ever done anything so blatantly stupid as FIFA.  You built up a roster of dominating players by trading all your draft picks in NBA K?  Guess what you are kicking everyones ass.  You start an NCAA football dynasty with Troy State?  Yeah you are gonna suck for a while and lose a lot. But you recruit amp build up your dynasty over a couple of seasons and get a good team?  Your gonna start having some fun and putting up some stats.  If you have a team full of  rated players in FIFA and you go against a team of s you should kick their asses.  Yeah your gonna miss some shots and probably be complacent etc.  But to just deliberately handicap your players for being better?  Thats just fucking lazy programming.  Whats the point of building up a good roster when the game engine just levels the playing field by artificially reducing all of those players abilities?  The whole purpose of CM is to build your team the way you want it but nothing you do matters and none of those  different category ratings mean shit if the games just decides its time for you to lose.  I have played sports video games and almost no other genre basically my whole life and to me this is worst feature in an otherwise solid game that I have ever seen.

4418613,0,t1_csnp8zx,Well usually the biggest barrier to climbing division is players because you dont have a lot of money to buy good players so you have to do a lot of scouting so you can find good players to keep so you can get promoted as well as find a lot of players to sell so you can build up your financials to bring in bring players who are quality. I currently just started another league  career mode. As far as formation it depends on the difficulty you are playing on. Im currently playing on legendary and in the Lord divisions I find that its better to have two strikers or More midfielders. Look to win a lot of games  or . FIFA has done an absolutely terrible job of implementing new features in career mode with every release its basically the same game it was  years ago so it can get blend pretty quickly if you dont find ways to keep yourself interested.

Im in the second year now and I got transferd for . million to LA Galaxy. Year after I was sold for . million to Sevilla. First I wanted to see if I got picked because they had a  rated striker so. Lucky for me this striker got injured for  months. Even when he recovered Im the starting striker. DMy rules  if you are a ST   Choose a nationality look at the current starters for the national teams and pick a team that hasnt a good striker max  rated. Choose a team Choose a low rated team that has a striker that is lower rated than your own rating.  Play at least in  different leagues. The league you start in doesnt count. You have to win the golden boot and the title at the team. After you completed that hand in a transfer request.   You only can only play for  team per league. End up at a team that hasnt at least a  striker at the start of your career as you cant see what team has what striker and be the star of the team. so no Man city or United no PSG no Barcelona because of Aguero rooney  RVP Zlatan amp suarez  messi for example The boots. Start of with basic boots. Look at the brand on the shirts if they play with Nike Adidas or Puma choose the first available boots of that brand. If they play with a less known brand choose Warrior Umbro or different boots.Challenge completed? You can play for whatever team you like. Need some more challenges?

5218969,0,t3_3mgxr5,Weird. Im not having this problem at all and Im playing with a League  team in the first season which means that most of my players are between  OVR.But I changed formations and I switch a lot from Balanced to Attacking while playing. This is a good change from the previous games switching it now makes team mates come back more or stay in the attack accordingly to your plan pressing or else. Maybe trying to change certain things in your custom tactics might help for example type of passes and such also asking them to Run Behind in your formation or to Open Wide and such will change things. But all of them will happen accordingly with the stats of the player so players with low Attacking Position will behave badly in this situations.Another idea is to push them a bit back from the formation since you dont want them inside the opponents defense just switch them to a more midfield placed striker and or switch fo a false  position. ,FifaCareers,cvf2tcv,1,t5_2tzz3

If the bottom defender passes it left head towards the left side of the top player and if he passes it to the right then to the right side of the top player. Ive noticed that if the bottom player passes it right theres a small chance hell pass it back to the bottom defender. If thats the case try to reset the ball.

For instance if you just increase the slider for the amount of runs your team make theyll definitely attempt to make more runs but nothing may come of it. But if you also turn down the marking slider then said players making runs wont be marked as closely and you might be able to get the ball to them.But in turn making changes to the marking slider will either open up or close space in other areas of the pitch and youll already be marked too tightly to make that pass in the first place or youll have too much open space in front of you and just make the run yourself.Its like cause and effect its either something you have to experiment with for a while and figure it out you can spend hours changing sliders and still not get any good results. If youre not comfortable with that google or search fifa forums and theres plenty of users out there whove already put out slider sets for people to use.,FifaCareers,cwe5s6h,1,t5_2tzz3

6156155,0,t3_3zv725,Are you using much possession? Are you trying to overwhelm with power?Unfortunately theyve really pushed one type of play this year. Its incredibly important to use agile players who can quickly whip the ball around in possession. If you have big central midfielders who you became acclimatized to pushing the opposition in lower leagues around with they may be a part of the problem. You need speed agility and good passing stats to succeed this year. While this is the direction of the modern game I think one of the joys of FIFA has historically been the ability to play whatever style you damn well please. While this style coincidentally plays into the style of my own I still think it a bit forceful that EA have chosen to take this route.So prioritize the above stats this year more than power and strength and you should start to see more lanes open. Also EA left a major weakness in the CPUs defending this year with your players turning in the box. Use possession pass the ball around he edge of the box find an open man have him turn again agility important and finesse shot near post. Once you get this down the game literally becomes too easy. Hope this helps best of luck!,FifaCareers,cype29r,2,t5_2tzz3

6284411,0,t3_41ldu2,Im actually currently doing this exact same thing with Inter lowering average age rebuilding a stronger team and making the core of the team Italian again. I was undecided between Inter and AC when starting but ultimately opted for Inter purely based on kits dont ask why I prefer them I just do and Its nice to see how someone approached the same thing with AC Id love to hear some more about this maybe an update a season or  down the line. One suggestion I would have with me currently being . seasons in is to try and get the Italy national team job helps find regensnewgens and also the best Italians to sign I found a very impressive newgen RB and Tottis regen using the national squad call up screen which have been great additions to the squad especially since they arent the typical Italians to sign in career mode Berardi Insigne Ruganil Gabbiadini etc. Another way Ive found to keep the career from going stale is rather than ONLY signing Italians as your options are very limited try just keeping a certain percentage of the squad Italian I am currently working at  or higher of a  man squad Im not quite there yet but after the current January window I should be able to make the moves I need to get there I also limit myself to fielding only  foreign players at a time so I sub on Guarin for example Id have to take of Brozovic rather than Gabbiadini or whatever just makes it so that if you really want to bring in a player like Halilovic you can as well as greatly increasing your pool of players. As I said Id love to hear move of this perhaps in a proper write up if you want top do that kind of thing.,FifaCareers,cz3yt8k,2,t5_2tzz3

6699182,0,t3_47e4g8,Dont worry about it. The reason why is that theyve hanged the gameplay this ear to really push the modern possessionoriented game. In doing so they massively blunted both crosses and long balls. Ergo its not something wrong that youre doing at all.Im personally a fan of the more cognitive possessionoriented game but I dont think EA should have done this. Part of the joy of this game has always been the ability to individualize ones style of play and I believe this is the first year where theyve ever actually violated that.Personally I dont ever play with a target man anymore. To be frank theyre useless his year. My strikers tend to be no more than  and agile and creative enough to participate in the ground buildup. I also never use traditional wingers anymore and use only inverteds. While this better suits my style of play I cant help but fee for those who preferred the good ol fashioned power target man style as this change is just not entirely fair to them. Hopefully in the future EA will be able to figure out a better balance to reflect realism. For now though just know that it the problem isnt at all anything that youre doing wrong.,FifaCareers,d0c94qk,3,t5_2tzz3

7579829,0,t1_d33rl7t,Wow what an awesome reply! I definitely get why certain potentials are what they are. I was more just asking whether people think potentials should be as realistic as possible or stray on the side of optimism. Personally I think thats a discussion worth having since it is a video game after all and theres an inexact balance that has to be kept between realism and fun. I think making an Odegaard have really high potential more like Mastour and giving someone like Morris a higher potential gives CM players more exciting prospects to try out. Of course letting us completely adjust a players stats WF skill moves wr potential etc would be my preference. That way Im not as reliant on EA to scout a certain prospect well. I would personally be more lenient with potential and much more lenient with skill moves. If I see a player do an elastico more than once thats enough for me to give them five star skills. Because ultimately I want to be able to take a player in FIFA and replicate what they can do in real life. After all I may not know whether someone like Hazard can do a sombrero flick but if Ive seen him do several elasticos then he should be able to do them in game.,FifaCareers,d33sg6v,2,t5_2tzz3

The FIFA series has a big enough budget to do a proper career mode without having to sell it separately as a we are too greedy to sell you a complete gameDLC. A lot of the suggestions shown in this sub which I believe is indicative of what players generally want are either relatively simple or features that were in previous FIFAs.

9398472,0,t3_599x0i,Havent played on Bundesliga  but on my career i started with Cambridge United which plays in the th div of english football. Im midway my third season jan window and topping the second division table. I wont remember every single player so I will list those who stood out.When i mention training bear in mind that i mostly do manual training of my players and get consistently As and sometimes will settle for a B just so i dont waste time training more than playing games lol. If i get a B first try i wont retry but mostly get As first try anyways in BYM CC ERP and both GK sessions but am not that good in ERD. I highly recommend doing CC a few times as it really helps getting to know better how to shoot in this new edition driven shots are insanely good even more when combined with finesse.Training Sessions CC  Chance Creation BYM  Beat Your Man ERP  El Rondo passing ERD  El Rondo DefendingSeason  Thomas Amang Bought him in the first window very cheaply trained a lot of CC and BYM. He was rated  when the third season started and I sold him for m. Van Bergen Bought him for around k euros in the first window trained him a lot in BYM CC and ERP in the first two seasons but never on the third. Hes currently rated  with insane pace  finishing  passing. Rafik Zhekhnini Bought him in the first window for k and a k valued player. Was rated  when I sold him the second seasons mid window for m. Trained CC BYM and ERP Dongou Tsafack Bought him in my second window around .m IIRC. Trained lots of CC and a little BYM. Currently rated  but on the sidelines injured Kaya Bought him cheaply trained some ERD currently rated  or . Konigsmann Very good and very cheap bought for around k. Got straight As in training and sold him for .m mid season around  OR. Trained a youth academy GK which would follow the same steps. Money allowed me to buy tsafack and others on contract. Youth Acadmy GK After selling Konigsmann i trained this GK to around  OR and sold him for a lil over m when the second season started? Dont really remember the price but around that mark.Season  Rodri Signed on precontract in the st season. Mostly a just a filler in case one of the better strikers got injured. Sold when the third season started. Farkas  Signed on precontract in the st season. Mostly a just a reserve. Sold when the third season started and replaced with a youth academy player. Agudelo Signed on precontract in the st season. Very good player for the third division and decent on the second division. Currently rated  but is my th striker in the second div. Videmont Signed on precontract in the st season. Decent cover for the wings but not more than that. Sold when the third season started for around .m Valcarce Signed on precontract in the st season. Very good player for the third division but swapped him midway the season for Rico Henry Rico Henry My favorite LB for the lower leagues insane pace and stamina wont let you down. Currently rated  Elliott Hewitt Swapped for my main RB.  Very good player for the third division and decent on the second division. Remains as my RB as the board limited my wage growth for the third season currently rated  IIRC Gaston Romero Bought him cheaply when the season started. Trained a little of ERD. Sold when the first season started for m around  OR. Solid player. Mile Svilar Very good GK bought him as soon as I sold my YA GK for a few millions. Trained lots of times and got straight As. Currently rated  and was offered mi for him midway third season which i was dumb to ask for a lil more and lost the offer. Pulisic Very good winger trained lots of BYM and some ERP his dribbling was above  when i finished. Highly recommend him as he wasnt expensive and grew quickly. Bought him midway second season and swapped him at overall  midway third season for a  rated Matheus Pereira. Machach Dont really remember how much i paid for him but wasnt very expensive. Solid CM very good at dribbling and passing. Swapped him in the third season midway for Hoon   m. Onguene Solid and strong CB. Currently in the first  with  overall. Trained some ERD. Duiedar Got as free agent to be my rd choice CB at  OR. Sold when the third season started for k. Etoo Regen Bought him in the second seasons mid window at overall  trained lots of CC and some BYM. Currently my main striker with  overallSeason  Pirlo regen Bought him in the start of third season. Trained lots of BYM and he currently has  ball control  dribbling   stamina along his natural good passing above  both short and long. My favorite CM so far. Bought for m and currently rated . Drogba regen bought him for less than m after I sold amang for cover since i promoted etoo to main striker and had tsafack as a very good reserve. Been training a lot of CC and he is already rated . Hoon Ive just bought him at  for Machach  m havent had the opportunity to play with him yet waiting to get home to try him lol seems veeeeery good and well rounded. Fede Got him in the start of the third season for around m. Solid CDM all around. Currently  OR. Matheus Pereira Swapped a  Pulisic for a  Pereira no cash needed. Even though i really enjoyed Pulisic Pereira wages were half of his and had better Pace and Finishing but worse passing and dribbling. What made me buy pereira though beyond the wages THANK YOU BOARD. was the  star skill moves I reaaaaally enjoy it. Scored one and had one assist on his debut. Looks promising. Dabrowski Signed on precontract in the nd season. Solid CDMCM but was severely lacking in stamina. Sold him midway third season to get money and lessen the wage growth. David Mayoral Bought him as cover for Van Bergen when the season started after I sold the remaining RM from the original squad. Trained lots of BYM to get his stamina up. Hes not thaaat good but his pace is insane and has  agility. Currently  OR. Luque Signed on precontract in the nd season. Very good pace bt lacks in finishing.

9428782,0,t3_59ooe7,Personally  I say noWhile I agree with a lot of people FIFA  has fixed a lot of issues that FIFA  has at the same time as youd expect from EA theyve created a lot more in their place. As a Career Mode only player like yourself I bought FIFA  but Ive already sold it and decided to stick with FIFA . Career Mode is nigh on identical so if you dont care that much about roster updates I just manually transferred the relevant summer transfers in and out of my chosen team before starting anyway then Id almost say its pointless to spend  on a nearly identical game. Plus in my opinion I couldnt be bothered to have to work around all the constant patch updates that EA will be releasing over the coming months. As someone who has very specific sliders to make the game feel as realistic as possible at least with FIFA  you know its the finished article now and nothing will change. Unlike with FIFA  where you might settle for one particular group of settings only for that to then need to be completely reworked next month when another patch is released. Ultimately Ive realised that EA dont really care about Career Mode players like us so to buy their games with that mode in mind hoping itll be a smooth experience is an exercise in futility.,FifaCareers,d9b5vex,1,t5_2tzz3

Then I input the stats whenever I have time or whenever my wife is playing Witcher  lol.  Its pretty sweet. I changed it somewhat by adding sections for league champions cup domestic cup domestic super cup amp euro super cups combined and preseason tournaments that all feed into a totals sheet for all caps.

9497025,0,t3_5at153,Ive been facing the same issue with mental stats if you dont train them they dont grow well. For ex I have CM who grew naturally without any training they have  long and short passing but vision in the early s. The same also applies to pretty much all the positions. The stamina growth is also poor on the wingers. They only thing you can do is to train them. I usually send my youth players on loan but once they are above  I get them some matches in my team and over the period of  years I fix the mental and stamina of all wingers CM and Strikers replacing my team with a full youth team. Atleast the positive side is that there is no physical growth stunting. But I really think EA needs to fix the shit mental growth. Another example I can give is that I am yet to see any youth player who has a composure above  when the OVR is  and I have done  years of several CM. Also dont worry about physical growth stunting I have yet to see that a problem and I have done a lot of CM. As I said I train around  and leave it around  if they have potential to be special never saw any growth being stunted. ,FifaCareers,d9jpl5u,3,t5_2tzz3

9522115,0,t3_5b9gli,Doing my traditional startoffifa Chelsea career mode right now. Im  games into the season atm and Im off to a pretty good start in first place on  points. Im playing a  with the CAMs pushed out a bit wider playing as wingers and the CDMs pushed forward into CMs. Those CMs are the key part of my play style. They need to be solid box to box midfielders with high stamina as they do a lot of running. I mainly rotate between Kante  William Carvalho  van Ginkel  and Renato Sanches  based on form but the best performers so far have been Sanches and Kante.A fair few of my signings last year struggled to find their feet in the team which had been worrying me mainly Carrasco  Inaki Williams  Che Adams  and Lukaku . But in the last few months most of them have improved dramatically. I think this is mostly due to me understanding how to use them properly and stop trying to force them to do things beyond their abilities.   The only exception is Lukaku who has been struggling to score in important matches mostly scoring of the bench late in games that are already over. But he has been improving slightly so I have hope that before too long hell become the goal scoring machine I hope he can be.Ive got some solid youth prospects who are developing nicely. The standouts so far have been  A   YO english GK  who far outplays his stats and is my nd choice keeper  A   YO english CB  who plays very well for his overall and should develop nicely into a nd choice player  A   YO Spanish CAM with solid technical stats but he hasnt played much yet so Im not sure how hell turn out. Theres also a   YO English CB  in my academy with some very solid physicals who I plan to promote once Ive trained his defensive stats a bit more. He could make a great st team player one day.My top  players would be Diego Costa  Lacazette  Hazard  Renato Sanches  and Courtois.    Costa and Lacazette were a brilliant strike partnership last season with Costa getting the Golden boot and Lacazette getting the most assists.    Hazard also did fantastic last season with something like  goals and  assists in all competitions but he did so much more then those stats say. Hes crucial to a lot of my build up play and gets plenty of pass to assists as well.   Sanches really started to come into his own late last season scoring some very important goals and injecting some passion into the team when its needed most. His longshots sometimes take a while to get on target but once they do theyre deadly.   Theres not much a need to say about Courtois apart from the fact that he missed about  months last season due to injury and still won the golden glove by about  clean sheets.Last season I won a treble PL EFL cup and CL however this season Id really like to get the FA Cup PL and CL treble. But my main focus will be the CL and PL. Im really excited to see how this career goes as I think I have a good chance of becoming the best team in the world in the next  years.Sorry about the wall of text I didnt even realise how much Id written till the end hope someone finds it interesting.,FifaCareers,d9mswm4,8,t5_2tzz3

Hes destroyer playmaker and boxtobox all at once. When we got a midfielder sent off I didnt even notice because Denisov was doing business as usual.CM Sosnin  a tuttocampista who was filling in for injury but stayed.

Zenit make use of free transfers to lure in big players Dzyuba Arshavin and Timoschuk for example and they prey on talented players from other Russian league clubs. The caveat is that Spartak and CSKA would rather go bankrupt before selling to Zenit so you need to monitor players from smaller Russian teams and see which ones can you use and resell later. Outside free transfers mostly used for Eastern European players Zenit usually shop in Italy and Portugal.TLDR  Experienced players through free transfers local talent that can reach  OVR and spend the earnings in Serie A and Primeira Liga.,FifaCareers,dd04p0e,3,t5_2tzz3

11445751,0,t3_63bf7s,Ajax was my st CM in Fifa  and that was before they added D. Neres and before J. Kluiverts nice upgrade. Right now they are ready to go right out of the box nothing needed imo. Just start the CM wthe squad as is and enjoy all of those green stats. Especially if you are in EFL League  you wont have any competition. Your biggest challenge will be keeping your players happy with playing time etc.,FifaCareers,dftd6fc,2,t5_2tzz3
