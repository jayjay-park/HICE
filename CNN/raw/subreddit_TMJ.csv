152514,0,t3_1viz4j,Ive had  surgeries and been on a pain management course which pasted  weeks so if you have any questions please ask. In terms of injections the best are anesthetic ones and Botox ones. Botox injected into theMuscles paralyses the muscles and should help with spasms. And the anesthetic should giveA little pain relief. You need to be referred to a tmj specialist and have an MRI scan to determine the state of your joint.Im waiting for a total jaw joint replacement and you really dont want to get this far. Hope youre okay!,TMJ,cevswtr,2,t5_2t0ha
1709554,0,t3_2dzglg,It will be okay. I felt really similar to you when I first started having TMJ symptoms. I had horrible anxiety and depression I had a panic attack last night actually because of the pain. I thought life was never going to the same. TMJ is complicated and isnt really easy to fix but there are plenty of things you can do to cope with it. The anxiety definitely makes it worse because you are probably clenching your jaw muscles and not realizing it. You are doing the right things though seeing a doc and a dentist. I also found a lot of relief after seeing a chiropractor  someone who knows how to work with TMJ. Some other suggestions for you  get a comfortable firm pillow and make sure you are sleeping on your side with your neck and jaw supported even sleeping on your back is good too. Do not sleep on your stomach. Also make sure you are practicing good posture  no slouching because it can put stress on your neckjaw. This is obvious but avoid all crunchy foods  stick to a soft diet when your pain is flaring up. No caffeine. Stick to a good exercise regime  yoga is great for your muscles thus making your neck and jaw more relaxed. There is a great support group on Facebook for TMJ. ,TMJ,cjung6g,3,t5_2t0ha
2274048,0,t3_2l9eg5,I think it depends on your case but from what Ive learned a couple things need to happen first for braces to be successful with relieving symptoms. Your jaw needs to be stabilized by normalizing muscle activity and reducing inflammation. Most people do this by wearing some kind of splint. After youre able to stabilize your jaw position then braces are put on to maintain the results. ,TMJ,clsshvy,3,t5_2t0ha

2926282,0,t3_2tnxtz,Ive used a baby toothbrush for the past  years normal sized ones dont fit and hurt. As for seeing a dentist I have to be heavily sedated for check ups and for fillings. Had  surgeries and just had my jaw replacement in august. Hope this answers your question  feel free to ask more if you like,TMJ,co0q7p8,1,t5_2t0ha
3134878,0,t1_comwt6u,Perhaps try to find one who works in a clinic not one who is about holistic medicine and wellness. Certainly theres a holistic aspect to osteopathy but my experience was not like that. She really was working on muscles manipulations. And those who are TMJ specialists will include that in their bios and credentials.,TMJ,comxe33,1,t5_2t0ha
3502494,0,t3_30989o,I had bilateral arthrocentesis   weeks ago today and it worked!...for  weeks. Started getting loud popping and clicking again last night this time on the side that wasnt previously bothering me at all. Such a bummer its really a let down after getting so excited that maybe your tmj pain was gone for good. I need to find a way to stop clenching at night. Had you had it before this time? Did it help? ,TMJ,cpric9p,1,t5_2t0ha
3666698,0,t3_32c818,I dont think you should be seriously worried...but I DO think you should get it checked ASAP.It may be within the range of normal symptoms Im not sure but its definitely not common. The kind of swelling and sudden onset that you are describing sounds more like acute injury to the jaw joint or some kind of infection. Of course you might just have mildly injured your jaw chewing gum   hours is a LONG time to chew gum!!I am a massage therapist who works with TMJD. Ill be the first to admit that I have not seen every possible configuration. In my line of work there is always something new and weird to discover. That said I have never seen anything quite like what you are describing.Dont panic but dont dismiss it as just TMJD either. Since this started suddenly and is accompanied by swelling you shouldnt be treating it like a chronic repetitive strain type of injury. Go get it checked out. ,TMJ,cqa887v,1,t5_2t0ha
4408569,0,t3_3b7fl9,Im having a consultation and hopefully a fitting to get one today. I hope it helps. I wear an NTI at night and it seems to make me clench even harder. Do you take them out to eat?,TMJ,csmkws5,1,t5_2t0ha
4685176,0,t3_3f3ulz,I would say see PCP first theyre probably your best bet for pain relief but you do need to see a dentist too to see if anything can be done to sort the problem. Hope it eases up soon ,TMJ,ctl41ap,5,t5_2t0ha

5781186,0,t1_cxdd3r7,You didnt have incisions on the outside skin just in front of your ears then? If not they didnt operate on the joint itself. Getting your teeth lined up better should help chewing and appearance and make it all worth the effort. Please keep us posted when the healing is complete whether the pain you had pre op has been improved by the surgery.  ,TMJ,cxdplqe,1,t5_2t0ha
7050363,0,t1_d1fia66,Sure all is good. I eat what I want generally and pain is very rare maybe once every few months or if I eat steak all week or something but to be honest with you its that rare Ive basically forgotten Ive got TMJ. I do however wear a brace every night and avoid deliberately trying to open my mouth too far so not trying to eat burgers etc...  Opening is about mm which Is only  off normal operating so all things said im pretty chuffed ,TMJ,d1fim4c,1,t5_2t0ha
7382880,0,t1_d2h3ypb,Yeah thats sort of the feeling I get...Im definitely not looking to sink a bunch of money into appliances that may or may not work. I have an appointment with a TMJ specialist in a few weeks so hopefully things will improve by then andor Ill get some answers. Thanks! ,TMJ,d2hdtao,1,t5_2t0ha
7419880,0,t1_d2kpdmm,This is an option of course but Im looking into other options obviously.  So far it sounds like I need to work on clenching my jaw less.,TMJ,d2llbt3,2,t5_2t0ha
7933170,0,t1_d47i37x,Thanks... I did schedule with the major local hospitals TMJ clinic...but they are overbooked into oblivion they cant get me in until late October .  I saw a new guy who I do trust but I fear that he may have prescribed physical therapy without really knowing the true cause of my issues.  There are other reason why I dont think focal dystonia is too far out there the thing that caused the initial tightness was a lot of unilateral gum chewing and the thing that worsened it was hyperextending.  Those are both completely consistent with one of the etiological factors repetitive motion and one of the exacerbating factors injury of FD.  I mean yeah I probably dont have it but I still think its definitely worth looking into if symptoms continue to be this strange.  Also I believe TMD is just a collection of symptoms it doesnt so much cause things to happen.  In a sense FD of the jaw could be its own class of TMDs.  But like my long rant states I want to know whats going on and a simple diagnosis of TMD is not descriptive at all it just says theres something wrong with your jaw.  FD is a neurological disorder that causes spasms.  A completely different thing that also could cause spasms is the ligaments getting very stretched out and the muscles are spasming to hold my jaw in place.  Yet another one could be soft tissue injuries.  Lots of possibilities but I want to know which one Im suffering from. ,TMJ,d47rh8e,1,t5_2t0ha
8021546,0,t3_4p2afk,Consult your friendly dentist saying you have dislocated TMJ. Whatever you do please dont say you have trouble going down on your man. I didnt know what to say last time I heard that. ,TMJ,d4hp42k,2,t5_2t0ha
8110042,0,t1_d4rmimm,Well I have a mouthguard that I currently wear when I go to bed because of my clenching amp grinding in my sleep. If I wore that while weightlifting should I be fine?,TMJ,d4rn42y,1,t5_2t0ha
8218812,0,t3_4rvfot,I had this happen almost a year ago. Best of luck. Mine still has not gone back to normal even with antiinflammatories muscle relaxers and most recently  weeks of targeted TMJ therapy. I think if I had been able to get that therapy sooner I wouldnt be here a year later. Try and find someone who specializes in TMJ if you can since I wasted so much time on regular dentists and doctors. I hope you can get back to normal soon!!,TMJ,d54woac,1,t5_2t0ha
9335633,0,t3_5893mx,The TMJ issue is further complicated by the effects these problems have across all fields of medicine.  The Shimshak study published in Cranio showed a  increase in medical expenses across all fields of medicine.A major problem is insurance coverage insurance companies do not cover well and often due to that treatment is compromised and patients suffer.Cranio.  Jul.Health care utilization by patients with temporomandibular joint disorders.Shimshak DG DeFuria MC.Author informationAbstractThe claims data base of a large New England managed care organization was used to compare the health care utilization patterns of patients with TMJ disorders to nonTMJ subjects. Inpatient outpatient and psychiatric claims data were examined over a wide range of diagnostic categories. Age and sex adjusted results showed that overall patients with TMJ disorders were greater utilizers of health care services and had higher associated costs than nonTMJ subjects. For some of the major diagnostic categories such as nervous respiratory circulatory and digestive the inpatient and outpatient claims differences in utilization and costs were as large as  to . For only one diagnostic category pregnancy and childbirth were utilization and costs greater for nonTMJ subjects than TMJ patients. The psychiatric claims for TMJ patients exhibited differences that were at least twice as large as those for the nonTMJ subjects.,TMJ,d8zcylo,2,t5_2t0ha
9678822,0,t1_da60um6,This is my personal opinion only. I am retired but did practice ENT for  years and saw a tremendous amount of this type symptom. Listen to your doctors there instead of me but if they are stymied you might try some of what Im suggesting as a fallback position. You actually wont find much in the literature on cervical vertigo but the symptoms you described are common accompaniments of TMJ and may well respond to anything that treats tight neck muscles. I often put people on Flexeril and physical therapy for a couple weeks as both reinforcement and treatment of the diagnosis therapeuticdiagnostic trial. Remember that the physical therapist might be inclined to do one Eppley maneuver for BPPV after the next and if that is not productive you might tell them to work on the tight muscles instead.  Not sure any study will nail down the diagnosis of cervical vertigo any better than this trial of treating your tight neck. If there might be some questioning of the diagnosis of cervical vertigo you could ask what they think causes the unsteadiness that goes along with TMJ. To my knowledge studies have failed to nail that down but it happens and IMHO it responds to treating the tight neck. Mild BPPV symptoms can be confused with cervical vertigo but they dont occur along with TMJ stress and tight neck the way cervical vertigo does and just dont seem to be part of the same process.  ,TMJ,da64a1z,1,t5_2t0ha

10684520,0,t3_5sta2g,Honestly I would receive a shitton of craniosacral therapy. It is literally SAVING me. Unfortunately current finances only allow me to go once a week but even that has started to drastically unwind a  year issue more rapidly than I could ever have imagined. If I had all the money in the world Id do it intensively for awhile go  times a week because I think my body could benefit from that ,TMJ,ddi0zuy,2,t5_2t0ha

10805705,0,t3_5ujdir,There are a ton of TMJD specialists who scam people out of their money especially on the west coast in Oregon and Washington. You cannot see the state of cartilage on an xray youd need an MRI for that and if all your cartilage was gone you would need surgery not some weird long involved treatment plan with mouth splints. These doctors get away with these scams because many peoples TMJ issues go away all by themselves without treatment so when people get better its easy for them to claim credit. Did the doctor tell you they cant take your insurance and that you must try to get reimbursed? This is also a strategy that scammy doctors use.You might want to get a second opinion. See a maxiofacial surgeon and get an MRI of your jaw and neck to see what is really going on. The surgeon should be able to tell you the extent of damage and a conservative treatment that will actually work.edit removed a french word,TMJ,dduj6es,3,t5_2t0ha
10910239,0,t1_de53iyt,Okok I see what you mean now ! Having a to narrow of a top maxilla caused one side of bottom to grow inwards while the other side remained mostly at the correct location. This caused my jaw to shift one side causing a functional shift like you called it. If the narrowing of the bottom teeth had been done more symmetrically this wouldnt have been such an issue.Is this making any sense?,TMJ,de5bb5y,1,t5_2t0ha
11141334,0,t1_deuu041,Thank you for the reply. Can you give me more specifics on that technique? I started Oxygen Advantage is it discussed there?

11319423,0,t3_615i4p,Its hard to read this and not feel for the level of  despair you are expressing. Do you have anyone you can see for help in that regard? Often your primary care provider is the best start. There is a time and place for mood elevating medications at least temporarily to break the vicious cycle of pain leading to more pain. Very best wishes to get on a good path up and out. ,TMJ,dff1d8n,1,t5_2t0ha
