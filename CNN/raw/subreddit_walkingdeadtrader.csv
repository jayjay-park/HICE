Yeah it def sucks that you wasted so many credits to turn around and see this sale all of a sudden but like I said in another post...at least their first fix wasnt to shove them in pay bundles....,walkingdeadtrader,d36u22o,1,t5_3ekly

7639439,0,t3_4jxyhd,Considering they messed up the free vote having to spend credits to pull an FC may not be a bad idea. When SWCT first started the FC was  odds and available in the  credit packs. No one complained because the packs were cheaper and the odds were low  was low back in the day.  When SWCT decided to make the FC free during Series  that caused a TON of problems because they didnt anticipate the demand and basically their servers couldnt keep up. People were able to pull multiples of the FC for free and lots of other people that werent at that devices when the FC dropped missed out.    For Topps not to screw this one up any further I guess it needs to be in the  credit pack. Otherwise shame on your Topps.,walkingdeadtrader,d3ak8id,0,t5_3ekly
