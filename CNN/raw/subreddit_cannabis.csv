Unlike crimes they imply no malice toward others and no interference with their persons or property.gtIn vices the very essence of crime  that is the design to injure the person or property of another  is wanting.gtIt is a maxim of the law that there can be no crime without a criminal intent that is without the intent to invade the person or property of another. But no one ever practises a vice with any such criminal intent. He practises his vice for his own happiness solely and not from any malice toward others.gtUnless this clear distinction between vices and crimes be made and recognized by the laws there can be on earth no such thing as individual right liberty or property no such things as the right of one man to the control of his own person and property and the corresponding and coequal rights of another man to the control of his own person and property.gtFor a government to declare a vice to be a crime and to punish it as such is an attempt to falsify the very nature of things.

2626821,0,t1_cmysrwh,Let me preface this by saying Im not a lawyer and this should not be taken as legal advice. Having said that my understanding is that the act of shipping presents much bigger legality issues than simply possession. You are illegally using the United States Postal Service to transport federally illegal drugs across state lines. Therefore this is a federal crime not sure exactly which ones and you are not protected by state laws. I think people get around this by assuming the shipper is taking a risk not the receiver plausible deniability but if you really wanted to know about this stuff id say take a look around rdarknetmarkets.Edit In short I do not think receiving the package is simply possession and would thusly be punishable by more than a  fine violation of federal not NY law.,cannabis,cn1gmm5,1,t5_2qhg2

Low supply and high demand equal high prices high supply and high demand cause lower prices than the former its basic economics. And I cited an example that I see with my very own eyes. When my mom came out to visit last year she wanted to check a dispensary out but couldnt stop going back and forth between wanting to go not wanting to go wanting to get something wanting to just see what it looks like. She eventually decided to after I told her that she should just check it out even if she didnt get something and she did. Just got a little shake joint and that was that. Despite purchasing it legally and being somewhere that she could consume it legally for whatever reason she couldnt bring herself to do it she smoked bud when she was a kid too and ended up giving it to me. So yeah tell me that I dont know what Im talking about but I know of multiple examples where it just hasnt captured the attentioncomfortability of a very large and financially flush demographic. Time dismantles that fear once the facts and reality set in and there will be much more interest. Im not saying that marijuana will become a cornerstone of Colorados economy but itll become a much greater portion than it already become now given those two rudimentary economic and psychological examples.

3068274,0,t1_cofedg3,Yes.  But mainly I dont like surveys that intentionally or unintentionally skew their results by pretending to be surveying the general public but make it impossible to complete the survey unless you are only on one side of an issue.  Basically you will get a result of almost everyone who takes your survey saying Yes I consume it  mainly because the people who would have said No cant answer the rest truthfully. So people who say No basically have to lie pic all the other questions making those questions less accurate for the people they were meant for which might cause you to lose money by mismarketing or the people who say No just dont complete the survey at all making you think  there is a larger audience for your products than there actually is which will cause you to lose money. If you are only interested in the opinions of people who consume you should take out that first question altogether and say This survey is only meant for those who consume.  If you are trying to figure out the percentage of people who might be potential customers you should first make valid choices for all questions for people who do not consume and then distribute the survey in less selfselected subreddits.

10947923,0,t1_de94tva,I wouldnt be too worried. Its too big now. They cant put it back in the box. Its already been proven to be a good system it generates a massive amount of money for the state and it generates a lot of money for the industry itself. Theyre not dealing with guy dealing weed out of their living rooms anymore theyre dealing with billions of dollars in combined political legal and lobbying power. If the state decides not to enforce it the feds cant do much about it because they dont have nearly the resources to fight such a huge industry. It would just cost them way to much to try and enforce it by themselves. ,cannabis,de978km,6,t5_2qhg2

11552103,0,t3_64qoc9,Im fine with them making sure the consequences of the legality are addressed  things like driving stoned and selling or giving to minors and making sure producers are licensed and legitimate.  I just cant stand their regulations regarding how we behave as adults with the drug.  Limiting possesion to  grams?   plants under  inches?  Its legal or its not.  I dont care about the laws now  why do they still insist on holding our hands?  If I want a  sativa in my backyard  then let me do it.  If she yeilds  pounds  I dont want to feel like a criminal.  Its legal or its not.  ,cannabis,dg5fn7y,1,t5_2qhg2
