8772508,0,t3_5093bk,Literature is replete with the concept of naming something to rob it of its power especially demons. Perhaps this would work on a god?There is also the myth that by lack of belief we can kill a spirit. The gods are alive because we believe in them. Could not lack of mortals belief then kill a god?The other idea is god as an impostor who can be killed easily if the truth is known. Think the cargo cults of the south pacific or the Wizard of Oz. Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. Arthur C. Clarke.,creatives,d728a6v,3,t5_2r4e2
