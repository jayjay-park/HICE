7010807,0,t3_4ammfr,Mens sports garner more revenue which means that they have greater resources for generating and gathering information. Analytics is one of the prime investments of those resources. Data and research cost money manpower and time  from the articleThe information shortage is a direct byproduct of the attention shortage of the WNBA and the revenue shortage from the fan shortage of the product. More viewers and more dollars would lead to more analytics as an effect. More analytics in itself cannot cause more viewers and more dollars for the sport. Thats my take anyway.,wnba,d1b0sek,2,t5_2sk8b
