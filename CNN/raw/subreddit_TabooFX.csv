10286556,0,t3_5na2dh,I was watching on Sling which I only have for sports so it was an unusual experience for me as well. At around  minutes my wife said Wow. No commercials yet. Followed  rapid fire commercial breaks later by Well fuck. I jinxed it.Its really hard getting used to commercials when I deal with them so infrequently anymore. I dont even let my  year old watch live tv on sling because she gets upset at the commercials thinking someone changed her show. ,TabooFX,dca1d29,3,t5_3cslm
10332112,1,t1_dcf0edn,No I dont reject that hes a great actor I mean he did well on the st episode but people say that he was amazing thats what triggers me.He could perform a great acting he has that talent its just that even though he hasnt shown that great acting of hisintentionally in this episode people say that he was awesome just because its Tom Hardy.,TabooFX,dcf7aq5,-1,t5_3cslm

10501130,1,t1_dcyaz75,I watched all three but the last  were so dull that I barely cared. I forgot he checkmated the company that if he goes then the island goes to America because Im barely invested in it. Im trying too hard to figure out what his motive is and who or what matters to him. Its not your fault. Its my attention span. I spend a lot of time walking around my house in a top hat claiming Im very dangerous to everyone. Havent had one fight of late. I dont like senseless action. I like some action. And as far as my tastes go Im loving Young Pope. ,TabooFX,dcyex16,0,t5_3cslm

10823159,0,t3_5tii6q,I think they meant it as damnedcursed mind in a healthy body altering the correct latin phrase. Since this was a mental hospital it makes sense. And I really appreciate itPost Scriptum  And also the mispelling of corpore could be explained in this way. This was an asylum. Everyone and everything was supposed to be crazy or if you look in another way the managers wanted to make them think they are mad using nonsense inscriptions!,TabooFX,ddwbzse,3,t5_3cslm

10848490,0,t1_ddywlpb, Dont get me wrong though I enjoy the supernatural elements I study the occult and could probably easily find the exact ritual that allows you to visit other peoples dreams.

10869063,0,t3_5uuo3t,Is it just me or does anyone else find the depiction of his mother ? to be quite hot actually. Judging from the general depiction of women in this series one can quite easily see how syphilis took such a hold in those days.,TabooFX,de12ekq,2,t5_3cslm
10871223,0,t1_de0tn9g,Yep Godfrey for me too. He seems one of the few genuine ones caught up in everything. His loves for James is very sweet in a sad scary world.,TabooFX,de1af4k,15,t5_3cslm
10880656,0,t1_de204r2,I think he didnt want to hurt her and right now he feels like hes not safe to be around. The last time he was with Zilpha he had a vision lost control and tried to strangle her. Now he thinks he may have had another vision and killed Winter. So I dont think he would want anything to happen to Zilpha so he broke it off.,TabooFX,de29gbl,11,t5_3cslm
10891378,0,t1_de3ao56,Another redittor in the last episode thread. She said in an interview Tom Hardy spoke about how he would  be open to do  seasons if people like it a lot. Because he likes content and working with his father and Knight.,TabooFX,de3d9ss,4,t5_3cslm

10966668,0,t1_de92ovx,Thank you. Thank you for this post. As someone whos not a history buff I feel that I miss out on some subtle aspects of the show. Ive been wanting to hear more of a historians take. For a show that takes pains to maintain a sense of historical accuracy its surprising that the finale had these flaws. I was thrilled but ultimately disappointed by the finale as wellbut for different reasons.,TabooFX,deb4uoj,2,t5_3cslm

10994955,0,t1_dee8irx,Yea wasnt implying the he has any supernatural powers. Just a timeline correction seemed to me she jumped after the torture scenes which appear to have happened the days prior when he was brought in.I do think James believesed? he did and that the murder of Thorne was a possible turning point for him in regards to that.,TabooFX,dee8sdh,3,t5_3cslm
10995995,0,t3_5x0tv9,Also wondering about this. The ending was almost exactly what I assumed would happen and it was all a bit anticlimactic afterwards. There was great tension all the way through the season and I felt it all leave when they fired the first shots in the final battle.,TabooFX,deed1u4,6,t5_3cslm

11002714,0,t1_deew9qe,gt Bill and Atticus Delaney one of Helgas whores Delaneys son the Chemist wholl probably live Godfrey and a few members of Atticus crewYes but they are all kind of side characters with kind of a low profile. The Chemist and maybe Atticus are the only two that stand out for me and Id rather have them killed off then the more important characters. I dont really understand why they did this. Maybe those actors werent willing to sign up for more than one season? E.g. why kill Franka Potente but let the other prostitute alive that had zero character development? I cant even remember her name to me she is just random prostitute that is the second witness. gt ultimately to NootkaUSA will add way more charactersI agree they almost have to and they could bring in new good actors. But then again why recast half of the show after one season? Now they will have to develop all those characters first. E.g. Jonathan Pryce was a great villain will the EIC now just be irrelevant or why remove him from the show? If we see the EIC again then they will have to introduce some new character in charge of chasing them. Why not use one of the old ones? Especially if they had Jonathan Pryce.gt Delaney might have logical reasons for flying the flagYeah I thought that too but when they replaced the flag in the very final scene with the music and after him saying that they are Americans now it felt like he meant it. It wasnt oh by the way guys replace the flag because we are pretending to be Americans now. It was more like some revelation. But maybe I am just misinterpreting the scene.,TabooFX,def4jai,4,t5_3cslm
11013712,0,t1_degckyg,Except she imagined the dream.  Because when he asks why she killed her husband she told him he told her to.  He said nothing of the sort unless it was in her dream which he wasnt in.  There is no proof of anything supernatural the show runners made sure of it. ,TabooFX,degdg7i,2,t5_3cslm
