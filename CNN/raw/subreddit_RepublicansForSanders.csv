4370465,0,t1_csgnwvr,gt Ive been watching old YouTube videos of him talk and Ive gone back as  years. What I found is that he has been saying the exact same thing for as far back as I can find evidence for it. That is stunning.

5399955,0,t1_cw1vrqw,Id rather not waste my time here and write a book for you explaining my claims when plenty of them have been written already.  Considering venturing outside of this echo chamber and perhaps youll find them.  Also I didnt claim hes wrong about literally every political idea  I happen to agree with him on several things.  I agree with almost every candidate on several things but that doesnt earn them my vote.  The OP suggests that Bernies honesty is all that matters.  But I am attempting to point out that it is not true honesty at all but telling people what they want to hear.  It just so happens that unlike many other candidates Sanders also happens to believe what hes saying.  But this doesnt make what hes saying any more or less true nor doe it mean he would be an effective President and it certainly doesnt mean he could make good on his promises.,RepublicansForSanders,cw1wjur,-7,t5_3837u
5490562,0,t1_cwcx4o8,Obama has vetoed  bills since he came into office. Three of those were this year. Here is a list of all  of themIn comparison Bush Sr vetoed  bills in his term as President.The Congress needs to get bills to his desk if you want to blame him for your problems.,RepublicansForSanders,cwdgy08,2,t5_3837u
6235411,0,t1_cyydreb,gt Just to question the premise of the argument would there be a particular reason that Walmart stops employing people in this scenario?No particular reason. Just a binary requirement employment of an individual vs. no employment of an individual for the hypothetical situation.gt And then to answer the question yes they would be more reliant on welfare if they became unemployedThe premise of the get WalMart off welfare argument is that working at WalMart is a burden on the system. When in fact working at WalMart or anywhere really  WalMart really is unfairly targeted here when so many other businesses big and small also pay minimum wage relieves burden FROM the system.Yes you cant really live off of a minimum wage job. But thats a separate argument I believe. gt but if they stayed with Walmart and were paid a living wage most of them would not qualify for welfare because they would be paid too much to qualify.True. Minimum wage isnt really something you can live off of. I mean you might be able to pull it off. This depends on budgeting and the cost of living in the area in which you live though among other things. To be able to do so is a rare circumstance. But thats another argument entirely I believe  to get into the purpose of minimum wage whether or not you should try living on it whether or not the situation creates a desire to better yourself and society by gaining a skill or education to overcome your minimum wage situation etc.What I take issue with is targeting WalMart when they arent the only ones out there paying minimum wage.I do admittedly have a bias though. WalMart treated me alright. Not the best. But that was my managers fault not the company as a whole. Still they had the best health insurance plan Ive ever had. That was preObamacare though  IDK what it looks like now.By the way thank you for maintaining civility.,RepublicansForSanders,cyyecst,2,t5_3837u
6366167,0,t1_czd8j72,gtFeel free to remain in the party and try to influence it to take more stances that appeal to you.TBC Im a Democrat I just like rubbernecking around various Bernie subs plus I have a lot of Republican relatives.You raise some interesting points and that video is priceless. Good thing for YouTube. Im not sure I entirely agree that corporations and government need to be set up as counterweights I think all organizations should be controllable and accessible to their constituents. In other words more democratic. I have hope that the Sanders campaign is going to help renormalize the idea of people taking control of the groups they join. I think a common assumption about that is that horizontallyorganized groups will pull themselves apart but I dont think thats any more likely than with hierarchicallystructured groups.Id like to see the GOP become more like the LP and the Democratic Party become more like the Green Party.And yes we all should be keeping closer tabs and asking tougher questions about the corporate bottlenecking of shared information. We need to step up and be the government and the media to the best of our abilities.And now Im rambling too. Happy to have traded rambles with you. And thanks again for that link that was amazing.And if you havent already seen it I highly recommend the movie Manufacturing Consent IDK why I cant goddamn link it to start from the top but oh well. Its easy to back it up from there. Its interesting to think about what has and hasnt changed since it came out.,RepublicansForSanders,czd9hcl,1,t5_3837u

6454756,0,t1_czmuxpt,Agreed although some people will always see what they want to see. I was trying to have a rational discussion with a Trump supporter and he decided to dump a copy pasta of Sanders rebutts even though I never mentioned Sanders which included this gemgt Why has he used the Che Guevara term Venceremos which means We will overcome and why does he always use the famous Communist term revolution?Yes the famous Communist term. Never mind that every July th we celebrate the American Revolution.

6520537,0,t1_cztrgrn,gtI think with a UBI you would have a large portion of the population Im talking VERY roughly around  or so that would not work since they had no incentive. I would expect that number to continually rise over time. Especially if individuals received more for dependents. Thats probably not far from the truth and I dont see a problem with that. Rising unemployment as automation takes over. More and more people free to pursue their personal goals as time goes on. Real freedom not the freedom to choose to work to survive.,RepublicansForSanders,cztrwbu,1,t5_3837u

6652667,0,t3_46rtyx,I am honestly thinking I wont vote if Bernie does not win the nomination. The only Republican candidate I was comfortable with was Rand Paul. I cannot vote for Hillary in good conscience. But I also cant vote for a Republican candidate that I believe will only make things worse. This just makes me want to work harder for Bernie to get the nomination. ,RepublicansForSanders,d07fyye,15,t5_3837u

8584566,0,t1_d6ena1e,This guy Evan McMullin is not progressive but he has said publicly that the Iraq war was a strategic error and that gay marriage is settled law at this point while noting he is opposed to it on a personal moral level. If I were a Republican Id vote for him and not Trump. It seems like one of the downsides of conservatism is a real fear to buck the status quoorthodoxy of your own party on things that were undeniably disastrous like the Iraq war. Maybe thats why the GOP couldnt get it together to stop the guy.,RepublicansForSanders,d6enoon,1,t5_3837u
