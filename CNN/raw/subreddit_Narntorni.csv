9463239,0,t1_d9fgnu8,I may be wrong. It just strikes me as suspicious. If it is cursed maybe we can use that special ooze to break it down into its component parts. Then you could put the  enchantment on a rapier.,Narntorni,d9fj61c,1,t5_3fm54
9657398,0,t1_da3g559,Oh its also worth mentioning that they Blighted plant folk seem to die differently when killed by radiant damage. This may imply that the Blight is something evil and it can be most effectively combated by something that is holy. This is something we should also relay to the Druids and we may want to consult some holy folk...priests or whatever.In any case if we can find the source of the Blight we should keep in mind that it seems to react differently to holyradiant things.Tholan mentioned that Fear Not was holy in origin but it doesnt seem to have much in the way of holy powers at the moment possibly because it is broken.,Narntorni,da3h54l,2,t5_3fm54
9873434,0,t3_5gn1gp,DM uLimondPlayers Arannis Eugeo Grisel Ib Goblin Ragnar and The Hermit. Matthew also joins us at some point per usual.Authors comment If I had to sum up the events of tonight in one word it would be confusing. I think tonights game was really unique interesting and pretty fun but I spent most of the night in a state of uncertainty and confusion. I still dont know if Ive made a terrible mistake or not. Also I definitely missed a bunch of things due to my perpetual state of confusion so I suspect that this will be my most inaccurate summary to date. Definitely correct me if you recall something differently.Botomancy District Part IV Worrisome NegotiationsWe began the day by planting another bean from the Bag of Beans. Grisel volunteered to plant the actual seed andupon doing soa perfect stone replica of Grisel Fear Not and Bulette shield included rose out of the ground. It appears to be a regular statue however it has some means of speaking without actually moving. And it uses this ability to spout insults lies and promotes violence against Grisel. She tries arguing with the statue but it just ignores her and continues.Ib approaches the statue and tries to talk with it but it only tries to convince Ib that Grisel is evil thus should be eliminated. The statue offers the party a reward for killing Grisel but after showing initial interest they discover that the reward is just ridding the world of her evil presence. Grisel puts a signed note on the statue stating the the statue is a liar and we head off to the Blight infected grove.When we arrive at the grove it seems to be relatively unchanged. The bottom is heavily Blighted but top is relatively healthy and there are intermittent groups of plant creatures and hybrids heading to the top along a large winding external staircase. This time we opt for a more subtle approach. Eugeo disguises himself as a plant creature and we all just walk up the tower trying to blend in. We stop at the fourth floor briefly where Eugeo peeks into the doorputting on an excellent performance of appearing to melt through the wall the same way as the plant folk.There isnt anything of particular interest in this room besides another Blue Lady and the same glowing blue tube carrying nutrients or some such to the top floor so we continue heading to the top without causing a disturbance. Before reaching the top we hear a wail from the Blue Lady below but its fairly far away and we dont investigate any further.The fifth and final floor of the multilevel grove consists of a single massive room with a humongous pitcher plant creature at its center. Four large plant vats and four medium sized plant pods evenly and alternately surround the center plant. Of the four vats one is green two are brown and one is black. The center plant occasionally waters the pods and the vats but otherwise seems to either not notice or ignore the party.Given no obvious course of action various party members attempt different experiments Authors note my memory is a bit hazy on some of the details so correct me if Im misremembering Grisel puts plant medicine in one of the brown vats. The plant doesnt seem to like this but nothing happens. Ib pokes the green vat. The plant doesnt like this either but nothing happens. Arannis eats some of the contents of the green vat which he describes as tasting like blood and feeling like it was punching its way down his throat he takes a small amount of bludgeoning damage. Ragnar touches and tries to communicate with? the green vat but nothing seems to happen. Eugeo puts Mercury poison in the black vat. It seems to ball up and stay on the surface. Eugeo attacks the black vat.The vats take a few attacks from the party and we even manage to slice open the green vat so that it loses most of its liquid content but the center plant then unleashes a fire attack that  instantly downs both Arannis and Ragnar. A couple more rounds of combat ensue both Arannis and Ragnar get healed a brown vat gets destroyed a pod gets destroyed the party takes a couple more attacks but we dont see the horrific fire attack again.After Grisel destroys the first pod a Husk grows in its place and attacks her. This attack is unique and disturbing though as it involves tendrils entering Grisels nose and mouth and exploits one of her weaknessespsychic damage. Just before Grisel retaliates however she hears a request to stop. The tendrils have the unexpected side effect of allowing Grisel to communicate with the plants. Prior to this we had utterly failed to communicate with the plant creatures so Grisel ceases her hostility and takes the opportunity to explain that kidnapping people and turning them into plant hybrids against their will is something that we take exception to.Before Grisel gets very far into this telepathic conversation though Arannis willingly jumps into the green vat... which reacts by cutting off one of his arms and grafting on a plant arm which he seems agreeable to...Arannis hadnt said anything up to this point so I think were all pretty shocked and confused by this. Presumably eating some of the green liquid was another method of establishing communication and Arannis had reached some agreement with the plants that he felt he should keep to himself. The party is split on how to react. But some amount of fighting continues while Grisel and Arannis seem to lose their minds for a bit.Authors note At this point I am thoroughly distracted by the negotiation process so I completely lose track of what everyone is doing. Multitasking is not something I do well...Shortly after Arannis seemed to have lost his mind Grisel realizes that she can still speak normally and relays what shes been doing while everyone else continues the fight. Arannis also mentions that hes reached some sort of agreement with the plants but they havent yet ceased their attacks.Negotiation wise there is some back and forth but the one condition Grisel will not budge on is the unwilling conversions. Only willing participants may be converted into hybrids and they can not be robbed of their free will. Initially the plants refuse as this is apparently their only means of breeding but Matthew interjects with an interesting point about folks that have lost limbs for various reasons and have no practical means of regaining them. It is also mentioned that hybridization may be the only way to rid ourselves of the Wererat curse so theres another good reason many on Narntorni might agree to the procedure willingly. During this process hostilities slow and eventually stop.Authors note It only occurs to me now that their breeding is more like Borg assimilation...worrisome. Also I think Eugeo also gained the ability to speak with the plants at some point but I missed how that happened.Grisel gives a final impassioned appealready to resume her attacks if her requirement isnt met. And while Grisel doesnt seem to be that effective I rolled a natural  on her persuasion check...Grisel has a  modifier too... the secret negotiations with Arannis and Eugeo? make more progress. The final offer is that two more of the party willingly accept the hybridization and that we help them destroy the Blight.Three types of hybridization are offered leg arm or skin. Its unclear but it seems like the different kinds of blessings will impart different special powers or abilities. Matthew volunteers his shield arm Eugeo offers his leg and the bargain is struck. If this is truly the only way to rid ourselves of the Wererat curse Grisel will likely volunteer at some point as well but for now all the conditions of the agreement have been met.Ragnar sees this agreement as an abomination and casts a powerful thunder spell on the pitcher plant the Husk Arannis and Grisel. The spell kills the Husk pushes Arannis out of his vat and frees Grisel of the tendrils. But at this point Matthew and Eugeo have already made their sacrifices and Grisel runs up to Ragnar and tries to convince him to give the agreement a chance. Ragnar still seems unsure but agrees to go along with it for now.With that done we start heading back to town...no doubt to a lynch mob for Grisel organized by that damned statue...and we have some plantpeople hybrids with us now. What could go wrong?Authors note Matthew and Eugeo used the brown vats and consequently pick up some of the Blight. Would the plants really have let Eugeo and Matthew use the blighted vats without warning them? I can imagine a reason for it but it seems like a dick move.Experience  per playerOther things Arannis has a plant arm Eugeo has a plant leg and some minor Blight Matthew has a plant arm and some minor BlightGold  gold per person,Narntorni,dauj5mb,2,t5_3fm54
