392483,0,t3_1ykq8x,gtAlso what do you guys think about these cryptos for long term profitability? Quark Anoncoin Worldcoin Vertcoin Nxtcoin Dogecoin Digitalcoin Mintcoin Darkcoin. Quarks network hashrate is fading fast now that the reward per block is worth about .. With almost no economic development and only  txns per hour there is little opportunity for miners to make money with transaction fees.  It may limp along for a few more months but Quark is effectively dead.. Anoncoin is not truly anonymous and will likely be vastly inferior to Zerocoins zero knowledge proofbased provably anonymous coin once its released. Id stay away.. Worldcoin was killed by the Sharmbeck scam. Currently enjoying a bit of a dead cat bounce but its done. There is no compelling reason to use WDC instead of another scrypt coin with a less shady past.. Vertcoin is basically Litecoin with a different proof of work. People with GPU mining rigs love it because of its ASIC resistance. I dont see any reason why nonminers would want to actually use it in commerce instead of Bitcoin or Litecoin but it does have a nascent community and a competent developer.. Nxtcoin from a technical perspective is very interesting but Im not convinced it is currently a good investment. Prices are unlikely to increase in the near term. Long term looks more promising because of NXTs technological advances over Bitcoin.. Dogecoin is currently undervalued compared to Litecoin but its not clear how long it will stay popular. Youd need to carefully monitor the situation if you want to invest in it longterm and be prepared to pull out if it begins to wane. Also the Dogecoin market on exchanges is very very heavily manipulated at the moment. . Digitalcoin meh. CrytoAve the associated currency exchange if it launches successfully may increase DGCs value. Of course people were saying the same thing about Worldcoin and Sharmbeck two months ago.... Mintcoin is Novacoin with a  week instamine. Good luck with that. I see little evidence that the developers actually understand how a proof of stake currency actually works and I greatly dislike the fact that they have represented Sunny Kings original work as their own without giving him credit. . Darkcoin has the same problems as Anoncoin.,CryptoMarkets,cflg3jq,20,t5_2z2wm

422965,0,t1_cfole5u,You would be totally right if miners werent selfish actors. The expansion of the monetary base implies an unrealized decrease in the value of each coin. The one to sell their coins first would have a tendency to reap the biggest reward for their coins and drive the price down for those who sell later. All other things being equal. Even a coin with a bright future will still have the miners questioning if they should sell now in the high inflationary stage and buy back in when its at a bottom. You dont want to be the last one to sell and this provides a motivation to sell. Kind of self fulfilling.,CryptoMarkets,cfolsy4,2,t5_2z2wm

1320227,0,t1_cihuta6,How value is assigned for anything in life is by its utility or usefulness. The more utility or uses the better and thus assigned value accordingly. Cryptocurrencies have the utility of being a medium of exchange. Now we both know this is not about to happen but suppose the government outlawed cryptocurrencies. The value would plummet to zero but not for those that are backed by a tangible product or asset. The value would only drop to the value of that product. Everyone would more than likely redeem their asset backed coins for the product and that would be that. So asset backed is not a bad thing its actually a very good thing. One it adds an extra utility or use for the coin in that in GENERcoins case it can be redeemed for the asset thus it has the intrinsic value of that asset always embedded into its value. In terms of GENERcoin that intrinsic value as determined by todays energy prices is .c USD per GENERcoin. You can purchase that coin and its energy for .c a  discount to its market determined value. Quite simply put thats a good deal. Thats without calculating the intrinsic value of the public good this coin delivers in a solution to green house gas emissions. ,CryptoMarkets,cii5522,1,t5_2z2wm

6282736,0,t3_41ng4h,Most people recommend sticking to Bitcoin as a lot of coins can be pump and dump scams or lose value quickly however I tend to disagree as of late with a few other coins.With the top  or  coins other than Bitcoin Id probably recommend Dash. Dash is a privacyorientated coin its based on the x algorithm and it suits my needs quite well and Im very interested in promoting Dash. So thats my main recommendation. However I also found Peercoin Litecoin and Ether worth trying as well.Im not sure about other coins like Ripple and NXT but theyre interesting maybe someone else should comment on those for me.However choose what suits your needs most. If you like programming and stuff youll probably like EtherEthereum. If you like donating your computing power to BOINC grid computing projects then Gridcoin would suit you. If you like something like Bitcoin but only slightly different and based on scrypt go for Litecoin. If you want a privacyoriented coin with cool features fry Dash. If you want a coin thats like Bitcoin again but more transparent energy efficient fair proofofstake implementation and minting feature try Peercoin.,CryptoMarkets,cz3rynz,1,t5_2z2wm
