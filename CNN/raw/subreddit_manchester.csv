The tram will probably be more expensive will it be quicker enough than the bus though to warrant paying the extra instead?I just have my doubts that we need trams really. I love the buses and dont feel that I need another additional route into town is all.They turn our roads into bumpy potholed messes tear down beautiful old trees some of the few we have left and put up ugly towers and cables everywhere.

Yes a lot of the food is americaninspired TexMex  LLLB burgers  Almost Famous Southern BBQ  Reds and CampG but its good food done well and people like it.

6319103,0,t1_cz7win9,gt Yeah I meant cooking everything at home without eating outBut what did you do before? I mean if you used to buy a bad of frozen chips its probably going to be more expensive than that.USing the Chilli Example I made a  batch of that which will do six meals Yesturday.  The meat lbs of lean beef was quid from the butcher in the arnedale  I bought a couple of peppers chillis onion a few carrots from the fruit amp veg stall across the road for like around quid total I had spare Ill use for other dishes  Then less than quid for a tin of chopped tomatoes amp  tins of kidney beans form AldSo like probably  total  cost of rice buy that in bulk works out to be pennies. I am certain I could get that down further if I bought everything from Aldi but I like buying just the quantities I use less shit to go off in your fridge if you dont end up using it. And it also tastes great to boot.The biggest cost by far is time. It takes about an hour to chop it all up and cook it which is longer than it takes to whack a frozen pizza in the oven or get a burger from the takeaway.EDIT yes under  should be easily doable.,manchester,cz7wui0,1,t5_2qhjj

11061103,0,t1_dejk88d,Being the CEO would certainly bring some stress and lots of responsibility however it also tends to bring perks that the poor people going for this job wont even get a sniff at. Sick pay. Holiday pay. Pension. Company car. Bonuses. Decent pay. Its a poor comparison. One is in a position of decent wealth with support and perks. The other is quickly picked up on social media used and then easily discarded when of no use a short time later or they quit because they arent earning enough shaking a bucket for money on market street or calling people who dont want to talk to them on the phone. Some will get lucky Im sure and make some money but I suspect you have a very high turn over of staff and probably low morale if you carried out a decent exit poll on them as they left. ,manchester,delravg,1,t5_2qhjj

I scrambled to find the lens that had popped out put it back in then went downstairs to try and get the driver to report the assault.I could see the scally just sauntering away up the street and I was getting quite wound up that the driver simply didnt give a shit I realise that I should have called the Police but in the moment I was more surprised than anything and not thinking quite right.What really bugged me though was some arseholes sat on the bottom deck who started whining that I should just shut up as they were going to be late home.
