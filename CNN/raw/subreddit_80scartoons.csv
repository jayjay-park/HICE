The purpose of a liveaction Mask movie would not only be to sell toys for Hasbro who also own the Transformers but also for selling cars for the same brands that Transformers are currently using.  Also theres a possibility of an overlap with G.I. Joe and M.A.S.K. so I dont know if that would be an issue or not somewhere I read that VENOM is basically a wing of Cobra.So its possible but not likely to happen until the Transformers movies are done.  I also think well see another G.I. Joe series reboot after the last two were pretty badly made.,80scartoons,chx6b7c,1,t5_2ubx2
2263189,0,t1_clrepr6,It really is a lot different. I actually prefer the Dutch version even though I grew up with the American theme. It seems more adventureoriented rather than typical for America Saturday morning cartoon theme that makes it seem like a saccharine diversion. I like the running visuals better too.I wonder what else is different in the translations. Thanks for that! ,80scartoons,clrg81n,1,t5_2ubx2
