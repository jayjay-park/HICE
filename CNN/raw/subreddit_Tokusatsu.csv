11139077,0,t1_deukp5z,I gave DenO a little watch and the first two episodes have pretty heavily sold me on it. I may watch a little of W too see which one I want to invest more time into watching first.I actually really want to watch Gokaiger but precisely because it plays so much tribute to other series I figured I may want to watch some of the older shows first so I can appreciate it all a little more. I LOVE the pirate theme though.Ive also been meaning to watch Kabuto. I watched the first episode and it definitely gave off the dark and serious vibe but Ive seen some clips from it before and it definitely looks cool. In fact I think those clips of Kabuto I saw are probably the first time I ever actually saw footage of a Kamen Rider series. Id probably seen still images before but thats probably the first time I saw it in action.,Tokusatsu,deulq4q,1,t5_2rpxs
