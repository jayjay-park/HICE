Only downside is with her being normal and him being albino youll get het for albino but itll never come through since albino is a recsessive gene. But they both look healthy!     Like I said Id keep an eye on her weight is all I have one girl that doesnt eat as much when she has eggs and will drop a bit so I watch her close.

To start with she was really weak and I know this may sound awful we would put the light on and take her hide out for  minutes here and there throughout the day.

5128333,0,t3_3l8mat,First be wary about petsmart or any pet store really not everyone at them is as knowledgeable as the company would like you to believe though that is store to store some stores treat reptiles like crap some are wonderful. But all of them will try to oversell you stuff you dont necessarily need.For heating under tank heaters are usually best since leos go for belly heat when digesting. Lights arent totally necessary if your UTH keeps proper temps and the lighting in your apartment provides a natural daynight cycle.You can definitely switch to mealworms. I think a fair few folk here use it as a staple.Most folk will tell you sand is bad and it runs the risk of impaction. I dont use it myself I use paper towels and would recommend that or tile. But I dont want to get preachy about the sand thing.Definitely get some stuff to climb on it definitely gives them some stimulation and exercise even if they sleep all day. Make sure to at least have a cool hide a warm hide and a moist hide for shedding.All Reptiles is in Scarborough by Kennedy and .

Some times peoples houses get cool in the winter which is when I recommend using extra supplementary heat. When the temp drops so does the appetite and energy level many breeders will do this so come late winterearly spring they can up the temps and get the females to ovulate in response to the season. But they also prep the animals before hand properly so they dont get to thin. So no real reason to ever to it to a pet it can be a bit unhealthy if you do it wrong as well.

At first I thought she may be impacted but after looking up photos online of what impaction looks like i came across some photos of gravid geckos and they seem to match perfectly. She has never been a very good eater she usually only eats  or  crickets and then turns her nose up to anything else. But here lately she will only eat  cricket and then refuses to eat anything for a day or . her stomach is looking bloated and she has a blue spot and what looks like a vein. then obviously the yellowish patches which i assume are the eggs.edit also her substrate is the zoomed ecocarpet. no sand and I havent ever used sand. i never feed her crickets bigger than her head. She is in a terrarium with a larger male. they have been together since they were both babies. So what do you think? also can you please verify that it is a girl?,leopardgeckos,d53zq9v,1,t5_2slot

My whole leopard gecko breed operation consist of two large finished rooms in the basement. Hence why I said blanket statements are best to avoid. I have to use lighting same with the leopard my husband keeps as a pet in our office which is west facing againest the woods and offered vet little light. Also again some people may need t for supplemental heat. Indoor lighting can also never compare to the actual sun on an arid desert so overkill would be hard to accomplish. Hence why I said Yu may want to double check the lighting on your little girl if shes lethargic. ,leopardgeckos,d59psrv,1,t5_2slot

8364356,0,t3_4u3kmn,Thanks everybody    We found her hiding underneath a dresser not far from her terrarium. She was sleeping. We used a backscracher to nudge her out of there. Upon returning to her habitat we immediately fed her a couple crickets and waxworms. She seems comfortable and not too traumatized lol. PhewI am so relieved that we found her so quickly. ,leopardgeckos,d5n3gr5,3,t5_2slot

9268712,0,t1_d8qmzd1,Well to be fair I only have one Leo who I def needed a tank larger than g. But my fat tails are a lot less active and are plenty socializedhealthy so I just figure there must be some lazy Leos out there too. A dog tied up to a dog house is not comparable at all thats more equivalent to a Leo kept in a small bin.,leopardgeckos,d8qvis3,1,t5_2slot
9374762,0,t3_58z0n3,Okay so the hides are all awesome and so is the tank. To answer your questions  No bulb. Use an under the tank heater hooked to a thermostat so the temperature is around  degrees. During the really cold days I throw a dome lamp with a w ceramic heat emitter on the other side of my tank and she seems to love it. You also dont really need the night moon lamp then. The moss is fine. Ive seen people say no because theyll eat it but I havent seen mine eat it at all. Id just keep an eye on your gecko and if he seems to be ingesting a bunch of it then take it out. I dust my bugs with regular calcium everyday d twice a week and the multivitamin once a week. Regular calcium without d should be kept in the tank at all times. I feed mostly mealworms with crickets thrown in every once in awhile. So yes worms can be given as a substitute for crickets. ,leopardgeckos,d94bfua,2,t5_2slot

9618755,0,t3_5cr40e,gt. Ive read a lot about tank setups and a lot of people say dont have any lights at all but some people say its okay to have lights for night time viewing and such. Which is correct? If lights for night time are allowed what kind would I need?Ive never used lights for leos. Theyre completely unnecessary so I wouldnt bother with it. If you did however want one for the eveningnight time I would say get a very low wattage red bulb just so you wouldnt overheat the tank. gt. I know I need a uth and thermostat to control the hot side of the tank and temps need to be within a few degrees of  is that what the temp should constantly be at day and night? Or should I also get a timer to allow lower temps for night time? You could put it on a cycle but I know most people just leave it on  constantly and that seems to work perfectly fine. If you lowered it for nighttime it would simply mimic their natural habitat but I dont really think its needed. gt. Going back to the light question I have a uvb bulb and housing from when I had my beardie leos dont need uvb right? Just a milk lid with pure calcium powder in it? No UVB necessary at all. The light would actually probably bother their eyes. A dish with calcium powder is perfect for them and all you need! gt. I know not to buy from pet stores do you have any recommendations for affordable breeders? I dont need a fancy morph or anything because I dont plan on ever trying to breed them myself Im just looking for a big cutie cI dont have any specific breeders in mind just make sure to do lots of research and Google certain breeders look up reviews and see what other people say. Sometimes Ive been on the verge of buying and then I look up the company and see some horrible reviews so make sure they seem like a good business. Otherwise check out a reptile expo if you have any nearby! This is  the best way to purchase a new reptile!,leopardgeckos,d9ypjrs,3,t5_2slot

10323145,0,t1_dce6701,Hes been tong fed for nearly a year he couldnt walk on his own until about Sept.  because of his MBD so hes not afraid of that at all and knows tongs mean food.It doesnt actually matter which way I pick him up hell climb onto my hand but the minute my hand moves whether the movement is up or just a little finger wiggle he screams at me. DHe likely wasnt handled much by his first neglectful owner that nearly starved him to death and the store staff he was dumped at a pet store didnt handle him much because his bones were so fragile due to his severe MBD.Despite his small size hes not a baby hes over a year old and is likely stunted he just hasnt been handled often at all so is essentially just not really tame right now.,leopardgeckos,dce6oks,2,t5_2slot

10578877,0,t3_5rb5ay,I have several leopard geckos and Ive had them for several years. I even used to cohabitate some of my females. The success of cohabiting females tended to come down to the individual personalities of the animals. Some of my females tended to be more docilesubmissive and some tended to be more aggressivedominant. Submissive females tended to stay away from each othertheyd claim their own part of the enclosure and generally disregard each other. Aggressive females would fight violently. Sometimes it took a couple days before I would notice marks on them from fighting and sometimes they would fight immediately. Raising the females together from hatchlings tended to have more success that introducing adults.I no longer cohabitate adult leopard geckos. Females that were getting along previously would commonly show a change in behavior after reaching sexual maturity. Sometimes their behavior would change for reasons I couldnt determine. I see from your history that one of those geckos is about  months old. This is the age I would start to get nervous. As you know past behavior is not proof of future behavior.I have seen violent attacks between females who had gotten along for months. Fortunately those never caused significant injury. I have seen the damage they can do to one another thoughIve had breeding pairs attack each other immediately upon introduction once requiring an emergency vet visit and stitches.I cant recommend against this cohabitation strongly enough. If you consult experienced reptile keepers you will hear this story reptiles get along just fine until one day they dont. Sometimes its bite marks sometimes its severely torn skin or broken bones. You are making the decision to subject these animals to risk.When I cohabited I thought the same way you do I dont see a problem so Ill just keep an eye out for problems. I was always aware of as you should be the fact that the cohabiting was purely for my own convenience. You dont have to answer these questions but you should ask yourself Why am I keeping them together rather than separating them? If they were stressed would I recognize it? How? Am I prepared to pay an emergency vet bill if they get into a serious fight? Who is the most qualified herp vet in my area?,leopardgeckos,dd74ng6,9,t5_2slot

10717657,0,t1_ddlfuja,Yeah eco earth isnt any good for leopard geckos. Its too humid and its super dusty when its dry as well as being an impaction risk. Paper towels are a much better choice and theyre much easier to clean too,leopardgeckos,ddlg3ii,2,t5_2slot

10753881,0,t1_ddow0jp,Alright I really want a firm answer on this. I researched the hell out of Leopard gecko care before purchasing one. I have heard so many sides to the story about substrates and it seems like a  split between sand is okay and NOOOOOOOI!!!!  The little guy in this picture is Pete and I have had him for about a year. Before that I had  geckos for about  years and had to get rid of them in a move. I ended up using sand with them after seeing the different arguments and never had a single issue at all in that time. I started Pete off on Carpet when he was a baby and moved him to sand after about  months and same deal he hasnt had a single issue. So is it just a certain type of sand that causes impaction? Through my years of gecko experience I havent had any issues but that doesnt mean this little guy is invincible either so it is definitely a concern that is always in the back of my head that I just cannot find a solid answer for. ,leopardgeckos,ddp6j7y,3,t5_2slot
