If I could give any advice bring all the necessities for residence you know you will need for move in. This makes it much easier to move in.After youve chatted with your roommate and seen your room go purchase anything you may need. Who needs  toasters and  plates right?

4927825,0,t3_3i9qve,You need to have the bursary in your first year in order to get it in later years. Since you havent gotten it before you cant have it now. It also means that if you took  classes in French per semester the minimum in first year but then in second year you decided to do  class in French for one semester and  the next you lose the bursary  forever. Unfortunately you arent eligible for the bursary. There are TONS of terms and conditions the one I mentioned above plus it not being available for students whove transferred from other universities as well as it not being available past first year to any students who are from OttawaGatineau not receiving government financial aid.

Even a full range of coffee juices pop milk and smoothies.The overcrowding came about during exam when everyone meal plan and nonmeal plan went in and spent hrs there studying. The school solved this issue by only allowing mealplan holders in during this time which still had people sitting there for hours but freed up more space for those with meal plan who eat there regularly.Really its the first year of this new cafeteria so some snags are bound to happen and get sorted out as they come.,geegees,czfezl6,25,t5_2st6x

6954788,0,t3_4axmjc,Whats up! Welcome to the University of Ottawa dont forget to bring lots of winter wear because the winters are unforgiving here. Where are you from originally? I am a nd year CS student so I know a little bit. Henderson was designed to be a residence with a balance for privacy and social encounters. I stayed in Stanton which is in the middle of the campus and the floor plan was similar. Henderson rooms are all double but you get your own room and you only share the bathroom. In the other residences you share the entire room like this I had a single room and everyone on the floor shared bathrooms male and female each had their own. The residence made for some great memories because I was easily able to meet people to hang out and study. I think Henderson will be the same but its a little more expensive  difference. Python is taught first year first semester and Java is taught first year second semester. My year was the last that was taught Java all the way through first year. I dont know why they changed it but the rumour is that business students who wanted a minor in CS to help with future business endeavours didnt get a good understanding of the concepts and Python is supposed to be an easier entrylevel programming language. In my opinion both are easy as long as you complete your assignments. Joining an LLC will help you meet people. If you consider yourself a little bit of an introvert LLCs will help encourage you to be more social make friends and help each other out on assignments. However as far as I know you have to be part of the Friel residence to take part in one because all  LLCs organized by uOttawa are based there. If you stay in Henderson your shared bathroom will be a bathroom conjoined between two rooms. So its like a bathroom shared between two people with your own room to poop haha. If you stay in a residence like Stanton or Marchand the bathroom would be more akin to a public washroom like this just with a separate area for shower stalls. The meal plan costs havent been posted yet but here is the page for the meal plan options that they currently have. The  Day Meal Plan is the best in my opinion for an international student because its the cheapest per day and you can go to the dining hall at any time  and get as much food as you want. In total it comes to around  with the other plans being cheaper but you cant go every day of the week so youd have to cook in your residence for the days you cant go.Message me if you have any other questions Id be happy to help. And once again welcome to uOttawa!,geegees,d14npnq,1,t5_2st6x

9585022,0,t3_5c4b1c,I took this class  years ago with a professor who doesnt even teach the class anymore at least I think  Chris Boddy. I remember this lab midterm pretty well because i barely passed. Keep in mind however I also barely studied thinking it would be very easy. This is what I rememberStudy all the labs you did up to the midterm understanding every single chemical process and how to draw them all... The test didnt have the exact same chemicalsreactions as what we did in the lab but in general if you understood all the reactions no problem... Do you understand why you added the acid to get something instead of the base? Why you increased the temperature? If you understand WHY you did every step in the labs then you are pretty prepared because that is understanding the theory of OrgoII. On my test there was also a lot of theoretical questions that involved no drawing but were just questions like WHY would this or this happen if we added Xremoved Y. There were chemical reactions that we had to draw too though.  Thats just what I remember though  as I said i took it four years ago when I was working on my BSc and now Im back for BEng degree.,geegees,d9ujskh,3,t5_2st6x
