8395783,0,t3_4ukn9b,I feel like the characters in the epilogue itself say this. During the epilogue they play another DampD campaign and one of the boys said its too short. He asks What about the lost knight? Hop What about the proud princess? El What about the weird flowers in the cave? The egg thing in The Upside DownOr maybe thats a reach....,StrangerThings,d5r0q2o,265,t5_3adlm
8395853,0,t3_4umnak,gtWhat about the proud princess?my best guess for this is Nancy because she is referred to at least twice as Princess by tommy the jerk. i think she most fits the description as proud princess but i dont know what the Question  loose thread what about her? would be. Is that referring to the possible love triangle between steve  nancy  jonathan?Would the Proud Princess be Hopper? hahah i dunno. But he does have a loose thread surrounding whats up with him at the end.i do think that the Lost Knight is El. And the Flowers in the cave i take that as the egg that Hopper spotted in the Upside Down. Ive seen that speculated before on this sub.,StrangerThings,d5r11f9,2,t5_3adlm

8418735,0,t1_d5tvee2,Thanks for the great response  sorry to keep you up! And yeah I understood the concept behind why the lights did what they did but when we got to see the UD from Joyce and Hops perspective there was absolutely nothing that I can remember that inferred that they could eitherA Be aware of the fact that the three teenagers who were occupying the same space on the other side were even there at all  which raises the question of how Will was aware that his mum was in the room and trying to communicate with him early in the show orB That they knew how to manipulate things on the other side from the UD. So working under the assumption that Will somehow was aware that his mum was in the same room as him on the other side how did he know how to make the lights blink in a certain order or to make the lights on the wall painted with letters light up to spell a word. He couldnt see those letters right? And even if he could how could he light those specific lights up or even know that he was able to?Anyway I might be getting a bit pedantic but in my mind the sequence of Joyce and Will communicating was the catalyst for everything afterwards yet there was nothing that I picked up that explained how that all came to pass. In fact the only time we got a good look at the UD in the last episode it seemed to almost work against explaining it.Despite all that I still had a blast and loved the hell out of it so I guess thats a testament to the rest of the show  its able to have such a profound impact on the viewer despite relatively glaring plot points. Haha.,StrangerThings,d5tvvas,3,t5_3adlm

8427389,0,t3_4tns3p,I believe the black space is not the inside of elevens mind. it is the astral plane where only thoughts can access and manifest. and when El is there its like a sided mirror unless she interacts with something they are oblivious. the monster lives in such a close parallel dimension the upside down to our own that everything that happens here eventually effects that dimension. houses power lines etc. are pretty much proof of this.the reason I dont believe that El and the monster are the same is that she hears it long before she sees it. and the next time she see it it looks like its feeding on something. so unless she created the Russian and the guy reading off random words there is no evidence that she is able to create anything in the astral plane.the reason that the monster can exist in the upside down is to use a quote from a much smarter man than I Life uhhhhh finds a way. the monster doesnt have eyes nose or ears from what we can see. which means that it must use different senses than us. these senses seem to allow it to perceive our dimension but not interact with it. it only gains the ability to pierce our dimension after El creates the rift.maybe the monster is like the leprechaun in the show days. it has always existed just outside our space and time. being an interdimensional creature it has the natural ability to survive in multiple environments. it also has a natural affinity to travel between dimensions. until El fractured our dimensional fabric the monster was not strong enough to burrow into our dimension.,StrangerThings,d5uyr0x,2,t5_3adlm

8617353,0,t3_4xv0oq,My theory would be...After blasting open the portal El was returned to her room while the scientists began studying it. There she rested up a bit and then when the monster came through she took advantage of the chaos to escape  the usual way not through the Upside Down.She can open any door she wants as well as throw guys around with her mind. And with everyone distracted by the Demogorgon chasing scientists it cant have been hard for her to sneak out of the building and then find the storm drain that leads to the woods near Bennys diner.I do think that when she disintegrated the Demogorgon and herself at the end she didnt close the original portal in the lab wall. That Demogorgon is dead but there may be others the egg and theres also the weird slug things. Im guessing the scientists are poking around over there like mad and will probably attract the attention of something else nasty for season .I think shes actually existing on the side of the tightrope in that space we saw in her visions with the black wet floor. She knows now how to travel along it and open smaller temporary portals. From there she can go anywhere and perhaps pop into many different dimensions  though it makes sense that shes sticking around ours  and maybe keeping an eye on everyone and also exploring.Probably the scientists have caught sight of her occasionally or maybe they even have another test subject who can do similar things  track her or sense her. Anywho Hopper is now connected to the lab and thats how he knows shes still around and he set up that box for her. That definitely did not seem like the first time hed left food in there and it wasnt full of rotten stuff.,StrangerThings,d6irnqz,9,t5_3adlm

8774381,1,t3_50a07z,I think the monster isnt El entirely but probably it was a part of her. There are various explanations on YouTube proving that the monster was the manifestation of Els powerful mind. I can only say a few things.. The gate to the upside down opened only when El tried to communicate withtouch it. That can mean that she either literally entered a whole new different dimension or just accessed the deepest and most secluded part of a humans mind and manifesting it in the physical world.. During the finale when El was face to face with the monster she held her arm toward the monster and the monster did the same. When she destroyed the monster El disappeared as well. It can only mean that their existence is paralleled.So yeah hopefully our questions get answered when the following seasons are out.,StrangerThings,d72gq98,-1,t5_3adlm

The day Barb didnt come home from schoolWednesdayher parents are in the Wheeler living room talking to Nancy and her mom about Barb. The next morning the cops are looking for Barb and her car near Steves house. Two cops. That same day Jonathan is looking at caskets to bury his dead little brother. Know why he stopped? To help Nancy find Barb. The next dayFridaythose two cops turn up at Hoppers trailer. He puts a gun in their face. Know what they tell him? The Staties found Barbs car at the bus station. Thats because the secret organization took the time to move her car to make it look like she ran away. Those two cops werent going to let a revolver in their face keep them from bringing up Barb. A few hours after that Steve stops by Nancys house. Know why? To ask about Barb. Saturday when Joyce is talking to Eleven about being able to reach Will and sharing a very touching moment where Eleven is not a monster but maybe a savior know why they stopped talking? Barb. They stopped talking because Nancy asked Eleven to find Barb. Mr. Clarkes date was interrupted to tell the kids how to build a sensory deprivation bath. The kids want to find Will. Know the first thing Eleven did once she got in that kiddie pool everyone worked hard to make into a sensory deprivation bath for finding Will? She went looking for Barb. Remember the end with Will in the hospital bed? His best friends finally can see him and theyre all so excited to tell him about this awesome girl with superpowers they met. Know why the scene ends and we dont know what else they were saying? Barb. Nancy is sad because Barb.Whats uncanny is that everyone in every episode put Will to the side to talk about Barb and people just bleat about how nobody cared.,StrangerThings,d74t1xk,17,t5_3adlm

You caught an awkward piece here.I dont know why it was altered this way. Sometimes dialog is structured the way it is because the director likes the cadence. Even though it may not be critical to the story they do it because it just sounds better to them.I cant imagine why they looped this one in so obviously though.

9632641,0,t1_d9zqt41,Weak cookiecutter villains is Marvels bread and butter.  Their stories require complicated origins that involve mysticaltechnicalfictional exposition to articulate.  At the same time you need to give them a human element so the audience can identify with them.  Either a redemption story lostunrequited love be it of a romantic or familial variety or a revenge arc.  After all that setup is said and done you have maybe  minutes left for your action set pieces and your villain setup and reveal.  Even Marvels good villains Loki mostly still suck in their first appearance.  Loki wasnt amazing in the first Thor movie...It took until the Avengers where they didnt need  hour to explain the heroes to actually give a little bit of time to the development of the villain.  The one place where this is markedly different is in the Netflix series.   episodes gives ample time to slowburn a compelling story of both the heros origin AND the villains arc.  Kingpin Kilgrave Punisher Cottonmouth and Diamondback even if I wasnt a huge fan of Diamondback... all have personality and motivation that you as the audience can identify with.  Personalizing them while also demonizing them gives a greater reward for the audience when they are eventually defeated at the hands of the hero.

Recognizing publication bias as an issue the Parapsychological Association hashad an official policy since  against the selective reporting of positive results. Of the original ganzfeld studies reported in Section  of my paper less than half were significant and it is a matter of record that there are many nonsignificant studiesand failed replications published in all areas of psi research.

You can accuse any study you dont agree with of falsifying data.gtand accepting random chance as hits. Under the null hypothesis since the target is randomly selected from the four possibilities presented the probability of a direct hit is . regardless of who does the judging. Thus the observed anomalous effects cannot be explained by assuming there was an overoptimistic judge.The results are far above the random chance regularly in excess of billions to one.

10648736,0,t1_dde9tty,The town known as Silent Hill kind of exists in a few parallel realms. One is the version on the map thats basically just Centralia PA except its canonically in Maine... run down abandoned town. Another is the fogfilled world where monsters roam and humans dont You dont typically get to leave here... roads crumble into bottomless pits at the city limits etc. Then you get The Otherside where things get worse and youve got an UpsideDown style world full of ash sometimes rusty chainlink fencing replacing bits of the scenery and the real monsters come out to play.The town also tends to customtailor itself to the subconscious of the person experiencing it. e.g. one character whos extremely suicidally depressed after a childhood of abuse but sees her father in several of the monsters in the town instead of them just being monsters. Likewise the main character in Silent Hill  sees oversexualized nurse monsters as punishment for lusting after the nursing staff during his wifes hospitalization.

10704102,0,t3_5t4cwg,All theory about Hopper makes sense... I have my own theory regarding the upside down... You have been warned as well.Theory The upside down is the future of the earth... not an alternate dimension.When Hopper and Joyce go back into the upside down in the last episode.. you see that the whole Hawkins town is in ruins amp looks like its been taken over by the Demogorgon type spices. Hopper and Joyce are walking through the future of the town and they come across all the buildings the library Joyce Byers house the castle byers. All these buildings look like they have abandoned and decaying for several years without any human maintenance... Sorta like the video game the last of us which the Duffer brothers have said was a huge influence of the series where trees are overgrown and fungus is everywhere.This is only explanation for why everything in the upside down is exactly the same as the real world. It is because the upside down IS the real world.. this is what the world looks in the future!! think of this like the original Planet of the Apes.. the movie makes it seem like the astronauts went to a new planet where everything is upside down Apes are rulers and humans are animals.. however it is revealed at the end that they were at earth all along. They realize that earth has been taken over by Apes in the future. Similarly the demogorgan type spices will take over the earth in the future. Season  plot will probably show how this will come about where more and more alien spices invade and take over the earth.So what Eleven has opened is the gate to the future... a glimpse into what future of the earth looks like where humans are extinct and the whole has been taken over by evil spices. The professor in episode  also talks about how they need to put a tear in the space time continuum in order to get to the upside down.. Space time continuum is one the big concepts in all time travel movies. The gate is sorta like a wormhole into the future.The real question now is is this huge paradox? The reason the alien spices took over the earth in the future is because Eleven opened the gateway in the past in  Hawkins.Rewatch the whole last episode with this concept in mind... the whole episode is shot as if they are in the future.. there are several other minor clues in the way scenes are shot. Its almost like the Matrix. The real world is in decay and taken over by A.I..,StrangerThings,ddk1ra8,2,t5_3adlm

11347463,0,t3_61x2zd,Love war justice oppression revenge power and selfdiscovery covers just about everything doesnt it?Your main obstacle is going to be boiling all those ideas down to a manageable thesis. Heres my idea Just focus on Hopper. All those themes are reflected in one way or another in his story and journey. Your best bet episodewise for all those themes is the finale Episode . Hopper essentially goes to war against the oppression of Hawkins lab and the power of the Upside Down to save Will as a means of exacting justice and revenge for the loss of his daughter whom he clearly loved.spoiler A paragraph on each of those ideas wrap it up with a discussion of how the convergence of those themes set up Hoppers character growth and selfdiscovery over the course of the season and youve got yourself a final paper.,StrangerThings,dfi7qbe,12,t5_3adlm
11354980,0,t3_607o1w,Im a little late to the party but I always assumed that the upside down was a black world as when you see  first seeing the demogorgan shes surrounded by darkness.

11697037,0,t1_dglverq,This is getting no where. Im not a lawyer but I honestly dont think the artist has a case because his picture is just imitating the xmen cover down to the same comic book number in the corner. The LC shirt on the other hand appears to be more of a homage to the XMEN cover because its the same basic concept but its not the same down tot he details like the artist did. If anything I would say the artist is in violation of copying the xmen cover while the shirt is similar but not a rip off. ,StrangerThings,dglvls9,2,t5_3adlm
