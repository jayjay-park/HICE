However the only license that will work if you use CC BYNCSA is CC BYNCSA.So I will ask the question again. Are they complying with the SA portion of the license?,creativecommons,cow3dc9,1,t5_2rg6u
6904225,0,t3_4aaf7f,Yup for the purposes of CC syncing music to video is always considered an adaptation.That said theres nothing to stop you from separately licensing the music to people. Just tell them they have your permission and ask them to give you credit.If its important to you that the CC BYSA license be in the credits then you could have them include it but then also include used with permission or something similar. Ive seen that before.,creativecommons,d0ywvwa,1,t5_2rg6u
