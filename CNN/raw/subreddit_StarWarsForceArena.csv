10350202,0,t1_dch3vdg,ujellyfishprince You could play on an emulator KO Player Nox Memu should all work but that wont take away the delay at all. I prefer my phone to an emulator but Ive tried both.uamsage yes this happens quite frequently. I believe the problem is the connection and how actions are queued on the server. I have no idea how the servers work or where they are located but I queue against Kybers who are all around the world so there is always going to be lagdelays. Lets say you are positioning yourself so you press on the screen to move forward an inch. A little bit later you press to attack a unit but the server hasnt finished processing the movement press so it queues both of them together and the server reads the incoming actions as a double tap quick press and your character takes off like a bat out of hell rushing towards the enemy. This is only an assumption but its the only explanation I can come up with for why it happens.Ive read some suggestions for changing the movement to a long press rather than a single press to prevent the game from mixing up attack order with movement order. I think this might have its own set of issues though.Eventually you will kind of get a grasp on how the delay feels and slow your play down to compensate.j Its almost counterintuitive to PC games since you typically want a faster APM on most PC games and in this game you almost want a slower APM to allow the server to correctly interpret your input. That being said even after nearly  games I still have times when I rage because my leader doesnt respond how I want it to.,StarWarsForceArena,dch97fh,1,t5_3hlsc

10388595,0,t1_dclkyaq,I appreciate that you are not and wasnt saying you were just saying I have played with Rambos in v and its not fun to watch lol being Gung Ho.I think the s per death is actually quite punitive. The longer you are out of the field the more time the enemy has uninhibited to drop units and clear lanes. I think early on that run up and suicide bombing a turret strategy works only because the enemy is not efficiently using their deck. The moment you meet one who doesnt drop their deck on a fly and patiently waits for you to drop cards they can counter you will notice that each s more is really giving the enemy a leg up. Really high value units i.e. ATST benefits from the time you are outand from the moment you are dead if the enemy is ready to drop that puppy close to your zone... good luck ,StarWarsForceArena,dclm1uw,1,t5_3hlsc

10660765,0,t1_ddfk441,Id add that there is not a single card behind a pay wall. Not sure thats a first in most if not all app games Ive seen. Yes.. there arent as many legendary yet but the fact that you have potential access to every card is a clear plus to me. Therefore the spending discussion evolves only around the leveling which as weve seen there are people at lvl  with FP decks within  positions of the world wide lead. Thats exceptional. In Clash of Clan this would have never been possible. No FP player did ever come in the first  especially the more updates higher lvl towns were implemented. In this game.. I see the potential that player will come closer together but lets not forget that someone can spend all the money they want in this game and still not be on top as they have to actually grind as every other player. I do like VIP systems which are permanent.What would be great if you could by playing a lot earn yourself the premium boost and or faster opening of Victory packs.

Trust me i didnt believe the others and theres others who said same thing. I figure if there was a way to cheat it be all over the internet. Im thinking it was a bug with energy level or minimap it has only happened once but the amount of troops that were spawned at once without x energy were impossible. My minimap had zero green dots right after i killed opponent and before i spawned my next unit approx  secs leader was back with  energy spawned. I did actually try to get a pic i have Samsung Galaxy and to screenshot i have to hold home and lock screen button precisely same time which i tried but accidentally locked screen when i got back into game i did take pic but it shows a bunch of units on screen i cant prove they all came at once. And so everyone knows this isnt me crying cause i lost i lose all the time my rating is pathetic to my level cause i play with all characters except Luke played him only handful times in beginning of game sure i can play my bossk and win majority of the time but that be boring. Im simply reporting what happened to me and in retrospect more likely bug then a cheat i wrote this post right after loosing badly and after reading another post about cheating so at that time was a little heated.,StarWarsForceArena,ddfp2cx,1,t5_3hlsc

11257542,0,t3_60eq6s,Update last night tried different deck based upon your feedback. Deck was tarkin  storm trooper  blades  rocket trooper  tie  stun dioxin and sand trooper . Oh how the little rebels squealed. I was able to repel the swarm onslaught and counterpush hard. ATST would sit dead in my hand as I would never have enough energy to play it after countering a swarm rush. RT with its lower cost made it much easier to play. It also helped me deal with tanks when blades werent available. Sand trooper was a good addition to clear out swarm. Not having net did make it harder to clump them together for my special but I had enough aoe to never really have to use it defensively. I found I was using special more for tower destruction. I think is my unique was level  I could swap out storm troopers but at level  hes too weak. I love his stun a lot.I had a  win rate vs. Lukes. I think my win rate was  overall. Thanks again for the help. I did find that my second account with a level  Tarkin and level  commons just cant handle the level  heroes and level  commons.

11288937,0,t3_613tbe,The best thing you can do is play cards that carry more risk but play them well. What I mean is play something like heavy gunners which can easily clean up higher levels but you have to play them well in order to not get screwed by energy loss. Remember that most of the time if your turret is even stacked by anything it will mostlikely fall due to it being underleveled so you need to take the shots or have a unit to take those shots.The only other thing is to capitalize twice as much on leader deaths and be extremely aggressive as soon as or just before you get a kill. This is the time they cannot do anything to stop you and you can win games by tilting them or just by the general snowbally nature of the game. Use the increased range of unit placement to your advantage if you trade a tower and do not try to race them. ,StarWarsForceArena,dfbl2a1,1,t5_3hlsc

Any swarm unit is wiped out instantly and any group of units is countered by maybe a tenth of all cards in the game. I also think Vader is better now than ever due to the abundance of Cassians so he counters them amazingly and therefore gets played more. Side note a friend of mine just started this he said Vader was useless before playing him or looking at his stats or abilities. Just found it funny.,StarWarsForceArena,dgqtapg,-6,t5_3hlsc
