I recommend taping your knees with some sort of kinesio tape. That really helps minimize or avoid any knee pains after the class. Another option is a knee brace but I find a knee brace limits my movement in class.,zumba,cgdgejp,2,t5_2spd6

It can be done but spins are difficult with the wrong kind of shoe so I suggest leaving out spins for your dancers since not everyone is gonna have the same shoe. ,zumba,df04kyx,1,t5_2spd6
