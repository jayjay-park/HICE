8059965,0,t3_4pfygf,Hi there!When you say the friend section do you mean the section where you can see your friends i.e. all the users youve friended on one screen?  or do you mean the Add someone screen where youre browsing through users one at a time?Going to assume youre talking about the Add someone screenThe Wusoup algo will usually try show you users that are online right now or that have been active recently. It weighs a lot of factors though and tends to emphasize user quality and the overall likelihood that the particular user will reply to a quality message from you.Part of the point of writing Wusoup was in trying to get beyond the simplistic kind of matching that tends to be done elsewhere or that you could do yourself. Wusoup has tons of statistical info on the behaviour of each user that goes far beyond stuff like last active x days ago.For example lets say we have Alice and Bob.  Alice was last online  weeks ago Bob was last online yesterday. Which user should the Wusoup algorithm prioritise for you when browsing?Answer is it depends entirely on Alice Bob and you. Alice may have great messagereply statistics for other users like you. Bob may be active every day but never replies to anyone. Or perhaps Alice has already friended you and just not sent a message yet she was planning to later whereas Bob already saw and skipped you indicating a certain lack of interest on his part.The Wusoup algo looks at a bunch of stuff like this when sorting users for you. Its not a generic sort your sort order and my sort order are likely very different. Theyre calculated in real time each time you hit the Next user button.Hypothetical situation if we had two users that were entirely identical except for their last activity date the user with more recent activity would always win.In the common case nonidentical users theres a lot more at play that could be summed up as users are sorted by the probability that youd like them multiplied by the probability that theyd respond to a quality message from you.tldr Trust the algorithm  Its not perfect but its already pretty good.But to be clear questions like this are very welcome. If the algos doing something that looks weird its either because it knows something you might not or its because its being stupid and needs to be fixed Reports of weird behaviour are helpful since I can dig and check for unexpected bugs or edge cases etc.Does all that make sense  seem reasonable?Cheers!
