558832,0,t1_cg3sm26,Yeah Ive hardly played relative to some other Mashers and so could really only do these two maps. Each map has ABC points and both spawn points which people will know. Then Red is all thats really needed to start with. Just try to keep them logical and short.,MashE,cg3so0a,1,t5_30mga

1876795,0,t1_cke8xdp,Adding my two cents. I use a controller when I play on PC. If you have your sensitivity set to INSANE you dont get the benefit of aim assist. There are rarely any times I feel that I am at a disadvantage when using the controller. Especially when Im playing with the Mashe Community. The whole controller vs KB debate is kinda of pointless in this game. This game is just way to fast paced with too much crap going on. As long as you know how to take advantage of the map know how to parkour and have competent team members youll do well with either one. ,MashE,ckfchyo,3,t5_30mga

2331915,0,t3_2lzwy2,Space Pirates and Zombies!Got this is a Humble Indie Bundle a long while back didnt touch it. After a few months I decided to fire up some games I have and hadnt played before and that was the first one. Needless to say  hours later I was hooked. Its got a bit of Rogue like elements plus top down zelda like adventure and space combat and throws them together with a crazy batshit awesome story that makes little sense but is hilarious in a lot of places and creepy in others.If you need more of an idea of what this game is about and plays like heres a bit of a review over  hour from the Kerbal Space Program god Scott Manley! Also the introduction is narrated by Total Biscuit so thats awesome too.So far I have  hours played and havent beaten it. Its got a pretty good learning curve and is difficult in a lot of places depending on your tech and ships.,MashE,clzxryc,2,t5_30mga
2334959,0,t3_2lzwy2,Young Money Millionaire High Roller Tier    PAYDAY   Great mechanics exquisit netcode formidable setting and top graphics.  Sugarysweet community and a peach of a developer.  Must buy if you wanna feel like a badass preferably with  friends.   SPLINTER CELL BLACKLIST  Ignore the singleplayer  but grab a friend and be amazed by the fun to have with the coop.  Then after youve familiarized yourself with the controls  jump in the competitive multiplayer  and play one of the most unique amp satisfying modes in a multiplayer game.  Pleasure garanteed be it on the spies or mercs side.    Sure I can let go of this tennerTier    GHOST RECON ADVANCED WARFIGHTER   For me the best combination between difficult realism and action packed fun.  Especially if coop is your cup of tea you will enjoy the heck out of this.  A lot of custom maps and missions can be found on the interwebs  and via GameRanger there are still active lobbies daily!   TOWERFALL ASCENSION  Best couch multiplayer game to date period.  Simple straight forward and mindbogglingly effective in delivering the fun!  Caveat requires a couple of controllers to play ideally.    Less than a Big Mac Meal Tier    JUST CAUSE   I dont care if you play the plain vanilla singleplayer  or the grotesk and tumultuous multiplayer mod  as long as you just experience it at least once!  This trumps most if not all other open world freeroam games  in the just messing around enjoying myself and the tools I gotdepartment.   GMOD  Not a Steamsale goes by or this drops .  It has games within the game.  And there are even games within those games. Value!  Its quirky just like most people playing it.  You can sink hours and hours in this nifty piece of software  one of the best bangs for your buck!   PORTAL  Im a sucker for coop but I would pick Portal  over Portal  any day.  The cake is a lie jokes aside this is one of the best narative  experiences out there combined with amusing mechanics.  The short length of it doesnt make it any less valuable.  Still play it at least once every year.   ORION DINO HORDE  Sure you can argue watching a  coin being flushed thought the toilet  is a more enjoyable way to waste the money.  But you would miss out on watching dinosaurs glitch out  admiring the sassy hipswing of your spacemarine  fumble in a way that doesnt correspond  in any way to the inputs that you gave etc...  Please note that you should not partake on this endeavour solo  buddy up with one or more friends  and you will see the real beauty.  ,MashE,cm0balv,3,t5_30mga
