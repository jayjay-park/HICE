477203,0,t3_1z7qg4,Pattern seems more intelligent and helpful than he was before and possibly even more than Syl has been so far. Syl seemed to push Kaladin in the right direction talking out his issues with him helping him cope with his hangups. But even in danger  we have never seen Syl take such an active role in protecting Kaladin. Where here Pattern keeps making suggesting about what to do and then helps her to soulcast properly when she decided to go that route. I assume that when she gets to shadesmar that Pattern is the reason there is a floor instead of her drowning in the black spheres... I also appreciate that she recognized him as Pattern almost immediately. Also we never got to see Jasnah communicate with the spheres to soulcast. The spheres this time actually speak back to Shallan through Pattern and I loved that the ship didnt want to change because it was proud of being a ship. You immediately get the sense that the ship thinks like a spren at least in shadesmar. Who knows if this is how it is done normally or if it is particular to Shallan or if it is a result of Patterns direct involvement. ,StormlightReadalong,cfuiedg,1,t5_309gy
