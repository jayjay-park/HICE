9596864,0,t1_d9vurvt,Simbas graphic design wife here I agree with my husband. Honestly I would say the two things that stood out to me were the font and the harshness of the graphics in front compared to the background. The font is kinda plain while my husband is the game buff Ive never played this game in my life but can only assume from context its a space game? I would use something a tad morw bold and blocky and make sure you shadow it makes all the difference. The colors in the graphic compared to the background are a bit more bold. If youre going to bold route stay bold throughout. If youre sticking with faded and vintage stick with that. Honestly it takes me sometimes  versions of something to make a final copy. I usually change the background remove the background. And one final tip sometimes simpler is better.  Otherwise keep it up the fact you asked other people to help sharpen your craft says a lot. Some people are so stuck  ahem me that they refuse to hear what other peoples opinions good or bad on their piece. I did a quick graphic for my SIL wedding something or other and I attempted  different things before I ended up going back to my original graphic. My husband told me they rocked but its my husband he thinks everything I do rocks  ,TheLastFederation,d9w0csk,4,t5_2yvqx
