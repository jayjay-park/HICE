9326,0,t3_1u8cca,In  the first BorelCantelli lemma where one has a convergent series independence isnt needed. In that case you can define the events En to be a success on the k consecutive trials n n...nk. You should be able to get a condition for convergence and hence happiness.For the second BorelCantelli lemma you do need independence between the events En in which case you could use your definition of En to be success on the trials kn kn... knk. There is independence between these events though your concern that youre not counting all possibilities isnt really needed. Note that the event you are interested limsup of the Eis as defined in the first paragraph is a superset of the limsup of the Eis as currently defined. Thus when you find a condition for series divergence you can use the monotonicity of the probability measure to find a sufficient condition for happiness. ,cheatatmathhomework,cefhwvo,2,t5_2rbfw

One of the equivalence classes is nn  n  .  Ill leave it up to you to prove that this is an equivalence class.If you denote the equivalence class of ab by ab you can define two new operations on the set of all equivalence classes thus    a b  c d  a  c b  d    a b  c d  ac  bd ad  bcYou might notice that    a b     a   b    a b    a b  b a  a  b b  a       a b     a  b a  b  abSo suddenly the set of all equivalence classes  looks a lot like the integers .

Since ax  exlna  you now gety  t  etln.So product rule.  Derivative of the first times the second plus the first times the derivative of the second.  Derivative of the first part is just .  Derivative of the second part needs the chain rule and you get ln.etln.  ln..t .So dydt  .t  tln..t  .t    ln.  .At least I think thats it.  And wolframalpha.com confirms it in a slightly different form.  Now the trick is that never reaches zero.  And in fact because dydt is always positive  gt ln. it keeps going up.

You could conceptually compute pe by repeated multiplication then divide by n with remainder to get c but thats hopeless inefficient. Instead you can use exponentiation by squaring to reduce the number of multiplications to loge and you can divide by n with remainder after each multiplication which keeps the intermediate values smaller. Keeping the intermediates less then n saves space and multiplying smaller numbers is faster.Decrypting is symmetric pcd mod n except uses a different exponent d. ,cheatatmathhomework,cjovw06,1,t5_2rbfw

You can even compare this to the line that would be generated by this strategy i.e. use this technique on the line y  ax  b then use calculus to find the optimal a and b to minimize the error.Finally you can compare this new line with the line you found to see how close you are to a best fit curve. However this isnt the only method for calculating best fit curves as the way you found your own line may be different. Your approximation and error estimates depends on your assumptions.

2913300,0,t1_cnz8mv8,I think I can identify  errors for you.The denominator of GY is probably missing a cube on the giant parenthetical expression ie. the part that isnt Y. With this correction I was able to simplify the nd derivative to the given answer.And in going from the first line to the second line of the second derivative you cancelled out Y from the numerator but Y from the denominator. In general you can recognize this error in using the quotient rule for higher order derivatives because the denominators exponent should generally increase by  with each successive derivative. So the original has the denominator to the st power the st derivative has it to the nd power and the nd derivative should have it to the rd power which yours doesnt.There was also the unnecessary step when you multiplied out the denominator at the end of finding the first derivative. Not wrong just never used again.EDIT I take it this is graduate economics.

2981767,0,t1_co705um,The fact that cbcbaa does not imply that cb  a and cb  a. However you may carry out your deductions as follows.If a b c are all prime. Then all of them are integers. Further they are either  or they are odd.we will start with the case where all are gt  and therefore all odd.An odd plus an odd is an even.Ad odd minus an odd is an even.Therefore  cb and cb are both even. An even times an even is an even. Therefore a must be even. But a is odd. and an odd times an odd is an odd. Therefore a is odd. Ergo our assumptions must be wrong as they led us deductively to a false conclusion. The assumptions we made were that abc are prime and none are . We have now cut the problem down for all situations where none are . We proceed with the cases where at least one of them is .Cauchy schwartz inequality gives us that c gt a  band c gt a  b for non zero a and b.Therefore we may restrict our space to situations where at most a and b are . If this is the case c  sqrt which is not in P.We now have just one case remaining. Either but not both a and b are . Let a  . If b and prime and c and prime  c  bThis takes a bit more work but you can show there is only one solution b a c by using variational tactics. Aka let d be a prime that is deltaB and c be a prime that is deltaC the minimum delta size is  and you will never have two positive deltas such that we satisfy.c    deltaC  deltaCb    deltaB  deltaBc  b    deltaC  deltaC  deltaB  deltaB.attempt to minimize that for all integers gt you can relax this to the reals to use calculus techniques. And you will show that this is always greater than . Therefore no remaining prime integral solutions exist.There is only one solution ,cheatatmathhomework,co71jfp,0,t5_2rbfw

CSPs are the subject of intense research in both artificial intelligence and operations research since the regularity in their formulation provides a common basis to analyze and solve problems of many unrelated families. CSPs often exhibit high complexity requiring a combination of heuristics and combinatorial search methods to be solved in a reasonable time.

You usually want to bound it above by some multiple of |xc| or really any positive power of it that does not depend on x. Fun tricks include |x| lt |c|  |xc| and liberal other uses of the triangle inequality. Work out what this means for d if |fx  a| lt M|xc| for some M then d lt em gives your result. Its slightly less straightforward when the expression is something like sqrt|xc|  |xc| but generally some massive overestimation will still suffice e.g. |xc| lt mine should work there.Example from the bookWell skip straight to |fx  a|  |x  c|   |xc||xc|  lt |xc||c|  |xc| Using |x| lt |c|  |xc|  lt d  |c|d as |xc| lt d Weve reduced this to showing that for any e gt  there exists a d gt  such that d  |c|d lt e. Then the trick is just to find some example In this case d  mine|c|   works.For the sqrtx one as upicado says you can note xc  sqrtx  sqrtcsqrtxsqrtc|  so |fx  a|  |sqrtx  sqrtc|  |xc||sqrtx  sqrtc| lt |xc|sqrtc and then the choice of d should be obvious.Tldr Write down the thing you want to be small bound it above by something really weak in terms of |xc| and then find some delta small enough that this is also small.I hope this made sense and helps you in some way.,cheatatmathhomework,cpr85ce,1,t5_2rbfw

In the natural numbers case note that both are the same up to a shift in your index of summation    sumninfty fracn  sumninfty fracnI think you could get away with calling either series harmonic even if it differed from the standard definition by a few terms.But if you mean that x is to be considered as a real variable then we could set up any number of different power series or Laurent series representations of that function.

If you make those three things equal to t then for example you have t    yand you have two other equations x  some function of t and z  some other function of t.Now for any value you assign to t you get values x y z that are on the line. Varying your value of t will move x y and z and give other points on the line. You have paramterised the line using t. The line given passes through a point x y z where all three of the original terms and t are equal to . If you work that out you will see that you can in fact read those values out of the original equations. If you work out from your formulae what dxdt dydt and dzdt are the amount x y and z change if you change t by  you will see that those numbers too can be read off from the original equations. These numbers need to be kept on your new line to keep it parallel to the original line.So you can put  in where the positions of x y z were in the original equations being careful with minus signs and keep the rate of change values the same and you have the equations of the new parallel line.,cheatatmathhomework,crghmud,2,t5_2rbfw

4526145,0,t3_3d0zpa,Without compression the best you will be able to do is to put it as its binary representation with one bit per bit.With compression you need to decide whether  how much error you are willing to tolerate. If you absolutely need lossless compression then you will have to accept the fact that you are merely moving entropy about the input space. That is to say for some numbers the encoding will actually be larger than the input while for others it is much smaller. Huffman coding is a quick example of this. So if you accept that then you should order your numbers by frequency somehow or introduce auxiliary information such as a dictionary. Such examples are RLE LZMA and my personal favorite Statistical LZwhich essentially does a statistical analysis of the data up front decides on an encoding scheme and then provides that auxiliary information along side the data. If memory is expensive and CPU time is cheap this is probably a good option.As a general engineering guideline when you find yourself having questions of how do I get X to occur by doing  using Y? It is often better to ask the question I am trying to accomplish W. I have thought to use Y to get X but am having difficulty is this the right approach? That will generally warrant you far more useful answers from the internet  instructors  etc.So in that vain what is it exactly you are doing? If you can explain the use case we may be able to assist you better.Edit if you are just doing this one number a Huffman tree should be sufficient.,cheatatmathhomework,ct15pmj,2,t5_2rbfw

What speed must it average on the return journey so the overall average speed is kmhr?By your argument youd simply have to solve   vfor v which would yield v kmh.But upon reflection it should be clear this isnt quite right because the method isnt correct. See in order for the twiceaslong roundtrip to be twice as fast as the first leg youd have to make the return trip instantaneously. That is youd have to be going infinitely fast on your second leg for this to happen and thats impossible. Itd be even worse if you picked something greater than  kmh then youd have to travel fast enough to move backwards in time!Sometimes you can simply average quantities directly.

5247664,0,t3_3mvmdj,a We want to know when the ball hits the ground. We know the ball is s  tt feet off the ground at time t. The ground is  feet off the ground so we need to find the times when   t  t  s  .b  st  st   t  t will give you the average velocity of the ball between times t and t. An example to make this clearer Suppose the ball is at rest on the ground and teleports  foot into the air after  second where it remains floating. Then letting t   and t   the formula  st  st   t  t gives . This cannot be the instantaneous velocity at t since at this time the ball is not moving.To calculate the instantaneous velocity recall that velocity is the rate of change of displacement with respect to time so you need to calculate dsdt.c There are two ways you can calculate this. The first the more calculusy way is to observe that when the ball reaches its highest point it will have stopped moving if it were still moving upwards then it would be about to go higher and if it were already moving downwards itd already be below its highest point. If youve done b youll have an equation for velocity. When is velocity zero?The other is to observe that   t  t describes a parabola.

5972304,0,t1_cy2h498,It comes with practice. When you first encounter it there is little reason for you to think of that step naturally. That is why most books on writing proofs include multiple examples of this sort.Having said that. I will try to give a better explanation. On the right hand side of the original inequality you have n  n. We assume that is true  for some value k gt. We then want to show it is true for  k. That is we want to show that it is true for  k  k. If we expand this we get k  k    k. Now to get k on the left hand side we must multiply both sides by . So on the right hand side we get k  k    k  k.  We have to get this into a form that looks something like the expanded equation I mentioned above. Breaking it down in steps we can do the followingSplit up like termsk  k  k  k kk  k. factor out a two in the first part  k k  k  k kThis looks similar to what we want to show. So then set up inequalities based on k gt .All of this stuff is done by playing around until you get. The final proof is nice and smooth but the process of getting there takes a lot of background work like what I did above.,cheatatmathhomework,cy2i0gb,1,t5_2rbfw

Anyway here goesOn the first day we have    possible permutations of pizza slices. However some of those are the same in a different order e.g pepperonimushroom mushroompepperoni so really the number of combinations of slices is          times   sodas   possible combinations of  slices  a soda.The easiest way to think about each day after the first for me is to imagine that the cafeteria offers a huge menu of  possible lunches all the combinations of  slices and  soda. On the first day Bob can choose any of those  possible lunches. However on each day after that hell only have access to  of those because hell have been eating one of them the day before one that he cant choose again. So basically each day after the first you get  possible lunches and the total number of combinations of possible lunches over a  day period is   .Added The reason for          is that  of those possible slice combinations the ones that are the same kind are going to be unique but    of them where were picking  different objects from the same set are going to be counted twice once in each possible ordering ABBA for each combination hence why we divide by .,cheatatmathhomework,d17bdqe,2,t5_2rbfw

A more efficient way you can come up with recursion for the number of ways to roll k with n diceckn  sumi.. ckinAnd you could evaluate that with dynamic programming building up a table of ckn for n   .. . Or slightly more efficiently you can view that as a convolution operation which is associative and use exponentiating by squaring. You can also see that idea as the more general recursioncknn  sumjn..n cjnckjnAnd use that to compute the table rows for n           . Heres a page that mentions some other ways. Or another way for the  value   with  dice you could use starsandbars to count how many ways.

I suspect its the one above because this does simplify to x   but written the way it was in the question made things somewhat unclear. Did you mean x  xx   or x  xx   for example. The first would be written     x  fracxx   and the second as     fracx  xx which are obviously different.From the above though. There is an x bracket on the top and bottom of the fraction so you can cancel these away. You can write x   as x   since two times three is six or just x    x  . You can also write x  x as xx  x using the same sort of logic so x  x  xx   . So there is also an x bracket on the top and bottom of the fraction so these cancel away too.

The cross product just tells you if the vectors are collinear and it doesnt require the vectors to have the same starting pointthe new vector that comes out can go anywhere it wants.The problem is it doesnt really help in the case you gave because if we shift the vertical ray to the left a bit itll miss the other ray but the cross products of each vector wont change.

9214782,0,t3_56kdej,Well for the third one with the roots and intercepts here are the steps Id take Quadratic equation. So its ax  bx  c for some real numbers a b and c. Horizontal intercepts or roots are where the function equals  for the given x where the parabola crosses the xaxis. If you have simple integer roots like that then you figure the equation can be factored into axhxk where h and k are the roots. Because if xh or xk you end up with the equation equalling  times something  . So if the roots are  and  the equation is axx  axx. Multiply that out so it looks like ax  somethingx  something. The first something will be b and the second something will be c. Now if the parabola passes through the point   it means that when x   ax  bx  c  . Well when x   that means the equation is     c  .

Plug that back into either equation to get the equilibrium quantity.Most people are taught graphically to find CS and PS. I assume you were taught to graph P on the yaxis and Q on the xaxis because economics is a stupid discipline that refuses to graph correctly but we Im operating on that assumption Basically if you draw a line from the equilibrium price across you will see you have two triangles. The triangle on top is CS the triangle on bottom is the PS. You can solve for them by just taking the area of the triangles. Arithmetically that means you need to take the price of the demand curve at a quantity of price  and subtract the equilibrium price. Multiply that by the equilibrium quantity and divide by . For the PS you take the equilibrium price and subtract the quantity supplied at a price of . The multiply by equilibrium quantity and divide by .If you have any problems Ill solve it by hand.

9538633,0,t3_5bif0d,You already have a good sketch for a solution elsewhere in comments where you use general properties of subspaces. Let me suggest another method that might be more in the spirit of what your teacher has in mind.You wrotegtMy teacher says we should show that it is part of the null space but I am not sure how to do that exactly.I can imagine there are two basic ideas your teacher might want you to use. If T  V  W is a linear map between two real vector spaces then the kernel of T also called the nullspace of T denoted kerT is a subspace of V. By definition for a linear T between two such vector spaces kerT   v in V  Tv   in W .. If V is a vector space and U W are vector subspaces of V then UW   v in V  v in U AND v in W  is also a vector subspace of V.Lets say you have these two theoretical tools. If you dont then try proving them or at least try finding a proof in your notes andor text. Your original subset of R is X   xyz in R  xy AND yz .Im giving it the name X just to save myself some typing later on.From context this should look like the intersection of two kernelsnullspaces. Concretely consider the map T  R  R Txyz  xyyzThen if you have  above and you can show that T is a linear map between real vector spaces youd have that kerT is a vector subspace of R. Further by the definition of X X  kerT.Therefore since X is the kernelnullspace of a linear map its thus itself a vector subspace of R.Alternatively you can consider two maps S  R  R Sxyz  xy S  R  R Sxyz  yz.Now using if you show that S and S are both linear maps then youd have that X  kerS  kerSso X is the intersection of two kernelsnullspaces in which case X is itself a vector subspace of R.This methodnamely recognizing that a given subset can be viewed as the kernel of a linear mapcan be a very efficient way to prove that a given subset is a subspace of a particular vector space. So I hope you see not only how this works for this problem but also how you might be able to apply this technique to show that other subsets are vector subspaces too. Good luck!,cheatatmathhomework,d9ou2oq,1,t5_2rbfw

Heres one geometric way of thinking about why this is true.Lets start with an arbitrary unit vector a. This vector a because it has unit length must lie on the unit circle. Let a  cos t sin t  lt t lt . Then to form an orthonormal basis we need another unit vector b that is rotated  from a. Then since b also lies on the unit circle we haveb  cost sint.If you remember your trig identities this simplifies to b  sin t cos t.

9694066,0,t3_5dx38j,Studying a lot is not effective if you have no idea what youre doing.  I hope this doesnt sound harsh but based on this thread and your earlier ones you are very very lost about how multiple integrals work not to mention integration in general.This is not really a problem we can fix easily by explaining how to do a few integrals.  You kind of have to start from the ground up.  Read a bunch of examples.  Actually pay attention to what they are doing.  Showing us correctly worked examples that you dont understand and asking us why is it like this? is going to be way more effective than showing us your mistakes and asking us why is this wrong?  Usually the answer to why is this wrong? is basically because its not right so the better question to ask is why is whats right right?You have a very common problem among poorlyperforming calc  students which is that you arent thinking about these integrals at all.  Setting up the integral in calc  was always easy.  Some simple formula and you integrate over whatever interval.  Now you actually have to understand what you are doing.  What the region looks like and how you can describe it in multiple ways.  How the variables interact and what they actually mean.x goes from pi to pi?  Does that make any sense?  What do x y and z mean in Cartesian coordinates?  What do rho phi and theta mean?  What D region is being described by the limits of the given spherical integral?  Without truly understanding this you stand almost no chance of completing it correctly.  The graph of ycos x which you have drawn twice for some reason has no relationship to any of this.Based on your other posts before you dig too deep into trying to understand cylindrical and spherical spend a lot more time on just understanding D integrals in Cartesian.  For instance this one  You described the region just fine but in order to know that your chosen order is not going to work you have to realize that you cant integrate cosy with respect to y.  Youre forgetting the chain rule.  Not just forgetting to do it but forgetting that its a thing that exists which renders your integral impossible.  You have to do that integral in x first.With some help you got it switched over to this but then right away you not only made the same mistake but also totally forgot that the integral you were supposed to be doing first is with respect to x.  You substituted yy and apparently didnt even stop to consider if doing that makes any sense.  What meaning does y have if we can just do a step like that?This isnt going to be easy and asking us for help on specific integrals is kind of missing the point.  You really arent getting the big picture so no amount of asking what did I do wrong on this one is going to get you where you need to be.  You have a lot of work to do and theres only so much help we can realistically provide in a setting like this.  Good luck.,cheatatmathhomework,da7zzm1,3,t5_2rbfw

To find breaking even just find where the function is positive. In this case after finding roots and testing it is if X lies between . and .. So thats when you will break even.. After finding first derivative of the function for maximaminima point you get x. On second derivation as a test for maximaminima you will get ve value meaning it is maxima. So profit will be maximum at x.Additional proofGo to this website demos and type out the profit function mentioned above. And check the graph. The x axis being variable x is our number of products the y axis being profit is our profit  p x . Clearly the yaxis values ie profits are positive between x  approx . and .. So this interval is where we break even ve profits . And click on the top most ve value of the graph and you will get x y. Meaning the profit peaks at x with a profit of ..Reasoning  you break even when you make some profit meaning at least  profit. So checking for ve values in the function gives us that answer.Now at all maxima and minima the rate of change is . Because the values are peaked and adjacent values are also same so the rate of change around maximum value is . And st derivative denotes rate of change. So the functions st derivative equated to  gives the x value where there is  rate of change ie maximum profit.A nd derivative acts as a test. It means what is the rate of change of rate of change. It is negetive it means the values are going down from this point which means we reached a maximum. And vice versa for minimum. Youll get ve vakue on nd derivative of the function. So x is indeed maximum value.,cheatatmathhomework,deqwf2v,1,t5_2rbfw

11248530,0,t3_60jvd6,Think of the weighted scores as a whole pie with different flavors or weights. It has  exam in it and  coursework. We can find an overall class score by finding what percent of each type of flavorweight we actually earned and when we put all the remaining parts of each flavor together we get an overall score.The problem states the student scored only  of the possible portion of coursework or  of  of the total grade which when we multiply it out gives us ... aka .So if we want a  total grade and we know the student already has  of that total we only need  more of our total which will come from our exam flavor of our pie. We just think this out like before except now we dont know the score on the exam we need to get the  of the possible  of our whole pie. Therefore we can say X is our exam score and write the equationX..We get X ..  . or ..Therefore with a known grade of  in coursework the student must achieve a minimum of . on their exam to earn a total grade .Edit I mixed up . and . in the last part.,cheatatmathhomework,df705xl,1,t5_2rbfw

11359466,0,t1_dfjcmoo, the mean and median are both closer to the minimum which means that there is a greater concentration of data points on the left side of the distribution most likely. Therefore we can say that there is a skew to one direction. Which one? there are C ways to choose  white sheep and C ways to pick  black sheep. Out of the  sheep there are C ways to pick  sheep. So therefore the probability of getting  white sheep is CCC the probability of grabbing k white sheep is CkCkC. The expected value is the sum from k to k of kCkCkC. So just add the numbers together to get your answer,cheatatmathhomework,dfjkp58,1,t5_2rbfw

11536504,0,t1_dg3mulf,gtI thought the number of functions was YX between a function mapping elements from set X to set Y? Do you mean that f X gt Y has YX maps and sizeOfX  sizeOfY elements?My bad rookie mistake on my part its been a long day. Youre right the number of functions from X to Y is |Y||X|  or using your notation sizeOfYsizeOfX . gtThe size of A here is  element and the size of X is  in the example solution. How are these two sets isomorphic is the size of A isnt the size of X? Are you looking at all the possible maps of A to X and saying those possible mappings are isomorphic to the number of elements in X?A set of  elements and a set of  element are not isomorphic but thats not what were saying. Youre confusing X and HomAX are isomorphic with X and A are isomorphic. Meaning the number elements in X is the same as the number of maps from A to X.gtHow do you get |A|   from |X|  |HomAX|  |A| |X| ?I assume |A| |X| means sizeOfAsizeOfX?if you divide by |X| then you get |A|  |HomAX| no? how do you get |A| here? Also what if X has zero elements? If |A| then what would the element from A map to in X?Accounting for my earlier mistake wed have the equality |X|  |HomAX|  |X||A| . Comparing exponents on the outer two expressions |A|  .If X is the empty set then there is exactly one function mapping from A to X the empty function.gtSo in the example of Ax and Xthen there are  possible mappings between AgtX and HomAX x x x  and this equals the size of X which is . So |HomAX|  |X| and hence isomorphic?Yes.,cheatatmathhomework,dg3ny6i,1,t5_2rbfw
