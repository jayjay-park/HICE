3145906,0,t3_2w6t1v,Story time I saw this at a bar the other day. One hip guy in new brand name clothing decided to mock an older guy who was wearing older brand name clothing. The older guy gets up and starts using some rather colorful language. I have edited his comments to avoid the bad words and racist triggers. What kind of guy comes into a club and starts criticizing another guy because of the cloths he is wearing? You shouldnt even be looking at me. Im an old guy. You are a young guy. Instead of looking at me and criticizing me for my clothing you should be paying attention to the ladies here and their clothing. Where are your priorities?,YourBrainLiesToYou,coo2iwd,1,t5_34868
