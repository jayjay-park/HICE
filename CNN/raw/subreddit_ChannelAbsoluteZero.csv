8390689,0,t3_4uke4a,For a bit of help for the level you can do a midair spring jump and its fairly simple.  Just let go as you begin to hit climax in jump with practice should feel natural.For the hole you jump down just drop the spring and ground pound once you begin to fall of the screen.  Hitting the spring you must be able to do a full jump and then go into the next area.For the wall jump with spikes surrounding the top you must wall jump and then ground pound almost instantly might help And yes you must go under the bricks with the propeller suit.  Marios toe is made of steal dont worry.Everything else should be explanatory if not follow the arrows.Enjoy those kaizo blocks!  ,ChannelAbsoluteZero,d5qdtp4,1,t5_3fiti
