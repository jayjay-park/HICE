12646,0,t3_1u9n5l,Heh Im glad I wrote this yesterday so I can just keep copy pasting it when this question comes up. If there are any bits that dont specifically pertain thats why. I think itll answer your question though.As others have already mentioned the Remington  and the Mossberg  are the best options on the market. Theyre cheap Mossberg is cheaper versatile extremely reliable and can be configured to do anything. Both the Mossberg and the Remington have barrels that can be swapped for longershorter ones to best fit your needs.FOR HOME DEFENSE  barrels are the Federal legal minimum on shotguns but many manufacturers will only make them down to .. The ATF has a short ruler. For this purpose you want the shortest overall length possible so the weapon isnt unwieldy. NOT SO YOU CAN CLEAR ROOMS. The best option in home defense is to barricade and wait while the police are en route. The weapon must. Have. A buttstock. Whether its collapsible traditional thumbhole or recoil reducing doesnt matter. Pistol grip only shotguns may be fun range toys but for a shotgun protecting you and yours it needs a stock for recoil absorption and control. Larger magazines are better. Mossberg has a slight edge here over Remington since they offer  instead of  but you want a magazine that extends the full length of the weapon. Itll cost a little more but its worth it. Have a plan for ammunition. If you have to fire you need to be consciously aware of how many rounds youve expended and have a plan to plus up that magazine from whatever system youve devised. Whether its a side saddle velcro shell cards or some fancy system where shells are stored in the stock you want to be making sure that you have some sort of plan in place. If you buy a Mossberg DO NOT PUT A PISTOL GRIP ON IT. It completely defeats the ambidextrous and easily accessible nature of a tang safety and makes deactivating it quickly difficult.FOR HUNTING Mossberg receivers are made of aluminum in contrast with Remingtons steel. This can be advantageous both due to weight and corrosion resistance. I can personally attest to the weakness of the parkerized finish on new production s. If you already like the Mossberg its just one less thing to worry about. A long barrel with interchangeable chokes lets you have maximum control over the spread of your pellets. This is advantageous because hunting different types of game at different distances requires different spreads. An  improved cylinder wont take full advantage of the velocity potential in a  GA shell and doesnt allow you to add tighter chokes to reach out a bit farther.FOR TARGET PRACTICE There isnt really anything required here. Unless youre getting into skeet or competitive shooting you just need a weapon youre comfortable with and can enjoy. Make sure the length of pull is right for you and anybody who may be shooting the gun often.Other than that youre just going to have to choose between a constantly downed carrier like the Remingtons or a carrier that goes up and out of the way like the Mossbergs. Ive owned and shot both and have a preference for the Remington because it can keep dirt and debris out of the tub and action during field situations. The Mossberg is IMO marginally faster to load because the carrier isnt in the way. Its really just personal preference between the two.,guns,cefvh9o,7,t5_2qhc8

It really does look like a slide bite though because of the parallel cuts space evenly apart. If his beavertail is really causing that type of injury he may want to wear gloves or keep his skin moisturized well. Ive had chaffing from a stippled grip before due to dry skin so I actually lotion up once in the morning and night. Granted it never looked like that just ashy skin. The moisturizer definitely helps.In order to maintain proper recoil control though your hand is supposed to be high up against the beaver tail but not pressing hard into it as to force it to indent into your webbing. Just firmly. The only other way I could see him getting slide biten is if he is limp wristing causing the gun to recoil back too far and the slide pushing onto his hand. But it doesnt look far back enough for that.,guns,cei1q0s,1,t5_2qhc8

39768,0,t1_ceiwtl2,Yes it is absolutely down to culture and possibly the idea what many firearms only serve one purpose other than providing a tool for a hobby.  I never heard the car analogy before  thanks for that insight.I think there is the view abroad that guns equals concealed carry which is further exacerbated by the public shootings which is pretty much the only gunrelated news we get in the UK.  I believe the US view is if a situation happens then if you have a gun you will be more equipped to defend yourself as a last resort as opposed to if a situation happens then if you have a gun there is immediately a gun in the situation.  Completely down to culture.My brother has an interesting argument that says if everyone has the opportunity to carry a concealed weapon and right to use it petty crime goes down and people are more polite.  As a fan of small government I like this argument  concealed carry essentially gives ordinary citizens the right to police other citizens which I think is far better than the state having that entire right a trend sadly increasing in the UK.,guns,ceiyigc,1,t5_2qhc8

159840,0,t3_1vx6uj,The Glock  while outwardly similar to other Glock designs contains some internal features that are markedly different.In fact there are at most  minor components Ive identified that are readily swappable with other Glocks The front sight Spring Cups maybe Striker Spring maybe Magazine release spring maybe The trigger itself may be swappable but typically comes assembled with the trigger bar which is not compatibleMost curiously The rear sight is narrower than stock and may be lower than stock based on sight markings two bars lower one is shorter. In regular Glocks the markings indicate a .mm height versus a standard mm height of .mm The safety plunger is an entirely new design does not rotate is not symmetrical and has a single orientation.  The slide release doesnt use a flat spring its a coil spring under the release and isnt readily removed with the standard Glock disassembly tool The cruciform assembly isnt bound by the trigger spring to the ejector block The ejector block is an entirely new design that draws some elements from the NYx springs while also introducing a very different and somewhat intricate mechanism. I havent cracked how to disassemble it yet. The disconnector is a different design and is quite thin. No easy LWD . disconnector jobs here. Holster compatibility is out the door. Not even my Raven Vanguard II has hope of workingI think in some part this gun represents Glocks realization that a single stack subcompact embodies a tabula rasa scenario where nearly zero parts compatibility allows them to reexamine their ecosystem and historical design changes free of the constraints of backwardscompatibility. What theyve created is in many ways more simple streamlined and easier to manufacture. Internals changes in the G may well be ported to legacy platforms in the future. I strongly suspect the safety plunger and ejector block designs may be seeing a change in the Gen guns. I havent shot the gun yet but so far the package and envelope makes a ton of sense and this will be taking over for my G as my EDC CCW pending reliability testing a new holster and some tritium sights.Last thought I cant discern any reason why this couldnt have been modified modestly and sold as a mm.Edit Thanks internet stranger!!,guns,cewn0g8,21,t5_2qhc8

175163,0,t1_ceyc8a5,If the factories were charging more and selling the same amount they would make more money. Money can be invested in capital like new machines to produce more ammo. This increases supply while lowering cost per round to manufacture. They can then continue to sell at higher prices until demand is reduced making more and more profit to invest in more and more capital. At some point supply matches demand prices lower which they have room to do because prices were inflated and by then the factory has some shiny new machines ammo is cheaper than ever and everyone has as much as they want.

That is how VA is setup for the law. I dont think this is how it should be. There is no VA castle doctrine that I know of and have always found that basically if someone breaks in you are to try to leave the dwelling before using deadly force. Although with that said I personally will do whatever it takes to protect myself my home and my family. If someone breaks into my home while I am there they stand a very good chance of getting put down. How am I supposed to know if that person is going to try and hurt me or my family? I dont. Nor will I take that risk.  ,guns,cf1c8gb,1,t5_2qhc8

There is not yet a permit required for long arms in New York State. If they are assault weapons they will need to be registered under the sons name see  for whether or not the gun needs registration. Assault weapons CAN still be transferred to immediate family which includes children.Hand guns If its an assault weapon and the son doesnt have a concealed carry you cant carry out your plan. See above for link on whether or not it is an assault weapon. They cant be transferred back in to New York State once they have left. Beyond that I do not know the exact laws on transferring a pistol to ones children after the parent has died. There may be a way to deal with it legally but Im not aware of such matters.

293645,0,t1_cfb6wwo,This has all been addressed many many times here and elsewhere but to summarise Your HD gun needs to be accessible to you and ready to shoot without fumbling about. Yes you need to prevent unauthorised access. However removing the ammunition does NOT make it safe for children or anyone at least not children who have ever watched a movie or played a video game and thus know how to load a gun and is thus completely pointless. For people who have lots of visitors or children it is generally recommended to get a quick access safe or lockbox. And put the gun in there LOADED. Most people might do that but its still stupid. They risk end up getting shot in that case. The right thing to do is to stay where you are get your kids if applicable with your gun pointed at the door ready to fire. Clearing a house that has potentially armed criminals of an unknown number in it is freaking dangerous enough when a trained SWAT team does it with flashbangs and body armour and all. There have been many first hand posts by exsoldiers on here about this. For a single sleepy homeowner with a Glock its downright suicidal. The sound gives away where you are that you noticed something is up that you are armed and what you are armed with. Maybe itll work. Or maybe the gangsters have been looking for you and will now sneak up on you and shoot you in the back. Maybe you WILL scare them except instead of running away maybe they start firing at the sound and maybe you will then die. If self defence with a FA is necessary you dont mock around you have to shoot to kill. Messing around here with noise and warning shots and shit can even hurt you from a legal point of view in the aftermath.,guns,cfb79ka,3,t5_2qhc8

This particular copy is odd because while it is a DASA gun it has no decocker. Instead it has a manual ambidextrous safety.

This subreddit sometimes seems like its full of nothing but George Zimmermantypes who cant wait for an excuse to draw on someone and save the day. OP just like he said get away and inform the police. You have no legal obligation to do a damn thing but youll have a ton of liability if you fuck it up and shoot an innocent person you dont know all of the facts to make an informed decision if youre just an observer. Morally speaking though in my opinion the only time I think you should intervene  assuming you are capable of doing so  is if someone is literally being threatened with their life.  If its just an assault or breaking into someones housecar leave it the hell alone and let the cops do their job.

332051,0,t3_1xvtou,Ima do you a favour just cause its FridaygtOK. This is mainly a post for the folks that were wondering how my taurus story ended up. gtOur journey begins  years ago on a sunny day in south Texas a young man buying his first new handgun. Having not read any reviews and only going on the recommendation of a few friends and family he I chose a taurus pt. It fit my purpose perfectly and I was stupid happy to have a shiny new handgun I could afford. gtMy next day off I headed to the range. The new gun jammed literally every other shot  shots with no jamming was a small victory. I understand that things can go wrong so I call taurus and after sitting on hold for about an hour I explain the problem to them. Im told that it is likely a magazine problem with both mags and that they will send me  new mags free of charge score!. gtSo the months drift by and I call them again. Where are my new mags? I ask. The angry sounding woman on the other line tells me that they are backordered and that I should expect to wait a few more months however as compensation for the error they would add another rnd mag free of charge. Im getting tired of waiting but what can you do so I ask for another rnd mag and the mag sleeves to be included and they agree that this is ok. gtMore months float by and I receive a package from Taurus.  extra rnd mag and  more rnd mags.  mags? Hell ya. So off to the range I go. gtA happy day until I experience the same problem with every single magazine. At this point Im pretty tired of messing with Taurus so I let a month or  go by before contacting Taurus again. gtUpon contacting them this time they tell me that because Ive had the gun for more than a year I am now responsible for  for them to send me a shipping label to send the gun into them to cover shippingprocessing. I let them know that this issue has existing since purchasing the firearm. They said it would still be the  so I chewed their ass pretty good until they agreed that they should waive the . gtSo back to Taurus my gun goes. They had it for about  weeks. . months. I get my gun back Im fairly happy at this point. FINALLY a working hand gun. gtSo I joined my parents at the range but my gun still had the exact same problems. Shoot jam clear shoot jam clear shoot repeat essentially a pump action .. gtOK so Im pretty well sick of calling Taurus at this point but anger makes for a decent fuel so this time I tore into the rep pretty good until they put me in contact with one of their supervisors. After ripping into him pretty good he agreed to overnight my gun back to them and said they would likely replace it with an upgrade. I followed the tracking and when it got to them I called and left a request for them to process it now instead of the usual  weeks. They pulled it and had it repaired and ready to ship back within a couple hours. gtI told the guy I didnt trust it because even if they did fix it i wouldnt trust it as a carry gun anyways too many issues so far. He assured me that they had fixed it and he had personally put about  rounds through it to test it. They could hold it for evaluation or mail it back so pretty much Were sending your gun back to you now. Do you want it now or do you want to wait a week?. So of course I had them mail it back overnight. gtWhen I got it back the slide and operation of the gun were much smoother. I was hopeful that they had fixed it but not holding my breath. I hit the range again. Predictably it misfired like shitty clockwork. This time I did a few things differently. I took pictures and video. This time when I called the taurus supervisor back during the conversation I linked him the pictures. gtHe said send it back and they would evaluate it for replacement. so I told him to check the email again and it had the youtube link to the gun misfiring over and over and over again. I told him that I would like my gun replaced overnight with the PT in . with no bullshit and  extra mags as well as them covering the FFL fee or I was going to go ahead and edit the video a bit set some benny hill theme music to it and then spend the next month or so copypasting that video with my full story and pics of the jams in the description to every single gun forum customer review site are you happy with this product site as well as post it as a video response to every gun related youtube video I could find. Id make a hobby of it and every time I looked at my gun and got irritated I would go ahead and call them and chew their asses but while I was on hold Id be copypasting that video everywhere I could find. gtHe agreed to no bullshit they overnighted my gun back to Taurus. Within an hour or  of them receiving it they pulled it and shipped my new gun to my FFL via overnight. I got it this morning with  extra mags to my happy surprise. I put about  rounds through it immediately after signing the transfer paperwork. Shoots beautifully. gtTLDR after close to  years of fighting with taurus they finally did good.gtLinks still no idea wtf causes a jam like this. Im guessing  bad mags? gt gtgtMy new precious Ive decided to name it Fluffy. gt,guns,cff6rpx,6,t5_2qhc8

343331,0,t1_cfgcjjw,Contrary to what the other replies here have said it really depends on their intention when they bought the gun.  If they bought it with the intention to sell it to you then it is illegal on their part but not on yours.  If they bought it with your money again its illegal on their part but not on your part.  The first one is buying a firearm with the intent to sell which requires a license.  The second one would be committing perjury on federal form  when it asks if they are the actual purchaser of the firearm.  In neither case would you be breaking the law.  If they literally bought the gun as a part of their collection didnt like it and then sold it to you it would be perfectly legal for both of you.Edit  uMotorBoater has pointed out that I am incorrect in stating that OP would not be breaking the law in the first two examples.  I stand corrected.  The last case is still perfectly legal for both parties.,guns,cfgctdp,-2,t5_2qhc8

Associated with IO Inc and Royal Tiger Imports.        If you watch the fifth video it shows them rivet the trunnion with barrel this is the improper way to rivet an AK possibly shearing the rivets and having the front of the rifle fall off in your hands.      IO Inc Royal Tiger and Pioneer arms are on my avoid list. Equal to CTD for poor customer service as well as dangerous and dubious practices.

Lots of FDE OD Mossy Oak Real Tree etc out there now. Winter hunters might use whites and grays.The third stage is any color you want like the pink pistols marketed to ladies and the Hello Kitty ARs.

Keep in mind that the mm was selected for war not gun fights.

It is most definitely cheaper than a Model  by a lot actually with a Zamak frame. It was a police tradein by FIEArminius Im amazed that it was a duty gun. The steel parts have made extra room for themselves in the frame hence the poor lockup. The barrel has  thousandths of wiggle in it. It is my please steal this gun and dont bother looking for other guns gun. I have too much gun paraphernalia around the house for any halfcompetent burglar to not come to the conclusion that there might be firearm someplace. I might upgrade it to my truck gun but I want something a little nicer.My point is that Ive seen Smiths and Rugers and even Colts with equally shitty lockup. With lead wadcutters the same thing could happen to them as its partially an ammo problem. Ive yet to see a Taurus with better lockup. And it doesnt have to be bad timing to cause bullet or powder debris to bring a revolver to a halt either. Edit for the record I still use this gun and work around its problems by using with jacketed ammo and keeping it clean. Do I trust it  percent? No but not enough to not use it occasionally and the same would be true for other similarlyshitty guns. ,guns,cfnty95,1,t5_2qhc8

533114,0,t3_208dps,I have never fired a Vanguard but I do have some experience with various triggers and aftermarket upgrades.I have one magical R factory non Xmark trigger that is just great. It was taken off the rifle taken apart polished put back together and thoroughly tested to make sure there were no safety concerns. It has no creep. None. It breaks at .lbs and gives me a connection to the round with a satisfaction similar to the way a wellmade German sports car without power steering connects one to the road.I have never ever been able to find a Remington brand trigger that is anywhere near as good. Not an Xmark not an X  and boy have I tried. It was a fluke in my favor.My other Rems have gotten Timneys and they are as good if not better then said magical trigger.The Savage Accutrigger is great and I will not be replacing it on my current build. Not as good as the Timney but the difference isnt enough to be worth replacing.Do you like your rifle as it is? Do you consistently put a hole where you need it to be? Does the click of the trigger happen before you can react to a shot? Can you feel the pin hit the primer in the tip of your finger? Do you even care?

I suppose you could also cut the tang and install an ACE folding stock hinge with the adapter for an AR collapsing stock. On the business end youd probably have to go without a muzzle device on a  barrel. That would probably make the shortest rifle possible. I guess you could also bullpup an AK or try to find one of these but they tend to look gross and of course have shitty triggers. IMO the bestlooking bullpup kit is the kushnapup.

566117,0,t1_cg4kd72,Do you mean that the retaining pin holes doesnt line up when the gas port holes are lined up? or that you simply cant get the retaining pin holes to line up when installed on the gun?If its the first then either your block or gas tube is out of spec. You might be able to fix this yourself by pinning the tube in the disassembled gasblock mark the tube through the hole in the gas block and then drill a new hole in the gas tube at the right location.This could however result in some gas leakage from the gas tube depending on where the original hole was.If your gas block and tube both are to spec and you simply cant fit them together when you are building the gun then simply not pinning it would result in the gas holes in the block and tube would not be lined up either and the gun wouldnt cycle.If you dont have the gas tube pinned at all it would be allowed to slide back and forward in the block meaning that the gas port holes would not be lined up.,guns,cg4mfqe,2,t5_2qhc8

AZ and a few other states have it right as far as gun laws go and I will choose to live in AZ instead of back east.The main problem with your situation is that the ATF says that you are no longer a resident of CT while NY most likely says that their law requires you to live in NY for some amount of time.

Keep in mind youll be adding to your safe with either ammo or more guns or the old ladies jewelry from grandma and all of that will use up quite a bit more space.

When youre actually loading it to fire just let the bolt fly forward. It has to do that on follow up shots anyway.Also keep in mind that the SKS is designed to prevent firing out of battery. The bolt has to be locked forward before the trigger engages at all. On the off chance the hammer drops anyway it will strike the bottom edge of the bolt red part bottom right corner in zaptals linked diagram instead of the firing pin if the bolt is anywhere besides locked forward.,guns,cgeolih,1,t5_2qhc8

721639,0,t1_cgm34a8,A larger primer has more juice in it and can ignite the powder even faster than a smaller one. This causes extra pressure because of the primer and the the load going up faster.Say you have a Small Pistol Primer SPP and a Small Magnum Primer SMP. Youre reloading mm with same bullets and powder and accoring to your books youre at max sammi pressure for mm which would be k psi. Now say you put a SMP on it with everything else being the same you would get higher pressures pushing you over the max pressure and causing an unsafe situation.Generally in newly manufactured guns this wont be enough to ruin anything but in older or cheaply made guns it could be catastrophic.If youre reloading and want to test different types of primers load to the very minimum powder charge and work up from there and never get go over  of the way between min and max powder charges if youre using a magnum primer where a normal primer is called for.,guns,cgmaxy1,3,t5_2qhc8

752230,0,t3_22m5vi,TEXASFrom a TSRA emailThis week in Austin  the Senate Committee on Agriculture Rural Affairs and Homeland Security held an interim study.  The committee is chaired by twotime Doc Brown Award winner Senator Craig Estes RWichita Falls.  The purpose of an interim study is to gather information and report to the Texas Senate when the Legislature meets in .   The committee was assigned five topics referred to as charges.  Two of the five charges Border issues and Second Amendment issues were discussed on Monday April th. There was only time for one Second Amendment issue due to the intense interest and the numbers of public witnesses for and against licensed or unlicensed open carry of a handgun.   Both the NRA lobbyist and I spoke in favor of open carry.  I led with the history and the background to support the restoration of rights for Texas handgun owners. The NRA lobbyist followed explaining the number of states with either unlicensed open carry or licensed open carry.  C.J. Grisham spoke representing Open Carry Texas followed by two opposing groups Hilary Rand for Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America and Frances Schenkkan for Texas Gun Sense.   Threeminute public testimony was then offered.  Testimony lasted from noon until .  All were heard. The Legislature is not currently in session so there is no bill and no vote.  This is strictly an opportunity to gather and share information with the Senate.  There has never been an open carry bill filed in the Senate and there has never been a vote in either Chamber on the issue.  Both gubernatorial candidates support Open Carry so this may be the right time to restore rights lost to Texans many years ago.

761320,0,t3_22vege,My best guess is a dummy round of some sort. Holes drilled in rounds are usually to show the users that it is an inert projectile. That is definitely just the projectile. It would be easier to identify if it had the full case to see if it had a real primer that had been struck or a primer that has space to put wax in it which would indicate it was a training or dummy round for maintenance and practice. Not having any quarter pounder experience it is tough to really make a confident call. If you can find a manual they usually have a section detailing tools and parts for the guns and if this is a training or maintenance round it would be in there.EDITIt looks like there is a place on Wikipedia to download the manuals. Also looking at the projectiles on wikipedia the hole in the bottom is for fuses. Id say it is a demilled round now with the other holes showing it is inert. Kind of a keepsake. I keep shells from my first gun shoots as keepsakes and nothing else. ,guns,cgqtgtw,1,t5_2qhc8

Most Nagants are mismatched because the importers found a neat little loophole where they could cheaply import surplus weapons if they were disassembled. They ordered thousands of receivers thousands of barrels and thousands of cylinders. Then put them all back together. A lot of them came mismatched from Soviet surpluses too. acp cylinders are not that common. Even if they were its not like there were people putting stock cylinders back on sealing them back up in crates with loads of cosmolene and selling them back to the public!

Tapco makes low quality accessories that are popular to people who think that SKSs can be AKs with just a few added parts. Poor quality control and customer service. The biggest problem is the cheap plastic they use. Now not all things they have done are as awful as I make it seem such as the G triggers and I have liking to the Timbersmith line of stocks.

I choose to fear guns because theyre extremely dangerous no matter who is wielding them. you may brush this off as totally hypothetical but your argument is the same ill stop the bad guy because im a good guy. The cut and dried of it is it is much safer to live in a place where people dont have guns.

883410,0,t3_248o4d,You can kill or seriously injure someone with a slingshot or a BB gun but that does not mean that they are a good choice for self defense.  LR is common it is responsible for a large number of firearm deaths because of its wide usage not because it is remotely comparable to a decent defense round.  There are a number of reasons that most centerfire cartridges are a better choice.Reliability.  Rimfire is cheap but it is not as reliable as even cheap centerfire ammo.  Not to mention the rimmed cases are a pain to feed reliably.  While penetration is king in terminal ballistic analysis wound cavity and expansion effects are also important.   rounds that achieve satisfactory penetration completely sacrifice everything else.  The other aspect is comparison.  lr has dramatically inferior ballistics to rounds that are pretty widely regarded as sub optimal for effective defensive ammunition.  .x would be the smallest I can think of and a number of agencies are moving away from that for something that has a little more stopping power.  In combat shooting you go for combat accuracy.  Yes you can kill just about anyone with a  if you have your choice of location but a real world scenario involves moving targets that are probably shooting back.  If you can manage to keep your hits within an  circle in the upper chest during those conditions you are surpassing the expectations of some of the most elite fighting organizations on the planet.  Expecting to hit a weak spot is unrealistic.  ,guns,ch4p3na,4,t5_2qhc8

The thing to take away from this is that the velocity plays a much MUCH larger role than a small change in mass will. Bigger calibers are nice because they mushroom wider assuming you buy hollowpoints which you should regardless of caliber but the difference is small.

So my question is if the ATF has this rule why is it not on the form as well. gtQuestion . State of Residence The State in which an individual resides. An individual resides in a State if he or she is present in a State with the intention of making a home in that State. If an individual is a member of the Armed Forces on active duty his or her State of residence also is the State in which his or her permanent duty station is located.If you are a U.S. citizen with two States of residence you should list your current residence address in response to question  e.g. if you are buying a firearm while staying at your weekend home in State X you should list your address in State X in response to question .It gives the same example for both questions. So if what you say is the case then why is it not on the form? Example As long as the person can prove residency in MN with a picture ID that matches the address and form  is filled out I can sell them a handgun. I do not know if they weekend here or work here. The ATF does not require me to ask a person if they work or have a life in MN when selling a gun. As far as life what does that mean I enjoy fishing owning a cabin and spending weekend in this state. That should count. Again either every gun store I worked for is doing it wrong they totally could be or it seems like the ATF might have some rule but it is not stated on the forms or forced at all. ,guns,ch6c60l,1,t5_2qhc8

You should reread them again until you understand them.The cognitive abilities of the  per cent of people who started in their s  who could loosely be classed as college smokers  also suffered while they were still smoking.One study demonstrated a doubling in lung cancer for male marijuana smokers who also used tobacco i.e. for men who smoked the same amount the risk of lung cancer was twice as high for men who also used marijuana. Another study found that longterm use of marijuana increased the risk of lung cancer in young adults  and under with the risk increasing in proportion to the amount of marijuana smoked.Many of the carcinogens and cocarcinogens present in tobacco smoke are also present in smoke from marijuana.Marijuana smoking does cause inflammation and cell damage and it has been associated with precancerous changes in lung tissue.Marijuana has been shown to cause immune system dysfunction possibly predisposing individuals to cancer.Marijuana likely increases the risk of testicular cancer prostate cancer cervical cancer a type of brain tumor and the risk of leukemia in the offspring of women who use it during pregnancy.Etc.Areas that decriminalized cannabis also saw major increases of cannabis use amongst teens. And many of the ill effects of cannabis use seen in adolescents are almost certainly affecting adults as well. And yes I do want you to cite studies which debunk my claims.,guns,chb3ca6,-16,t5_2qhc8

Say a CCW applicant has voiced their opinion supporting or opposing gay marriage immigration reform the ACA abortion etc. What if the person who was issuing permits thought the applicants position not illegal but was immoral?

By simply exercising their first amendment right they are not allowed their second amendment right.I find it mind boggling that a newspaper could turn its head to something like this. Would it be the same thing if this were applied to journalists and the first amendment? Lets try a scenario. What if in order to publish articles you had to have a POL Public Opinion License. If the person issuing this license did not have the same views as the journalist thinking they were immoral they would not approve the license. Sniff would say the journalist would be allowed to have those opinions at home but not in public. This is reasonable and in the public interest. How might it play out if the journalist had a POL and was critical of the Sheriff in an article or voiced opinions they did not agree with would they have their license revoked or not renewed? At what point does it stop would the Sheriff have to approve all articles before being published? Again only to be reasonable and for the public interest.The role of law enforcement is not to cast moral judgement but to enforce the law and uphold the constitution. The Sheriff should not be allowed to violate our second amendment rights in the same way he is not allowed to violate the first fourth fifth and all the others. Sniff seems to think that he does not need to uphold ALL of the constitution for ALL of the people. There are many instances where members of law enforcement the military and others have made statements along the lines of I might not agree with or like what you have to say but I will stand and fight for your right to say it. If he were a true leader then Sniff would do the same. Instead he picks and chooses what he likes about our freedoms and doles out permissions only when he sees fit. This unAmerican attitude and Stan Sniff is not what our community deserves. We need to change this with the election of Chad Bianco. ,guns,chfyx2m,17,t5_2qhc8

He also  was just fucking around one time drunk at a bar and ended up stabbing himself but he never really gave me the full story on that.I cant remember every detail but he was at a carnivalfestival kind of thing and found a weapons booth and I guess the guy let him try out a knife that came with an ankle sheath. Well the knife ended up stabbing through the sheath and went right into his leg while he was trying it out in front of the booth. He ended up getting the knife for free Basically strongarmed the guy into letting him have it then he had to walk back to his motorcycle and drive  minutes to the nearest hospital. Hes told me a ton of stories like that another one was he and his friend decided to get into a bar brawl while drunk with each other for fun because they liked to beat up on each other apparently and neither of them wanted to back down. The other guy was twice his size and after a few minutes ended up putting him through a glass window where he had to go get stitched up.

996963,0,t3_25ibl6,gtHow much recoil does a typical handgun have? Would it be a challenge to fire rapidly?Varies by weight of the handgun and size of the cartridge.Most modern semiautomatic pistols have light and short trigger pulls which would make it eaiser to shoot rapidly.  Revolvers tend to have heavy and long trigger pulls.  The difference is so pronounced that when the NYPD switched to Glocks and retired their revolvers they modified their Glocks to have trigger pulls that were longheavy.gtHow about with rifles As with handguns depends on the weight of the and cartridge.  A AR in . NATO has substantially less recoil than say a M Garand in ..   Most of the heavierga shotguns have substantially more recoil than the most common rifles in the US.  ga and smaller tends to have much less recoil.gtI am planning on having a scene where a younger character is taught how to shoot properly. How should I go about doing this accurately? Go take a class.Seriously a concealed carry course will probably run you . If not find a coworker who owns a firearm and ask him to take you shooting.gtWhat is the effective range where a person can shoot accurately with a basic handgun? Rifle? Shotgun?Round  yards for the handgunbut most defensive handgun use occurs at less than  yards.  It wouldnt take more than a few hours to instruct someone to hit mansized targets at yds with a rifle.

1002357,0,t1_chi7obi,gtSo did you completely skip reading the article or are you just arguing for the sake of arguing.I read it weeks ago in fact. did you read it?gtFirst off the gougers and the girders are to blame for keeping the shelves bare. While the stores do have some of the blame for not enforcing the policy on ammo limits the biggest problem in the system would be the manufacturers who cant keep up with the market demand. So you are saying the biggest problem in the system would be the manufacturers who cant keep up with the market demand. I think we  agree on this point. what we dont agree on is how to fix the problem of supply not meeting demand. One traditional way which would work just fine in this case is to increase the price of the commodity in question.  I dont see why you disagree with this. Gougers have nothing to do with it. they are merely middle men. If the big box stores would have raised prices like they should have instead of letting the shelves go bare within  hours of receiving shipments day after day week after week there would be less hoarding. when you see a product on the shelf but it costs more than you would like to pay you dont buy all of it you buy less of it. but when you see a product on the shelf that you normally dont see on the shelf you buy all of it with much less regard for price. that is human nature.

I have to Take apart the gun Brainstorm how many angles of what I need rotations of the bolt etc. Snap a full photo to use as a scaling device Snap photos of small groups of parts at closer range for better clarity Prop up certain parts with white foam so I can edit out the background later.  Lots of balancing think house of cards. Take it all to photoshop and set each photo under the st to get scale right Edit the background out of everything mostly manual cutting Put all the parts in one layer so I can do colorcontrastetc to match Break the parts back into different layers some parts like receiver have to be broken into two layers with a front and back Set several major frames in order to get all the parts oriented this requires fiddling Go back and set the parts for each frame.  Ive tried speeding this up but because each part needs to act on another at specific times there is no time saved by using other animation software.  I do one full movement of the bolt. After one full movement of the bolt I animate the safety operation After both of those I just duplicate the bolt animation a few times and change out the magazineammo Then I have to setup all the pieces merge and correct break back out and animate the extractionejection piece basically a separate mini animation because no images are shared Final polishing touches to get all the opacity right and consistent across the different animations I do.

1179984,0,t3_27my2c,Sure. Its a little unusual but this is a servicegrade weapon and it looks to be in good condition. Be sure to practice. The triggers on those guns tend to be a bit rough in double action mode although yours might be better than usual. That first shot is the most important. Think of it as shooting a revolver for the first shot then practice getting right back on the trigger and getting the second shot off as soon as you break the first.When shooting DA guns it helps me to think of it as a backbeat BUMPtiss. For whatever reason that visualization helps me get the two off quickly but without rushing the first shot trying to get to the second. Maybe itll work for you maybe not but do practice.,guns,ci2d9ih,3,t5_2qhc8

1189890,0,t3_27pgqo,Story time When I was hunting for my first pistol I fired a beattoshit rental Kahr PM before settling on a Glock .I am left handed and shoot with a very slight leftside offset as a result of stance and preference.  The Kahr it had ejection issues.  For one it stovepiped at least once per mag.But also it sometimes ejected brass almost straight backfor a right handed person this would probably result in the brass occasionally nicking their right ear.  For a lefty of my arm length it meant I occasionally got tapped deadcenter in the middle of my forehead.I was determined to give this pistol a solid try before settling on something else so the first couple of times it happened I ignored it.  However the third time when the mm brass glanced off my eyebrow fell through my shooting glasses from above and came to rest against my cheekbone in almost the exact manner youve describedwell lets just say that was the last time I fired that particular firearm.Ive since fired Kahrs without any issues I really think it was just a pistol long overdue for maintenance.

1215614,0,t1_ci6ddv4,Oh thanks. Im not quite used to reddit yet.My M isnt an SBR yet. I bought it from CNCwarrior as is folding stockpermanently attached fake can for roughly  after shipping and transfer. The quality on it is much higher than that of my wasr though to be fair my wasr is from when Century had a BAD rep imported in  a full AWB era gun. I havent yet shot my M which keeps me from doing a full comparison every time I try to  go to the range something comes up. The M is kind of an oddball. The rear sight is mounted on the dust cover which is attached via a spring to the front trunnion. The Ms rear sights are absolute dogshit its just a square of metal with a notch in it and it can flip to a different square piece of metal with a notch in it to go between  and  yards. The front sight has a standard post in it though there is also a flip up sight which I cannot comprehend a reason for its existence as it is x as wide as the notch in the rear sight. It doesnt even have glowing paint in it like the old Yugo SKS did.The sights are my only complaint so far other than the fact that it is very front heavy due to the thick fake can on the front which isnt the Ms fault. It feels nice the stock is made by Bonesteel and folds like a Galil does. It has a surprisingly good cheekweld though I wish I had some foam or maybe a paracord wrap on the top to raise it just a hair. It was installed by drilling a hole through the pistol trunnion and mounting it with a single large bolt and milling a few notches on the top for some lips on the stock mechanism to keep it from rotating.,guns,ci6diie,7,t5_2qhc8

They chose the Keen area specifically to move there in numbers so that they could change the laws and culture to how they believe it should be without any thought about the people who are already there and have built the community to how they like it.  I am not a pro law enforcement type but they harass meter maids and insist on exercising their rights at the expense of everyone else the whole super libertarian am I being detained shit after they have been hounding the meter maids and they call the cops sort of shit.  They stand up in town meetings and then wont shut up when their time is up just to disrupt the proceedings then cry repression when they are removed from the meeting.  They want their voice heard while shouting down everyone else.My biggest beef is that they think that it is ok to just come in and change things because they can.  They are just as bad if not worse than the Massholes because at least the Massholes arent right up in your face for the most part.Here in NH we have long been a fairly libertarian state that values personal rights and responsibility but we have our own brand of it.  The free staters bring their hard nose brand and it just clashes with the local culture and makes people pissed off me for example.Are they legally allowed to do what the do... yes.

If you weld on the barrel you will change the temper and hardness level of the barrel. This could cause the barrel to crack or rupture. The stresses imparted could prove to much for the barrel and all your work could be for nothing. I think it would be worth looking considering soldering or brazing as alternatives to welding as the temperatures are much lower and wont change the metallurgy.

1439633,0,t1_ciwokp8,gt  You dont need to cite it every time you correctly point out rape is wrong you only need the knowledge. Its not about when its wrong its about wrong to who. The rapist and the rape victim dont experience the same consequences. gt Because you claim that the rapist is committing a moral act. The rapist commits an immoral act not a moral one. Not if the rapist values the rapes consequences as the highest end bundle. In the context of hisher value system which is the only place obligation may be derived it is moral. The mistake is to believe that I have the same value system  or that anyone else does for that matter. gt How morally bankrupt are you that right and wrong doesnt convey deep meaning? Id like to reference a lot of Max Stirner here but its likely his standalones wont bridge the gap in our perspectives. I was like most people once before I asked questions more questions. People who believe in objective morality cant answers questions to deep causation. Why shouldnt I kill someone? Because its wrong. Why is it wrong? Because it hurts the person. Why should I care if it hurts the person? Why should that care assuming it exists trump everything else? Now the person who believes in objective morality exits the conversation under the guise of disgust. In reality they cannot express get down to the true should. The real obligation lies on a level lower than what people will dive into. Just as a side note I do not dismiss empathy in costbenefit analyses. Empathizing with the pain of the victim counts as a cost. Furthermore theres a lack of deep meaning when white lies are wrong and so is grotesque torture. How can we possibly speak of those two things as if theyre in the same category? Those two things can only be described in the same way if were on a very superficial level of analysis. gt  your rapist is morally justified in raping someone.  That justification is to himself. He has justified to himself with his valuation. He is not justified to others. Now Ill ask again why should we be alright with his actions just because hes fulfilled obligations to himself? Your answer can only be We shouldnt. Thats the moment you have to admit that Im not prorape. gt That is objectively untrue. It is a degrading violent act against another person without justification and that makes it immoral not moral. No it doesnt. Whats going to happen is Im going to keep asking why until you demonstrate that youre appealing to values. Then Im going to ask why the rapist should care about your value system. When you fail to come up with a reason Im going to tell you thats exactly why the only way we can generate obligation through our own value systems. We can proceed if youd like. Why shouldnt I harm someone else? gt Your claims indicate that as long as there is no law against murder and your cost benefit analysis allows it murder is moral. Your wording is imprecise. Under those circumstances I am morally obligated to murder  yes. gt That is obviously objectively false violently taking a life without justification is immoral. Justification to whom? The justification is my valuation. ,guns,ciwqgc5,-2,t5_2qhc8

A few weeks later the threats came to a head with saying a attack would happen within days. I open carried every day during that period noticed a couple suspicious vehicles then the threats stopped.

Why I couldnt tell you might have to do with manufacturer preference. Anyway the reason for the long pull is it is near impossible to get a DA out of a shorter range of movement since you have to actuate the firing pin and drop the sear. With a SA pistol you only have to drop the sear. My experience with an XDMs SA trigger says you can have a polymer pistol without a mile long trigger pull.,guns,cj07al1,2,t5_2qhc8

1468747,0,t1_cizpgtn,Yes because OFAC only affects the transfer of funds not goods. So any financial institution that does business with US banks or in the US is subject to OFAC sanctions and would reject a distribution of funds to an account held by kalishnikov. Also any bank subject to OFAC cannot open an account for kalishnikov. So essentially theres nothing the government can do to stop products that kalishnikov produces from entering the country.  Theyre only able to stop funds from going from US companies or citizens entities from here out to kalishnikov. Now if the government can prove that a middleman only exists to transfer funds between US entities and kalishnikov the middleman could be added to the OFAC sanctions and tried for money laundering. To this point the US has not made significant effort to crack down on foreign money launderers but they could.Now what someone would likely actually do because this is what real money launderers do is create a web of companies in different countries with different banks and run the goods and funds through the web of companies and countries to where it becomes very difficult to track and prove the flow of funds from US entities to kalishnikov. Itll take some time for the webs to get set up but kalishnikov products will keep coming to the US. ,guns,cj0dsmh,3,t5_2qhc8

Rounds fumbled onto the ground while loaded.  About  out of   users slamming the butt of their shotgun on the ground to clear a sticky chamber.  Shortstroke misfeeds.  Running dry at the worst time.The autos while not being as mechanically reliable yet as a simple pump may actually have the advantage when you factor in the operator errors.

1547501,0,t1_cja5yyp,It can definitely be worth it but the gun has to have sights that are user modifiable and the gun itself has to be accurate enough to justify putting better sights on it.  is definitely accurate enough and deserves good irons. Get some Tech Sights on that thing and a x scope if youd prefer one. Luckily .s are very forgiving of cheap glass so a simple x should do it. The WASR has practical accuracy but its not quite enough to justify putting better iron sights or scopes on it a red dot sight will be enough. The Mosins an unusual case because Mosins can have excellent accuracy. It depends on the rifle. If it is accurate enough you should put the Mosin scope mount and a good scope on it. Now your Winchester...theres a piece that deserves upgraded irons. Get yourself a good aperture rear sight and a better front post if desired and youll see the difference. The M Garand has good stock sights but its used for competition around the world so theres bound to be competition sights floating around. As for upgrading from stock sights in general it all depends on what ranges you usually shoot at. If you usually shoot at closer ranges or want a sight for defensive use a red dot sight is a good upgrade. If you want to shoot further scopes are the way to go. If you want to shoot more accurately with iron sights then upgraded iron sights are the clear path to take. There are also middle ground sights like magnified reddot sights or lowmagnification combat scopes ACOGs etc which split the difference between magnified and nonmagnified. It all depends on what you want to do with your gun. Usually stock irons will do the job adequately and a lot of people use them with no issue. If you want to upgrade though you just have to know what you want to do with it first and let that guide you toward your final purchase. ,guns,cja940h,2,t5_2qhc8

The difference between the  situation and the mm is that  headspaces on the rim since it is a revolver cartridge. This means that when shooing  out of a  you essentially get a little freebore and all is well. This is not the case with mm. Being designed for an automatic handgun these cartridges headspace on the case mouth. So while it is possible since the extractor will hold it to the rear of the chamber that is not how it was intended.

1578792,0,t1_cje5xrn,No problem happy to help.  No you do not register a gun with it.  The suppressor has its own serial number and from what I understand the ATF recognizes suppressors as being firearms.  Basically you find a dealer you like buy the suppressor as an individual or start a gun trust and your dealer should help you fill out a form  transfer which is sent in to the ATF with a  payment for the stamp.  Then it will be around a  month wait for them to process the application.  Assuming everything goes well they send the stamp and you can take the suppressor home.  Some dealers will let you visit and if they have a range you can use the suppressor there while you are waiting for ATF approval.  But once you get the stamp you take it home and put in on any gun you want as long as it is rated for the correct caliberbarrel length.  It is not unheard of for people to buy mm cans for their pistol and also use them with  blackout carbine.  Just depends on what the can is rated for.,guns,cje6hed,1,t5_2qhc8

1689081,0,t3_2dppw7,First and foremost secure every gun in the household. Id recommend either in a safe she cant open or at a friends house. If neither of those is an option trigger locks will work but Id make sure there is no loose ammo in the house. Suicide tends to be a sudden decision so making sure there arent any easy ways available is vital.Second get her to a psychiatrist as soon as possible. Id probably say drive her to the ER. If thats not an option keep a close eye on her until Monday then get an emergency appointment with a local doctor. It might be a good idea to have a close family member or friend come over and help keep her company for two reasons. One an extra pair of eyes and hands is never a bad thing and two they can help keep her spirits up.If she cooperates with treatment this shouldnt affect her ability to own or be around firearms. If she has to be forcibly taken it could bar her for life depending on the local laws. I was voluntarily commited to a mental hospital for  days in  and purchased an AR last year in Maryland one of the worst gun rights states in the US.This is going to be rough on both of you. You may need to force her to continue treatment  or take her meds. That said both of you can do this. Being there for her no matter what will help more than almost anything else.If you have any questions or need to vent to a random stranger whos been down that road PM me.Good luck.,guns,cjs2mju,1,t5_2qhc8

If its anything like an AR the lower receiver can be built in half an hour with a hammer and a punch and the upper receiver should be capable of being assembled by any gunsmith or even you two if youve gotget the tools.  The AR will be easier on brass for reloading and inherently more accurate than a Vepr.  Magazines will be cheaper too.I mean to be honest building an AR may be an excellent route for you guys.  You can buy each individual part together assemble it together sight it in together and practice your long range shooting with it together. Thats a lot of fatherson time definitely some sentimental value being made there.  Seriously  hes going to tell his friends about how you and him built your own longrange rifle and you get to say the same to your friends.  Im more of an AK guy myself but even I would enjoy being able to build an AR with my father sometime.This isnt to say a Vepr would be bad though  Veprs are some of the most solidlybuilt rifles out there.

1819777,0,t3_2fefi2,tldr  Take a firearms class before you buy.  They are inexpensive and will make sure this is a right decision for you.This will likely get met hate here but I am a firm believer that CC and firearms for self defense is a decision not to be taken lightly.  I love firearms.  I own them and I shoot them regularly and I cant wait for my new AR upper to come in.  But I am very sure to make sure others  who are doing it are making well informed decisions.CC is is a great option and often very effective at protecting yourself and your family.  However I see with many people that want to get a gun for protection that are relatively new to guns often have not really considered these concepts..Note I do not CC but I am licensed to do so.  I have just decided its not for me.  A firearm is not a magical talisman.  You are not safer just for carrying it as you must be prepared to use it.  If you are not prepared I would actually argue that you are creating a more dangerous situation for yourself and your family..  When you are in a situation where you are required to use it if you use it successfully you are most likely going to be killing another human.   This isnt a movie where you wave it and they run or you shoot them in the leg and they hobble away tails between their legs.  Be mentally and financially prepared to deal with the consequences.  Be prepared that the person attacking you could have been a  year old kid with a family.  Sure you were in the right when you did it you did it to save your life but it can and will weigh on your mind..  You need to practice regularly.  This means time and money.  If you dont know how to draw and fire your pistol safely you are likely putting yourself in more danger..  When you draw your weapon you are drawing it to shoot and kill.  If you are not prepared to do that you have just escalated the situation and the attacker can now draw and fire his own or take the weapon from you..  I am going to repeat  for effect.  You must be prepared for the consequences of killing another human.,guns,ck8gvh6,23,t5_2qhc8

Sporting Clays guns have to be lighter and more agile due to the nature of the game.gt I really dont know why somebody would not put an aftermarket recoil pad on a shotgun.Im not talking about an aftermarket pad.  I agree that theyre a good addition to any gun.  However I was talking about a recoil reducer like a Gracoil or Bump Buster  Totally different animal and isnt something that should be standard on any gun.gt Hand fitting is not a good trait. I would much rather have mechanism utilizing precision machined and CMMed parts that are completely interchangeable with every part of that production run.On the surface I agree with you but making a shotgun by hand is what gives the gun a certain feeling.  No machine made gun has quite the same feel as a hand made gun.  Its the difference between parts and designs that are able to function with a certain tolerance in their fit vs. parts that are fitted together perfectly by hand.  Ive been fortunate to handle a few HampHs and Fabbris and a F.lli. Rizzini which are hand fitted to the highest degree and they just have a feel to them that isnt matched by machine made guns.gt You can still get an F cheaper than a Perazzi Krieghoff Kolar DT.A DT and F are about the same price.   Yes an F is cheaper than the others but its not in the same league as the others.  And to me Fs are overpriced and really so are Perazzis at K I paid K for mine  years ago.   I bought my F for  must be about  years ago.  Now theyre .K.  Theyre not worth that money.  Youre paying too much for the marketing they do.,guns,cka3tjy,2,t5_2qhc8

1855605,0,t1_ck001c3,Smith Optics Elite employee here  Glad you dig the Echos!So the biggest question here is do you want a MilSpec impact set of eyepro or ANSI rated?  MilSpec is  better in impact testing measured in ftlbs of energy.Unfortuately there are no MilSpec rated Rx lenses...which is why we have our Rx insert system that sits behind a MilSpec lens it is a bit cumbersome Ill admit.  This is because companies that can make a MilSpec piece like us do not grind our own Rx lenses.  Since we have to rely on an optometry lab to grind Rx lenses we are unable to be involved with every step of production...which leads to a piece that cannot handle the stresses that a MilSpec piece needs.If youre cool with getting an ANSI certified piece we have a bunch of sunglasses not eyeshields that you can get Rx lenses for in various tints like gray.I hope that helps and sorry it was so long winded!,guns,ckcsn8w,1,t5_2qhc8

Pretty sweet gun with almost no complaints.Hyperbole aside it is the single nicest gun Ive ever shotowned.  Its very similar to my old CZ with the full rails on the inside of the slide but shoots infinitely better to me.  In  rounds not a single malfunction except for one failure to lock back when I let my nephew shoot it but I think he was riding the lock.Fit and finish are incredible and the trigger is the best Ive ever had on a stock gun.  Came with three interchangeable grips and two magazines.My biggest complaints are with the distributer KRISS theyve taken their sweet time getting new models and accessories to market.  No aftermarket sights and mags are impossible to find anywhere except gun broker.Awesome gun overall and if you dont mind the price tagI doubt you could find a nicer shooting DASA gun out there.EDIT  I forgot one complaint the case it comes with could not possibly be more cheaply made.  Youd figure for a  gun theyd make something to protect it a little nicer and more sturdy than wet cardboard.,guns,ckhj5m6,13,t5_2qhc8

Square is either breaking its VISA agreement or has a special arrangement to not specify then.  Do you seriously think that companies give  back on gas purchases for just buying something at a gas store?  No the transactions are coded based on what is purchased.

2000849,0,t1_cku0rez,gtUSPNot according to this testgtA customer came to me last week with his USP . Compact he had just gotten it back from HK who had replaced a broken trigger bar. It has fewer than K rounds through it and is well taken care of. He asked me if I would trust a pistol that broke and was fixed by the factory. I said no. He asked me to run rds through it and see what happened. ...I took his pistol and  magazines My  and  magazines and K rounds of ammo.Both pistols Glock  that had previously been stored in a bucket of salt water and the USP were field stripped and blown completely clean and dry with compressed air. mags were emptied in clean condition to make sure everything was fine.For the fist comparison I threw a couple handfuls of play sand in a bucket.I took each pistol full mag round in the chamber and shook it in the sand for a few seconds. I did this first with the  and it went bang  times as expected.I pulled the USP compact out of the bucketit was loaded but decocked pulled the trigger hammer falls but no bang. I pull the trigger again and still no bang. Not a squib and not a delay. I cycle the slide and eject the cartridge but it fails to go into battery. I repeat while shaking out sand until the magazine is empty. After removing the slide blowing the frame out with compressed air I repeat the test.wont lockBack in the bucket shake attempt to shoot  exact same results. Field strip and blow out with compressed air. This was attempted  times with  different magazines. The first shot did go off once but did not lock up for the following round. Again it required fieldstripping to function.OK it doesnt work in sand. For a different twist I took a UPS mag and a glock mag and threw them in the bucket and shook them up.I picked up the  mag loaded the pistol pulled the trigger  times. I then picked up the USP mag pulled the trigger once and it went bang. The slide failed to close on the second round. Ejecting the nd round partially inserted the rd but also a bunch of sand. The USP mags have basically a shovel extending for the slide stop which proved them useless combined with the sand.Sand is over time for good old potting soil. Potting soil was basically a repeat of the sand. The USP never went bang once. Even with a round in the chamber and numerous hammer strikes nothing.Cycling by hand ejected round but would not lock up on the following round.After that we gave up on the USP and took turns emptying the several full  mags.Ill return the customers pistol and his  rounds. This USP compact went bang every time clean so it works fine. I would never trust it though as a carry piece.   ,guns,ckuavd6,2,t5_2qhc8

2034528,0,t1_cky3bl1,I dont think this is accurate. If a pistol is made outside the U.S. and imported it probably has a serrated trigger to earn enough points for import into the U.S. ATF has a points system serrated trigger is considered a target trigger thereby earning additional import points. Thats why some Glocks have serrated triggers and others dont. The compacts and subcompacts have serrations as it earns an extra five points. The compacts and subcompacts earn fewer points due to the shorter size. ,guns,ckyflvv,2,t5_2qhc8

It was for me unless you count the guys who hunt and not much else. gt In order to know what i like i have had to pay to rent guns at the nearby shooting range. In addition to that there is a huge barrier to entry just through the prices of most guns.Again what do you expect? At least you can rent before you buy for a bunch of things. In other hobbies it isnt always that simpleor cheap. gt Im afraid to go back to my local gunstore because the pain in the ass salesman judges me for my lack of knowledge and trys to sell me something i dont really want accessories and shit and im  sure everything is the store is overpriced judging by what he is charging for ammo compared to ammo prices onlineCouple things. Like someone else said fuck that guy find a new store. They arent all like that. My first experience as a newbiewho gave up and did not buy anything was probably ten years before I did get into shooting. I was treated worse and never even held a gun at that store. Its a niche market so some storesemployees get like that out of habit because its not like Best Buy where you can buy that dvd played anywhere else. Also online ammo prices and gun prices are almost always cheaper than retail brick and mortar stores so that is not a good indicator of high prices. Compare to other stores for that.gt buying guns online is worse because it looks like i have to place bids and i still have to send it to a local storeFalse and false. On gunbroker you have to bid but there are plenty of online retailers where you buy things as if it was Amazon. And you do not have to send it to a local store. Many of those online retailers have FFL search functions. There are likely many homebased FFLs in your area who almost deal in transfers exclusively usually at a cheaper rate as well. gt In addition to all this every manufacture and their granmothers...i cant really trust any review that i read.Have you ever heard of a guy with the same car as you who had problems that you never did? Everything has the possibility of being a lemon and some people are just hard to please. Do your research here and on forums and go with the best option. Nothing will be perfect.

At the end of it you had Platt staggering around the fallen FBI agents all of who at that point were either incapacitated or no longer had a operable weapon and the only thing that saved a couple of them was the fact that he lost his ability to focus his eyes due to blood loss. Why did the the FBI decide to concentrate on the one bullet that actually killed Platt and not the tactics and behavior of the FBI that caused them to shoot a fifty to a hundredodd shots and only land a small number of potentially lethal hits? Maybe if they were using  mm then that one lucky hit would of incapacitated him.

In my state theres a rule concerning the competency of legal advice. In a nutshell it states that if you arent competent to advise on a particular matter know when to throw in the towel and ask for help.This is actually a portion of the Multistate Professional Responsibility Exam  and is in no way uncommon. Getting an outside opinion andor an expert on a certain subject is near protocol.  The reason they probably dont contact shop owners more often is that their prior experience with them has been more or less like youve described your experience with lawyers.  That means they do some sort of case once ask a bunch of questions and save those questions in some sort of database they can look up when a relevant legal issue arises so they dont have to pay fees twice on it.  tldr take it easy on lawyers bud.,guns,cl4ez50,4,t5_2qhc8

2104655,0,t1_cl24h1e,. Get the book Practical Shooting by brian enos.  Its like Bruce Lees Tao of Jeet Kune Do but for guns and actually better.  I read it once a year.. pistoltraining.com has a bunch of drills on there.  . Master all the basics of handgun manipulation.  Sight alignment and trigger control reloads malfunctions draw fast shooting etc.Dont just go to the range spend  seconds aligning your sights and then slowly pull the trigger.  You need to practice like this draw put  rounds on target reload then  more rounds on target witha par time of  seconds.  Mix it up.  Dont just shoot slow groups.Which is what I see  of the time.   Nobody shoots a slow groupin a selfdefense situation.. Stick with one gun dont keep changing platforms.  As long as its a good gun with good sights and trigger its all Indian very little arrow.Switching guns will slow your progress.  I just shot glocks for  straight years in practice training and competition before I experimented with anything else.  I tried DASA guns SigBeretta for a few months recently just to understand and master the platform.  But Im definitely going back to glocks.  Its never good to become myopic to one thing but worse is to put belief in that its the gun and not you.... its you.. In my mind the most important goal is to be able to draw and put rounds on target fast.  Since IRL this is also what will matter.So I always try to practice from a draw and  of my range time is shooting at speed.  Which is in a hurry but not rushed.

2162904,0,t1_clepn0p,To your credit I did see one person say you have to submit a change of address after your move which would not be a big deal. I will be becoming a CO resident so will probably buy one there. Anyway here are just a few I found via google search...              And while suppressors and AOWs technically do not require a Form  to cross state lines I strongly recommend that in the case of a permanent move you submit a Form  for them in any case so that the NFRTR can be updated to reflect your new state of residence  Yes if the state you are traveling through is a suppressor legal state. Other ATF regulations require a temporary permit for machine guns or short barrel rifles to travel across state lines.   You are correct. Cans dont need permission slips to cross state lines neither do AOWs....everything else does though.   As long as they are legal in the destination state.You dont need to BUT doing so if driving does offer some legal protection if say you have to cross the citystate of Shitcago or some other not gun friendly place....   Option  Maintain Residency in your Old StateThis is the option that I went with. Since I was going to be moving so close to the estimated approval date of my stamp and my apartment required a couple months notice of moving out anyway that they were charging me for I figured it would be easier to maintain a legal residence in the state of Virginia and keep the paperwork processing as normal.The ATF agent I talked to at the SHOT show encouraged me to send a form . as soon as I knew my new address and it instantly raised a red flag for the investigator. They gave me a call I explained the situation and the fact that I was still maintaining a legal residence in Virginia and they proceeded to approve the transfer AND the change of address and mailed them together to my FFL.When the NFA paperwork is approved you then need to travel to the FFL that is holding your device and pick it up in person. Unless you have a trust in which case one of the trustees can pick it up for you. To pick mine up I had to waste a weekend flying to Fairfax VA renting a car picking it up staying the night in a crappy hotel and doing a direct abort back to Texas the next morning. Protip skip the hassle and do the trust.Interesting side note there is no NICS check when you pick up your NFA item. The FFL isnt required to run any background checks or do any verification above and beyond checking that you are who you say you are and signing off on the form . The Form  technically counts as the NICS check so once it is approved theres nothing left between you and your can. Also note that perjury is a crime. Moving on   Your fine moving it across state lines without the . form. For moving across state lines that are NOT MGSuppressor friendly I would ask the BATF. I am pretty sure your safe to pass through but you might want the . just as a CYA kinda insurance.   But it is correct that suppressors and AOWs are exempt from requiring permission to take interstate.   Short answer no you do not need to ask for permission to take a can out of state AS LONG AS YOU ARE ENDING UP IN A SUPPRESSOR FRIENDLY STATE.  ,guns,cler6gk,1,t5_2qhc8

My fiancee works in a rougher part of town and occasionally she will have to go to her job after hours for kennels she works at a vet. Its nice to be able to go with her to the evening kennels when its dark out and be able to look out for her and have that protection if I should ever need it.She is going to be getting her cc in the next month or so and she carries as well. She has a ruger lc that she loves. Im not a huge fan of it.

2222853,0,t1_clmdl30, The next spike appears around  a dramatic increase from the prior . By the end of  as nations struggled to recoup their economies in the wake of the damage wrought by World War I and the Russian Civil War they were summarily hit by the rise of the Great Depression. German hyperinflation and the Versailles treaty coupled with French reindustrialization and the balkanization of former empires in the East meant that military expenditures were at a dramatic low. By  things were on a different footing Germany was consolidated under the leadership of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party in  and rearmament built up a flare of anxieties in neighboring countries. By this time the weapons of World War I were largely obsolete and nations looked to improve their rifle designs. In France in particular the mm Lebel cartridge was showing its age with its odd rimmed boattail design. It and the M rifle were replaced by the new MAS featuring a new unrimmed cartridge. Several upgraded their existing rifles without fundamentally changing them such as the LeeEnfield No.  the Karabiner k MosinNagant M etc.Most nations however were increasingly interested in semiautomatic battle rifles and submachineguns. There had been many experiments successful to varying degrees with semiautomatic designs prior to and during World War I such as the Mondragon rifle the Fedorov Avtomat the Mauser M the Bergman M the VillarPerosa and so on. They generally used cartridges that were too large or enough couldnt be produced or were too complicated too unreliable and so on. By  however several successful designs had finally culminated in practical rifles most notably the famous M Garand and the AVS the progenitor of the later SVT. The Soviets also developed the PPD and later PPSh based on a new cartridge closely based on the German .xmm.This would be followed by developments like the Ljungman and Gewehr  and  and the abandoned MAS thanks to the fall of France which later became the MAS. Despite the proliferation of semiautomatic rifle designs and large numbers of SVTs in Soviet production it was evidently found by military officials that infantry armed with a combination of boltaction rifles and submachine guns were able to produce the same volume of fire and combat effectiveness as troops generally armed with semiautomatic battle rifles  and more importantly producing legions of SMGs and boltactions was cheaper. Thus the semiautomatic battle rifle in combination with the discovery that combat typically took place within ranges that made useless the extended reach of a fullpower rifle cartridge was quickly substituted in favor of the assault rifle. If you havent noticed by now it seems that war might not be a great stimulator of weapons technology given the pressing material demands of modern warfare to outfit immense conscript armies. If anything Id wager that much of the industrial innovation of WWII centered around making weapons more efficient for massproduction A Mosin produced in  required  laborhours  by  it had been reduced to . Id also wager that the utter unparalleled devastation wrought by World War II in combination with the developing Cold War put a damper on innovation as both camps along the Iron Curtain continued trying to provision weapons to prepare for a possible World War III  although with the death of Stalin soon to follow and the softening of the Soviet line after the Cuban missile crisis the paranoia of imminent conflict would soon subside. That and by  the USSR and the rest of Europe was well on its way to recovery. Theres something important to bear in mind regarding the Cold War. As the West and East were increasingly split into two unified but diametrically opposed camps there was pressure amongst them to standardize. Soviet weapon designs proliferated all across the Eastern Bloc and aligned nations in the West NATO too was attempting to bring standardized armaments to bear and began introducing the .xmm xmm and later .xmm. The interaction between the Soviet AK and the .mm M in Vietnam also compelled Soviet leadership to eventually adopt their own mm round the .xmm and its complementary AK rifle However this doesnt represent many cartridges for this time period and raises the question of what constitutes the spike. In truth it seems that most of the cartridges that make up the spike actually come from civilian arms development which probably really took off as those aforementioned production methods made guns even cheaper and more accessible to your average Joe leading what seems to be a lot of innovation amongst hunting and sports shooting cartridges with several producers making proprietary cartridges for their guns. That and a lot of military surplus rifles were rolling out of Europe and selling for a bargain on any mailorder catalogue which increased the general supply of cheap rifles that your average person could tinker and experiment with. With that said though this is largely conjecture on my part. Nevertheless I feel that new cartridge designs expressed mostly the growth of the civilian arms market where new cartridge and weapons designs were no longer so focused around primarily military contracts.Anyway we cant neglect to mention the assault rifle. Of course everyone already knows about it. It melded the increased firepower of semiautomatic technology with smaller intermediate cartridges that would be effective within combat ranges but which didnt feature excessive recoil opening up the potential for automatic fire for increased tactical flexibility. The original assault rifle the StG had its debut in World War II. Its probably one of the coolest looking guns ever IMO. It was followed by the relatively parallel projects of the SKS and AK the former of which had been brought into service experimentally at the end of WWII and then quickly accepted into general service to replace the stillnew SVT and MosinNagant M whose production had largely ceased by  as industries tooled towards the M carbines and new rifle designs.Though the reign of the SKS was ultimately short lived it was still pretty influential. It would remain as a ndline rifle for the Soviets in fact even Mosins remained thirdline for the Soviets for fear of an apocalyptic conflict with the West and would go on to inform other rifle designs like the Czech VZ which featured a proprietary cartridge until pressure from Russia forced them to adopt .xmm. Or the Peoples Liberation Army of China who adopted it in large numbers and still fields it today due to its fairly simple and rugged nature. The AK ultimately overtook it and became the worlds premier assault rifle design with production today having eclipsed more than  units. It proliferated in Soviet service and was adopted widely across the Eastern Bloc as well as shared generously with guerilla fighters across the world as the Cold War accelerated on the periphery of the industrial cores. Of course it was the showdown between battlerifle technology in the US M rifle and the NVAs AK in the jungles of Vietnam which ultimately demonstrated the superiority of the assault rifle and caused the USA to adopt Eugene Stoners M Thats not to say that there werent independent developments the British experimented with the EM and EM prototypes after the war which closely resembled the SA they field today. Heckler and Kosh made the HK and etc. Coincides pretty neatly with the collapse of the Soviet Union and the fall of the Soviet system in the East generally. It was also a time when the affluence of the average American appeared to be in turmoil as the standards of wealth that seemed common in the s and s were eroding in the face of deindustrialization rising crime rates and so on  maybe the civilian market simply had less money to spend on guns? The armies of the world were fairly settled into NATO and Soviet standardizations by this time and still are. Everything past this point representing the last spike consists almost completely of civilian and wildcat cartridges and a few which are hopefully eyeing possible military adoption.,guns,clmdm3c,3,t5_2qhc8

2230257,0,t1_cljqt2c,Yeah ASC is one of my least favorite ranges in SD. PK allows any ammunition legal in California but one time asked me what I was shooting. I said Im shooting . and they said that was okay. I asked why and they said well sometimes people have steel . and dont know it so we check if youre shooting .. Made zero sense to me but I kept my mouth shut because I was shooting bimetal x and . that day. I just rechecked their website and theyve added armor piercing ammunition is not allowed since I moved here so... I suppose you could argue with them that bimetal isnt the same as steel core and its legal to shootown in California so per their PK Range allows any California Legal Ammunition that is in safe condition rule we should be good.Also Ive heard South Bay Rod amp Gun allows any calilegal ammo as does NCSA Pala but never shot either place before.

The traditional gun of the US military was the battlerifle and they made a damn good one you cannot argue the power reliability and first shot accuracy of the M. Its just that war had changed and the battles were getting smaller and taking place at closer range. No longer did massive armies meet in enormous killing fields but engaged at closer range in smaller skirmishes. And battlerifles suck at that. They are great in trench warfare and were adequate for the blitzkrieg of WWII but with the rise of asymmetric and guerilla warfare they became obsolete for the general infantry. It did find its niche as a designated marksman rifle and sniper rifle though being able to effectively engage targets at up to a thousand meters depending on the configuration.,guns,cm1znpd,1,t5_2qhc8

Well the Glock  just came out so I scooped one up as soon as I could find one. She instantly fell in love. Its night and day compared to the Ruger LCP.

Youll need all the parts pictured.So your next question  So now that I have an underfolder can I switch back to a fixed stock?Not very easily.

2541220,0,t3_2ot39g,Others have hit the salient points about quality selection. From a pragmatic standpoint AKs are substantially cheaper to shoot but generally less accurate. I say get both platforms eventually but if you have friends that shoot and have one or the other start there as you can split bulk ammo for range trips and help each other explore accessories and upgrades. I believe that every shooter should be intimately familiar with both platforms and have first hand knowledge of their respective strengths and weaknesses. If youre willing to spend the money you can mitigate the weaknesses inherent to each platform to a large degree something to keep in mind is that there are some things that cant be fixed outside of buying a better rifle so a little more investment up front will save you lots of heartache down the road.

Sorry if its potato quality but its all I got right now. Im concerned about the little nick in the crown.  Im not sure whether or not I caused it while cleaning and Im not sure how to proceed. I feel like if it had happened when cleaning there would be a lot more of them since there wasnt any point where I really forced anything more than I did otherwise. Rod is aluminum with what I believe to be a brass tip connector for the brushes and swaps. Im guessing that its more than possible I caused this?

Some will remember my last post where I acquired the K he brought backWell there was one other gun in his collection this Ithaca New Field Grade ga SidebySide. This one is currently in my dads possession though Ill probably wind up with it. My apologies for the shit pictures took these real quick as I left my parents house because I forgot until right before leaving. As you can hopefully see its in decent shape. There is some oxidation of the metal where the barrels meet the receiver. There are minimal markings on this just the Ithaca name and model on top and the serial below the barrels which is visible when broken open. Couldnt get my phone to focus on it though. My grandfather bought this new for my late grandmother in  or  and aside from some pheasant hunting it hasnt really seen much use.Id be curious what the value is insurance and any more detail on these.

2646277,0,t3_2q7okc,Whats your price range? Do you care if it has target sights? What length barrel are you aiming for. I would recommend old SampW revolvers. In particular I recommend models    and . Models  and  are both . special caliber only. While models  and  both shoot . mag and . special. The models I listed are affordable depending on condition. Models  amp  average around  and up while models  amp  average around . I recommend a revolver with target sights but some say its better to learn how to shoot a revolver with fixed sights. I like target sights because you can make adjustments on the go. The barrel length is subjective. I love shorter barrels    but I tend to love  more nowadays because I think they are sexy. My first revolver was a Taurus. Like others said avoid it. Afterward I got myself a Ruger GP  and a Ruger SP . I did enjoy the Rugers but the trigger pull wasnt as crisp as the old SampW revolvers. Even with trigger jobs on the Rugers it didnt feel right like an old SampW. I also change the springs on the Rugers but it meh. Be careful when buying a new production SampW revolver. The quality control is not as good as back in the day. If you intend to buy newer SampW revolvers check for the barrel. Smith and Wesson been putting out in the market revolvers with canted barrels. The barrel alignment may be off. Recently I encountered a canted SampW  newer production. However they offer a lifetime warranty but still a pain to send a new firearm to be corrected. Good luck friend on you purchase. ,guns,cn400ym,1,t5_2qhc8

When the pilot pull the trigger lever a coupler connects the cam lever with the trigger at it fires every time the propeller axis reaches a certain point.Think of it as one of those crank triggers some people put on their semi automatic rifles to make them fullautoish with the crank being driven by the motor of the plane.What amazes me even more is that before they got the synchronization gear some propellers were fitted with an armored deflector plate so that it could handle the occasional bullet strike from an nonsynchronized machinegun firing through the propeller.,guns,cn438hw,2,t5_2qhc8

Point shooting isnt even a difficult thing to pick up when you have a large target within  yards of you you dont really have to line the sights up. Point the rifle at the target and pull the trigger. Its not like youre shooting precision matches or anything. A shotgun would be no faster to bring up and shoot if you learn to point shoot well.

2702046,0,t1_cnb6idp,gtother brands of tech sights You know this is like saying other brands of Kleenex or other brands of XBox right?  Tech Sights is a company that makes aperture sights similar to those found on American military rifles in the last  years.  And other options will depend on what youre mounting on.   But really there isnt much cheaper that is as function.gtAnd finally why does gunnit hate laser sights? Seems to me like theyd be useful for point shooting one handed and what not.Because they are slow as hell and no more accurate.  The issue is that in a self defense situation youre trying to find that red dot somewhere out in space then trying to align in with a target.  As opposed regular sights where you know exactly where the front sight is you place that over your target and pull the trigger.  Much faster to use your front sight like the Modern Technique has taught us.They are slower and they are no more accurate than a good set of night sights. ,guns,cnb7njt,2,t5_2qhc8

2718651,0,t3_2r631r,I had occasion to see the aftermath of a  shooting.  It was a while back late s and I dont know specific gun or ammo info sorry.  The  round went into the guys shoulder.  He was shot from the side its kind of hard to explain but the entrance wound was into the arm just below the very top.  Another couple inches higher and it would have went into the side of his neck if that helps.The round went through the arm shattering the bone then entered the chest.  The round bounced around inside the guys torso.  There was no exit wound.  He was moving forward with bad intent when shot and I was told that the guy immediately stopped in his tracksthen went right down.  People on the scene tried first aidCPR but he was long gone.  Full disclosure....Ive also seen guys hit multiple times with mms and full s multiple times...and live.  I am a firm believer that shot placement and luck are more important than caliber and ammo.  Dont get me wrong carry as much gun as you can but if you really want firearm protection you need a rifle or a shotgun.

CMP prices are going up as of the time they open on the th of this months but theyve stated that the orders that are in will be charged the old price.  Even though you may be working through some paperwork issues Id stick with it and next time you talk to them enquire as to whether or not youll be able to get the prehike price since your order was submitted before things went up.    I dont feel so badly about selling this rifle for what Im asking to someone that doesnt want to jump through the hoops you have to in order to buy from the CMP but honestly Im asking very close to what they go for on the secondary market and you can get a much nicer rifle from the CMP for that amount.

Lowish magnification maybe x on the low end if youre getting a variable power scope for brighter image. Good brand high quality glass so that what light there is will be minimally attenuated. What brand you go with is going to depend strongly on your budget.I went with a Leupold VXL for my lowlight hunting scope. It has a large objective but with the bottom part cut out so that it can still be mounted relatively low above the bore. I like it a lot.Oh also you would do well to just mount a light on your rifle.

2832782,0,t1_cnq2stz,Right the biggest difference is how the trigger feels on the first shot. DA is a long heavy pull that cocks the hammer as you pull the trigger every shot after that is a short crisp SA break. Striker has the same trigger feel every shot typically heavier than the SA break on most DASA guns. Striker fire has become much more popular on carry guns because you only train one trigger pull and theyre dead simple to operate. No decocking lever and generally no safety to worry about. Chamber a round carefully holster and youre ready to go. DASA would be my preference for a range gun because the SA trigger pull is generally much lighter and crisper which makes target shooting easier and aids accuracy. You never have to use DA if you dont want if youre not carrying. ,guns,cnq2zli,1,t5_2qhc8

Benelli thought they had found a good loophole in r that would let them sell Ms with collapsible stocks and full magazine tubes in the US. They did this by importing Ms sending them to Robar having Robar disassemble them and refinish the guns in NP and then reassembling the guns. In this way Benelli said they were US made.Unfortunately the ATF did not agree so after the first run Benelli and the ATF agreed to stop and the existing guns didnt have to be recalled like theyve done with others...FN for example. Anyway Ive wanted one really bad but when they first came out it was during the Sandy Hook panic and these were hitting K on GunBroker. Fast forward a couple of years and I finally found one on GunBroker still in the box for a reasonable price. Sold my regular Benelli M and picked this guy up. Love it.,guns,con7tkm,20,t5_2qhc8

With the laser you dont have any plastic deformation roll marking and because the heat input from the laser is so targeted the interaction volume is very low to start with there is very little heat affected zone HAZ to start with before you use mechanical means to obfuscate the characters. Because there is no deformation and minimal HAZ backscatter may not be terribly useful but Ive never tried to do that specifically on laser marked samples.

3382686,0,t3_2ywnkq,To be clear I think these laws are pretty dumb. But...The constitution protects your right to bear arms in the same way it protects your right to free speech. The problem is one of interpretation. Does your right to bear arms mean the right to bear whatever arms you want? Nuclear arms? Biological weapons? Does your right to freedom of speech protect your right to say whatever you want? Should you be able to yell fire in a movie theater? Or make threats of violence? There need to be limits. I disagree with the current limits in both cases but to say the constitutional protections on whatever are or should be absolute because of their wording is ignoring reality just as much as anyone who proposes to ban cosmetic features on firearms so that theyll be safer is ignoring reality. I do wish any limits or laws imposed by the government were based on scientific study instead of kneejerk reaction but there are definitely things that a simple thought experiment is all I need to say nope that should be highly regulated. Nuclear weapons for example. Theres no data to suggest that letting U.S. citizens own nuclear weapons is any kind of threat at all. The number of deaths by nuclear detonation is .

3384486,0,t1_cpdojfb,the primary problem is the failure to present unbiased data for everyone to scrutinize that proves the engineering of these firearms is a greater danger then others without it.  before tax money is spent on this wouldnt the proven data on CA prison overpopulation and its inhumane effects be used to improve the lives of American Citizens currently in a state of  cruel and unusual punishment. Amendment VIII  or how about a lack of public attorneys judges and ability to timely process cases creating unreasonable pretrial incarceration times resulting in breaching due process.My point being lets fix the Constitutional violations in progress before drafting law without overwhelming need based on proven data.typically criminals dont follow the law thus banning weapons based on their engineering is irrelevant and will only affect law abiding citizens who by nature comply with law.  automatic weapons are illegal in my state if you do not obtain an ATF class III not banned controlled.  I have no interest in automatic weapons  so I dont care but if I did I would undergo a prolonged investigation and approval process.  criminals on the other hand seek a dealer and buy an automatic weapon .  the ability to purchase one in a store is irrelevant stores keep records background checks cameras... evidence. If you wanted to have a gun which would not immediately lead investigators to you once used in a crime you would not buy it in a store. thus making Tom Dick and Harry  s pistol grip weapons  completely irrelevant to saftey and pursuit of happiness of other citizens by nature they will not be used for crime.,guns,cpe237m,0,t5_2qhc8

She left the boy at a local church. The father at the church didnt like children but he knew that being a disciple of the bible he couldnt possibly not take the small kid. Instead he ended up taking out his frustration on the boy. At the age of three the boy was forced to use the toilet. Let me tell you the little fell into his own pile of poop more than once. By the age of  the boy the boy was reading the bible and chopping wood for the fire. Despite the fathers harsh character the boy loved him and thought of him as his true father.By the age of seven the father raped him three times. The boy ran away. He survived four days in the desert by eating cactus and scorpions. He was finally found by a drug cartel boss who took the boy in. Mr. Sanchez was his name and he was immediately impressed by the boys intelligence and grown up attitude. Mr. Sanchez provided the boy with an education at a private prep school and a nice house. The boy had sex for the first time when he was  the next year he graduated high school. He was the schools star running back. The boy was lost although he liked Mr. Sanchez he never thought of him as his father. The boy went to India were he became a spiritual leader of a large tribe of farmers. With his power he turned the several plots that each tribe member had into a large corporate farm and became a millionaire. His assets grew as he bought into other successful start ups. He often got ahead in business with his great leadership abilities but once in a while he used violence. This was India after all. By the time he was  the boy had all the money he would ever need. So he bought a yacht and traveled the world for  years. For  years he visited every major port slept with girls from every country imaginable and tried every drug ever made by nature and by man. When he was  he was walking on a beach in French Guiana when he met a girl of Irish  Native American decent. She bared his seed. It was boy perfect health. He moved them to Argentina then London and eventually Vermont. The man was  now he has seen everything accomplished everything tried everything. He skied down the Swiss Alps been at the North Pole swam with hammerheads everything! Yet he has never done one simple thing that we all take for granted every day meet his father. He never played catch with his father he never talked about women with his father. He never would get the chance. He died at the age of  when his parachute didnt open when he was base jumping from Dagger Mountain in Washington USA. Over three thousand people attended his funeral.I know what you are thinking.

The evidence for gun controls in terms of gun deaths seems pretty clearcut that where guns are not tightly controlled they pose a threat. I dont personally believe in firearms for selfdefense but I enjoy shooting recreationally and I enjoy hunting. To me it comes down to whether or not there is a better system for middle ground.

3495250,0,t1_cpqmksj,From Stephan Kinsellas book on IPgtAdvocates of IP often justify it on utilitarian grounds. Utilitarians hold that the end of encouraging more innovation and creativity justifies the seemingly immoral means of restricting the freedom of individuals to use their physical property as they see fit. But there are three fundamental problems with justifying any right or law on strictly utilitarian grounds. First let us suppose that wealth or utility could be maximized by adopting certain legal rules the size of the pie is increased. Even then this does not show that these rules are justified. For example one could argue that net utility is enhanced by redistributing half of the wealth of societys richest one percent to its poorest ten percent. But even if stealing some of As property and giving it to Bincreases Bs welfare more than it diminishes As if such a comparison could somehow be made this does not establish that the theft of As property is justified. Wealth maximization is not the goal of law rather the goal is justicegiving each man his due.Even if overall wealth is increased due to IP laws it does not follow that this allegedly desirable result justifies the unethical violation of some individuals rights to use their own property as they see fit.  In addition to ethical problems utilitarianism is not coherent. It necessarily involves making illegitimate interpersonal utility comparisons as when the costs of IP laws are subtracted from the benefits to determine whether such laws are a net benefit.But not all values have a market price in fact none of them do. Mises showed that even for goods that have a market price the price does not serve as a measureof the goods value. Finally even if we set aside the problems of interpersonal utility comparisons and the justice of redistribution and we plow ahead employing standard utilitarian measurement techniques it is not at all clear that IP laws lead to any changeeither an increase or a decreasein overall wealth.It is debatable whether copyrights and patents really are necessary to encourage the production of creative works and inventions or that the incremental gains in innovation outweigh the immense costs of an IP system. Econometric studies do not conclusively show net gains in wealth. Perhaps there would even be moreinnovation if there were no patent laws maybe more money for research and development RampD would be available if it were not being spent on patents and lawsuits. It is possible that companies would have an even greater incentive to innovate if they could not rely on a near twentyyear monopoly. There are undoubtedly costs of the patent system. As noted patents can be obtained only for practical applications of ideas but not for more abstract or theoretical ideas. This skews resources away from theoretical RampD. It is not clear that society is better off with relatively more practical invention and relatively less theoretical research and development. Additionally many inventions are patented for defensive reasons resulting in patent lawyers salaries and patent office fees. This large overhead would be unnecessary if there were no patents. In the absence of patent laws for example companies would not spend money obtaining or defending against such ridiculous patents as those in the Appendix. It simply has not been shown that IP leads to net gains in wealth. But should not those who advocate the use of force against others property have to satisfy a burden of proof? We must remember that when we advocate certain rights and laws and inquire into their legitimacy we are inquiring into the legitimacy and ethics of the use of force. To ask whether a law should be enacted or exist is to ask is it proper to use force against certain people in certain circumstances? It is no wonder that this question is not really addressed by analysis of wealth maximization. Utilitarian analysis is thoroughly confused and bankrupt talk about increasing the size of the pie is methodologically flawed there is no clear evidence that the pie increases with IP rights. Further pie growth does not justify the use of force against the otherwise legitimate property of others. For these reasons utilitarian IP defenses are unpersuasive. ,guns,cpqom6x,0,t5_2qhc8

3514893,0,t3_30gvzh, Firing Pin SafetyPros The gun is completely drop safe. Assuming its the Colt style safety see my Kimber comment for why the Colt one is vastly superior the firing pin is physically unable to touch the primer unless the trigger is pulled.Cons Largely unnecessary especially with the use of titanium firing pins and extra strength firing pin springs More parts which means more parts that could potentially break or wear out although the instances of the firing pin safety parts breaking could probably be counted on one hand Its really unlikely but on both major designs of firing pin safeties its possible for them to not be timed right allowing the hammer to drop before the firing pin safety is fully disengaged. Click when you wanted a bang. Minor annoyance when reassembling the gun from a detail stripThe good news is that the safety is easily and cheaply removed. All you need is a roughly  shim to replace the levers that go in the frame. For that reason I dont personally even consider the firing pin safety when looking at buying a . If you dont mind it like me then it doesnt matter. If you do mind it just remove it. There are way more important aspects of the gun.A lot of people say that the Coltstyle safety will negatively impact the trigger pull the safety is deactivated by the trigger. In my opinion thats totally false. The impact is negligible and only noticeable with a trigger thats under  pounds or so and if youre tuning your trigger to that level youre probably going to remove the safety anyways. Assuming the parts are correctly polished Colt does this other manufacturers may not be as good about it you will likely never notice it. The trigger pull is way more dependent on the searhammer relationship and how those parts are finished and angled to fit together.Tldr Its kinda pointless and dumb but done right shouldnt hurt and if you dont like it then its really easy to remove. It would be unwise to make the presence of a firing pin safety a deal breaker for your purchase.,guns,cpsx94k,3,t5_2qhc8

Usually when I do this I just check the alignment with my eye from the chamber side. But what if you cant do that or want to ensure alignment even more?Geissele offers their alignment rods but they are expensive each. You can go on the low end and order some drill rods from like McMaster for   each. A good option between those and much closer to the low end are the rods from CNC Warrior.They have them in both . and .. The cost is each. What I like is that they have a bevel so the thinner end of the rod goes in the barrel and the bevel sits on the crown. The thicker end goes in to the muzzle device or suppressor. Its a quick and easy way to confirm alignment and takes out a variable that might cost you a baffle or end cap strike on a new suppressor.And it turns out they are local to me in Charlotte NC...so thats cool.,guns,cpxwkb4,8,t5_2qhc8

A straight blowback will have more recoil when you lighten it because less energy is used in moving the slide back meaning greater energy transfer to the end user.  This why pocket guns are generally so unpleasant to shoot.  With delayed blowback the amount of energy transferred to the shooter is the same with a lighter slide due to the mechanical disadvantages used to reduce the amount of pressure released once the slide begins to travel backwards but the energy is applied over a shorter period of time allowing for faster followups.  And because of the shorter period of time in which the pressure is applied it feels like less recoil rather than feeling the same over a shorter period.,guns,cq5e1ir,3,t5_2qhc8

From the sidewalk outside  single shot loud but mistakable for something else. From the neighbor across the street not loud enough to wake her sleeping children if weve got all the doors and windows shut when filming. From the neighbor  houses down all our gunshots sound like someone hammering on wood somewhere in the neighborhood. Basically  just because its loud inside does not mean that your neighbor will call   most people think gunshots are these loud earth shattering sounds because Hollywood  in reality theyre loud but not so loud that youd know one from any other residential loud noise. same house  weve had the cops called on us because my actors looked suspicious but when the patrol car drove up  he hadnt heard or been told anything about gunshots. ,guns,cq6cg6h,3,t5_2qhc8

Read a book. This is such a simplified trivialized propaganda version of the war thatd I expect from a history book in todays vietnam. We didnt invade Vietnam we were let into South vietnam there were two vietnams at the time like SK and NK to quell the VC guerrillas trying to impose communism in South vietnam. Then the North attempted to invade the South. It was a war merely in defense of the capitalist south. We never set foot in NV where we dropped bombs and such. The point is there were millions of South Vietnamese who were for the US and hundreds of thousand more that fought against the North if you want similar comparison many did it because the VC were complete assholes. The US had soldiers who committed war crimes no question and did some bad stuff but you are making up reasons as to why the NVA and VC fought on. For example the VC were fighting before the US got involved. The North and the VC were the aggressors they didnt start fighting or continue fighting because the US raped and murdered entire villages. They were simply fighting to force the South into unification. They werent fighting as some vengeance retribution force to kick out some invader that raped and burned their villages.gtraped and murdered my entire village Implying that the VC didnt rape and murder basically every Vietnamese person who didnt want to join them and the communist cause. The NVA wasnt too kind either.Edit Nevermind Im gone you are a procommunism regime fanboy. You would defend the likes of Stalin Mao and Ho chi minh if you had the chance.

3728144,0,t3_333n0t,The Sig P is an excellent firearm. It has no external safety to turn on or off. Instead it has a decocker for the hammer. Look at the pistol identify the hammer on the rear of the slide. Is the hammer back? If so it is cocked. There is a lever on the left side of the firearm that will decock the hammer and return it to double action. A double action trigger pull on a P is lbs. The trigger will also now be more centered in the trigger guard. If the hammer is already forward and resting against the slide then it is decocked. Do not pull the trigger to check for a safety. I dont know what that other moron is suggesting. Sigs typically do not have an external manual safety. Instead just a decocker. It is a Double Action  Single Action pistol. This means with the hammer down you can pull the trigger and fire the firearm. The first trigger pull both cocks and releases the hammer. Then when the slide is forced back from the energy of the bullet leaving the firearm it will recock the hammer itself. This causes it to be single action at this point with a lighter    lb trigger. If you want to unload the firearm first point it in a safe direction. Drop the magazine with the magazine release located typically on the left side of the grip. Keep your finger off the trigger during this entire process. Pull the slide back with your off hand while holding the firearm firmly with your strong hand. If a round is chambered it will eject safely. Rack the slide a few times to be sure and then lock the slide back and visually inspect the chamber for a round. To see what buttons do what look up a Sig P guide. The Sig Sauer website will have one. If it was oiled properly I doubt there will be rust but you can check after disassembly again consult videos online for this. There are tons. The springs should be fine because they are only worn out from use. ,guns,cqh8eq0,43,t5_2qhc8

You can even head over to rShootingTrips to have a fellow redditor show you the ropes. I also notice that there hasnt been any mention about practice in the thread. A couple of classes will not make you ready for a home invasion. You will want to start setting up a regiment for going to the range and practicing with the gun you eventually will buy. This will help enforce second nature instincts to kick in if you ever have to deal with a home invasion because the adrenaline and possible sleepiness depending on when the hypothetical invasion happens. Its kind of like driving. New drivers can turn into deers in headlights at critical issues vs. more experienced drivers understand their car and can make those second nature reflexes to avoid danger.

3774510,0,t3_33m7pp,All this is just my opinion but here we go. Despite the fact that WW was some of the worst close quarter fighting ever seen the fighting handgun wasnt really seriously considered or thought about in terms of use. Remember it was Cooper who first considered not holding your pistol out in one hand like you were on the range. Secondly many more shots were lethal maybe not instantly but a gut shot with anything had a better than  chance if killing you over time nowadays if your not dead by the time the fire department gets to you chances are youll make it Im a firefightermedic personally I think this has something to do with the psychology if a gunfight. Humans are remarkably good at underestimating and forgetting pain and the knowledge that they will probably survive a shot from a pocket pistol may drive some to care less. Lastly fashion choices and availability of comfortable holsters have made carrying larger pistols in heavier calibers more pactical the same goes for modern lighter firearms that are more resistant to the weather and use.

Its nothing more or less than a bubba of a mil surp rifle one that isnt even all that worthy of bubbaing as by the time you invest in making it good enough you could spend the same money on a Savage Axis and have a better hunting rifle out of the box. Plus you know why Mosins are cheap but other mass produced rifles of the era are not? Because people bought them when they were cheap and bubbaed them reducing numbers of correct ones artificially. You really want to ruin history and do it to a gun that is objectively worse in ergonomics and accuracy than even the cheapest hunting rifle? Good for you but Im better than that.

A Hi Power is completely different from the  by design because John Browning no longer owned any of the  patents.

Generally a single action pull on a DASA is significantly lighter than a stiker fired and generally isnt considered safe for carry when a safety isnt present. Its not so much that bumping the hammer will release it as much as snagging the trigger with such a short pull could release the hammer.

It has the proprietary delta ring thats twistable very nice compared to regular rings tough to mess with when its super fucking cold outside and warm inside.  The ring still works like a normal delta and accepts whatever you wanna put on it such as magpul.  The A front sight is not a true A its a bit fatter the only thing this has affected is accessory mounts the Eliza light mount for a posts will not fit on it.  The bayo lug is a bit on the fat end of the milspec size my m fits still but its a tight fit.  The qd mount under the lug is very nice for slings.  The flip up sight is rugers own it works as well as magpuls.  The a and rear flip up cowitness with any optic designed to cowitness with an a i have a truglo ted dot on mine budget ar for me means budget optic.Sighted the red dot at  shoots where I aim  malfunctions in about  rounds so far.

The birdshot is less likely to penetrate your wall and kill your neighbor if you miss and it doesnt take as much finesse to effectively shoot a shotgun as it does a handgun.

When target shooting there is no rush if you have a malfunction carefully inspect the ammo and the gun and make sure you fully understand what is causing the malfunction before proceeding.

An event on either sends me a text message.  FYI the easy goes off with ANY movement of the nightstand   Every wrong keypad entry sends a text message with a certain amount locking the safe for an undisclosed amount of time.  I have a very long code to reset that timer   Text on power outage   I can preform certain tasks from my smart phone when i get the alerts such as activate the home security system alarm   There are several more but i dont want to give away all the secrets  To clarify for everyone this is meant to protect my children.   Anyone else i would have known of their presence way before they made it that far into my house.  Edit  For the super paranoid telnet  and ssh and every other entry into the Pi are turned off.  SSH can be turned on with a very long password for when i need to get into the Pi and make changes.  I also have passwords for adding one time codes changing the main unlock code andor deleting codes and a reboot code.  nd Edit you need a good quality cellphone backup charger.  The mah isnt as important as the voltage drop when it loses its power source.  For example the first one i bought was way too much and would cause the PI to reboot.  You also need to add a circuit like this so the battery backup go to sleep because the pi sometimes drops below its threshold for current draw.  th Edit There was confusion about whether or not you need a rooted phone for tethering as a backup wifi.  Source Motorola still blocks tethering without a subscription from the carrier.  This can be bypassed by either rooting the phone or following these instructions and then changing the hash in foxfi to something like hello.,guns,cslvkoo,70,t5_2qhc8

I have friends who dump money into a hobby they think they will like before trying it the realize they dont store the shit for a year or so then sell it.  bucks isnt that much money to some people. I have a group of  friends where over the course of like a year did the following They decided biking around would be fun so they all bought bicycles. not walmart bikes like  bikes.  guy took his out literally  times and rode less than  miles combined. I bought it from him for  bucks like  months later.  sold it for like  after riding it a bit and the rd still owns his and it sits in the garage and has had a flat tire for at least a year. They then decided kite boarding was the thing to do. So they dumped about  bucks into buying a used rig spent a couple hundred on lessons took it out  time during the lesson then never again. They played with the training kite more than the real one. Its actually a fun kite I think one of them has the rig still. At some point they liked dirt biking so they bought an old yamaha dirt bike made it go..decided they liked it enough to buy a second bike and some riding gear  had rode a lot when they were younger.  Got bored stopped going sold both bikes for a large loss when they moved instead of just moving them to the new place.All  like motorcycles so one found an R for really cheap so he bought it. He actually road it for a bit then something broke and he got it fixed then stopped riding. Its sat idle in the garage for at least  months now MAYBE  short ride. The other has a CBR parked next to it. He bought it old and used dumped some cash into it dropped it and is just too lazy to go buy the plastics and get it fixed so it sits in the garage next to the R. They had a rd bike came free with the R since it wasnt running Took it apart left it apart after painting...sold it off for parts.They have also owned at least  mopeds  of which was tweaked out and could go like MPH I think all ended up being stolen at some point.Basically...every time they found a hobby at least a grand was dumped into it and nearly every time they got bored and just let it go. Basically...yea its easy to be pretty stupid and careless with money if you make a decent income have few responsibilities and very few bills. And there isnt anything wrong with any of that. What the point of working if you arent going to have fun and they have a lot of fun. Ive made some equally random and useless purchases. That is what hobbies are about. ,guns,csy7tgk,3,t5_2qhc8

When the gun is in the holster the front sight doesnt get a charge while the rear sight is exposed and getting charged. This sucks because now the front sight is dim and the rear is bright making it more difficult to focus on the front sight while shooting.

Because of the frame and corresponding main spring changes grips designed for earlier guns do not fit. I have a KE date code W.

4644480,0,t1_ctftb0a,Ive seen many choke due to the overly tight chamber used by POF.  They use great barrels but screw things up with that chamber.The way that the upper receiver mates to the handguard is hokey to say the least it is screwed on from the top and has the potential to move under recoil and screw with your zero. I have had this very problem with a DI build using a POF receiver set  When these guns get run hard the piston assembly has problems with galling and they like to clog up with carbon at the gas plug which is odd considering they basically ripped off the FAL gas plug design which doesnt have this problem.  There are also problems with the fact that they melonite treat the barrel and extension as a unit and have corrosion problems after the fact since they dont get cleaned all that well afterward.For a . AR I would suggest not running a piston.  The platform was never designed to be used as a piston gun.  The DI guns work great are less complicated and have far fewer proprietary parts.,guns,ctg02r5,0,t5_2qhc8

That being said you would need to upgrade the trigger and some other things to make it better than some other handguns that come stock. I personally dont really like the feel for glocks but thats all personal preference. I have a Walther PPQ which costs a bit more but youd have to upgrade the Glock to get it to perform and feel as nice. Take care of any decent handgun and it will be just as reliable and trustworthy as any Glock. Keep in mind there is a major difference in feel in polymer frame guns and steel frame guns. Polymer guns are light and feel like plastic. I personally prefer the feel of steel guns but I still love my polymer PPQ. ,guns,ctidvmi,1,t5_2qhc8

4674743,0,t3_3ez2mv,Heh. Thats actually fairly good response time in relation to some of the stuff that Ive seen. I worked as a tech up in Alaska with the state troopers. We had one girl drive a dune buggy off of a cliff and her face lost a battle with the upright support. Her passenger was the owner of the buggy and he crawled out with a broken leg clavicle arm ribs and a splattering of lacerations all over his body. He had to walk  miles to the nearest house which drove him an hour to the nearest storeboat launch who boated him another hour to the next nearest store which had a shortwave antenna and was able to reach Juneau who contacted us. In summary it was something like  hours from the time of the crash to the time that we were notified. Another  hours until we could get to him and  hours on top of that to get him to a hospital. Up there you sure as fuck do not want to get hurt because  If you do youll only have the rest of your life to figure your way out of the situation. ,guns,ctjsvkz,18,t5_2qhc8

As mentioned before the two flaps of the tool are inserted in the bolt in the cutout for the rollers. The center notch catches the extractor plunger. Pulling the tool backward will then compress the spring and allow you to insert the extractor.You might be able to use a large set of pliers holding the rear of the bolt head and the tip of the extractor spring plunger.

Vests are rated level  through I believe a being the highest for soft panels. Ceramic rifle plates are rated higher but are in a different category since they are large and not designed for concealed wear. Soft panels are not designed for rifle rounds and theyll go right through. Most police officers wear level a which offers a high degree of protection while still being comfortable enough to wear daily. Obviously the higher level a vest is the more expensive it will be. There are several established brands out there with prices that vary from . Youll want to get professionally sized so you want to find a police supply store that will measure you and order a vest from their supplier for you. Just remember body armor is really not very comfortable. I cant imagine how low the odds are youll need it unless youre in Security or something.

My prices are where they are because these are hand made and not so much because of high raw material prices.

The bell noise allows bears to hear them coming from a distance and not be startled by a hiker accidentally sneaking up on them. This might cause a bear to charge.Visitors should also carry a pepper spray can just in case a bear is encountered. Spraying the pepper into the air will irritate the bears sensitive nose and it will run away.It is also a good idea to keep an eye out for fresh bear scat so you have an idea if bears are in the area. People should be able to recognize the difference between black bear and grizzly bear scat.Black bear droppings are smaller and often contain berries leaves and possibly bits of fur.

You first need to spend some time going to a gun range or two that you can rent a couple different kind of  guns and caliber. mm is likely your best all around caliber cheap easy to find and shoot.  Also I would stick with the big name brands of gun manufactures. MampP Sig Glock Walther HampK   understand EVERYONE will have a different opinion what to get so try a couple different ranges and have an instructor work with both of you on proper shooting.

More seriously it is trivial to make a new firing pin front endwhole new firing pin even if CA came up with some fancy way for it to be impossible to file off the stamp without causing the pin to fail to ignite cartridges. As for the breech face stamp it would be simple to either file it off or fill it in with solder depending on whether it was raised or relief. It is even more trivial to get a shell catcher or use a revolver though. This was pretty clearly at the minimum a law to appease the common sense gun laws morons as well as probably a restriction on gun ownership since microstamping doesnt exist currently. I call them morons because a  minute understanding of the firing system of a gun and basic machining would show how ineffective this would actually be at catching a mildly determined criminal. ,guns,cv2engk,9,t5_2qhc8

Why would they invest the money in machining their own parts if there was no benefit when they could simply buy the MIM parts which are cheaper like you said simply because of the quantity they are made in from a third party like most  manufacturers do?Because nobody offers MIM parts that meet their specifications does not mean that MIM parts can not be made to their specifications.  Again they would bare the cost of production setup.  Its an economics problem.gtWhy are MIM parts cheaper to buy as an individual than bar stock parts?Low quality MIM is cheap when you turn out parts in huge numbers.  Because it would be substantially more expensive.  A CampC machine can make many parts with a change of the software programming.  To change an MIM part means to scrap the molds and commission new ones which is a massive expense.gtWhat we can agree on however is that Springfield builds a good  and the MIM they use is executed very well.Well enough for most.

Some people like shooting  grains and some like shooting  grain. that just how heavy the bullet the thing flying out of your barrel is that for the most part is up to you and usually  grains cost less so people buy that more.

If you can shoot a  decently you should be able to pick up most other handguns and also shoot them decently. If you start flinching on the slightly worse triggers you know you need to work on your trigger control. Avoid Kimber. Their quality control is pretty poor and even if you get a good one theyre still very overpriced for what you get. A Colt or Springfield is a significantly better gun with way better quality control and usually for less money. Standard production Springfields are a little lower quality than standard production Colts but theyre still great guns and some models offer some features Colt doesnt.

That way everything can be worked out ahead of time and you have a roadmap for later. Then you fit the barreled action into the stock by coating it with a transfer ink and carefully pressing it into the wood. Remove only where it makes contact and repeat over and over til the barreled action is at depth.

The longer barrel also makes it easier to aim.Not to mention the thing most people seem to be forgetting is that you shouldnt be clearing your own house anyways. You hide your family in a safe spot setup an ambush spot call the cops and wait.Set your family in a room with only a single entrance take aim through a doorway or down a hallway at the first spot an intruder would approach from and wait. If you see movement shoot until you dont see movement.As far as a load for the  gauge get any kind of buckshot you can find. Many people seem to agree that  buck is pretty much the best shot size but plenty of people rely on  and  as well. Also if you can get magnum loads I would recommend them.

5585134,0,t1_cwpbs98,gtIm not seeing how having a forward grip makes it not a pistol when putting a forward grip on any other pistol makes it an AOWBecause in the NFA a pistol isgt a weapon originally designed made and intended to fire a projectile bullet from one ormore barrels when held in one hand and having a a chambers as an integral parts of or permanently aligned with the bores and b a short stock designed to be gripped by one handand at an angle to and extending below the line of the bores. Which means when you put a forward grip on a pistol its redesigned sufficiently away from an intended use of one handed shooting that it is no longer a pistol   but without a stockunrifled barrel firing shot and with a pistol length it is an AOW.This of course is retarded because you could Shoulder a pistol stabilizing brace while only using one hand  so which redesign matters more? The SBR redesign or the AOW redesign?  Could simultaneously put the foregrip on while shouldering that braceblade. Do what everyone including BATFE law enforcement do with pistols and hold them with two hands   apparently turning them into unregistered AOWs What this CT shop didAOW law shouldve only been about length but if it were only about length BATFE Wouldve had to start talking about why theyre restricting this but not this semiauto and then it wouldve come back to the original tension in the NFAHandguns were supposed to be registered controlled items because of concealment. SBS and SBRS are on there as corollary items because they can also be concealed. But the NFA was rewritten to remove handguns from the registration requirement though the special status lives on   its Federal law which prevents you from say building a rifle receiver into a pistol receiver and  to transfer via the FFL system     and SBR and SBS stayed on!They stayed on!So to prevent handguns from falling into the NFA and inviting lots of scrutiny BATFE when given the task of regulating something like certain sawn off shotguns or pen guns or whatever came up with AOW which was supposed to be the its not a pistol rifleshort shotgunshort or machinegun so its this thing we regulate under the actual rule of concealment interest and invoke the  OALWhich was fine until plenty of manufacturers realized you could totally just fuck with OAL and create weapons that arent legally pistols or AOWs   and not rifles because BATFE generously defined rifles as being weapons with rifled barrels that have stocks all for the sake of really then being interested in barrel length of those rifles   concealment! So now we have this fucking silly looking legally hilarious gun.  Dont even get me started on Ruby Ridge.Meal ticket seeking FBIDEA rejects with dick complexes that still hire out murder squads from the actual Feds that matter when they want people to die. Thats the glorious service of the BATFE and its great interest in people evading NFAcigarette taxes with their super dangerous short barreled brush rifles and loosies sold individually out of state.

That doesnt count in the time picking up brass at the range reading all the reloading materials developing loads chrono all that. Even more time spent with rifle rounds cause I got to tumble resize tumble.

How to improve your accuracy with the FNX is a pretty good post on the FN Forums for any handgun really.I honestly couldnt tell you if a  oclock hold would be considered sight picture  or  however here is an excerpt from the above linked forum thread gtSome old school shooters will tell you to use  but most pistols arent sighted that way. The idea is that the bullets rise above the sight and are thrown into the target. This leaves too much room for error for me though. gt gt   is actually the proper way to shoot targets with. The center edge of the front sight is the aim point. gt gt   is a combat dot sight picture which is perfectly fine as long as the target is bigger than the sights. The front dot is the aim point.gt gt Bottom line with these sight pictures If you choose to use  and  as I suspect most people will you should practice with both of them as often as you can. They both have their place both in target shooting and in a real life gun fight. gt gt Another thing you should also practice is point shooting. I read somewhere that around  of people having been in a gun fight never remember even seeing their sights. This little tutorial is just on the basics though so I wont go over point shooting with you here. But good luck to everyone.,guns,cx3n2xn,1,t5_2qhc8

5729676,0,t3_3h2n36,Fellow Ohioan her. Yes you can carry it concealed. The best reason I can think of is car transportation. You cannot legally have a loaded rifle or shotgun in a car even with your ccw. Making the AR a pistol removes this stipulation and you can toss in the seat next to you if you so choose. Just remember to inform all LEO of both your ccw and any and all legally carried pistols in the car as required by our stupid and undue law. ,guns,cx7blqg,2,t5_2qhc8
5729922,0,t3_3tlxvk,Oh man it sounds like you didnt do any homework or research before going out and buying the kit. The base level of equipment you need for pressing your barrel into your trunnion is good antiseizing lubricant and a ton press. Any gunsmith with experience working on AKs should have something at least as good as this. If your gotos dont have this open up your phonebook and look for gunsmiths and have the first question be are you experienced with building AKs from parts kits or changing out AK barrels?. The way youve worded your post makes me interested in a lot of questions. Did you buy a preheadspaced kit? Is it milled or stamped? If the latter have the trunnions already been riveted to the receiver etc.?AKs require more than just elbow grease and armorers kits and depending on how deep the rabbit hole you go you might require expensivespecialized tools equipment and jigs to assemble one. I recommend going to an AK specific forum and seeing if you can find someone in your area with expertise building from parts kits who can guide you through the process.,guns,cx7cpc4,10,t5_2qhc8

The grip pod and cheap looking rail dont do much. The scope and rings look off and are likely not the most ideal parts either. If you are shooting under  yards at  inch circle targets iron sights and a red dot should be fine. If you want a scope but still within that range and a little more a  scope should do.

5829987,0,t1_cxjtwms,The glass is the most expensive part of any magnified optic because the precision and methodology of how you assemble that glass in the housing determines how clear it is what its eye relief is and so on. The housing is also important because it determines if the glass can actually function properly under realworld conditions read hold zero not shatter the lenses not allow moisture ingress etc and how precise the increments are. Thinner read physically lighter with greater light penetrationclarity glass requires precision engineering not only to ensure clarity but also durability the thinner you get the glass the more fragile it gets unless you get clever with the internal mounting solution. Expensive optics are expected to have both excellent glass and an excellent housing to go with it. Reducing the weight of the housing means that you have to use more expensive materials.

If you can have someone who can teach you gun handling and marksmenship great.  If not find a NRA instructor and take a class or two.  Note learning to shoot is not a one time trip deal.   Youre going to need someone with you at least a few range trips until you get the basics.  Ive taught a lot of novices that still cant keep their finger off the trigger when its supposed to be on the secondthird trip.  Note  Military experience  decent shot.  Ive taught a few former military Air Force how to shoot because their MOS basically required learning how to hold a M in basic. The  Rules on the sidebar and have a teachable attitude.

5877840,0,t3_3vrry9,. For rifle shooting for precision from a rest just let the gun do its thing. Too much body contact too tight of a grip too harsh of a trigger pull and your crosshair is going to bounce around like crazy. Stay relaxed steady your breathing break the trigger close to the end of an exhale. Your greatest enemies are going to be your own breathing and heartbeat. This is why heavy rifles are a good thing.. Dont confuse an inaccurate rifle with inaccurate shooting. Unfamiliarity with a new platform can absolutely KILL your shooting precision namely thanks to the trigger and shooter comfort departments. Youre essentially relearning how to shoot properly and all of that practice you put into learning the nuances of your favorite rifle doesnt necessarily apply.. Along the lines of the last point having an MOA rifle doesnt mean youll shoot MOA in any practical scenario. Theres a huge difference between what your gat is mechanically capable of and what you can humanly accomplish. Dont beat yourself or the rifle up when youre a shitty shot with it. Either practice or find something more tailored to your shooting style. This isnt to discount things that can be objectively mechanically wrong but most times its the shooters fault.. With handguns trigger pull trumps  perfect sight alignment. If you jerk the gun one way or the other during the trigger pull there goes your shot.. Completely opposite to rifles you have to muscle handguns. Give them a good solid grip and fit your hand as high up on the grip as it will go for low bore axis and recoil control. Having a consistent grip is almost as important as trigger control and thats saying a LOT.. AMMO. Dont buy shitty ammo and expect it to do great things for you. You dont need to buy  per round super match grade . but dont go wasting your time with Tula for anything serious.. The firearms industry is one where the rate of diminishing returns is extremely apparent and no one admits it. Buy smart not expensive.. Just because some people can shoot with a red dot or irons out to  doesnt mean its optimal for you. When choosing an optic go with what you think you will be the most comfortable with. Its not always a matter of training everyones eyes are different. Optics are an aid for the shooter aim. If your optic isnt helping you find one that does.. Coors Light is not aiming fluid no matter how much it would like you to think it is.. Hogs must die.. If you dont buy that milsurp you really want youll beat yourself up over it for the rest of your life when you cant find another one.. No seriously go hog hunting.

I wanted to grab some more pics up close of the stock but the weathers been so nasty today I couldnt get anything decent. Here is my Ruger  Altamont Classic V I bought online during Black Friday. This is my first  and I plan on keeping it relatively simple. The only visible upgrades are Tech Sights and a sling. I love the look of this rifle and especially the stock and want to keep it that way but with s a few performance upgrades are a must shown in album.My only concern with this rifle before purchasing was the straight stock. After shooting I can honestly say I cant tell the difference. It feels nice and has not had any effect on my shooting form.The stock is quite a sight. It has the type of traditional look and feel I love. Its a straight stock with a Schnabul end fishscale checkering one large Ruger logo on the right and a small Ruger logo on the bottom front portion. Everything looks well made. I have not found a single imperfection yet.As far as performance its like any other reliable . Im not sure if the  barrel will help with accuracy but I certainly like the way it looks. You can see in the album one of three groups I did today using CCI Standard Velocity with the Tech Sights and a front sandbag from  yards. Seemed to shoot pretty well and looks to have a slight edge in terms of accuracy over my MP .Ive been eyeing up s for a while now but wanted something a little different than the traditional carbine or takedown model and I did not want to go the route of aftermarket parts. I wanted to keep it pretty original. I think I found the right one. I read they only made  of these but that really doesnt mean much to me. Hope you guys enjoyed it.,guns,cxz74iv,6,t5_2qhc8

Under Musollinis reign weapons were numbered with Roman numeral to designate the year of his reign they were made. This one was made in  hence the XVIII mark on the slide. They feature an all steel construction both slide and frame and are quite heavy actually. The magazine release is on the bottom of the grip and you have to push it back to be able to pull the mag free. It is a single action only handgun and the slide will not lock back without a magazine in the weapon once the magazine is removed the slide moves forward so you have to rack the slide for the first round. It is chambered in . ACP. The other unique feature of the weapon is that the safety serves also as the slide lock. This particular example has a nice purple looking sheen to the slides coating and it is in quite excellent shape internally. It only shows some metal corosion on the frame due to the uncoated nature of the steel. The chamber and bore is very nice and bright.,guns,cy5exq8,3,t5_2qhc8

It is an exception to the application of this subsection that the handgun was partially or wholly visible but was carried in a shoulder or belt holster by the license holder.

6065509,0,t1_cyentbm,Keep in mind that to get  in a fullsize  the mag has to extend almost  inches below the base of the frame. Flush fit mags can sometimes hold  but to really do it right with a proper follower and spring the flush fit capacity is .It really is a balancing act. I have a Mark   round and an HK  round. The Mark  has essentially the same grip as a fullsize USP for reference. The HK grip is significantly more ergonomic and slim than the Mark . But it holds less.Admittedly I dont get too worked up over capacity I carry a ... but personally Id give up a few rounds for the sake of ergonomics. Gimme an HK or even a USP over an FNX any day. Especially on a  where honestly capacity isnt first priority thats what mm is for.My first impression of this gun is an enthusiastic who cares?. But I dont fault it for only holding  rounds at least as long as it doesnt have a bricksized grip.Tldr  rounds isnt great but if it was done to allow great ergonomics I dont see a problem.,guns,cyeoi94,12,t5_2qhc8

6070318,0,t1_cyfad25,Although they arent as well known as say Beretta the brand is rapidly gaining a following in the North America.  And dont be fooled anyone who knows anything about guns knows the name CZ and knows they have an excellent reputation. The  is one of the original wonder s and has a very impressive history and track record.Ive handled all of the pistols you listed and owned most of them at one point or another. From my experience a Sig will probably be the nicest stock pistol  they are ergonomic reliable and have a decent stock trigger. If you can find a CZ  SP Shadow that would be my first recommendation. They are the best pistols Ive ever handled and the improved trigger is unbelievable. If you cant get a Shadow the stock trigger on CZs are acceptable but wont be as nice as a Sig so Id recommend a Sig. Glocks are great but the trigger isnt for everyone and some folks wont like the square grip and nonconventional grip angle. And personally I fucking hate the trigger on Berettas. They look awesome and I always find myself wanting one for their aesthetics and because of Hollywood nostalgia but my God the trigger... Anecdote time! Ive bought and sold too many pistols in pursuit of the perfect gun and for me the SP Shadow defines what perfect means.My biggest piece of advice is to try and find a range with rentals to test out each before you buy. If you cant test them out at least get your hands on each one at a store and dry fire it to see how the trigger feels. Pay close attention to how smooth the trigger is is and how crisp the break is. Nothing sucks worse than buying a pistol and realizing you dont like it. ,guns,cyfb2me,4,t5_2qhc8

6079958,0,t3_3ytpd1,Hopefully I can be of some help. Let me address a few things first. To start I would suggest familiarizing yourself with firearms and purchasing a home defense weapon before you attempt to carry concealed. Get lots of practice with it and understand it well. Maybe participate in a practical self defense course... not just for basic safety but one intended to teach you when to shoot when to retreat and the legal consequences of your actions. Also the things that make a weapon good for CCW inherently make it poor at home defense. They are small and light so they recoil heavy. They have short barrels so they are hard to aim. They have small grips so they dont carry lots of ammo. Most are chambered in weaker cartridges so each shot has less stopping power. Do you see what I mean? All of these problems will be multiplied in a high stress situation especially if its dark and you just woke up. Any gun is better than no gun but in a life or death home invasion you would be much better off with a fullsize pistol shotgun or AR. I want to mention your use of the word gun nut to describe your husbands friend who kindly agreed to take you shooting. My immediately reaction was to be annoyed about that derogatory term. I dont know you or your family and it could just be a lighthearted joke... but most would consider it very offensive and people who own multiple guns usually have very reasonable reasons for doing so. Like I said you could just be joking... but in the context of your post and your antigun background it sounded like a sincere insult. Put that behind you and have fun shooting at the range I bet your enjoy yourself and understand better why people are in to guns. However I am concerned that he is taking a new shooter out to shoot shotguns and rifles. I dont know what calibers he plans on shooting but if its to demonstrate home defense I doubt they are .LR the traditional introductory caliber. Watch him shoot them first before you agree to fire any yourself. Nothing will kill a new shooters fun faster than bruising up their shoulder on a  gauge shotgun. Ask him if he has any fullsize mm pistols or  gauge shotguns for you to try. You dont need to dive right into the deep end. FINALLY I will answer your original question. For storing your gun you need to balance accessibility and inaccessibility. You are right about not keeping it in a safe because it wont be any use to you if you cant access it quickly. The correct solution depends on your children themselves. If youre talking toddlers you can just keep it on a high shelf... But since you mentioned them accessing it while not at home I would guess your kids are a little older. You need to first and foremost educate them on firearms. Teach them gun safety let them handle it unloaded take them shooting and make it very clear that all your wrath will fall upon them if they so much as look at the gun when youre not around. Its still wise to hide it as well but by exposing them to firearms it takes away the mystique and gives them less desire to go poking around. If they want to look at it they wont be afraid to ask you. Then you can go take it out of its hiding place unload it and let them see it... or take them to the shooting range.  The idea of your kids handling firearms probably makes you nervous. Im not so out of touch that I dont realize this. Youre probably nervous about them yourself. But if you practice frequently clean the gun and understand how it works... that nervousness goes away very quickly. I grew up in a gun family my wife did not. She didnt even touch one until a few years ago and she was definitely intimidated. But it didnt take long for her to get comfortable around them. Now she shoots the big calibers reloads her own ammo and even cleans MY guns she likes taking them apart.So here is my complete recommendation. Buy a fullsize mm handgun easier to hide than a rifle with a high capacity magazine. Play with some in store and make sure youre strong enough to operate the slide and pull the trigger comfortably. Let the salesperson know youre new. . Before you even buy ammunition attend a gun safety and self defense class. The gun store may even host their own classes and give you a discount for buying a gun from them. At very least they will provide a recommendation. . Buy a quickaccess handgun safe. They are small and use a simple pin number to open. They are designed to be easy to access in the dark especially if you practice. Hide this somewhere out of sight but close by and easy to get to. . Practice practice practice. You need to know how the gun shoots and how to quickly clear any jam that may happen. You should be so familiar with your gun that you can operate it without even thinking. You dont want to be fumbling around looking for the safety when your life is in danger. . Take apart and clean your gun after every range session. I found the best way to take the scariness out of a gun is to see it in pieces and understand how it works. . Once youre familiar and comfortable with your gun start safely introducing it to your children. Dont tell them where you hide it but make it no secret that you own one and nothing they can do will invoke a worse punishment than if they touch it without your permission. . As they get older and you trust them you can maybe move your gun somewhere thats quicker and easier to access. You could also use this time to upgrade your home defense weapon to a rifle or shotgun if you feel the need. At this point you will have probably revisited the idea of a concealed carry weapon and you will be better informed and prepared to make your purchase. Long read hope it was helpful.,guns,cygkd95,12,t5_2qhc8

Also known as x.Headspace is difficult to explain here but lets just say that if the chamber is too large for the ammo youre using when you pull the trigger the firing pin propels the case forward into the chamber instead of collapsing the primer cup onto the anvil in the primer which would activate the priming material.

Per federal law private sellers may only transfer direct to a resident of their same state.

Hell Im no expert with pistols either so take my advice with a healthy dose of salt.With handguns standing unsupported two handed grip speaking in terms accuracy not action shooting I would say at  yards you should have groups of about ..At  yards a  group is a reasonable goal.At  yards a  group would be considered fairly proficient.Granted there are a lot of folks who can shoot a lot better than that but I think if youre able to consistently shoot those kinds of groups at those distances you could consider yourself above average when shooting handguns.I can shoot groups like these at these distances with just about anything polymer SA or DA revolvers SADA pistols.  I shoot most anything pretty well because my fundamentals are pretty solid.  I can do a little better when shooting a  but then again theyre my favorite handgun and the one I have the most  years experience with.As for how...practice simple as that.  Lots and lots and lots of practice.  Youll burn through a lot more rounds learning to shoot handguns well vs. rifles.  Shooting handguns is also a very perishable skillif you dont shoot for a month or more youll find that your groups open up considerably.If possible I would suggest shooting once a week probably around  rounds or so.  Much more than that during a single range session and your concentrationfine motor skills start to deteriorate because shooting for accuracy is much more mentally trying than action shooting.  That kind of volume gets expensive quick but a simple reloading setup can help mitigate that some or even allow you to shoot even more for the same amount of money.Dry firing at home helps tremendously.  A couple times a week Ill spend  minutes practicing trigger control with a penny balanced horizontally on the front sight.  I try to get  pulls in a row without  knocking the penny from the sight.Lastly you need to have a solid grasp of sight alignment front sight focus grip trigger control follow through and handeye dominance.

6165061,0,t3_3zyu8b,An interesting thought creeped into the back of my head as Obama talked about how funding care for the mentally ill would be a better way to stop this shootings. If you look at statistics for the mentally ill they actually tend to be victims of crime and violence at a higher rate than normal while committing crimes at a lower rate than normal for the average person. What this has me thinking is that it might be possible that it isnt people who are mentally ill or people that own guns that cause these shootings but people who feel they arent beholden to society like the rest of the citizenry. It might just be that those that are this way are overwhelming mentally ill not the other way around.If that turns out to be true then there really isnt a reason to expand background checks because you cant put a question on there that says do you have a grudge against or feel beholden to society?.

6208503,0,t1_cyujnco,The reason you dont see copper under nickel on a SampW revolver is because it isnt there.No one has shown me any evidence that anyone ever used this method for plating modern double action revolvers.

Colt may have used it I have no idea but until I know they did I have a hard time scaring the shit out of new nickel revolver owners about some mystery layer of copper that no one is sure exists or not.I wholeheatedly agree that fully wiping solvents off of nickel guns is a good idea but thats a good idea for any finish type.If there really is copper under Colt nickel finish by all means be careful.

6268899,0,t1_cz26pmi,I find your assessment odd as well. The only benefit the HK has in my opinion is the grip ergonomics. My USP  has a significantly better trigger than my HK hadeven before I put the match trigger into my USP  and no match trigger available for the HK. The USP is more robust and just as reliableI never had a single failure with my HK or either of my USP s. Federal ammunition has a USP  with over k rounds through it. This sentiment seems to be echoed by the vast majority of users over on the HKPRO as well. For me the HK is just too largelong in grip for its capacity. I would much rather it had a slightly thicker but shorter grip. And the HK Compact didnt do it for me at all unfortunately. I tried to like it. It was better in LEM but still just meh. Oh well.

6284563,0,t3_41oxx2,I am writing this today in light of recent events. Not only todays news but other news and issues as well when it pertains to memes and more importantly meme ownership. So let me preface this by stating I am not a meme person I have never seen a meme in my life that was not on a benis until this year . I am in TX where open carry is now a thing I am also a rather liberal left leaning  year old transman from NY. But do not get me wrong I am not a democrat or republican I consider myself independent as my political views vary from issue to issue on what I feel is best etc. With that said I wanted to share with you here at rguns an opinion of myself which reflects to others maybe most but certainly not all. First and foremost like most people I am anti violence. I am not antimeme I in fact as much as I hate the idea of memes outside of target memeing do fully support the American right to own a meme or multiple memes for recreational activates or personal defense. So whats the deal you may ask why is this guy posting here when he is not against memes? The reason is actually the exact reasons many meme owners lovers and fans I am a fan of things myself use to justify owning memes freely and being able to buy them freely its the people that shitpost not the meme. That argument in itself is completely true a human needs to point and click the human did the bad act the meme was just the tool. The problem though as I see it and many others again maybe most but definitely not all is the justification of using said dank memes. I am not talking about you having a meme on you and being ready willing and able to thwart an asshole terrorist and what have you in fact a giant fuck yeah high five and hand shake to you for assuming some responsibility to protect your fellow Americans and citizens. What I am talking about is the free use of memes specifically to kill when life is NOT in danger. For example the you loot we shoot signs at protests the come and take it from me attitude or these people who shoot someone who is only trespassing. That raises the question to a lot of people when is it not okay to use a meme to kill? In what society is death an appropriate punishment for stealing trespassing etc? As a grown man who does not own a meme never will and never intends on ever shitposting one but has no problem with memes being owned or shit for fun the concern is the wide spread attitude of many not all buy no means not all meme owners and mainly those passionate about memes and meme ownership. To many people like myself that IS the irresponsible part of owning a pepe assuming your frog is judge jury and executioner and that attitude is spread by the loudest and perhaps not the brightest but in no way reflects all meme owners by any stretch of the imagination. Now I understand part of being an American is being able to protect yourself in many ways. But part of being American is also that we have a legal system that allows you to pay for and make up for your mistake people cant do that when killed for looting if you will. My intent with this open letter is not to argue piss anyone off or anything like that but to bring a little more explained POV about sadfrogss from someone who is not the biggest fan of them. Its to let you guys here at rguns know just because someone like myself isnt a rare pep person doesnt mean i we hate them. Its more about the argument many meme owners use about the person behind the meme rather than the meme. People like me need people like here in rguns to be a voice of reason at times seeing as like with many things in life if one side doesnt agree they are ignored. People like myself DO NOT want to take away your memes restrict you from posting them etc I personally want the conversation to be less passion and more logic I am a sportsball fan i am bi myself but that doesnt make me right it makes me passionate. In fact when you are a fan and passionate about something you are rarely right or wrong you are just a human with an opinion. Its just not logical as a life loving human to dank someone for trespassing looting stealing etc its actually more barbaric than meme for an eye I hope this open letter at least opens some eyes that were closed and mainly give you guys here at rguns some faith that there are people out there who are not into advice animals but fully support you. I just dont support the attitude of a benis always being the answer just because you have one. Again I know the meme owners I am talking about it not all or even most meme owners they are just the most vocal. And the most vocal tends to lead social topics. Best of luck to everyone in here with the recent news etc. and here is to hoping  is a more dank year here in the states!,guns,cz3zfnz,11,t5_2qhc8

But this works for me because its primarily used for hunting shorter range out to about  yards or so and there is very little felt recoil even with the gr Buffalo Bore loads.  It does require you to load using the tube but I dont have an issue with it.I only have one complaint and this is a very personal issue.  The front sight is brass tipped so the fluorescent lighting at the range makes it hard to see.  Honestly Im not sure this is entirely due to the lighting or just my eyesight getting worse as I get older.  Only other things I can think of are that it had some chambering issues during the first  rounds but it worked itself out as it was being broken in.  And the stock is not predrilled for a sling.  I dont want to drill it so Im getting one of the Rick Lowe nodrill slings.  But if you want to drill it yourself I believe Mikes has a kit that will work.  ,guns,cz6ogxm,8,t5_2qhc8

6319818,0,t1_cz7zgyq,gtperhaps the PSL will make more sense in this comparison.Youre right. I was thinking PSL when I went to respond but ended up typing SVD for some reason. Too late now.gtTo be fair here the ARAR already lends itself very well to fill the roll of a precision rifle with very little modification.Very true if were talking civilian rifles. The ones in military service arent always quite as optimized as one might like and the use of greentips really doesnt help matters any. AKs are pretty damn accurate rifles in that regard too when youre not using military issued ammo. At least with my WASR and SGL switching from milspec to Hornady brings the groups in from MOA down to . or so and with my DPMS AR switching from greentips to Federal Match loads had a near identical effect. Thats not insignificant.But like always theres a huge difference between what makes a good fighting rifle and what makes a good plinker or hunting rifle.,guns,cz7zs9c,8,t5_2qhc8

6410256,0,t3_43hor6,I took the plunge and bought the brand new Rohrbaughington at a gun show for  including tax. Much better than its predecessors hefty  price tag. Despite mass production and less pretty finishing I think Remington has improved upon the design adding features shooters like such as holdopen on empty ambi mag release on the trigger guard dual recoil springs to improve on useful life and a better beavertail. Ive not held a real Rohrbaugh so I couldnt tell you how finely made they truly were or how much sloppier the Remmy is but I have no regrets from buying this gun. I hold out hope for this gun. Its built at a new facility in Huntsville AL and not in the Ilion NY plant where theyve stuffed production of several other consolidated Freedom Group brands and Remingtons traditional product lines. Coming from a manufacturing background I can see such a clusterfuck causing quality and supply chain issues that are difficult to resolve. So about the gun. It has decent fit and finish. I found no major tooling marks or metal burs. I only ran  rounds of WWB through it but it functioned flawlessly. I like the new features and prefer its mag release to my Walther P that uses the old heeltype that Rohrbaugh used. It comes with  round magazines one flushfitting and one with a pinky extender. Holdopen is good which sealed the deal along with the metal frame over a polymer LCP I was considering. The trigger is pocketpistolterrible. The recoil is quite harsh compared to the LCP. Its also widerbodied with its grip panels but I found that more comfortable with my long fingers. In this guns future it will likely have a red front sight post some fancy VZ grips and I hope to experiment with stronger recoil springs and lighter main springs. In general I like the gun. ,guns,czia5el,4,t5_2qhc8

It had the rear sight assembly replaced by one of those scout mounts and subsequently had the handguard and barrel bands removed as well.Anyway I didnt pay any attention to the rear sight when I picked up the rifle till now but it appears to be some kind of mount for a slideon scope mount.  I dont see any stamps on the part but best I can tell its a late war Russian Capture gun so I cant really trust the stamps.Is the mount an original German thingy or something the Russians added or did another bubba do a good job of adding it at some point?  ,guns,czppvds,2,t5_2qhc8

6499563,0,t1_czrgy4r,The following is from the Economy of North Korea Wikipedia entrygt The postWorld War II division of the Korean Peninsula resulted in imbalances of natural and human resources with disadvantages for both the North and the South. By most economic measures after partition the North was better off in terms of industry and natural resources. The South however had twothirds of the work force. In  about  of Korean heavy industry was in the North but only  of light industry  of agriculture and  of the peninsulas total commerce.Now lets compare that with the equivalent information from the Economy of South Korea entrygt The most significant factor in rapid industrialization was the adoption of an outwardlooking strategy in the early s.citation needed This strategy was particularly wellsuited to that time because of South Koreas poor natural resource endowment low savings rate and tiny domestic market. The strategy promoted economic growth through laborintensive manufactured exports in which South Korea could develop a competitive advantage. Government initiatives played an important role in this process. The inflow of foreign capital was greatly encouraged to supplement the shortage of domestic savings. These efforts enabled South Korea to achieve rapid growth in exports and subsequent increases in income.So thats the simple explanation for why the North was doing better than the South for about  years after the Korean War they relied on the rich mineral resources they had readily available until the South realized they needed to seriously invest in human capital to make up for their lack of resources and betting on people power paid off a lot more than mining materials.Caveats The information for that paragraph in the North Korean section is from a blog that has now been deleted. The information for that paragraph in the South Korean section says Citation needed.,guns,czrlqvk,2,t5_2qhc8

Even if the ammunition manufacturer is the cause close inspection of the pieces can point to the failure initiation point and offer some insight to what happened.Full disclosure Im not an AR guy just an engineer. But even on casual inspection here given that the bolt is still in battery and the way the BCG is split it would sure look like the initial failure point is somewhere around the gas key. Might even be able to take a close look at the metal around there and see if theres any particular spot that looks different from the rest... even just the texture where its split.Id wonder if significant overpressure on firing would have caused this would that have failed the gas tube first? or a manufacturing flaw or some gas venting not working properly.Wonder if  how the bolt could have somehow been stuck locked in there and not allowed the BCG to cycle back. Are there vents in the BCG  bolt on the AR system to give the gas a place to escape?Really interesting to me from a metallurgical and engineering mechanics standpoint.,guns,czvf8ul,52,t5_2qhc8

6557717,0,t1_czxiyh7,I thought about this after reading your comment on the walk over to walmart and heres what I thinkThis is a small company with a kinda shitty website meh CS and a single product enjoying very limited success and far from universal adoption. I honestly dont see them being in business more than  years from now. Their upper is engraved GAH! WHY? right on the side Patent Pending in size  font but that could mean any of the following might happen The company never filed a patent and just did this to discourage copycats. I dun seen it happen befo.   The company filed for a patent and it actually is pending. However it could only be a provisional patent which is good for a year and no more. If they never file the full patent which also takes a fair bit of time then the design is fair game after the year is up.   If the company has filed for a patent hasnt received it but goes under before the patent is granted the entity which filed the patent AR Five Seven LLC no longer exists and the USPTO has noone to grant the patent to. In this case the original inventor can petition the USPTO to ammend the patent and grant it in hisher name but this isnt automatic.   If the company has filed for a patent recevies it before going bankrupt and then later does go bankrupt the patent is considered part of the companys assets as IP and will either be auctioned off by the bank or sold during winding up.Since I have zero actual information those are all the plausible scenarios. Only time will tell which one ends up being true.,guns,czxmegy,1,t5_2qhc8

I dont mind the white  dot sights but you can grab truglos. The grip isnt bad but Talon makes a wrap for the grip that looks nice. Not sure how it feels. You can always add a thin strip of grip tape to the front of the trigger guard for better handling. It is pretty smooth and my finger slides a lot.

No matter what the stick is made ofhow big it is if its designed for the pistol to come off when you tug at it its at risk for popping off in other circumstances.  Especially even a minor car accident.  The last thing you want is your weapon bouncing around the cabin.The trigger is uncovered.  Things can snag on it and if not nd a round further increase the risk of the weapon becoming unholstered.

Depth of penetration depends on the amount of gun powder. Thus it varies by manufacturers and by the length of your barrel. For example a mm can expand to . doubling its . diameter while a . SampW can expand from . to . and . Auto from . to .. On average most JHP for mm is about . expansion . for . SampW and . for . ACP. So one can say that a mm is about as good as a . a . is as good as . and a . is a good as a .. HOWEVER a mm is nothing like a . and a . is nothing like a mm. ,guns,d058da7,1,t5_2qhc8

6657495,0,t3_46uemt,My favorite rifle is the Mosin Nagant. It doesnt need oil at all and its so satisfying when you shoot it its like getting drop kicked in the shoulder. You dont even need to reload the mosin theyre so cheap that you can just buy a new one when the ammo runs out. The best part about shooting them is the visit to to chiropractor after youre done shooting it. Or if you cant get to one just use the next shot to put your shoulder back into place. I actually keep a mosin around the house and use it as a hammer or if someone breaks in i can use it as a club or pike i also use the bayonet to make shishkabobs when babooshka isnt around. I once put the bayonet on the gun and stood up i took a one foot chunk of plaster out of the ceiling and my wife wouldnt talk to me for a week. And the smell when you buy  of them you open the crate and are met with the smell of cosmoline low grade shellac and the  year old blood of facist pigs long dead. When i was on the pole vault team during high school i find that the long poles were too flimsy so i just used my mosin nagant I won first place. When i was in the navy i found that the deck cannons were too small and secretly replaced them with mosin nagants we destroyed  ships that day. One time i ran over a mosin nagant my car exploded destroying the  mosins in my trunk... the thing wasnt even loaded and luckily i have another  at home so it wasnt a big loss. One time i was out camping and had no firewood so i shot a tree. It was blown in half and now i had firewood. Once i forgot my lighter at home but had my trusty mosin with me so i tried to light a cigarette with it i destroyed the cigarette and my entire upper body. I once went to an airsoft battle with my mosin and fired blanks i won. When i was on my high school baseball team i realized that bats are too expensive so i used my mosin every time i hit the ball it was so far away that rifles were banned from my baseball team. Instead of lawn darts my family used mosin nagants for fun theyre  times as lethal for th the price. Once when i ran out of ammo and didnt have another mosin handy i just rigged it to shoot chain linked ammo. Once when i was playing moses in a kindergarten play god wouldnt part the waters for me so i just fired my mosin and the waters parted. Instead of truck nuts i hang a mosin nagant on my trailer hitch. When going across the volga everyone forgot their boat oars so we just used our mosins. When target shooting i have to have the target at  meters away because at  the muzzle is going through the target. The mosin nagant has fought in many wars against itself and has won every time. I shot a mosin nagant at work once and its muzzle flash set off the sprinkler system. Once i was out of firewood and had  mosins in the trunk of my car so i piled up  of them shot the pile and ended up starting a forest fire in an area with no trees. One of my mosins came free with the purchase of a bayonet. I once Shot a mosin into the ground that area is now known as the Vredefort crater.,guns,d07xy4c,3,t5_2qhc8

From your original question yes if you buy a stripped receiver assuming used the dealer should list it as an other on the  since thats the configuration it was in when they transferred it to you. What you dont know is what it was transferred as the first time. ATF can trace it from the manufacturers end. If it left the factory as a PGO that is good.

No matter how great the skill of the user they arent going to create precision that is not in the pistol itself. Characteristics of the pistol like a good trigger pull easy to use sights and grips that fit can make it easier for the shooter to get all the mechanical precision out of the pistol.

CC to defend your life.If you do CC do not draw or even hover around your CCW except in defense of your life the only exception is if there is a tangible threat to another persons life that involves lethal force such as if someone is being choked or stabbed to death. Most CCW owners prefer mm over . or .. This is because with modern defensive ammunition mm offers equivalent performance to . and near equivalent performance to . you trade marginal increases in expansion were talking a few hundredths of an inch and penetration for lower recoil which makes it easier to place shots on target quickly and accurately less expensive ammunition meaning more practice and more ammunition for a given frame size. If you prefer steel thats fine but be aware that steel is heavy. It might shoot very nice and soft but this thing is going to be riding on your belt all day. With a good gun belt and holster its less of a problem but it will still be heavy. A lot of people in fact the majority prefer striker fired for CCW because it offers a consistent trigger pull with no hammer to snag and generally no safeties to switch off. The usual preference is the Glock  as its the right size for both shootability and concealability. The Glock  is the . equivalent. s are finicky things. My stance on s for carry is that you either go premium for the good stuff or not at all. SIGs are great guns but their hammer fired guns are expensive except for the SP and a few of their CCW pieces and their slides are beefy. The slide size is great when youre shooting it but an SP is wider than a Beretta FS.IWB is the preferred CCW style because it does not a jacket and can be easily and completely hidden from casual view with an untucked shirt. A pancake or shoulder holster would require a jacket that you would have to wear the entire day. ,guns,d0apkuf,3,t5_2qhc8

Dont bother unless the hammer actually bites you because the dropin safeties dont look very good and I personally wouldnt spend the money for a gunsmith fit safety unless the factory one was just intolerable. Besides the rat tail safety on your pistol is IMO the best grip safety for concealed carry. Theyre also popular with Colt guys and Ive seen them sell on ebay for over .. I highly doubt that barrel is worn out people dont really buy Officer models intending to shoot the tensofthousands of rounds required to wear out a Colt barrel. Could be wrong but Id be surprised.. Cheap magazines will ruin your day dont skimp on magazines they are the number  cause of malfunctions in s. Cheapest that still function reliably would probably be Checkmate though.

6693587,0,t1_d0bo10f,I dont remember federal law off the top of my head but you also have to consider state law. Based on your username I assume youre in WA. In that case RCW .. defines a pistol asgt  Pistol means any firearm with a barrel less than sixteen inches in length or is designed to be held and fired by the use of a single hand.This sounds like it would include SBRs but it doesnt because  gt  Shortbarreled rifle means a rifle having one or more barrels less than sixteen inches in length and any weapon made from a rifle by any means of modification if such modified weapon has an overall length of less than twentysix inches.As for using it with your CPL I understand that. I assume youre intending to keep it in your car? Have you looked at the ballistics of . You lose about  velocity between a  and a  barrel. Since a defensive weapon will be used in relatively short proximity do you really need that extra velocity? Will your defensive load of choice still perform as it should at the velocities of a shorter barrel? I just really think you should think about that some more. Is this actually the best option for you? In WA you can keep an unloaded rifle in your car. Per RCW .. loaded means  gt  Loaded means  gt a There is a cartridge in the chamber of the firearm  gt b Cartridges are in a clip that is locked in place in the firearm  gt c There is a cartridge in the cylinder of the firearm if the firearm is a revolver  gt d There is a cartridge in the tube or magazine that is inserted in the action or  gt e There is a ball in the barrel and the firearm is capped or primed if the firearm is a muzzle loader.  Thus you can keep a rifle with a loaded mag next to it just not inserted in the action in the car. Then if you need to use it its still relatively quick to access and you not only have a fulllength barrel but the advantage of having a stock also. ,guns,d0bobmm,5,t5_2qhc8

Clearly were talking about stocks not barrels.Also regarding your link lets look at this post which is a picture excerpt of an unspecified ATF letter.Again its still talking about converting from SBR to nonNFA rifle by swapping the barrel not by removing the stock.Finally look here.  Somebody actually called the ATF and the ruling was essentially once an SBR always an SBR.  Its from pscipio about  down the page.  He goes on to include more of the discussion in which it is stated that a guy told me that in order to classify it as a pistol again Id have to submit paperwork to reclassify it.But of course the whole question is clear as mud since were trying to horseshoe letters and statutes that dont exactly cover this scenario into an argument on whether a simple stock removal makes transporting an SBR without a . okay.  And the ATF is the poster child for unclear and contradictory rulings.I would personally not recommend suggesting that someone can simply take the stock off an SBR and be okay legally not without very clear asscoverage in the form of an ATF letter or legal case that outlines that particular scenario.  I think its irresponsible to recommend an endrun around paperwork that can destroy lives if the arresting officer gets a bug up his butt that day and the ATF decides to make a legal precedent out of the poor guy.  It may be true that the ATF doesnt care and will never know.  But an SBRs an SBR and the transport form requirement exists.  ,guns,d0cke5o,1,t5_2qhc8

6739158,0,t1_d0g71hj,Please dont spread false information.  SampW doesnt use and has never used cast internals in their revolvers.  That was Ruger and they did it very well.  SampWs older blued preMIM revolvers have triggers hammers rebound slides hands and cylinder latches are all made from hard steel then case hardened to make the surfaces even harder and more wear resistant. It was very rare to see any of these parts actually wear out. It is quite common to see trigger and hammer studs pivot pins wear oval and very common to see the slot for the hand pawl or the slot for the cylinder latch wear wider. Because these slots were in the frame it is always more common to see a frame wear out before there is any significant wear on the internal parts. When SampW first started making stainless steel revolvers the picture changed. As an example earlier Mod s had stainless steel hammers and triggers that did not hold up as well no doubt because the stainless alloys are not as hard as the color case hardened carbon steel parts. Live fire life expectancy with a Kframe  Special is typically  rounds with some going as high as  rounds. A good tuneup with endshake bearings an oversized hand and oversize cylinder latch will put the revolver back in service for another k rounds. The  has a much shorter life span typically under  rounds with  Mag loads and  rounds with  Specials. This has nothing to do with MIM or forged parts. Its mostly the weak yoke tube and frame slots. When MIM parts started being used SampW redesigned the DA revolvers with internal firing pins rather than hammer nose firing pins in older models. Nearly all internal parts are now made with the MIM process. This was a huge change for SampW because people didnt understand the merits of MIM parts. Instead of handfitting MIM parts can be made with exacting tolerances where they are dropin no hand fitting required. This cut production costs immensely. SampW then heat treats and case hardens the parts significantly. The surfaces of MIM parts are actually harder than the older forged and machined parts and are also smoother. This increases their life expectancy considerably as long as Bubba doesnt get in the gun with a file or sear stone. Because SampW never has changed the yoke tube or frame slots the average live fire life expectancy of a blued SampW MIM revolver is about the same as preMIM but stainless MIM models that tend to last much longer than previous models with stainless triggers and hammers.Ruger was the industry leader in developing cast gun parts. Many people confuse modern cast gun parts with cast iron properties and insist on guns with forged and machined parts.  Rugers subsidiary Pine Tree Casting produces cast alloys that are every bit as hard and strong as the older SampW forged parts. Try drilling a hole in any Ruger hammer and you will see what I mean. Rugers concept with cast parts is to make them very close to finished size then machine the final mating surfaces to spec. Of course this requires hand fitting many of the parts which has its good and bad points. Hand fitting is better for tolerance control but it makes it where the owner cant order parts for a DIY project. Instead the gun has to be sent back to the factory to have those specific parts fitted. Rugers approach to building DA revolvers is much different than SampWs. SampWs depend on very tight tolerances. If SampWs get out of spec the gun may fail. Ruger has very loose tolerances on most of the parts. This increases wear. A good example is the way triggers and hammers are set up. In an older SampW there is a boss located on the frame and another boss on the side plate where the hammer and trigger studs are located. These bosses provide a very tight tolerance to keep the hammer and trigger from moving sideways the slightest amount. Ruger hammers and trigger flop around quite a bit on their pivot pins so much that hammers often scrape the frame on one side or the other. Ruger builds their frames very stronger and more importantly their crane tubes yoke tube in SampWs are thicker.  The only improvement Ruger could do for their DAs is to use MIM parts. Why? Ruger spends very little time cleaning up their cast parts so it is not unusual to see rough mating surfaces that definitely show up in coarser function trigger pull!. MIM parts are much smoother so it would reduce a lot of the binds and gags we commonly see. MIM parts would also eliminate handfitting.In conclusion MIM parts tend to last longer and function smoother. Ruger stainless parts are far superior to SampWs stainless parts. SampWs forged steel parts and Rugers cast parts are a tossup both last a very long time. Being old school I do like older SampWs with forged and machined parts mostly because I know these guns were literally hand fitted.  But the modern SampWs with hardened and heat treated MIM parts make for a very beautiful action.  ,guns,d0gdxyq,13,t5_2qhc8

6783529,0,t3_48mhm9,West Virginia   HB  Law restoring constitutional carry in WV has passed the house after being amended in the senate. Currently sitting on the governors desk for him to sign. Apparently he hasnt changed his stance on vetoing it but both houses have enough majority to override his veto. According to the state website he has  days to act on the bill or it automatically becomes law he should be acting on it by the end of the week. EDIT I would just like to add that the only reason the bill had to go back to the house is that the senate amended the mandatory prison sentence for a felony committed with a firearm from  years to  years. I find it odd that politicians are against constitutional carry because of safety but yet they dont want to actually punish the people using firearms in crimes. UpdateTomblin vetoed the bill today. The bill will now go back through the senate and house or just one I dont really know. All it has to do is get a simple majority  of the vote not a  and itll go into law anyway. Two weeks left in the legislative session. Tomblin pretty much did it just to make himself look good. Unless a lot of people change their mind itll pass regardless. ,guns,d0l764s,5,t5_2qhc8

They were for close range shooting of big and dangerous game within  yards of the prey elephants rhinos and tigers. They were designed for blackpowder weapons and are so big because blackpowder has a relatively low maximum velocity it can accelerate a projectile to so they made up for it with having enormous quarter pound lead projectiles. Once smokeless powder became standard they fell out of favor because you dont need such a big bullet since you can make a smaller one go faster and hit harder.

Even with a proper muzzle brake and recoil system xmm is likely to produce upwards of  lbs of recoil over  lbs with no brake and no recoil dampening system.Id say come up with a mounted cannon if you really want to do this. If you are dead set on shoulder fired there is a remote chance you could get xmm down to a manageable recoil though even with the recoil system on an M Apache helicopter nose cannon it still has a nominal recoil force of  lbs.,guns,d0vdarc,5,t5_2qhc8

6906704,0,t3_4abl60,New YorkYou know those funny looking ARs we have?  As seen here with thordson FRS stock and here with a spur grip  Well according to a major New York compliant AR manufacturer DSI located right here in NY they have received a visit from the New York State Police and are being told these stocks now qualify the weapon as an Assault Weapon and are hereby banned.No official statement has been released by the New York State Police but needless to say this is massive as it would effectively ban any type of AR or Ak Not including the Saiga those are still find.  Below is the quote from the owner of the DSI the shop who claims to have been visited. NYSP SAFE Act Update Effective March   we have been advised by the New York State Police Troop L Gun Investigation Unit that their official determinations have now been made on a number of items and configurations of semiautomatic rifles under the SAFE Act. We have requested they provide a formal notification in writing which we expect to see in the next  days.  We are working with our attorneys as well as attorneys representing some of the component manufacturers to explore legal challenge options.  Below is a summary of what we have been advised Any featureless configuration on an AR or AK style receiver is NOT compliant.  This includes the Spur the Thordsen FRS the Monsterman the Boar and all other similar items where the hand is below the action of the rifle. Featureless rifles including the Mini  Saiga Sporter Ruger  Ares SCR etc. where the hand is behind the action of the rifle ARE compliant. The AR MagLock mechanism which allows removal of the magazine when the action is open is NOT compliant. The DS FX series fixed magazine receiver and rifles which are manufactured as a fixed magazine ARE compliant.This information is subject to change and clarification.  No other clarifications have been issued at this time leaving some products still in the grey area.  As always we are not attorneys and do not offer legal advice we are only trying to pass along information as it becomes available to us.Note Some are claiming this is a publicity move by DSI to push their fixed magazine ARs.  Bullshit.  The owner of DSI is not a stupid man and he knows how to use social media Hes on several local forums.  He knows what the backlash would be against his company if it was determined that they made this up.Either way I do expect this to reignite New Yorks distaste for the SAFE Act.  Remember nearly every county in New York has resolved to oppose the SAFE Act  This also raises the massive issue that these rifles have been sold as Legal since the Safe Act passed in .  There is conservatively s of these rifles now in NYS unregistered and supposedly illegal.  No word on what these people will have to do with their rifles but under the SAFE Act if you discover your rifle is illegal and were previously unaware you have  days to register it Once registered you can do anything you want to it.  Muzzle brake pistol grip adjustable stock ect.  The time to register technically closed years ago.Edit This may not be all that entirely different from the ATF ruling on whats legal and what isnt.  In our case you have the state police executive defining the SAFE Act rather then a legislative or judical branch.,guns,d0z7061,30,t5_2qhc8

I have been wanting to get one these for a while and they were always in the  range. The only difference being the stock color.So I asked the misses if she wanted one since we were talking about getting some lr rifles. So tax returns hit and we jumped I also talked my buddy who i got into shooting recently into buying one as well by using the phrase let talky more pinkyThese both have the factory heavy barrel and a target trigger pack it isnt a BX trigger but it is tuned from the factory from what i can tell.My rifle the black one  VLEH base Whatever bipod that came with it Boyds Gunstock Pro Varmint Weaver Tactical Scope Rings Tactical Solutions Scope base Mueller APT mm .xmm AO Scope  Sunshade Volquartsen Auto Bolt Release Kidd Bolt Buffer Tactical Innovations Fluted XL Charging HandleI still want to drill and epoxy in some QD mounts into the stockThe Ladys rifle.

This was the first time the misses and my buddy had ever shot a lr rifle and they LOVED it. My dad also had his tricked out  and the  of us had a blast. i think everyone went through a brick each.Here is a photo of the range it was a perfect day.

The barrel has a lug on it that the barrel nut acts against to keep the barrel locked to the upper receiver. Depending on how low you can grind the gas block and if you grind off the sling swivel I assume theres no bayonet lug on a NJ gun you might be able to slide the barrel nut over the gas block and muzzle brake.The front handguard retainer is just sheet metal so youll have to cut that with a Dremel.The rear handguard retainer the Delta ring and its spring will probably also need to be Dremeld off although if you can get the barrel nut off the front you should be able to get the Delta ring off the front as well.,guns,d14fqhb,2,t5_2qhc8

7079673,0,t3_4cjxa0,Alright so maybe my intro made no sense to some or maybe Im bad at titles In either case let me start by explaining a little bit. This rifle is an example of the Germans doing just enough to make a military accepted rifle that also functioned well. This is the Gewehr  also known as the Karabiner  the G or the K all correct names for the same gun. Translated it literally means rifle  which is probably the most German name you could give a gun but I digress.In  Germany realized  that a semi automatic rifle firing the standard full size rifle round gave the individual soldier greater firepower and their standard issue Karabiner  would just not be enough on its own. So in  Germany adopted the Gewehr M and W Mauser production and Walther production respectively and long story short the Walther designed system did well the Mauser did not. They adopted the short stroke piston system from the Soviet SVT rifle and thus the Geweher and its new gas system was born. The rifle performed well and at the end of the war nearly  were made no small feat for essentially two and a half years to build while having the factories and concentration camps that built these bombed by the Allies. The designation K or Karabiner  was given supposedly at the request of Hitler but more realistically this rifle is a couple inches shorter than a Karabiner  Mauser rifle so calling it a Karabiner  Carbine model  is technically accurate.On to the rifle we can start to see some of the finer details here. For reference the rifle marked G is a  BerlinLubecker production and the rifle marked K scoped rifle is a late  production also a Berlin Lubecker manufactured rifle. Some things to note from intitial impressions the handguards have a fantastic deep red stained look to them while they are actually made from Bakelite. Youll also notice the finish on the receiver looks just awful. This is because the receiver being polished and smoothed out was deemed unnecessary to the production of these rifles and once these forged receivers were made they were pretty much assembled into guns. The inside of these guns however is pretty fantastic. The insides and any moving mechanical surface that was deemed necessary was polished and finished to turn these into smooth shooting semi auto rifles. On a side note the G has the nicest and lightest trigger I have ever felt on any military surplus gun with a slight creep and then a crisp low weight trigger break. Disassemlbly on the rifle is easy as the bolt carrier group all locks together nicely and easily is removed to expose the trigger group and chamber. Now the fun part as some of you have seen I love genuine military sniper rifles or repro whatever works and so getting my hands on a real scope and mount for one of these rifles is awesome. The scopes on these rifles are very handy X power scopes and they themselves are interesting points of discussion. The color of the triangle marking on the scope would be an indicator of the scopes intended use. Green indicated grease was applied that would not be effected by hot weather so use in the Afrikakorps or in warm environments was possible but unlikely due to the dates of production. Blue indicated grease for a cold climate so use in the Ostfront was possible. White Im  sure on this one was used in climates with varying temperatures so that if you went up in a plane and then parachuted down your scope wouldnt fog up from the altitude change but I am not  certain on that one. This scope has no color remaining or was never applied which given its Czechoslavakian origins would make sense. Supposedly the glue holding the lens together was of poor quality and can cause cloudiness which can be seen in the picture. Still though should make a great shooter and on a clear day should be usable enough. These scope  rifle combos were again designed after the SVT which sported the similar PU scope. The Germans wanted a rifle that could readily be converted into a scoped marksmans rifle so most rifles have a rail installed on the side of the rifle for the ZF and ZFK scopes the exception being Buchenwald concentration camp production rifles due to the fact that prisoners were sabatoging parts and having a potentially unsafe rifle or improperly fitted scope rail could make for a disaster on the battlefield. Interestingly enough in the buttstock of some of these rifles are a spare firing pin a firing pin extension a spare extractor and an adorable little manual on how to use the gun and scope!TLDRGun looks like shit is not shit.,guns,d1iugjy,28,t5_2qhc8

Quality is good for the price. It is a top eject so any optic will be a long eye relief scout setup. Side loading gate is my preference once again.

Is the stock intact particularly in front of the wrist and on either side of the lever? The stock is not particularly strong in this area. Is the rib solid? This is generally only a problem on older Superposed guns silver soldered rather than brazed. Check out the choke markings near the breech. Make sure that the guns choked for the use case you want if you plan to shoot trap a skeetskeet gun is probably not going to be great.For  that should either be a mint fieldgrade or runofthemill pigeon grade gun.The Citori and the Superposed feel relatively similar in my hands and the Cynergy doesnt feel right at all but thats just personal preference. ,guns,d1uwora,3,t5_2qhc8

More durableless prone to cracking and superior UV protection.

Not that the original model is terrible as it is obviously stellar  but I really do think this thing is just even more amazing by comparison.Also the fact that both models come riddled with QD sling mounts and unobtrusive tritium illuminated back up irons only adds to its appeal.

You neglect to mention that it has no rail for mounting lights or lasers which is important to the military. Also it IS heavy when you compare it to more modern designs like Glocks or SampW MampPs. Just because it had an improvement over the last handgun the US military used doesnt mean its still just as relevant. And that slide mounted safety is just really dumb.

7209313,0,t3_4e76en,gt I think having a chambered gun in the household is more dangerous then it needs to be.It is true that having around chambered puts the weapon one step closer to being fireable.  However there are reasons that is actually a good thing.  You say then it needs to be but thats not accurate.  More on this in a moment.gt My argument is in the event of a home invasion your going have that second or so to rack a round.Not if youre asleep or in the bathroom working in the backyard bringing things up from the basement in from the car or any number of other situations that remove you from your firearm.  Theres actually a video floating around of a jewelry shop owner being shot and killed as he attempts to draw an rack.  It adds what is sometimes a very crucial moment that can cost you your life.  I dont have the link at the moment because Im on mobile but its out there.  If you decide to search for it know in advance that its NSFL  someone very clearly loses their life and its not a pleasant thing to watch. gt Having your gun chambered does not add any security when its in a drawer however it does create a possibility for an ND.This is poor logic.  First of all theres the example I made above of someone actually being shot while struggling to rack the slide under stress.  Second its one more point of failure if the round fails to go into battery properly.  Yes this happens and some weapons are particularly prone to this. Third as uCorey said NDs are caused by poor weapons handling not being chambered.  If you always follow the four rules which are in most gun subreddit sidebars including this one you shouldnt ever have an ND.  For clarity they are. Assume every gun is loaded.. Never point a gun at something you arent willing to destroy.. Keep your finger off the trigger and out of the trigger guard until your sights are on your target.. Be certain you know what youre targeting and what lies beyond it.If you follow those rules you should never have an ND.  If you dont chamber and dont follow those rules you may well have an ND for the day that you forgot to unchamber or your dad chambered or many other possible scenarios resulting in your gun being chambered when you didnt expect it.  Chambering isnt negligent.  Not following the four rules is.  Thats why its called a negligent discharge.gt Whats your opinions? For home defense should a gun be chambered?gt Im all for it being loaded but not chambered.gt Not if your carrying for protection chambered makes sense.As uDontellmywife has indicated the same logic applies equally to both situations.  Lock up a weapon to keep it secure but if its for home defense keep it chambered.  Now back to you earlier statement that having a chambered gun in the household is more dangerous then it needs to be.  Its a gun.  As a home defense weapon its primary purpose is to end life.  Its dangerous by definition and should be treated as such.  But if your intent is for it to protect you from a home invasion scenario it adds danger by not being ready to use.  It is not more dangerous simply because it is loaded.  If youre following the four rules your mindset should be that it is ALWAYS loaded and chambered.  Your mindset should be that it is no more dangerous when loaded and chambered with the safety off and no less dangerous when it is unloaded is it really? and unchambered is it really? with the safety on. Is it really? Safeties arent alway reliable!  If you do not treat guns in this manner you are not treating them with the care safety and respect they demand.All of that said if a gun is not chambered it just became less likely to help you when you need it most and that is more dangerous than it needs to be.Edit typos and formatting on mobile.,guns,d1xn4u3,4,t5_2qhc8

7470732,0,t3_4hlbjt,Fellow Beretta owner here the Dspring mod and a Wilson combat short reach trigger made my M SOO much better. The Dspring mod drastically changes the trigger pull especially in double action. Get a Dspring from Beretta or a  mainspring will work too. But because you changed the mainspring it makes the slide have less resistance so you can put in a little bit heavier recoil spring to counteract that. Some people recommend it some people say it doesnt matter up to you,guns,d2rdl1p,2,t5_2qhc8

Hopefully its not the lower because that maybe something that you cant fix yourself. Ive also tried a bunch of the different tactical latches for the charging handle some seem nice and other not so much. The BCM mod  is the best but most people arent ready to spend  for a charging handle. Also I do see where you made your sighting error the technique you were using was basically correct however that was intended for use with iron sights only. Sighting in a scope is a bit different but it seems youve figured that out yourself. Like I said earlier at  yards you want to be about  low but try to correct your windage as much as you can to be as close to the center line as possible. When you extend that to  yards you should be on the paper pretty close to center and then you can make your final adjustments. When you are centered at  yards that will actually hold out to  yards due to the natural drop of the bullet.  ,guns,d35krfi,1,t5_2qhc8

7631226,0,t3_4ju7dy,Ive been a Sig fan for a while.  As soon as I bought my first suppressor I looked into what would be the best gun as a host.  All my research into options resulted in a Sig P with a factory threaded barrel.  I read great things about the CZ SP but they didnt offer any with a threaded barrel so Id have to plunk down another  for a threaded barrel and then may need some fitting.  Well I finally found a CZ SP that came with a threaded barrel and had raised suppressor sights.  Bonus is that it came in OD Green which I loved.  Here is a picture comparing the two.  I have yet to shoot and compare the two but I like the added weight of the CZ.  I weighed them both fully loaded with  rounds and the CZ came in at lbs .oz.  The Sig came in at lb . oz.  I have the SRT kit on the Sig so the trigger is definitely superior on that.  If it were factory as the Sig was when I bought it Id put them as pretty close to the same.  Both in DA pull are over what my gauge can measure Id put them pretty equal probably over lbs.  As far as in SA the Sig weighs in at .lbs and the CZ comes in at lbs.  That being said I probably have k rounds through the Sig and none through the CZ so the CZ could end up being about the same.  Also Id like to add the SRS kit to the CZ and see how they compare. I will provide a range report after I shoot both side by side unsuppressed and suppressed.  I plan on selling whichever I like least.Heres the gun for anybody interested ,guns,d39mnmq,15,t5_2qhc8

7650893,0,t3_4k3m4i,You shouldnt need to break in your rifle. Just go out and shoot.Edit for more info Gale McMillan the founder of McMillan firearms known for making precision rifles and stocks says its bullshit He claims that the guy who started the myth is one of the big barrelmakers and he knew that by catering to precisionshooters perfectionist mindsets he could get them to go through this BS ritual and shorten the life of their barrels which would result in more barrels being sold as they were being replaced more often.gtIt all got started when a barrel maker that I know started putting breakin instructions in the box with each barrel he shipped a few years ago. I asked him how he figured it would help and his reply was if they shoot  rounds breaking in this barrel thats total life is  rounds and I make  barrels a year just figure how many more barrels I will get to make. He had a point it definately will shorten the barrel life. I have been a barrel maker a fair amount of time and my barrels have set and reset benchrest world records so many times I quit keeping track at one time they held  at one time along with High Power Silhouette Smallbore national and world records and my instructions were to clean as often as possible preferably every  rounds. I inspect every barrel taken off and every new barrel before it is shipped with a bore scope and I will tell you all that I see far more barrels ruined by cleaning rods than I see worn out from normal wear and tear. ,guns,d3bv44x,9,t5_2qhc8

Theres a difference between corporate interests and highvalue individuals interests and she serves the former. I know this seems like splitting hairs but if were going to base our entire rejection of a candidate based on something lets be right about it.Second  her actual policies make sense to me for the most part with the exception of A rights and wanting to bomb every country thats got brown people. Her tax plan is by far the best on the table look at the way she handles capital gains taxes especially to incent investment while treating shortterm gains more like income. I could wax poetic on the train wrecks that are Trumps and Bernies tax plans.Third  every single thing Ive heard out of Trumps mouth has to me indicated he would run this country like a corporation. From pulling forces out of ROK amp Japan to asking our allies to pay us for the security that we provide globally to suggesting that we should just continue to borrow indefinitely because if we default who cares well get our creditors to take a haircut never mind that our creditors are ourselves and our biggest trading partners so how bout them great trade deals?  these might all be great business decisions but they do not reflect how you run a country and they belie either a lack of understanding or a willful ignorance of the dynamics of international policy.This isnt about voting for who has the best personality or who we think is the most genuine. Its about who will set the tone for our international relationships and who will have their finger on the nuclear button. See more in this rant over here,guns,d3f3t6a,-1,t5_2qhc8

7895526,0,t3_4nexea,Ive had a Scorpion for a while now and I bought it for the same reasons you list. I submitted my stamp bought a red dot sight and a bunch of magazines for it and Im still a couple hundred under the cost of the MPX. With the r kit Ill be sitting right around the cost the the bare MPX. Is the Scorpion perfect? No. You need to dremel down the safety selectors or buy replacements. The trigger is a little stiff but a  spring and some time polishing it will solve that issue. Ive shot one with a stock and it makes it a different gun soooo much better.As for the Scorpion carbine I couldnt find one. Or an idea of when they will be available... Or a solid price... It might have changed of the past couple of months since I got my Gen but Im not concerned. As for range with irons I was hitting a  inch plate at  consistently.

7900551,0,t3_4ngs1f,nice post and a good summary of the options available.  I think more detail about shotgun fit and pointing vs aiming would be helpful to those new to scattergats.When the OP says buy a shotgun that feels good its actually more than that.  It is really about buying a shotgun that fits you   specifically is your eye aligned with the barrel when you shoulder the gun.  Your eye acts as the rear sight of the gun.  It should be perfectly aligned atop the barrel and in a straight line to the front bead.  Much like if you look at the sights of a rifle or pistol the front and rear sight are perfect aligned along the axis of the barrel.I have shouldered shotguns that feel great but my eye is not aligned well off to the left.  Others where my eye is correctly centered but either too high see too much of the top rib or too low receiver blocking me from seeing the front bead.Here are a couple of tricks to use to see if the gun fits.If the gun has a mid bead this will make things easier.  Ideally you want the mid bead to be aligned with the front bead.  Either overlapping gun will shoot flatter or in a figure scenario where the front bead is slightly higher than the midbead forming a figure  gun will shoot slightly higher.  Now close your eyes and mount the gun.  Open your eyes.  Are the front and mid beads aligned without the need for you to adjust your shouldershead?  If yes then the gun fits if no then adjustments may be needed to fit the gun.If the gun does not have a mid bead then there is another trick you can do  take a drinking straw and tape it to the front of the barrel so that one end of the straw meets the front bead.  Again close your eyes and mount the gun.  Now open your eyes  can you see the front bead?  If yes then the gun fits. If no and you see the side of the straw then the gun needs adjustment to fit.  The idea behind the straw trick is that unless your eye is aligned to the center of the barrel the straw will block out the view of the front sight.Now if you find that the gun needs minor adjustments then some of the guns on the OP list will be easier to adjust then others.  If you are spending coin on a higher end shotgun then I would go with one with an adjustable comb.  There is a cutout in the stock that you can adjust for height as well as left and right.  This method is the most versatile and should account for the majority of adjustments needed unless you have an unusually strange body or face shape.Alternatively some of the major manufacturers come with shims which allow you make minimal adjustments by placing plastic spacers between the receiver and the stock.  Beretta autos come with a full shim set that allow you to adjust degree of angle how much the stock tilts down as well as left and right bend called cast on or cast off in shotgunning terms.So when shotgunners say buy a gun that fits you they really mean that. Not just that it feels good but one where your eye is correctly aligned on the barrel.  ,guns,d443gxp,10,t5_2qhc8

That told me a lot about CZ at the time.When I bought it I had a choice of the CZ  or the classic CZ  with the round trigger guard and spurstyle hammer.  I kind of wanted the CZ  but I decided that getting the new improved version was the smarter choice.  I regret that so much now.  I was young and stupid.  Im sure that CZ  would have been a great gun.  They offered it in the same cheap painted finish but also in a blued finish.  The CZ  only came in the painted finish.

8014939,0,t3_4p0423,Ok Ill be the idiot that actually engages.. The Constitution was never about hunting it was about personal liberty from tyranny. The guns protected by the second amendment arent for deer its for self defense from criminals and tyrants alike. So saying something should be illegal because you cant hunt with it is a nonsequitur because hunting was not the purpose. The second amendment clearly states the people should have the right to be an armed militia. Militia does NOT mean military.. Even if we throw the Constitution out the window the premise is still wrong.  rounds is nowhere near enough for hunting and competition. In a USPSA round I can shoot as many as  bullets. Include the  rounds and I need my gun to shoot over  rounds. Shooting trap?  rounds minimum.  gun? Who the hell even knows. Even with hunting when go after pests with no bag limit ie hogs in Texas especially ones that travel in large packs ie hogs in Texas and especially ones that could violently attack ie hogs in Texas you definitely want more than  rounds before disassembling your gun.. Lets take it a step further. Lets throw out the Constitution then throw out the criteria you yourself set and just pretend. You do realize a firing pin is literally a metal rod with some of the loosest tolerances in a gun. Seriously look at this AR firing pin and tell me that it would be hard to make I mean I could literally make one with a hand file. Give me a cheap table lathe and I could crank these out in batches.Tldr unconstitutional outright incorrect and easily bypassed.,guns,d4gycl6,6,t5_2qhc8

8053467,0,t3_4pi7gu,Man I love Colin Noir but his first few sentences here made me step back a minute. gt No other country empowers its minorities the way that we do...If I was an outsider to the US I would say that is specious statement to make. How many other countries were lynching blacks and had clan members armed in the s s and s? Was the southern US really a world leader in empowering minorities? Is it even today compared to countries with far less black vs white tension than we have? I would argue no and a good portion of the rest of his video deals with race and stigma related to gun ownership. If we were so empowering would there be a need to address the minoritys oppression of rights? gt We defend minority speech minority opinion and minority gun rights because differences are the foundation of our greatness...Again playing devils advocate here defending speech is not something achieved by firearms. In fact it was the absence of violence that makes any political social movement work. See this post here for a great statement on nonviolent protest  MLK himself advocated passive resistance not armed resistance. The black panthers did not have to shoot anyone to cause harm to the cause of blacks being equals. They did it simply because the open display of power through firearms coupled with aggression made them anything but oppressed. They were viewed rightly or not as the oppressors. MLK might not be the best character model as a person but his message to the black community was one of passive resistance. This is what garnered change. No one fired a shot to get a supreme court ruling. We as a people came together to enact change. Guns were not a part of that process. So again a rather specious statement.  Are minority gun rights really a direct influence on our greatness through difference? I am not sure that argument holds up. Minority rights and majority rights otherwise known as equality seem to be what do that to me. gt  our rights dont ensure the rights of the majority they ensure the rights of the free thinking minority against the majority...OK. I understand the videos overtone is one of overcoming oppression and being secure in your rights. Cool. That last quote though... it makes me wonder. Is it fair to assume I as a white male am the de facto majority? One of the vox populi who has no free thinking ability? This seems to be a broad brush he is using to drive home his point about guns protecting and giving security to those who are oppressed. Even more troubling it creates an US vs THEM in the context of arming ones self. I carry a firearm because I value safety and security of myself and my loved ones. The same reasons I am sure Colin does. The same reasons many of the hundreds of thousands of Americans do. We are white black Latino religious atheists straight gay or furry woofies with unicorn horns. In his video he goes on to make a point how black gangsters dont own black gun culture. He tells us anyone should be able to have firearm ownership accepted regardless of race religion or creed. Cool. This preamble though it implies this dangerous picture that unless you are the minority you are not for the minority. His argument then becomes one of explicit incision instead of implicit inclusion and that I have found is one of the most common and harmful attitudes of gun owner culture in America. You a black kid with sagging pants and a flat brimmed hat? Better not bring a gun to my range boy! Democrats are stupid and sheep. Gun culture normally acts as its own exclusionary group where if you are not with them they are aggressively against you. This is slowly changing but often not fast enough. You win over more people by being open than by drawing battle lines. To Colins credit he addresses some of this later in the video in his talking with Syrian black and gay people. All of those conversations focus on the rights of minorities being protected from the majoritys oppression. Not a bad thing to want to avoid being oppressed but again gay rights back rights womens rights... all did NOT come about through the use of gun ownership. They were not protected as his patriotic speeches suggest by guns. They were protected by laws being changed.  Now I know what he meant to imply or at least I think I do was that those individuals operating against the grain of society can feel more secure because of the universal right to protect themselves from those who wish to harm them for their beliefs. The wording chosen just makes me again feel it borders on the inclusion vs exclusion mindset that I find so dangerous. ,guns,d4laaff,1,t5_2qhc8

8083566,0,t3_4px6mk,You want the Axis or the American. The others may be ok but as far as reputation goes the clear winners here are those two.Generally speaking Savage has a reputation for the absolute best accuracy for hunting rifles out of the box. I guess a good comparison is where many people buy an AR or Rem  and plan to throw  gadgets on it people buy a Savage and plan to zero the thing. Maybe if someone is ambitious they throw a suppressor and bipod on it they leave the guts alone because those things work.Ruger again has a great reputation when it comes to hunting arms. The American series of rifles was almost a sleeper hit with the quality on the guns for the price you pay. Its my belief that in general you pay a premium for the Ruger name but the American series isnt quite going to set you back ridiculously much.Mossberg would be the rd choice here. They built guns that dont break but fit amp finish wise you get what you pay for. Im not saying its going to fail like a HiPoint or have the ergonics of a brick. They just arent quite the best rifles. The best example here is look at the  Plinkster series versus your Ruger  or look at an old Rem  Wingmaster versus a Mossberg . They work but they arent the best.Remington now Ill be honest I think the LOL FREEDOM GROUP SUCKZ AT LIFE is overblown but it sounds like you got one shot at this. You want to buy one gun that does the job out of the box on Day . In this instance stick with the brands that bring a good reputation. Right now while theres potential for Remington to deliver a great rifle its not a sure thing. If Remington had their shit together Id say go that way but no never again.,guns,d4oo0uq,3,t5_2qhc8

Piston ARs have cleaner bolts so you dont have to clean that as much and its slightly easier to run suppressed if it has a suppressor specific setting you have to replace a part in a DI AR to minimize blowback.

Ive picked up some command strips to hang cleaning rods on the door of the safe.

Doesnt stand up to the same torture tests as an eotech well the average range shooter doesnt need it to and is paying  the cost on that will effectively perform the exact same in their eyes. If it holds zero proves accurate and holds up to the shock of firing then seems like a decent optic to me. Like the guys review says wouldnt go to war with it but its not a bad product for the price.

Getting the code wouldnt be any harder than card numbers a la the Target breach but since its a onetime code it does nobody any good. In practice I dont know if its been cracked yet but Im sure its only a matter of time. Chip and pin would be better since you can do public key style encryption for it which could probably actually be invulnerable if implemented right and open source!. Some processors use full end to end encryption so no matter what is done with the POS unless the processor Ingencio or Verisign or whoever is compromised the number is secured even on traditional swipe only pads. This would protect against Target style attacks where the store or card issuer hasnt transitioned to chips yet. Its a reasonable middle ground that we should have transitioned to years ago but not as secure as the chip since the processor is still a weak point.,guns,d5oinxf,1,t5_2qhc8

I upgraded the gear box motor and gave it a tight bore barrel while using .g bbs. I was a dedicated sniper and the only weapon that shot more accurately was my buddies upgraded springer sniper. I still remember my favorite shot with it. We played in this abandoned dig site so the floor was about  ft below the ridge and massive with lots of brush because of the rain that collected there. My favorite perches were along the ridge line. I was in one of my usual spots sitting back with a cigar after getting a nice yd kill shot when I hear someone rushing up the hill. I pop up a bit see where they are and go down to ready a paintball grenade. As I pop up again to throw it they see me about to throw the grenade and open up. Unfortunately this round I loaned out my gun because I was playing with the springer rifle and the person coming at me had my gun.

Target frames are  each at the range office and you get that refunded when you turn them in. There are steel targets starting at  yards in  yard increments up to . They have a decent pistolshotgun range on the other side as well. It does get crowded on the weekends so if you plan to go on SatSun show up at  to get a good spot. They open at . If you can I would go during the week. Bring plenty of ammo as their stock is way overpriced. Prices vary depending the daytime you go but they arent too bad. Check their website for more info.As for the desert the closest place I know of is Hodge Road Its about  min past the Bear Valley exit heading north on the  freeway. Its free and open to all kinds of shooting. You have to bring your own targets of course and be sure to bring plenty of snackswater. Please pick up your trash brass included if you go there. Exit Hodge Road and make a left at the stop signcross the freeway and your there. Choose your hill to shoot at. EDIT There is also another place I have been meaning to try out called Wes Thompsons Piru Gun Range Its a bit past Magic Mountain out by Lake Piru. Its a really junky place and kind of small but they have paper from  yards and steel from  and out at  yards. They also have spotting scopes for public use. I only went there once on a Sunday but I got there kinda late and it was WAY to crowded so I ended up leaving. Id like to go back though.EDIT  There is also Oaktree Gun Club but they dont have a single range with targets past  yards.

8569328,0,t3_4x5rdd,gt I know how to shootgt thisll be my first time with live ammo and at a rangeAbandon any preconceptions you may have because you cant learn if you think you already know the material. Shooting involves more than just pointing and pulling the trigger. Like any skill there are certain fundamentals involved and if you skimp on them you will spend x more time trying to erase bad habits and relearning what you shouldve learned the first time. The key things are sight picture sight alignment and trigger control. Sight picture means to focus on the front sight and aligning that with your target keep the front sight in focus while you do this. On a semiautomatic handgun there will be two sights a front postlike sight and a rear sight that is U or notch shaped. Sight alignment means to keep the front sight centered and level with the rear sights. Trigger control means to push the trigger back with firm consistent pressure. I use the word push instead of pull because pull gives the impression that you need to leverage a lot of force against it and if you try to do that you will slap the trigger to the rear and make your shots inconsistent. It also means to follow through with that push so even after the gun recoils continue applying firm consistent pressure and follow through with that push. You wont be an expert shot on your first try so dont try to be. Just get used to operating the gun and shooting with good fundamentals. Wear both ear and eye protection along with a normalhigh collar shirt jeanspants closed toed shoes and a baseball cap. The baseball cap will keep brass off your headface.Remember that to clear the gun you remove the magazine FIRST then rack the slide. Rack it twice just to make sure. All of the gun safety rules apply all of the time. Even if youve just cleared the gun. Even if you are pointing it mostly downrange. The most important rule is to always point it in a safe direction this is the most fundamental safety rule because even if you are irresponsible and fail to uphold the others that rule will keep you safe. The second most fundamental rule is always keep your finger off the trigger until ready to shoot. The other rules are extensions of these rules. If you get hot brass on your hand arm neck or anywhere get the gun onto the counter FIRST then address the brass. It will be very hot like getting burned with the metal surfaces of a lighter thats been on for  seconds but getting shot is far worse. Transfer the gun between shooters by leaving it on the counter space and stepping back. Do not pass it to another shooter behind the firing line even if its grip first and still pointed downrange. ,guns,d6cqwh2,45,t5_2qhc8

8613806,0,t3_4xtld3,There are two safety issues that are in play here. The first as you pointed out is dropsafety and the second is holstering. Lets assume all of our modern pistols are reasonably dropsafe and look at holstering instead.Generally speaking holstering a cocked unlocked singleaction pistol is a little dicey. A slight amount of friction against the side of the trigger while the pistol is being pressed into place can cause a discharge. A pistol with a crisp light trigger offers very little margin for error here.You say your P has a  inch trigger travel before the gun fires which does mitigate this hazard a bit. A typical  has virtually zero weighted movement before the gun fires which does make this sort of carry legitimately unsafe for them. Of course most strikerfired guns generally have a longer trigger pull some of it weighted and many have that cute little blade safety too.Theres no distinct cutoff between safe and unsafe here its a sliding scale. The more trigger motion and the more weight required to move the trigger will rapidly decrease the hazard to the point where most people can stop worrying about it.Ill add that an accident of this type can be especially severe. A tunneling leg wound through the thigh can cause severe bleeding that is very difficult to control. Plugging the holes on each end of the tunnel is not enough the blood will simply pool in the spaces between the muscles. It can be impossible to apply enough external pressure to stop the bleeding deep inside the tunnel and the result is predictable. You really dont want that kind of wound.,guns,d6ibn3x,22,t5_2qhc8

I just hope it all goes smoothly. As long as they dont try to take them away from me I have real sympathy for people who arent comfortable with guns. The Second Amendment doesnt require that people like guns or that I dislike people who dont like them. Id feel badly if this made people feel uncomfortable at school the same as Id feel badly for someone whos uncomfortable because someone was exercising their First Amendment rights.It wouldve been better if the professors hadnt sued  very few people would have noticed this happening. Campus carry is obviously constitutional I just think it harms everyone when people feel like guns are being forced upon them. To a certain extent its unavoidable when Second Amendment rights are in danger.I also think one of the dangers to the Second Amendment is the disconnect between the fact that some people think Im going to hurt them and I know that Im not. The more we can be cool to people who think guns are automatically going to hurt them without screaming SHALL NOT BE INFRINGED in their faces the better our chances at understanding each other. We both know that perception of us is unfair but we also both know there are gun owners who do it.Ill support the right to carry no matter what but the right to carry would be in less danger if everyone was cool with each other.

If we legislated away things people enjoyed because they didnt need them fast cars recreational drugs like alcohol and cigarettes  ply toilet paper etc would all be illegal. So unless you can give a good reason beyond lack of need Id encourage you to not advocate for stripping away more rights. But just to address your concern anyway for the sake of arguement a short barrel rifle with a suppressor is an ideal home defense weapon a more courteous range gun for those around you that is also easier to transport pretty fun to shoot with take up less space in a safe than a longer rifle and the list goes on and on. ,guns,d6lk57h,3,t5_2qhc8

I dont have any data on this but it seems like the guns removed from circulation have a lot probability of used in a crime andor murder.

The rollerdelay action is cool and really reduces felt recoil but the plastic body feels cheap and the sights and trigger are mediocre at best. For  youre paying mostly for novelty and uniqueness.Since the company is still around and selling replacement parts you have a contingency in case the gun is a lemon for whatever reason so really your question should be whether you have  to blow on a mm PCC that doesnt excel at anything besides holding and shooting a shitton of rounds at a time.Let me know if you have any specific questions.

There are games that use birdshot spread for a shotgun thats supposed to be shooting  buck for balancing purposes. There are games that significantly updowngrade the effectiveness of a rifle based on only  of barrel length at ranges under  yards.

Once to exceed the yield strength pressure at which the metal deforms but does not return to its original shape of the metal the permanently deformed area is now stronger than the nondeformed area around it. So you start putting pressure on the part and if you dont apply the pressure in a manner that restricts movement to only the section that you want to move the weaker area next to it will deform instead.Take a paperclip and try to straighten it out. You will end up with a wavy wire. The section of the wire deformed during manufacturing is stronger than the wire next to it.It may be fixable but without seeing the part and the amount of movement or knowing your abilities my best advice is to buy a stripped upper and vise block.,guns,d7pko1f,6,t5_2qhc8

8975141,0,t1_d7qi2h2,Id actually suggest a handgun for that purpose mainly because a rifle would take up space that could be used for a larger backpack to store more books and would make more noise. It wouldnt be optimal but if theyre trying to avoid combat and treat the gun as a last resort theyd probably prefer a sidearm than a dedicated long arm. Based on your story I would probably opt for a GI spec  which is a  . ACP handgun. It doesnt hold a lot of rounds but that would reinforce the resource scarce atmosphere and let you set up some tense scenes when they do get involved in a shootout. Midrange for a firearm is around  yards based on the average range of modern urban combat which the  isnt going to be capable of but it will be capable of making a  yard shot if the shooter is capable enough which your veteran character could be. Like all pistols the  would be defensive in nature and would only be useful in an offensive role if you close distance. Due its limited capacity you would want to only use a few shots at a time and try to swap magazines with more loaded ones when possible. A  magazine is singlestack which means that it stacks the rounds in a singlefile vertical line this makes it thin about the width of an average folding knife including the clip and about as long as it. You could stuff two into a standard pant pocket with reasonable comfort. . ACP recoils more than mm so those shots would be taken more deliberately since you have to use better technique to shoot it accurately. It doesnt scream dont mess with me the same way an AA would but it fits your narrative better and if used effectively can be just as if not more scarier  than someone wielding an exotic piece that they arent necessarily effective with. ,guns,d7qoci4,1,t5_2qhc8

I am slowly building up my WW Austrian firearms collection and had been eyeing off  Ms at my LGS for a while.. then after a bit more looking I saw they actually had  short variants so I caved as I usually do on my LGS visits and had to buy . In the Gallery Ive included pics of both and I went for the lighter coloured  as it seems in better condition.I am still learning about these and will be using this example I bought as a research pieceetc. As such I am looking for infohelp on identifying the markingsetc on this firearm.From what I have researched so far it appears to be a Steyr  Stutzen M made in Steyr and used by the Austrian side of the Austrohungarians Has the imperial Eagle stamp. The serial number matches on the stock and the receiver although stock has multiple numbers? refurbedrefitted?. It was labeled as being in x which from what I see matches with what Ms can be.But now Im sort of stuck on more info.

Nothing worse than taking a nice trip to an outdoor range with everything only to find out that range uses target stands requiring a stapler of some kind but does not have staplers lying around. Also if you ever get to go shooting on someones land you can affix your targets to pretty much anything. I personally keep old political signs in my trunk to use as target stands.

Theyre not even comparatively cheap anymore what with offerings from Walther HK Smith et al. pushing in at their price point.

9145504,0,t3_55izer,I wouldnt necessarily say that nationally is the right level of inquiry. Company would probably be more appropriate. And it depends on the design and type of fire arm. Sometimes companies specialize by country.But generally speaking American companies on the whole make the best average consumer grade firearms. We have the largest market the most manufacturersand our guns end up all over the world for a reason.  But the Italians make better consumer grade hunting shotguns than we do. The Swiss and Germans make higher quality military arms always have. If this was the s Id say Belgium hands down when we still imported browning designed firearms from them. But nowadays FN herstal mostly just makes innovative military guns of midrate quality though they have traditionally produced many firearms for the US military. When it comes to high end custom guns its hard to beat HampH and Purdey in England and Mauser in germany. But thats a product of money and time invested.

In fact at the time of the bible being written there were no guns so the discussion must be more in the generic form of protecting yourself with a generic weapon.Proverbs  Deliver those who are drawn toward death And hold back those stumbling to the slaughter. by many is interpreted as it is acceptable to protect yourself and others from danger.Now some point to Exodus    You shall not murder. and use that as an argument against guns. But murder is the premeditated killing of another is wrong but protecting yourself and your family that might create a death of the assailant is not murder. So lets look at Exodus    If the thief is found breaking in and he is struck so that he dies there shall be no guilt for his bloodshed.    If the sun has risen on him there shall be guilt for his bloodshed.This states it is acceptable to defend ones own person or family. But what does the if the sun has risen on him mean? That means if you can clearly see the intent and the person is not a physical danger and only wants to steal property it is not acceptable to kill. However if they threaten you or the family it is acceptable to defend yourself.Or lets look at two Psalm readingsPsalm  Blessed be the LORD my strength which teacheth my hands to war and my fingers to fightPsalm  He teaches my hands to make war So that my arms can bend a bow of bronzeBoth are saying it is proper to be skilled in the use of weapons and if skilled and reasonable in their use to protect life is acceptable.No reason to get deeply in the bible any further but just to state the bible does not tell a person they are not allowed to protect themselves from danger or those wishing to do harm. BUT on the other hand stress the importance of being skilled in the use of a firearm. Buying a gun putting in a drawer and not training is very dangerous and may not be able to protect you and your family.Discuss with your wife the desire to get a small pistol to be used for protection and get an easy access safe for it. I would start out with a . that is not loud and will not scare your wife. Then go to the range several times. Then maybe rent a mm or borrow a friends . and shoot those at the range with the wife. They have a little more kick but manageable. Get your wife used to the effects and that they make noise.Most people who do not shoot guns have a fear but is not the fear of the gun but the fear of the unknown. Become aware and the gun is no longer scary. I have been carrying concealed for about a decade and now a gun in my pocket feels no different than a set of keys or wallet in my back pocket. Not suggesting carrying yet but only making the comment that after a while it feels natural and that will help eliminate the fear that your wife may have.,guns,d8dpxld,6,t5_2qhc8

I have little interest in keeping a burgler from getting them if he can get past my dead bolt security door with alarm with large visible camera overlooking entry and dead bolt front door or get through my double paned closed blind windows  not to mention past the no solicitor and beware of dog signs clearly posted.

9183082,0,t1_d8fsrdz,Oh boy.  A shotgun needs to be aimed as much as a rifle or pistol at HD distances.  Choke doesnt even make that much different at these ranges.  If you are woken up from a deep sleep and you take a shot at another person in your home you better be able to clearly identify your target. And it it is dark you have to have a light.  No light you arent going to see targets no matter what gun youre using.   If your sight geometry  isnt there then a shotgun isnt an advantage.  As far as If you have a rifle you might have a red dot that would be the best option goes you could put one on a shotgun too.  Shotguns are generally easier to learn and to hit something with even for novice shooters.  I cant tell by this comment if you have never shot an AR or if you have never shot a shotgun or if you have never shot either but that couldnt be further from the truth.  ,guns,d8g0udi,0,t5_2qhc8

To this day my mom brings up that old Stingray and how crushed she is she couldnt afford it for me. I always have to remind her that she made the right choice by choosing to feed me over buying a bicycle and I remind her that I shoulda had my own  for the bike. So youll probably feel like my mother. With a life time of regret no matter whoever tells you its okay. But do you wanna think about that all the time?

9313473,0,t1_d8wi7bl,...Okay?You can design a . ACP submachine gun that has higher RPM easily the KRISS Vector has  RPM versus the  RPM of the P. Cyclic rate is not mechanically limited by cartridge you can make a gun chambered in an appropriate caliber have high cyclic rates too.The Vz  was chambered in weaker rounds but it still had up to  RPM just like the P.The reason why the Thompson fired slower  RPM is because the recoil is more controllable at slower cyclic rates. . ACP does not recoil more than . but it DOES recoil more than mm which means that its less controllable at high RPM. The Thompson fires slower to make it more controllable it still wasnt easy to control because the design is awkward and unergonomic but that has to do with the Thompsons specific design and not . ACP specifically. The HampK UMP is considered a lot easier to control because its a more ergonomic gun even though the actual recoil force per shot is the same or greater due to its lighter weight cyclic rate is still kept low and its actually slower than the Thompson at  RPM. ,guns,d8wjuvg,1,t5_2qhc8

Theyre much more expensive to make super precise due to there being many more moving parts. There are no levergat designs with ultra stiff actions like there are bolt rifles.. There arent any major advantage to using levergat over a bolt gun.. Combination of   and  means nobody is accurizing them and nobody is making ultra accurate barrels for them.Someone else made a point about locktime that was pretty reasonable but theres nothing stopping you from making a levergat striker gun like most bolt actions are.

Mg are often used for suppressive fire but a modern western medium machine gun with a qualified gunner is capable of highly accurate sustained fire. Especially when firing from a bipod or tripod. A  cal is easily accurate enough to engage troops in the open a mile away. With iron sights. I expect a qualified gunner to be on target at that range on his second  round burst from a tripod. Its that easy. Is it that easy out of a moving vehicle off a pintle mount?  No. Of course not. When lets say for instance a platoon of joes come under small arms fire from m away the best tool to deal with that threat is not their m.

Talking to the sheriff is a good idea but you should write an email to the sheriffs department outlining your situation and to request a meeting instead of just showing up one day. Everything these days comes down to documentation so having an email chain with your side of the story in it will serve you better than simply saying I talked to the sheriff about it if you plan to take legal action down the road. I would also suggest investing in a surveillance camera so you can catch him in the act of trespassing or whatever else he may do and pressing charges against him whenever possible regardless of what the rest of your family thinks. Eventually you may qualify for a restraining order which should open him up to criminal charges if he chooses to continue to harass you. ,guns,d9e5xl9,1,t5_2qhc8

9481309,0,t1_d9g9fro,I know how that feels.  Luckily I moved out of Connecticut and moved around a bit. Even when I was technically antiA  I always was fascinated by guns.  My grandparents were both WW vets so in the back of my head I realized that Europe wasnt liberated with flowers and fucking handshakes but I bought into the line that only cops and military etc etc etc. I always wanted to try shooting though and one day I just said fuck it got a friend to go with me to a rental range and really loved it. I learned how methodical people are when it comes to gun safety and how well designed most modern firearms are when it comes to safety.  Bought a bolt action rifle back in Seattle and never heard the end of it from my parents and friends.  They told me to sell it over and over and finally promised to reimburse me for anything I lost over the sale. I said fine Ill do it but Im going to use the money to get another gun after I move so I now I own pic related At this point my parents have come around to the idea that I want to do this and am not going to cave in some of my friends are still weirded out by it. Id say tell your parents over the phone. let them freak out stay calm but stand your ground.  Tell them youll keep it safe and locked away but be firm that you are proA.  Obviously Im not telling my parents that Ive spent close to  dollars on ammo this month or that I plan on getting another handgun by Christmas because I like this one for its historical value too much to ever want to use it in a HD situation god forbid or that I plan on CCing but let them know that you own a gun and that theres nothing they can do about it. ,guns,d9hry1g,2,t5_2qhc8

9484137,0,t1_d9i3s6d,gt Please consider the possibility that maybe youre being fed progun propaganda.That article is behind a pay wall and I never said the industry didnt provide funds to the NRA. They are still not an industry lobby however that is the NSSF. They get some money from retailers that ask their patrons to donate and the manufactures give small amount of fees but that doesnt mean they are an industry lobby. Regardless the gun industry has always been beholden to the consumers and its one of the few industries that is.gtOr for this matter that maybe were both misinformed with propaganda from each side.I am not misinformed I just dont think donations imply control especially not with an organization  million strong.gtThey still fund political campaigns even if thats only a minor influence its still there.So?gtI mean whats the point with say highcapacity magazines? No gun owner really needs those for exampleYou are obviously clueless on how selfdefense works which makes sense judging by your spelling. Most crimes involve multiple attackers so you need more than one round. Guns arent death rays and require multiple hits just to stop one person. Factor in that even a  hit percentage is considered high in a combat scenario and now you know why people want as much ammo as possible. Factor in that making them illegal is not going to save lives and you can now see why people fight so hard against their restriction. gtyet the NRA would be happy if they were legal as far as Ive heard.They are legal and I am happy with that. Just because the NRA wants something doesnt mean other people didnt want that anyway. Also if the NRA truly represented the industry they would support magazine restriction. Then people would need to buy more magazines so they can keep more ammo at the ready. See why your argument makes no sense.gtI consider democracy as a lesser evil compared with any other form of government. However I still wish that politicians were better and that voters werent that stupid.How open minded of you to think people who are progun are stupid. Maybe nothing that Hillary has offered even benefits them so they see her as a straight negative.gt Theres absolutely no reason to think that gun manufacturers wouldnt try to tip the balance in their favour but also theres no reason to think that millions of NRA supporters wouldnt have an influence in politics.The gun industry is beholden to the customers. The customers want the things Hillary wants to make illegal.

Its also been done with rockets and mortar rounds in a way that caused them to detonate at the moment they were fired instead of on impact. The problem with this is that you have to have someone to place the ammo in an already existing stockpile thats probably in enemy hands and thats way easier said than done.

9620877,0,t3_5cowja,Barrel break in is a myth. Before you shoot it familiarize yourself with the manual field strip it inspect the bore and gun for manufacturing debris or excess storage grease and clean it. When you hit the range shoot a couple hundred rounds through it on your first range trip and enjoy yourself while your doing it. Any immediate problems with manufacturing or parts will show itself within  rounds. Use quality factory ammo not reloads. When you get home field strip it and clean it. It doesnt have to be spotless. Inspect for any heavy gouging or noticably heavy wear. Pistol slide rails and barrel hoods will show a small amount of finish wear after  rounds. If they have a LOT then something might be out of spec. Put it back together. Oil it. Put it in a safe place for storage. Done. ,guns,d9yyyva,1,t5_2qhc8

Either open or concealed carryYes concealed most of the time but I open carry on private propertyland. gtIf so why do you feel the need to carry a gun in modern day society?I grew up in Europe much like yourself fuck the EU though and I did not believe that owning a gun was a right. I also believed that carrying a gun was unnecessary and it would escalate acts of violence. Growing up where I did I was a minority religiousethnicity and I had suffered multiple violent attacks. The worst one I ever experienced involved being beaten by multiple attackers then knocked to the floor and kicked and stomped on. I thought I was going to die and to be honest had they kept kicking my head I might have. After I called the police they took  minutes to show up and told me I could be cited for fighting in a public area I had not thrown a single punch. For years I had taken martial arts and I do some BJJ still but against multiple attackers it is absolutely fucking worthless. The reality of the situation is that a firearm is an equalizer for violent attacks which do happen and unfortunately have occurred to me before.  gtFavourite gun?I like Kalashnikovs. I love them all as long as they are made by a reputable factorybuilder. Fuck IO and Century Arms.gtViews on gun crime as a wholeA lot of the gun crime in the US is due to the fucked up criminal justice system mixed with crappy federal adventures War on Drugs and other socialpolitical issues which are unresolved. Comparing the US to other countries in the NorthSouth American continent shows how low the overall murder rate is compared to its neighbors. Furthermore forget about the buzz term gun crime and look at overall murder and violent crime.  i.e. Thats great that Russia for the most part banned handguns for civilians what a shame it has a higher murder rate than the US. gtDo you own guns for a very specific reason that isnt self defence? i.e. Home Defence Like the mechanical aspect fun to shoot and so onAll of my guns can be used for self defence. They can also be used for competition hunting recreational etc. The user decides what they chose to use the firearm.

While I have a lot of faith in my red dots after all I run a Burris on my competition Glock I wouldnt want to pull out my concealed carry handgun and find out that the battery is dead or turned off if I didnt have some sort of backup. You will need suppressor height sights to be usable when you have an RDS mounted. My FFIII sticks up another  or so above the stock sights so theres no way Id be able to use them. You might run into some problems if you want an absolute cowitness with your red dot because of the varying heights in both iron sights and red dots. For example standard suppressor sights may not quite cowitness perfectly with a Burris but they might work with a Trijicon RMR. Dawsons MOS sights may cowitness perfectly with a Leupold Deltapoint but not with a Docter. So on and so forth. Id just grab a set of the Dawson MOS sights for now and practice with the setup once you get your red dot. ,guns,dafu3q2,1,t5_2qhc8

9879896,0,t1_davbp28,Itd be more economical to just buy the real thing.The reason you dont really see accurate replicas or inert firearms in the US is because of what it takes to make something like that that isnt legally a firearm. Legislators ran into a problem a long time ago when they had to decide what exactly a gun legally is. I mean if you take a gun apart at what point is it no longer a gun? And they certainly didnt want people to be able to transfer disassembled complete guns as if they werent legally guns. So they decided to regulate the receiver as the whole gun. Its the part that basically holds the whole rifle together and the way to deactivate or demill the receiver is to torch cut it like this If that part wasnt cut itd legally be a restricted machine gun.You cant just give some plans of a gun to a random machinist because hed then be manufacturing a firearm as part of his business and without the appropriate Federal Firearms License thats a crime. Long story short buy the real thing or an airsoft gun which would be far less accurate. And if you decided to get an FFL to do machining for the high price theyd charge dont do the PSG. PSG receivers have to be made in a different way that involves bending a flat around a jig and its a much harder thing for your standard machine shop to accomplish without the appropriate jig. That being said however you can build your own working PSG if youre willing to buy all the parts and put time and effort into it. Heres some parts,guns,davdgmd,7,t5_2qhc8

9943792,0,t1_db3ntxi,Murder is illegal because there are laws against it. Just about anyone would agree that murder is wrong and violates natural rights but its not illegal until someone writes a law describing under what conditions murder is illegal and how it will be punished. If there is no law prohibiting or allowing slavery what are you going to charge the slaveholder with? You cant imprison someone for violating natural rights if they havent actually committed a crime. I could understand an argument that humans cannot be considered property without an affirmative law and while that could effectively end slavery by giving the government the ability to rescue slaves without infringing on property rights which the constitution prohibits anyway by stipulating the return of escaped slaves the effective impossibility of holding slaves as property is not the same as slavery being illegal.The constitution does not contain any provision that makes it illegal for individuals to violate each others natural rights nor does it define natural rights for such purposes or delegate the authority to do so to Congress. The police cannot arrest someone and send them to court with a charge of violating natural rights. The federal government is slowly inching that way ever since the civil rights movement the Heart of Atlanta Motel case for example but even then only with regard to business and on the basis of the commerce clause.I agree that the bill of rights unnecessarily not so in retrospect enumerated things the federal government already did not have the authority to legislate on but this is because the federal government is defined to have limited powers. The first amendment was unnecessary because the constitution never delegates the power to regulate speech to the federal government.,guns,db3p84o,2,t5_2qhc8

Yeah my dad built it when I had moved out for school yeah he and I as well loves the idea of me being able to defend myself and my home but he had also noticed I was a bit sad at the range being limited to the rifles which I can only shoot from prone and pistols while everyone else got to obliterate the crap out of pumpkins and clays with shotguns. I cant shoot a traditional shotgun from the shoulder more than a couple times without being in a lot of pain  theyre a lot of fun and I was really missing out.

9959836,0,t1_db0y1pq,gt You OWN every shot you send down range the idea of not aiming is ABSURD. In SD yes. But this is Israeli military style. In combat first one to fire usually win the fight. The idea expresses that in the form of point shooting for the first few rounds followed by aiming down the sight. Not all the shots will be point shooting and random spraying. gt Look at all the wasted movement that is going on by bringing the arms up to your face not to mention the reloads. One of the most important concept of shooting is muscle memory. The idea of shooting without actively thinking about it. This is important in combat and SD situations where fears stresses and adrenaline greatly affect your normal shooting style. To everybody else those moves seem exaggerated and impractical. However they were designed with a purpose in mind muscle memory. This video does it in slow motion where all the movements are more exaggerated than normal for demonstration purposes. You should watch the actually combat training version. It is much faster and more fluid motion. Like all else if you do it enough time you become amazingly fast and good at it. gtIf you not going to fucking aim just shoot from the hip Hollywood cowboy style and save yourself the trouble.That is the fastest style but not accurate. You must have some assumption that point shooting is completely random and has no accuracy. Not true. The point of point shooting is gain the fastest speed while maintain an acceptable level of accuracy. It is actually a form of partial aiming where some accuracy is tradeoff for faster speed. In the end it is one of many style of shooting. Not necessarily the best in my opinion. For example they just isosceles stance. This stance is often trained by military and police because they are wearing body armors. It is also the most accurate shooting stance. For civilians a fighter stance or even weaver stance is better.  ,guns,db5sjg2,0,t5_2qhc8

I didnt know how Id feel about it at first but the more I look at it and handle it the more I like it. Dat sight radius doe.  Manticores transformer panels are pretty handy. I have the frag panels it came with on the sides and a keymod panel on the bottom for the Sig handstopgrip.  Fit and finish on it are pretty good. Easy to install once I got the OEM barrel nut off luckily mine didnt have a lifetime supply of loctite on it so it wasnt too bad.

10046090,0,t3_5jl4ue,I would advise against a big old military rifle for a first gun. They have a lot of recoil and it isnt easy to find ammo for a good price. Of them all a mosin is easiest to get ammo for. I went with a yugoslavian mauser for my first full size rifle and a I kinda regret it. I should have saved up for a nice handgun or something along the lines of a mini or a decent shotgun. I do like my mauser a lot but Ive gotten much less use out of it than I could have from a more modern available and moderate cartridge. If youve never owned a gun of any kind Id recommend something chambered in lr. Marlin model s are nice ruger s are a good rifle. Vintage Remingtons were great Id avoid the newer ones from  or so. Its a pretty broad market with lots of good options.  can buy you a very nice brand new   can get you a nice used one.As far as shotguns it depends on the application. HD only shotgun sports like trap or skeet cowboy competitions hunting. Theres a lot a shotgun can do but they tend to have different barrels and stocks that are better at specific things. Knowing specifically and realistically what you plan to do with it makes a big difference so does budget. What makes a good HD shotgun does not make a good hunting gun but you can get a good compromise or a spare barrel. If youre getting into skeet or trap hardcore you might want something else entirely. s are nice pistol. Lots of manufacturers and options. I kinda prefer the mm chambered ones since theyre more fun. Springfield makes a decent ones for a reasonable price rock island probably has the lowest price for a a workable GI style gun.

Working with an  Springfield trapdoor rifle the studio prop houses had plenty of those they simply had a dummy brass with a dull finish flintlock lock and strike plate assembly cast then fitted it via the lock screws over the original Springfield hammer and lockplate... With one of these guns actors used . caliber blank cartridges which could be quickly inserted into the breech by simply lifting the hinged breechblock of the Springfield...gt The studios also saved time by not having to train each and every actor how to safely and efficiently load and fire a flintlock arm. The weapon was prone to frequent misfires when the user did not properly flint or take care of it. This writer has served as a gun coach for stars like Charlton Heston s The Mountain Men Mel Gibson and Heath Ledger s The Patriot teaching them the proper handling techniques of flintlock muskets pistols and riflesand I can attest that it does take time to train actors.IMFDB has a picture of a fulllength version from The Alamo.  ,guns,dbi85bi,3,t5_2qhc8

They can be very quiet from nonsuppressed rifles but lack the power to cycle most actions and the small case size can cause feeding issues for many guns. In terms of legal status they are not considered silenced ammunition like captive piston rounds as they are essentially a neutered standard round instead of something specifically designed to avoid a loud report when fired.The . CB Caps are legally available online and at many big box stores. Bullshit Rating Moderate  This is a somewhat obscure cartridge that rivals subsonic rounds through a silencer for quietness when used in a rifle.

Youre being a total hypocrite.  Pure logic proves God exists though. Wrong. It proves the idea of God exists which is completely different obviously.Are you trying to suggest that reason and logic have no sway over reality? Youre actually so desperate that youre denying reason itself.

10207393,0,t1_dc0zf0s,gtDesigned in  or thereabouts in the Czech Republic which was known then as Czechoslovakia the CZ pistol was intended from the beginning as an export item to sell to the West. As such it was chambered for the NATO standard  cartridge. Then as so often happens politics reared its ugly head and the design was considered so good that it was given a secret patent and export to the West was forbidden. This secret status prevented patenting it in Western nations and when a few of the pistols made their way into Western Europe and even finally to the USA the design was quickly appreciated and even cloned by other gun manufacturers creating a large market for a gun that was essentially impossible to buy. This situation ended with the breakup of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact. CZ was able to sell their pistols worldwide often competing with clones of themselves.    ,guns,dc12ch8,1,t5_2qhc8

The little square emblem on the grips give away the brand and that holds true for many similar revolvers.  It was a Very commonly copied design. These were generally priced and built for a working mans budget.  I cant make out the type of cartridge but it should be stamped somewhere on the barrel. Probably a  SampW short or a  SampW. Not to be confused with  special. Depending on the age of the gun it may not be safe to use smokeless powder but I dont know specifically. Its advisable to remove those cartridges. If you lift upwards on the rear sight the textured metal studs on either side on top of the gun it will release it and allow the barrel and cylinder to pivot forward. Then the casings can be removed. ,guns,dc9u68r,4,t5_2qhc8

According to the Colt serial number database link you posted it is a  MODEL  MILITARY.    I am not a gun guy at all so dont shoot me but I did take it to a fairly large gun shop and shooting range place to have it cleaned not harshly mostly just oiled for preservation and the gunsmith there just about freaked over it because he knew it was a fairly early example due to the serial number and something about it didnt have a thumbnotch.  Also the patina on the gun is sorta green and he said that was unusual.  Cool story bro time...  When I was a little kid like  years old my grandfather would coach me about if anything ever happened to him then I was to go retrieve this gun from the footlocker in his bedroom and make sure my uncle didnt get it.  This was because my grandfather also brought back some Korean or Chinese? rifles from his stint in the Korean conflict which he gave to my uncle but my uncle traded them for some other guns and my grandfather never forgave him haha.  ,guns,dcg2s37,14,t5_2qhc8

10364790,0,t3_5ofcvy,Used guns rarely come with warranties and sometimes have unexpected problems. Some gun shops dont do a thorough check of all guns they buy since they go through so much volume and will often have some disclaimer about not having certified that the firearm is in usable condition.That said used guns are cheaper and cheaper is good. If you see a used gun you like check it over as completely as possible. Many gun owners take care of their shit so theres not too high a risk of you buying a gat and it being all rusted to hell. Even then a little bit of surface rust in certain areas of the gun isnt too big a problem and can usually be scrubbed with a bit of elbow grease.In some cases buying a gun used is a necessity. Many great guns just arent produced anymore so youre just not gonna find an unused one. And in some cases old guns are better. For instance Remingtons and Marlins produced before those companies were aquired by Freedom Group tend to be of higher quality.Most importantly do your research. If theres a certain gun you want learn what to look for on a preowned one. Its really not too different than buying a car.,guns,dciwszc,3,t5_2qhc8

10424279,0,t1_dcpmuwe,TNT synthesis is a very different animal since the nitration step involves toluene which is methylbenzene. The methyl group encourages the adjacent pi bond to break in favor of addition of a nitronium ion. This makes the rate of nitrate addition to toluene extremely fastmuch faster than addition to benzene and other aromatics.Cellulose is a highly substituted polymer so theres a lot of hindrance on its rings. Thats why the nitronium goes after the outlying hydroxyl groups. Theres not really anywhere else for it to go so runaway heat isnt nearly as much of a worry in cellulose nitration. A simple ice bath and standard acid mixing procedure is more than adequate to do it safely.Of course OP still shouldnt try it. Making explosives is risky business even if the reaction is relatively safe. I made some nitrogen triiodide once and luckily decided to keep it under ammonia. Simply picking up the vial would cause bubbles to come off of the precipitate in the bottom...its the most shocksensitive explosive out there.,guns,dcpnt2x,3,t5_2qhc8

It does not matter how complex whatever junk you put on the end of your gun ease of removal has nothing to do with the fact that it is not the muzzle of the barrel. Even if it takes literally  hours to detach the device you have on the forend of your firearm it is not the muzzle.

Democrats are in fullon oppose Trump and rally against him mode right now and calling for doom and gloom and all of that. Thats getting them support now but a lot of people will be tired of it by  if the country hasnt actually fallen apart and Trump hasnt turned out to be literally Hitler. People who arent diehard Democrats might be tired of seeing everything being exaggerated and people protesting every single thing that Trump does for four years straight too. That would especially be true if it turns out that in four years things arent actually that bad. Although if they are bad then that would definitely be a boost for Clinton.Theres also the fact that if Clinton runs in  then that means that she ran in  and lost the primary ran in  and lost the general and is then running in  against the exact person who beat her in . People will be getting tired of that by  if they arent already. And if someone like Bernie were to run against her in the primary and then get treated in a similar way as Bernie then that would really do it for a lot of people.So lots of rampant speculating and she might win but people are definitely going to be tired of her by . Really the deciding factor will probably be if things are good under President Trump in  and Democrats who oppose him are seen as being bitter and whiny and still clinging to Hillary after  years or if things are bad under President Trump in  and the Democrats who oppose him are seen as being correct.,guns,dd3y0zw,2,t5_2qhc8

10624145,0,t3_5s1iv0,The shotgun has a lot going for it. Yes it has draw backs that should be considered and might not be tolerable for some people. Everything has drawbacks. Shotguns are not ideal. But less than ideal is not even in the same category as doesnt get the job done effectively  . Cheaper than pretty much anything. You cant even buy a decent pistol for the cost of a nice pump shotgun.. Versatile. If you play your cards right you can use the same shotgun for just about anything with minimal additional parts and still have spent less money than an AR. Shotgun sports a wide variety of hunting and self defense. Why own  guns when  does what you need it to? . Theres a reason the pump shotgun has been on the battle field virtually unchanged in the same role for over  years. It kills people. The only other weapons with similar staying power is the hand grenade and the mm browning machine gun. . A slug is a  oz. lead testicle moving at the speed of sound. Buckshot is the same as mag dumping a  acpmm luger every time you pull the trigger. In terms of the amount of lead getting thrown at a target in the amount of time not much comes close outside of submachine guns.,guns,ddbssp1,1,t5_2qhc8

Also as someone already mentioned winding it can be a pain too.Stock and cheek weld are fairly uncomfortable and the felt recoil is on the high side.

You dont want the slug trying to be squeezed through too small of a hole when its pushing fps.If you have a smoothbore this is independent of choke restriction shotgun you need to use rifled slugs. These have little concentric fins which will impart spin on the slug and as a result give you better accuracy. Dont use sabot slugs as these are meant to be shot out of a rifled barrel and will give you poor accuracy.

With that said what I always say about the low number Ms isnt that they are safe or unsafe its that there are SAFER options available to shoot. An unknown number of them had a manufacturing problem but I suspect most of the really bad ones already blown up by now. You also have to understand that the problem was partially the fault of poor quality ammo during WWI and the soldiers had a tendency to grease the bullets. You also dont have those shitty  Frankfort Arsenal tin plated bullets that welded themselves to the cases through galvanic action. Youll have none of those problems shooting them now which only leaves the spotting manufacturing to be an issue up to debate now.To be brief its all up to you. If it were up to me and I wanted a collection of Ms Id put it aside and shoot a higher number.That problem isnt heat treatment either as its often been reported. The problem came about during forging. Hatcher accurately described the problem yet used the wrong terminology. I also have a suspicion that even the Army brass didnt actually have a clue at what was going on hence the change in heat treatment techniques too.,guns,ddmw99r,6,t5_2qhc8

A number of places say no louder than  dB but are no more specific than that. From my research so far suppressed . pistols are  dB and suppressed mm pistols are  dB. The Maxim  is reported to be  dB. My notparticularlyeducated guess is that the Maxim  is safe without hearing protection for only a few rounds at a time.Unsuppressed . and mm are about  dB which is similar to a  gauge shotgun.,guns,dedso3s,1,t5_2qhc8

One summer I volunteered at an outdoor range in a rural part of Wisconsin so mostly I would see a few hunter types a few appleseed people and some ar shooters and some concealed carry types.   Which is pretty normal. This story happened shortly after Chris Kyle was killed so it should make more sense. The riflepistol range was a walk up hill from the club house and it was a wooded area.  On my right I see two hooded men with ak pistols at the low ready.  I had already called a cease fire and everyone was standing behind their lanes. The two hooded idiots started yelling choppers in the house mother fucker get ready.   Safe to say they had me and the other RO at the low ready with our rifles and half the range with theirs.  The two hoods turned the fuck around and got out of dodge. I radioed the club house and one of the patrons was an off duty cop he arrested both of them on weapon charges for being felons with firearms and drug items. My second story is I was getting off work and a coworker wanted to show me his new sig p of which I convinced him on. I unloaded my  and gave it the pinky prostate exam in the chamber and handed it to him as I checked his sig. He was sitting in his truck and I was standing at the door. He hands me my  back I then sat there in horror as I saw him put a mag in rack it and pull the trigger within a few seconds. He put a round within  inches of my chest into his truck door that ended up right into the pavement next to my feet. I ended up snatching the pistol out of his hands and cleared it.   He sat there mumbling about something as I checked myself for injuries as I grabbed my trama kit from my trunk. We ended up being OK besides his trick door being fucked up in the company parking lot. Safe to say I dont talk to him anymore.  He blamed the gun for the accident and sold it and got a pistol with a manual safety. ,guns,desn0a5,65,t5_2qhc8

He came out and showed me what the insides look like and indeed the metal was thin and had small air bubbles in it.  He felt bad for breaking them so they put trigicon night sights on it for free.  Didnt even charge me for the install.  They are great and should be for the price.  If you really want these for an EDC gun that your life might depend on spend the money on the better higher quality sights.  If you want subpar night sights to have night sights go with the cheaper option but dont be surprised if they shatter on installation.  Just my cents.,guns,df9gr0b,1,t5_2qhc8

11319408,0,t3_61fujp,I like a  inch barrel it does everything pretty well. Break actions can comfortably have longer barrels since the action doesnt take up as much length as they do for autos and pump actions.  Anything longer than that is kinda unwieldy and its hard to get on target fast in my opinion. Some waterfowl hunters swear by it but I have absolutely not a shred of interest in duck or goose hunting. When it comes to shotgun hunting the choke is more important than the barrel length. With birds youre essentially trying to decapitate them with a concentrated blast to the head. Various grouse tend to be so small and stupid that Id rather hunt them with a  rimfire if I hunt them at all. For deer you should be using a slug they tend to work best with a cylinderunchoked bore.As small as roe deer and your grouse are you might be happiest with a  gauge. You can run a  and you can certainly get lighter loads for the  if you want.  . tends to be too wimpy and patterns too poorly to be of much use. I dont know what gauges are popular or common in your country but about a  can probably get it done efficiently. Maybe a combination gun would be interesting to you?

Its ugly and in a few cases with the Jframe Airweight revolvers and largecalibre Xframes they have engaged themselves under recoil rendering the guns useless. Note this seems to be isolated to the Jframe Airweights and Xframes because they produce a lot more recoil than the other models and there are only maybe three recorded incidences of this happening with millions of revolvers produced in  years. Its a virtual nonissue but still concerns a lot of people.The lock itself is easy to remove it just leaves you with an equally ugly little hold on the side of the gun.

So the FFL in this case isnt breaking any laws to my knowledge.There is a similar loophole to the handgun roster ban. Want an off roster handgun? Its perfectly legal for you to own it. Just like if someone from out of state moved in with a banned handgun. And its technically not illegal for the FFL to transfer it to you.

Mauser and stumbled across what to me was an unknown rifle the Swedish Mauser M.A little research taught me the following The Swedish Mauser is an improvement of the  Mauser it is a cock on close action something which I had previously only associated with the Lee Enfield action. Swedish Mausers were manufactured by Waffenfabrik Mauser AG in Oberndorf aN in Germany Initially due to the tooling being set up in Sweden and Germany having the means to produce the rifle and in Sweden by Carl Gustafs stads Gevrsfaktori and Husqvarna Vapenfabriks Aktiebolag. All Swedish Mausers were fabricated using a Swedishsupplied high grade tool steel At the Swedes requirement alloyed with nickel copper and vanadium a product than noted for its strength and corrosion resistance. A total of circa  were manufactured in Germany and  were made in Sweden.  m carbines were also made along with  m short rifles Not including conversions.The manufacturing of the Swedish Mausers is nothing short of outstanding. Tooling marks on my rifle are nonexistent. The bolt is incredibly smooth and is a pleasure to cycle.I will allow the pictures to show the rest of the quality.My particular rifle was manufactured in  in Husqvarna and was placed in a box left for  years during which it found its way into an estate cellar for many years before I saw it advertised randomly on a national website along with a scope mount. Part of the evidence for its lack of issue condition is that it has no stock disc and its overall condition. To clarify the scope is a no drill n tap this rifle is staying historical.When I first got the rifle I was a wreck of excitement cutting open the big cardboard box and taking out the packaging to reveal this shining tall Swedish Brunette was an adrenaline rush And hopefully shell be part of my life longer than my Blonde Swedish Ex lol I love shooting this rifle the trigger is amazing for a rifle of its period and allows a shooter to print tight groups without issue. The . calibre makes the rifle something you can shoot all day long with a good shoulder thump  that doesnt become painful in the prone after  rounds. Out of the M with gr it shoots so straight sighted in  inches above point of aim at m puts you dead on at m and requires an  inch holdover for m. I slotted on a HAWKE scope I had knocking around to test the mount then put on a Vortex Crossfire II xx. With its  inches of eye relief however the sight picture past x zoom was completely impractical for anything put shooting with a rest.With Prvi Partisan gr she printed her first  round group ever and threw a beautiful .. inch group at m. We then progressed out to m and slotted a . inch group without trying hard. It is important to note that I am not a particularly great shooter as I have shaky hands and hadnt slept much the night before which made things worse. So a . inch group was stellar to put it simply.Moving on to some hand loads using gr Prvi partisan heads and gr of Vihta Vouri N she happily dropped m group sizes to  inch. I am definitely going to be getting a box of  Sierra Matchkings and already have  Hornady red tips.With these groups in my mind I have purchased a Vortex Crossfire II Scout Scope xx with . inch eye relief.This combo is perfect and I am so excited about trying it out.As a roundup this is the best  I have ever spent of a rifle and mount. All round the calibre allows it to be an allround hard and effective hitter. I have now firmly set my sights on getting the M carbine variant.,guns,dg0b1v6,8,t5_2qhc8

11578351,0,t1_dg89ra9,Im just gonna hop in here and give a few points of clarification.mm subsonic bullets have the potential be quieter because you are producing less gas. Period. Full stop. You can debate gas velocity and conflagration rates of powders till the cows come home but in the end less volume of gas means easier to suppress and slow down said gases.  blackout can also be made relatively cheaply. In fact I load my own  blackout subsonic for the cost of pretty decent deals on mm ammo commercially bought. Roughly  cents a shot. I am also NOT currently casting my own bullets or even shooting bare lead. Palmetto projectiles coated bullets have let me run lead dust free cheap subsonic ammo over W powder without any problems fouling my suppressor. In  shots I have not gained a ounce of weight to the suppressor baffles using those projectiles so they are both safe stable and cheap enough to make loading  blackout subsonics as painless to my wallet as buying mm white box. Anyway point is for the quantity of shooting most people would do those are not huge cost differences.The ability to swap between subsonic fun and quiet in an SBR to .X ballistics with a magazine change and nothing else is pretty great. Thats he niche of the  blackout. I would advocate that over a pistol  caliber SBR if you are going to shoot anything but paper with it. If you are going to compete  just shoot at the range and want a giggle factor of quiet shooting by all means buy a Scorpion or MPX or MP clone and go to town. For anyone interested in more details on the  blackout come join us at rblk,guns,dg8euvd,1,t5_2qhc8

The first system would relocate the tappet block and replace the transfer rod section of the FAL and G with a gas tube.  The second system is literally what the SCAR and M use.  The bolt carrier in an auto loading system requires a certain weight to run properly.  What the designers of the M and Scar did was account for some of that weight with a section of carrier forward of the action to interact with the tappet to save on reciprocating mass.,guns,dgbup64,3,t5_2qhc8

11727821,0,t1_dgp21dq,I agree on the price but it really isnt that bad.What ergonomics suck? Fits me and half the world pretty well.Most AKs come with optic mounts. Mounting optics is EASY. You said on another post assuming the AK has a mount rail? Dude this is very standard.  of them have them and the rest can have them fitted. Besides look at your nagant! The PEQ looks ridiculous. Did your Nagant come with that mount? I am seriously laughing right now.Comparing .x to .x is dumb. Youre comparing apples to oranges. If the . was a mediocre choice for an intermediate caliber than please explain a big portion of the soldiers in NAM who would drop their Ms for AKs. Please. Even to this day you see plenty of soldiers who sling a second rifle an AK on their back. So your opinion is shit on the caliber.AK rifles are mass produced milplus. Its why you do research and when you buy a AK or really any gun unless your stupid and uneducated on what you are buying you take it apart and look at it. Its not to hard to find a good AK.

The rock in motion for the mags sucks The Mosin Nagant was done as a joke and is a poor one. Which is the joke. Thats about  worth of optics PEQ and ACOG on a  rifle. They were there long enough to get the photo. The fact that theres a question at all about the presence or not of a side mount rail is plenty for me I compared .x to .x not .x. But while were on the topic. .x is both a better penetrator and retains energy past  better than either of its Soviet counterparts. Sub  yards sure Id rather have .x if Im not fighting someone wearing hard plates. Past that? Naw dawg. I own A Draco two Century AKs NODAK SPUD receivers fwiw and Saigas in .x .x .x and  gauge.

If your home is being invaded by so many guys that youve run through a  or  round rifle mag and have to make a speed reload in the open IMO youre just fucked and youve probably already been shot to pieces anyway.

Hell maybe they all just have knives and bats and are hiding behind your bulletresistant couch waiting for you to reload before they rush you lol.Running through that many rounds even in a home invasion is absolutely not something that happens all the time. And neither is running around a combat zone all by yourself as far as that goes.You have a point about competition shooting but Id rather have another Marine by my side in a firefight than Jerry Miculek.
