Our purpose is to not only fulfill the established duties of student president and student vice president but also to set a new standard of action and initiative in bettering our campusnot for prospective students and their parents not for a college ranking bureau not even for wouldbe donors or their familiesbut for all who call the University of Tennessee Knoxville home the students the faculty and the workers.

If UT cantdoesnt want to handle staffing the retail locations we could easily outsource the staffing to another company or leave it as Aramark. I dont think it matters who handles staffing at the fast food joints but Aramark has a history of hiring employees that engage in criminal activity.And the SGA isnt the path Im trying to take in order to remove Aramark its the student body. Of course UT wont do a thing if the SGA complains about a multinational bn corporation but if there is sustained protest from the majority of the student body they will not be able to ignore it.,UTK,cpj04gk,-2,t5_2spck
3441924,0,t1_cpkktsp,Id go ahead and apply and transfer those credits in because UT can be very picky when it comes to transfer classes they didnt accept three of mine when the classes were the exact same name as classes UT offers so you can see exactly what you still need to take. The nice thing about transferring credits in is that they dont count towards your GPA. Made all Cs? Doesnt matter UT only counts classes you take AT UT.  Also if youve already applied you can check out your DARS to see an exact breakdown of what your need. As a side note invest in some nice Muck Boots!

Specifically the HOPE Scholarship which will give you less because it prorates based on hours unless you are full time and many other scholarships are given based on full time status so they would be taken from you. Information on the HOPE Scholarship for UTK students is here You will also be charged for part or all of the class that you dropped. Here is what the University has to say about DropWithdrawal policy and here is the breakdown of percentage charged. You would be at  at this point.I suggest NOT dropping the course but rather failing and retaking the class for grade replacement because dropping to parttime could haunt you for the rest of your college career.

6238059,0,t1_cyynyxo,If I remember correctly a  was good enough for a few of the university wide merit scholarships. Maybe not. UT likes to say they use a holistic review process for this kind of thing so that might play in your favor. I would wait for your financial aid package before you worry. You go to a magnet school so youre surrounded by achieving students. The truth is youll get to UT and be surrounded by idiots until you get out of the gen ed freshman courses and declare a major. Make sure you talk to your intended department. Some have departmental scholarships. Federal direct loans arent so bad at the end of the day I never received any scholarships because like you I had an ACT score just out of range of those scholarships and a . GPA. I owe the department of education around k after  years which is really on the low end. Otherwise youll have to get private loans or rd party scholarships. In keeping with the motif of honesty your parents since you brought it up anyway make enough to send you to UT with in state tuition barring some massive financial burden on them already. Looking at your resume I still dont think you should have many problems with ut scholarships. Of course they have to know youve done all of that stuff before they can reward it.,UTK,cyyp7ee,1,t5_2spck

7113144,0,t3_3uvkid,We are looking to rent out a bedroom or two in our west Knoxville condo. Attached is a link to photos and another description. The base rent is  per room plus a third of the utilities if only  people living there possibly less if another couple were to move in. We have two cats and two dogs so any potential roomie would need to be pet friendly. You would have a full bath access to a washer and dryer in the unit and shared kitchen and living space. The room is furnished. We have another open room being used as an office now that we would be willing to rent out as well if the right person came along or it can be used as a shared officegaming room as it is being used currently. Theres also a separate laundry facility in the complex as well as pool and tennis courts. Super safe quiet neighborhood. We are a pretty liberal couple open minded and generally accepting of everyone! We are social but also like our space and would respect yours as well. We have previous roommates who can provide references for us as well. If anyone is looking feel free to PM me!,UTK,d1mo30l,1,t5_2spck

Others have gone through this exact process a million times over and each and every one of then turn out fine in the end. Learning as you go in a new environment whether it be college or even a job or sport is part of the fun.

Norman Hollyns threehour course Foundations of Video The Art of Editing covers everything you need to know about the theory. Then there are different essential training courses that will teach you any software you have or want to use e.g. Adobe Premiere Pro Apple Final Cut Pro X or Avid Media Composer.
