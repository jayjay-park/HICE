770294,0,t3_22yoqu,Im from Lexington and I remember as a child midlate s kids would always pass rumors about there being actual vampires in the vampire bat enclosure at the Cinci Zoo. I tried finding some info after a quick Google search but no luck. Maybe someone else heard that one?,UrbanMyths,cgru560,1,t5_2sqgo

Although I think that the Banshee does have some roots in Scottish culture as well however its primarily associated with Irish folklore.  ,UrbanMyths,cjc028b,1,t5_2sqgo
1703379,0,t3_2dwtjt,When I was substitute teaching in Yakima a student told me this story. A few of his friends wanted to check out this Indian graveyard. So he went along. He couldnt say exactly where they were because I think alcohol was involved. When they got there he walked off to take a pee. He said as soon as he started an arm came around his neck and started choking him until he blacked out. He said he looked up as much as he could and saw an Indians face grimacing as he choked him. Eventually his friends came looking for him. Nobody saw anyone else there. It was night and they were out in the middle of sagebrush and desert. He said his arms really hurt when he woke up. When he got home he finally took off his coat. Then he rolled up his sleeves in the classroom. He had long deep scratches running up and down both arms. ,UrbanMyths,cjtvfud,3,t5_2sqgo
3410884,0,t3_2z8wy0,Tons of people over the years have tried to get in there to the point where the reclusive owner has police patrolling the grounds or have them drive by occasionally. She lives in a house near the place and there are tons of storiesrumors about what she does.There are some local blogs up about it and books like Haunted Ohio. Lancaster Oh is a strange place where its stuck between the past the present of itself. Downtown is a great example and the occasional weird thing happens. I dont think to this day no one has caught the arsonist who burned some of it down. Its just always been a place of dark past constantly getting white washed as people like to forget such things.,UrbanMyths,cph2du9,2,t5_2sqgo

5407161,0,t3_3ol9r3,Statesboro Slaughterhouse on the aptly named Slaughterhouse road comes to mind.    Depending on who you ask apparently some time back in the s there was a fire there which killed a number of people. The fire was apparently arson. Long story short I posted this else where it was arson to either cover up or facilitate a murder.  The Slaughterhouse is boarded up and posted so dont try going into it without permission but locals and police will tell you that its not uncommon for them to either see lights from the place or have calls come in from there even though theres no power or phone service.,UrbanMyths,cw2tpnv,1,t5_2sqgo
6314362,0,t1_cz6wehb,Yeah. My dad is from Mexico and he used to tell us all kinds of scary stories about the area he grew up in. One night before bed when I was  years old he told me about a witch who cursed some guy in town and from that day forward the dude shit hair and blood. I was unable to sleep that night.,UrbanMyths,cz7dfzm,2,t5_2sqgo

6667613,0,t3_3ye6hc,I agree with other posters that your moms story sounds more like a weird retelling of the Cropsey myth from New York but I think maybe certain elements she got from elsewhere. The story isnt true but I dont think she was necessarily just making it up off the top of her head. I think she might have heard some stuff about Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital in the s conflated some of it with stuff about NJs first mental hospital at Trenton and then pinned the rest on from horror story tropes. The Trenton Psychiatric Hospital which is still in use but has some abandoned outbuildings crumbling in out of the way parts of the large campus is relatively famous and the subject of some legends and creepy stories. It was New Jerseys first public mental hospital the first American hospital built to the distinctive Kirkbride Plan what we think of as the creepy old mental hospital design Arkham Asylum from the Batman comics is based off of it and founded by the famous reformer Dorthea Dix. However in  Dr. Henry Cotton now notorious took over as superintendent of the facility and due to his belief that mental illness resulted from physical infection set about basically mutilating patients and performing what amounts to human experiments. Some patients had all of their teeth removed as treatment until the s there because of Cottons personal theory of psychiatry. So its got some dark stories circulating about it not without reason. New Jerseys second public mental hospital at the time called New Jersey State Mental Hospital but in modernity called the Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital was built in  to alleviate overcrowding at the Trenton Hospital. Like the Trenton facility it was built to the Kirkbride plan and lobbied for by Dorthea Dix. It had some serious problems mostly resulting from very bad overcrowding and in the s attempts started being made to move patients out to other hospitals or to communitybased homes once the deinstitutionalization movement got going. In the s the facility got a bad reputation there were some escapes sometimes of dangerous people like sex offenders and several staff committed some sex offenses of their own against patients. Finally everybody was moved out to a brand new facility on the grounds in  and the old building which does not appear to have had tunnels although old buildings of that type often did was demolished. Regarding the tunnel issue this seems to be an element that comes up in a lot of urban legends involving psychiatric hospitals specifically. I think that this simply based in architectural reality a lot of large campuses in the Northern parts of America like those of schools or hospitals have subterranean passages. This is usually to transport stuff in case of heavy snowfall and to accommodate steam heating pipes. There are a couple old hospitals which get a lot of play from ghost hunters and urban explorers which have these tunnels Fairfield Hills in Connecticut and I think Pennhurst State School in Pennsylvania.
