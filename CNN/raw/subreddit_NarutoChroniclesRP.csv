The world is going to be a better place with out you in itOetsu instead of slashing stabbed through the shield blindly a few times. Instead of hitting Konan he was hoping to lure her closer to the other side that was the only way this would work. His Full Metal Jacket still covered his body but became clear. A perfect defense he thought. Once he had her move to the other side with an open fist he thrusted his arm into the paper grabbing Konan by the neck and pulling her out. He held her high in the air almost choking the life out of herOne chance... You live or die... Leave never turn around never look back.

3000196,0,t1_co8tztw,Aw you know me so well!  Yoshio said leaping forward at Kain he still had the wooden drill around his arm and he aimed the point for the middle of Kains chest it was an easily dodgeable blow but it was a first strike.  The drill protected his arm from harm and was large enough for him to block blows with so he was fine with using it against Kain.  Doran gave a small smile at her praise it always made a person feel good inside when their training came to fruition.  He made a couple handsigns and a clone appeared.  Doran used the smoke from the clone appearing to switch places with it and they ran forward weaving in and out of eachother.  Doran  through a high punch while the other dived for Kiaros legs trying to wrap her up and take her to the ground.  Katsumi stood straight up and flipped her hair with one hand she revealed the kunailaden hand and tossed two up throwing one and then the other then the other.  She didnt have good aim throwing multple at once so this way made sure the three would have much better accuracy.  Your feeling pretty lame so far the other two are already battling.  She said as snobbyily as possible trying to annoy him.,NarutoChroniclesRP,co8yvb2,1,t5_35kai
3004402,0,t1_co9d557,Kain immediately felt relieved when he heard it was not an army.  Well thats good but it sounds like Orochimaru has again eluded Jiraiyas grasp damn him.Kain explained to the short man As you can see our village just suffered a terrible attack too so we know what its like.  We dont exactly have a Hokage at the moment but I know I speak for the majority of the village when I say well welcome you in your time of need.We cant exactly feed and house thousands of extra bodies we need to take back their village quick.  I can gather up a team maybe we have plenty of able ninja.  Shinzo Hayato Kiaro among others I could even bring my genin team.  It could be a great first mission yet dangerous.  Orochimaru will be dangerous maybe I should go alone... no we need a team.  Perhaps Oetsu and company would be interested.,NarutoChroniclesRP,co9ekg6,1,t5_35kai

In the corner was his equipment and on the table were a few papers. Aang sat down and looked at the papers then sat them down. He retained a proper composure and did his best to be sure that the fact that the one in the room with Kain was a cloneIm going to assume you already know who i am and i know who you are so im going to skip with the introductions.

3029322,0,t1_cobykbn,I dont know Kiaro said doubting how many details she could spill from what Kain had told her. Taking Danzo out in secret wouldve lead to more panic I think. she then said Imagine if your Hokage was assassinated and the people were still in believe Danzo meant good. I think it wouldve lead to more messy business and maybe even rebellions. At least now the people had heard his confessions and true intentions. she shrugged shortly. I just hope the next Hokage will be a bit more... friendly I guess. She looked at Yoshino as she told Kiaro about her experience with Danzo. You actually peeked in his mind? He never found out? Kiaro asked amazed. She eyed the girl with newfound interest. Sorry to ask you this... if you dont want to answer I understand of course but....what did you see? In his mind I mean.

Kiaro pulled her chopsticks apart and started shove the food in her bento box around. Im fine Shinzo. Kiaro said smiling Just sore from getting my ass kicked. and she gave him a nudge in his side. She was though. She figured she would have some nice bruises and lumps tomorrow. So... How does one stay on the ice? she asked Without falling of course. ,NarutoChroniclesRP,cof7193,1,t5_35kai

Visually his fingers couldnt have wrapped around the hilt any harder or else the steel would shatter. Oetsu looked at the two Uchiha boys both of them opposites but the same. Oetsu had to protect his Uchiha at all costs. Slowly with great focus he activated Steel Release Full Metal Jacket which encased his body in a clear protective layer. He was ready to fight. He had fought Uchiha before never two never any this experienced. However he knew how to do so.So what is it then...? What say the both of you?,NarutoChroniclesRP,conktna,1,t5_35kai

Yoshino replied to Choziin. But I definitely didnt need to read your mind to figure out the Bakery Buffet thing youre quite transparent when it comes to food. She said chuckling softly. She was surprised by just how comfortable she was right now just talking to Choziin as she leaned against him and she made the mental note to get him alone with her more often. She subconsciously snuggled up to him a little closer and smiled.I dont want to get to know the gorillas Ive already set my sights on the koala. Have you ever heard a koala growl at night? Theyre quite aggressive creatures and size doesnt indicate strength. Im a small girl yet Im still quite powerful She said crossing her arms in defiance.

He was furious Shingetsu jumped on the mans back toppling him over and using Hydrifacation to beef up his left arms muscles and planting it in the ninjas stomach.  The Rain ninja lost his breath breathing rapidly to try and catch some air.  With his mouth open Shingetsu liquified his other arm absorbing the mist around them to use more water hosing it down the rain Ninjas throat and nose drowning him.  DIE DIE DIE DIE!

Id love a demonstration some day Yui replied to Kiaro with a grin nodding in approval as she filled up a bowl of food for the cats. Im no anywhere near the level of my relatives either Yoshi is still young and inexperienced so he cant quite do the perfect tiger transformation yet. But well get there too She said sounding confident.Mentioning the word nindog earned Kiaro a glare from Yui.
