609518,0,t1_cg9jhpj,The idea of his other films being Memory Films got me thinking about the way Wes Anderson portrays death. The way the deaths are treated in GBH are distinctly different from his others. Death in Tenenbaums Life Aquatic Darjeeling Fantastic Mr. Fox all have the same kind of structure. In GBH there are no quick flickering shots implying the action. There is no funeral scene. We dont get closure and I suppose thats because Mr. Moustafa never moved on.This is all just confirming for me how badly I need a second and third and fourth viewing!,wesanderson,cg9jzdk,1,t5_2rvsw

1548802,0,t1_cj8lh7f,I felt the same way until I rewatched it a few times. I think what I missed in the theater was a good soundtrack. I still love the filmsoundtrack it just wasnt memorable like Rushmore Royal Tenenbaums or Life Aquatic.,wesanderson,cjaezaa,2,t5_2rvsw
2081646,0,t3_2iorz5,Lolita. Perfect for him the glittering prose and dry wit matches his style. The tone is darker than Wes usually is however he is perfect for it. Wes movies do not attempt to resemble reality and rather reflect a very subjective view of the worldsomething that other adaptions of Lolita have missed. ,wesanderson,cl4f8cu,11,t5_2rvsw
