6094942,0,t1_cyif2lh,Why is Gay Marriage not a right?Because the only possible source for rights has not given it as such. In fact the only possible source for rights has condemned it. It is pretty much exactly the same as regular marriage but only for their same gender.You mean its the same based on the criteria of comparison youre using? Clearly if youre not coming up with some critical differences those standards are the problem. Why should anyone else even care about what gender someone loves?Not love. Hate. Asserting its love does nothing to demonstrate its love. Love has objective standards. You being an atheist cannot even account for objective morality nor can your worldview comport with it. It isnt affecting anyone at all.I teach your children lies to see righteousness as evil and to hate the truth along with anyone who teaches it.  every supporter of homosexuality everbut now take the above with the following in contextWhy do you care? Who is it hurting? What does it matter to you what two consenting adults do in the privacy of their own home?  every supporter of homosexuality everYou see you take issue with the PUBLIC element of homosexuality which is effecting and changing everything around you deceiving people and directing hatred at you calling you hateful and crazy for enunciating simple truths etc and they dishonestly assert that you are taking issue with something youre not even peripherally mentioning through implication.And of course thats totally disregarding the fact that even if it is two consenting people in private that theyre still harming themselves and each other...and the fact that were supposed to love all of our fellow humans and so we should care a great deal about this deep and substantial harm theyre doing to themselves and each other.If God was real Athiest here. then hes an a.By what objective standards would God not an atheist straw man version but the version I would affirm as valid be an ass? Let me guess a bunch of standards you will assert are objective which are anything but. There is no POSSIBLE even HYPOTHETICAL locus within a naturalisticatheistic framework that can account for truly objective morality and by objective morality that is to say morals that are true even if every human past present and future disagreedAll people have a worldview. Atheism is a worldview. Atheism is a religion. It has items of faith. It has epistemological presuppositions which are neither falsifiable testable nor evidenced. Atheism is a self refuting set of presuppositions. For example scientism teaches that all truth claims should either have physical evidence or be deemed false. But there is no physical evidence for that very claim itself and so that claim itself must be false by its own standards. Likewise post modernist conceptions of tolerance are all self refuting and hypocritical. ,norainbows,cyifkhr,2,t5_2vo9o
9806564,0,t3_5cng35,Sorry Bi Guy.I  agree with you. Marriage should  in my opinion not be something that is governed by... well the government. The churches invented it and maintained its rules for years. By this fact I believe the churches should be able to do whatever they want.However before this is possible there needs to be some kind of other legal binding that gets attached to marriage that can also be attached to civil partnerships and so forth. That way every legal benefit to a marriage is not specific to marriage.However in terms of getting married in a nice church with all the bells and whistles that definitely is not something that is a right to everyone. It like complaining why a  year old isnt allowed in the kids ball play area. It was created for kids and I know it looks fun but sorry its not for you.,norainbows,dalvb4r,1,t5_2vo9o
