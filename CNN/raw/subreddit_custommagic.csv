942303,0,t1_chaylio,Delve Im glad youre keeping an eye on the green common. It looks set to be the Invisible Stalker  Butchers Cleaver of the set in that it sets up a functionally unanswerable advantage based on nonrare cards and will make people sad and angry when they have to play against it.I still dont think a mechanic that hates itself is a good fit for modern design. Thats actually probably the biggest problem with it.Delve vs. Recycle I suppose its fair to say that this is better than the Innistrad case. I was definitely discounting the informal mechanics youve mentioned. I dont think its too far off from Threshold vs. Flashback though and Wizards has definitely proclaimed that a mistake at this point.Recycle Recycle just doesnt differ from Unearth enough to change its flavor for me? What about it feels different to you? Is it mostly the name?If its really about flashback as an added bonus I think youre probably better off going back to the coverup templating where its an ability that turns selfmill into an upside the same way that flashback did.Complexity In a world where Delve is a mechanic that you have to watch in constructed knowing the exact count of your opponents graveyard and what overcurve things they could cast next turn is imperative for even midlevel play. The timebomb creatures arent even on board where people can look at them and remember them anymore theyre potentially in hand. The more I think about it the more convinced I am that this is actually worse than the Odyssey problem.Advantage Fair enough. I can see where both of those colors are missing something and wanted a mechanic. Advantage seems like a good fit.

1085173,0,t3_26imqt,Given that this card is meant for funsies Id say you can go a little more extreme provided youre willing to change the casting cost if necessary. You have a very good base to work with but we can cram more Godzilla flavor into this slice of the color pie.The first thing that sticks out is that Godzilla is just flat out ridiculously resilient to any nonKaiju damage he might sustain. While there have been exceptions Godzilla almost never goes down permanently to something that isnt also a  ft. monster. We cant just make him indestructible no matter how much we might really really want to but if we were to slap on something like whenever Godzilla is dealt damage by a noncreature source regenerate Godzilla then we have an ability that captures the essence of how tough the King of All Monsters really is without making him impossible to kill.Secondly I agree with others here that the current red ability is a little superfluous on a  trampler and flavorwise his firebreath is well represented by that fight ability but theres another red ability that Godzilla always has that we should definitely pay homage to just plain fucking wrecking shit. For this I think uMangipan had the right idea whenever Godzilla attacks each player sacrifices a land. Annihilator would be cool but part of what makes him Godzilla in the first place is the indiscriminate destruction that follows in his wake.Now I will freely admit that once CMCs get past six or seven I start to have trouble determining whether something is balanced or not so Im not going to be much help there but those are my thoughts on what to consider adding to your Godzilla card.TLDR  This.,custommagic,chrmx02,4,t5_2sbcz

See again Epharas Radiance So bad even though it enables all sorts of stuff people never look at em.You know about these right?

An R wild guess that first makes you discard  at random and then draws  would definitely be fine and remember that CC costed cards unless really good without having to gimmick it up rarely see play because its just so hard to cast one of the main reasons Wild Guess never went anywhere!,custommagic,cidee9t,1,t5_2sbcz

1363369,0,t1_cin6b2t,A It is essentially the same as cant be blocked if you choose the land type. There are situations where it isnt but it is so close as to be essentially indistinguishable. Every color gets landwalk for its own type and for some but not all other colors types. Green has plenty of forestwalk including forestwalkgranting and it has creatures with Islandwalk andor Swampwalk but it cannot grant those with any existing card. Green also doesnt get Mountainwalk or Plainswalk okay theyre on one card each and one is part of a cycle in Portal Three Kingdoms. Note also that these fall along allyenemy color lines this holds true for landwalk in every color.There are three cards in the game that allow for landwalkgranting of a type other than its own Travelers Cloak Barbarian Guides and Giant Slug. The Cloak is monoblue and the other two are old enough that they cannot be used as valid precedence because the color pie shifts over time.Why is there not more landwalk granting? Because it is essentially unblockable. But where there is it is going to be in the color best at evasion Blue. Green currently doesnt grant straightup unblockability theres probably some exceptions but it is not part of Greens slice of the pie but blue does. Since landwalk of your choice and cant be blocked are so similar and since the only valid precedence we have to go on is monoblue one can safely conclude that no this is not an effect which monogreen is intended to have.TLDR Landwalk is used in every color but different colors have different ways of using it. Green doesnt grant landwalk other than forestwalk.,custommagic,cin6rro,1,t5_2sbcz

1850018,0,t3_2froje,With the exception of the black one which wouldnt be printed these days anyways graveyard order is no longer kept track of in standard or modern they all seem extremely powerful.The white one slots any control deck in standard and could even see play in heavy control modern lists. The blue one would see play in any deck that has creatures with ETB effects and is especially powerful with Modern and Legacy allstar Snapcaster Mage. Just imagine a Karakas already powerful for bouncing Venser Vendilion Clique Thalia etc. but for any creature on the battlefield. It makes combat a nightmare for any opponent as you can easily save any blocked creature that would die.To see why the red land is broke just compare it to Barbarian Ring a fairly powerful land that sees play in some Legacy Burn lists. Rather than conditional singleusage damage your land allows any aggressive red deck to funnel its excess mana into direct damage to opponents utility creatures blockers and life again and again and again. Look at your green land and compare it to Pendelhaven. Yeah the one mana is important but the fact that this slots into literally any green deck that runs creatures AKA . of green decks makes it extremely powerful. The thing about lands is that most the time making them legendary isnt enough of a downside if they still tap for colors. The mana costs on these effects are in need of some serious increases for these lands to be even remotely printable.,custommagic,ckc4fm7,5,t5_2sbcz

2268219,0,t3_2l72kh,So really whenever you want to do anything youre going to target enchanted player first then do whatever it is you were planning on doing?  Someones day is about to get really shitty. But seriously while Curses are almost meant for EDHMultiplayer they almost seem to be too good.  Maybe its just me but Curses incite a weird sort of bloodlust in someone.  If you get a curse of bloody tomes on you sure thats all well and good but know that every mill player  in my playgroup is gonna be targeting you.  If on the other hand you get a Curse of Bloodletting on you and you dont have an immediate response consider it your last round of turns.  Maybe its the fact that doing  damage is so much more satisfying than  every person without fail will end you.  And you will a very shitty time die way to early fail to politics and probably get salty.  So my group has discouraged curses because they lead to very frenzied play and make the game far less fun for at least  person.  Why am I telling you all this?  Because as interesting as curses are they are far more powerful than any other effect.  Their multiplayer capability far exceeds anything else you can do in a single stroke because they make you a target.  And a game is not fun when youre targeted by  other people.

2451287,0,t3_2nlcdr,What grabs my attention about this set is its voodoo theme. I know very little to nothing about it and I imagine many others are the same so I think it would be powerful for this set to really focus on expressing that. Unique names are important and I see youve already been doing that. Explanatory flavour text that teaches a bit about the culture would do wonders. For example a brief explanation of A Year and a Day on the card itself would be great.As an aside the text for that card in particular could be made more concise which would give it more room for flavour text toogt Return target creature that died this turn from your graveyard to the battlefield. etcPossess and Vanishing nicely instill a sense of spirituality. I also really like the keyword Ritual particularly the nonmana instances like paying life or tapping creatures. Theres fun room to play here. The wording of such an effect is a little off and would more accurately begt As you cast this spell you may ...Im worried about Chorus because it relies on using creatures in a wedge that has the two most spelloriented colours. The flavour of Bards and music is cool and appropriate to your theme but I would expect them to show up in RGW instead. Even your tricoloured land text references feelings of community and care. As a mechanic its tricky to avoid overpowered effects but it has much potential for optimization and thus lends itself well to growth with advanced player skill.Bribery is an interesting concept. I would personally avoid owning such cards as a whiteblue player though since the lack of control is unnerving  especially in control colours.

I understand that WotC wishes to open their borders to new players that interaction of so many strange cases can have some convoluted rule disputes and that spreading new ideas out gives the game a longer lifespan but the complexity of the game is a large part of what made it attractive to play for me in the first place. WotC is a business with goals that can often conflict with player satisfaction while I am a fan attempting to replicate what made me fall in love with the game.

3127855,0,t1_com6vhj,I think you get the essence of the ability. The fact that you dont know whether its the draw two cards spell or the destroy target creature spell gives you a very important decision. The point is to try and figure out by mana spent or targets chosen whether or not you would rather take the risk or discard a card. Maybe you have a bunch of lands in your hand you dont want or a creature on the board you really want to keep. Ultimately the point of having the ability is cheap cards as well. A Divination for two is definitely something a blue player wants.I tried to keep all the cards relatively low impact although youre right the destory creature one might be problematic. As for the flavor I agree it doesnt grok too well I was trying to figure out the best cost and discard felt appropriate but Im failing to see why now. What do you feel would make sense? Life loss?

3468613,0,t3_2zygjt,So my favourite legendary creature is Melek Izzet Paragon. I hadnt actually looked into his lore until just now and apparently he got shanked by Ral Zarek absorbing his energy. So I guess my planeswalker version pulled a Doctor Manhattan and reassembled himself when his spark ignited. Or his spark ignited because he reassembled himself. Also it occured to me after I uploaded the image that his  should let him fix the order of the cards that go back to the top of the library.MelekProbably my favourite creature though is Phalanx Leader and as far as I know he has no actual lore to speak of so I had to work from the ground up name included. My favourite thing to do in my monowhite decks with Phalanx Leader is swarm soldier tokens and spread the  love. It made sense from PLs original flavour text for him to be focused on dropping counters protecting his men and eventually inspiring new troops with his leadership.IgetisI fully admit that the costing of both of these is probably terrible. Im not hugely experienced with planeswalkers.,custommagic,cpnnatl,1,t5_2sbcz

The one issue with Hodui is that I think hes a bit too cheap especially as unlike creatures for devotion purposes you have zero cost artifacts like the moxes or the net in DTK that could easily get you a  on turn . Sarkhan Going Mardu was a great choice and I particularly like the  ability as opposing Sarkhans  dragon abilities etc. Champion of the Soil Great flavor but as Archer would say Do you want me to have all my lands out by turn ?

3488323,0,t1_cppvwex,I actually think garnet is more UR.  Her passion for steven and the other gems along with her more impulsive nature is what obviously makes her red.  Blue on the other hand is a little more subtle.  Garnet often lets Steven try things that none of the other gems had thought of.  In my opinion shes doing it to gain more knowledge and understanding in order to protect the gems.  That along with her future vision powers I know powers arent associated with color but mechanically it fits make her subtly blue to me.  During the season finale I think Garnet sums it up best in her song with the line I am their fury I am their patience I am a conversation.Edit Also just look at ruby and sapphire I know its kinda cliche to say This blue colored character is blue but Ruby is very red and Sapphire is very blue with a splash of red.,custommagic,cppw703,1,t5_2sbcz

3589358,0,t3_31gloo,If you dont want a player to be able to drop them tap them for mana not pay costs and have them return to hir or her hand then you need to change the wording to use replacement effects rather than triggered abilities see Lotus Vale for an example.Except for the Jeskai land which is decidedly the best of the bunch perhaps too much these costs are all pretty steep. It might not make all of them unplayable but... Moorland Thicket Abzan would definitely be playable but I suspect only in decks that abuse graveyard strategies. Think things like Dredge. This may be cause to worry to be honest. Mossy Sandur Mardu is really bad and probably unplayable. Subterranean Jungle Sultai is pretty bad but ok I guess? Theres only so much you can expect from a common multicolor land. Was it intended for you to be able to tap itself to its own ability? Definitely unplayable in competitive or semicompetitive scenarios. Thermal Vent Temur is the next pretty bad but ok I guess? land. Looks even worse than Subeterranean Jungle but still acceptable Limited fixing. Thing is I dont think even Limited would play this land whereas in a super slow format I can imagine Subterranean Jungle being played.All in all I believe this cycle needs polishing.EDIT Whats with lists and this subreddit? xx,custommagic,cq1exml,1,t5_2sbcz

Gemstone Caverns is still a playable land if you dont have it in your opening hand not as good but still playable so it feels like it rewards you for having it in your opening hand instead of punishing you for not.I think this card needs to do at least something if its not in your opening hand. I would give it a miraclelike effect if you draw it during your draw step. Something like If this was the first card you drew during your draw step reveal it.

4406214,0,t1_csm8lc9,Yeah I think its a ritual. Especially if you were paying  CMC for it. Green occasionally gets stuff like this but only really when paired with red BurningTree Emissary Manamorphose. Blue doesnt get ritual effects ever. As you said it sometimes gets land untapping with stuff like Rewind. Black was the original ritual color Dark Ritual but MaRo had talked about how they moved it to red since red is the color of immediacy. Now black gets extra mana effects like Crypt Ghast Liliana of the Dark Realms and Nirkana Revenant. With LotDR Lilianas Specter and a few other things black very occasionally fetches a swamp. For land fetching Green is primary white might be secondary and black is tertiary Id say.

Blue doesnt have hard removal. Green just kind of sighs dejectedly at spells on the stack. Red cant blow up enchantments or high toughness creatures. And yes black has trouble with artifacts and enchantments. But thats what makes Magic so wonderful. If you see a black mage coming stock up on those defensive auras. If you see a blue mage coming start lobbing threats faster than they can answer them. And so on. Counterplay and blind spots for each color are the things that give Magic its depth.,custommagic,ctj0dm3,2,t5_2sbcz
4673589,0,t1_ctiwb5d,gt If you dont like the strengths and weaknesses of red find another color.The thing of it is the other three colors can touch everything. Green blue and white have answers to all kinds of cards. Red cant touch enchantments with the exception of a few niche cards Zealous Conscripts Chaos Warp... and black cant touch artifacts or enchantments at all as far as I know.This isnt the strengths and weaknesses of red or black. Its a terrible imbalance that needs to be fixed. For the record Im a greenblue player so this has nothing to do with me whining about my favorite colors being weak  I actually dislike playing red and black the most.Simple solutions would be to allow red to have random removal  Destroy target permanent chosen at random that target player controls kind of like Tyrant of Discord. Beyond that red embodies the element of fire which is why it can burn artifacts so easily but it also embodies the element of earth Rockslide Elemental for example. Nature opposes Magic as is very common in green. And since the earth element usually correlates to nature it wouldnt be entirely unreasonable for red to have some kind of enchantment hate. Even if not red could at least punish people for using the enchantments it cant get rid of. For examplegt Hastegt Whenever  enters the battlefield it gets  until end of turn for each enchantment target opponent controls.  attacks that player this turn if able.Black is much harder to justify giving... anything to really. Beyond death and scary things black doesnt seem to embody a whole lot thematically. Artifacts and enchantments are both known to wear out over time though and black is known for making things rot and decay. So if I had to design a mechanic for black to remove enchantments and artifacts it would be over time.

Adding the ability to make it a  for  mana when youre in GW makes this an incredibly good aggro card. Compare to Beetleform Mage a good pick in DGM with comparable transformed stats to the Rider however its base form is behind curve and requires you committing to both colors to cast it. The Rider is fine even if its never pumped.I love Flectospell to death. Love. It. I think Soulcaller Selkie removes a lot of the fun from Flash. Because the top card is revealed the opponent will never be surprised by the creature. So naturally the opponent wont be walking into the trap and will most likely pass turn unless theyre already very far ahead on board. But passing doesnt actually solve the problem since you can just play the creature anyway and be up a card. My point is the Selkie wont play like Prophet of Kruphix itll play like a mix between Propaganda and an inconsistent Phyrexian Arena. And frankly sitting around doing nothing while you watch your opponent get ahead on board and cards is a very unfun position to be in.

A  flier alone is about the most white should get for W at common.The Stark Retribution should probably be uncommon or even rare just because of its name.

White only has two  CMC creatures with a power of  at common and uncommon Loxodon Convert and Crude Rampart Crude Rampart was printed over a decade ago and Loxodon Converts flavor allows for the break in this convention.Steadfast Sentry should probably be a  or a .

5763863,0,t1_cxb8rpo,This card is fighting a war on two fronts. This card is unreliable. If you are in color and you dont have the correct mana then there is a risk of also not drawing this card. You cant afford to sit around waiting for it to show up when you cant cast half your spells.. This card may not do anything. If you are in color and you do have the correct mana then this card literally does nothing and is  a waste of a card slot.In modern the mana base is so good that more often then not you will not need this card. Adding a cantrip or an anthem effect would go a long way to making this card relevant when it would otherwise be a dead draw.In EDH I cant imagine wanting to Trinkey Mage this guy over Sol Ring or Top.

7030427,0,t3_4bxf8h,From the top General note you dont need to capitalize every keyword in a list of keywords just the first one on the typeline. Nothing about Abraham feels blue. Ceer Strategize is spelled wrong and also doesnt really feel like a thing to keyword. Why not just stick the draw a card on the end of the activated ability? Until end of turn should probably be in there. Number of creature cards not amount. Centar You draw two cards.... Madness doesnt need to be capitalized. Dalium is the weirdest lord I have ever seen. Also just noticed this Unless the line of type is just listing keywords every line needs to end in a period. Also weird spacing issues with the second line. Might have hit the space bar a few extra times. Gendruff Subtypes like Equipment need to be capitalized. The ability doesnt work as written because the token enters the battlefield before the equipment resolves so you cant attach it yet. Maybe word it as an ETB?  Hirkus First strike strike doesnt need to be capitalized protection from Beasts from Dragons and from Zombies creature types do need to be capitalized. The ETB should probably have the word target somewhere in there. Their owners library. Marvun Less than what? The ability should probably be worded At the beginning of your upkeep if its an extra turn the other bit. Also feels like this could possibly be abused? Sacrifice him leave him in the graveyard have a Feldon of the Third Path in play make a token every turn and sac the tokens for infinite turns.  Jura When not whenever. Target players as in belonging to that player.. Period at the end of that sentence. Artifact cards not artifacts also that needs to be tested carefully because artifacts can do really stupid things when you drop em without casting em. Urdor is fine. Underwhelming sure but fine. Porjas is begging to be broken. Dunno how but Im sure someone can come up with it. Also surge doesnt need to be capitalized. The Eternal Embrace No wording issues but again feels like this could potentially become a problem. The Deep Should use a color indicator. Interesting effect though. Creature type is also interesting  Im not exactly horrified of a  defender. Terthos Kinda boring but is worded correctly. Tarus ...less to cast... This one I think I like the most so far. Shade When you cast not whenever. Rule of thumb When is for things that are probably only gonna happen once like casting things or dying or entering the battlefield. Whenever is for repeated things like creatures attacking or you drawing a card. Instant and sorcery card. Ren Goes infinite with a Soul Warden with no way to stop. Might could make this a may ability? Even then thats a turn  infinite very very easily. Zortus Not touching this one. Having all abilities of all creatures in your yard gets... weird.

7285943,0,t1_d269vcj,No they cheated. Cheating in this context means removing the essential feature of A the quality that pretty much defines a thing as A yet continuing to call it A. A classic example is devoid. You know why a large portion of not only the design community but even the mainstream MtG community hated devoid? Because its cheating. What makes a spell colorless is the fact you dont pay colorless mana. Period. Devoid takes away this essential feature but refuses to call the colored spell for what it is colored.Yes sometimes you have to cheat in design. It happens. There was probably no other way to meet the goals they set for the Eldrazi in BFZ without using devoid mechanically unify the Eldrazi without using tribal and be compatible with artifacts and awaken. Devoid was the best option they had...but perhaps the fact they had to cheat is indicative their design goals were wrong to begin with.Similarly an essential feature of legends is that they are rare or mythic. They are unique. Extraordinary. Making an uncommon card and slapping the legendary supertype with some flavor justification is cheating.gt MaRo would say that what matters is technically not commonness but asfan and the asfan on dragons in DTK was okay. Certainly the entire set isnt considered a failure because of this.In the State of the Design  Maro commented the dragon theme in DTK simply didnt work properly. They needed common dragons. Asfan sleightofhand wasnt enough.Also Maro gave a  to Tarkir block and commented that KTK was much more successful than DTK. If the  is the average over the entire Tarkir block then DTK gets an even poorer grade probably something like  or . Of course the set isnt a Kamigawalike bomb but its certainly a failure.

So I considered the counters being placed when you take control of a card instead. Heres the brief gist of itgt ubw t sacrifice a creature Gain control of target non land permanent an opponent controls or put a nonland permanent from their graveyard into play under your control then put X seed counters on it where X is the sacrificed creatures power.At the beginning of your end phase remove a seed counter from each permanent you control. Then sacrifice permanents you dont own that have no seed counters.But taking some hints from your design it might be best to exile them.

8089798,0,t3_4py0iv,Im rather partial to Vronos the Grey Fencer myself. He even has a history with Garruk! If you dont mind resurrecting him....Basically his story is that he was an Elite Inquisitor for the church of Avacyn. He and a group of others were sent to investigate a town overcome with lycanthropes. After cleansing the town they were left with some children. The group took them in intending to raise them under the wings of the church and settled in for the night. Vronos awoke later to a tiny werewolf mutilating his face and most of his group either dead or close to being so. after putting up a fight his spark lit right as he was about to be killed. He was sent to Esper where he made a deal to let the AEthermages study him in return for knowledge. This would include his knowledge of AEtherium which he used to make his filigreed mask and reconstruct his body before eventually returning to Avacyn some time later to repent and face his punishments for abandoning the church. Avacyn put him in charge of a portion of the cathars and they gained a rather good reputation. This is where the nickname Grey Fencer took hold and the card Mask of Avacyn shows the masks that his cathars all wore.During the events of M Vronos was tasked with hunting down Garruk and returning him to Avacyn in hopes that she could cleanse him of the Veils curse only for Garruk to kill him.As far as the whole dead thing goes you could retcon it that he managed to survive if just barely losing his mask to Garruks trophy belt but still being able to repair his body to some extent. While hed fit best as W in my opinion I could see him being any combo of Esper colors or even colorless.Other possible charactersGlissa Sunseeker She is confirmed as having a spark but never ascended before Vorinclex compleated her. Could fill the role of an antagonist if Phyrexia is involved. GB most likely.Masrath and Tessebik Blank slates lore and mechanics wise. From the Dominarian AcademyCrucius Possible planeswalker. Basically a progenitor of the whole Etherium thing which may or may not have been him identifying the absense of red and green mana and attempting to rejoin the shards. Could fit as some a combo within esper or potentially color.RavenMan possible planeswalker. Basically the wise old man stereotype for Liliannas back story. if a planeswalker hes likely wrapped up in innistrad currently. fits monoblack most likely.If you ware doing time you might take a look at some premending planeswalkers with ambiguous ends for their stories though Id avoid using anyone wrapped up in the Urza story.,custommagic,d4pd8c8,2,t5_2sbcz

Haste is nothing Id have expected on this card and I wouldnt miss it. Its not required mechanically and flavorwise and makes the card feel clunky and unnecessarily overpowered. Id also not make the haunted creatures become spirits themselves as in your updated version. Spirits haunting spirits doesnt seem like good design. Also its an allinonecardcombo get one of your spirits killed in mainphase  haunt a creature it becomes a spirit attack with that creature it gets blocked and dies haunt another creature .... Such designs shouldnt exist but at least its easily solvable by just removing the mentioned parts.Lastly your card shouldnt say Other spirits. Other than what?

I know their data shows cards that use luck are not usually very popular so I was hoping we could find a way to make them more appealing without breaking balance.it is why you see these cards only have downsides attached to their randomness because if it were the other way around having a chance of something good happening I feel they would be less useful and appealing so instead they always do something good and have some chance to do something bad but only a chance to balance it and make it more attractive Ive make them more powerful than their mana cost would usually allow but not overly so.I believe there is a type of player that would be serve right by spells like these those willing to take a small negative in exchange for more power in this example Ive also provided way for players to increase the odds in their favor with the creatures you see in here.,custommagic,d5o76z7,1,t5_2sbcz

8423467,0,t3_4v10aq,For my Chrono Trigger tribute set.Plot SummaryFor those unfamiliar with the game its a Squaresoft time travelbased RPG where a bunch of crazy shit does down because of events occurring in parallel timelines.The key event that opens the player up to these different epochs is Lucca a friend of the main character tries to invent a teleportation device but winds up accidentally sending a subject back in time. Realizing this possibility and the need to control it she invents the Gate Key which allows the party to travel between eras using existing portals.When the party arrives in the futuristic era they find it overrun by technology and robots and Luccas expertise is helpful in particular for the purposes of repairing these robots one of which becomes a character in the party.GameplaySo thats the story impetus for these two cards. The real Golem synergy comes in the second set in the block so Lucca is a bit of a setup card. She may however be overpowered based on value alone. Need some feedback balancing her and making sure there are no issues with flavour templating etc. Shes a biggerbody Trinket Mage that cant take  or Xcards but puts it straight into play instead. Maybe she is balanced after all.The Gate Key is a bad birthing pod. There is some bottomoflibrary synergy in the set and moreso again in the next set but there arent a lot of ways that I think this can be profitably abused. Its mostly there for its story piece and if Lucca can play it for free and it doesnt cost you a card why not  worst case scenario she makes a Golem out of it.Would love any and all feedback.

Or if you really want that type of effect just give them all cant be countered and hexproof.Then focus on the other abilities. If they can be countered  killed you might want to give them cast or enter the battlefield triggers to help hedge against the  mana investment if it gets countered  killed you still get the value of the trigger. That kind of addresses the issue you were trying to address with the pay  or use the same color or else this creature cant be countered amp has hexproof thing. Or really push the other ability. That being said theyre pretty cool and it is totally something I wouldnt put it past Magic to have printed  years ago.

Other suspend cards have very high casting costs though and remember that if you choose to planeshift your spell it stays in exile until you can planeshift another spell to cast that one.

I suggest taking notes on these Mark Rosewater articles Nuts and bolts  the color pie revisited and  years  lessons.Also spells that have a free casting cost are insanely strong and wouldnt be printed in modern times. Green rarely gets fliers. Colorless creatures are usually artifact constructs but creatures that are phrexyian or eldrazi are the exception. Searching your library for a random card is terrible the shuffle times will potentially be dreadfully slow. White creature removal usually has a drawback like the target has to be attacking or blocking. A  cost  no drawback flier is also too good for its super cheap cost.Twofold and paper goombas abilities make no sense. Why deal damage to planeswalkers only? What damage is it preventing? it doesnt say prevent all damage till end of turn. What sharpest corner? Maybe you can make sharp corner a keyword.  Can you only activate it when it attacks?

It makes for an interesting hidden drawback to the ability.gt All that said having control over how much you pay is a big part of the effect and isnt something that should be cut from the keyword.The mechanic is not viable if you allow free cost splitting because it allows for free spells generally impossible to balance and because it has major memory issues you really have to write down what you paid. If free cost splitting is a nonnegotiable to you then its not a mechanic WotC would ever print.

9910880,0,t1_dazd70j,Because the new type exclusively overlaps with one single other preexisting card type. Theres a reason we dont have a billion card types thats the enitire point of having subtypes. Why arent Auras a different card type or equipments or vechicles? Because if they were magic would be that much harder to design cohesively. You still get to make the cards that can make those subtypes stand out but you also get to include them in the larger more interactive types.It isnt so much Because its always been done that way! but more theres very good reason things are done that way.Planeswalkers managed to make themselves more than established with  cards when they first premiered. They didnt need twenty years of sets. They created niche purposes right away that set themselves apart from every other card. What does these functionally do from enchantments? The mechanic on them that could just as easily fit on the same amount of text space as an enchantment? What does the type Realm add at all in comparison to Enchantment  Realm? This is like saying you want to have Vehicles instead of Artifact  Vehicles. And if anything vehicles are more different than artifacts then realms are from enchantments.It isnt a matter of wait and see what you could do with realms its a matter of whats to gain by not making these enchantment  realms? There just isnt enough design space to make the distinction worth while. All of these cards do nothing really different from enchantments thematically or mechanically.,custommagic,dazesn9,6,t5_2sbcz

9978225,0,t1_db86akb,Ah I see. I do think this belongs at uncommon for two reasonsComplexity. The powers that be dislike shuffling at common with an immense passion even though this subverts that a bit since youll usually use it during your precombat main phase some time before any player will draw again. Its also not the easiest to understand at first glance though. Particularly that the ability will be countered if the targeted creature becomes illegal without shuffling herself in anyway.Power level. Its effectively a Bronze Sable with as close to Exile target creature as blue gets stapled on. It doesnt do as much double duty in blocking as Void Stalker did but thats still a potent combination I would rarely mind picking early in a Draft.

10241090,0,t1_dc4t7i3,Thanks for the feedback! This was exactly the sort of thing I was looking for! Okaygt a  mana Loot on a card that is arguably stronger than the Modern Played Desolate LighthouseLighthouse was the reference card that I had while designing Shies Study. At first it was discard two cards but then I changed it to be in line with Zentaras Temple which in hindsight was a terrible idea since Id made that without any real reference point.That said lets look at the differences between this and lighthouse. This is better in that it costs  less to activate and can produce two different colors of mana as opposed to zero. This is worse in that it comes into play tapped is legendary and is a rummage rather than a loot. Id say the two are about equal but I could be convinced otherwise.gt Or Togis Cabin which is an insane combat trick that would in my opinion likely see Modern infect play. Its unconditional hexproof given by a land.I mean its an on board combat trick that cant be activated the turn its played which I think helps. It gives the opponent a turn to deal with your biggest threats and after that paying effectively  mana a turn to give one thing hexproof I dont think is that crazy. Again though could be convinced otherwise.gt Zentaras Temple is an insane value engine. Fill your yard with prized Amalgams and scrapheap scroungers and Vengeful Pharoahs as an easy recurrable effect.Im sorry but I dont quite follow how Zentaras Temple plays into that strategy. I suppose its a discard outlet?gt Sunhome a  mana effect is instead now competing with a  mana effect that gives Prowess additionally.Sunhome gives double strike Pyris Chapel gives first strike.

10259740,0,t3_5mv0iv,I agree with uIceMetalPunk that insanity counters need an innate effect to not be parasitic but Im afraid I have a slightly widerreaching problem with the effect.Ive seen a fair few people propose the idea of basically reverse poison  bad counters you accept for powerful effects. Theres an innate issue with that however these mechanics are a nonbo with themselves.Its the inverse of a linear mechanic. That awesome feeling you get when you rip four cards off the top with a poweredup Accumulated Knowledge or move your Dwynen GiltLeaf Daen into place alongside your Elvish Archdruid and Imperious Perfect or swing in with an evasive creature and pile ten exalted triggers onto the stack... its the opposite of that. Each time you cast a spell or activate an ability that gives you insanity counters your other spells and abilities that give you insanity counters get directly measurably worse.Most Magic mechanics at worst dont care about whether you have a few or a lot of cards that use them  you can play one card with kicker or an entire deck of kicker cards and the individual cards arent made any worse regardless of your choice. Insanity counters want you to keep their use to an absolute minimum the optimal scenario is actually only to play one card that makes you insane.You could probably offset this with some cards that let you squeeze value out of being insane but that makes the mechanic both more parasitic and less unambiguously bad for you which makes it much harder to use insanity counters as a cost. I really dont want to be blunt but Im not sure this idea has legs.,custommagic,dc6zxc9,3,t5_2sbcz

As currently worded only one creature or planeswalker will be targeted and eligible for destruction this way regardless of how many players choose to sacrifice. Another qualifier can be used if the targets dont have to be restricted to the player whose opportunity it is to sacrifice but some qualifier needs to exist to make the number of targets greater than one.Also the targeted creatures or planeswalkers is chosen during the activation of the ability so without considering any external effects the player will always be able to choose the targeted creature or planeswalker to sacrifice.,custommagic,dcjziuh,1,t5_2sbcz

Take a look at most legendary creatures published in modern history ETB effects arent supercommon and certainly arent the only effects on legendaries.
