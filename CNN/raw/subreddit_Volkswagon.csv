It only presents itself when the temperate drops late fall winter time. Honestly your best bet would be to just replace the faulty unit. You can mess your systems up if you start  changing things with vagcom and the repairs can become quite costly. Thats not to say your ignorant just a word to the wise. ,Volkswagon,cyyabit,1,t5_2qlx1
