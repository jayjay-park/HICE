791721,0,t1_cgr4uo0,gtI heard at meetings that if you chant for good things then you will get them but if you chant for bad things then those things would only happen to you.It sets the stage for the victimblaming we all saw and experienced so much during our tenure in SGI.  If youre going along all fine and then something horrible happens to you count on a lot of whispered gossip about how this is revealing something no one could have expected about you and about your true nature.  If something really bad happens to you the only help youll get from your SGI friends is offers to come over and chant with you.  Then theyll leave all satisfied with a job well done and there you still are perhaps worse off than before because youve just wasted that block of time.The fact that the cult effectively isolates its members through the many mechanisms weve discussed on this subreddit  private language means you can only really communicate with fellow culties socially disapproved of practices hours of chanting recitations of nonsense You must love Daisaku Ikeda above all!!! etc.  means that you very quickly discover just how worthless the good friends of the Mystic Law are.  And how vulnerable you are left now that those useless shmucks are the only friends you have left.,sgiwhistleblowers,cgu9tkl,3,t5_310of

1122677,0,t1_chvuznv,You know in the interest of full disclosure I dont feel I need ANY practice at all.  Though I am generously disposed to the Buddhism of the Pali Canon I feel no urge to practice any of it.  So while I can discuss theoreticals I dont really have a dog in this fight so to speak.  Unless its revealing where what the SGI tells its members and what its members tell each other is actually contradicted by SGIs own sources.  Theres a whole lot of misinformation out there  for example garyp was once saying that the SGI encourages everyone to choose whatever mentor they want.  He did NOT like it when I showed him numerous examples of top leaders insisting that Ikeda was our mentor for life and that Ikeda was the only real choice for mentor.  Stuff like that.I dont need you to agree with me.  I dont need to to make THIS decision or THAT decision or to do THIS or THAT.  I simply enjoy this opportunity to talk about something I cant discuss with anyone I know in real life.  I sent a letter to the SGI demanding that they remove all my personal information from their databases thats what you have to do if you dont want them to continue counting you as a member to inflate their membership statistics.  I dont know any other apostates in real life  my only real opportunity to talk about the development of Buddhism in Japan or the feudal era and the samurai culture or cults in general is here online.  So thanks for the opportunity!!  I will wish you well and support you to the best of my ability no matter what you decide.  The fact that you have engaged and questioned is all I ask of anyone and youve done your part.  Well done sirmadam.  Well done.RE the Lotus Sutra is supreme  in my decades of experience within SGI this concept was used to assure the members that they didnt need to pay attention to any other sutras teachings or other sects of Buddhism.  Nichiren was poisonous in his condemnation of all the other schools of Buddhism and the Lotus Sutra is supreme is used in practice to defend Nichirens extremely unBuddhist behavior.  It was for everyones own good you see that Nichiren attacked all the other sects of Buddhism and implored the government to kill them all because the Lotus Sutra is supreme and those other sects by their very existence were attacking the supreme Lotus Sutra!  Theres no concept of live and let live for Nichiren.This portion is a fundamental and serious departure from Buddhism qua BuddhismgtIts key message is that Buddhahooda condition of absolute happiness freedom from fear and from all illusionsis inherent in all life. The development of this inner life state enables all people to overcome their problems and live a fulfilled and active life fully engaged with others and with society. Rather than stressing impermanence and the consequent need to eliminate earthly desires and attachments the Lotus Sutra asserts the ultimate reality of the Buddha nature inherent in all life.Because it does not stress the elimination of attachments and delusions according to the rules of Buddhism it cant lead people to enlightenment.  According to the rules of Buddhism much suffering arises from the delusion that there are fixed identities a self that separates one from everything else.  Personally I found that whole chant for whatever you want concept to be pernicious as it only served to strengthen my desires and leave me in a state of...Say did you ever read that Shel Silverstein tween book The Phantom Tollbooth?  Damn its not SS  why do I keep thinking its his work??I read it years ago.  One of the only details I remember is that similar to the Wizard of Oz the protagonist passes through different places and meets people doing strange things.  In the one tableau he meets a group of people who are ravenously eating soup.  Its a soup that for every bite you eat you become that much MORE hungry.  Thats how chanting for stuff that didnt come to pass and even stuff that DID turn out as I wanted worked for me.  I developed a wrongheaded view of reality that I could pull strings and direct things by chanting.  This sounds borderline mentally ill doesnt it?  Yet thats the effect of the whole bragging about benefits at meetings and earthly desires are enlightenment and chant for whatever you want and this practice works.gtThe Lotus Sutra is also unique among the teachings of Shakyamuni in that it makes the attainment of enlightenment a possibility open to all people without distinction based on gender race social standing or education. In this way it is seen to be a full expression of Shakyamunis compassionate intention of opening the way to enlightenment to all people.Yet that dismisses and removes Shakyamunis earlier observation that different people need different teachings because their needs are different from each others.  This one teaching fits all is actually far more similar to Christianitys everybody must be saved and acceptjesusastheirpersonalsavior intolerant mindset than Buddhism qua Buddhism.  Considering that the Lotus Sutra is not found before about  CE and even then within the same Hellenized milieu from which Christianity eventually developed it comes as no surprise to me that these two are so very similar in so many of the key features.The Lotus Sutra actually REJECTS a lot of the key concepts that served to make Buddhism unique AND effective from that excerpt you provided.  Im not particularly keen on the Mahayana tradition actually  I am drawn more to Nagarjunas robust philosophy.  And I respect the fact that you may be drawn to the Mahayana tradition  why not?  Were different people!See the problem with the official SGI website on the topic is that I can go through Ikedas guidance or speeches or articles and those of top SGI leaders and find the opposite.  Ill provide  examplesgtPresident Toda used to saygtEveryone casually assumes that the Lotus Sutra indicates the  chapter text by that name. But there are in fact three kinds of Lotus Sutra.gtThe first is the Lotus Sutra of Shakyamuni. This is the  chapter sutra of that name this Lotus Sutra benefited people during Shakyamunis lifetime and during the Former Day of the Law. Presently in the Latter Day however even if you should carry out the practices of the Former Day of reading and reciting this sutra and copying it you will gain no benefit thereby. Our recitation of the Hoben and Juryo chapters during morning and evening Gongyo does not come from this earlier practice  it has a different significance.gtThe Lotus Sutra of the Middle Day of the Law is Tientais Maka Shikan Great Concentration and Insight. The Lotus Sutra for this period of the Latter Day is Nammyohorengekyo the sevencharacter Lotus Sutra hidden in the depths of the Juryo chapter. You need to understand that there are three kinds of Lotus Sutra and how they are related to one another. In addition to these there is another Lotus Sutra that while not capable of being substantiated in a precise historical sense was recognized alike by Nichiren Daishonin Shakyamuni Tientai and Dengyo this is the  character Lotus Sutra expounded by Bodhisattva Fukyo.gtShakyamuni of India taught the  chapter Lotus Sutra for those alive during his lifetime and in the Former Day. Tientai of China expounded the Maka Shikan for human beings of the Middle Day of the Law. And Bodhisattva Fukyo expounded the socalled  character Lotus Sutra for the people of the Middle Day of a Buddha called lonno.gtPresident Toda explained that despite the differences in the age and the form in which the teaching was expressed these are all in fact the same Lotus Sutra. President Toda called the Lotus Sutra as thus conceived the manifold Lotus Sutra. That to me sounds like bullshit.  Theyre just making stuff up to suit themselves. And its fine if it resonates with you  can I stop repeating that now??  When people say Lotus Sutra then what do they really mean??  Nobody clarifies so everybody identifies it differently but theyre all talking about it as if everyone agrees with them.  Christians do this alla time.gtThe five characters of Myohorengekyo which constitute the Lotus Sutras essence  that is Nammyohorengekyo of the Three Great Secret Laws  are the Lotus Sutra appropriate to this age of the Latter Day of the Law. President Toda therefore termed the Daishonins teaching the Lotus Sutra of the Latter Day.And that is blatant misrepresentation.  Toda has reduced Lotus Sutra to a meaningless expression he can apply to anything  as we see below,sgiwhistleblowers,chvwqit,3,t5_310of

1287278,0,t1_ci7htg1,gtgt But just as Kansai was a gimme because that region had historically and traditionally followed the Nichiren schools Brazil was a gimmegt Strong ditto on this!!gt Its exactly the same as my observation! There was this big USBrazil exchange meeting mostly initiated by youth and centered around that huge enthusiastic music performance and celebration of the anniversary of President Ikedas first visit to Brazil some time ago at World Peace Ikeda Auditorium in  before I got really sick with severe depression... It was one of those invitation only meetings and I was hearing about this event from at least two different sources. I could have gone yes I was invited but me my wife and my son decided to rather attend a birthday party of my sons friend another two year old back then... Having heard how great important significant and dynamic this meeting was and I later attended a few other meetings including KRG where membersleaders were sharing their experience of having attended that event I felt sooo bad to have missed that event!! I physically felt so strongly ill and physically felt so strongly disconnected! Not just a mental thing! I was also invited to another of those insiders only meetings a few months earlier which might have had a total impact on my status in the SGIUSA organization... That one might have placed me or considered me as a candidate for one of those national leadership positions in retrospect. Despite their previous generation of national healing arts coleaders repeated advice until even the last moment I didnt attend this specific insiders meeting partly because I had other plans but more because I was a rebel advising them national leaders that they shouldnt be so pushy after having raised me to someday succeed you but they should have given me more advance notice if they wanted me to drive all the way to SGI plaza in Santa Monica from Rancho Cucamonga...Yes I was constantly in communication with these healing arts coleaders for a long time. One of them came to our wedding. The other one was probably talking to me at least once weekly over the phone until the last FNCC meeting in . In  these two coleaders personally told me that they wanted to retire saying that they couldnt be doing this year after year because they were getting old and wanted to really find a capable successor who could replace them. One of the national coleaders gave me a gift of very nice quality beads and both national coleaders and I had a picture of just three of us with me holding that gift of the nice beads! When I didnt go to that particular insider meeting at SGI plaza back in February or so. I felt so disconnected and so left out physically spiritually emotionally and intellectually! I was actually still mainstream and wellconnected at least in appearance at that point in chronological time!gt Kansai oh yes you mean that eternally victorious Kansai josho no Kansai? My fairly until recently WD district leader who happened to even most recently talk anything about gofukei specifically about house fire in relation to gofukei at one of my local groupandup leaders meetings is from Kansai! I now have this feeling that the gofukei mythlegend probably originated in Kansai!! I need to look into this possibility further in more detail!

1519397,0,t1_cj6nhtb,Exactly.  If theyd been smart they would have kept some of that going for the sake of bringing in more youth without whom Das Org cannot survive and creating new more staid and respectable venues where the older members could socialize study discuss.  I remember here in SD one member nice and very handsome gaijin held a private meeting in his gorgeous home to discuss Buddhist theory and the sciences.  He publicized it about  of us showed up and it was terrific!  But that was the end of it.  It SHOULD have been picked up by Das Org but no.  See Ikeda hadnt ordered it.  Therefore it could not be officially done.And when Ikeda took it upon himself to reorganize SGIUSA on the basis of his colossal ego and dim wits the organization collapsed and has not since recovered.  It never will.  Hell never get his hands on another George M. Williams and thats what it took  HE was willing to put himself out there and take chances try new things and it worked.  Now all SGIUSA is ever going to get for leadership is little Japanese Ikeda toadies all bowing and yesmanning for all theyre worth.  And that simply doesnt work in the US.Williams is the one who took it upon himself to schedule promote and deliver lectures on Nichiren Buddhism to major universities in order to attract college students.  Has Danny Nagashima done anything similar?  Nope.  Hes a nice enough fellow and has a nice smile but hes accomplished exactly NOTHING in his  years in office as General Director.  By this time in Williams tenure hed massively increased the SGIUSA membership.  Now SGIUSA leaders are reduced to planning campaigns to increase subscriptions from  to .Subscription numbers are a rough proxy for active members.  That SGIUSA is reduced to only  active members says a lot both about the validity of the new AllIkeda religion its appeal to American members and prospects and Nagashimas effectiveness or lack thereof as the poor menial tasked with the most unpleasant job of trying to recruit more Ikeda admirers.

Sure Ive met a few people who I thought were offthechair types that spouted some pretty cultish sounding things but because SGI is so open to discussion we were able to talk about why we did or did not agree with that person. I think any religious organization can appear cultish because a few individuals speak narrowmindedly and arrogantly about what they think. The reason I like my SGI community is that no one pretends to know all the answers were all learning together and generating discussions about philosophy and how things work for us based on our own experiences and encouraging each other to overcome our daily challenges. Maybe SGI wasnt always like this...I dunno but theyve been a nice warm group of supportive people for more than ten years to me.

And its not any different here in this country either.gt Despite the charade of casting votes there is no way for the people to get their own political mandate into office when they are not permitted to field the candidates of their own choice.Recent studies have shown what we already know  our politicians pay no attention to the will of the voters and instead are beholden only to the political mandates of their rich campaign contributors. The oligarchybigmoney players control who will be allowed to run and voted on for president. Ordinary citizens who cant possibly mount a  billion dollar election fund are automatically omitted from the elections process altogether.  Millionaire Congress Critters regularly grovel for approval from their Israeli masters. The two major political parties serve the very same interests and its not the peoples.

Wars for profit that provide political cover for the looting and murder and mayhem that a bloated militarycorporate monster visits upon millions of innocent peoples in our name. Wars which have created a Culture of War that serves to distract attention away from the  years of covert looting and pillaging of our own countrys wealth by the vampire banksters and corrupted politicians. Democracy? When was the last time you had a chance to vote on going to war for profit or on going into debt to bail out crooked banksters or a serious reduction in military spending?

3291639,0,t1_cp37hzt,Allow me to address your comments point by pointgtFirstly lets look at the question of whether or not the SGI is a democracy. It is easy to say that SGI leaders make the decisions and that members have to comply. To me though this overlooks some important points. Primarily in what way are members forced to comply? No one can deprive you of life liberty or property for not participating in the current campaign at least not without being removed from leadership and facing legal repercussions. Perhaps a person who decides to not do what everyone else is doing will face social disapproval from their peers but show me a group of people where displaying behavior outside the norm isnt met with the same reaction. Peer pressure is one of the primary tools that cults use to encourage compliance from their members. It doesnt take all that long for your social life to rapidly narrow down to your district after you join so those people become incredibly important to you. Part of their charm is that they approve of and love you that will only continue for as long as you dont rock that little boat you dont notice as long as you operate within their parameters. Those wonderful people are one of the things that drew you into the group  you thought you had a common mission and because they apparently are so accepting of you you struggle to understand and accept them too. Its human nature to try and adapt to the group you want to be a part of. And its peer pressure once again that separates you from your life liberty and property you build your life around the org and its members you do what they encourage you to do because you want to fit in and  jeez  dont you want all those benefits and good fortune youll gain by donating whatever you can?Those who demonstrate behavior outside SGIs norm quickly see the harsher side of things I learned that after I was in for almost seven years and disagreed with a couple of leaders about how unkind and disrespectful they were towards a couple of members and had the audacity to speak out about it.And oh my dear you will have no legal recourse. If the egregious Scientologists are bulletproof you better believe that SGI is even more so.gtMoreover leaders that scold members for this reason are acting contrary to the spirit of Buddhism and are destroying the unity of many in body one in mind. On the other hand if a person chooses not to speak out and take action for what they believe is right because they would garner the disapproval of their peers they are doing a disservice to themselves and their peers.Part of the issue is that SGI has nothing to do with actual Buddhism. You can call chicken beef as long as you want but never in its existence did it ever say moo. Do yourself a favor and educate yourself about almost any other tradition Nichiren and its offshoots dont count  there is a world of difference. SGI is about Ikeda at no study meeting will you ever study anything other than his interpretations of Buddhism or Nichirens teachings. You may read a quote or two but its there solely to support Ikedas opinions.gtBut back to the question of whether the SGI is a democracy. Lets look at a district. On the face it might seem that the district leaders are the ones who call the shots and that they simply listen to the direction of the national HQ. This view of the way that districts are run creates a separation between the leaders and the members. Are not the leaders members too? Is there some insurmountable divide between being a general member and being a leader that I am not aware of? Not only are the two equal in stature in the secular realm but the two completely transmigratory. No leaders and members are not equal no matter what you might be told. By the very nature of being places into a leadership position they are automatically imbued with airs of authority and wisdom. Otherwise youd be encouraged to go to peer members for guidance. Its impossible to be appointed a leader and not feel that youre just a little special  otherwise they wouldnt entrust members to your care. Make no mistake the district leaders DO call the shots and they DO simply listen to direction from HQ. I was a leader. gtOne could argue that leaders are appointed by other leaders and as such they do not have the mandate of the people. This argument overlooks that the modern definition of democracy includes forms of government that do not have the general populous directly electing their representative. The point of fact is that leaders are appointed electorally by a group of people who themselves were appointed electorally. This only stops being a democracy when the positions of leadership are unreachable to general members. This however is not the case within the SGI.Im too familiar with occasions where leaders have been absolutely horrible to members and had complaints raised against them. In the worst case that Im aware of the leader was moved to a different part of the state and SGI footed the bill. She maintained her leadership position. And general members will only be considered appointable if they adhere completely to the company line you wont see anyone who asks uncomfortable questions or doesnt attend enough meetings in leadership only those who have pretty much turned their lives over to das org. gtAs to the fact that President Ikeda has been holding his office since the beginning of the SGI this does not affect the standing of SGI as a democracy. Supreme Court Justices hold their office for life. Whats more they are never elected. Great Britain in a similar fashion to many countries around the world is a democracy while at the same time has a figure head whos term is for life power is hereditary and the power fully extends to the nations largest religious organization. If the SGI is not a democracy then all constitutional monarchies are not either.They at least are qualified to one degree or another. Ikeda dropped out of community college to become a collections agent for Toda. Neither of them had a single moment of religious education. Soka Gakkai was not founded to be a religious institution it was the secular arm of one. By the time Ikeda took the helm he was a pure businessman whod developed a somewhat charismatic character. That was it. His purported knowledge of Buddhism is imaginary  again you can never turn a chicken into a cow just by hanging a sign around its neck.Constitutional monarchies do at least hold elections for everyone but the monarchs. They also hold elections and referendums to form legislation only in dictatorships is everything decided by leaders.,sgiwhistleblowers,cp3h1yi,3,t5_310of

3488631,0,t3_30553n,Heres a repost of one of my comments from the original  threadIkeda has clearly indicated his admiration and affiliation with fascism fascism is commonly defined as the merger of corporation and state power. He has set up networks in both the industrial and the political worlds.Ikeda used his Soka Gakkai corporate organizations resources to create and build the powerful Komeito Party which has become the ruling party in Japans congress. Japans constitution forbids religious organizations from being involved in politics. Having successfully circumvented this constitutional law Soka Gakkai is responsible for placing its own political partys members into supreme power and is currently dominating the Japanese government. Soka Gakkai members have also been carefully placed into lower positions of power and control in Japanese society such as courts police and media  all for the purpose of maintaining the SGIs stranglehold over the Japanese political systems.Ikeda  Soka GakkaiIkeda  Komeito Political PartyIkeda a selfdeclared fascist has effectively become the hidden ruler of Japan  the man behind the curtain that controls the political and business direction of Japan. And he intends to create a new Japanese dynasty by placing his son in power when he dies.A quick study of recent Japanese government history will reveal a seemingly unstoppable movement toward a return to fascism. The government wants to expand its military forces far beyond its borders and put an end to defense only military policies in place since the end of WWII. For the first time in  years Japan is beating its war drums again. Tensions military posturing and war rhetoric against China are escalating to dangerous levels and could easily set off another world war. International corporate profits would skyrocket if war is successfully implemented.Ikeda and the SGI have a long record of association with the Japanese mafia. The SGI under the Komeito Party and with the assistance of the corporate yakazuka network have taken control of both corporate and government powers in Japan. The government of Japan is no longer in control of the country. Tepcos handling of the Fukushima nuclear disaster has become a widely known example of uncontrolled corporate power.The entire world is threatened with another imminent accident with removal of fuel rods from the pools in the four fukushima containment buildings destroyed by the tsunami. The government is powerless to control the mighty Tepco corporation and their inept handling of the nuclear disaster. News reports indicate that Tepco is working with the mafia to find homeless people to do cleanup work in the contaminated ruins  leading to deadly radiation exposure for the kind of people least likely to be missed when they die from radiation sickness.In a move that smacks of fascism the Japanese government under the directions of the Ikedas Komeito Party recently passed legislation that makes reporting on Tepco and their nuclear nightmare a criminal activity. Control of the press is essential to a fascist government. Just as Ikedas Komeito had done in Japan our own countrys fascist neocons also have pending legislation in Washington that would criminalize any reporting except governmental approved journalists and reporters. These international fascists also want to place government agents in MSM newsroom editors office to control decisions regarding which news stories get coverage.,sgiwhistleblowers,cppxggk,3,t5_310of

A good example of this phenomenon is the notion that WW was the Good War an idea that was culturally entrenched by Hollywood movies and lingers in the collective psyche of indoctrinated Americans to this day. Im sure that nichiren and the great mongol invasion was ghostproduced as a soka gakkai propaganda piece and I suspect that it was most likely created and financed independently by soka gakkai members with an agenda  to sell the myths as facts.

5127155,0,t3_3l6gtt,Heres the original articleA Journey of Self Discovery By D B Soka Gakkai World Tribune September   Expectations we cant avoid them. Whether we try to live up to them or not is up to us. One of the things we hear in the SGI is that we should reply to President Ikedas expectations. As children we strive to live up to our parents expectations to reply to their love for us. If we are lucky enough to have teachers who care we strive to live up to their expectations. In becoming adults we leave the realm of our parents expectations. As the American poet and author Robert Bly says in Imn John we search for a second father or a second king. Once we leave the realm of our parents expectations whose expectations do we live up to? Our own? Our friends? We tend to set our expectations just within the limits of our comfort zone and do not realize our own potential or genius. It is the mentor who sees the greatness in us that we dont see our selves who spurs us beyond our self prescribed boundaries. Bly says that through a mentor a hint will come to us as to where our genius lies. A mentor helps us rebuild the bridge to our own greatness or essence. As Bly explains living up to the expectations of a mentor is not about pleasing someone else or feeling burdened. It is about the process of selfdiscovery through the mentordisciple relationship. President Ikeda as a mentor and teacher is encouraging us to realize our potential. In early Europe craft guilds were opportunities for youth to leave the realm of their parents and apprentice under master craftsmen and become masters themselves as masons or carpenters. In the artists studios students would paint some of the less important background scenes. Under the guidance of masters of various fields youth developed their skills. In The Human Revolution the character Shinichi Yamamoto representing a young President Ikeda left the realm of his fathers expectations and entered into that of his mentor in life Josei Toda. As depicted in the book Toda visits Shinichis father one day and asks Will you entrust Shinichi to me? After contemplating Todas character and acknowledging Shinichis feelings for Toda his father consents. Toda exclaims How splendid! I Toda will be entirely responsible for Shinichi. Please set your mind to rest vol. pp. . Shinichi chose Toda as his mentor at their first encounter as depicted earlier in the book. It is important to note that the disciple chooses the mentor. A mentor does not recruit disciples or say Follow me? We must see the greatness in the mentor and decide for ourselves. Bly states We can each ask ourselves Is there anyone we know or have heard of who possesses true greatness? If so we should leave with him or her Early in my youth I faced a huge test in my relationship with President Ikeda. I loved him from the first and considered myself his disciple. But I was very young and had no clue about the obstacles that I would face in the future. After a particularly severe set back in my life I felt that I had failed as a disciple. Before I realized it I was overcome with negativity. I have failed him I thought. And my heart broke. I had to think deeply about what he really meant to me. What is a disciple? What does a mentor think about a disciple? I came to understand that I had a very shallow view of the mentordisciple relationship. When I realized that President Ikedas belief in me his belief in my potential was unconditional I was able to pull myself out of the depths of that hell. One reason I like the book The Eternal City is because the mentordisciple relationship between Bruno and his mentor David Rossi is tested. Although he believed himself to be a strong disciple Bruno is forced to wrestle with doubts over his relationship with his mentor. In his case he was faced with doubts about the character of his mentor. In my case I was faced with doubts about my capacity as a disciple. Bruno was also forced to examine his relationship with his mentor on a deeper level. Malicious and false accusations about Rossi had come to Brunos attention while he was in jail. He asked himself Really what kind of man is he? What do I really know about him? Through profound contemplation he awoke to the true character of his mentor and dispelled his doubts. He came to understand what his heart already knew. In my own examination of my relationship with President Ikeda I realized that by assuming that he would give up on me or be forever disappointed in me I was discounting his capacity and compassion. He doesnt expect that we wont stumble at times but he does expect that we will stand back up and carry on. We can get focused myopically on what others think of us. He doesnt believe in me or She doesnt like me or I wasnt appointed this position because they are against me. But we are all comrades in faith standing shoulder to shoulder not front to back following our mentor President Ikeda not one another. Many years ago I happened to be in Tokyo when a journalist was interviewing President Ikeda. TIns reporter was marveling at the extensive organizational powers of the Soka Gakkai. As he was asking President Ikeda how he had achieved this the reporter started describing the typical organizational pyramid  all the members at the bottom and layer upon layer of leaders up to President Ikeda at the top. President Ikeda stopped him and said that is not how he views the Soka Gakkai. He took out a pen and drew a straight line with a point in front of it like this                             o He explained that the line represents all the members of the Soka Gakkai and the point is himself. There is no separation between President Ikeda and each member. He is no closer to top leaders of the organization than he is to the newest member. There is no one between our mentor and us. When we obsess on our organizational position or the opinions of others we are viewing ourselves in that mythical pyramid. President Ikeda has said that he writes so much because one to one dialogue can only reach so many people. I believe that is why SGIUSA General Director Nagashima says that President Ikeda wrote the July  poem Soar Into the Vast Skies of Freedom! Into the New Century to each of us. President Ikeda doesnt write for a mass audience. I think he feels he is indeed writing to touching each of us. I heard the mentor disciple relationship explained once as the mentor being like a transmitter and the disciples like receivers. President Ikeda is always transmitting. It is up to us to receive the message. Several months ago I heard a young woman describe her struggle with the mentordisciple relationship. She was devoted to her practice to kosen Rufu and her members. She was acting as a person of the same mind as the mentor. But although she respected President Ikeda and thought he was a great guy as she put it her heart was closed to him. And this troubled her. She was frustrated by the fact that she just didnt get it. This was some thing she pondered through many prayers. Then one night as she was standing alone out under the stars at the Florida Nature and Culture Center she had an awakening a realization. It was a matter of trust It wasnt President Ikeda it was her ability to open her heart to him. Her father had been a very respected professional but behind closed doors he was an abuser feared by the family. She realized that this was the wall between herself and President Ikeda. All other chanting and prayers had led her to see this and suddenly she got it and tears began to flow down her cheeks. Her receiver was turned on. When a mentor touches our hearts when we are confident that he truly cares for us we are motivated to reply to his expectations. How could you not want to reply to someone who says to you as he once said to me Tell me what I can do for you. I will do anything for you and mean it with all his heart. ,sgiwhistleblowers,cv40j5j,3,t5_310of

5583265,0,t1_cwn1s1a,gtdid you realize that having Okinawa returned to Japan has always been part of the Soka Gakkais political partys platform?huh?? I dont understand.  Okinawa cant be returned to Japan as it is already part of Japan.  Did you mean to say Okinawas US military bases returned to Japan perhaps?  Please clarify for me  Im confused.I would also like to point out that in the s SGI used to boast of having onethird of Okinawans as members which supposedly qualified the island as having achieved some sort of model of local kosen rufu? I think its likely that the SGI had to kowtow to Okinawan members political sentiments against the US bases to attract and mollify such large a segment of the islands population still a large number of members even if the membership numbers were exaggerated  which we know they always were especially back then. I also think that the prolonged suffering of Okinawans in the post WW period contributed to SGIs success at recruiting there. The same boom in membership numbers due to postwar hardships in Japan was even more pronounced intensified and prolonged in Okinawa. I remember a chapter chief that I knew in Okinawa telling be about his participation in one of the human chain of protesters around Kadena AFB.  I had assumed he had joined in the protest on his own violition but looking back and thinking about it more I see where the local gakkai leaders could have been cursorily supportive of the Okinawan Islanders passion for protesting US military bases on their island.  But I seriously doubt that the Sokagakkai itself was responsible for doing any of the heavy lifting required to organize any of those human chain protests or any other antimilitarywar protests in Okinawa. How is it that after so many Okinawans chanting for the removal of US bases for over sixty something or more years that there has been NO success at all?  Could it be that chanting does not work?   Hmmm.Sokagakkais political machinations differ so highly in Japan as compared to the SGI orgs that dot in the rest of the world. I defy anyone to come up with one single instance of the SGIUSAs or NSAs official encouragement or support of members to participate in antiwar protests or demonstrations here in this country. And the same difficulty goes for finding any active antiwar SGI org other than in Okinawa which possibly seems to be the sole exception to the SGIs usual lack of a real antiwar stance. The SGI doggedly sticks to its old saw  the only efforts that count in creating world peace are efforts made toward converting new members or supporting the cult.orgs activities and goals.     ,sgiwhistleblowers,cwp5mau,1,t5_310of

THIS is where the REAL money lies.  They just have to get enough people donating to keep up the facade that they get donations from the members  since most countries have a separation of church and statetype approach there will be no audits no scrutiny of money that is designated from donations.And in each of these moneylaundering destinations where this dirty money is used to buy up pricey real estate cultural heritage locations artworks etc. they simply need to maintain enough members on the books to make it look like this is all justified  because its for the members you see.

I still wonder if Ikeda wasnt assigned to Toda to keep an eye on him and report back to the boss on Todas activities.  I mean his first publishing venture postprison was PORN and the Soka Gakkai was recruiting heavily from prostitutes  two of organized crimes most obvious territories.Also oddly I noticed a source that recounted how the Soka Gakkai invited outsiders to contribute fundsinvest for the ShoHondos construction.

But we dont.Soka Gakkai members more likely to report having no friendsSoka Gakkai members more likely to be divorced not employed fulltime living far from family and where they grew upSGI members place lower value on marriage childrenThe Soka Gakkais entrenched misogynyIts imperative that one choose wisely as it appears that ones choice of religion defines ones financial destiny  Look carefully at everyone who practices that religion.  If theyre poor its extremely likely that their choice of religion particularly if theyre devout is contributing to that.  For example an yearlong study found that those who  regularly attended church in young adulthood were  more likely to be obese by middle age than their peers who did not attend church.All that time spent chanting reciting the sutra etc. is unavailable to improve your life.  If youre spending it chanting reciting etc. you cant spend it getting extra rest enjoying familyfriends and strengthening those healthenhancing bonds taking classes to improve your educational qualifications taking on an extra project at work for advancement enjoying a favorite hobby or even just getting some exercise.  All this DOES have an impact down the road and contributes to why those you see doing your same practice and not thriving in life are so bogged down  theyre wasting their time on something that does not contribute to advancement in ANY area of life.  So watch out!Study shows Soka Gakkai members less well off financiallyThe Soka Gakkai likes to claim that its members are well off professionally employed highly educated  the opposite is the truthBut if you want to join the ranks of Soka Gakkai members who are far less satisfied with life generally knock yourself out!,sgiwhistleblowers,d1ghuou,2,t5_310of

7512111,0,t3_4h5ddh,That is because small religious groups are not automatically deserving of the pejorative connotations that the word cult lends them. Throughout the s and onwards the word cult took on a pejorative unscholarly and biased connotation from anticult groups which made a lot of money by pandering to the fear people had of these new religions this was the first time many had even heard of hinduism buddhism and Islam  or any of the philosophical and religious beliefs these carried.New Religious Movement therefore is a perfectly valid way to describe more recent religious groups and to differentiate them from the older primarily Abrahamic religions.

10167089,0,t3_5lgyfo,Happy New Year! Welcome to the sub and thanks for sharing your story predicament with us. Its obvious that what youve been going through has been very difficult and stressful. You probably never dreamed or expected that things would go down this way for you. I believe youre just beginning to see the bigger picture about the Ikeda cult. However the gakkai rabbit hole runs deeper and in more directions than you or I can imagine. But Im sure youve become very familiar with the cult ripples that strike closest to home.You really hit on a lot of important points.gtMy spouse is in SGI and is pretty into it. In fact its how we originally metI assume it was your spouse that was already in the cult.org when you met  and was the one who recruited you into the cult.  Amirite?gtI left after a couple years of realizing more and more how weird things are with Ikeda and the whole Nichiren Shoshu thing...Was there any particular point or event that acted as a catalyst or trigger which heavily influenced you to begin taking off the rosecolored glasses and questioning the absurdities?gtthe billions in assets for aggrandizement of Ikeda all safe due to nonprofit status.Now youre starting to hit the nail on the head. However Ikedas level of corruption runs much deeper than most suspect. For instance have you looked into any of the evidence that confirms the SGI is deeply connected to the yakuza Japanese mafia? There are a number of threads here on that subject. gtI pretty much ignore it because it only causes fights and problems if I try to question anything about it and it seems mostly harmless Im concerned that you dont see what youre saying there is contradictory and could be viewed as a red flag warning. Please pause for a moment and think about it  anything that is causing fights and problems in your relationship is NOT mostly harmless. That sounds alarmingly similar to the sort of statements abuse victims typically use to downplay defend or dismiss controlling and abusive behavior inflicted by their sociopath spouse. Although youve made some substantial progress in seeing past the cult facade its possible you might still be in denial about a few other cultrelated problems. gtother than the contribution and I think we only give a couple hundred a yearI think??? You dont know? It would wise to keep up with that yearly donation figure. What if your spouse suddenly decided to increase her donation pledge without your knowledge or consent. Unfortunately such things do occur quickly driving a huge nail in the relationship coffin. gt showed up after they had done gongyoThats a wise choice  no need for you to sit through the cults hypnosisinducement rituals.gtIts just crazy that these people buy into it thoughMembers buy into the cult.orgs attractive sales pitches. In order to establish and reinforce cult control while also ensuring they continue as return buyers members are subjected to both mass hysteria and induced insanity. Mass Hysteria is generated by the cult over either Glorious Leader cue  Ikeda Show or the excommunication event cue Soka Spirit hate group. However mass hysteria eventually wears off as it overloads the emotional circuitry of the target audience members soon become desensitized to the triggers used to generate mass hysteria and it takes heavier and heavier doses of cult propaganda to maintain the feverishly herdinducing hysteria. Eventually the members habituate to the stimulus indoctrination and become exhausted by the hysteria.Induced Insanity on the other hand is not an emotional state. It is a state of mind and a state of perception that filters and interprets inputs to produce the desired output  an acceptance of insanity as normal and good. It is the normalization of induced cult mindset and identity.gt it can be a great and supportive communityOnly for as long as you or your spouse remain evaluated as a member in good standing. IF you both leave the community support along with those members you thought were your friends will very quickly evaporate away. This is behavior which we have seen and documented time and time again.gtits just so obviously a religious corporation...The key word here is corporation  an entity that basically only exists to sell productsservices but whose primary function is to increase corporate profits and salaries. On the other hand the SGIs charlatan new age religion serves as a convenient front business excellent for covering up corruption international moneylaundering smuggling and other criminal activities.  gtIts always kind of weird being in a room as the sole nonmember but I also kind of like it and feel a good sense of defiance.I can relate to enjoying a sense of defiance.  Over a thirty year period I left and returned on a number of occasions. I was a senior leader who resigned position and left. When I returned I proudly defied being sucked in with leadership appointments. I instigatedsupported certain rebellions in the YMD ranks.  I remember thinking that my shield of defiance would insure protection for me against getting burned yet again by the cult.org  but I was wrong. My defiance couldnt prevent the SGI from fucking me up time after time and in so many various ways that I never expected.gtI was part of this too then made a conscious decision to abandon it for good reasons.Good for you!  Kudos on coming to your senses sooner rather than later. The tragic part is... your spouse is still in. I really hope things work out for you I dont doubt that youve been fighting hard to prevent your relationship from being damaged any further by the cult.org. gtIm happy to have caused even a rippleI understand. Thats why Im willing to contribute my time and effort to being active in this community. Collectively we have created some significant ripples. Each and every person that is helped along by our efforts to expose the SGI brings forth a deeply satisfying feeling of justice and joy within me. It is truly beautiful to see a person reject enslavement empower themselves regain their ability to think clearly reestablish their own identity and rediscover their lost freedom and heartbreaking to see families and lives being ruined the SGI cult. gtassuming one of the more influential Japanese SGI matrons doesnt try to convince my spouse to divorce a heretic like meThats not an impossibility but its more likely they are plowing your spouse with guidance to play the long game. The will try to convince your spouse to resolve to keep chanting for you to fall back in line no matter how long it takes. They will patiently work for years even decades to break down your resistance. And they will quite often succeed  something Ive seen happen again and again.gteveryone seems so normal otherwise which is almost more sinister because they are all just the willing products of a hundred billion dollar personality cult. An astute observation indeed! The normal part makes it very difficult to recognize whats being kept hidden beneath the shiny veneered surface. The SGI is very adept at convincing their mentally enslaved members to LOVE their servitude to the cult.org. ,sgiwhistleblowers,dbwhui1,3,t5_310of

So theyre still doing body count.  Thats what I called it when I was being pressed to make a shakubuku goal my first yearfirst August shakubuku campaign.  I said then and I maintain now that it is disrespectful and strange to declare how many people youre going to convince to sign up.  What if it isnt right for them?  What if you dont run into any people who want that?Do you think this is a realistic goal?  Are there that many people in Brazil who are interested in this weirdo Japanese cult do you think?  Do Brazilian SGI members attempt to recruit with the same You can chant for whatever you want lure that they use in the USA?  Lets see  if Brazil has  members out of a population of over . million that means  of .  And Ill bet you that  is inflated by   Ill bet the real core is more like .  Thats how the statistics are massaged in SGIUSA.  Do you have any idea what the subscriptions numbers are?  Because that is the best proxy for the active membership numbers which in SGIUSA are limping along around .  They even make out membership cards for a members nonpracticing family members or roommates all for the sake of padding the membership so that Sensei will think there are more devotees here than there actually are!Ive found evidence that foreign locations were directed to convert  of the population  In the USA and Brazil the two strongest SGI colonies they arent even close.  Their most inflated estimates only amount to th of  and the reality is only th of that.   per district!  Oh THATs not ambitious AT ALL is it??  See in Japan when Ikeda took over and changed everything around to his liking the numbers started dropping off.  By  he had acknowledged that  families had abandoned the Soka Gakkai and admitted that the SGs growth phase was ended.  But he still thought that some basic momentum would persist like interest on a savings account or something.  Ikeda expected to take over the government of Japan by   That was the th anniversary of something or other Nichiren.  Instead he was stripped of his Sokoto head of all lay organizations title forced to resign and publicly apologize and forbidden from speaking in public for  years.  So then Ikeda was confident that hed be able to take over Japan by   And he got excommunicated instead!  Dude is just astonishingly clueless about reality!gtA fact about the SGI is that if they set a numerical goal they then report that they have achieved it  and then nobody can ever replicate the feat!!  This is a historical pattern within the Soka GakkaiSGI SourceThe Soka GakkaiSGI has been claiming the same  million members worldwide figure since at least .  Can you spell stagnation?  And thats at best  here in the US  of everyone who ever tries it quits  and the ones willing to try it are a miniscule minority out of the population in the first place.  A  retention rategt Gohonzon were handed out by NSASGI in the United States. Only  members are locatable with  active. ...only  of the people receiving Gohonzon still practiced...Even that  active is overstated the actual number  for the entire USA  is closer to   Subscriptions are a proxy for active membership in  the SGIUSAs national goal was to increase subscriptions from  to  even if that meant every member of a family getting their own subscription or each person in a couple getting their own or people buying extra subscriptions to give to family and friends like they want that obnoxious dreck!.  And as with every numerical goal SGIUSA claimed theyd attained it  the exact number!Analysts were noting from the beginning how the Soka Gakkai wildly inflated its membership numbers.  When our former General Director George M. Williams ne Masayasu Sadanaga released reports of  members to the news outlets that led to several stories on the fastest growing religious movement in America and all sorts of other favorable publicity.  Shrewd tactic.Once I started learning about the history of the Toda time period over in Japan I was flooredgtCoincidentally Todas Great March of Shakubuku when his Soka Gakkai managed to convert  households or so they say no independent audit of records was ever done began in  and concluded with Todas death in  so it included the time period of this drug epidemic  and the Soka Gakkai was recruiting from the exact stratum of society where the epidemic hit hardest the dislocated disenfranchised poor and less educated. SourceThe Soka Gakkai also recruited prostitutes who served the US military bases and were considered the backbone of the postwar recovery Japanese economy  Most of the war brides who started the SGI movement in the US were likely former prostitutes who were the rejects of Japanese societygtOthers complain about how the organization extracted their money. Were literally their little worker bees. Were collecting all their little money all their little honey for them and we gladly give it over.I read that same article  by someone with a hyphenated last name  Diane HoneymanBlondel I think?  gtThe apex of the impertinence for me was when in the middle of those churchy talks constantly I had to hear Hey you dont talk very much why are you this way?  Seriously I had to take deep breaths in order to act serenely.One critic of the Soka Gakkai referred to their discussion meetings as intensive indoctrination courses  and youve experienced it firsthand.  Not only are the people there guided on what to believe theyre pressured to adopt a certain type of behavior as well.  You have to speak up!  You have to participate in the discussion!  You have to smile OO  If you dont youll be criticized.  This is the subtle counterpart to lovebombing.  And of course when you adjust your behavior to their expectations youll be rewarded by smiles affirmations encouragement and acceptance.  If you havent seen this episode of the comedy show Everybody Loves Raymond the tall brother gets involved with a cult  and Im certain the cult is based on SGI down to fruit on the altar in the background.  Also toward the end the dad insults the brother by calling him Dalai as in Lama so theres clearly some referenceconnection to Buddhism involved in this depiction.,sgiwhistleblowers,dgkdbtl,1,t5_310of
