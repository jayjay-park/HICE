3952715,0,t1_cr6tze0,Well I can gladly say Im no longer tilted by it. I just tilted super hard for the  hours after I busted when I wrote this post because I keep getting so close to huge scores and bricking. My mental game has been pretty solid and Ive endured multiple  buyin downswings over k hands with minimal negative effects and Ive never felt even close to how tilted I was yesterday. Just need to stop playing MTTs I guess. When I feel like playing cash Ill jump back into NL and work my way up,NerdRollChallenge,cr6ud40,2,t5_37b2r
