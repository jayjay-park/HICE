5369413,0,t1_cvu6smx,Its a special sort of naivety  teenage cynicism for cynicism sake  to think real numbers do not matter and that people you met are valid representation.Lets start with the fact that if you dont speak Russian youve probably talked with people fluent in foreign language so its intellectuals and young people. Its definitely not a majority and not people Lukashenko cares much about.,belarus,cvy03z2,2,t5_2r2ad
5379048,0,t3_3o3qct,In Poland the same postsoviet people are ruling the country for about years and the current election system after systematic degradation is much worse than it was in the beginning in  mainly by adding the possibility of corrupt remote voting from homes. Poles dont have any control of their votes neither on the whole process of preparation and maintaining the elections. The final idiotic results usually appear after weeks of very suspicious and secret counting procedures and while kk of votes are officially considered as fake without any investigation like it was recently one year ago the polishsoviet politicians ignore the problem using their favorite logic argumentum ad ignorantiam because by our universal democratic law all votes have to be destroyed immediately after elections. The west simply cannot fight against Lukashenko nor Putin because our democracy is a double edged sword that could very badly hurt the USrael hegemony of the world! Belarus North Korea China Russia etc they know it and by organizing this kind of elections ceremonies they are clearly laughing at our faces because western multiculti people are just too stupid and too naive to understand the reality!,belarus,cvz8fet,1,t5_2r2ad

As far as I know the only working and legal way is to use Western Union or any other direct money transfer that operates in both countries,belarus,d4v2s65,3,t5_2r2ad
