It may be the first full show uploaded to YouTube though in it they directly reference the cinema edition episode so I think thats the first full one on YT but there were plenty of episodes that took place before that. Some snippets of them are online  uploaded to YouTube on th Feb   the Muslum caller video uploaded to YouTube st March   earthquake scene described by Richard on May nd as being from one their very first showsFor a long time I thought that May st WAS their first show because its reported as such on several sites plus its recorded in Stevens house and has a different look from the rest of the shows. It was only after some digging around that I discovered a number of missing episodes took place before it. Its a real shame.,Jesus_Chatline,d3p17kd,1,t5_39i1a
