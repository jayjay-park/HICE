5467107,0,t3_3pv33f,Guess I should do the introduction stuff too. Do you use a calorie counting app? If so what is your username?I got MFP since everyone raved about it so much on the weightloss subs.  Username  SynkittenI was a little leery of it at first but once I discovered the barcode scanner I pretty much fell in love.  I love that I dont have to use google to hunt down calorie counts for things.  I dont use it for much more than logging calories mostly because Im too anxious to make friend requests or put myself out there but maybe knowing people can see and judge my terrible eating habits will help with motivation to continue improving? What are your goals for this challenge?My weight loss goal is pretty much consistent and ideally rapid loss of weight.  Getting to or preferably below  would probably be the first major milestone number for my journey and I think I can probably manage that before the challenge ends? What are you planning on doing to accomplish these goals?Eating less and walking more mostly.  My fitbit has become another limb just like my headphones.  In a perfect world I might be able to swim laps if the pool stays open in winter and is cheap or try the local gym if I can get the balls to do it.  I cant decide whether I need a firm kick in the ass or someone to hold my hand and soothingly drag me inside.  Probably both. Why did you sign up for this challenge?To be honest I joined the challenge less for my weight loss goals and more to force myself to interact with people.  I absolutely want to lose weight but its nice to hear from other people who are motivated on attainingmaintaining their goals.  I dont have anyone around me that really gets what Im doing or why.  Im not particularly outgoing or social but sometimes even introverts would like having someone to talk to. How are you feeling?If I were completely honest here my comment would turn into a complete downer but I guess Im just anxious in general.  On the upside I dont have to worry about holiday treatsdesserts because Im the only one who makes them and Im not baking treats for anybody who doesnt deserve them myself included.As far as ideas maybe when theres a lot of people here Im being optimistic there could be a friendlist thread specifically for listing usernames and maybe stats for all the fitnessrelated places?  Im one of those people who likes lists and having things categorized and colorcoded rather than skimming through pages of information though so its really up to everyone whether theyd be interested.,TeamGingerbread,cwah3c0,9,t5_3ag92

5558105,0,t1_cwlxahh,Thanks! Eating out is tough since Im eating at nonchain restaurants so the calories are always an estimation. Hopefully sticking to lean proteins nothing fried and avoiding creamy sauces and cheese will be good enough! ,TeamGingerbread,cwm18cy,1,t5_3ag92
5623724,0,t3_3s5ap7,My running has been going all right. I had to take another rest break to heal my shin splints. This week will be tough since Im traveling for work ThursMon and itll make finding time to run incredibly difficult. Not to mention rain earlier this week isnt helping. I was hoping to be done with CK this week or next but its looking like I might be a week behind that.Im feeling good about my runs. I have yet to run any longer than  minutes so  minutes seems a little daunting but I am sure that I will be able to push through it. Every run goes a little better than expected even if that means they are slow. CK keeps me accountable. Fitness goals make me stay on top of my weight loss goals. I think it will really help throughout the winter challenge especially as I am bound to eat more than my daily allotted calories  is so few! for several days during the holiday season. The running will at least give me a few hundred spare calories to work with.,TeamGingerbread,cwu6d7d,4,t5_3ag92
