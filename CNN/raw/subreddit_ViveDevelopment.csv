You do that in VR by opening the system menu clicking the gear icon choosing chaperone from the lefthand categories and setting it to developer mode.  I dont know how to turn it off completely though.And Unity is irrelevant here as its a feature of SteamVR itselftheres no way to write a game which will override the users settings and disable their chaperone. I hope its obvious why thats a good thing.,ViveDevelopment,d3c1i1f,1,t5_3a6bq
