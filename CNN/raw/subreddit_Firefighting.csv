There are cars out there where even a slight difference which is not necessarily visible from the outside means that some critical components are at a completely different location.We once had an extrication call where all information available to us on the cars model left us with  possible locations for the battery. We had a technician from a licensed dealer on the phone and still couldnt get any more precise info Of course the battery was in the location we looked last under the rear seats if I remember right because we were told that would be the least likely location.Thats why Id prefer to have the relevant information carried in every car.

Fit tested N with charcoal filters Yes in your bag. Mouthtomask pocket mask Maybe. A BVM is preferred but it makes sense to have one in the bag anyway. Alcohol based hand sanitizer In the bag or truck sure. We have dispensers mounted in our rescues so its always available.  If your department is going to mandate this then mandate wearing gloves on every call and eye protection and an N when you need them.

They are still primed to burn and when they do they are rebuilt the same way  without sprinklers. It is going to take many generation before the fire hazard in all of those homes disappears. Back to the liability thing commercial sprinkler systems have been a thing for a long time. The only time they seem to be a problem is when a human breaks a sprinkler. I dont think I have ever seen a system just start spraying water. What I have seen though is a lot of fires that have been contained by the system. These are fires that would have grown to cause major fire loss had the system not been installed.

1840287,0,t3_2fnmlf, min bottles work fine for us. We have enough staffing and enough companies that we can rotate crews rapidly if we need to. And most of the time one or two bottles is all you need. The majority of our fires are single family dwellings and theres no need for the extra air. For highrise fires we stage spare bottles a couple of floors below. For our purposes  min bottles work fine. The extra size and weight of a larger bottle isnt worth it. If I worked for an agency with different staffing levels I might consider otherwise. But it works for us. Rit packs have sixty min bottles. Hazmat rigs carry s.On a related note when I started it was common to see guys use their bottles sparingly. Going inside and waiting until they cant take it anymore before masking up or performing roof ops without going on air. Those days are over. Yes we go through more bottles but thats what theyre there for. ,Firefighting,ckay93j,4,t5_2ray9

2221823,0,t1_cllzn6f,Seems like our departments might be handling the incidents a bit different. Typically on residential fires we only have two modes of operation. Offensive and defensive. Either you attack the fire and fully extinguish it or you let it burn and mop up afterwards. This of course doesnt apply to commercial buildings.Here we have no physical means of locating a way back. Departments can deploy tag lines but other than the attack lines there is nothing always in place. Truck operations with search teams will often operate without any physical means of egress other than where they entered and what they can find. So your search teams branches off of the engine attack team? If the engine crew is searching what is the truck crew doing? Who handles  ladders and ventilation? Im unfamiliar with the term SCBA team. Not everyone using a BA?My area contains a lot of multistory aprtments. Commonly refered to as garden style apartments. Although the center stairwell can create a chimeny of sorts its usually negated by having top floor occupants close their doors and wait for a rescue from the patio via ladders. The advantage of the front door attack in this style of building is it allows less hose movement and the ability to advance to the next floor. Entering the subdivision window would greatly hinder that. Here not every team is bringing a hose line. We can dedicate crews to just searching venting forcing doors controlling utilities RIT ect ect.This offered a better idea of how two countries obtain the same goal.,Firefighting,clm8wg8,2,t5_2ray9

Mining style cap lamps are great in that theyve got a really long life tough as fuck theyre all intrinsically safe but they generally need a bracket and are intended more for work. Theyll fall off too easily but theyve got a cord so they wont go far...but they can also get caught on things. And the battery needs to be mounted on a belt and theyre usually rechargeable rather than able to take a fistfull of AAs. Theyll cut through smoke decently if held low.

4506708,0,t3_3cpdb6,. I didnt grow up wanting to be a FF  I got my EMT when I was  and wanted to apply it locally and it only made sense to go FFEMT..  as above. Were a mostly urban fire district  but we cover a lot of open ground and so we probably get almost as many brush fires as structural but nothing in the forest.. As a volunteer its  hours a month usually in two  hour shifts. We man the quarters so we dont have anybody respond POV. A typical day will be rig checks station maintenance training for  hours mandatory and then whatever is the daily task. Calls as we get them but we sit at an avg of . calls a day or something like that so we fill the time with training. We also have part timers that I think have to do also  hours. Residents work   on  off.. Ive always been partial to EMS. Theres a certain amount of fun fighting fire but I approach it as a business thing rather than an adrenaline thing. Rolling up to a fire I know my job and I execute. I pay more attention to efficiency and safety than anything else. My adrenaline comes in getting a call for trauma. I think the body is an incredible thing and Im no longer grossed out. Had a pt with a leg going  different directions and afterwards I just said it was the coolest thing and thought about all the fun stuff the ortho folks at the hospital were going to do to fix it. Ive got a more healthy respect for mortality after doing separate transports for hospice patients. Since I still have an office job to pay the bills Ive had to learn to reign in my thirst to talk about all my FireEMSSAR stories because its either not interesting to them or grosses all my coworkers out. I also have much more respect and admiration for other first responders and am constantly saddened by how people take for granted what all the agencies do for them. Im disgusted by the idea that people think calling an ambulance isnt worth the nonexistent bill unless transport and that were some extension of the police and can lock people up....,Firefighting,csypyn6,1,t5_2ray9

Talk with  of the people who work for the Forest Service and they would agree with you whole heartedly that the past policies of  suppression and the current policies of impeding thinning and burning programs have devastatingly added to the threat of large wildfires but there are very few people internally who are supporting these policies any more. Most of the push back on thinning and burning programs come from outside the agency from organization like the Sierra Club. Dont get me wrong I think they believe they are doing what they think is best for the land and for people but they usually have very little scientific evidence to support what they believe is right.

You could have a entire hotshot crew on a single stump which Ive seen before. Fire got called in hotshot crew was training nearby they did a full line dig around it for laughsBut Id say in a typical IA situation at least on our forest with a single tree youd see ONE resource on it so one engine or an patrol resource or one small squad.

And on weekdays we usually had drills andor training. If you had the  to  watch you might get an hour down before next watch. But usually  hours of sleep. At sea was alright though because I was in engineering and you couldnt do maintenance because everything was running unless it broke. In Port we had  hour duty every  days. You stood   hour watches. Say  to  am and then same thing pm. Typically got  to  down usually broken. And then you worked every weekday.  hours was normal but more was more typical. Youd be lucky to get  days off a week. Id say an easy week was  hours but  was about average. Worked a few  to  hours a week normally when the ship was drydocked. And people wonder why I turned down a  grand reenlistment bonus to reenlist for  years . I made that up in less time as a civilian making more money anyway.So yeah I wasnt being shot at and had a very low risk of dying even though it is considered dangerous work. I never felt in danger. But getting shot at is just one of many stressors in the military. Mine was more typical. Being overworked underpaid  and treated like a number running me like equipment that you run to fail and replace with something new.  Oh and command climate was pretty bad. Lots of workplaces have bad leaders and lots of people cant quit a shitty workplace because they have mouths to feed. But in a civilian job they typically dont throw you in jail if you decide to quit because the stress is affecting your physical and mental health. Dont get me wrong. Im not trying to have a passing contest. My situation was really abnormal.

9231592,0,t3_56t8us,I have linked the starting strength calculatorspreadsheet that I use. If you do not know your  rep maxes for the basic lifts spend one day at the gym finding them then subtract lbs and enter those numbers in the yellow boxes under test weight. Its not rocket science and you dont need to be deadon accurate. Just get a decent starting point for each of the lifts and stay committed. Workout as much as you can. Mix in cardio but not longdistance stuff. Do interval sprints sprint rows etc. Also if you do nothing else pack a backpack  lbs and start walking up and down stairs. We racked up around  flights in our first week in academy.Pushup  yes situps eh runeh. Yes we did all . But it was a    split between those. We spend much more time dragging tires running up and down the training tower with hose bundles sprints burpees etc than long distancesteady state cardio. There just isnt time for that. They  have to get a hard workout in a short time. Good luck.BTW I have ff friends who came in through academy with me who were lbs soaking wet and ended up doing better physically than some of the guys. Technique is everything. Forcing a door may not be as easy to do for you vs. the lb brute dude using raw power but on the other hand the techniques they teach level the playing field a whole damn lot. He isnt going to be much more effective on a haligan than you are IF you learn to use it right and gain a baseline strength that you can utilize while exicuting technique. Are you going to flip that same dude over your shoulder in full bunker gear and carry him out of the fire? No. But theyll teach you and everyone else to throw a loop of webbing under their arms over your head and drag that heavy mofo out. Technique trumps a whole lot. Not everything but male or female if you arent some jacked gymjockey with a handlebar stache weighing in at  of lean mean muscle machine technique and efficiency are your friends and will take you far possibly farther than mr.  when he blows a shoulder forcing a door like heman.,Firefighting,d8m674w,7,t5_2ray9

9562927,0,t3_5bvgp7,. In my area rescue is an ambulance. In others rescue is a toolbox on wheels. Technical confined space anything complicated. . Usually driver or driver operator. Varies . Any air horn is effective if used worth a dam on any apparatus . Not necessarily . Priming gets air out of the system and the pump. We only really prime if we are drafting. Some departments prime EVERY TIME.  drafting or you have drained water from the pump housing. Typically only seen in cold climates. . We dont have excessive pressure buildup  close the bale fast and we have water hammer. Thats bad. That will break or burst things. It depends on what the panel and engineer are doing. If pumping in PSI the pressure governor will adjust automatically. The relief valve might open and attempts to do something with the excess until the pump catches up.

Downstairs isnt involved and the quick application of water in the attic via hooking the ceiling should knock a lot of that down pretty quickly.  About  seconds in no and if a crew were interior Id pull them out if the fire started popping out of all sides of the attic like that.  With modern gussetplate truss roofs the whole thing may come down around your ears in a hurry.  I know Im going to get yelled at for being aggressive I dont mind.   It appears the flow path is keeping the ground level pretty clear so you should have some clear space to work in so youve got a chance of saving the front few rooms and at least doing a primary search.
