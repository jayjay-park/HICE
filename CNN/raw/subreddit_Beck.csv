360536,0,t3_1y6b80,Unforgiven  Dont Let It Go are two of the best new songs. Ive been listening to them for a while because beck premiered them at that concert at the rio theatre last year. Im still really bummed out that Evil Things got left out,Beck,cfi4w3c,1,t5_2s2su

1866897,0,t3_2fzapb,On Mellow Gold this song is before Nitemare Hippy Girl I often wondered if Steal My Body Home is also about the Nitemare Hippy Girl. One of the songs lines is I got sucked inside of her apartment.,Beck,cke5lj3,2,t5_2s2su

5630720,0,t1_cwuuiev,Yeah I would love to have the minute extended versions that came with the  singles of those but theyre unfortunately quite expensive at this point. Oh well the iTunes versions will do ,Beck,cwv1lom,2,t5_2s2su

10236561,0,t3_5ln2yd,Okay heres the scoop. The guy who owns this shared this with me a few years ago and I shared it in a few places. He was cool with it and I appreciate his generosity. Ill post a link for download later today. That said heres whats up with itThis is an unmastered unfinalized copy of the album. The sequence of songs is mostly the same apart from High  and Readymade being reversed. Computer Rock isnt present and some of the tracks havent been completely edited so there is a little more session audio at the beginning of Ramshackle and a hint of noise at the beginning of The New Pollution. Apart from the album being unmastered which is really nice due to concerns about stuff being overly loud in later remasters and such the alternate mixes of Novacane and Sissyneck are great. Novacane has a lot of samples which were removed and replaced by rerecorded bits that sound similar and Sissyneck includes the talking Barbie snippets which Beck mentioned in an interview. The Barbie samples were an issue for Mattel if I remember correctly as they wouldnt clear them. The other samples went uncleared because the label didnt want to pay extra.There is also a version of the album that was finalized that includes the original versions of Sissyneck and Novacane. Promo tapes of this version were distributed internally a while before the album was released though I dont know how long before. It was labeled Odelay on those tapes Devils Haircut was labeled Electric Music in the Summer People IN THE not AND THE and Minus was subtitled Karaoke Bloodperm. I own one of those tapes and will post a rip of it with the unmastered CD too.UPDATE Heres the download link its live for  days ,Beck,dc4ddmz,2,t5_2s2su

10837582,0,t3_5uxxy3,This is a legitimately great album. It doesnt exactly sound like a Beck album despite he wrote the majority of it and produced it along with his band though I think thats because he wrote a lot of it for Charlotte as opposed to himself. He probably consulted with her about what the sounds should be about and this is confirmed for the title track at the least.His contributions to Stage Whisper are similarly great although listening to a song like Terrible Angels explains why it didnt appear on IRM. Its more of a Beck song than a Charlotte song.The collaboration here reminds me that just because you didnt write the song it doesnt make the performance or person performing and less worthy of the credit as the main performer. This was looked at as an issue in the nineties but it seems to have reversed again. Ill definitely check out Charlottes next album whenever it comes whether Beck is involved or not. Shes a talent.,Beck,ddxtix0,3,t5_2s2su

11347932,0,t3_61uu6k,Nobodys Fault But My Own always gave me a George Harrison Beatles vibe most likely due to the fact it also has a sitar and nothing else really. Still one of my top favourites I think. This survivor has been so tough!,Beck,dfi9n2k,2,t5_2s2su
