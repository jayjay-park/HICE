9860966,0,t1_daqucp3,Ok. So I went today and although the camp is very organized it doesnt seem to be organized from outside sources so much. In other words its difficult to find the people in charge that are associated with places outside of the camp itself. So basically if you bring the supplies to camp they would be able to get where they need to go. But I had trouble finding out if there was anywhere or anybody outside of the camp at a physical address that could be sent items.  There is churches in Mandan and Bismarck that may be willing to deliver items mailed or sent to them. The Unitarian Universalists in Bismarck is very active with the camp. I dont know specifically if they receive items but I know they delivered a check we got to them. I hope this helps. Ive left the camp but I may be able to investigate more if you need me to.,Standing_Rock,daswns8,1,t5_3hpwb

I bet if Trump attended a standing rock protest he would change his mind in minutes. He would really see how much this affects these people.,Standing_Rock,ddfgtel,1,t5_3hpwb
