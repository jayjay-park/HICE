4432217,0,t1_csoj1ny,gt Yeah if you want to swap samples those are the bottles you need. Some people also use shrink wrap I use it to seal the bottles. Helps prevent the caps becoming unscrewed.Great advice sir! As far as the legality goes any tips for bypassing Texas shipping laws?gt Also make sure you read the rules of the sub. You can post ISOFT posts of full bottles till you reach a certain level of flair. The flair rules are in the sidebar.So you cant explicitly post an ISOFT without  reviews or at least  swaps? What about if you do it through PMs?,whiskyinventory,cspdb9c,1,t5_33y9e
