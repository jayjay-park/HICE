4619421,0,t1_ctcno1u,gt meat does give us some nutrients that it has and only meat hasThat is what I am arguing. This research shows omitting meat in your diet has greater health benefits and also notes a few key nutrients that can be easily incorporated into ones diet. Meat is by far not necessary on any health grounds. It would in fact be healthier to omit it in diets. Also current foods and drinks are regularly fortified with different supplements. For example Iodine is added in water eggs are fortified with omegas yogourt has extra vitamin D. You can find more here but so much of what you eat is already fortified with extra nutrients you previously would not get and are beneficial to your overall health essential or nonessential like fluoride. Once again not eating meat will at the very minimum not cost you more and will likely save you money Not eating meat will not cause any problems that cant be easily fixed along with helping you financially and healthwise too regardless of being poor or not. Even in the past meat was only eaten by royalty andor on special occasions. It was minimal in most peoples diets e.g. a couple times a year. It is also not some key development in human history and stopping eating meat would not deprive of us of anything.It would not happen immediately i.e. not tomorrow but a gradual change e.g. within a year could easily support the entire population. Heck it may be the only way to even sustain our lives on Earthgt making something illegal that is necessary in most peoples lives.I still have yet to find an argument saying meat is necessary. It is something people strongly want but certainly not something people need from anything I have presented or read in this or any other forum.,CalmDebate,ctcusl5,1,t5_390qb
