46385,0,t1_cejoi75,I havent played Borg yet on that mod but everything that Ive read days that the Borg ships are a lot more expensive to produce so Id summer the Borgs titan would cost a lot to make,SoSE,cejpmmo,3,t5_2s8hu
118156,0,t1_cerb2te,Yeah that is true.My post was purely lorebased it was about the TECs aesthetic. In replays I sometimes watch swarms of TEC bombers attacking something and wonder hmm all those missiles must be pretty pricy... and Advent just fire lasers at everything which are relatively free... but the TEC probably dont care cuz theyre the TEC.Gameplaywise I do agree with you. The TEC just become increasingly beleaguered after the end of the LF era unless you play someone significantly less experienced or the AI which just herpderps into red buttons a lot.My preference for TECs lategame is a primarily carrier fleet with a few support cruisers and a Titan and caps. The carriers can have their armament varied depending on what the enemy is deploying massed corvettes or bombers gt fighters anything else gt bombers dontknow gt both and can keep their distance from any Titan except the Vorastra for a long time not as easily as Repulsiontastic Advent but good enough.However in a pitched battle TEC craft do still lose to Advent and Vasa craft. More so Vasari if they have Jam Weapons and fighters since theres no micro against Jam Weapons except to try to disable the Kortuls. With Advent you can sort of micro bombers against TK Push and if you can hit their craft with Flak Burst it hurts more. And the Ragnarov also does pretty well against them because it can outrange Repulsion and wipe shields with Snipes or Explosive Shots while mitigation is low.Against Vasari Im not entirely sure what works. It seems if they dont get killed early enough they are unstoppably badass although the few times Ive tried playing them the starbase strategy opening feels weird enough and Ive sucked at it enough that Id say that they deserve cool shit for surviving.,SoSE,cervwh7,1,t5_2s8hu

1589215,0,t1_cjcrlwi,Nope light carriers Percheron Lasurak Aeria need AM to build strikecraft both initial and replacement. Thats why you should not rally point them outside of the gravity well theyre built in because theyll burn AM jumping and be slower to ready to full combat capability. You should just have a rally point by the exit to their factories grav well and keep ordering them to build strikecraft every so often. Then once you have a decent mass of fully prepared cruiser carriers add them to your fleet.Hangars also consume AM to build and replace strikecraft. Theyre simpler to manage though because they dont jump.Capital ships both carrier types and others dont consume AM and just build strikecraft on a passive cooldown. Same thing with starbases and Titans. So once youve specified their squadrons theyll build them and keep rebuilding lost craft passively while doing whatever else it is you want them to be doing.,SoSE,cjfhpmt,3,t5_2s8hu
1630150,0,t1_cjk9apg,I have figured out one brutal tactic when I use the borg too.  You dont build that stupid although very powerful for early stage cap ship. Build  war labs and warp in locutus cube as your free cap and GG. You still get the free cap once you research either borg cube or tactical cube. I usually wait and go with the tactical. Then it is really GG.  If you get long enough in the game to build the borg titan which you shouldnt unless you are toying with your food then its totally GG after that. And my God that upgraded Borg starbase is just ridiculous. ,SoSE,cjkn8te,2,t5_2s8hu

2903983,0,t1_cnxommh,In a game where efficient use of funds matters when playing against skilled opponents avoid trade on starbases unless youre eco have a large income already  cs and the starbase is necessary to extend your trade chain. Sometimes youre unlucky with planet placement and have to go through a noncolonizable well while moving towards the center of the map and the only way to connect your HW area chain to the planets closer to the center is to build a connecting starbase.Hangar and armor upgrades are situational as well. Usually hangar structures will be significantly more effective as TEC due to flak but if your constructors are dead or a titan is near doing damage to structures hangars wont work so for more strikecraft immediately youre forced to use the starbase upgrade if you dont have frigate factories to build carriers.,SoSE,cny6szw,1,t5_2s8hu

7835270,0,t1_d3weezc,Honestly I think Interregnum is the most wellmade mod of the three with my favourite ship designs and voice acting!SoGE is amazing as well but just slightly dated and while Ascendancy is also no passing mod either I feel its just a little incomplete what with missing voice acting and some other minor bugsmissing content. It also has the most challenging UI though I think thats part of the charm!Interregnum just feels so satisfying to watch  Ill usually play as the Empire and once Ive built all the cap ships and the Titan Ill launch a huge offensive and then zoom in to watch from a TIE fighters perspective. ,SoSE,d3wr2xr,6,t5_2s8hu
