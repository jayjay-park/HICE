1217,0,t3_1u4efs,Perhaps installing a lighter bolt? Are you running a rd party recoil kit at all? If so you could try removing that and replacing it with the stock buffer. Also youll probably get more shots out of propane but I understand that may not be possible because you might need new mags. Speaking of mags check the seals on your magazines just in case some co is leaking. That could be the problem if they are old magazines. I have personally always used propane mags in my WE M and I found that seals need to be replaced quite often on WE mags. ,GasBlowBack,ceeks5p,1,t5_2wj1q

4686511,0,t1_ctl5vsp,This guy! I bought the co mags and the valves are a Bitch and if you go into high altitude say good bye to the stupid green washerWe m platform is highly lacking but can be sexy. My main experience is with the Ak pmc and it will not die and its st gen. Next is the kwa akg thing is awesome and light as fuck but lack of internal part cross compatibility is frustrating and mags love to leak. My newest addition is a gym akms feels solid like the we Ak. Im in the middle of doing a flat hop on it since its my primary and doesnt get the range I wantAll three big ak brand names are solid to be honest it just goes with your budget. I spent around  on all my aks to get them where I wanted ,GasBlowBack,ctla2ke,2,t5_2wj1q
4754516,0,t3_3fytze,They have entirely different trigger boxes. Thankfully both have steel trigger options.I have been burned in the past by the WE M platform. I specifically bought a newer  from evike and it was a fucking shitshow. I just cant personally recommend them at all. But I am definitely a minority and theres tons of upgrade options for that platform.But if it was me and my money Id get the msk. The fire selector can be stiff and the outer barrel can wobble a bit but the external quality shits on the  and I just like masadas better anyway. You have so much work to do with the standard . Remove the ugly fucking trademarks get a  stock  pistol grip etc. MSK is just easier and better IMO.But if youre open to other choices Id go for the new SCAR H. Gun is absolutely beautiful and now my favorite.,GasBlowBack,cttuoqh,1,t5_2wj1q

6052198,0,t3_3v2025,shimming will further seat your mag lower making your gun to not feed.Ive had the exact same problem as you a few days ago though I am using a WOC M. Take out your mag catch to see if its worn down. Mine was worn down by mm. I bought a new steel mag catch.Or Ive seen people put washers under the mags top plate to seat it a little higher so itll feed.ps. after I got the new mag catch the magazines rubber gas bucking was too high making the bolt not cycling properly but a bit of sanding down the rubber gas bucking quickly fixed it.,GasBlowBack,cycy0av,1,t5_2wj1q

6766695,0,t1_d0invrx,For the price the KWA masada is not worth it in my opinion. If you want that style gun get the WE.The G as mentioned is great! GHK makes the best magazines and mags are really important on a GBB.
