5015528,0,t1_cuqj0fw,Its all right. Youre just starting out. Plenty of game left to play. Youre new to stealth game so Ill explain some nuances Ive learned through the older metal gear games and Tom Clancy games. To be stealthy you have to be unseen and unheard. Also dont be smelly  take a shower every once in a while. Youll know what Im talking about when you get there. So to be unseen move when youre not in someones line of sight. Use the shadows. Use terrainobstacles to obscure you. Stay low. Prone crawl when you have no cover. Wear appropriate camouflage youll get that later.To be unheard dont knock over things. Watch your movement speed  its easier to be heard when youre up and sprinting as opposed to crawling. Use your silenced weapons remember theyre only good for so many shots before it wears out. Use CQC to take out soldiers quietly. And most important be patient. If it looks like its difficult to get in somewhere then either stir the pot up with some chaos or wait for the situation to change. Stick to taking out soldiers one by one. When you get used to it you can take out pairs or even groups stealthily. You got this! I believe in you Boss!,MetalGearSolidV_PC,cuqk7qf,5,t5_39hv5

5071976,0,t3_3kes1j,Id love to see Free RoamSide Ops CoOp as well. And as as uElderCub said being able to have a soldier as a buddy instead of being limited to the couple few we have and being able to customize their outfit for the free roamside opsmission you are doing.That would be awesome.EDITLets keep this in mind tho even if this wont apply for Console Players sadly The modding scene is starting the master files can be unpacked repacked and the LUA files decrypted and encrypted. File Names are being found and added to the Dictionary so that we wont be stuck with random file names and have an easier time finding the proper LUA file for what we might want to modify or add?.Who knows what might be possible in terms of unofficial modding.PS Hooking DLLs could also be possible to add content. Skyrims Script Extender more Papyrus Script Functions and C possible is an example.,MetalGearSolidV_PC,cuxd5m1,2,t5_39hv5
5079875,0,t3_3kkjy1,I actually have  controllers and tend to rotate which one I use havent had a problem with any of them Xbox  controller DualShock  and Xbone controller.All work fine DS and Xbone can use the same USB cable too. DS requires InputMapper and theres a mod out there to replace Xbox button prompts with Playstation ones. But the game works outright with the Xbox controllers.Id say out of them all probably the  is the best. The Xbones texturized thumbsticks irritate me after a while of using it but the triggers are great on it the bumpers are a little weird you get used to them but they never really feel all that great You roll your trigger fingers onto the far corners of them dont really clickpush them like a traditional button. Theyre a bit bothersome if you ever have to hold them down or hold them down frequently.Xboxs thumbsticks feel alright though they kind of wear down your thumbs after a while of using them the controller itself is fine DSs thumbsticks are the most comfortable and feel fine but the pause menuidroid menu buttons are small and spread far apart due to the touchpad the RL front shoulder buttons also dont really feel quite as snappy to use as the s shoulder bumpers plus the closeness of the RL buttons to them makes you sometimes cock up and use the wrong button though thats mostly me.Also the  controller is probably the most affordable I had a white version for about  or so years that I finally replaced because the thumbstick rubber coating was chipping off. Got a newer black one for about  bucks. The xbone cost about  the DS I think was  on a newegg sale.Yeah Xbox  controller  at AmazonXbone  at AmazonDS  at Amazon Other colors are more expensive,MetalGearSolidV_PC,cuybfj1,2,t5_39hv5
