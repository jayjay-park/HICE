10116241,0,t1_dbpr6uf,gtgt Is Rchain supposed to be censorship resistant like Casper? Doesnt this imply that the protocol must recognize one or more currencies and set the prices as legitimate fee payments to enforce inclusion of these uncensored state changes?gt Nope you can ensure that state changes arent censored without allowing payment for those state changes in any currency. Actually allowing bonding in multiple tokens makes censorship easier to pull off.Im talking about Rchain not generally. In your article you seemed to say these sorts of things would be up to the clients. If the validators dont agree on the amount of the minimum staking bond this would result in a fork. If they dont agree on the minimum fee for a state change to be protected from censorship one set of validators would fine the censor while the others wouldnt which would lead to a fork. Therefore I think Rchain devs must be picking which currencies to include and they must pick exchange rates or price discovery method or it wouldnt really be the complete consensus algo.Greg intends to include Bitcoin and Ether what he says about the role of the AMP omni asset and the Rchain omni asset is more confusing as is the whole concept of multicoin as you call it economic abstraction but I will get to that with some other questions.,RChain,dbq5k2l,1,t5_3hrsl
