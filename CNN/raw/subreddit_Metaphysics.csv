2323596,0,t3_2lnk2y,To your last question I would say that the proponents of panpsychism would argue that consciousness is inherent to everything in the universe with the cautions and caveat to not anthropomorphize such a thing. A protoconsciousness if you will. At its most mechancial form you could say that any time there is an action and reaction that is a representation of a protoconsciousness.So then the human consciousness emerges from the essential building blocks of the universal capacity for consciousness that pervades the universe. These brains are amazing calculators of conscious interactions.Check out David Chalmers Ted Talk on this,Metaphysics,clywrzb,2,t5_2qmtv

Turns out that infinite sum equals  so the probability that event will ever occur is .Now if you assume the event has equal independent strictly positive probability over a discrete space yes it will occur by the law of large numbers but those are pretty stringent axioms.,Metaphysics,d9jycqa,1,t5_2qmtv

If you want to believe that then thats fine but even you dont claim your belief is based on anything outside of your own head so its useless.Theres no way to demonstrate objectivism relativism or subjectivism no way to demonstrate anything. That does not make it unreasonable to believe some things are true and other things are false. Since we all use logic to think and communicate its a fair bet that logic is objective. We have no way of thinking or communicating about a world that is anything but objective.You can claim you believe in subjective truth or relativism but you dont live that way. By talking in language you are using objective rules of logic and inference. If someone owed you money but said they didnt you would dispute that object to it. Subjectivism and relativism are just for navelgazing obscurantist philosophers who live in their own thoughts and not in the real world. The thing is though they do live in the real world so they get into debates like this. Edit grammar,Metaphysics,dfpwmep,1,t5_2qmtv
