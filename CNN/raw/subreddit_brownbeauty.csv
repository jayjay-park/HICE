I bought all of mine at Sephora but Im starting to see them at the CCO for about  around here.Ive had Peach since the collection was released. I love it. I have worn it  times per week since purchase and the daisy is still quite visible. It is a great warm peachy coral color with some glimmer. It is easy to build up. It makes me look put together and made up without much effort on my part. Score!Berry is a great pop of color that blends really nicely. It builds up brightly but its not too vivid. I dont notice much shimmer with this one.Nude... I cant decide. Sometimes I think it is the perfect warmth and glow shade for me. Other times I feel like there is nothing on my face. Yet other times it seems like a pile of glitter on my cheeks. It is the only one of the new collection that I own and it is definitely more powdery than the other two.,brownbeauty,cs4ynl5,2,t5_2wm8d

9372257,0,t3_580lkm,Its not one of the brands you suggested but maybe check out Huda Beautys liquid lip in cheerleader. Its described as a muted red or something like that and its absolutely beautiful. Plus I cannot say enough good things about the formula. It honestly feels unlike any other liquid lip Ive tried. Seriously check it out. On the cheaper end NYX has some beautiful reds as well! I like the matte lipstick in perfect red and the liquid suede in cherry skies. I also had a bullet lipstick in the shade Alabama that was really nice but I cant seem to find the tube to double check the name on that one. Im a little darker than you at NC  but I can provide swatches if youd like. Edited to add Project Chimp from KVD is also a beautiful red that I think looks really nice on oliveyellow complexions.

Its not terrible and great for summer but not  really what I would consider a fall look. If youre into following the whole seasonal makeup thing . I remember another NC Girl messaged me saying she really did not like Gemini on her. So it probably depends a lot a your natural lip pigment and just what you prefer. I dont have celebrity skin but based on how it looks compared to Gemini I would skip.  I think it would wash us out. Masochist looks like a fun color that I think we could rock.

Its CRAZY expensive for the amount you get but I swear its like magic in a bottle. Super lightweight not drying under the eyes and even though its orange and a corrector it almost works like a concealer. Like once I blend that in under my eyes I dont even see the orange and I only put an actual concealer over it when I want to highlight.
