933683,0,t3_24rz29,I believe it was because there was another request above yours. We saw that one first so we accepted it and then the clan was full and we couldnt let anyone else in.Weve also been rejecting people lately for having overly rushed bases which is a reason many Reddit clans reject people. I dont know what your base looks like but if its rushed that could contribute.,RedditSierra,chaexn5,2,t5_2y8zn
933884,0,t1_chaf94s,Youre right ill see if i can get a disclaimer clause added.All welcome!LCOE reserves the right to reject anyone for any reason.As for sounding like a snobdick in my previous post i honestly wasnt aiming to sound like that. I apologize if youre insulted from that post attempting to explain why every clan is rejecting you. I gave you a straight answer no sugar coating no babying. I gave you the straight hard facts ive seen from your profile. You havent been in any clan since your shield is up coupled with your post that you have  days shield remaining. Inferring from that youve been clanless for one day. Doesnt make it up to have only  troops donated from start til now. Also doesnt explains your  dark elixir loot. Sierra is still a social clan at its roots. People are actively in game on chat filling up donations and raiding. Even if we accepted you our bimonthly minimum is almost half your total donations todate. Do you think you can achieve that? If so ill accept your request next time you apply.,RedditSierra,chafrb2,2,t5_2y8zn
