201694,0,t3_1wefpt,At the beginning of the period. I kinda split people into sections of people working on Cesar people almost done people completely lost etc.. So that way they could somewhat collaborate while waiting on me. Seemed to work fairly well. ,cop3502,cf1ez6c,2,t5_2zohz

443322,0,t3_1z5eqc,Say we do int A  The value of the actual variable A is   the memory space in RAM associated with A is a sequence of bytes that correspond to the number .But if we do int B  The value of B is a location in memory  an address  where the array starts. So B points to a sequence of bytes that correspond to  then  then . But B itself is actually the address of . B means Yo whats at the address B points to?B means Hey dawg whats at the address B  ?So to simplify When you pass an array to a function you are not copying the array and putting it in the scope of the function  instead you are telling the function where to look for the array in memory.,cop3502,cfqprca,5,t5_2zohz

598811,0,t3_20z0h8,If I were to venture a guess Id say that somehow each Upgrade object in your ArrayList becomes an object reference to the same object i.e. multiple pointers to the same object.If my assumptions are correct and Im making a lot of assumptions here without looking at your code whatever youre using to construct the Upgrade objects doesnt actually create a new object it just resets the parameters of the old object and builds a new reference to the same object. In other words youre currently making a shallow copy but you want a deep copy,cop3502,cg8c6v7,2,t5_2zohz
601174,0,t1_cg8hywt,You cant put a function like changeColor directly into the Timer constructor. The second argument in Timer must be a subclass of ActionListener as I showed above. Look at how we set up the timer we already have for the GameMotion    timer  new Timer new GameMotion,cop3502,cg8luxh,1,t5_2zohz

819668,0,t3_23hpg4,The GameState class is not required but it gives you a way to reason about how your game should progress.  Think of the game like a series of steps Take in input text from the user Process that input to see what steps the game should take change location interact with an item etc. Change the game state based on what steps were taken Print the result to the screen text of the new room text of the successfully interacting with the item etc.The GameState as a class might hold all of variables associated with whats going on in your game RIGHT NOW.  Which location am I in?  The GameState will tell you.  Which items do I have?  The GameState will tell you.Its not like the Parameters class for Flappy Bird.  This only held constant parameters we used to design the game.  Ideally GameState holds variables that could change and will change every time something in the game changes.Imagine you were to save the game in the middle.  What are the things youd have to save to reproduce everything exactly the way it is?  These are things that would be useful to put into a GameState.Remember that you do not need a GameState if it doesnt make sense in your implementation.  I merely provided my own way of approaching the game.,cop3502,cgxg5t0,3,t5_2zohz
