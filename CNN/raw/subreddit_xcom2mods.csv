6541145,0,t1_czvjfvg,gt The way I see it the bulk of the tuning will be most effective at the stage of testing. I didnt make it clear but yes that is what I meant Pgt increasing his base health would be completely OP also considering that he could be healed Possibly but you could also just reduce the amount of health the enforcer gets when they levels upgt Might as well abandon one idea for the benefit of the other if it will be necessary to maintain the balance.I dont think either idea should be abandoned as both are viable and could be well balancedgt Damage interception... I think that it would actually be best to make it an ability with a cooldown e.g.  or  turns I completely agree with you there. Thats the best way to go about it.gt Maybe we can counter that by simply blocking overwatch if the Enforcer used Intercept before. Or we could make this ability end Enforcers turn the same way overwatch does.The later option is the best one in my opinion but its down to you as it is your idea.

I can contest to this because if I point my cursor closest to a XCOM unit and type in the debug console command KillUnitClosestToCursor my XCOM soldier becomes unusable. In addition when finishing the mission it counts  unit dead in the tally  which again all my XCOM soldiers are alive except for AdvMECH.

7005640,0,t3_4bmf6b,If you look at how ReseachCompletedFn is called it passes in a NewGameState which is intended to be tinkered with. After the function call it makes sure to trigger ResearchCompleted event and then submits the NewGameState. So you should do all of your tinkering inside of the NewGameState. Or through an event listener waiting for ResearchCompleted to trigger. You definitely shouldnt be submitting multiple game states before ResearchCompletedFn has finished.EmptySlot and FillSlot actually do very little under the hood so I would poke around more to see what is actually making the changes happen and try to duplicate just the minimal set of changes needed.As far as changing it back since Tygan is a unit I would take advantage of the UnitValue map. You can call GetUnitValueTyganDressed LocalUnitValue to see if he is dressed or not. When you dress him you would call SetUnitFloatValueTyganDressed  and when setting him back you would use SetUnitFloatValueTyganDressed .Make sense?,xcom2mods,d1afmok,3,t5_3b96c

7061594,0,t1_d1gsbf6,Yes the key problem being Find a point at which the units have been created but before theyve been turned into pawns.  The skyranger screen is too late because the spawn manager has already used the data from XComMissions.ini to create all the instances.  The spawn manager is native core so I cant interfere there.Ill poke around at this some more.  One alternative is to use a loop to generate many templates each with a different hairstyle and let the spawn manager pick among all these.

7356410,0,t1_d2agz6n,gt A better way to add things to the research Proving Grounds and GTS lists. The current options are screenlisteners and overriding templates which both have problems especially template overrides since theyll probably have conflicts with any DLC that mods the existing templates never mind other mods.My mod Elerium Grounds does this for the Proving Grounds without overriding anything i would imagine it would be somewhat similar for Research and GTS using their own template types.In order to add them to the game you can look at the Elerium Grounds script files all the source code is packaged with the mods after all i create a new class that extends the XStrategyElement in this class at the top theres a function called CreateTemplates.    static function arrayltXDataTemplategt CreateTemplates        local arrayltXDataTemplategt Techs        Techs.AddItemCreateEleriumCore    Techs.AddItemUpgradeSpiderSuit    Techs.AddItemUpgradeExoSuit        return Techs    The function creates all the new templates just below them for the new proving grounds projects and return them as an array this is automatically called by the game when it is started and are after that automatically added as potential techs when starting a new campaign in order to add them to a game in progress though you need to manually add the techs to the potential tech list the following code is called in the autogenerated method OnLoadedSavedGame for each of the techs.    static function bool AddTechXComGameState NewGameState Name TechName         local XStrategyElementTemplateManager StratMgr    local XTechTemplate TechTemplate    local XComGameStateTech TechState        if GameHasTechTechName        WriteLogERROR ADDING TechName  TECH ALREADY ADDED?!    return false            StratMgr  classXStrategyElementTemplateManager.static.GetStrategyElementTemplateManager    TechTemplate  XTechTemplateStratMgr.FindStrategyElementTemplateTechName        if TechTemplate  none        WriteLogERROR ADDING TechName UNABLE TO LOCATE TEMPLATE    return false            TechState  XComGameStateTechNewGameState.CreateStateObjectclassXComGameStateTech    TechState.OnCreationTechTemplate    NewGameState.AddStateObjectTechState    return true    This adds a tech to a game in progress so it can be developed.I would think the same procedure would be possible for each of the development branches of the game the GTS Research Engineering and Proving Grounds projects all of them are differing types of State objects after all my code is simply specialized for Tech types of State objects.,xcom2mods,d2edgep,1,t5_3b96c

7786830,0,t3_4lyx3c,So youre using Attrition Mode and looking at its source code?  Its ideal to learn from the code of mods you like so long as you never directly copy their code without permission or credit.  Long War Studios mods are built for this. Probably the best way to learn code and a coding mindset is to look at what others have done and figure out how they did it.That said I dont know where to edit the reload ability but you can get good reference for ammo use in XAbility .uc files.  This is from XAbilityAdventMEC    AmmoCost  new classXAbilityCostAmmo      AmmoCost.iAmmo        Template.AbilityCosts.AddItemAmmoCost  At the top of that function below the line declaring it is this line    local XAbilityCostAmmo AmmoCostThis tells the function for MicroMissiles that there will be an ammo cost or rather charges of that perk or item.Modifying the reload ability for all units could lead to AI confusion for the rare outofammo Advent squad but I doubt thats much issue.
