Motorola had around  years of future products in the pipeline when Google acquired it IIRC.  Assuming that pattern remains the same and Lenovo doesnt come in and wipe the slate clean there will probably be another generation or two of Googleinfluenced designs coming to market.I dont think it makes as much sense to farm out the super budget phone rights as it does with the Nexus line.

You know on your old phone when you mounted mass storage you couldnt do anything on the phone that accessed SD card? Yeah this was supposed to solve that It is known to be not very reliable at times. Best I can suggest is just use some wifi file transfer program.

2337618,0,t3_2m2yqx,I can offer some general information  may be helpful.As most probably know the Motorola Feedback Network an option for Motorola Owners Forum members often conducts software testing. We have more than one flavor of test and its never safe to conclude that the software being tested is final. If it were certainly final we would not test it.There is an aspect of testing that involves owners who are not part of the Motorola Feedback Network. Our final Soak tests include members of the general population partly to expand the possible configurations the software has to work on and partly to expand the raw numbers of testers. Sometimes the software is pushed at random to make up the group and sometimes we make it available for pull to those paying attention. So to address your final two questions What is the Kernel System amp Build versions for the soak test? We need people who are involved in the soak test and believe they have the soak test update to reply and confirm. We do ask for confidentiality from our testers. But beyond that its not safe to assume that a Soak build is final.  Can any of our users confirm receiving the OTA update without subscribing to Motos testing program? This is certainly possible as described above.My advice  sign up for the Motorola Feedback Network and avoid the confusion and only accept our OTA updates if you want to be sure to get final software.,MotoG,cm0n4lj,7,t5_2z2hw

2974126,0,t1_co65vqj,Theres a memory leak in Android Lollipop. Memory leaks are bugs in programming where a program will indifinitely continue using up more memory until the program is turned off and the memory is released. What this results in is you losing all your available memory over time where at first multitasking results in constant program shutdowns. Eventually you lose all your memory and you cant run anything anymore until you do a full reboot. From reading teh bug reports the memory leak is somewhere in the graphics stack framework some animation code more specifically.Luckily its been fixed and while it hasnt been merged by the Android team into ..  as its scheduled for the next release some OEMs  have taken the patch and merged it into their releases of .. early.

3452786,0,t3_2zs4d2,Welcome to the club! I think youll find a smartphone is a great addition to your personal life and you picked an excellent phone for its cost.. These items are at your discretion. It isnt a bad idea to protect your investment with a screen cover or case but some people dont like the way they make the screen or phone lookfeel. A MicroSD card will give you extra storage room which I would suggest. You can purchase them pretty cheaply now.. I wouldnt say it can compete with  flagships but it can hold its own. The hardware in the Moto G is solid with a good core CPU and  GB of RAM. Really the memory is the only weak point if you would and Lollipop and once the memory issues are ironed out.. should run just fine.. The camera on the Moto G is poor. At the cost of the device some things end up with cut corners.. and Moto cut corners on the camera. Its almost worthless. Dont plan to take any nice photos with it.. Some phones do some do not. Depends on the manufacturer tier highend midrange lowend etc. Moto didnt include much to pass on the savings. . Rooting it will give you even more flexibility and control over your phone and my understanding is that CyanogenMod runs very nicely on the G LTE for example.. Essential and recommended? Well I think Google Maps and Navigation is essential. Id also recommend you try out Google Launcher. Really once you have your phone search for a Google application in the Play store Maps GMail etc. and when you find one scroll down to More apps by this developer which is a great way to find content by sources you like.. Change? Not sure. I would suggest at least playing with the phone a bit and maybe using it for a few days before rooting it so you can at least compare your performance and experience between stock and root.. Lollipop for all its awesome new features has some bugs. The biggest issues are related to memory leaks and the problems that occur because of it. Apparently . fixes a lot of problems associated with . AND makes a dramatic difference in terms of smoothness and usability. Google has indicated that they resolved further bugs as of ... I think Moto will provide both to Moto G in time but if you root you might be able to take advantage of the fixes earlier than Moto provides an update.The Moto G LTE is not a flagship device. However for the money its one of the best bangforyourbuck smartphones you can buy. Its an excellent decision and once Lollipops issues are ironed out I think youre going to be very happy with it.,MotoG,cpluerq,9,t5_2z2hw

If Ive unlocked the bootloader and tried to modify the recovery but it appears to still be stock recovery does that mean I can receive OTA updates as usual?

4697948,0,t3_3f99l6,When the Moto G first came out it hit the sweet spot for value phones.  There was little competition in that space.  It was clearly the most phone for the money.  And the fact that Google acquired Motorola gave it a big boost too.Things have changed since then.  Motorola is no longer a Google company.  There is now lots of competition in the value phone space which is good for consumers.I think the part of the market that Motorola used to have sewn up is now shared with the zenfone  idol  oneplus and a number of Chinese brands.A lot of people also got pissed off at Motorola over how long it took to get updated to Lollipop.  In my opinion its googles fault and they are still fixing bugs in Lollipop but people tend to blame the company that made their phone.Motorola also made an unfortunate choice in minfree settings in kitkat to prefer giving the active app lots of memory versus multitasking.  This caused much frustration for owners of unrooted phones or those who werent comfortable changing minfree.Perhaps the best insurance policy for development is if a phone is officially supported by cyanogenmod?,MotoG,ctmprsw,2,t5_2z2hw

7375002,0,t3_4g8jg9,Here is something to try before you start uninstalling apps or performing resets  have you made any changes to battery optimisation? Go to Settings  Battery. At the top right hit the  dot menu and choose Battery optimisation.The next screen will probably just have Google Play Services and one or two other Google apps. These are the apps that are NOT being optimised. As far as I can see optimisation puts apps to sleep or reduces performance. Hit the drop down menu at the top of the screen and select All apps. The next screen will have a list of all apps. Tap the main apps that you use and select Dont Optimise. So Whatsapp Messenger SMS app phone app Snapchat Instagram Twitter and anything else that you use every day. You can ignore apps that you dont use regularly or need notifications from. This might help. My wife has a rd Gen and her phone slowed to a crawl and took  seconds to react.

10225999,0,t1_dc35exd,It seems similar to my G.. Youll notice the whiter pixels lag slightly more. This is just normal for the lcd panel theyre using. Again Im using high end monitors on my PC that exhibit ghosting too. Its common. You can watch this video to see the ghosting on my  monitors. Look at the clouds and notice the hole they leave as he pans the view in the plane. This is just because the monitor has a slower white to black or GG timing. However the monitor is designed for film production and photography work. Ghosting exists on all LCD monitors to some degree. Theres even a thread about this monitor here Every display will do this to some extent.Here is a Nexus with an AMOLED screen with ghosting as well. Its the nature of the display technology. He incorrectly calls it a bug. Its just a design limitation we live with since our eyes are generally used to blur when things are in motion. If you obsess over it youll notice it.

I loved my first gen and my wifes and my current second gen though its starting to get a bit wonky and I desperately need more space.Ive looked at OnePlus ZTE Huawei and other phones in the  range. Ive looked at bigger more well known players like Samsung and LG but everyone has problems so its all pretty much a crap shoot anyway. Theres no way Im shelling out the cost for a Pixel nor do I want to jump to Apple. Im looking to the G before I make a call as to where I want to head next. Im not in a huge rush but my phone is getting more frustrating by the day.,MotoG,ddhzbg8,2,t5_2z2hw

Id take the C cooler chip over a small performance boost that isnt noticeable outside of benchmarks.

11214157,0,t3_6026pg,You talking about jumping from the G Plus to the regular G? No there would be no real benefit other than the SD runs cooler than the SD. But the G Plus still has a far better camera.,MotoG,df340t3,2,t5_2z2hw

11311327,0,t1_dfe42ls,that seems pretty warm! but like you said I guess its a small compromise for such a good phone. I might wait until theres a camera comparison between the G Plus and the G not plus before I make any desicion though,MotoG,dfe4ds5,2,t5_2z2hw

11397275,0,t1_dfnrkv6,Yeah my current phone is about  years old now I think and Ive always wanted a phone with a decent camera. There have been so many times in the past where I wished I could have taken a picture or video of something but my phone camera sucks.Id get the S if it were the same price as the G Plus but I cant justify spending so much money on a phone.Thanks for the comparisons! Do you have any overheating or ghost touch problems with your G plus ?,MotoG,dfnv6sw,1,t5_2z2hw
11400732,0,t1_dfo52nw,Thanks for the feedback on your new Moto G Plus! I am particularly interested in your feedback as I have a standard Moto G and am really wanting to upgrade to a G Plus but I want to make sure that its going to be a significant upgrade compared to my Moto G. And some comments have suggested that the G Plus isnt much of an upgrade over the G Plus which made me a little skeptical about how impressive the G Plus might actually be. I realize that the G Plus is a better device than the regular G but I am hoping that the G Plus will be noticeably better than both of the G variants.Im curious have you gotten around to using the camera on the G Plus yet? If so how does it compare the the camera on the G Plus? Is it noticeably better on any way? Does it focus as quickly? Is it as good asbetter in lowlight situations? Overall what are your thoughts on it?And how does the G Plus feel in your hands? Is it actually smaller in overall size than the G Plus? Do you like the way it feels while holding it? And is it small enough to comfortably use with one hand?Sorry to ask so many questions. If you wouldnt mind replying again when you get a chance and sharing some more feedback on the phone after youve gotten to use it for a while please know that it would be appreciated!,MotoG,dfo9bmk,2,t5_2z2hw
11407038,0,t3_62npr9,Im no stranger to Android my daily driver is a rooted Nexus P running a custom ROM and kernel. But this is taking a very long time. I started the update close to  minutes ago and its still on the white Moto boot screen. ,MotoG,dfoz2lf,1,t5_2z2hw

11465031,0,t1_dfskmgo,Yes the RAM is very important. I started with the  version. Was listening to SiriusXM opened the camera took a picture. SiriusXM just closed out totally on its own kicked out of RAM. Very annoying.Exchanged for a  and have zero issues. The idle RAM usage on the  was like  on idle nothing open. The  idles at like .

11552838,0,t1_dg5hnd7,Having tried it on several quick charge adapters with several different ROMs I can confirm that it does not in fact support Quick Charge. The faster charging times people were experiencing was probably due to the fact that the stock charger is only A or so while the phone can pull around .A over USB. Since most quick charge adapters can provide A or more in regular charging that is why people were experiencing faster charge times. The same speedup can be achieved with a regular non quick .A charger.The Motorola site says something along the lines of faster charging with W rapid charger sold separately however that statement refers to a regular charger since W with V comes out to A which seems to make sense since the phone draws .A while charging on such a charger.,MotoG,dg5ine4,2,t5_2z2hw

11777050,0,t1_dgtr6i2,Yes I can confirm it. I had a similar problem earlier and since the phone wont work with screen locked and wont let computers access data all you can do is a factory reset. Next time make sure to hold no information on the phone without an external copy and to backup your photos via Google Photos or anything else. Sorry man its no use crying over spilt milk.,MotoG,dguys9d,2,t5_2z2hw
