11326739,0,t1_dffshza,Hey thanks for your reply. These courses are pretty different but Im trying to be open to different areas of math. If I had to pick Id say I have a soft spot for algebra making rings and modules an easy pick. Analysis on Manifolds seems very interesting. I noticed it has an oral exam rather than written. I have never done an oral exam so Im not sure if I should take it. Are they much different from written exams? I am thinking of staying away from the Lebesgue integration course simply because the analysis sequence is quite different at ntnu than at my school UWaterloo in Canada. ,ntnu,dffv82y,1,t5_2rt5i
