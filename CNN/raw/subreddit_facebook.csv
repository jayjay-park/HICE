775548,0,t1_cgsfbac,I think your missing my point... I completely understand that Facebook can absolutely do what ever it wants. The question is... is what they are doing right? Again they can block what ever they want but doesnt make it right. They can make public what ever information on your profile they want... does that make it right?The point is a company is suppressing political speech... What kind of back lash would Facebook twitter or Reddit received if they blocked videos text or tweets from Egypt Libya Syria or Tunisia?This isnt about law... Im not here to take a case to the court of law. Do you think its right that they are doing this? and if your answer is yes then why dont they do that in any of the countries named above?,facebook,cgsfmz8,2,t5_2qh8o

4819309,0,t3_3ghhmf,the world has become incredibly self obsessed in the past  years. everyone seems to think they are unique and different from everyone else. they also all seem to think deep down that the world revolves around them like god created this world solely for them. its getting incredibly frustrating but i have hope. i think after this phase of incredible self obsession and self centeredness and self absorption and narcsissism that we will move into a better era. i think this will lead to the eventual and obvious realization that there actually is no such thing as the self or identity. and that consciousness is not a product of the brain but rather precedes shapes and forms physical matter and reality. i think we just have to get over this hurdle before we move onto better more connected more unified times. but the first step is getting over ourselves. but they dont actually exist and were all just delusional narcissists who think were all somebody special when in fact were all just nobody.,facebook,cu20hvp,3,t5_2qh8o

Two weeks ago however my aunt who is restricted from seeing my relationship status saw my status and asked me about it.Whats up with this?

10893611,0,t3_5jhjp7,Hi guys.I am locked out of my Facebook account. And the reason is because I need to verify my identity. Im not talking about me identifying five of my friends photos that kind of identity verification. Im talking about someone reporting me for fraud. This account has  friends and  followers.The name on the account is breaker Rush. I am something of an Internet celebrity where I live. I was locked out because Im not using my real life name on that account. So I submitted my identification to Facebook as they asked. What do you guys think will happen now? Has this happened to anyone else here before?,facebook,de3lkec,2,t5_2qh8o
