6300025,0,t3_41wf1g,Are there plans for a reputation mechanic?And in the cases where players may be robbing other players with pvp will there be a mechanic identifies them as criminals or at least a reputation of being a bandit?,Herossong,cz5qphv,1,t5_3bz74
6317369,0,t1_cz6t4xm,Choices in each of the human races? Does that mean there are sub groups or you just mean there are different characters that look that way?,Herossong,cz7pq3v,1,t5_3bz74
6780674,0,t3_46n2qm,I like abilities that have additional costs in addition to mana.Some games have health costs which is cool. Other games add tension or super meters which can make regular moves different or more powerful as well as execute the most powerful moves. Other games have some unique resources for individual characters that can be very fun.In terms of effects I like a mix of melee and ranged abilities with various ranges for both. I like movement abilities that allow me to approach escape and interact with the other abilities. I like abilities with knock back that allow me to control the flow of battle and break up enemy formations. Stuns snares walls stasis and other effects are fun too.I like projectiles or AOE abilities that buff  debuff  alter other abilities. Shooting a projectile through an AOE field to add fire damage would be really cool. Jumping to or away from an AOE field would be cool. An AOE which draws in enemies or projectiles like a gravity well would be cool.Mine abilities delayed AOE explosions may explode on contact may blow up when they run out of HP tend to be a little difficult to use but might be more fun when combined with other abilities like knocking an enemy into the explosion.I like escalation abilities power builds up over time with multiple hits or ability uses deescalation abilities start out powerful lose power over time or as you take hits mode switching offense vs defense mode Bloodborne weapons switch between weapon pairs with different effects turn into monster with different abilities rotating effects changes effects with each cast or over time and tells you which one will currently apply Absorb bonus effects temporarily steal enemy power speed damage effects and so on.In general I would focus on abilities that speed up the game. Having a sniper one hit kill ability with a long cool down or other resource requirement would make the game a drag. It would be better to make that game hit more often and balance that ability in other ways. Even if you have other abilities to have fun with this is probably your only sniper ranged one.I prefer other ways to balance abilities than cool downs in general more like fighting games. Autoattack tends to be boring. Its better to be able to work with and choose between a set of spammable abilities with interaction with your other abilities and moving in and out of range.,Herossong,d0kvgv4,2,t5_3bz74
8467799,0,t3_4uclny,Tried to start a new thread but heres as good as anywere I guess.For anybody who hasnt been following Smedleys Twitter account personally I hate twitter theres been quite a few interesting tweets over the last few days about how the games shaping up.  Im particularly interested in the emergent battle between AI orcs and dwarves.  Going through  guys to test something because of permadeath seems fun too.  individually designed items already in with plans for  maybe !  And  classes!Hey Smed when can we get a playthrough video to geek out on?  And is there gonna be any kind of early access beta test in the plans?  If so when?,Herossong,d600hye,2,t5_3bz74
8877765,0,t3_51ui6f,Just want to say its awesome to get an update and see that this game is shaping up to be something special. Keep it up everyone at Pixelmage!,Herossong,d7ezdj0,3,t5_3bz74
8878234,0,t1_d7f0e96,As a consumer and a gamer. Id rather play a game that is professionally developed. I dont think an entry level HS student makes professionally developed products. I wasnt trying to denigrate anyone. Or prevent them from starting up in the gaming industry. I just have standards as a consumer that I expect while buying a product from a game developer. Minecraft is also a game played by a younger demographic. Hence why I called it a kids game. Just like I can say Age of Wushu was an MMO that appealed more to an Asian demographic. Not gonna dig for deets or quotes. Lol. Using common sense. I think the developer should have power to create content patch the game and provide tools to the community that are used to modify said game. I dont believe or enjoy when modders run the scene and the devs kick back their heels and let the community do all of the work. The community for a video game are the players playing the game. There are small microcosms communities within this. There might be an RP PVP community an RP community. Players apart of these play by their own means and govern themselves. Community can be used in a broad sense. Or a small sense when referencing the smaller microcosms or specifically hosted servers. I dunno even why we are debating this its been posted that modding is coming later. Lets just wait on the game to release and see if it even needs heavy modding. I understand you like the freedom of modding stuff. Id just rather see the game and play it before worrying about modding it to death. ,Herossong,d7f1en7,1,t5_3bz74
8885395,0,t1_d7fr7zf,In the stream on Cohh he said he was over the whole microtransaction thing and hated it and it would not be in this game.,Herossong,d7fwdj6,1,t5_3bz74

8935033,0,t1_d7ljuqc,Thanks for doing the work on this. Loving these posts. Hoping well have some more concrete class information soon. Im particularly interested to hear if certain Gods being includedexcluded will limit class choices on a server. Hoping for a Yes on that especially if the server can progress enough where classes can be unlocked through lore.,Herossong,d7luxgi,2,t5_3bz74

9014417,0,t3_53o90j,I think the one thing that will get people excited about this game is the world building. The fact that the whole history is simulated down to the small details and all characters and objects actually exist in the world  they arent just spawned when you meet them  are the coolest aspects. Smed has said they have a very pretty history browser coming. If we can get some cool examples of that up on rgaming I think people would really like it.,Herossong,d7ve5b7,3,t5_3bz74

9347913,0,t3_58coys,From their sales model what Smed has said and the cost of the game in general I highly doubt that the expansions will be required to enjoy the game.I believe HS will continue to receive updates until it has plenty of content in its own right. Any expansions to come will likely be big game changers instead of small pieces of what should have already been a part of the game anyway like so many other companies these days.,Herossong,d90wyjn,1,t5_3bz74

9664736,0,t3_5dgsbm,ujsmed  the hero we need.Thanks for the update John!P.S. I see no mention of Bards here.P.S.S. I am mostly joking. I want my class to be awesome when it comes out. Awesome takes time.,Herossong,da4dq7q,4,t5_3bz74
9854211,0,t3_5gd1ev,Bottom line start a dwarf. Pick the race that gives your class the highest str and vitality as both scale into HP at the moment and at the moment health is king. You dont need int or wisdom or anything like that as a caster when you can easily find a weapon that one hits everything under level  what you need is to be able to take a couple of hits. I hope all this will change as they smooth out how much DMG mobs do. at the moment they need more health per level and a bit less DMG.,Herossong,das0yjy,3,t5_3bz74
