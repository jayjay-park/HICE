6323273,0,t1_cz7o70s,If you are talking about a single week that is pure coincidence the three different episodes were probably not even written and filmed at the same time. Im sure you can pick your favorite season of Arrow or last season of the Flash and find one fairly mediocre episode in there. And personally I thought this weeks Arrow was pretty cool.If you are talking about the whole shows I disagree completely. I havent seen a single person who doesnt think Arrow is worlds better this season than last and as for Flash Family of Rogues Flash of Two Worlds and Enter Zoom were all acclaimed episodes that for me stand with any from season .Yes Arrow did take a drop last season struggling to transition and grow from a gritty origin to a part of a magical comic universe and I can agree that part of that was due to the Flash speeding right along I know I know through time travel and psychic gorillas. But those growing pains were inevitable if the show ever wanted to catch up with the comic books and most critics and fans alike agree that Arrow rebounded nicely.Pretty much every show has a few bad episodes a season especially in a  episode season. I think youd be hard pressed to find others who think that Arrow is worse than last year or that Flash has taken a HUGE dive.,LegendsOfTomorrow,cz8dy0d,2,t5_37x73

However my hopes of leaving a lasting legacy were never fulfilled and in my absence the city I wished to flourish crumbled further. In no future did I feel my efforts changed anything. Now with the opportunity to fight through out time an immortal named Vandal Savage I go out with these collection of nobodies to become Legends of Tomorrow. My name is Sara Lance and I am irredeemable. An accident out on sea left me to fend for myself. To survive I had to learn things to do things unspeakable. I saw a chance to do good but ended up receiving three arrows to the chest. My sister took a chance to bring me back to life but with it a need to take.

6490125,0,t1_cznros1,Yeah that was what I was getting at although the part you quoted me wasnt about that. I believe both of them from the same era need to die for both to reincarnate  just in case Carter dies at age  and Kendra dies at age  this would allow for synced up reincarnation and ages rather than an  year old Carter meeting a newborn Kendra. Thata kind of why I said Carter wouldnt be reincarnated in  since theres already a duo living on the planet  there must be two and only two same age at the same time.

6515640,0,t1_czszo6b,Im not being trying to be condescending. Its just true. As you get older you go through stuff that forces you to mature. Its the nature of adult life vs childhood.Look Im  finished uni less than a year ago. The person I am now is very different from the person I was then because Ive been forced to adapt to adult life. All the extra responsibility getting to the point of not being a child anymore changes the way you look at things. Obviously Im not saying that all thirteen year olds are immature and all adults are mature. That would just be dumb. But in general the average thirteen year old is less mature purely because theyre still a child. Theyre still in the process of figuring it all out. Everyone is really.But when youve had to live on your own and pay bills and pay rent had relationships had break ups. Those experiences teach you about life and teach you about yourself and to me thats what maturity is. ,LegendsOfTomorrow,czt9nt0,1,t5_37x73

6566213,0,t3_45koj8,The show appears to have a lostesque version of time travel. If Im correct in that then everything that happens up to the point rip travels back to get the legends is set in stone. It already happened but we and the characters are experiencing it for the first time. So if the time masters go do what youre suggesting then one of three things has to happen  the timeline corrects itself and someone else takes place of the characters and all events unfold as expected  a parallel universe is spawned where basically everything weve seen in flash arrow and legends doesnt happen or  time paradox happens and the universemultiverse is consumed. Any way about it there doesnt seem to be anything that can be done since its already happened. Potential future spoilertheorys if this is the case eventually this show will need to go to original time that rip left and destroy savage then as theyll simply be unable to do it in the past because they already didnt do it they just dont know that yet.,LegendsOfTomorrow,czyi1fw,3,t5_37x73

6682021,0,t3_46ibgu,Well thankfully Snart and Mick got more screentime. Theyre easily the most consistent and logical characters so far. Everyone else seems to fluctuate wildly between insanity and downright stupidity. Hawkgirl was mildly more useful than shes been all season when she... carried Jax into the prison... that one time. And he promptly fucked up his leg again after a short sprint. We get the obligatory you still have your human side Sarah nonsense as her character continues to flounder in total weakness. Can I also bring up how she couldnt just shoot the two guards escorting Stein to the fusion room?Ray was more palatable this time simply because he actually did something mildly badass.All in all it felt... better than the previous  episodes. But all in all its still more of the same. All the team has been doing this far is fixing their own fuck ups. Returning the timeline to the already shitty state. Thus far we havent improved anything.I know we have to last a whole season possibly stretching into  because fuck it the nerds will watch anything nowadays no matter how lazy its written.

6716909,0,t3_47mtls,Based on the other comments this seems to be an unpopular opinion but I honestly found this episode underwhelming. There was so much they couldve done with this concept but instead they split the team into three groups and only one went in the interesting direction Sara and Rip the other two storylines felt like unnecessary character drama.While I had been hoping for Heatwave to get more focus his arc this episode just seemed... off. It seems as though there is no way to round out his character without diminishing his traits that we the fans like about him and he just seems more flat the more focus he gets. Hopefully I get proven wrong about this later on but thats my current feelings on the matter.I personally think the whole team shouldve stuck together and fought as a resistance the whole runtime but I realize that would have eaten up the budget I think I just discovered the reason why the Arrowverse has so many random drama plots.,LegendsOfTomorrow,d0e34hw,6,t5_37x73

I also love the MoTW episodes because it feels like an issue of the Flash and I know most of the villains.Also Zoom is just a lot more intimidating than the Reverse flash and I fucking love speedsters so Id want more of them.

I had seen these teasers and then kind of just forgot about it not wanting to look to much into it and get spoiled before the show was even out and I originally thought this show was meant to fill the gap between ArrowFlashs season breaks during the holidays. When this holiday season came and went I was confused thinking maybe I was off by a year and it was going to air next season. Of course to my suprise they started while both shows were returning so I tuned in to realize neither Barry or Oliver were going to be regulars and it was going to be its own show on its own. ,LegendsOfTomorrow,d0qvoyp,2,t5_37x73

Savage had a whole laboratory and was implied to have been experimenting on inmates for some time.But it seemed like we were explicitly shown him using the syringe to pull directly from the meteorite. There was no mixing and brewing no colourful liquid dripping through a succession of glass apparatuses no combining meteorite juice with Hawkgirl blood sample  or any other chemical cocktail. Thats what made me think it was the meteorite itself that somehow drove the bird transformation  and got me thinking about why  rather than it merely being a base component that Savage used in his experimentation.,LegendsOfTomorrow,d0yrnfy,1,t5_37x73

6916905,0,t3_4af89v,I was so excited when I first heard Vandal Savage was going to be the villain for this show. One of my favorite villains and in Demon Knights even somewhat of an antihero! Casper Crump I also thought was a good casting.    The problem with the show which has been echoed here in other threads is that the show seems to be wasting opportunities to show his brilliance his calculation his ability his longlived wisdom. Others have said that the team has been presented now with multiple opportunities to kill him and they either dont take it a couple times now mishandle how theyre going to take it Kendra going alone or trust that what little they did will do the trick Rip walking away from the explosion. And while I see that those are problematic the main problem with it is this the plot is undone by the teams own incompetence when they should be undone by Savages abilities. I would have no problem with them confronting and nearly besting Savage in every single episode if at the end he outsmarts them outmaneuvers them outdoes them. But he doesnt. And it makes the team come off as incapable which was forgiveable the first couple episodes because theyre learning to work together but what should be happening is that Savage gets away of his accord not the teams lack of competence.     I really really really love this show. Cast is great acting is pretty on point Im pretty good with almost everything about the show but I hope this element gets tweaked soon because it feels like its wearing thin. Its also made me start hoping that Savage is caught at the end of the season and we get a different villain for season . ,LegendsOfTomorrow,d10crln,8,t5_37x73

Not long after that I realized that I was actually starting to believe that Savage founded the Time Masters and wondering about the deeper implications of each time travel move although I admit I was frustrated at how inconsistent the rules seemed to be. The reveal of the Oculus cemented this into a show I respect as much as I used to respect Doctor Who.

9918751,0,t3_5hg60k,Okay. So what is RFs endgame? I think all along hes been wanting to go home. Maybe since Eddie shot himself he cant do it because if your ancestor dies before having kids you arent ever born. Thus he needs the Spear of Destiny to reset reality the way that he wants it because maybe hes tried undoing things but Time Wraiths keep coming after him making it impossible.I think Mick is seeing Captain Cold because Gideon is helping him with his brain damage he had after all the fuckery from the time masters and hallucinations are a byproduct of the healing. Rips got amnesia and thinks his plot lines and characters that hes coming up with are stories not actual memories. Or maybe Rip intentionally erased his memories to keep any knowledge he had about the Spear of Destiny a secret like the family of blood episodes from Doctor Who this would explain why Darhk and co are coming after him.

His main drive was constantly seeking an escape from his life becoming a super villain rewriting history finally killing himself Thats why his dad was a legitimate threat but beyond that theres really nothing concrete to him.  That can be fixed and he could be fleshed out but most of Snarts history is already known to us.  They cant bring him back without invalidating his development. Saras the other side of the coin here she just started her arc.  Prior to S she had no drive no motivation and no real will to live or overarching purpose.  The first glimmer of character we see in her is holding a knife to Rips throat and demanding he save her sister.  I fully believe that Sara was on to Rips plan for the legends from the start and didnt give a damn.  Now though Saras holding the show together in a way Snarts character never could. ,LegendsOfTomorrow,dddvnx3,9,t5_37x73

10720411,1,t3_5tawis,Arrow gt Legends gt Flash gt SupergirlArrow is much better again which is great. Season  is such an awesome throwback to season  and to many other characters across the  previous seasons. Eventually theyre going to hit the arc where Prometheus becomes the main problem again. The mystery behind the character is leaving everyone wondering. I personally think all the episodes have been solid so far this season.Legends has such a cool set up for villains. The intros for the last two episodes with Mick and Damien were such a nice change. Im happy Rip is back but I do hope they get him back to normal. Looking forward to any other surprises theyll throw at us.I think everyone was waiting for Wally to become Kid Flash throughout season . Now that we have him its great. The next episode looks very promising. Same thing as Arrow where were all waiting to hit that main finishing arc with Prometheus but instead its Savitar for Flash. Barry is going through an arc where he trains Wally. Although it is necessary to a certain extent it feels like a lot to sit through.Supergirl was great for the first couple of episodes since Superman was there. Since his absence I havent enjoyed it much at all. I love the universe for these shows and a lot of the characters theyve introduced. The problem with the shows is season length. With  episodes a season its very hard to keep the show consistently good along with proper pacing. Arrow is bouncing back from the terrible previous season and doing a great job. Legends has drastically improved since getting rid of Savage and the hawk people. The Flash and Supergirl both follow the same formula where a new villain comes to town each week and they take them down. Each show has its respective amount of filler but I do find that Supergirl and The Flash have been particularly bad for the most part out of the  shows this year. ,LegendsOfTomorrow,ddlqbx4,3,t5_37x73
10724600,0,t1_ddm3up1,Yeah I wouldnt mind Thawne being on Legends on and off for another season. I wouldnt want him as the Big Bad but in and out plotting in the background because at the end of the day hes only here because he needs to get the Black Flash off his ass so he can go back to messing with Barrys life. But him encountering the Legends or just having his own short arcs behind the scenes to help set up something on Flash would be great.. Then in the last season bring him back to Flash in force not just appearances here and there as the Big Bad. Because Eobard deserves that to be the final villain. Plus he seems to be canonically as well judging by that Flash vanishes in Crisis newspaper.And as far as Merlyn..........at this point it wouldnt surprise me if he wants less to be Ras al Ghul again and more to bring Tommyhis wife back to life. I mean did you see how pathetic his life had become? He was just sitting in his shitty apartment drinking and watching TV. Handless and alone in the world. All of his machinations had left him with NOTHING. I could really buy him wanting a genuine clean slate which he alluded to when he tried to convince Sara to help the Legion. Or at least a second chance with the ones he loved and failed in present day. And maybe as a sidenote reforming the League even if not under his leadership because he genuinely seemed to believe they were a necessary thing.And Rip.....well Evil Rip is really just regular Rip with some adjusted attitudes. He doesnt give two shits about the team and hes accepted that time is always awful for someone and that hes been a failurepawn for a large portion of his life. He figures theres no point to any particular timeline any version of history because....time doesnt care. Only people do. So whats the point? Just enjoy yourself and try and make things better for YOU because its not like if you help others its going to fix things for everyone hell if you help one person that persons kid could end up killing the kid of someone else you helped. Nothing you do will ever make it all perfect. Its not an entirely unsympathetic viewpoint if more than a tad nihilistic. And he seems a lot more...relaxed less weight of the world on his shoulders stress. So I could actually see Rip even if they save him and give him back his original memories still adopting that view and doing villainous things. Just with a tad more remorse as far as the crew goes.,LegendsOfTomorrow,ddm5vcz,6,t5_37x73

Last few episodes have been great because they were centered on the Legion the most charismatic part of the show. This time they reverted to the typical Legends formula of Mick slings oneliners Sara does her best Captain Kirk impression Nate and Ray bumble through history and Vixen disagrees with everybody until she conveniently doesnt. Doesnt help that the action was just downright goofy apart from Damiens duels with Arthur and Ray those were okay and it gets the historical aspect so obscenely WRONG.

11078382,0,t1_denpw8d,Sadly as much as I loved Laurel I agree with you with there being too many revivals hence why I hope Earth Laurel reforms. That way wed get Laurel back without using the same tricks. By the way if you havent been watching Arrow this season you should reconsider. Not gonna lie Felicity is still annoying as ever but thankfully theyve given up on Olicity itself this season and the story flashbacks included and action has been significantly improved. Im honestly rating this season a  the downsides are Laurel being dead and Felicity not being deadgone. I was skeptical of Dinah but shes grown on me. Its honestly as good as the first season though the second season is still the best. ,LegendsOfTomorrow,denq38u,1,t5_37x73

Season  and season  Felicity is really what turned me off of Arrow and seeing her in a costume potentially playing a huge role in LoT even for an episode does not sit well with me.

11288628,0,t3_60rx8x,That final scene.....That shouldve led towards the following imoMerlyn wishes Tommy back. But it backfires on him. Tommy has become batshit insane and is Prometheus this cant be done anymore.Darhk wishes to survive the fight against Green Arrow. Cold wishes to survive the S explosion.Mick wishes his family back to life.Eobard wishes his existence back.Then something unexpected happen. They cant use the spear twice. So the second step of their plans get foiled. They recruit a new team member to have him use the spear for them. But during this quest the legends stop them and take the spear back. This way we actually get a win for the legion and the lots save the day in the end by taking the spear back before they create a crazy new reality. ,LegendsOfTomorrow,dfbjsv2,4,t5_37x73

He filmed more episodes as a guest star this year than he had the previous  years put together so availability wasnt the issue. He signed a contract as a series regular which means that regardless of whatever life he has outside of acting he legally had to be there when they wanted him. It was the writers decision to take this direction with the character and in retrospect it just looks like a pointless creative misstep. ,LegendsOfTomorrow,dfxbn8o,1,t5_37x73
