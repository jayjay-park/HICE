7943730,0,t3_4nvxju,Another dataset run today with brand new magnetron before SSD stuff arrives. Beam deflection once again observed and recorded. Only one problem...with no change other than magnetron and its manufacturer...beam deflection was reversed. Double and triple checked test stand...all ok. Same test stand power supply cavity etc. I have no explanation for this. While deflection is good reversal is not. Means I dont know enough yet. At least theres only one component that changed the magnetron.,QThruster,d48y6sc,1,t5_3f0hl

Slow return with air turbulence more likely than mechanical stickiness but not ready to make that call until more testing is done. ,QThruster,d4w70z9,7,t5_3f0hl
8152196,0,t1_d4wjml1,Some designs have the magnetron sending microwaves down a waveguide into the frustrum. Would this potentially reduce this damage?,QThruster,d4wklva,1,t5_3f0hl
8152381,0,t1_d4wklva,Not by just using waveguides the reflections from the cavity would still reach the magnetron. A circulator is a passive device that redirects the reflections into a dummy load. This is more easily used with waveguide or coaxial feeds of the RF to a cavity. Direct injection as I am doing is the toughest on the mags. Ive overused  others before but got many hours of use at of them before they quit oscillating.,QThruster,d4wlfuh,1,t5_3f0hl
