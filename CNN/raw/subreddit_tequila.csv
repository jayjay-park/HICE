498305,0,t3_1ztvq7,i am assuming you are not trying to become known as a tequila bar so the following are suggestions for tequilas that are more easily availableasked for by nontequila nerds i would carry full flights of patron and don julio. these arent the best tequilas out there but they are the most well known and likely to move quickly avion is solid but not spectacular reasonably priced and easy drinking el tesoro and fortaleza are excellent tequilas that are not too obscure and reasonably priced. a tequila lover who sees these at your bar wont be disappointed one topshelf premium tequila like don julio  or el tesoro paradiso  for those with plenty of disposable income,tequila,cfwwspg,5,t5_2ri8c
532507,0,t1_cg0jnbh,Im hoping the  proof market opens up too.  Especially if it is the single barrel variants.   Talking with Tomas and Chad of the quite amazing The Wine Club in SF  he can set you up with any of the Ocho products down to the specific releasefield the single barrel releases are specifically made by the master distiller and in Ochos case Tomas tasting single barrels until they find one that is extraordinary.The rest will be mixed to make the normal releases wherein the single barrels are reserved for the really special barrels.Note that Tapatio has  a  proof blanco.    I would love for Carlos to release a single barrel cask strength variant of Excelencia.,tequila,cg0sx2h,2,t5_2ri8c

7169283,0,t3_49scja,Picked up a bottle of their Anejo here in San Diego.  after taxes Unfortunately no extra anejo with this branding but G has officially crossed the border per their facebook page. I talked to the guy at Old Town Liquor amp Deli which is basically a tequila super store and he said that they are expecting bottle of G within the next week or two. Im new to tequila but this stuff is pretty easy to drink. Ive had only a few tequilas to compare it to. One being el jimador anejo boy was that a mistake the other two being Jose Cuervo Reserva de la Familia extra anejo and  anejo. This isnt quite as smooth at the Jose Cuervo and it really shouldnt be but it is much smoother than the . Good sipper for sure. Cant wait to get my hands on the G Extra Anejo though!,tequila,d1t2wga,2,t5_2ri8c
7266256,0,t1_d243sjr,Yea Im not a fan of aged mezcal since the nuances tend to be obliterated by the aging. I definitely want the bottle though or any from the Sangre de Vida line!

I was tempted to get dragones they wanted  for it but I just couldnt justify spending that much on one bottle especially when I prob will buy one more at some point when Im here. Im debating buying grand centanrio extra anejo seems like they have it for around  but Ive never tried it so idk if Ill like it plus what is the price point for that tequila?,tequila,d27gwdr,1,t5_2ri8c
7310102,0,t1_d0uqu6k,I actually got a pour of this at a tequila bar in Atlanta last night. The blanco I had was incredibly vegetal pepper grass fresh agave. Hints of citrus just momentarily if at all.  The nose was like burying your face in a fresh lawn in spring. Ive never had a vegetal tequila like this before.  The finish was really smooth and dryclean. No real lingering aftertaste.   Very unique and completely different than most blancos Ive had. Nearly the polar opposite of Casa Noble and dryercleaner than DJ. ,tequila,d293xh8,1,t5_2ri8c

7592358,0,t3_4jb4nm,Casa Dragones is always a safe bet for a gift. This is a Joven however. If it has to be AejoIf you want something he probably has definitely not had before Pasote is probably the hottest new item on the scene but the Aejo is decidedly the weakest of the  still good though. Kah Extra Aejo is really good much better than the mainline Kah actually and about el Tesoro th would also be a really solid choice but its getting harder to find because everyone on this sub bought it all. Tears of Llorona is also on the rare side but amazing. Does he like  has he had mezcal? Youll find profiles much closer to  scotch here with a lot of varied amazing profiles. ,tequila,d357oiu,7,t5_2ri8c
