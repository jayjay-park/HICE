1639404,0,t3_2d3y5z,I got a new to me camera app on my galaxy s. To me the HDR photos look more lively and colors less flat. Im afraid that when my trip is over Im going to have a ton of shitty HDR photos and wish Id stuck to regular ones. The album is a few examples of both HDR and normal photos of the same subjects. I know I could just set it to keep the unprocessed photos but then Im dealing with  photos instead of  and storage space is sort of an issue because its a long trip. Im only seeing these on my phone. Do they look shitty on a monitor?,shittyHDR,cjlt8jr,1,t5_2utlu

Speaking of which its at night so why not use a longer exposure and deal with some shadows  you dont have a whole lot of contrast in those shots as you have them so a single exposure could have more drama than an HDR composite ,shittyHDR,cos9gab,5,t5_2utlu

10471521,0,t3_5pzhrx,So Ive been working on doing proper HDR images to bring out details in scenes with tricky lighting conditions i.e. what HDR is meant to be used for. I do exposure bracketing in my camera then use either Lightrooms builtin HDR function or MacPhuns Aurora HDR software.For this one I used the latter. I really like the detail it brought out in the stonework but fear I might have pushed it too farespecially given the halo effect around the top of the pilon.Here are two examples from the same photo session where I feel the effect was closer to what I was going for The Thames facing west The Thames and the HMS Belfast,shittyHDR,dcv1z46,2,t5_2utlu
