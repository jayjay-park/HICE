5977137,0,t1_cy34d3r,I feel like the trailers pushed hard for him being force sensitive at least the first one but the whole movie I was waiting for him to realize it. I wont be disappointed if he isnt he was still my favorite character. His comment to Han about lets use the force was the only thing I can think of but thats flimsy at best,theforceawakens,cy34tzs,1,t5_34emg
5977400,0,t1_cy35zku,I would like to think of him as developing multiple personality disorder in regards to the two halves of the force.  He is the loosest of cannons.  Aaaaannd....When it comes to these stories mirroring each other damn was he swiftly violent upon finding out Finn had female help.  He knew of her awakening and overreacts to try to prove his faith to the dark.  A sith figure in the first film of the trilogy appearing to have more to the back story in regards to the upstart Jedi than meets the original eye.... Hrmmm,theforceawakens,cy362lg,1,t5_34emg
5978429,0,t1_cy3ailn,First he was definitly skilled in the art of fighting with a Virbotonfa and found an enemy where the fight would be funand secound he might think that Fin was so skilled that he could reflect the blaster back with the lightsaber. which would have bin a bad day for mr. Stormtrooper.,theforceawakens,cy3ax1b,2,t5_34emg
5980125,0,t3_3xcf56,Honestly I was so disappointed by this movie I probably wont bother seeing the other .  I only saw this one because I had the opportunity to see it for free.  If I really wanted to watch A New Hope I wouldve gone home and found the DVD.  Kylo Ren is a total bitch He throws temper tantrums on par with those of a  year old and he got the shit kicked out of him by a girl that had no idea how to fight with a lightsaber or how to use the force yet shes suddenly better than he is despite having absolutely no training and him having decades of training and aside from a few things that are new and that had potential it seemed too much like A New Hope.  Early on youve got a resistance instead of rebel leader that gets captured by the First Order instead of Empire.  He sends his droid out to get help while he gets captured and tortured.  Difference  Lea was stronger than he was.  She never gave up info while he did.  Next we have Rey a scavanger instead of farmer on a desert planet.  She finds the droid and suddenly her home is attacked by the first order thats looking for it difference  Shes actually at the attack.  Luke wasnt there.  She and Poe Poe is one of the few new elements of the movie I think run into Han Solo Instead of Ben Kenobi who takes them to find the Resistance.  The new characters are given Anakin Skywalkers Lightsaber like how Luke was given his fathers lightsaber and then they have to go destroy the Star Killer Base Instead of Death Star.  Han Solo is killed during a confrontation with the bad guy and they blow up the Star Killer Base by having an XWing fly into a small opening and shoot it up from the inside.  I mean come on.  Aside from some minor dialogue that amounted to nearly nothing in the grand scheme of the movie theres really only  minutes out of  thats actually original.  Im happy I didnt have to pay to see that.,theforceawakens,cy3ixoh,-5,t5_34emg
5983830,0,t3_3xddt9,Ill be honest in the fact i can ignore most of these issues due to the reboot nature of the film and the rush to build interest for the following films. i enjoyed the film very much but i find it completely stupid that two amateurs could beat a trained force and lightsaber user the force is being used to fill plot holes which is not a good sign. Say what you will about Lucas but no one ever picked up a LS and just became good with it without training this insults the entire idea of the jedi and sith mastering their skills if the force is the only measure of skill.I hope this is going to be a situation where we look back at the lucas films and say yh this is when things happened for a reason and not to progress the story.,theforceawakens,cy40fc1,1,t5_34emg
5984814,0,t1_cy43n08,I see what youre saying. We arent told in A New Hope why Obi Wan is there. But we are told that he knew Lukes father and were given some interesting information when Lukes uncle talks about him being a crazy hermit. So yeah we dont know why hes there but were given some connection to him and the explanation in the prequel sort of falls out naturally from this theres no need to reach. There isnt really any connection given between the Millenium Falcon and Rey or the planet shes on so it seems much more coincidental.Going back to Obi WanAnakin I dont think the timing was too convenient. They were two situations that needed to be dealt with at the same time for the same reason. Obi Wan was suddenly without a master and Anakin had been up for consideration but the council had already basically said no and now the main person who was fighting on his behalf Qui Gon was gone. The last part I kind of agree with but my understanding is that the council directs but doesnt necessarily give orders to Jedi Knights? If thats true then theres really no issue. If not then obviously its problematic.You make a good point about Han tracking it down. My only comment is it would have been nice if they slipped in an explanation like that. A simple How did you find us?? All you had to do was start er up. You dont think I built in precautions for situations like this? would have been so easy and gotten rid of any doubt.Hope Im not coming off like an ass just interesting to hash these things out haha.,theforceawakens,cy452l2,1,t5_34emg

5986500,0,t3_3xfnl6,Just wouldnt make sense.  I hope shes just a force sensitive person that Luke was seeking out though.  It would be refreshing to get away from the Skywalker family at least a little bit.  Otherwise its just a strange rearranging of JacenJaina.She could be Lukes daughter but the reason for him leaving her on Jakku would be weird though.  I get that Luke wouldnt have taken her with him after how he failed with his nephew who was likely his first padawan.  But when he went off to find the Jedi temple wouldnt he have just left her with Leia?I believe Luke sought the Temple to figure out how to train new Jedi properly.  Remember his only experience with training for the force was as a young adult in a swamp with freaking Yoda.  Theres no way he would have the knowledge and tools to just start training kids which is why he failed so miserably when he got ahold of such a strong padawan as Ben Solo.  And failure would have been good reason for him to stay away from a possibly stronger Rey.,theforceawakens,cy4d0os,3,t5_34emg
5986803,0,t3_3xg2zx,we never even saw Vader kill anyoneOff camera Vader hunted down and killed all the Jedi on camera besides committing genocide on the tuskan raiders and the kids at the jedi temple and decapitating Dooku he kills at least  people in the first movie plus torturing his own daughter. He tortures and nearly kills han strangles at least  of his top generals tried to kill luke twice and finally kills the emperor. Vaders body count is way more than Rens. In Empire you saw the exact moment Vader starts having doubts when Lukes escapes from Cloud City i believe in the second movie Ren will start on the road to redemption when he finds out Reys is his sister.,theforceawakens,cy4eg6k,4,t5_34emg
5989437,0,t3_3xh95z,Im just glad that he died near a bottomless pit and then fell into the pit. All the major Star Wars deaths have to involve a bottomless pit somehow and it makes me happy that they stuck to the tradition.,theforceawakens,cy4qvlv,1,t5_34emg

5997721,0,t1_cy5q3av,I made this thread as a bit of funIts one of the few ways I can think of at least on how I could possibly come to like Kylo Ren.

6001769,0,t1_cy30s67,They wont ignore the Prequels because theyre canon. Yes they ranged from godawful to decent but they are part of the Star Wars lore and to completely ignore them moving forward would be an insult to the good aspects that they brought to the franchise.  ,theforceawakens,cy6d1uz,1,t5_34emg
6006003,0,t3_3xpkcf,As you stated the timeline really throws this theory out of whack.   Personally I think that Rey is more likely to be Han and Leias child mimicking the originals in a lukeleia sort of way. They saw Kylo ben drawn to the darkside and didnt want to risk it happening to Rey so they sent her to a place where they thought she would be safe maybe to never know that she was force sensitive or maybe to wait it out until Luke was found and she could begin training under him. For me it explains the awkward job offer from Han to Rey Han knows she is his daughter and wants to get to know her but cant tell her the truth for some reason. Also explains the moment she and Leia share when they all return to base after the final attack scene thats the first time they meet but Leia seems to have a fondness towards Rey that doesnt befit meeting someone for the first time. Although it could just be a mutual understanding that they both lost someone important to them. ,theforceawakens,cy6x1qo,2,t5_34emg
6007048,0,t1_cy70lyk,I think its a logical and necessary step for the story to progress. The New Republic was actually stronger than the First Order prior to the firing of that weapon. I dont believe the New Republic will be entirely gone in the future episodes but it will be weak and definitely feel the pressure so to speak. And I think that its not important for the route they are going. This new trilogy seems to be more focused on the mystery of the Force rather than the politics and I really like that. Im really interested in why Luke sought out the first Jedi temple how old Snoke is and whowhat he really is why Kylo was seduced despite Vader being redeemed and what Mazs future role is. ,theforceawakens,cy71zku,3,t5_34emg
6011707,0,t3_3xpm07,leia is definitely reys mom.  leia had the force so does rae.  i dont think hans is her daddy but clearly she was saying everything Hans said at the same time and kylo and reys interaction was very emotional  so is prob hans also.  id like to think leia was a bar hopping whore popping them out but its likely rey got hidden on jokku for her own safety or its some sort of secret and thats why she was waiting and reluctant to leave.   ,theforceawakens,cy7nx13,1,t5_34emg
6016380,0,t3_3xvrn4,I agree with you on most points. People need to chill. It was good. And a great step towards some fresh ideas. The plot never really mattered in this movie. The characters did and every character in the movie was unique. Even Phasma who didnt get much screen time was still visually cool. I also think a lot more plot was in the movie that people realize. That dream sequence showed raised a lot of questions that will be answered in time. But for now I am going to enjoy the movie. I have a post similar to yours. So I get the frustration with the haters. ,theforceawakens,cy89v91,1,t5_34emg

6028543,0,t1_cy6vl27,It seemed more like he didnt have control at the moment. Like he was going through the motions but wasnt really as in tune with the force as he thought he was.  After all this is like  minutes in movie time of him killing his father.  Destined for the dark side or not he seemed pretty close to neutral on the bridge.  He didnt have very long to process his own actions and even if it was only subconsciously Im sure he felt like something was wrong.  Maybe thats enough to fuck with his force control.,theforceawakens,cy9v1jx,1,t5_34emg
6040140,0,t3_3y4otr,Almost everything in the OP is assuming nothing significant can happen between cuts in sequence or just blatantly ignoring emotional decision making and the force not a joke. The movie ran at  hours and  minutes. Leagues too long for your average childrens movie the main target audience for all Star Wars movies.  Do we really need shots of Kilo Ren force running goofy to cut in front of Rey and Finn? no. Its assumed he found a way.  Do we need to see shots of the best pilot in the resistance possibly the greater galaxy Po trying to aim the disabled ship as close to the town as possible with one wing left? No. Hes the best and we have no cap on what that means in this universe...nothing to do with the Force.  Rey is an adventurous spirit. She would rather get the adventure of following through with BB than some food. What would she even do with the free time she would get without having to hunt for food? its a desert planet with nothing on it and she has no friends. Its a no brain decision for anyone with half a heart and the ability to reason beyond food.  Chewy was distraught but not enough to kill himself with the planet imploding below him. He can grieve later. Besides...Its not something Han wouldnt tell him to do anyway.  I do agree. The last shot with Luke and Rey with the  degree pan felt like a crap relic of s blockbuster cinema. But maybe that was intentional too.  Eulogies are horrible to watch...no speech can capture the memory of Han and it was unnecessary. Id rather remember him for my own reasons...not be told why we loved him. Also he abandoned the resistance to smuggle for fun. He deserved about as much a eulogy as anyone else who died during the attack. Hows Luke been eating on the rock? Idk...fish? This is the stupidest list. Why did I bother. Screw me. ,theforceawakens,cybdg7y,6,t5_34emg
