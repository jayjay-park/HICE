Past Turkey and arguably Czech any foreign currency other then dollars is pretty useless. Dollars are the easiest to work with as we found converting from say euros or pounds to the local currency they tended to convert via the Dollar so you lost out twice in the exchange. If youre in a tight situation without local money most will take dollars as well. I heard people warning that you shouldnt convert your money with the guys either side of the boarders. I understand what they meant about not getting the best exchange rate but it is by far the easiest and most useful way to do it. You can get rid of all your now defunct money from the last country and get some currency on board for the new place without having to get to a city or town that may or may not have anywhere to convert. Just an added point. We had  currency cards with us one Visa and one MasterCard. Even in places where they accepted Visa or MasterCard they still didnt always work which nearly fucked us when we were in Turkmenistan. When I do it again Ill planning on just taking a massive amount of USD in cash for the whole journey. ,mongolrally,cvlk359,1,t5_2s7j0
8835964,0,t1_d75byv9,Hello. Do you need one more guy? I would be willing to join you. I am from the USA and have a lot of driving experience Ive driven across the USA three times. I am interested in your route lots good. But as I am fascinated by all things Russia I would also want to see Moscow and Volgograd. But no big deal if we cant make it to those cities. ,mongolrally,d79yile,1,t5_2s7j0
