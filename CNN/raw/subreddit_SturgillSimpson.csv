9958656,0,t3_5i381f,I have seen it on eBay once in a while for about . And I think its a burned CD. I tried calling some of the independent record stores in and around Lexington and had no luck. I live in California so I wasnt actually able to go to the stores. If you find it PM me I would love to get a copy. I think I have read it was put out by the band without a label. There are a lot of great YouTube videos. You can hear an original version of Oh Sarah. I loved every song I heard from them. Its a bummer it cant really be found. ,SturgillSimpson,db5mzwr,3,t5_35bxm
