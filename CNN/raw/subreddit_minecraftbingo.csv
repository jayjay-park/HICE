2254506,0,t1_clpt9fx,Oh cmon Brian air your disasters XDI cant be the only one that loves watching you fail and I mean that in the absolute NICEST way possible. Some of my favorite videos from you have been ones where youre panicking and stumbling through things. OF course ones where youre more organized and kick ass are cool too but the comedy of the fail videos are pretty great sometimes. Plus stay tuned tonight Im going to upload a video of  my first attempt at one of these challenges and I bet I fail more spectacularly than you do. D,minecraftbingo,clqdnn4,3,t5_31q73

The first time I ran it i did great with mobs but forgot to pick up an extra piece of tree it fell into water without me noticing so i couldnt smelt the iron. This week is a little less interesting because there is basically only one path to care about I love the weeks where there are a couple paths that all can be run.   ,minecraftbingo,cmkcch8,1,t5_31q73

2725305,0,t3_2r4uo1,Alright so Ive spent a month trying to reconcile my love for putting up my Bingo vids in the first couple of days with the need to be a fancypants Strangelands YouTuber and not upload three videos all at once because quality and Ive hit on a solution. I post the videos here unlisted and then as the week goes by I make it public to appease the Strangelanders yay.Seed  in ms  This seed is all about who finds a rabbit first.

I hope people take it in the spirit in which it was intended and Im not immediately disqualified!

5361252,0,t3_3o5n46,Anyone else having trouble with seed ?Im playing on MC ..  I start the map like I did on the two previous seeds   and   but after the initialization of the map Im taken outside as usual.The first time I tried  I got notified that Kjotleik fell from a high place. When I respawned I was in the   seeds map. Onscreen I still saw the seed as  but when I walked around I found Ive been there before which I had playing  .On second and third attempts at starting the  seed I got placed in the barrierprison high up above the map but I never got teleported to a spawnpoint. The time never started. I had to go into creative mode and fill up my card to get bingo just in order to get back to the controlroom.    EDIT When I die either by the killcommand or by letting mobs kill me I respawn in the   seed map even though I was in  before getting killed.If anyone knows what is going on Id appreciate a tip or two.  ampnbsp  I have recorded some footage but not uploaded it anywhere. Its over an hour and a half duh. I can edit it and upload but I have no time to edit before saturday unfortunately.Ill try to play again on thursday..,minecraftbingo,cvwylae,1,t5_31q73
5368869,0,t1_cvvomoz,gt I did okay on this one but disaster struck at the end when I got two gold for the sword but then one was leeched off by the gold ingot on the card. Oops. Thats the second time Ive forgotten about that.Ha!  The only reason I remembered to grab three myself was being fresh off a practiced seed where I needed to get three skeleton bones to grow wheat because of one being taken automatically by the card.,minecraftbingo,cvxxlpy,1,t5_31q73
