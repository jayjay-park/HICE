11470467,0,t3_63qaww,Just to clarify this isnt my point of view  I was on the blue team. I this from the replay. That would be pretty embarrassing if I made that owngoal.Everyone on both teams whiffed the ball trying to shootsave it then this guy hit it towards his own net. Trying to get around it he hit it too soon making it look like he was trying to carry it across and angling it right into his own net.It looks like he did it on accident purpose but immediately after he spammed ! right before he ragequit.EDIT typo. kms,BadRocketLeagueGoals,dfw670u,54,t5_3bn73
