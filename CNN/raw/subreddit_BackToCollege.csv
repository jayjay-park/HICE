3037289,0,t1_coct4vq,Most of astronomy is programing. Its  days of telescope time and  days of convincing a computer to do a calculation or find a needle in  billion stacks of needles. if you are already a skilled and experienced programmer consider trying to hire on one of these private space companies. Or hell. CERN is hiring programmers. Go live in Geneva and help smash particles together. You dont have to be a scientist to work on science projects.,BackToCollege,coctbld,1,t5_36cti

10202922,0,t1_dc0dte5,OH OK will you be able to work as a electrician while going to school?Well its the pay for one because Im not even bringing home k But Ive wondered if it might be the state Im living in. And Im also just not happy with the work environment.  But Im pretty good at some math but the more advance I would have to study more on. I would probably have to get a part time retail job going back but I would have to pay for it the schooling which I figured I could get on a student loan?  I appreciate that Ive always been skeptical about it. But Ive herd the same thing. I know of Computer Engineering but not sure what its about?    ,BackToCollege,dc0k3xj,1,t5_36cti
10216816,0,t3_50rhya,I was in your exact same position and now Im working toward a Computer Engineering degree. What I would do if I were youaStudy programming for a couple of months and try to complete freecodecamp.combGo to a coding bootcampIf after that you think cant find a jobthink it would be unlikely then I would apply for a CS degree. But I find a bootcamp much better if you think about opportunity cost.,BackToCollege,dc24tmp,1,t5_36cti

If the barrier to entry is low then theres going to be more competition for your job in the labor market and usually lower lifetime earning potential and job growth.People like to glorify the trades on Reddit but I doubt very many of those people singing the praises of being a tradie are actually working in those fields themselves. Yes being a plumber or welder pays well and has nice benefits and there is demand for these jobs in certain parts of the country...but think for a moment why that is? Because these jobs are physically demanding sometimes dangerous horrific coworker culture and shitty manual labor talk to a plumber in his s and see how he feels about his work.My grandma told me something that always stuck with me Work smart not hard and use your brain not your back.If your dad is an engineer then you have mathematics in your blood.Get this idea of being an LPN out of your head. Please if you still need convincing then workshadow an LPN or get your patient care tech  nurses aide certification and go work a couple shifts in a nursing home. Ill give you the cliffs notes version of that story its fucking soulcrushing work.Set your sights higher. Talk to your dad about what he does and if he has any words of advice. I wish I grew up with an engineer for my dad. Id have a  year head start in where i want to be.,BackToCollege,dgp6oaw,1,t5_36cti
