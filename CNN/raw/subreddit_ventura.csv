8578120,0,t3_4xaboi,Its behind their dumb old paywall of course but its not too tricky to get around it. The President of Brooks was fired and  of the  board members resigned. This follows the recent news that the renovations in their various new spaces downtown were being put on hold because of money issues.Brooks is not what is was a couple years ago. In  they had  students. A year ago it was down to  so it was in a death spiral. The school was bought last year by GP Homestay which makes its money by placing foreign exchange students. So my guess is they saw Brooks as something they could sell to rich ChineseBrazilianKoreanRussian parents looking to send their kids off on a study abroad program to earn a Bachelors Degree or Masters Degree. I put those in quotes because Brooks is accredited by ACICS which is not something to brag about.Their current campus is way up the Avenue. Moving everything downtown would have made it more attractive but it sounds like they simply dont have the money to get it done. Meanwhile City Hall was trying to help them giving GP Homestay a very good deal on rent and keeping all the negotiations secret until the deal was finalized and slipped into the consent calendar for the February  meeting of the City Council.This caused some headaches. There are a handful of local nonprofits like Focus on the Masters that rent space at  Poli Street right behind City Hall. When the city announced Brooks was moving in the nonprofits were shocked to learn they were going to have to move to another floor on short notice.Its one thing to give local nonprofits like Focus on the Masters or the Ventura County Ballet a good price on rent but theres a process for nonprofits to apply for some of that sweet sweet Poli office space. Its a whole nother thing to do it for a questionable forprofit company based in Massachusetts in secret without giving any other businesses the opportunity to bid for the same sort of deal.It may all work out. If it doesnt if they pull out it could leave the city holding the bag on some halfrenovated properties.,ventura,d6dukfu,8,t5_2rkxf

If you go to vegas and play black  on the roulette table you will win but you will also lose.In reality if you live or visit Ventura or any town near the fault line you should be prepared. With the Co going into dangerously high levels the weather patterns the speeding comets that we are not able to track yet one just got really close and we had not been tracking it in our risk analysis all of these signs point to an unstable earth. Weather cycles have erased most living things before. Earthquakes have washed away beach towns with Tsunamis and if you do not think that can or will happen here you are out of your mind.As a Ventura Resident you should have the following OH SHIT PLANSEarthquakeTsunamiLoss of Electricity Power grid failNuclear Strike LA would be a prime target for our enemy or the Nuke plant in Los OsosNuke plant meltdown due to any of the aboveLoss of potable waterRaging FiresI can go on and onIn many ways we pay a lot to live in a dangerous area. We need to enjoy paradise and remember what happened before will likely happen again. Brand it global warming or just history repeating itself. We need to prepare for these things. A lot of people including myself let their guards down. We bought kits years and maybe decades ago but have we updated them made evac plans? Where will you meet your family? What supplies will you have? What if you are not home?The earth is telling us something.edit list format,ventura,d8atorg,3,t5_2rkxf
9451577,0,t3_5a3gbe,Ive done a fair amount of research about purchasing a mobile home but havent actually purchased yet.As for if its too good to be true depends on who you ask. My realtor said its not a wise investment because Mobile Homes dont appreciate like regular houses do. However from what Ive found the home will depreciate some but overall it will stay in line with the cities inflation rate. If you ask the Mobile Home sellers its the best investment ever! Affordable housing! Yay!I will very likely purchase a mobile home within the next few years because I will be living in Ventura for the foreseeable future and rent is STUPID expensive these days. Lot rent its basically HOA fees varies greatly by park and is no indicator for how well run the park is. The highest rent park is in my opinion the shabbiest looking. Its also important to note that there are four Family you dont have to be  to live there parks in Ventura. One of them is AMAZING and exceptionally clean well maintained and has very strict rules. The others do not. I wont be able to afford a HOUSE in Ventura or even a large condo for a very very long time. However purchasing a Mobile Home can happen very soon so for it it seems to make sense.,ventura,d9e1ye6,2,t5_2rkxf
