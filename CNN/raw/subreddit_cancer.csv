340693,0,t3_1xz4su,After the fact TLDR Being a cancer survivor does not make you an expert on all forms of cancer. I dont know about this guy but I have to speculate that he had a cancer that was cured by surgery. Lucky him. Also... I am angry. Be warned. There is cursing. Yikes... There is a lot to unpack here so Ill just start. Full disclosure I work in academia so I dont profit from new therapeutics but I am looking at options regarding moving into the pharma industry someday if I cant get an academic job. First I upvoted because this topic needs to be discussed. A lot of people believe that there is a grand conspiracy pharma companies only want to make money and the cure is not being researched. Essentially people believe they are being kept sick on purpose. Its a compelling argument because every lie contains a truth. Pharma companies are NOT nonprofit. They need cash to operate and they make large profits on drugs that work. Thats pretty much where the accuracy in this video ends.I know its en vogue to hate on Komen. Ive done it myself. Im no expert in business but it does seem to me that too much of their money goes toward advertising and admin. There are a ton of charities however that do put their money toward research. My salary is paid by one of them Thanks walkers!. Here I will note that I get paid less than each and every one of my high school friends even though I have a PhD and none of them do. Im not looking for sympathy just pointing out that no one is making it rain on cancer researchers so you can feel okay about the  bucks you pony up. Now lets get in to the plain factual inaccuracies. Cancer survival rates have not remained static over the last fifty years. Here is some REAL DATALooking at breast you can see that rates were dead level at about k until about  at which point they began to decline. By  the death rate dropped by at least . Now this is where I start to get mad. The guy who made this video may be unaware of these truths and just repeating shit hes been told by crackpots. This is reckless but people should know better than to take medical advice from youtube. On the other hand that  drop in death rate may be what he is calling virtually unchanged. If that is the case then FUCK YOU YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE. IF YOUR FUCKING MOTHER WAS IN THAT  YOU WOULDNT THINK IT WAS SO FUCKING INSIGNIFICANT! MOTHERFUCKER!!!!Sorry Ill compose myself. Now theres another bit of lying that goes on when you only talk about  year survival rates. Many of the new therapies give amazing responses but sadly cancer mutates and resistance emerges This is what I study in the lab. How to circumvent this.. This means that a patient with metastatic melanoma may get an extra  months of life from Vemurafenib. Not enough to affect the five year survival rate but if it was my dad with the cancer and my little brother was  months away from college graduation... Once again maybe Mr. Survivor is unaware but if he chooses to ignore this kind of progress THEN HE IS A PIECE OF HUMAN FUCKING GARBAGE. JUST BECAUSE YOU WERE LUCKY DOESNT GIVE YOU THE RIGHT TO ADVOCATE POLICIES AND TREATMENTS THAT WOULD END PEOPLES LIVES EARLIER. YOU FUCKING SMUG SHITBAG!Oops there I go again. The American AntiCancer Institute and anyone with an MD or a PhD that preys on sick people and gives them hope by telling them that they are being lied to and if they just drink some combination of beet juice and smoke a blunt that thats really their best treatment option... Well those people can all go die in a fire as far as I am concerned. This is already too long but I am going to keep going. I too have huge issues with how much cancer costs to treat. This really is a result of our economic system and not evil inherent to the pharma industry. Even with all of your donations finding new drugs is HARD and EXPENSIVE. Because of competition there is an ever narrowing window during which the companies need to make back the gt Thats actually a low estimate it costs to bring a single drug to market. The solution that I see to this problem is to increase the budget of the NIH x. Get more public money into researching cancer and the discoveries will be in the public domain and not the property of GSK. And what is the best way that you can help get us closer to this utopia? Well honestly the best way is to write and call your congressperson and tell them that the NIH matters to you and that you will be voting in the next election for the candidate with the strongest record of supporting the NIH regardless of their party. Then you could post on Facebook about how you did that and how you would be soooo proud of all your friends who do the same. But if you want to do more than that if you want to feel like you are a soldier on the ground in the war on cancer and you want to be surrounded by like minded people trying to do the same then why not support an organization that pays people like me whose entire job is do cancer research and just give away that work for all the public to see?!?!?! ,cancer,cfg2znl,11,t5_2qixx

I had it for four months before going to the hospital and getting it diagnosed because I kept thinking that the strange new pain in my knee would go away on its own. I pretty much just woke up one morning with my knee throbbing and the pain intensified over the course of the four months to the point of not being able to finally walk onstraighten my leg. I researched into it and thought it was a Giant cell tumor because cancer at my age especially in the knee didnt even cross my mind. I learned through the xray and biopsy that it was in fact cancer.

So annual mammogram and clinical exam every  months. Fast forward to my th year. Miss my mammogram because Im pregnant with my first child. Have my child in my th year and get diagnosed with cancer  weeks later. It was locally advanced by that time because I thought that the lump I had noticed was a blocked milk duct for a couple of months. Got the most aggressive treatment regime chemo bilateral mastectomy and radiation. Prophylactic bilateral oophorectomy etc. I am now Stage IV it has metastasized. I am  years old and will consider myself lucky if I see my th birthday. side note it was triple negative so more aggressive and less treatment optionsI dont want to scare you but I wouldnt wait until youre in your thirties. Your doctors are probably wanting to give you some time to adjust to the idea. Mastectomy is a pretty drastic procedure and can mess with your mind. My sister also BRCA did a prophylactic bilateral mastectomy. She was able to use a skin saving technique and kept her own nipples. I think this would make it much easier to adjust to the change. Try to convince your doctors that you are totally sure that you want this and you wont be comfortable until its done. Waiting is causing you unnecessary stress and worry. Good luck!

Older people dont recovoer as fast from these events. And your DNA has a limited number of times it can copy its self for new cells because it gets just a little bit shorter every time.

1396869,0,t3_2a3osf,Ive been on Avastin as a single agent since February  every  days and before that with Ixabepilone and Carboplatin for six rounds. After the first few migrainelike headaches I began to notice a pattern. It starts with the neck muscles and then creeps around the side of my headtemples. After a bout the muscles are sore for days. The intensity is on par with a typical migraine. Just last week I had one so severe I was vomiting for six hours. Immitrex does nothing for these headaches which is in part how we arrived at the tension headache diagnosis. Edit You describe your migraine as ocular so it would seem we have unrelated situationsI am now able to tell when one is starting and immediately wrap my head in a heated blanket pop a muscle relaxer and massage the neck and temple areas. It takes a couple hours to subside but Im usually able to stave off a full attack. I used to have the headaches every few days but now experience them  once per week or less. Ive noticed that when I sleep poorly or only get a few hours of sleep Im more likely to experience an attack. I also have debilitating muscle painfrozen joints in all major joint areas which also seems to be tied to the Avastin. This is a known but infrequent side effect of the drug. I spend a lot of time wrapped in a heated blanket which seems to help and do gentle yoga too much exacerbates the muscle pain. ,cancer,cirdmwd,1,t5_2qixx

The first are wellmoderately differentiated tumors. These tumors are very slowgrowing and amenable to a variety of therapies  both experimental and standard.  Systemic treatments such as mTor inhibitors everolimus and Kinase inhibitors Sunitinib have been approved. Octreotide and its variants such as radio labeled octreotide lutathera are experimental options. Chemo treatments such as xelodatemodar or FOLFOX can work. The second class are highgradepoorlydifferentiated and include small cell  which is unfortunately what you state is the diagnosis. These tumors are extraordinarily aggressive. They typically respond well to initial therapy Cisplatin or Carboplatin and Etoposide with a response rate of  and a duration of response of  months.  Unfortunately they respond quite poorly to second line treatment or beyond irinotecan or tipotecan as nd line a taxane as rd line. The response rates are  and duration is  months.

You are not guaranteed  the treatment and its doubleblind so youll never know.Its better to get on the chemo then after way through when you are feeling the neuropathy just push on your doctor to cut back. They have discretion for  or so I believe. Push hard if the nerve damage is strong  push real hard to stop the oxaliplatin after that halfway point.This is because ...mos vs. mos of Oxaliplatin the OX in FOLFOX appears to be JUST as effective. This is important because of the sideeffects are so strong with OX. And ... THIS ... is why this trail appears to have been kicked up.However the same halving of the FU FOLF doesnt really seem to bear out right now. This trial will help determine that.

I had never heard about a care packageI can be dense when it comes to gift giving and the like.I had another acquaintance lose their  month old just a few months ago and having an  month old myself it was pure anguish hearing that news...Now that I had some time to process some of the news I realized that one of my coworkers mother is a psychologist that specializes in individuals with cancer. I wont force this on him by any means but I think Ill at least try to get the information to him...Something else that Ive been struggling with is that my friend has asked me to tell other friends that hes sick with cancerbut he doesnt want me to share the type or that he has AIDS. Im obviously respecting his wishes but I have been struggling with choosing my words to describe the situation.Its shitty all around. But hes still in good spirits and I have to be for him. Only my worstcase mind keeps on trucking at  MPH... Hes hospitalized right now and it might be another week or two. I just man Im begging for good news in the next few days. Because he doesnt have Facebook part of the reason why its been so hard to keep in contact with him he hadnt even seen my daughter yet I tried to send him a few pictures earlier but they failed for some reason.

But I also asked my oncologist about exercising and he told me Look youre not going to be Hans and Franz here. Maybe a couple years down the road. For now just do as much as you feel is comfortable.     I also used to be athletic like you. My exercise routine was a  minutemile K. But after the steroids and the chemo and the disease itself I personally gained a crapload of fat and lost a crapload of muscle. So for me an important thing has been aerobic exercise  because not only are my muscles out of shape but I know my heart and lungs are deconditioned. Im also still anemic after the bone marrow transplant so I get winded more easily. I started doing a modified couchtok and its kicking my ass but it makes me feel so good. Its also been making me want to eat better so I downloaded MyFitnessPal to keep track of my nutrition intake. I still have a Clif Bar and an Ensure every day just to kind of make sure Im not missing any nutrients.

2301936,0,t3_2lmdwd,Since the wedge biopsy is done it sounds like they are waiting on the pathologist to make his assessment on whether it is cancer or not and if it is what type of cancer the molecular findings that will determine therapy Just to give you a bit of insight on the whole process as I know that it is very frustrating for the patient and family members once the wedge biopsy is performed it gets sent to the pathology department directly and sits in formalin for  days essential for tissue fixation. Then it gets processed by the technologist and the pathologist usually receives the slides approx  days after the biopsy. He then evaluates the slides which only have a basic stain at this point and has to decide whether he needs antibodies or moleculargenetic tests on the tissue. If the tissue is normal the diagnosis is rendered without any molecular tests. But most of the time they will perform further moleculargenetic testing and that takes about gt days. So approx  days after the biopsy the pathologist is usually able to make a final diagnosis detailing the type of cancer the molecular and genetic findings that will ultimately decide the chemotherapyradiation treatment plan for the patient if a cancer is found.However the other thing to keep in mind is that before the doctor reveals anything to the patient they usually like to gather pathologistradiologistmedical oncologistradiation oncologistsurgeon once the final diagnosis is made so they can have a wholegroup discussion and agree on the treatment plan this is what they call interdisciplinary cancer rounds and that occurs once a week usually. The reason for this is because unlike any other field in medicine cancer is actually one of the most confusing and challenging diseases to treat because there is no cure right now. So this is truly the reason why the diagnosis is often communicated a week later because they want to reach a consensus with regards to the treatment plan. However if you really want to know the diagnosis earlier you could technically ask your surgeononcologist whether a final pathology report has been rendered and if so ask for a copy.,cancer,clw8i5s,3,t5_2qixx

2522700,0,t3_2ojy8o,Its important to know what type of radiation she will be receiving. External beam radiation therapy is what we normally think of when you hear someone getting radiation for cancer treatments. This is most similar to getting a high powered xray and the patient does not remain radioactive after treatment. The patient will have a lowered immune system so it is best to be careful.There are internal radiation treatments as well. This type of treatment does have the possibility that your grandmother could remain radioactive.I think it would be best to contact your grandmothers radiation oncologist to determine what level of contact can be attained. Your OBGYN may not be aware of the different types of radiation treatments so they may not be able to answer your questions. ,cancer,cmnurot,5,t5_2qixx

I was given all of the info about the injection that out you into menopause and protects the eggs but every doctor I talked to had different opinions on the effectiveness.Side note you will probably get this info from your fertility doctor but embryos survive better than eggs so if your SO is willing and you think he is the one fertilize!One more thing I wish I had done this but there are several organizations that will help you subsidize the cost since you are harvesting due to cancer.

I felt like I had failed. I was definitely there listening and supporting but I wasnt the dramafree rock I felt she needed that night.I know people always say dont take it personally. I hear this mantra over and over again and while its good logical advice sometimes if I know shes with a friend one day but declines an invite that I extend on another day or doesnt return a call even if I know better I cant help but think Im just in denial and she just doesnt want anything to do with me after all.

Things youll be dealing with now Tumor markers  tc causes certain chemicals in your blood to show up in tests. bHCL is one that only shows up in nonseminomal tc. AFP is another and ldh those show up all the time. In my case my markers prior to testicle removal  were low afp was  bHGC was . Post op they fell to nondetectable within a week. My ldh was normal to begin with. They removed my tumor and then did a CT scan. No masses were seen anywhere else but because of the teratoma in my initial tumor they wanted to remove the lymph nodes adjacent to the testicle the ones the testicle drain into. That surgery is called an RPLND.My RPLND was done on Dec th with a FREAKING ROBOT!  Often and this depends on where you live to some extent youll receive adjunct chemo after the orchiectomy certainly if your tumor markers dont fall to normal levels post orchiectomy. My RPLND showed no Cancer in my lymph nodes so Im officially stage a.If your Cancer is seminomal theyll often use radiation to treat it. Nonseminomal Cancer doesnt give a fuck about radiation so its just surgery and chemo. Often if the Cancer has spread youll get chemo something called BEP somewhere between  rounds a round being  weeks total time.  st week chemo injections nd week you feel like shit rd week you feel better repeat. Once the chemo gets done killing all the Cancer theyll do the RPLND to clean out the dead Cancer and the teratoma which ignores chemo but grows very slow. At least sometimes they do not always. Expect lots of blood tests long term to watch your tumor markers occasional CT scans and Xrays. The good news is stage  TC can actually have a gt survival  year rate against the average person. In other words people beat the cancer and take better care of themselves as a result. On average stage  ampamp  tc is like  survival rate. Even stage  is over  survival rate.

She loved to talk about her family who lived so far away and she had never seen them since marrying my father so young. You can get an idea of what her life was like and hopefully it will bring her back to a better time and distract her from the pain etc of the cancer.  Paint her nails or get her into a nice bubble bath if possible and spoil and pamper her. Bring her her favorite foods. Snuggle up beside her.

3200640,0,t1_cotqf1h,Thanks for the reply. No unfortunately she hasnt had a full body scan since five years ago when They had diagnosed her with a fibrous dysphasia on another rib.  It has since disappeared and we are praying they had made the right diagnosis at the time. This time we had done Xray initial test which started this to rule out walking pneumonia for something else ct scan of chest and mri of liver.  Found what why think are two benign liver lesions and this rib tumor.  The surgeon had hypothesized the tumor to be either a chondroma or chondrosarcoma and said either way the rib has to come out so we didnt even biopsy it.  So foolish in hindsight and praying that will not come back to bite us...  After finding out it is actually an osteosarcoma I realize we should have gone right to a cancer center who probably would have done a biopsy and then chemo first.As far as next steps Id travel to the moon if it would cure her..,cancer,cotquww,1,t5_2qixx

In trying to make it easier for my care givers Ive put together a binder that I take with me to every appointment. The binder has phone numbers for doctorsnurses information about drugstherapies Im undergoing and in the back is a section with my Living Will and Health Care Directive.Those two documents can be downloaded from the internet and come in easy to understand forms. Depending on the state youre living in they may not even need to be notarized. So potentially this is something you can print out right there with your grandmother go through the answers with her and have her sign it.When the time comes this takes the decision out of your hands and means that other relativesnext of kin dont need to be tracked down in order to get done what needs to be done. This is a BIG deal.Call her oncologist and see if they have a patient advocate  someone who provides information about everything from wigs to transportation to financial assistance. My guess is they help with end of life issues as well.Do not try to do this on your own. Its a grueling disturbing and life changing experience for the caregiver.

For endometrial cancer this is always the most important thing and chemo and radiation are just insurance treatments.  It turns out that the chance of the cancer coning back without any additional treatment is very low lt and any additional treatments would have a very small impact on the chance of cancer coming back while giving your mom more side effects that could be harmful.

I doubt its the blame and it would seem unlikely that youd advocate robbing someone of their autonomy given what you say about both your husband and mother in law and the respect you seem to show in wanting to carry out their respective wishes. in contrast to my aunt who somehow magically not only knows whats best but also that my brother is incapable if he makes choices other than hers. And Id hope that you arent thinking that she somehow has uniquely suggested that we need to be strong in limiting his suffering as I would have hoped I made that abundantly clear as my position as well in post. So I really dont understand what point you think she has. And it certainly couldnt have been that my brother was incapable of understanding his postion when he was told the other day he wept. I can assure you that he doest routinely weep when discussing the weather.My brother has since recovered from his frightening bout of nonresponsiveness and at my urging his physicians have had a frank talk with him to make sure hes clear about his circumstances. He has since made his OWN decision to have all medical devices removed and no further reviving to take place. They think hell last a few days at most and will be gone in a few hours if certain things happen. Im sitting on a plane waiting for takeoff to be with him content that hes reached this decision of his OWN FREE WILL and not because someone with an agenda pushed him into something before he was ready although I still harbor fears that there were some quiet whispers going on that may have pushed him along.

However though she had health setbacks mentally she was mostly there for many years  it was only her last  months that she really lost that zest for life and that was I think more due to her physical limitations. My siblings and I never discussed when we should stop being aggressive over treatment but it just seemed natural for us to slide over into the just keep her comfortable mode.She didnt have a good end but i like to think that me my brother and sister visiting her almost every week in the nursing home with the grandchildren after the stroke and with dialysis by then it was a no brainer gave her some extra quality time.

We can cure quite a few cancers for example children are cured of cancer in  of cases although they may be left with significant problems in the long term.Most skin cancers are curable.  Many breast bowel and prostate cancers are also curable.  Lung cancer is the exception and most people with lung cancer die from it.That being said glioma of the brain is usually incurable although sometimes people can live for a few years.  Oligodendroglioma which was mentioned above is a particularly sensitive form of glioma where the average survival is measured in years.

Dont jump on the whole organic juicing thing  its not going to make much difference at this point and if she wants to plunk down on the couch with a bag of Doritos and a pint of Ben amp Jerrys then that is what she should do. Food makes people happy and happiness is so very important. Also once her thyroid is out her metabolism is going to shut down and the medication they give her at first probably wont pick up all the slack so shell have to watch what she eats if she doesnt want to gain a heap of weight  might as well enjoy food now.Something a lot of people dont seem to know cancer describes hundreds and hundreds of different diseases which all have their root in a cellular mutation. All they have in common is that a cell went wrong and the immune system didnt kill it. Otherwise theyre all completely different diseases and looking at them on a holistic basis is not useful. Small cell lung cancer is not like cervical cancer which is not like ALL which is not like osteosarcoma which is not like melanoma. Theyre all cancer but theyre not at all the same. Not even a littleSo thyroid cancer Very very survivable depending on type   of all thyroid cancers are papillary or follicular and these have a  survival rate if identified in the early stages. If theyre not rushing her in for surgery right this minute then shes hopefully got one of the better types and its not too far along. Im not sure Id go in for Crazy Sexy Cancer  Ive never seen it but from what I understand she had a really awful terrifying type of cancer this is why I mention the bit about cancer being a bunch of diseases  she doesnt have anything like what the woman in the film had and thats not relevant to whats happening to your boyfriends sister. Shes got what annoyingly is referred to as the good cancer. Which is a load of horseshit. None of this is good. But thyroid cancer is manageable in most cases. The treatment consists of surgery and radioactive iodine ablation. No chemo chemo doesnt work well on this type of cancer no radiation unless the cancer does not respond to the iodine this is a rare complication. The iodine treatment is exclusive to thyroid cancer  this one radioactive particle destroys thyroid cells and leaves pretty much everything else alone.Thyroid cancer patients often dont spend time on an oncology ward  Ive never been on one. They spend time on a surgical ward and then maybe they have the iodine treatment over a few days in an isolation suite in hospital mine was in the endocrine unit although often they just send them home with specific instructions about how to spend their time and staying away from people. After that shell start her longterm maintenance medication synthetic thyroid hormones. Treatment is quick and relatively okay. She wont lose her hair or become incredibly immune suppressed. Shell probably be a bit more susceptible to colds. I still get a lot of colds  but not everybody has that as a longterm issue. Treat her normally. This really is a frustrating inconvenience  its not the end of the world. I know its scary  nobodys prepared for cancer but the odds are on her side. It will continue to be a frustrating inconvenience for the next few months. Its going to be a mild inconvenience to her for the rest of her life  pills occasional blood tests and getting travel insurance can be a pain in the backside. I was well into stage II when mine was found   years later Im still here and Im healthy. Im not the exception  most of us come through pretty okay. Try to help her have as normal a time as she can now as well as once shes through treatment  just do what youd usually do. Once shes had the surgery just try to be helpful  shes going to feel weird and sore and tired and little things like running errands and bringing cups of tea help. Its sweet that youre so concerned. Take a deep breath and just try to be normal. If she wants to talk let her talk. If not then just act like its any other day. It may feel like denial but its not. Its the rational response to the situation  this is a bad time and it will pass. For all of you.,cancer,ct1lgck,5,t5_2qixx

I went in for a neck dissection to remove one lymph node for sure and explore the other lymph nodes nearby. I ended up with a bilateral neck dissection with  lymph nodes removed because they appeared enlarged when I was opened up. Its likely they saw the root of the tumor was fairly long and removed more just to be safe. Once melanoma metastasizes its extremely difficult to treat.

All we can really do is move forward and keep taking in the joys of each day.  When my Dad found out the Cancer had spread to his lungs bones and brain after being told he was all clear he was fond of saying any one of us could be hit by a bus tomorrow.  A good reminder to plan for the future but live in the moment and not to leave too much for tomorrow.Best of luck with you and your cousins fight with this terrible disease.

4954873,0,t3_3iqrh9,Use a pair of clippers to get it close then I use a generic Gillette knockoff razor from Sams. I shave my head in the shower start by washing with normal body wash or bar soap which i prefer. After its clean get some cream and lather that shit. Now grab the razor and starting from the middle of  your forehead start shaving over your head. Just go straight back up and over. To give you a midline. Pick a side you want to shave first and start moving the razor closer to that side when you start your next pass. I use my off hand to align the razor with the midline of my last pass. Do this for both sides. For the back of your head and neck i like to go up along my spine and then to the sides same procedure as for the top align the razor and take each half at a time. Be careful around the ears i usually add more cream and shave toward the ear cut myself too many times trying to start at the ear and go away. Check the ears when youre done and out of the shower. Its easy to miss some hair by the junction with the side burns.Once you think you are done wash off the cream and wash your head again with some kind of mild soap. Bar soap works well here... I use dial. If you use aftershave go for it. Im a cheap grad student and i just put some isopropyl alcohol on my palms and slick my skull with that. Dont cry let it evaporate and then put some moisturizer on your nice and smooth head.Final step feel badass.,cancer,cuj3ogf,3,t5_2qixx

You know him and youre in your situation on a constant basis so I couldnt do it justice.Perhaps start asking him how hes feeling. I lost dad  years ago when I was  so I was a lot more unabashed in what I said but I would actually ask him of his condition quite often and hed just calmly tell me the truth every time. The difference was the doctors never told us we had run out of options until the day before he died so we never had that scenario of having to tell him but thinking back Im sure he knew in his last two weeks. He implicitly told me goodbye I felt when he said do what your mom says okay  something hed never usually say and like your dad his breathing was quite bad at that point....last thing which I sort of felt I shouldnt say but here goes. In his last hours if you can see hes in a lot of pain or distress just know that he may not be fully there. In the case of my dad and other patients Ive heard of they start talking symbolic language in their last moments and generally theyre not aware. Ive had some trouble dealing with not the fact that my dad died but the sight of seeing him die because I didnt think it was peaceful but someone told me my dad had not been completely conscious and it makes me feel better to think that way about it.,cancer,cxy6aoe,1,t5_2qixx

The cornerstone of treatment for cancer related pain is medications like he is getting. It sounds like they did tests to make sure there was nothing more urgent or anything that needed surgery.  I have worked at the Cross.  They are probably open for emergencies. These include people that are becoming paralyzed cant breathe or are having massive bleeding because of their cancer. Thankfully that is not him. Radiation is an effective treatment for pain but it can take weeks to take effect so starting now vs tomorrow is not essential  the cornerstone of management is medications like he is getting.  Anyway he may not be in any shape today to lie still on the table for the time required.  He doesnt need the Cross this weekend again I dont know his case but making some guesses here. What he needs is pain and symptom management.  Luckily Edmonton is legitimately world renowned for their palliative carepain teams and I hope and expect he is in the right place.Best wishes to your family and I hope he can feel better soon. ,cancer,cyedppf,2,t5_2qixx

Stage III usually implied that the tumor involves either the celiac artery or SMA and is not resectable. If your father had a Whipple Procedure he likely had Stage II pancreatic cancer.  Your father has exocrine pancreatic cancer. Endocrine pancreatic cancer PNET is not treated with chemotherapy or radiation after resection.  The survival rates for resected pancreatic cancers are not great... and depend on a few factors that you have not shared      Lymph node involvement Were there any positive nodes      Margins Was there a close ltmm or positive marginI would guess that your father is receiving Gemcitabine as per the CONKO clinical trial that established months of Gemcitabine as the standard of care.  If you want to see the data for survival following Whipple CONKO remains the very best data out there as to what percentage of people have recurrence and are dead within  and years of completing treatment. Whether to include radiation remains controversial as there are conflicting data. If your father were in Europe he almost certainly would get no radiation at all. Whether radiation is included in this country depends on his doctor and the margin status and nodal status of the tumor.,cancer,czayd8n,2,t5_2qixx

She was my best friend for over  years and as difficult as it was I try to do what I know she wanted me to do...to live to be happy and move on even though it hurts like hell. She started to decline about  days before she died and got put on hospice. During the  days on hospice I got some closure by being with her talking to her and holding her hand so she wasnt afraid. Four days before she passed I knew the time was short and I said my goodbye to her. The last words she said aloud to me give me comfort everyday she said I love you. The next day she was nearly comatose and she could no longer speak aloud. Monday October  at  am my family called to tell me she had just passed away in her husbands arms. I celebrate her life everyday by living my life the best I am able to by showing and telling my family that I love them by being good to myself and allowing myself to grieve in my own time. Its all she ever wanted for all of us to be happy. She even came to her husband in a dream and told him to knock off the desperation he was feeling the Friday before he had called the National Suicide Prevention Hotline because he was so lost and drunk hes doing much better now. I cant say I find joy yet because Im still pretty raw but Im able to function now and I havent really these last few months.

If you have cancer then sure it is worth the risk. But if you dont have cancer and you have a noninvasive alternative the risk of permanent damage seems not worth it. To me.My friend with the BRCA gene had a mastectomy and hysterectomy in her mid s after having her kids. I think that is a very different decision to doing it now so early.

He did great with the Magrath regimen and his post chemo pet was clear.  But since he had a residual abdominal mass not active on PET he had it removed and while most was scar tissue the pathologist found a few ghost cells.  So he is now considered to be refractory.  He completed  round of RICE and did fantasticsecond round is in a few days.  The oncologist wants to do an allow transplant in Decembermy husbands sister is a halfmatch.

I guess if I could add my c specific to my situation I was always really happy to hear about my friends lives and stay up to date with the amazing and positive things happening with them.  I couldnt really live my life through the treatment as I had a very intense regime so my day to day life throughout the treatment was bleak and any distraction was good.  I think your friend would be happy to hear about your plans.  I think the things that bothered me a little were when friends complained about how tough everything was at the moment and how much they needed a holiday when the tough stuff was moving house  literally nothing more than that  I felt that lacked a little selfawareness probably.

Listen to the medical staff and be wary of the neighbors cousins wacko advice. We each walk our own path depending on our treatments and even more on our strength. Media portrayals of chemo IMO tend to focus on the horrible or the glamorous after makeup and good camera work of course. As others have stated YMMV. Some of the people in my circle didnt even know until it was over and found it hard to believe that Id been through chemo.I was  at the time and had led a semisedentary lifestyle. But I was part of a trial where we were active every day and I believe thats what helped me. Yes my hair was gone about a month after starting yes my appetite fluctuated but I ate every day just eliminated spicy chili and pizza greasy stuff red sauces due to mouth sores. I only had to take one antinausea pill and that was a preemptive strike advised by my nurse. If nausea becomes a problem Ensure is your friend. Itll probably be in the fridge at your oncology office. I mostly drove to and from appointments myself but had family and friends drive me when the steroids decreased my driving confidence in heavy traffic Tip get appointments scheduled to avoid rush hour traffic. I had enough sick days so I took the rest of the year off. Id been working every day for  years and going to the doctor a couple times a year. My new job was to go to the doctor every week or every other week. That was . years ago Ive since retired age  now And my part time job is still going to the doctor every six months or so plus annual mammogram.

This isnt directed towards OP but my wife and I sort of feel this too even though I dont know if its how people actually feel or if they really would say it We so far have most of my insane costs covered through insurance but were not rich by any means and its almost like were not allowed to have nice things or spend money on ourselves or at least it feels that way. People have NO FUCKING IDEA how much anguish time money and suffering is involved in a serious cancer diagnosis. Both of our lives will never be the same. And yeah there is so much people dont even think of in terms of EXTRA costs even beyond the hundreds of thousands in medical bills. The bill that came in the mail today for one dosage of a specific drug thankfully covered by the insurance were on through my wifes work is  thousand dollars list rate and Im only on something like dose  of . Sure the people OP is talking about probably should be careful with finances if they are actually going through this with their child but at the same time they deserve to spend some of the donated money on things to improve their quality of living. It kind of reminds me of how some douches on Fox News a few years ago were saying people in poverty werent poor because they had modern appliances like fridges and microwaves. Im lucky and live maybe  minutes or so to the Cleveland Clinic where Ive gotten all my treatment but that is gas money too then car costs then  dollars parking every time. The crazy thing people who havent experienced this dont understand.... is that k is peanuts in terms of treatment costs especially if you have no insurance. Ive been thinking of actually putting a pic of me at my worst on my phone so that I can remind myself why I need to live life to the fullest and also so that I can show people not in a malicious way what Ive actually been going through if it ever came up to somebody I havent seen in years.This isnt meant to be a witch hunt turned around on OP there HAVE been cases where people fake cancer for profit and its disgusting but I think our emotions are coming out how hard it actually can be for cancer patients and families and that there are lifelong ramifications even when people on the outside are thinking everything should magically be all better!,cancer,ddq3ftq,6,t5_2qixx

Is it to boost blood counts and revitalize the marrow is it supposed to kill cancer or what?Brentuximab is in clinical trials to become part of frontline treatment for Hodgkins. I forgot it was part of the NCCN guidelines for secondline treatment. Still I hope it goes well. Im probably going to have to do Brentuximab in the notsodistant future.,cancer,dfg3mfj,1,t5_2qixx

Ill try your suggestions as well.I found one other thing that may be helping Ive been using a chemical exfoliant every day and I think its drying out my skin in a good way.  It could also just be that Im far enough along since my infusion that my skin is healing up well see.Also I profilestalked you and I was very excited to see where you are in treatment right now since my cancer has also metastasized to at least one lymph node near my aorta as well.  Its still pretty small but its possible theyve detected others as well  Im waiting on my next scan to see if theres an update.  Best of luck to you!,cancer,dfi0xoe,1,t5_2qixx

I think an LDH of  is in the normal range.  I know you are feeling discouraged and are probably scared shitless.  But the good news is that you are chemo sensitive! It sucks that you need more treatment but there is always hope as long as you are responding.  I know this is easier said than done but PLEASE STOP GOOGLING YOUR CANCER!  My husband was diagnosed with Burkitts lymphoma last year and I cant tell you how many sleepless nights Ive had because I read something online.  Ive learned that everyones cancer is differentif your onc says that the odds are in your favor  then hang onto that.  Dont torture yourself by reading articles that may not be relevant to your situation.  Sending you good thoughts.  Please feel free to PM me if you need someone to talk to.,cancer,dfog4aj,5,t5_2qixx

11430118,0,t3_634cdu,Im late to the party but I was diagnosed and treated for Medullary Thyroid Cancer last August. I broke it to my mom and brother with as much positivity as possible because of a similar situation my dad had died less than a year prior. I have them the angle that Thyroid Cancer is one of the most treatable types and my doctors were extremely optimistic that they could treat it quickly and efficiently. I outlined what I would be looking at as far as treatment went and that I was optimistic as well.People look at cancer and consider it a death sentence but people get it every day and survive! You will too! Emphasize that fact and encourage your mom to see it from that perspective! I kept a smile on the whole conversation because your positivity not only helps those you love to cope it has been proven to help you through treatment as well.Wishing you all the best and feel free to message me if you ever have any questions!,cancer,dfrlbb2,7,t5_2qixx

11549212,0,t1_dg533o9,In our situation community setting in your terms we had to get the slides from the lab and that took a lawyer.I dont know if the ObGyn could not or would not request them. My impression was that the lab would not give them up without pressure but I watched from the sidelines so who knows.I know that the lawyer got it done. No one else even mentioned that we could have a review that it was even possible. We never thought to ask until we were asking the lawyer questions about other problems and he brought it up.,cancer,dg53tu0,1,t5_2qixx
11593305,0,t1_dg9vc6g,Good luck going back! It took me a month or so to get back in the swing of things after my year off also IThigh tech. I have set expectations that sometimes Im just going to have to go home and sometimes Im going to need to work from home and they just have to deal with it. Im on an oral chemo now so sometimes I dont have an immune system and sometimes Ive just plum run out of energy. Im generally a very efficient high performer so Im getting away with it for now.  My main problem is that Ive become so conscious of my time and there are some meetings where I just want to flip the table and say Dont you realize how short our lives are??!!?? but so far Ive managed to hold it together. But for sure I dont have the patience for bullshit I used to. ,cancer,dga3y4r,3,t5_2qixx
11617885,0,t1_dgctz44,Glad these convos are evening you out a bit with communication. I get what youre saying but the people in government in your area trying to charge you money for a marriage license fee and all the other negative impacts their involvement would have shouldnt impact your love life  because as you probably know better than most people you never know how long you have healthy or functional as a human being so life should be lived to the fullest in the best way you can live it. If we were in Saudi Arabia or born there I could say the same  the government has done so much good for our country and for us etc they give us housing and roads and cars and electricity and opportunities .. does that mean wed go along with public lashings and executions and stoning women to death for reporting being raped because well just because I dont agree with  thing doesnt mean I should be a bad citizen... just because I disagree with some things doesnt mean I get to go against the grain and not participate in stoning women to death.. Governments are just people people are sometimes wrong or crazy and shouldnt govern your love life if you want to get married without being bothered with being harmed further by crazy people who happen to make money by being government officials. In your case this marriage thing is a religious affair and part of the practice of your faith. Your freedom of religion is being impacted here really so when you come down to it your freedom to exercise your right to freedom of religion in this case centered around marriage is being held up by state laws which goes against the constitution so if you wanted to maybe you could bring a legal suit against them for it  but you could just avoid it entirely and have a priest officiate a marriage so you are married within your religion.  I just dont see why the two have to be so connected lovereligious marriage and the legal version of marriage where your assets are joined.Life is hard enough as it is.. Its not even like youre lying youd just be having a private religious ritualceremony without paying the local government for the privilege of having them recognize or officially stamp your marriage  the priest would make it official rather than a government agent which isnt necessary anyway in the eyes of god as far as I know. No lying necessary just not participating or opting out of something that makes no sense and only causes harm that other humans want to impose because they are greedy and dont care about the hardships they cause others.society is all about beneficial social order this particular thing isnt in any way going to harm the beneficial social order or your place in it its a religious belief and ritual and paying the state for the privilege to practice your beliefs should be illegal to begin with based on the very foundation of laws in our society  but some greedy official somewhere down the line decided to interfere and no one has righted it yet!just saying..... get married if you want to get married. forget the paperwork. legal marriage and religious marriage are separate things. When Catholicism was set up it wasnt set up to pay the government for the right to be married. Marriage is still marriage even if you dont ask a government agent for permission.,cancer,dgcwbrc,1,t5_2qixx

11805616,0,t3_68b8k2,NHL itself is such a heterogeneous mixture of diseases that it is difficult to make generalizing statements regarding its etiology.That said most NHLs actually present in older people gt so early onset is not really a defining characteristic of the disease.  Moreover family history of lymphoma in general is not highly predictive of risk indicating a major environmental component.  Exposures to certain viral infections e.g. EpsteinBarr and chemicals e.g. herbicides have been linked to increased risk of NHL subtypes.  The latter is also consistent with many occupationalrisk patterns including farming and textilerelated jobs.Many NHLs are characterized genetically by genefusions which has helped narrow down potential biological processes e.g. AIDmediated recombination although linking these to specific exposures is still a focus of much research.,cancer,dgy7h4c,1,t5_2qixx
