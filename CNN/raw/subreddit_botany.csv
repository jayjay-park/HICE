489233,0,t3_1zo8t4,I dont know about the field as a whole but I can tell you about my experience with plant pathology. For me it is a combination of two of my favorite things growing plants and bacteria. The sad thing is I was seeing how many plants I could kill basically. I was playing around with different antibiotic resistances and seeing how that changed the pathogens resistance to camalexin in A. thaliana. I would do the resistance assays then infect the plants and see how they did. It was very very cool but showed me that research is not what I want to do with my life. Ive always wanted to go into science education but I wanted to make sure I didnt want to do research you know? If I had to though I would likely choose plant pathology to go into but I dont know what kind of things you can do with that unless you get some connection in ag or you get a doctorate and go into academiaresearch.,botany,cfvvnzm,2,t5_2qrcz

There are trees you can fit people inside in redwood stands with large trees.If you didnt hit the cambium as long as the tree was getting adequate transfer of waternutrients through the xylem and there was enough structural support it could probably live for a good while. The one caveat is that the tree wouldnt be scarring over naturally over time which means that the area youre exposing would be fairly susceptible to parasitesfungiinsects.

The white oak subfamily has a tendency to hybridize at the drop of a hat. These include the live oaks in Texas. White oaks also will reproduce via suckers rather than starting with an acorn. A sucker from one tree will be a clone of the original. They also tend not to separate at the root. So watering one tree or poisoning one tree may kill an entire block of trees as they may all be connected to each other and may all be a single individual both as a clone and through shared root systems.,botany,cpyhulk,0,t5_2qrcz
