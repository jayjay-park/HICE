264459,0,t3_1x51fv,I initially assumed yes but now when I went back over the Kickstarter page and I see they have a new tier Viscount which specifically says Alpha and Beta...So Id say that Baron is just Alpha access.Nope Baron gets Alpha and Beta.,kingdomcome,cf865oj,3,t5_2zi6m

365396,0,t3_1y9xhs,Well I havent heard a word about fasttravel so keep in mind that you may run around a lot and therefore theyve sized it down. But I do agree with you the larger map the better but yet again youll have to agree that quality is more important than quantity. Also keep in mind this is a fairly small studio working on something new and theyve got loads of things to work on. Im guessing act  and  will have larger maps.And its honestly really hard to comment on map size without having seen and played it.,kingdomcome,cfimzx1,3,t5_2zi6m
372486,0,t3_1y9tn9,Im one of the guys that just got on board here.  Heard about this game from it showing up on the front of the Star Citizen website fully endorsed by Chris Roberts.  That got me to watch the Kickstarter video pitch and sure enough after that I backed it   I suspect theres a nice chunk of new backers coming from the Star Citizen community.  I know the settings are nothing alike but there seems to be a lot of people myself included that like what both these games are wanting to accomplish.Great time to be into gaming.,kingdomcome,cfjdgcv,2,t5_2zi6m

3356772,0,t1_cpatylo,gtGet it through your thick skull I never said it contradicts anything.gthe supports the assumption underpinning trickledown economics that leads to this kind of policy namely that supply of goods and services is what drives the economy and demand is meaningless.You are saying that because he thinks its him who actually employs people and not some abstract demand that he thinks that demand is meaningless  argumentum a contrario which is LIE. He never said that.gthe absolutely stated what drives the economy in his mind it is the supplyNo he didnt he didnt say a single fucking word about what drives economy. You are making more shit up in every new post. You are making conlusions about his macro economic opinions just based on your assumptions. ,kingdomcome,cpawaj8,3,t5_2zi6m
