Its green when your mic is onstreaming in a room.What youre talking is possible today by clicking on the Camera icon and then going into Capture Mode. You can then stream that to Twitch or just show it on a monitor so people outside the headset can see what youre doing. The problem is that has to be on a separate computer screen otherwise you will see yourself. Its the challenge of showing the desktop screen in VR ,bigscreen,d97tkgi,1,t5_3ebs2

11099225,0,t3_5yh4wr,the black out problem is due to the way Oculus shuts down VR apps when you open another VR app. Oculus changed this in their runtime in September   you used to be able to just alttab between Bigscreen and other VR apps!BUT I HAVE GOOD NEWSIn a month or so in the upcoming Oculus . update Bigscreen will resume rendering no more black screen when you close another VR app and come back to Bigscreen!,bigscreen,deq35vq,3,t5_3ebs2
