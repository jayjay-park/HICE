3110982,0,t3_2vf50w,So  I looked through your post history just to confirm that you are a servicemember stationed in Italy.  Thank you for your service!Now  just as a warning  there are a couple of things you may want to consider before entering into this enterprise.As an American living in Italy you are governed by the Status of Forces Agreement SOFA  This is an agreement between Italy and America on what laws apply to you while you live there among other things.Now  as an American living in Italy you are afforded many great opportunities and benefits.  One of those benefits is that you can purchase items on the local economy tax free.  That benefit comes with a pretty big caveat  it is supposed to be for your personal use or as a gift.  Not as a moneymaking enterprise.Secondly  your ability to ship back to the States is another benefit as a servicemember living abroad because you can utilize the US Post Office that is located on your base.  Between the customs declaration which you would be lying if you were to declare these items as gifts when you ship them back to someone else for a profit  a federal offence you would also be skirting the rule on use of the postal services on base as a home business.  They the postal people who work on base actually watch how much and to who you ship things to  to see if there is a pattern of home business like activity being run through your APOPSC mailbox.I am telling you this because I care and I dont want to see you servicemember soliciting random people on reddit getting in trouble.  It aint worth it.In fact  if you watch American Forces Network television at all they have spots commercials all the time warning you about doing things like this.If you have ANY questions about anything I have posted here you can follow up with your local JAG.  I am pretty sure they will confirm it.Source I was an American working in a capacity similar to yours living in Italy for  years not too long ago.,malelifestyle,cokgae4,3,t5_2sk0u

You actually NEED to be this wealthy to live out of a Westy at  these days. Romanticizing the idea of permanent van camping has made it unreachable for average people. When I was in high school my friends and I had Westfalia vans and spent every weekend camped out and every summer driving from statetostate on a new adventure. A high schoolcollege aged kid couldnt touch a Westfalia with both his parents ks combined these days and its because everyone seems to think it is so damn cool. Its great that this guy is representing the Westy  and all but we really dont need the extra attention.EDIT In case you dont know what Im talking about GoWesty  is one of the companies that has drastically affected the price of old Volkswagen campers. Sportsmobile is another van company that buys up every van they can get their hands on for retrofitting. These are the big names in the game. I seem to have hurt some feelings by expressing my opinion here so I apologize to the  people who disagree with me for having a different opinion than you.

8121934,0,t3_4qhav1,A lot of us have been there I stayed a virgin till I was . Struggles with selfesteem issues most of my life approaching  now my biggest advice for shitty feelings is force yourself to do stuff you like. Being busy doesnt allow you to be alone with your depressive thoughts learn shit online or go out and take a hike on your own. For meeting people start small like getting a job where there are a lot of people your age. When I started my first retail job I forced myself to talk to customers outside of Need help with anything you would be surprised at how many people like to talk about their day to a complete stranger. Also people like hanging out with people who do stuff so the few acquaintances you have find random events in your city and tell them if they want to go. Obviously its not going to be easy but you have to be comfortable being alone. I dont have a lot of friends but I learned to be happy being alone but can still hang out with people when I want to by inviting them to an event. ,malelifestyle,d4sz89q,1,t5_2sk0u

9212452,0,t1_d8jn7po,There are TONS of resources a Google search away to support this but Ill explain the logic. When you are not warmed up stretching a muscle is basically tearing it in all the wrong ways. It will be weaker and more prone to injury as a result. Dynamic stretches are about warming up the muscle and using it with opposing muscles to stretch it. For instance warming up biceps and triceps and then doing what amounts to an unweighted tricep pump that stretches your bicep or an unweighted bicep curl that stretches your tricep.A static stretch merely stretches the muscle with nothing to control it but how much those muscles are willing to break.Static stretches are really only good for postworkout. Working out a muscle involves contracting the muscle over and over. Static should be done in a way that is not forcing it but rather allowing it to lengthen.,malelifestyle,d8jqw2a,1,t5_2sk0u

11257236,0,t3_60nva3,Not bad tips. I feel like you couldve elaborated a little more on the first one. The reason why most people dont focus on someones name is because they are thinking of something to say or how they look. Theyre trying to make a good first impression and let the name slip while they focus on that.Which is why I find tip number two so helpful. I dont normally visualise someone but instead just think of someone else who has that name. Often more difficult than you think. I suck at names remember!  But if you can do it in those first few minutes of meeting someone then you are more likely to remember and you can take your mind off it and back into the conversation as you have that link back in again.Finally writing the name down seems like a bit of a silly idea but actually I can easily see that helping so much. Not only because in the act of writing it down and reading it again youll be going over the memory of their name but also because some names are just completely new and it helps to have that push.,malelifestyle,df7zodv,2,t5_2sk0u
