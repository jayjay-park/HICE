4187993,0,t3_38skxa,Hi!  My MFP user name is babybirdies as well MFP friends welcome!  I am    SW  CW . and Ive been working on this currently for a little over  months.  My goal weight is a bit fluid my doctor suggests  but I think I am aiming more for within the normal BMI range for my height.  It feels great to lose weight and get closer to my goals but I am lookig to do this is a sustainable way so Im not asking for super fast weight loss rather looking to develop eating habits I can be happy and healthy with for the rest of my life.While my start weight in this attempt to lose weight was  at one point I think I weighed as much as .  I lost enough weight more than  years ago to beat the high blood pressure I had then and discovered that I cant sustain a keto diet in the long term but I can rock at calorie tracking and using moderation and portion control.  I have  daughters age  and  and an awesomely supportive husband who was my high school sweetheart and is my best friend.  My health is good now aside from having gallbladder cholecystitis but it is well managed with diet.  I am working on fueling my body instead of eating my feelings and being active in order to keep my health good!Its really fun and encouraging to be in touch with a group of like minded people working on bettering themselves.  Good luck to everyone!  ,magentamanatees,crxmroo,11,t5_38is3
4247253,0,t3_38wl9i,When Im tired I force myself to go on a walk. It sounds counterintuitive but light exercise will reenergize you. My low energy days are also related to my migraine condition and it can mess with my sleep during certain times of the month so sometimes I just have to give in and let my body rest and relax when I can. But again a walk will usually help. Staying hydrated and getting good sleep is great for energy too.,magentamanatees,cs4dlla,2,t5_38is3

Soup...I make a couple of pots a week so there is always something quick and healthy in the fridge if my daughter wont let me make dinner as planned. ,magentamanatees,cs6qly4,1,t5_38is3
4317792,0,t1_csc0jq8,I know how much it sucks believe it but you just have to keep telling yourself youre not a medical mystery. Studies will not be done about you. You are a normal average human that will lose weight because she is eating at a deficit.Truthfully you really might NOT lose before or during your period. Take it in accept it. Stay on the course YOU ARE NOT A MEDICAL MYSTERY. Youre going to lose weight. Patience will yield amazing results. I promise! Ive had  week periods where the scale didnt move at all and I was completely frustrated but you just have to believe in yourself calorie counting and try to look ahead.Also youd probably love to read this ,magentamanatees,cscccyg,2,t5_38is3

4508598,0,t1_csyxk5e,Youre so right slip ups happen but I need to make sure to get back to it and not let it take over like every other time Ive tried to lose weight.  Looking forward is definitely better than dwelling on past mistakes. ,magentamanatees,csyyhyz,2,t5_38is3
4601444,0,t3_3e07p9,Ive been eating a lot of chilled soups lately because its too hot to cook! Like this Cold Cucumber Soup with Yogurt and Dill  which tastes great with half the olive oil. I have a big bowl of this Summer Borscht recipe chilling out in my fridge made with  greek yogurt instead of sour cream. Both are delicious! The dill is magic in both of these dont skip it. ,magentamanatees,ctalmql,2,t5_38is3
