Clicked clicked buy selected size selected wrong size new I didnt have a chance at getting them so just clicked buy anyway..waiting in line. Then got my other computer and selected my correct size..waiting in line. Had my computer and my phone in front of me watching pooping swearing sweating shaking. Size . is in my cart not my size still so fucking excited. Sending the email confirmation to my few sneakerhead friends who didnt even know the release happened. Waited about  minutes more to find out my size had sold out which I was very sad about but only sad for a second because I finally had them. I finally had the shoes I had waited so long for. After the Footlocker tweet in December I had lost all hope. Now Im going to sell them as theyre still not my size and theyre not what I was expecting.

460259,0,t3_1zczo4,In South Dakota specifically my school SDSU I rarely see anyone with nice sneakers. Most people wear cowboy or work boots department store Nikes and Asics and a lot of skate shoes these people are the ones stuck in th grade. The majority of people withnice sneakers are people wearing Team Jordans and occasional Spizikes or Son Of Mars and Ill see a pair of Air Force s KDs and Lebrons every once in a while. I have seen maybe  people in the last four years wearing retro Jordans around. I dont think I have ever seen anyone wearing some of the better New Balance Asics or even Air Maxes just a lot of grandpa shoes and running shoes. Whenever I wear my retros or KDs or dunks sometimes people will compliment or comment on them but dont really know about them other than that they look nice. I dont really know anyone else here that is big into sneakers which is probably why I spend so much time on this subreddit so I have someone to talk to about shoes. I cant speak for the rest of the state but in my little slice of South Dakota sneaker culture is pretty nonexistent maybe in the high schools and the one big city around here it is more prevalent but at my college I havent noticed much at all. ,Sneakers,cfskxto,3,t5_2qrtt

Check out    Yes there are def a lot of overpriced listings sitting on eBay but the data says that because the best deals disappear quickly actual price of shoes that sell is lower than the perception that people have of eBay.  This is maybe our single most important finding since we started this work.  ,Sneakers,cgclyrp,5,t5_2qrtt

I usually wait at least  hours before scrubbing off. This stuff is great...it doesnt fuck with the glue or the paint and it comes off very easily. However be careful not to get this shit inon anything but the sink or shoes...little droplets that spray off when cleaning or you randomly touching something will leave a white smear that wont show up until it dries potentially hours. Its easy to get off and doesnt harm anything but can be a pain in the ass if you arent careful. Other than that this stuff is the truth and its crazy cheap!,Sneakers,ch0r07j,1,t5_2qrtt

1026713,0,t1_chkzjrj,white has some nice contrast. quality is pretty good. i dont know how familiar you are with GLVs but theyre inbetween a general release and ronnie quality. mostly because of the materials picked though. i personally wish they went with a mesh on the toe and across the medial and laterial like the volcanoes and mints have. the nylon on these is very light and comfortable but i feel the mesh gives a more qualitative feel though. but these are a light and springy shoe so i get it. the suede toe is pretty thin but its great quality. very soft. the leather on the back is on par with RF and a really great color you need to see in person. but overall the execution is great. you get  laces yellow the midnight blue and cream which i chose. yellow looks bad. the proportion of yellow to the other colors is so small that yellow laces look out of place. navymidnight blue looks great. i just wrote a review. sweet. ,Sneakers,chkzrxf,5,t5_2qrtt

How many animal hides will be needed to produce hundreds of thousands of pairs? But I really couldnt see Jordan Brand making this move without being certain that the new suppliers could provide enough quality materials to keep their manufacturing numbers steady  at a minimum. If the rep is being completely honest and I think he is we may have already had a glimpse at the new quality in high quantities. The leather on last Novembers Laney Jordan  and this years Infrared  Jordan  was a significant improvement from the glossy synthetic leathers we saw on other colorways within the last couple of years.

Modern brogues trace their roots to a rudimentary shoe originating in Scotland and Ireland that was constructed using untanned hide with perforations allowing water to drain when crossing wet terrain such as a bog   Brogues were traditionally considered to be outdoor or country footwear not otherwise appropriate for casual or business occasions but brogues are now considered appropriate in most contexts.  Brogues are most commonly found in one of four toe cap styles full or wingtip semi quarter and longwing and four closure styles Oxford Derby ghillie and monk Today in addition to their typical form of sturdy leather shoes or boots brogues may also take the form of business dress shoes sneakers highheeled womens shoes or any other shoe form that utilises or evokes the multipiece construction and perforated serrated piece edges characteristic of brogues.gtgtImage i  Mens full brogue Oxford dress shoesInteresting Oxford shoe | Dress shoe | Monk shoe Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcjouhj oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeletecjouhj.

Should I feel guilty?  youre saying the authenticity of someones purchase is based upon seeing them play LIVE. You know how how many sports Fans are in love with players from their team theyve never seen? I go to Citi Field a couple times a year and see pre teens and teens in jerseys of the some of the  Mets Seaver Mays.  Shit Ive got a Butkus jersey. Never seen the man play a down live. does this analogy only apply to sneakers? Because if it does its more sneakerhead elitist bullshit.

Some info on these  handmade in Japan suede outer and full leather lining and insole cap toe is leather also. Stitched peace tab is leather as well eyelets are brass and laces are cotton as expected. Unsure if theres any special dyeing to the laces since Visvim does that a lot. From what Ive read about Skagways theyre goodyear welted on the sole and then the rubber outer sole is applied over that. Gives them some height I rise up about an inch more in these. These should last a suuuuuuper long time.  First pair of Visvims and Im super please will probably try and pick up a more versatile pair next time haha,Sneakers,cj8pnz7,1,t5_2qrtt

1598835,0,t1_cjgd9d2,gt I think if you buy FAKE shoes grey market unauthorized whatever then you are whack as fuck and you dont appreciate the sneaker game enough to buy the real thing. Rape resale prices are apart of the game buy real shoes. I will see someone with fake Jordans they are unbelievably noticeable by the way and instantly think theyre poor  new  lame for wearing fakes. Its just as bad as buying fake Louis or Gucci.I know this is an unpopular opinion thread so I maybe shouldnt argue. BUT I think this is just a childish way to view it. I mean hey if you want to spend  on a pair of  Breds that arent really that great of a shoe in terms of quality go ahead. Maybe in your financial position thats nothing to you but it isnt for everyone But if you ask me its just a plain smarter decision to get the unauthorized version and save . Granted if the shoe isnt rape in resale Ill just buy the authorized version. Like I do with  of my shoes.And you must see replicas which arent the same as unauthorized if theyre unbelievably noticeable. Because with the exception of some small details s s s etc look exactly the same as the authorized counterparts. For me I earn my money. And at the end of the day when I sit down and decide what I want to spend that money on I would rather get a shoe for  than spend  on the authorized version. If you want to hate me for that and call me lame as fuck tell me how Im poor or dont appreciate sneakers go ahead. But you sound like a child when doing it. ,Sneakers,cjgpadh,1,t5_2qrtt

1923167,0,t3_2go0th,About  years ago I loved buying sneakers. The individualism it brought the creativity that went into them and the diversity they brought to each outfit. I think initially it was simply pop culture that brought me in. Youd see music videos and what other people were wearing and I dug the style. Where I lived in Canada we were limited on where we could go to purchase the type of sneaker I wanted. At the time Foot Lockers Champs etc. were really the only outlets and they still mainly focused on sports rather then lifestyle and fashion back then. Growing my collection was reserved for vacations packages from family etc. which almost made the search more exciting. Back then the online presence for sneakers including marketplaces online shopping stores blogs forums etc. was nonexistent compared to todays landscape  or maybe I just wasnt looking in the right places. Nevertheless I had amassed a respectable collection despite......then I grew up and out of it. Sold most on ebay and gave all my beaters away. Then earlier this year something drew me back. My excitement for the culture multiplied tenfold compared to when I did it as a kid. I couldnt stop educating myself again. The landscape has changed whereas now I CAN get the latest styles available at my finger tips via the internet. I thought being nearly  years old now like I am my style would have changed and evolved but I realize more and more the same things that attracted me to sneakers is still there. Its a bind to my teenage years and the good ol days perhaps. When I put on Stan Smiths I can hear the music that was playing when I rock my Jordan s I remember hitting up BBQs when I have on Air Maxs I remember who I was rolling with at the time and so on. The nostalgia comes rushing back. And thanks to resources like this subreddit Sole Collector etc. my eyes have been opened to styles and shoes that I wouldnt normally have rocked back in the day. Fortunately for me being a grown man has allowed me certain privileges I didnt have as a teenager namely a great job with a great salary. Good or back  call it what you may  but I cant stop spending my money on sneakers now. Since getting back into the game earlier this year its been an obsession one that Ive totally succumbed to. ,Sneakers,ckkxf4o,7,t5_2qrtt

Shoes not being TTS doesnt happen nearly as much as people think. Honestly I would say just get your normal size in every shoe and exchange if needed. When a shoe isnt TTS you will see people saying it everywhere like with the Jordan sI would just recommend keeping in mind that Penny s arent very comfortable IMO. Its hard to explain but the front of the shoe and that back of the shoe fit like  completely different shoes. More Info,Sneakers,cmpklcv,2,t5_2qrtt

2608440,0,t1_cmz1lx9,gtWell the designs have stood up.. Its nostalgia. They are still selling us on things we had or wanted in the past. In  no kid or teenager is gonna care about some shoes that a old ass basketball player wore in the s. They are limiting supply to create future sales not even realizing that they dont have a limited window. gtThink about how many retro shoes still havent released.Not many OGs. Off the top of my head I can say some old Jordan  colorways the Maroon s and the low s and s. Thats really about it. Actually some OG colorways are on their rd or th release Including OG the BlackInfared s have released FIVE times in different variations.gtI honestly think Nike should put a different shoe up on Nike ID every year and rotate them around. This would keep the model in peoples minds and allow people to make their own CWs without resorting to fakes. They could start with unpopular models like the XV and work their way from there.Nah cause they would just fuck up the options. I HATE Spikes but the SpikeID is just flat out embarrassing.

2636816,0,t3_2q3npj,Levis  Slim Straight jeans are extremely comfortable right off the shelf and if you buy the correct length they wont bunch up on top of your shoe. I often wear them with a single cuff with my Dunk Highs and they look great. Like you Im not a big fan of pin rolling but these look good both over the top of the shoe and cuffed high enough to sit above. Gap sells a really nice slim fit Japanese selvedge denim that takes awhile to break in but feels great once theyve been worn for awhile. The finish is very nice with contrasting seams that look great when cuffed. Since the denim is a little on the stiff side they make really nice tight crisp cuffs. They also make a skinny pair in the same material that look great but dont fit my frame as comfortably. Im sure there are many other options but these are some affordable choices you might be able to go to any mall and try on for yourself. ,Sneakers,cn2rjp1,3,t5_2qrtt

3177086,0,t3_2wi50o,I would venture a guess hereDeadstock originally referred to exactly what you described and came into parlance when the first sneakerheadshardcore collectors emerged.  Youd have these little mom and pop shops with either old shit sitting in the cellar for years or merchants often immigrants with overseas connects who were importing dead stock from foreign sources because those products were back in demand in places like NYC.  The documentary Just for Kicks speaks to this a little bit.Collectors were seeking this dead stock because especially in the former case you could find heat andor cult classics well below retail.So my guess is somewhere along the way a kid who didnt know the precise meaning of deadstock assumed from context it just meant unwornmint.

Edit I get why you cant add to cart. Its in store only but try it. Select  and then right underneath the size selector youll see available in LA. LA is in blue. Its right below the style ID year and colorway which is right below the size selector . I believe that means LA store only. All other sizes say NY. Click on CONDITIONAL PAIRS.

3592260,0,t1_cq1qic1,I was about  years old when Michael was Rookie of the year back then and so my memory is kinda wonky but I still used to watch the games with my brother who was  at the time.He never got as interested in shoes as I got but I remember he used to have the metallic purple Jordan s which my mom didnt want to get him at first because she said they looked like someone wrapped them in tinfoil that was some crazy stuff for the time I wonder what she wouldve said if she know about the Night Track.It makes sense to call them that because thats what they were  the shoes Michael Jordan wore. The greatest of all time before Mike came around was considered to be Kareem AbdulJabbar and people had no idea what was to become of Michael he could have easily become a flash in the pan. The greatest of all time thing began to stick around about  after guys like Larry Bird Magic and Kareem himself gave him a lot of props and it then manifested with his first title which he couldnt have done without Scottie btw. ,Sneakers,cq1qtv3,7,t5_2qrtt

Wooden is ideal. It will get wet. Take a dry handtowel and place it over the shoe where the crease is. Set an iron on mediumlow to medium heat but with medium or high steam. Run the iron lightly over the towel until the crease starts to even out.Honestly though itll do some but not a lot. Creasing is a part of shoes.

4009180,0,t1_crd3pwt,I would say the ventilation isnt as good but still not bad at all. The inner liner has almost a neoprene but its perforated so that breathes pretty well. The actual woven upper is definitely woven much more densely than the standard flyknit. The upper is really flexible still because its knit but the Pumas definitely have some solid structuring behind the upper so they arent as sock like as the nikes. These feel like really running shoes I wouldnt try to run in these but I think you could. The outsole has a ton of support and even the upper locks you in pretty well. Im really enjoying this shoe since getting it. Im surprised how they are more complex than my pure boosts yet are lighter. ,Sneakers,crd9zfs,2,t5_2qrtt

This pulls up a decent amount of smalltime reseller marketplaces whose prices are relatively competitive. I grabbed a pair of BHM Kobe  Elites that way for  including shipping despite the going rate approaching  or better on some sites.Otherwise I dont spend too much time hunting. If I want to afford the shoe and want to own it badly enough I just make it happen. Hunting is missings ugly consequence. EDIT There are a few usual suspects I visit when I feel like spending some money on sneakers though  outside of the obvious like NDC KITH Finish Line and the Foot Locker family. Some youll know some you may not Flight Club Penny OS Life zachshoescom on Ebay  as of late after a great experience.Probably forgetting some. ,Sneakers,cs26vpf,6,t5_2qrtt

4914312,0,t3_3i7l9t,I just got the blue ones. Couldnt find in store anywhere so I got them off Amazon. I did not heed the warnings to go with a size down so make sure you do that please! Theyre huge. Also theyre not super comfortable. The tubular sole looks cool but it is hard. Im hoping it breaks in after a while. Its not so uncomfortable you wont want to wear them but if youre going out for the day and know youre going to be doing a lot of walking just be advised.Also Ive found the tubular sole to be challenging driving. Your foot slips off the pedals and you cant get a good grip. I take my right shoe off to drive now when I wear them ya know so I dont die.,Sneakers,cudzicm,2,t5_2qrtt

If the shoes give you utility beyond the amount that they are worth then you are acting rationally by keeping them.  I was only pointing out that if you believe that to be true then thats how you could shut up an economist.If you dont believe that the shoes provide you with more utility than their worth then you should sell them or else you are acting irrationally from an economic standpoint.  ,Sneakers,cy7wqb5,1,t5_2qrtt

6789117,0,t3_48qivu,Ive got a pair of Gellyte IIIs and Vs. Some places say they are true to size but they probably run a little bit snug. I think because of the weird way they do their sizing. Most of my shoes are USUKEU but the gel lytes are USUKEU. so I think they are just a bit smaller than usual. It doesnt make them uncomfortable especially as they loosen up a little bit but it will depend on your foot. Besides the gel lyte there is also the gel lyte evo gel saga gel kayano and gel respector which I think are reasonably popular. I think the Asics general release colour ways are nice and you can get them pretty cheap if you wait it out. Their collaborations are also really dope but they tend to sell out faster. ,Sneakers,d0lu1zv,4,t5_2qrtt

7221718,0,t1_d1yo5fk,Yeah so the Ultra Boost is a shoe by adidas. adidas can be the make ultra boost can be the model like a car. Ultra Boosts themselves arent rare. They do restocks online every so often and a lot of stores carry them.There are certain colorslooks aka colorways of the Ultra Boost that are rare. The CreamChalk colorway was limited and just had a small rerelease at Champs this past week. There are things called collabs adidas teams up with a magazine or website or some other company and dragons the look of a shoe with them. adidas x Wood Wood is an example or adidas x Highsnobiety just released is another. The collabs are very limited and will sell out immediately almost always and will have a high resell value. These dont show up at normal shoe stores like Foot Locker you either purchase them online or through boutiques.To answer your question these are the ones in the link. There are two Black Ultra Boosts. One is Core Black which is all black. The other is Black Gradient which has Gray on the toe. Both are very nice and both are GR general release so they can be bought anywhere. ,Sneakers,d1z1z1o,1,t5_2qrtt

7811420,0,t1_d3tr22q,gtNot buy them at all?Well yeah I know that you cant blame one guy for everyone elses actions but that doesnt mean its a good thing. Resellers fuck up the game for everyone and while its inevitable that doesnt mean that its the right thing to do if a significant portion of sneakerhead dont resell or purchase shoes for resale prices the market will collapse and everyone will be much happier overall. Purchasing shoes with the specific intent of reselling is just selfish instead of letting everyone get the shoes they want they would rather hoard them and charge a ton for their own personal gain I wont blame people who buy simply because they want it but making a purchase simply because theyre greedy and want more moneyshoes is just scummy.,Sneakers,d3u2gti,2,t5_2qrtt

Yes its varying shades of grey at the global retailer scale exclusive of production of course.Id like to pick your brain about economies of scale. HampM is able to sell a shirt for basically no profit cents to single dollars of profit but relies on selling huge amounts of that shirt to turn a meaningful profit.

Boost and Primeknit are more comfortable than Air and Flyknit and the Yeezy line is the most popular celebrity shoe right now. Theyve been able to leverage the hysteria for Yeezys right across their range its why kids camp out for generalrelease NMDs and unlike Nike their designs are contemporary and forwardthinking.

7982800,0,t1_d4dby09,Upper is a new style of mesh where its not form fitting too much but not flimsy like primeknit. Its at a good balancing point to me. Try looking at a hella close up picture I took www.imgur.comfqlbeYrThe Bounce technology is nowhere near as pillowlike and squishy as Boost its more firm and responsive. I like to compare it to Nikes Lunarlon. Personally for running I would take Bounce over Boost any day. The outsole is also designed in a way where you are less likely to kill yourself if you misstep. The ridges on the bottom helps prevent that. Ultra boost still reigns supreme as the comfort gods though! Alpha Bounce is much better than Mesh NMDs but PK NMDs are still more comfy. Basically anything PK gt Alpha Bounce gt Mesh for comfort. ,Sneakers,d4dcbtp,24,t5_2qrtt

8016412,0,t1_d4h13qg,I dont know why youre telling me this a month later but yeah I know I specifically have had the pair in the picture in a different color. The problem with boost is you absolutely need a lot of it to actually feel it. I have had many shoes with small amounts of boost like these ZX boost and you dont really feel it much. If you have seen these in person its just a small insole that has some boost on the heel. Ultra boosts are literally the most comfortable boosts because they actually use a lot of it same can be said with the original pure boost in my opinion but the ultra boost is still bettermore stable. ,Sneakers,d4h4axf,1,t5_2qrtt

Nike mass produces their shoes and besides Jordans and maybe the Flyknit Racers in certain colors their shoes sit on the shelves because of it. Its kind of why Roshe runs fell out of flavor simply because they became to easy to obtain allowing everyone to own a pair and the exclusiveness faded. ,Sneakers,d5fft71,1,t5_2qrtt

They are great for moving around and are very comfortable especially when you compare it to the ZX Flux. Theres also a bunch of different colorways for the Fresh Foams if you really want to find something that looks good with your outfit. Another thing I like about the foams is the price I have found them in the clearance racks of around five local stores and I picked my pair up for  USD. And it has been one of my gym shoes for half a year now so I would say its really worth the price. Ofc it may be different there but Im guessing you could probably find good deals for them.Aesthetically I dont think the foams look as good as the rest of your list but if my day job involves a lot of moving and playing with children I would absolutely stick with the fresh foams.,Sneakers,d6i2st3,1,t5_2qrtt

9704366,0,t3_5e2mqw,I do not suggest ultra boosts for running. They are comfortable but dont have enough support stability durability etc for running. Especially if you plan on doing train running. Brands I recommend are Hoka One One pretty ugly and bulky but a great running shoe Mizuno they have some pretty unique running shoes like the wave prophecy. Havent tried them personally but Ive heard good things asics the gel kayano  doesnt look too bad and is pretty popular brooks Alta saucony My advice get a shoe thats comfortable and ignore the looks. Id rather run comfortably and have ugly shoes than have my feet hurt but be able to flex on people around me or other runners who usually dont give a shit anyways. In fact if you wear good running shoes like hoka other serious runners will know ur legit.,Sneakers,da99rux,6,t5_2qrtt

9720049,0,t1_daayc3d,I have the black pair and theyre not waterproof.  the neoprene bootie provides some nice warmth around the ankle however the ripstop material on the toe box is durable but very thin this area lets in the most water and the fuse layer is as well so your toes will get cold.In my experience here in Toronto these dont hold up for snowy or wet weather Ive gone out in these in heavy rain and my socks were drenched. youre better off getting a proper sneakerboot like the AF or AM versions.  on light rainy days you might get by but dont count on it.That being said theyre great in person.  I havent noticed any squeaking but Ive read people complaining about the toe box material making some crunching noise as they step as its a bit stiff but I havent noticed that either.I love them as dry weather sneakers but winterized is a bit misleading.   ,Sneakers,dab7h9u,8,t5_2qrtt

Not really the ideal option for many but can be appealing to those looking to quickly put them on like triathlons.  for running shoes this is crappy.  Lock laces are preferred for speed.

Its just excess glue from the manufacturing process and is better than having too little glue which you would not realize until your shoe separates.

Especially in this case using acetone at the connection of the sole and the upper is likely breaking down and weakening the adhesivenessbonding of the glueto some unknown extentat the connectionseam between those parts of the shoe.

10719723,0,t3_5t9gb3,The Mars Blackmon character that Jordan Brand and Spike Lee created was pretty cool and I think sorta ground breaking. It was the first sneaker ad campaign i remember that featured   a celebrity cameo and a particular style black and white a little comedy quick MTV style cuts that became a formula Nike copied for future releases like  the Bo Jackson and Penny Hardaway campaigns. Imo it helped Jordan Brand become iconic and a monster brand in the late s and early s.Really you should look at all the ad campaigns for Jordan . Nike wrote the book on creating a line around one athlete and they created some awesome campaigns each year for the new Jordans. Someone already mentioned Space Jam and that was a huge campaign but definitely look at all the ads Nike was churning out in MJs playing days. Next is the BO KNOWS Nike campaign. Tons of celebrity and athlete cameos and a tag line that became something that even people with no sneakerhead tendencies knew by heart. Bo Jackson had the whole country watching every time he took a hand off or came to the plate and that Nike campaign was fucking everywhere. The little penny Nike campaign was also huge. Again celebrities involved Chris rock voices Little Penny and an ad that even non sneakerheads knew. Little Penny was everywhere. Also probably wanna look into the history of Nikes JUST DO IT campaign. That slogan is synonymous with Nike and any one in advertising will tell you it was an absolute slam Dunk for Nike. Shaqs reebok line was a big marketing deal. Shaq was a phenom and to see a company other than Nike handle a line that took cues from the Jordan line was interesting. Also since we are talking Reebok definitely look into the first campaign for the Reebok Pump. That pump was a huge deal when  it first came out. People were clamoring for Pumps. Maybe look into Dee Brown and how his dunk contest moment along with Shaq helped Pumps become the new cool gimmick. Finally take a look at the converse campaign featuring Magic and Larry Bird. Had a funny take on their rivalry and was the first ads I remember that featured  athletes in the same ad for the same shoe. Hope this help. Good luck.Edit  I had to look and see if I got Dee Browns name right and came across this. Talks about the Dunk contest pump moment and of the Nike v Reebok wars of the early s,Sneakers,ddlnruh,3,t5_2qrtt

This may or may not include additional accessories laces special packaging etc. As with sneakers sold at retail some pairs will pass Deadstock inspection despite being unlaced tried on for fitment andor slight manufacturer flaws and imperfections that are uncontrollable. Be aware Deadstock sneakers can include signs of aging when it comes to older pairs including slight yellowing and should be worn at your own risk. In addition all Deadstock sneakers should include the original box which may have encountered minimal damage from shipping discoloration from storage andor any normal wear and tear due to aging.I emailed them to make sure what the guidelines were for them. ,Sneakers,dehi8g6,1,t5_2qrtt

Orders take  days processing sometimes and if you cant be patient with that then youre ordering from the wrong place or honestly youre just not patient enough.

I copped the Royals this year because I like how they look but theyre not as historically significant as the Breds though thats not a huge deal for me.I dont really care which retro it is I just like the colorway. Like I wouldnt spend more money on  breds over  breds just to be able to say theyre  breds. As far as wearability goes I would take my fake shattered backboards over  breds because I couldnt bring myself to wear  breds and Im not a big enough collector to display them or anything.I wear my fake SBBs because nobody around here even knows what s are. You see plenty of people wearing s and s but nobody even recognizes s. Nobody would walk past me and think holy shit that guy is wearing  shoes. Theyre just Nike high tops to other people.
