5364994,0,t1_cvwo681,No! Please rant forever! I am a writerthis invigorates me!Completely agree about the SMeyer thingand how its prolly not gonna be rr. Id like to hear more about your ideas on female character development though. Especially in how it might to contrast against male character development. I try to write in a way thats equal to every body. As much noise has been made about media being unfair to female characters I think the same can easily be said of male characters also.Please please rant some more! D ,RoleReversal,cvxfsy7,1,t5_359dt

There are some writers on ds gfd thread but honestly none of them are all that good.As for finding the nongfdamprr femdom stuff well the odds are good but the goods are not. They dont normally pack the emotional content like Taiyakisobas stories or Rusfemanons audios or obscure  manga.With that said if you want a bit longer rr story theres two options I know Piers Anthonys Ship of Mustard and the genderflipped version of Twilight that Mayer released some months ago. ,RoleReversal,d15kxy1,1,t5_359dt

Must be a normie thing.,RoleReversal,d1cdgfb,2,t5_359dt
