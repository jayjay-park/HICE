10026472,0,t3_5izlkw,I feel like I have seen a lot of milling decks online also but I think that is because milling is very theory craft chic.  Its fun to think about and draft up deck strategies and cardlists that optimize this win condition because you can visualize what playing that deck will look like and it matters much less what your opponent is playing at least compared to other deck builds.But the real fun in Destiny comes from actual games since they are quick and offer a lot of variety based on card draw and your opponents deckplaystyle.Milling is just a vogue topic for people to write about because other deck types aggro control swarm etc. are a lot less interesting on the page.  The beauty of these strategies only really becomes apparent during gameplay.,swdestiny,dbeh6g5,1,t5_3fo27

10209093,0,t1_dc18mov,Yeah it definitely can help an aggro deck finish off a character quickly but then you have the tradeoff that your disrupt and discard sides dont synergize with the rest of the deck.

10219413,0,t1_dc254c6,I think that they would just have the character be both of the colours in these situations instead of creating mixed colours.  It does seem like something that will eventually happen for character and possibly even upgradesupportevent cards.,swdestiny,dc2ff4g,1,t5_3fo27

10300944,0,t3_5nh52h,Noone is doing this as far as I can see but the strongest mill deck Ive built is ERey Trooper padme focusing on discard dice.You can include stuff like patiencejedi academy in this deck to make time to mill lower.Can beat your EVeers EJango deck on a good day.Villain the eJabba  Dooku Vader is pretty devastating as it will wreck your hand every turn with discard.eJabba has the pretty giant caveat that the game cannot end in less than  turns though which means most aggro decks will have killed you by then.,swdestiny,dcbo1r4,2,t5_3fo27

10350813,0,t1_dcha29w,Dooku definitely works and is probably my first instinct. Jango is ranged damage but I could see that working as well because Electroshock gets rid of Falcon on half of its sides.,swdestiny,dchbpah,1,t5_3fo27
10354548,0,t3_5o81pu,Not to toot my own horn but i think i really did just play well too.

10363752,0,t1_dcio0wd,Yeah this is more of a control deck than aggro it can still deal a lot of damage but it does it at a much slower pace. It has the added benefit of having more health and longer staying power with all the extra die removal.,swdestiny,dcisjy7,1,t5_3fo27

10465779,0,t3_5pu8dh,The tension of both players watching for the outcome of a dice roll. It reminds me a little of watching the flop or subsequent deals in poker.

10486576,0,t1_dcwr2xt,If you just want to play casually Kylo starter vs Rey starter is a lot of fun so one of each is just fine. If you want to play competitively or with most players out there decks require  cards a Battlefield and up to  points worth of character cards and dice which is why you would want  of each deck. You would get some excess cards but that would give you both some options in terms of customizing your decks.

10621896,0,t3_5s0ozt,For me this card is tied with backup muscle for best in the game. Especially when combined with It Binds All Things and used to overwrite another card like Jedi Robes. Amazing utility. On top of that it doesnt make the target on the attached character much bigger since it becomes a support when the character is defeated. I think its best to keep it on a character as long as possible just for action economy with rolling dice. Just a great card IMO. ,swdestiny,ddbkgeo,4,t5_3fo27

10666887,0,t1_ddg46v5,There are local scenes stores or countries that have no scene and finding  booster boxes is certainly possible. Were not a representative group here.  I would guess the cash value of the singles of an MSRP booster box is still higher. You average  Legendaries per box yeah? The cheapest ones are still around  so even with relatively poor luck youve got  of product. Pull a Vader or Force Throw and youve broken even. Aggregate your commons and uncommons into playsets and youre going to make a nice profit. Its a lot of work and bookkeeping but it beats McDonalds. ,swdestiny,ddg7ig8,1,t5_3fo27

10711519,0,t1_ddknvwh,Its pretty hard to lose actually Make sure you stay ahead of the dice curve. Doing damage early isnt important you want to play  if not  upgrade per turn.Once your ahead on dice you have a lot of ways to take out veers I usually have him down by turn . Dont be scared to throw away upgrades you wont need to reroll some dice you need to do  damage each turn or gain a bunch of shields.Burn veers protect rey and then control him with your superior dice pool.A lot of times what happens is veers will go down then they kill rey. They end up with a jango usually with  upgrades at this point and you will have a quigon with   a loose one with the force. That gives you  dice vs  which is game over because your dice are better.Deflect is godly  ranged dice can be removed to do  damage its brutal.Good luck!,swdestiny,ddkt9x3,1,t5_3fo27

10787135,0,t3_5u9xhk,I feel like Cunning would shine in this deck. Your description states that you are looking to abuse Ackbars dice to hit more Padme specials I feel like Cunning could help. Also Thermal Detonator if you have it is a scary card in its own right that helps with the mill plan.,swdestiny,ddsm5km,1,t5_3fo27
10793237,0,t3_5u9xhk,Ive played a version of thisBut after a couple of games that were the local meta alot of Jango fast decks I did a bunch of tweaks.I put in the following and had great success against BalaTrooperePhasma and eVaderRaider. And I won two times against another milldeck VadereJabba  x Millenium Falcon for some damage and the  discard x Dodge witch you need for any deck in the meta x Hyperspace Jump If you need too change the battlefield too youre choice. If you won the roll of you can just use it too end the turn x Dug in x Defensive position I also use Jedi temple for the stress. Your opponent will claim just so you wont and heshe will claim before they are done with their turn and all their rerolls.If they focus Ackbar which they usually do Use field medic draw attention and shield him up and when he goes down you will most likely have a second chance diplomatic immunity and keep Padme alive. Its really fun too play and gives the game another playtype,swdestiny,ddt8v89,1,t5_3fo27

Youre sitting across from someone who must do the same.  So if I am intentionally being slovenly during a game I either have no respect for my fellow player or are intentionally obscuring info.In poker does the dealer throw your cards across the table in between you and another player?In checkers or chess should I put the pieces within the square they are occupying or should I place them half in one square half in the other?You feel me?

Without official confirmation from Lukas himself neither of us can be sure. The rule you claim is unambiguous can be interpreted as such from my previous post the rule you are quoting from the RRG seems to refer to the situation in which you are discarding an upgrade without interference from the opponent such as with playing a new upgrade over an old one or in the case of moving a redeploy weapon and replacing an upgrade.,swdestiny,ddzujox,2,t5_3fo27

11083321,0,t1_deo9k2t,Yeah theres an inherent problem that this card has no matter the color. If youre not going to use the extra cards why are you drawing them now instead of during your upkeep? And if you ARE going to use the extra cards why are you ok with  milling yourself so much in a single turn?           But with that said I think youre right Yellow could probably do well with this card. I play a Hired Guns deck that usually has money for days and sometimes I wouldnt mind having more to do when my opponent has already claimed. I also played against a JabbaJango deck yesterday that amassed  resources at once. If he could have used this card in that scenario to just fish for a Crime Lord it would have been devastating. So if you had the resources and the right build to capitalize on it maybe this card would work. I understand that they wanted it to synergize with Dooku but Blue just isnt there right now and splashing for Blue isnt always easy. Maybe something will happen with it in the future though. Who knows?,swdestiny,deoa99r,1,t5_3fo27

11123091,0,t3_5ysrif,No Mercy.Lets talk about this card. Its a game winner for me so many times sheerly out of surprise. Say youre running Vader and you get three damage. Youre looking at an enormous shift in momentum with this card bonus points if you send the enemy to Greedoland unexpectedly. Unfortunately the downside of this card is it benefits tremendously from having a full hand and being willing to say Nah I dont need it. Its a game ender but I dont see it getting a lot of use outside of a very quick and surprising murder. Another downside is youll often see this card when you have a hand of the wrong color. Right now? Its a pretty decent card. When Emperor hits this card is going to be bananas. Imagine me spelling bananas like Im a hollaback girl. Thats when this card is going to really hit its stride.,swdestiny,dessked,4,t5_3fo27

11432366,0,t3_637d0e,him with rey and go all out on the Awakening modified side support option?  Sadly Hero has really limited options for  or less points literally just ackbar  mon mothma both of which I feel do not go with him then just rey maz and snap all of which also feel weird and not strong enough to pair with him.  Then of course the fact that hero has no  cost nonunique and that instantly means no nonunique setup is available to chirrut.  So then other than that single die poe baze chewy etc.  Best options probably being Jyn and Luke as they still have a good ability for one die I would probably start there or with Rey.,swdestiny,dfrui1d,3,t5_3fo27

This would also incentivize players to target him early so he doesnt get to trigger the healing many times if at all. The Grand Inquisitor probably does cost too little.
