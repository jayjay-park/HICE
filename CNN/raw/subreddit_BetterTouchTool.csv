7875100,0,t3_4n0x06,Are you sure you have configured it correctly? The modifier keys which are shown directly below a gesture are used to limit the triggering of the selected gesture e.g. if cmd is checked the gesture will only be triggered while cmd is pressed.If you want a gesture to trigger cmdw you need to click the shortcut field and press cmdw simultaneously.You could post a screenshot of your configuration this will make it easier to help.Best Andreas ,BetterTouchTool,d418fel,1,t5_38d66

10625830,0,t1_ddalqoj,Did this and they really tried to help but apparently hes not the only one and theres nothing they can do about it at the moment. It sounds like its pretty widespread with a whole host of disabilities.I thought there would be a solution. It seems its just cross your fingers and wait for Apple.,BetterTouchTool,ddbz1qs,1,t5_38d66
