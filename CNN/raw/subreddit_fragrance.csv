3195522,0,t3_2wpy79,Here is a good explanation of the term aromatic in perfumegtStrictly speaking the chemical definition relates aromatic to materials rich in benzene a conjugated cyclic carbon compound found in organic matter also known as arene. Penhaligons Douro is an example if you need to put a smell to a name. Aromatic in layman speak refers to smells that have a rustic scent with a certain freshness often in relation to herbal notes some sources correlate it even to some balsams and resins. Arent balsams and resins generally sweetish though? you ask.You see the term aromatic was originally assigned before the physical mechanism determining aromaticity was discovered and was derived from the fact that many of the benzene hydrocarbon compounds have a sweet scent in themselves. Its safe to say that in perfumery parlance aromatic has gradually gained a specific nuance that of agrestic greenherbal and with a camphorous hint like that in pure lavender essence. The character is vivid assertive lively and fresh one of mental clarity invigoration and awareness associations prominently exploited by functional perfumery i.e. the industry catering for scented functional products instead of fine fragrances for oneself.Aromatics is also a cooking term it refers to stuff like garlic onions celery herbs and other stuff that imparts flavor but is not necessarily eaten. ,fragrance,cot7s5m,5,t5_2sda0

That being said regular testing is done on fragrance compounds. Even ingredients that have the potential to cause such minor things as skin irritation in a small portion of the population have been banned.

The first oriental fragrance Shalimarhad a reputation for being a fragrance for younger bad girls whereas fresh clean florals were thought of as being prim and proper and either virginal or matronly.  Thats an example involving womens fragrances but  I think that young vs old has more to do with style than fragrance category.

You also wont get the projection that the real fragrances have especially because they are oil based. You would probably be better off getting a decant from a split. Because Tom Ford does sell big flacons splits can be found where you are paying less per ml than if you bought a smaller bottle at retail. There are some alternatives I know of that arent bad. For instance David Yurman Limited Edition has a nice leather raspberry accord like Tuscan Leather and also  adds a touch of very nice rose plus a bit of oud.

To do that you have to be knowledgeable about what to look for on the bottle or box that identifies it as vintage. Some are easier to tell than others. I also go to yard sales and estate sales.

A loud perfume in an enclosed public space says either I dont give a shit about anyone around me or Notice meeeee!!!! Which doesnt really conjure up images of professionalism. The fragrance itself could have several different opinions about it depending who you ask. For example I wouldnt see a sugary scent as professional but someone else might see a more refined scent as unprofessional because it doesnt have enough youth and vibrancy. I dont think you could measure it on the actual scent because of that but I reckon nearly everyone would agree that too loud is wrong for a work environment. ,fragrance,d0zns6h,17,t5_2sda0

6960430,0,t1_d15a7iu,If its a diffuser fragrance the tactic may be different. Ill speak to a normal cologneperfume instead.One of the hallmarks of modern ingedients is that theyve rendered the scent pyramid semiobsolete.  Now we have things that smell like topnotes but last like basenotes. Sophia Grojsman sort of pioneered that style.Designer fragrances are mostly made up of hedione iso e super galaxolide etc.Start with the base. My gut for this says that a  ratio of timbersilkoudgalaxolide is about right. It might need a bit of sweetening with a little bit of coumarinvanillinsomething though. Add stank to taste.When you make the topmiddle separately and then just dump them on you often end up with funky top notes because the base modifies them so much and they were developed without that.Pick the next note preferably a middle note that you want to work on and start adding it in until it feels about right. Do the same with the next and the next until youre happy with the whole thing.The ratio depends a lot. I find that I have the best luck when I just sort of slowly add to the same composition so I get an idea of how everything goes together. You might need to stop and go back and add more of something you already put in because its not as pronounced as it was in the beginning with all the other stuff youve added.It is however sometimes helpful to make an accord outside of the general mix and then add that as a single ingredient.Tldr those rules are kinda BS.P.S. If you want to do it old school the Jean Carles ratio is  base  heart  top.,fragrance,d15at35,1,t5_2sda0

With the way people in the community were hyping it up I was expecting some irresistible smoky pineapple masterpiece that would leave my nose permanently affixed to my wrist. But when I sprayed it on instead of being able to pick out individual notes I was instantly reminded of one of the AxeTag body sprays I practically bathed in when I was  or  years old.

7655852,0,t1_d3c8pwy,Yeah I figured Id just take the plunge and get them while I could get a discount on them not sure how often that happens.  In any case Ive tested three of the five and am happy to report that I love all of the ones Ive tried so far!  Not a surprise because the ones Ive used are the Lys Jasmin and Fleur DOranger and I am on a bit of a white floral rampage at the moment so it was kind of a given that Id like these.  They are all very different though!  Id say the Lys and Fleur DOranger are very linear they barely change at all as I wear them and they are fairly soft with moderate to low sillage but they last forever.  I was kind of horrified with the Jasmin initially because at first spritz it smelled overwhelmingly like some kind of citrus cleaning product that had been sprayed over mothballs  it was like a freaking assault on my nose.  That lasted for about an hour and a half.  Then it started drying down and now it has been about  hours since I put it on and I am getting the most wonderful sort of vanillajasmine tea smell from it.  I had seen someone comment that you need to wait at least  minutes after application to smell a Le Labo fragrance and I think that is pretty true.  Even the ones I liked from the beginning smell way way better after they have dried down a bit.  I didnt dare try Santal  because I simply could not put up with smelling like a pickle for an hour or two thats what many have likened the opening to but I am sure the dry down is absolutely beautiful.  Id like to smell it on someone else but not myself lol.  Ill be trying the Bergamote and Ylang tomorrow. ,fragrance,d3cfepl,1,t5_2sda0

If it was a  fragrance or a  fragrance Id tell you to go for it but if youre paying  for it Id suggest that you enjoy   wearings of it before buying the bottle.  Tobacco Vanille is another fragrance like that.  I really enjoyed it on first smell but I quickly found myself growing tired of it.  Everyones opinions differ and it may become your all time favorite but its not such a beloved fragrance in the community that people are going to tell you that its a killer deal and that youll continue to find hidden depth and beauty in it.

My least favorite of the Mont Blanc I have there. I dont know exactly how to describe it and I havent had a chance to really test it either.Starwalker however is surprisingly nice. Its very brightcitrusy and with some woodmusk and it holds on to that citrusy feel for a long time. It doesnt completely smell like but very much reminds me of Dior Homme Cologne.

11720577,0,t1_dgobpf7,This is really a great comment. Fragrances are like clothes you cannot wear the same outfit for every occasion or be comfortable in all weather. Just like you cannot wear shorts and tshirts during a snowstorm you cannot wear Virgin Island Water Creed in the middle of winter and expect to be comfortable. On the other hand if you wear that setup to the beach its a different story entirely.Id recommend something like Versace Eros or Pure Malt for clubbing. They are sweet they project massively and work wonders in crowded sweaty rooms. For class Id say Versace Pour Homme Dylan Blue Bleu de Chanel or one of the mild Vetiver fragrances would be great like Tom Ford.Versace Pour Homme is probably the least offensive fragrance I own. It just smells like freshlyshowered dude and while the longevity and projection are limited you could spray half a bottle on yourself and probably not get any complaints. It wont blow anyone away but it also wont piss anyone off and sometimes thats the most important thing particularly in a professional setting. ,fragrance,dgok0wt,3,t5_2sda0

Encre Noir is easy enough to find. Leo and Equus are my favorites from them. Just make sure you get the EdP. Leo is a great blend of lavender vanilla and woods. Ill take a look around and see if I have any empty sample bottles. If you are in the States I could send you some. ,fragrance,dgy36a9,3,t5_2sda0
