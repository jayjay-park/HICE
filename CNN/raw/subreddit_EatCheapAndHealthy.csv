83534,0,t1_cen640s,Precisely. And hell not even just adult taste buds. Some  years ago I stopped eating oranges and tangerines due to my father giving me a half gallon of OJ and me having the stomach flu. I literally could not even stomach the smell of an orange for a good portion of my life. But I wanted to eat healthy and get more fruits and veggies in me and oranges are cheap. I started slow very slow. Literally peeled an orange set it aside. Worked up my bravery ate a slice. Ate another slice later and another. Now I eat oranges as my casual snack I love them.

It didnt evolve to assimilate nutrients that were leached out a vegetable using boiling water.A humans digestive system is almost identical to a chimps except that our colons are shorter and our oral cavities produce more amylase.  So the biggest changes from chimps based on our anatomy is that  we cant profitably eat twigs anymore and  we can process starchy shit like grains and tubers better.  If the stuff that people are telling you to eat doesnt taste good to you dont eat it.

145005,0,t3_1vonre,As several people have already said adding vegies to your pasta sauce is a great way to start branching out. Chuck an onion a couple of cloves of garlic some carrot chunks and celery sticks into a food processor if you cant be bothered with chopping fry it all up before adding your meat and tomatoes. You can also add mushrooms chopped eggplant capsicum and lots of herbs like parsley basil and oregano to this before you even start noticing that youre not just eating meat and tomato.Once you have that sorted you can just riff on the theme to travel the world. Also all of these could also be made with chicken or turkey mince to make them a bit lower in fat. Buy a curry paste and add that in place of some of the tomato forget about the herbs for this one add frozen peas about  minutes before youre finished cooking and serve it with rice instead of pasta. Use brown rice for extra nuttiness and its better for you. You just made keema curry. Make the same mix but use less tomato so its not too saucy. Steam some potatoes and mash them with some milk and butter. Put the mince mix in a dish followed by a can of creamed corn followed by the mash then bake it in the oven for  minutes. Voila pate chinois Quebecois style shepherds pie. Use the same mince mix with no tomato but this time add some frozen peas and corn around  minutes before youre finished cooking. Use cilantro and shallots instead of the herbs. Add some sweet chilli sauce and soy sauce and serve it in lettuce cups. Now youve made sang choy bow. In a biggish ovenproof pot use the same mince mix again with no tomato but this time throw in a handful of dried fruit sultanas or raisins dates apricots and nuts pine nuts almonds pistachios cashews peanuts and some middle eastern spice mix use parsley alone here or forget about herbs. Add a cup of rice and fry it up a bit then add  cups of stock or water or halfhalf bring it to the boil cover it and put it in a medium oven  till its cooked about  minutes.  Serve with salad and pita for a middle eastern feast extra points for making some dips alongside. For hommous throw a drained can of chickpeas into a food processor with a tablespoon or so of tahini juice of a lemon a teaspoon of garlic a glug of olive oil and salt and pepper. Blend it and add the reserved liquid from the can progressively until you have the consistency you want. For tzatziki grate a cucumber and squeeze the liquid out then mix with greek yoghurt lemon juice olive oil salt and pepper.Good luck!,EatCheapAndHealthy,ceuy3rq,2,t5_2vvpi

178291,0,t3_1w4xyc,Build up a base of sandwich stuff soups salads and ricebeans. You wont be able to start for under  but youll be able to maintain for even less than that for just one person. For example To start sandwiches youll need bread mayo mustard two or three meats for variety a cheese one or two accents pepperoni soppressata the deli cuts are frequently clearance items for  off when nobodys buying. But weekly youll only need to pick up  pound of deli meat for about  and a loaf of bread for about the same. Maybe some cheese every third week I recommend Muenster. Can probably keep yourself in all the sandwiches you want for  a week easily.Soups go well with sandwiches as do chips.  cans of soup and a bag of chips every other week.Rice from the bulk bin will be cheap as hell and last you forever. Dry beans as well. This is a staple and should pad your menu at least  times a week. Along with eggs its very versatile and easy to adjust to your tastes.So to sum up start building a stable of easy things that you like to eat and only buy what you need week by week. Say this week instead of eating out all  days only eat out  days and cook the other . Itll take some practice and youll throw away moldy unused ingredients and leftovers occasionally till you get things dialed in. But itll save you buckets of money.

664632,0,t3_21qsbf,During my time as a single guy I focused a LOT of my cooking efforts on stuff tossed into a slow cooker.  Its a shame that you guys dont do pork Im guessing for religious reason because pork is very inexpensive and turns out awesome when cooked in a crockpot with veggies for  hours.  If hes a meat and potatoes or pasta guy Id be worried that as you guys get older if this isnt an issue already then packing on the extra pounds could be a problem.  I struggled with the same thing after I got hurt and wasnt as active as I should be for a while.  Keeping to lean cuts of meat and away from sweet sauces savory typically have less sugar so fewer calories helped a lot.  So did eating home cooked meals instead of fast food a good home cooked meal kicks the hell out of a fast food burger or taco any day too. Get a good sized piece of beef  pounds of whatever is cheapest cut per pound trim off all the fat stick it in a crockpot and pack the crockpot around it with a whole head of garlic cloves just halved and rough chopped vegetables like carrots onions peppers.  Pour in  beers I typically use something dark like Guinness to impart some flavor even when using a dark beer it will only be a slight flavor most will cook out so using something light like a pilsner or hefeweizen isnt going to work as well. Let it cook for a long time on low.  I typically started these meals the night before  pm and let them cook until dinner the next day.  They were always awesome and I got at least a couple days of leftovers.  The meat carved up onto sandwiches kicks ass or you can toss a serving into some tupperware and send it with him for lunch my wife does this for me now when we make the same kind of meals. The best part of this is that the meat can be frozen solid and this still works I would buy a gigantic cut of beef like a whole shoulder at Sams Club and preportion it into  pound pieces in  gallon ziploc bags then double wrap it in aluminum foil to hold it into a nice stackable shape for my freezer a shape that fits in your crock pot.  If the meat isnt frozen and youve got a little time to make this the morning on the day of instead of the night before you can slice the meat in a spiral pattern so it looks like a rolled up towel and spread a thick seasoning paste between the layers.  To make the paste toss in a whole red onion  red and  green bell peppers minus the seed balls a couple cloves of elephant garlic theyre easier to peel than normal garlic and Im lazy two tablespoons of rosemary  teaspoons of salt and a  teaspoons of black pepper into my food processor and run it until it was a paste it will be a bit runny as the salt is leeching water from the vegetables so then add a tablespoon of cornmeal at a time and pulse it again until youve got a thick wet paste that isnt runny.  Unroll the beef and spread it on very thick like  inch thick then roll it back up.  Toothpick it together to hold it in place.  This can be done the night before and if youre doing that then toss it back into the refrigerator in a large covered bowl.  Next on the morning of sear all sides of your beef roll for about  minutes each in a very hot pan with about  of oil.  You should have visible sear on the sides and that char will add a lot of complexity in flavor and texture to your meal. Toss that into a crockpot pack it with vegetables add a beer cook for  hours and have a kickass dinner.  Adding a ricecooker to your kitchen equipment helps too for rice what I do is make  cup of rice and  large sweet potato cut into small cubes this will satisfy his need for carbs and if you buy brown rice you can help to not fatten him up so much.  Sweet potato is much better for you than rice or pasta so if you keep the cubes small and mix it well he shouldnt bitch too much unless he likes sweet potato then go to . large sweet potatoes per cup of rice.  I typically serve the meat and vegetables over the sweet potatorice mix.  My kids love it and on nights when the wife is working its a great meal that I can do most of the time consuming prep the night before chop all vegetables and do the meat and have it in the crock pot in  minutes before i run to work.  When I get home I toss the rice and the already chopped sweet potato into the rice cooker rice then water then sweet potato and turn it on.   minutes later dinner is ready.

1873248,0,t3_2g13ap,Lol...when I started university I didnt like mushrooms asparagus onions peppers and more. P I agree with someone that said your taste buds do change as you get older. I think a lot of people dont like vegetables because it wasnt made right. My dad always just boiled vegetables in the past and when overcooked theyre not exactly tasty. Now I quickly steam my vegetables and eat it asis and they come out of a frozen bag from Costco.I would recommend trying to master one basic at a time. My friend was teaching me how to cook and we just made chicken breasts together and I can cook up a really delicious and juicy chicken breast now. Its gross when its dry but now I got the basics down the possibilities are endless. Eat it with just salt and pepper buy cooking sauces stuff it with something and bake it...etc.Next I moved onto steak which is delicious and I barely eat steak outside in restaurants now... it only takes only  minutes to prepare and another few minutes to cook up some AAA beef. If youre not keen on vegetables maybe look into making fruitvegetable smoothies. Its not just a fad. It tastes like a regular smoothie is a good way to get your fruits and vegetables and is good for when youre in a rush. Mix in some cereal or seeds and it can be more filling. Also learn basic knife skills. It makes cooking a lot funner. I chop up a lot of leftover vegetables and just saute it before mixing it with a spaghetti sauce. Good way to get the vegetables in without feeling like youre eating vegetables and it adds a lot of flavour and texture. D ,EatCheapAndHealthy,ckex49y,1,t5_2vvpi

1937695,0,t3_2gth1m,I prefer my grandmothers chicken and dumplings. The recipe is extremely similar however instead of making flat rolled out dumplings she used bisquik and made these delicious fluffy cloud like dumplings. You mix the bisquick with water until it is about the consistency of cookie dough and then spoon it into the soup. Keep in mind the dumplings will expand as they cook so dont make them too big or they will be raw in the middle and you wont fit a lot of them in the pot. Once you put them in the soup you can dunk them down but do not stir the pot or you will end up with a thick delicious soup with no dumplings.  it took me years to figure out what I was doing wrong. All of my family and neighborhood friends used to beg grandma to make her famous chicken and dumplings and Im usually disappointed when I get a soup with flat dumplings.  I already have them on my refrigerator dinner list for sometime next week. I usually plan all my dinners in advance so I save time and money grocery shopping and cooking Edit I jusy looked at your recipe again and wanted to add put some carrots celery an onion and potatoes in there as well. It wont raise the price a lot but it adds even more flavor and gets some veggies in the meal.

2387818,0,t3_2mqgp7,? I would get down to LIDL or ALDI and top up on some of their own brand items below whatever you can afford tins of tomatoes or jars of passatta  a couple of tins of kidney beans  butter beans a packet of frozen peppers a packet of chicken stock cubes a pack of  eggs a pack of cooking bacon cheapest offcuts of pork that you would slice bacon from but is only about . for g milk plain flour butterWith your current ingredients and with some of the additions above you can easily knock up some great tasting recipes. If you are really concerned about your onions why not cook them all off at once on a low heat then reserve half for different meals and put in a freezer bag and retain the other half. With the second portion keep them in the same pan and cook for longer till you caramelise them adding a bit of sugar if you have some. Add your chicken stock and if you want a really meaty flavour you could always sprinkle in a few gravy granules for a great tasting version of a French onion soup not original but making do! You can even top off with croutons. With your bread unless you eat it for breakfast and I would use your porridge oats and half milk half water for that instead I would let it go stale and then shred it or blitz it up and keep it in the freezer. Then you have instant breadcrumbs to add on top of pasta dishes for thickening and texture purposes. With your tuna I would make a quick bechemel using the milk flour and butter you purchased then drain the cans of tuna and add to the sauce. Mix in salt and pepper and any herbs you fancy perhaps parsley and dill. Cook off your pasta of choice add to the tuna bechemel and bake in an oven with a sprinkling of your homemade breadcrumbs for a crunchy topping. With the microwaveable egg fried rice and normal rice you can knock up a quick Asian type of dish by adding this to some cooked onions and frozen peppers. Add whatever eastern spices you have to hand. Add some shredded pork as below if you wish. You can also use your packet of purchased eggs and brown rice for the same meal. With the cooking bacon bring to a boil in cold water then tip out that water and replace with fresh cold water to remove some of its saltiness. Bring it to the boil again but this time simmer gently for an hour. After this remove the pork and add your frozen peas to the pork stock. Shred half the pork for the pea and ham soup and retain the other half for dishes like the egg fried rice above. If you can either mash up the peas and stock or blitz it before adding the pork for a smoother soup.  The tins of tomatoes or jars of passata can be used in a myriad of ways for sauces to go with pasta. You could also do a tasty bean stew or soup by combining some onions peppers and garlic with a can of beans and some tomatoes before adding some chicken stock. The eggs can be used for omelettes or quick protein boosters at lunch by hard boiling them. If you have baking soda  yeast   bicarbonate of soda they are all cheap in single portions so you could pick up some from the shop I would recommend making a quick bread. Once you have done it you will easily be able to knock up a few rolls or loafs and that way you can have sandwiches or toast as a filler. Hope this helps. ,EatCheapAndHealthy,cm6ubjv,3,t5_2vvpi

2495691,0,t1_cmk0yg8,gt Stir fried rice is one of my goto cheap quick healthy meals!  I came here to say the same thing. I always make too much rice when I cook so I put it in the fridge so it gets kind of dried out. If you dont have leftover rice make fresh rice and spread out on plate or tray in freezer so it dries some. It makes it easier to cook in the pan.  Then I cook an onion in a large pan on medhigh for a few min. At the end I add garlic and ginger and cook for another min. This is bc I really like the flavor of the two and want it really strong. Adding the garlic and ginger earlier will make it a little more subtle just be sure not to burn either.  Add a little more oil and then the rice. Turn the heat down to med but anythings good as long as its not turning black. I cook that for a few minutes. Then add the soy sauce and egg. Mix everything up really good as you stir it. Constantly stir it for about  min. Add some sambal oelek or sriracha or something to your plate!  I dont really have measurements for this enough rice to fill the pan but not spill everywhere while you stir however many eggs you want but not more than say  as much garlic as you like a little smaller than an inchsized chunk of ginger PEELED and minced up however much soy sauce looks good to you.  Its usually something I make when Im down to my last egg or two and odds and ends otherwise. Its really good if you have some fresh vegetables to add in. I really like asparagus or broccoli in this but its pretty good plain. ,EatCheapAndHealthy,cmkbp8i,2,t5_2vvpi

2744521,0,t1_cnfufqy,Heres my neverfail recipe for stovetop popcorn unfortunately this one uses oil but still not a huge amount better than microwave or cinema popcorn. Remember the key to making good popcorn is to get them all to pop at the same time otherwise youre just burning popped corns. In a saucepan over medium heat add enough oil to coat the whole bottom in a thin layer swish it around. Use a high smoke point oil. Pour in enough kernels to make a single layer all over the bottom or very slightly more. Edit obviously put the lid on The most important step Once you start to hear a few scattered pops say one every  seconds take the pot off the heat and start a  minute timer. This allows the kernels to all reach the same temperature so theyll all pop in a shorter time when it goes back on. Swish or shake them around a bit during the  minute. Put them back on the stove at full heat if youre using an electric stove it might help to have a different hob preheated because they take forever. Gas just crank it. Shake the pot occasionally as you go  hold the lid on with a towel draped across the top. Once the popping slows  as soon as you can hear one second of silence between pops  take it off the heat and give it a shake. A few more will continue to pop afterwards. Dont push your luck! Popcorn is cheap no point ruining a batch to get the last  kernels. Add salt or whatever you like.,EatCheapAndHealthy,cng1gm5,7,t5_2vvpi

My grocery store was an illustrative example but the point stands regardless of any grocery stores practices.Now whether you care about the taste enough to discriminate is another issue entirely. Some people like me strongly dislike the taste of stored apples. Others might not notice or mind at all.

3069928,0,t3_2vbf4n,My former roommates yearold bachelors are in the same boat. When I lived with them I did  of the meal planning and cooking. Since I have moved out the guy who moved into my room has called me to ask for advice because the other two literally buy about ten frozen pizzas a week and thats just what they eat. So Ill tell you some of what I told him. Learn how to buy groceries instead of just buying food. The difference is in the longterm potential of the stuff you stock at home. If I buy  frozen meals some mac and cheese some ramen...thats one meal each. Thats buying food. Alternately if I buy a bulk amount of pasta or rice canned or frozen vegetables bread unprepared meat  thats all stuff that can be combined in endless ways to create different meals and will last a lot longer. .  Sit down and think about what you know how to make and start there. If your current skill level is tuna salad buy enough ingredients to make a large batch stick it in a tupperware and theres your work lunch for the week. It takes  seconds to slap tuna salad on bread and wrap it up for work. Get a bag of chips or better yet some fruit like apples or Cutie oranges that you can throw in a bag with the sandwich.. Do some research online for stuff like bachelor cooking or beginner cooking  find a couple of easy recipes that youd like to try pasta is usually really easy or onedish casseroles and add those ingredients to your grocery list.. Check your local sales circulars for grocery stores  they come out once a week and advertise specials and sales so you can get a lot of nonperishable food for little money. If theres a chain grocery in your town with a free membership card like Kroger King Soopers or City Market get the card and shop there. On weeks when I hit the store and get all the sales coupled with the club prices that free card saves me  or  off a  grocery bill and a lot of the things I buy will last weeks or even a month.. Some things you just always want to have on hand. The absolute barebones staples I recommend for anyone and everyone to add filler and flavor to basically every easy dish      Rice. Buy in bulk use a little at a time as a side dish in casseroles fried rice etc. It cooks quickly and fills you up.      Your favorite vegetables in frozen or canned form. I go through several cans of black beans a week because I eat them with eggs for breakfast or use them in quesadillas etc. I also always have some frozen broccoli on hand because if my meal lacks a veggie component I can dump a handful of frozen broccoli in a skillet with some olive oil salt and pepper and its done in  minutes.      Garlic and onions  assuming you like them they go in everything. Im a firm believer that theres no such thing as too much garlic in virtually any dish and onions add flavor and a little extra substance to everything from omelettes to stirfry to fajitas.      A spice rack with at least one or two options for all your preferred ethnic dishes. Cumin and chili powder for TexMex. Onion powder and red chili flakes for Asian dishes. Curry and turmeric for IndianMediterranean dishes. Paprika and garlic powder are just good allaround spices particularly for seasoning meat like burgers and chicken.I hope some of this is helpful! This is all advice that I gave to my friendsformer roommates and theyre doing much better now. They do all their grocery planning together and each of them picks a challenge dish theyve never made before and cooks for the household once a week. Its definitely a work in progress but anybody can develop these skills with some determination and the rest just comes with experience. Good luck!,EatCheapAndHealthy,cog70mw,119,t5_2vvpi

It comes out in urine as well btw on mobile but I found both the info you mentioned and what I mentioned in a WebMD article.Like I said if you have heath issues its not recommend to eat high protein because it can exacerbate issues so if you have kidney issues its probably a bad idea for example. I may very well have other heath implications. But unless youre eating a very high calorie diet which would drive up your protein intake if you used the same percentage ratios some excess protein isnt likely to be terribly harmful.With  calories per gram of protein thats  calories per day from protein in a  calorie per day diet but a lot of food supplies protein besides just meat so thats not terribly hard to hit. ,EatCheapAndHealthy,cql8hjc,1,t5_2vvpi

4261640,0,t3_39sant,I wasnt  a single person household but I hope my experiences give some insight  I had a CSA when I first moved in with my partner. We got the couples box and it was quite a lot food to go through. and very often we had to be experimental to use it up  which can be a source of stress if youre not used to cooking or just want to eat something simplenot surprising.Its also annoying when something is in season and you get it every week and it seems like its never going to end  and you dont actually like it. In my case it was cantaloupes. We ended up with a cantaloupe every week for  weeks and I had no idea what to make and the first two went bad  I finally found a recipe for a tea bread and made that and some muffins.I will mention that we were using a very small fridge with a freezer section and would often run out of room for storing. Sometimes its fun to research new items and figuring out how to cook them but sometimes its a PITA and the very last thing you want to do after getting home from work. I think meal planning the day you get the box would be a good way to get around that. I wish I had known about meal planning back then. If you really want to go ahead see if you can find a CSA that is tailorable if you can choose more fruit than veg for example and try it for a  week run. Keep an eye on the produce and if it starts to look like youre not going to get through it work out something with a friendfamilyco worker. Ive taken bunches of lemons and apples to work and left them in the breakroom for people to help themselves when inundated with freebies from family. ,EatCheapAndHealthy,cs607k3,7,t5_2vvpi

That included the black peppercorn he got from Trader Joes or some shit.When the pepper grinder at my dads job ran out he refilled it with some of the pepper weve got which is just some cheap McCormick peppercorns.Boss couldnt even tell the difference.Those fancy peppercorns like the pink ones which arent technically pepper I believe theyre actually dried berries therell be some differences. But really its not that big of a difference. Just stick with the cheap stuff its still just as good and a lot less on your wallet. Making delicious food isnt all about what you put into the food its how you use the ingredients at your disposal and whats around you.I can tell you that Ive made some fancy ass shit. As an example I took raspberries and turned them into a char siu that red Chinese BBQ sauce like youd get with pork fried rice. It was good I got to admit and I enjoyed it with my chickpeas and freekeh fried rice heres the recipe btw But...Ive also made simple stuff like pizza dough and falafel and honestly those have been better in my opinion.TLDR Nah youre not really missing out. Your food will still be just as flavourful with the cheap spices. Just use the spices well.The only exception Id give is grinding your own spices. You will get more flavourful spices if youre grinding them yourself. Be that black pepper or cumin seeds.,EatCheapAndHealthy,csgtuga,4,t5_2vvpi

4593568,0,t3_3dxgyz,Breakfast I like making a bunch of hard boiled eggs that I grab on the way out the door in the morning and eat on the way to work but Ive left them in the fridge at work too and it works fine. I leave a box of cereal and a box of oatmeal at my desk and a box of almond milk in the fridge. I just added a bag of chia seeds to my desk drawer to add to my oatmeal.  SnacksI also used to leave a block of good cheese at work and a knife.  Id get some grapes at some point during the week and eat some cheese and grapes in the afternoon.  I felt very civilized. I have natural peanut butter in the fridge which I eat with apples put into oatmeal or can use for lunch in a pinch. I go to trader joes regularly and pick up some healthyish snacks like nuts baked peas whatever i see and keep them in my desk for afternoon snacks. Lunch I like a good salad for lunch no heating required.  You can find lots of recipes for mason jar salads online if you are ok with prepping ahead of time.  I so invested in a bento box which made me eat better at work I think.  When I make a healthy meal for dinner leftovers go into the bottom this works if you have a microwave or dont mind room temp food.

Just about the only kind of diet you dont get that much protein from is a  fruit diet oh and friedfast foods.  Vegetables typically give you  protein and grains are less but still more than sufficient.  So as long as you arent starving yourself you are almost certainly getting enough protein without even trying.  You need to worry far more about getting sufficient vitamins and other nutrients making a plantbased diet much more likely to fulfill health needs than one high on animal products.Heres a pretty good description though there are plenty of other sources only a web search away ,EatCheapAndHealthy,ctukwiy,1,t5_2vvpi

4911498,0,t3_3i5mdn,Im a uni student and sorta in the same boat but congratulations on the twins! Is there a farmers market near you? I found that if i woke up early on a satsun the stuff at the farmers market is a fraction of the price of what you would find in big supermarkets they sell all sorts of things at my local farmers market from meat veges and spices. For a while i was living on burritoes which i cooked in bulk and heated up whenever i was hungry. For  burritoes i would have a kg of ground porkbeef boiled beans in the can garlic and onion cumin and paprika to spice mixed into a thick paste and rolled into a tortilla. Also maybe invest in a toasted sandwhich maker? You can make all sorts of things with it toasties quesadillas etc. Another thing you could probably do is one pot pasta all you need is stock pasta vegetables of your choosing that can be boiled e.g. corncarrots and a can of diced tomatoes. Stick it all in and stir occasionally. If you want your pasta to be a little creamy just add some cheese the cream cheese but processed cheese works ok as well. One more thing i learnt that i found came in handy was how to make batter for chicken nuggets or vegetable nuggets. Just combine bread crumbs which cost next to nothing from the bakery some salt sugar and spices my personal favourite is paprika and dip them into an egg wash and back out again. Once youre done pop it in a zip loc bag and youre good for snacks for the kids for the week! There are always healthier and cheaper options but when you first start out cooking it can be expensive to get all the basics together but totally worth it in the long run.

SOMETIMES Ill add a squeeze of honey but not usually. Anyway  by the time I eat it about two hours after I arrive at work it is perfect.  I walk to work so this kind of calorie boost at that time is kind of useful. cup of fatfree yogurt and  cup of frozen berries is very filling and very very lowcal!

I freeze the meat portion and pack that tight with the dressing in a small insulated pack.  I dont keep the plain chopped veg  cold.  I walk to work so weight is a consideration.Another trick I found  I adore ham amp pea salad.  Ive prepped the ingredients used frozen peas and frozen cubed ham and frozen cubed cheese.  Mix them up without the mayo  put it in a thermos.  Then at snack time add the mayor or mayovinegarsugar... and by the time lunch rolls around its perfect.

As you said if you cook for yourself and dont eat a lot of processed foods its not hard to stay at a reasonable level but its amazing how easy it is to think youre eating relatively healthy in terms of calories etc. and be WAY over on sodium if you rely on a lot of processed food.

Take your washed tomatoes and halve them then third them so you should have  roughly equal pieces. Add the olive oil to a mediumsmall sauce pan then add your tomatoes on top setting the heat to about  and put a lid on. We want the oil to get hot and eventually our tomatoes are going to dissolve into a nice saucy consistency. Keep an eye on them and stir them about every  minutes so they dont burn. Dice your onions and stir them into your tomatoes. After about  minutes we should be at a nice simmer and things should be getting liquidy. Chop up your broccoli or kale and add that shit in. Add your chia too. The chia is going to absorb some liquid and thicken up your sauce. If you want add A LITTLE bit of water to your choosing to dethinken it a little bit. Season as you wish at this point and just keep stirring it periodically until your pasta is done. Combine and enjoy!Chia is cool because it adds fiber and protein but also can add a new change in texture.

6954517,0,t3_4aymr9,I like to make a fennel slaw. You can make it with any type of dressing you like just cut the stalks off the top stand it up on the core and cut it in half. Put it flat on your cutting board and slice off and discard the exposed discolored part. Then you can use a mandolin and it slice very thin or do it by hand with a knife.My favorite dressing to add is Annies mango fat free vinaigrette but you can dress it with a homemade vinaigrette or just some citrus and olive oil. Its really refreshing and good for your digestion and theres no cooking involved!You can make slaws out of all kinds of veggies besides cabbage and play around with what you put on them. You can even mix veggies add dried and fresh fruits nuts canned beans etc. Its an easy way to add an extra vegetable side dish without a lot of work.Edit Here are  slaw recipes from the food network. You dont have to get fancy. Just pick the veggies you like chop or slice them thinly and add some kind of dressing.,EatCheapAndHealthy,d14mlo5,5,t5_2vvpi

6971001,0,t3_4b53qz,Really use any slow cooker recipe. Add in less liquid cook for less time. If the slow cooker recipe says cook  hrs on low thats about an hour at pressure in the pressure cooker.  hours in a slow cooker is maybe  min in a pressure. Favorite recipe right nowSeason a beef roast chuck shoulder sirloin whatever liberally with fajita seasoning and start browning in the pressure cooker in some olive oil. Meanwhile roughly chop onions throw in with the beef and flip if its browned. Chop sweet potatoes throw in the pot. Dump in a bag of baby carrots add about a tsp more fajita seasoning a cup of beef or veggie stock stir cook at pressure for  hr. Delicious. Another tip You can seriously cook a whole package of frozen chicken as long as the block fits in the pressure cooker. Dump in about a cup of chicken stock season it and cook for an hour. Chicken comes out perfect. Drop some whole red potatoes on top of the frozen chicken block and mash them separately when the hour is up easy side. ,EatCheapAndHealthy,d16i0ld,2,t5_2vvpi

7944409,0,t3_4o2im4,I sometimes do a split meal prep where I shop on Sunday cook meals for MonWed and then prep some more meals on Wed for ThursSat.  Typically Sundays I eat dinner with the family parents and siblingsethnic tradition and scrounge from my grocery haul for lunch.  This helps break up the monotony some.  I also should say that a lot of meal prep I see is this ultra boring combo of rice chicken broccoli or sweet potato ground beef and broccoli.  You can meet the same macro nutrient combos with much more exciting food like curries or pastas.Another idea Ive seen is not meal prepping so much as ingredient prepping where you wash and cut ingredients and selectively cook ingredients dried beanscauliflower ricemeat to combine during the week in various recipes.  Example would be grilling chicken breast cleaning and chopping broccoli peppers greens and scallions.  Then one night doing chicken fajita tacos and another night doing a pasta with chicken sun dried tomatoes and veg and another night doing a big salad with chicken and a simple vinaigrette.  This takes more cooking but is still more convenient because youve eliminated a lot of prep work.

In fact theres an entire branch of occupational therapy that is dedicated to getting adults and children conditioned to handling various tastes and textures. My understanding is that it is more common among preemies who were tube fed for long period of time but there can be other causes as well.The person who recommended slowly acclimating with your self had some great ideas. Another suggestion is to add a small amount of a food that bothers you to your plate with each meal. Make sure the rest of the meal contains food you enjoy then depending on how bad your reversion is set goals. I know some people are so averse to certain foods that they have a hard time just having that food on your plate. I know that for kids some of the goals are smell the food touch the food with your tongue place a small amount of food in your mouth for a few seconds without swallowing doing the same and then swallowing the food.

8231629,0,t3_4s0600,I dont really have any specific recipes but I can give some general suggestions.Frozen veggies are fine. In fact theyre generally better than fresh veggies from a supermarket. Flashfreezing locks in nutrients that would otherwise degrade while theyre sitting around in the store and you can keep them in your freezer for a crazy long time without them going bad.You definitely need to branch out into different vegetables. It can be intimidating if youre only used to like three things but it can be fun too! My fiance and I have recently been buying fruits and veggies that we dont recognize and Googling them when we get home to find out how the heck to prepare them. Its resulted in some culinary adventures that I would have missed out on if I let some weird looking root thing scare me away.I see that you already tend to have chicken in the house which is great because chicken is relatively healthy and super versatile. Just Google something like Easy chicken recipes and pick something that looks good!Spices are going to be your new best friends. Garlic powder is great in most dishes avoid garlic salt it adds unnecessary sodium lemon pepper is great for fish or chicken oregano is a musthave for any kind of pasta and savory combination spices just look for something labeled as such really bring out the flavor of red meat. I also always have some kind of hot spice like chili powder to add a kick to certain dishes.In regards to the backstory...gtDaniel wont eat that at all...This stood out to me. What the hell kind of parental logic is that? Ill bet most kids wouldnt enjoy getting a cast doesnt mean that parents should just let their kids limp around on broken untreated limbs if the kid doesnt want to go to a doctor. They have a responsibility to provide a safe home for you and your brother and by limiting the household diet and caving to his spoiled tastes theyre condemning you both to weight struggles and health problems.

A small handful of red pepper flakes or a squirt of harissa adds interest too.You can also blend or finely mince some sundried tomatoes in oil add some sliced olives walnuts and salt and create a tasty red pesto.If you live near a German or eastern European deli theyll undoubtedly carry ajvar which is a yummy pestolike vegetable spread mostly sweet red pepper and eggplant. It makes a good noncheesy base for a cooked vegetable pasta. And hey!

9020168,0,t1_d7vbo4e,The best easiest way to prepare vegetables is to roast them. Zucchini yellow squash bell peppers broccoli are widely available and relatively cheap. All you need to prepare them is a sheet pan maybe some nonstick aluminum foil for less clean up a knife to cut your veggies and a surface to cut them on. Cut all your vegetables up into rough cubes. They dont have to be perfect or uniform but try to get them close to the same size. Dump into a bowl glug in some cooking oil  grapeseed canola olive  and seasonings. You cant go wrong with salt pepper and garlic powder but experiment with what you like. Mix it all up until everything is coated in the oil and seasoning. Dump out onto your sheet pan. Throw in a  degree oven and let it go. Check it after about  minutes and mix everything up again so that every side of the veggies will get that nice roastiness. Take them out when the veggies are browned to your liking. Roasted vegetables will go with almost anything. Use them as a side dish for meat or sandwiches or wraps. Throw them in with cooked pasta and a vinaigrette for pasta salad. Throw them in cold to a regular salad. Put them in a burrito. The possibilities are endless. ,EatCheapAndHealthy,d7w2zst,2,t5_2vvpi

Normally this oil is quite a bit more expensive when purchased in the small bottles so the oz can is much cheaper per oz.   You may be able to find this is local restaurant supply stores like Smart amp Final for cheaper same with Tahini.

I think the cabbage idea is great  you can keep changing it up and make things that would align more to his palate  blaukraut is easy to make at home especially in a slow cooker. Ive also had luck with making pasta sauces from squash  butternut and acorn  by roasting the squash and blending it with chicken stock and Parmesan.

Add  or  tbsp this is about g fiber g fat g protein to some yogurt the night before. In the morning theyll have increased in volume really it only takes mins but I never can wait that long for breakfast. Fills you up really well. You can also add  or  tbsp peanut butter and tbsp cocoa powder to the yogurt makes it into a really thick dense yogurt and tastes awesome. Anyway yeah carbohydrates will make you hungry much more quickly. If you want to test this compare your hunger levels when you wake up after eating a bunch of sweetssugar the night before. Guaranteed youll feel hungrier in the morning after snacking on chocolate and cookies at night. As a general rule protein makes you feel full and fat keeps you fuller for longer slower to digest. Look for foods that are higher in fat and protein and lower in carbs except fiber you cant digest it anyway but it helps to stay full and this should fix your problem. ,EatCheapAndHealthy,da5xqjt,16,t5_2vvpi

11355563,0,t3_61zxip,A good rule is to get a plate fill  with a protein  with a whole grain and  with vegetables and fruits.  This will most likely constitute a healthy meal.  But of course a plate of bacon macaroni and cheese and french fries is far from as good as a plate of salmon wild rice and spinach.  So common sense still applies of course.As vegetables and fruits go eh walk in to any grocery and youll see onions lettuce tomatoes etc are all quite common.  But what does it matter whats common?  Eating a wide variety of vegetables is what you should strive for.  That said on my end some combination of onions carrots garlic celery peppers and ginger form the basis for a whole lot of dishes I make.  Not necessarily all at once mind you.  For example ginger garlic onions and celery just went in to an Asian influenced slaw I just made.Whats the best for you?  Dark green vegetables are very good for you.  Berries are quite good for you.  But heck potatoes are quite good for you if you cook them in a healthy manner and dont over do it.Proteinwise nuts seeds beans and whole grains are going to be good sources if youre not eating meat.  And again variety is good for you.  So various nuts lentils peas various beans brown rice quinoa whole wheat bulgur wheat oats corn barley flax seeds bean sprouts etc would all be things to go with.Id also urge you to go with seafood though.  Seafood is one of the healthiest sources of protein there is.And Id also recommend not being shy about olive oil used in moderation of course.,EatCheapAndHealthy,dfj4rnn,3,t5_2vvpi
