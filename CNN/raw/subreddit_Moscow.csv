4006372,0,t1_crcvit1,As a person who recently traveled to Kazan by train my advice to you is to take a plane. Russian trains for the most part is only good for nostalgia. It costs the same to fly on the plane and the trip is going to be  hours shorter. There is probably not going to be an electrical outlet near you in the train and the one that you actually going to find will be right next to a pissfilled bathroom. And you dont need me to tell you about the stench. If you are lucky enough to get a ticket for a top bunk bed prepare yourself for just lying there for  hours without being able to sit upalthough it depends on the type of a train. Also if you feel a little bit dangerous better accept the constant proposals from your already drunk trainneighbors to drink some vodka.Seriously fly by a plane. Get there faster have more time to see this beautiful city.Also dont go to First National Restaurant in Kazan its expensive as fuck and pointless regarding the local cuisine. Go to House of Tea right in front of First National Restaurant and fill your belly with glorious Tatar food for about  rublesyeah it is super cheap there.,Moscow,crcyght,1,t5_2rhfo
4496444,0,t1_csxdn72,Only problem is that the metro closes up at am so they will still need to grab a cab from the train station. Itd probably make sense to crab the cab and give the driver some extra cash to give you a scenic tour. Get out in the centre have wonder around red square and then at  the metro gets going go the the train station and catch the aeroexpress back. They depart every  min from  onwards. Should be back at the airport by am with plenty of time to check in. i guess the time you get to the airport depends on how adventurous you want to be ,Moscow,csxfm84,2,t5_2rhfo

If anyone is gonna steal your phone its going to be when you are not looking so always watch your possesions kind of a general advice. S is a wonderful phone and will get you a ton cool pictures to remember your trip by so I say go for it. ,Moscow,d5iffzo,1,t5_2rhfo

While youre still a student you dont have to get any extra permits to work on campus also some universities pay students for publishing research papers so ask your professors if you can help with some research or commercial project. To work outside of campus while you are still a student you need to apply for a permit after you get a job offer it is not problematic for the employer but most employers have no idea about it so you might have to explain the law to them. After graduation its not a big problem either. Consult with this page  and email them for specific questions.,Moscow,d88g1nw,3,t5_2rhfo
10020017,0,t3_5j0i3m,If you are certain you can freely leave the airport you have a few options you can use an aeroexperss train instead of the bus  it is around  rur but it has fixed time of arrival starts from places relatively near to city centre and can come in eticket or any other form? which is awesome tho qrcode on a phone screen sometimes lag better print that guy and buy online. There is a designated aeroexpress line for any of the airports. depending on a day you can visit tons of prenny fine bars and such many of those work late hours some are  lots of things work at night e.g. many food stores and such which is awesome tons of public transport stop working at night tho we have some nightly bus routes around centre and such if you have a smartphone absolutely download some taxi apps uber yandex taxi and a map. it may be pretty cold depending on your gear so plan ahead. Tons of stuff is illuminated at night and all that but it can be a burden to walk all around on foot trying to find something. note that almost any place even most small convinience stores accept any cards we rarely have all that we accept only such and such card types craze. arriving at  almost totally ensures that the museums gonna be closed so better search for the timetables most of the grand ones have those in english.,Moscow,dbdmwxt,5,t5_2rhfo

10885771,0,t1_de2pguf,In BB Id like to look at starting to import goods outside of the main local dealer networks established in Russia. This will become a very large and important part of the economy as more and more consumer goods areas are allowed to parallel trade. This means you could be buying a new BMW either from an exclusive BMW agent as is the case today or an independent car supermarket for example that sells a mix of car makes. The benefits of this are vast for the consumer particularly on preventing price fixing. Germany insists a  of all medicines sold in pharmacies is bought outside of the local main agents specifically to prevent price fixing in fact. It will lower prices across the board in Russia.
