4801108,0,t1_ctzled7,gt I also dont get your and izzys reaction to implementing some more structure for those that wanted it again no one had intentions of forcing anything on someone who didnt want it.  Whatever reaction youre talking about is a figment of someones imagination.  There isnt even a little bit of truth to that.  I was all for it.  I said it worked well repeatedly here and in chat.  For example this comment from three days ago.,harmonclan,ctzpwrw,1,t5_349xh

6800066,0,t1_d0mxg6p,Not here to stir anything up but to clear things up. Im Levi and Ill try to let you know what I know. Im gonna be hard on myself too.Yeah I do a lot of talking about our Harmonclans but I wouldnt call it complaining. There are some frustrations vented sure but the crux of everything Ive said on Reddit Line and clan chat about this has been to reconcile things. Thats what I want. Its not attention seeking divaish or negative. Maybe Im weird but Id consider it constructive criticism. There was a lot that went down after DemoteGate and though I tried to help I ended up failing. But I keep on trying. Well at least every time it comes up. Cause it is draining doing this but Id rather spend my energy on getting things fixed and the truth out there. I get your anger too. Ive been there. And youre right it wasnt transphobic but I get the insult still the same. Its truly not how I am. Im happy with however things want to be. If everyone wants the two clans to be seperate cool. If everyone wants to be able to go back and forth freely cool. Insert third situation but the point is I just want people to be happy. Or at least not angry at me. I just want to make people feel better and I dont really care what it costs me. Maybe thats the equivalent of my  pony but Im gonna keep trying to earn it even after I fail because thats how I was raised and feel it needs to be done. That was the point of me trying to go over to your clan. It seemed like a good time to try and apologize. Brandon who caused the second clan to be created in the first place with DemoteGate could go over why couldnt I? Id just been on the podcast so I was hoping people might like me a little more or be more open to me. Rob even said I shouldnt but I still wanted to try. Why not? Whats wrong with working towards a solution? Like I said its fair to call me someone whining about a pony. I had just hoped that I was earning it instead and could use the pony for everyone. As for ignorant rude mean and a drama queen Ive got to disagree. I cant ignore other people because I care more about other people than myself. Hopefully my reply has shown you that I am neither rude nor mean autistically unaware I would buy. And I leave my drama for the stage and screen. This stuff takes a toll on me emotionally. So I only really want to comment in order to clear up miscommunications or to move the group reconciliation forward. Like how I would say now that I have had counseling and therapy both forced  and by choice. It actually helped a lot except the forced times. No  year old should be forced into therapy for not talking a lot and I only stopped going when my last therapist recommended I should. Its not meant as a dig but more to show you that I have the mentalemotional tools and am more welladjusted than it seems to most.Kaitlin wasnt defending me either or trying to enable me. Id posted in clan chat after getting rejected about how sad it was went to sleep and woke up to all of this. She took it on herself to say what she said. I almost wish she hadnt but the more I read her post the more I think she just needed to get it out any way possible. Really this whole thing needs to get done and out in the open. And this whole idea that people arent allowed or its badtaboowrong to say anything negativedramaishangry because its a public forum is counterintuitive to the entire idea of a free open discussion. Passion doesnt always equal crazy. You also dont have to read it so we arent forceably bringing you into anything. If its not your cup of tea I get it. But you are going out of your way to hurt people now. So you have brought us into your pain. But again I dont have to read it or respond so Im being hypocritical there too. I cant speak for Kaitlin too but it seems this has helped spur some discussion with H more members from H coming to H I only use the numbers arbitrarily not as denotion of worth and Im always happy to see the woman I love express herself. Especially when its passionately upset. I dont see it very often so I guess I get a little glee from reading her posts. Whether I agree with them or not. So who knows maybe youre right and were narcissistically feeding into each other. If you were watching how much it made her sad all day you wouldnt think that. Hell she didnt even check her phone most of the day thinking not much had come from it. Ive been doing everything I can to help her forget it and just generally make her feel better. I guess the conclusion is that you might be working on bad information. I know the people Ive insultedoffendedhurt at Harmontown. Before the split I never had anything but pleasant talk with all but one clan member DawkinsDylan who was always harassing me to do things differently in game. I accidentally insulted Chris in the Line chat after the split and while apologizingexplaining was booted from the chat entirely. Then I tried talking with Rob to no avail. So when he tried recruiting I got mad and asked why he didnt try to talk things out and improve things before hand. It seemed like recruiting for two halves of a whole clan was a hollow gesture. It seemed better to get people on both sides talking and moving from clan to clan for optimal war and space usage rather than adding new people to an already crazy bunch. I still stand by that. Its part of why I wanted to visit your clan. Maybe do a war with you donate some max drags and show you that bygones are bygones. Theres always people left out in wars too so it seemed better to balance the group and keep everyone included. I dont like exclusion. For anyone. For as much shit as Adam Goldberg and I have gone through I would never want him excluded from Harmontown. It takes a lot of energy to hate someone so why do it? Get angry yeah. But grudges dont do anyone any good. I dont know Im just trying to help here.,harmonclan,d0n2wh8,-2,t5_349xh
