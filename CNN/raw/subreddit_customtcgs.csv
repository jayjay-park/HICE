7708742,0,t3_4kvo0z,More advanced rulesSome warriors have abilities which can be activated. These abilities have turn counters and some will cost degrees. Whenever a warrior activates it ability it may not attack next combat phase. It can also use its ability in place of its attack during the combat phase. Some warriors have secondary effects which always are active. Special Combat RulesAttack Boost When attacking you can exhaust a warrior adjacent to an attacking one to boost its attack. The new attack value is simply the attackers attack plus the boosters attack. When a warrior boosts instead of recharging from exhaustion next turn it will not recharge until the next turn. Rule states that any exhausted warriors are recharged next turnBlock Assist When one of your warriors is attacked you may use an adjacent warrior as long as it is not exhausted to take the damage without return. Unlike an attack boost the blocker will not exhaust if it survives the attack. Instead the warrior will have  less attack next combat phase this effect cannot be circumvented by any cards. Sidestep If a warrior is being attacked you can move out of the way. If there is an open zone adjacent to the warrior the warrior may move there to avoid the damage at a cost of  degrees during your next turn. If the warrior sidesteps into another attacker it will take damage from that attacker. ,customtcgs,d3ifkru,1,t5_3cfvp
