New server just rush a  character to  and you will be one of the top players in the server or you can just throw your wallet at the game intends you to do. If you think stats mean anything at all then you are playing the wrong game I promise you stats or strategy are irrelevant in this game which is why not matter what you tweak or how much you grind someone with a big wallet can start  days after you did and surpass you in minutes without putting too much thought into stats or formation.,DArrancar,d7jib5y,1,t5_3g6rp
