3576827,0,t1_cpzyzou,Thank you for responding.How do you like the Pi? I started looking into them after I posted thinking along similar lines.I know a bit of unix but am not hard core. I did some admin work a hundred years ago but would never call myself a sysadmin. Is Pi easy enough to set up given some background in unix?What other things are you doing with Pi?,myweatherstation,cpzzi4g,1,t5_2xk03
4565726,0,t1_ct63uo1,Yeah it makes me wonder about the accuracy of everyday indooroutdoor sensors.  I mean even if theyre within a degree or two of the actual temperature theyre in there are so many variables  sunlight wind temperature of surfaces near the sensors etc.I look at the Wundermap with the weather stations and you can get a pretty good idea based on seeing a bunch of weather stations.,myweatherstation,ct64h7h,1,t5_2xk03
