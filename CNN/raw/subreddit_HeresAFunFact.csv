Dude was just being creative and having fun in his own way. In Toy Story  he is a young guy with a good blue collar job that will pay well. I think Pixar have him a decent ending he looked happy.,HeresAFunFact,cn88n7g,9,t5_35dnd

If you were a royal then I would certainly be worried. Some people are richer than others. Its a fact of life. Even as a  year old I can see that you are acting like some sort of angst spoilt teenager not a supposed successful  year old with plenty of life experience.,HeresAFunFact,cngvs5o,0,t5_35dnd

3774055,0,t1_cqmglld,Jaguars have been living alongside the caiman for a very long time. It would make sense that those who are better at going for the kill spot are more successful at killing prey and then reproducing. The jaguars who are not very good at this are likely to become injured or even killed by the caiman and then wont be reproducing to pass along their lessthanadequate caiman hunting genes.

6556935,0,t1_czvmj92,The bats you pictures are Egyptian Fruit Bats which werent the subject of the study and do not exhibit the same alcohol tolerance. They mentioned it in the discussion of the paper you linked to which one of my favorites that the lead author had tried it with those bats and they failed to navigate the maze as well! Unfortunately those results werent published when this paper came out in . Thatd be an interesting follow up paper for sure. The South American bats tested seem to encounter more greatly fermented food which explains the development of greater tolerance. Heres a picture of one of the bat species tested drinking from a syringe of what is probably sugar water You should cross post your video to rbatty and rsciencefacts!,HeresAFunFact,czxjhg5,2,t5_35dnd
