8990052,0,t1_d7s1pw7,gtI didnt really care about Hedwig.But but owl! She died! She was Harrys first real friend she was his only connection to the wizarding world and Sirius during those long summer months and and and.....  Actually your choice of worst death being Lily and James makes me think back on the other young parents of the series like Merope or Frank and Alice Longbottom. For some reason I dont feel bad about James and Lily dying. That was essential for the plot. But did Frank and Alice have to be tortured to the point where death would be preferable? And poor Merope never loved by anyone. Not her family not her son and certainly not the man she bewitched.,DailyChat,d7sgs7a,1,t5_3fm0z

10113337,0,t3_5kqakm,Flair!I used to work at TGI Fridays and they had practice bottles there so now if Im at a party and the wine runs down in a bottle or two. I grab them up and do bartender flair tricks! As an alternative I also let people punch me in the stomach. There always really nervous to do so but it doesnt hurt at all. Good times all around.,DailyChat,dbprz1d,3,t5_3fm0z

11438619,0,t3_63akl6,I think the longest I was awake was when I came back from Beijing. I was determined not to fall asleep on any of the flights so I could adjust to regular time quicker. But once I go past h awake I really cant keep track any longer or I start blacking out. So  hours? Maybe?,DailyChat,dfsk1rp,3,t5_3fm0z
