1187487,0,t3_27p1xx,When I PMOd Id hate my smile and find nothing to smile about. But now that I dont I like my smile and have things to smile for.Edit I almost forgot to share something intriguing. I was in my friends art class dropping by today I usually visit him a lot so most of the people in the class were used to seeing me there. There we were talking about stuff then the subject of dances was brought up. The freshmen My friend is one Im a junior were talking about their semiformal that happened. My friend said he didnt go so some of the girls Who are his friends and are starting to be my friends too were a little surprised asking why then the talking continued. Then one of the freshmen girls asked me if I went and I said yes but I didnt really care. She also asked if I went to Prom For most schools its senior year but for ours it is  junior and I said I didnt go. So she was surprised by that..then she added in she wouldnt have minded going with me. Of course when I thought about that statement at the time I didnt really notice because we moved on to another topic and it was quick but now that I think about it..I keep wondering if Im recalling this previous scenario wrong like I skipped a detail or something..but...given my attitude and my dark past..some statement like this was..supposed to be impossible..and yet..The girl I think is oklooking But she also is two years younger than me so I have to be careful and not think maturely and shes nice so I guess I dont sense any serious potential. I have..a weird sense of beauty. I think make up is revolting. Its..I dont even know a girl can be big but I can find her attractive some big women I find good other not so and same goes for skinny as well as races etc. and she is also young but I think she is a lot more pretty than most girls in the school whom guys think are pretty and who girls are jealous of But shouldnt be....but so far in my life compared to everything and everyone else she was the first girl who I know for a fact said that she wouldnt have minded going to a dance. With me. Compared to every other ranting guy who thinks of himself as forever alone I was below the bottom of the barrel and here I am now reaching a point in my life where that may change. This is monumental.Given I wrote this much about that one detail it probably doesnt mean much. A lot of bitterness has happened but so has a lot of growth over a certain detail. Quitting porn did not mean that some beautiful woman would be my reward for the hard effort. No..that was what caused me a lot of turmoil..because that damn statement was true for so many other men who took on the pornfreeNoFap challenge and not once was it me! But..I have also learned just because it was not a guaranteed reward my willpower and resilience to resist porn has become probably the strongest Ive known compared to anyone else and I have learned and received the benefits of being off porn whether I was addicted or not. I have made quitting porn my motivation for myself I do not require or need the assistance or support of some woman to do this solely for. It makes me think..maybe one day when Im older than I am now..well that kind of thinking has caused me too much confusion and disappointment in the past so hopefully I can continue to make sure I stay focused on the Present instead of the Future or I might else lose both.,ValhallaChallenge,ci37lw8,2,t5_2vrji

1423581,0,t3_2afq9v,Checking in.  Feeling very lonely today.  Gotta keep going.  Last night I went blues dancing for the first time.  I sucked.  REALLY badly.  I hate learning new dances.  Give me a few months and then it wont be so bad.  Right now Im learning that ever  though some things are painful and hard they still deserve a chance.  Ive learned this lesson in many other aspects of my life but its a process.  In answer to the question  people have someone to react to!  I used to fade into the far corner of any conversation or social interaction.  I hated being around other people.  Now I show my personality and it seems that folks like who I am.  People want to be around me.  Its nice.  But things are far from easy.  I have so much work ahead of me.  So much ground still yet to cover.  I want so much for myself.  I want to be excellent.  I want to be healthy.  I want to be kind.  I want to hopeful.  I want to be honest.  I want to be wise.  I want to be frugal.  I want to be a hard worker.  I want to be physically impressive.  I want all of this and more.  I am so far from who I want to be.  But Im willing to make the distance.  Its hard.  In the mean time I know that woman like me as a friend.  I know that everyone says Im such a wonderful person.  I dont just want to be wonderful.  I want to be captivating.  I am willing to put in the work.  I am eating around . thousand calories every day working out  times every week dancing twice every week and approaching women.  I am practicing humility and honesty with my friends.  Trying to make others feel special instead of just caring for myself.  I am on a budget which I stay carefully considerate towards.  And I know this will all pay off.  Someday in a few years I will look back on this time and say Self thank you for putting in the work to get to where you are today.  But Im not there yet.  Someday soon.

I have to take responsibility and if I start to creep into I was tired or I felt overwhelmed by work those may both be true but neither are healthy and both push blame away.

3609002,0,t1_cq3iy30,If you want some advice if you cant picture your grandma in those images then its pornographic enough. Its the same thing when it comes to videos when someone talks about limits or how far one asks to go in regards to this no porn challenge I think thats the proper answer. My experience those kinds of images leads to inevitable escalation. Or at the very least you still experience the negative side effects of porn anyway. One guy said he started to masturbate to pictures of bikinis and then started feeling the same adrenaline rushes And negative feelings that porn tends to bring so he knew it was a problem. I mean you can disregard what I said I dont really want to discourage shunning yourself from whats beautiful and all but for many people doing this kind of thing is just a trap to go back to porn.

4495976,0,t3_3cmxba,Lowest low was masturbating several times a day my body was aching and down there especially was in a lot of pain but not as much as the pain in my heart as I watched more and more hardcore gross shit that was just really awful which made me think I was disgusting to be aroused while not knowing what it was doing to my mind so I thought about castration or suicide or both. It was an onandoff struggle for  years I say that because when I look back it just seemed like unguided stupidity that could easily have been resolved given a few tips but they were tips no one knew to give to me nor I to myself. Only now do I know.Ive been stressed about some deeper topics lately to the point my sex drive is diminishing a bit. My passions were beginning to consume me and thats only fun if you have someone with you but if you are by yourself you just suffer. At least it ought to make the transition from my recent relapses a lot easier hopefully. I feel Ive reached something called the Porn Paradox dont know if its a paradox by definition. I dont want to look at something gross obviously but I now dont want to look up videos or images of something sexy either. Its harder to resist the later but when I think back to my last relapse looking at that last video I just stopped masturbating and stared in awe like one of those dumb fucks youd see in those movies you know those idiot men who just lose themselves and start oogling over some woman. It shouldnt make sense if I could look at something sexy I should feel happy but it just breaks me down more. Maybe Ive moved on from these harmful fantasies trying to crave something more real someone more real though that would be stupidly optimistic. Is it really worth feeling this stupid sadness? Have I really lost my interest in porn? The biggest lie porn has taught me is that a woman would ever feel any enthusiasm for me. I hold on to that fact and I feel I see the bigger truth.I really hope this is it Im sick of all these new relapses that keep happening to me.

4857410,0,t3_3hen0h,Noporn is possible but since you still fap you still get some big dopamine release which can leave you demotivated but not as much as doing it with porn. Later edit I should also remind you that you still lose a lot of the benefits of nofap and resources from your body which then has to work extra to put you back on your feet so dont do it! Nofap with porn is impossible. If I watch porn when I try to meditate learn or even concentrate on anything porn flashbacks come back and I feel the urge to look at another video and another. Ive had entire zeroproductivity days like that. Dont do it! Eventually youll fap just to get rid of the constant temptation. Its nonstop mental torture and the lowest of the lows once youre truly done.

We move in together the same day I go to army which is amazing but.. at the same time really saddening. We are in a long distance relationship already but its not the same as it will be when I am in the army and shes in our shared home all alone for weeks at a time. I am also scared that my jealousy will be like poison to us during those weeks spent in the forest digging holes into the frozen ground and that I will grow bitter. I know I can trust her but my brain just fuck me over so much. I am afraid shell seek comfort in another man which now when written down sounds really idiotic and unrealistic. Weve been through too much hardship together in  already and I wish army is not the nail to our coffin.

5932900,0,t3_3wlnp9,Ive got a new goal no erections. One of the reasons why this past week has been hard rerelapses is because I found myself getting turned on to random photos on the internet. I want to make a new goal of not pursuing any sort of sexual arousal at all for the next season of life.Obviously I would love to have sexuality in my life but for this season of healing I just dont think its possible. Next lifeseason hopefully I can have a sexually satisfying relationship with a wonderful woman.,ValhallaChallenge,cxxc0qo,1,t5_2vrji

6035491,0,t3_3y32dw,Long update comment here so bear with me just have a bit I want to write about and this community is always a great place to vent. Literally just relapsed. Not gonna let this one be a binge because fuck that. Ive been there too many times and since I cant go back to half an hour ago to stop myself from relapsing I might as well make progress with what Ive got in this exact moment. Today I celebrated Christmas even though its only Christmas eve. We went to my moms side of the family to celebrate it then came back home and opened gifts here so that we dont have to wake up super early tomorrow and we can just have Christmas day to do what we please. It was a pretty good day up until about half an hour ago when I started slipping towards relapse and then eventually made the jump straight into the fire. It sucked but Im moving on. Havent meditated in a while so I may try that tonight before going to bed. Pretty sure my relapse happened strictly out of boredom since I was waiting for black ops  to finish downloading and didnt really feel like going to bed at midnight. So right now I feel like I know why I relapsed and I know what I need to do in the future to stop it from happening again I feel a bit better prepared to tackle this problem though I would advise against relapsing even if youre trying to achieve this mindset. Not worth it at all. Also as a side note for anyone whos read my previous posts here about recently strengthening a friendship with a girl I havent texted her or anything since I think Tuesday or something. I dont see anything happening immediately but ya never know what may happen so Im just gonna push on through and try to fix myself first before going too deep with this one. Ive had way too many failures in my past and Im not about to make another decision that Im just gonna regret in a year as I look back. Theres a Buddha quote that goes something like What you are is what you have done what you will be is what you do thats poorly paraphrased but it still gets the meaning across. Im not gonna be slowed down by past actions but rather strengthened by current actions. Its my life and I dont want it to be a damn failure when I look back on it I want it to be an amazing story. Good night everyone who made it this far merry Christmas and happy holidays. ,ValhallaChallenge,cyarmx2,5,t5_2vrji
6133035,0,t1_cymkp53,I really do enjoy cycling and get quite serious in the warmer months. Its just in winter that its not really feasible. So I have to try other workouts but its hard to find something I like as much. But I will spend a few minutes at the gym to see if I can keep it up till spring. Thanks. ,ValhallaChallenge,cymrfn0,1,t5_2vrji
6145682,0,t3_3zq819,I havent made a very meaningful checkin in a long time. Part of that is because Ive been trying to substantially reduce how much I use Reddit and for a lot of last year I was very successful. I sort of let that lapse over the holidays and its time to get back on the horse. But before I do I wanted to share where Im at.Today is day  for me. Thats less than a month from my longest streak the streak that I came in to Valhalla Challenge with and ultimately went to Valhalla on. My worst temptations usually come when my wife is out of town or over the holidays and I managed to get past those in the past year. I credit a lot of that success to being fairly transparent with my wife regularly talking with an accountability partner about this and all the other goals in my life journalling meditation staying physically active and keeping routines. Ive also found the most success when Ive been hardest on my addictionnot debating whether X counts as a relapse but defaulting to the stance that if Im really on the fence its probably a relapse. That also forces you to take the long perspective that taking short term failures seriously can lead to long term success.Im redesigning my morning routine as part of my  resolutions. I typically just make breakfast change groom and walk to work but Id like to squeeze in time for  minutes of meditation and doing the days reading in my Scripture reading plan.Anyway I will make it a point to always check in with the new round at least for another five rounds or so but Ive got to fade back into the background to get my graduate degrees finished. Thanks for all your support guys.,ValhallaChallenge,cyo76tw,2,t5_2vrji
6294856,0,t1_cz3gfdx,Nothing from Potent yet. Also if you end up wanting to take over next round well wait until I make the Day  list and remove the inactive members. I think that will make it easier for the first time. And if you dont want to do next round no pressure. Just let us know at some point when youd want to do it.,ValhallaChallenge,cz55jra,2,t5_2vrji
6450435,0,t3_43znra,Scheduling therapy was the dumbest thing Ive done. Its not possible to incorporate it into my schedule so I will need to find a way to cancel any upcoming appointments.There is no cure for my grief. I cant run from it any longer. Ive been having existential depression recently. Ive also been taking a psychology class which is causing me to fall back into my negative hatred of men. Especially when well be talking about the sexual psychology.Apparently I am so drastically different from other guys psychologically which would explain how I have no appeal to many women. Im ready to die alone.,ValhallaChallenge,czmikvl,2,t5_2vrji

7208260,0,t1_d1x3y0a,Okay so a couple of things here.  While I agree we should stop masturbating I dont believe youre scum for lapsing.  Also did you fantasize while you fapped?  If no then I say thats a step in the right direction if yes then you need to reign in that.  When you have to go relieve yourself try to empty your mind of thoughts and just focus on the action actually might have trouble finishing if youre not fantasizing.  If you fap without fantasizing thats amazing seriously I cant do anything without some kind of stimulation.Remember what I said before the sin is of lusting.  The Bible doesnt say thou shalt not fap Jesus did say If you look at a woman to lust after her you have already committed adultery with her in your heart  Not that we can completely stop from sinning we cant thats actually why I need Jesus because I cant save myself so thank Him that hes washed me and made me clean.So masturbation inandof itself is not a sin.  Pastor of my old church would always say that self love requires a certain kind of mindset and I agree.  But lust is the sin.  And if youre scum for sinning than Im scum for sinning.  The funny thing is we all are.  Were despicable as humans but thank God we can turn to him.Dont let the shame of slipping hold you.  Its better to get back up and not even think about yourself.  You know thinking about yourself one way or another is selfish.  Im so bad Im scum Im evil blah blah is as bad as Im so great look at how I did this Im so good looking.  The trick is not to think of yourself at all have no self esteem and by that I mean dont think bad about yourself also dont think good about yourself.  Let your self worth come from God and other people not from yourself.Youre not doing anyone any favors thinking how bad you are.  Of course we are bad but EVERYONE is bad.  Youre not alone in that.  Im as much scum as you are.  Im a Christian and Im addicted to this crap so if there was someone more scummier than you it would be me.  Weve all fallen short weve all sinned and we all continue to sin.Women can love someone like you for the very reason youre trying to stop this.  You know its wrong and its hurting you and youre taking steps to repent.  I dont want you to get a big head but you deserve a good woman as much as the rest of us do.  If a woman cant see youre trying to improve by the simple fact that you stumble as we all do then that woman isnt worth your time.As far as being a worth while human being.  God thought you were worth his Son dying on the cross. ,ValhallaChallenge,d1xitas,2,t5_2vrji

8765869,0,t3_50471e,Went on a works night out on Saturday. Have been interested in Girl A from my work for a while now. On the night out i heard she had a boyfriend from one of the guys that started at the same time as her. Had way too much to drink and ended up hooking up with Girl B also from work. Someone who im not that interested in and i cant remember kissing her either because i blacked out and then ended up being sick a short while later. I caused a massive scene and had to be carried into a taxi. The next day in work everyone who was out the night before was laughingsmiling at me because of my antics but not Girl A. She seemed uninterested or that she was disappointed in me. Ive not seen Girl B at work yet but from the texts that have been exchanged i really dont see it going anywhere. I feel like i have thoroughly embarrassed myself and ruined any chances i had of even being friends with Girl A. I played it all off as a big joke but i really do feel like ive fucked up.Been a rough couple of weeks. ,ValhallaChallenge,d71e9o5,1,t5_2vrji

9259195,0,t3_575rnc,Checking in again another good day. Our dorm had some event to teach people how to cook in a dorm room got snapchats from a lot of people on our floor that I didnt have before our floor is getting along really well recently and its awesome. Got the snapchat of the car girl Ive been talking to gonna try to see if I cant set up something this weekend. Meeting a lot of cool people in college and on the days that I have a lot of free time Im really enjoying it. ,ValhallaChallenge,d8po4lh,1,t5_2vrji
9360817,0,t3_58ng5f,Checking in today was pretty good. Woke up this morning feeling pretty good despite having a slight cold I think sleeping in a bit helped that a lot. Hopefully tomorrow Ill still be feeling better Im going to an amusement park with friends and dont wanna be under the weather all day. Another reason that I dont want to feel like shit is because theres bound to be girls there and with the confidence Ive been feeling recently I wanna test out my approach skills. Either way it should be a fun day and a good weekend. ,ValhallaChallenge,d92jup6,1,t5_2vrji
