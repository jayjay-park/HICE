747223,0,t1_cgp7lab,I guess thats a good point. I was concerned a choke might get the flare stuck halfway up the barrel or something.  degrees cant be good. It seems the fellow in this video modified his shotgun enough to compensate for that. Or if a flare round is just like a slug round then I guess if you can shoot a slug you could shoot a flare.Definitely need to get my hands on a round and see what theyre all about. Worse comes to worse I suppose just keeping a regular flare gun around would suffice for preparedness purposes.,austinguns,cgp7rvz,2,t5_30gyk

3576251,0,t1_cpzqh51,That is one of the primary benefits of a trust. If you register an NFA item as an individual then only that individual may use the NFA item. However you can list multiple trustees on the trust all of which have the legal right to use the NFA items.For example I have a trust with my wife as the trustee. She doesnt shoot but if I was involved in a car accident while transporting an NFA item she would legally be allowed to take that NFA item home for me because she is on the trust whereas if it was registered as an individual the law gets a little grey and theoretically only the police would be able to take possession of the NFA item and even that is a little hazy IMO.,austinguns,cpzx4og,2,t5_30gyk

Now this always bothered me and is semi off topic but every time I go to the Far West HEB there is always one cop either in the parking lot or tucked just out of sight by the main entrance. It has been like this for at least  months. One time I saw two cops in the parking lot chatting which I assumed to be them changing shifts and either shooting the shit or getting the next guy up to speed. Out of every HEB in town I assumed that is probably the safest one. My only thought was maybe they are trying to deal with some theft. idk.,austinguns,cybx8nz,2,t5_30gyk

7732235,0,t1_d35s8g4,So I have had this rifle for a little while now and have put a little over  rounds through it trying to sight my scope. I havent had a single jam yet. Im not sure if it is just this particular model but it has been reliable so far. The only complaint that I have is that I cant shoot Russian steel ammo out of it. Apparently their primers are firmer than ours and fail to detonate. However wolf ammo makes a spring kit to make the hammer strike harder and defeat this problem. I will be ordering this and trying to put some steel through it soon. I quite like it but will still be replacing the upper with a .. I put my buddys mampp upper on mine and it worked like a charm so I know that theyre compatible. That said Im still looking for a fully assembled m a styled upper. I want a good platform to potentially look at doing  gun for fun. ,austinguns,d3l3mfa,1,t5_30gyk

Never let the muzzle cover anything you are not willing to destroy.      Keep your finger off the trigger until your sights are on the target.      Be sure of your target and what is beyond it.  ,austinguns,d3w8voz,3,t5_30gyk
