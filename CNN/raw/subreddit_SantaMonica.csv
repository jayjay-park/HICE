3390670,0,t3_2yzlfu,I assume youll be biking along the beach bike path if youre going to Venice Beach. I highly recommend you do that on a weekday and not a weekend! Its just too crowded on weekends. Be alert there are always people just walking in the bike path super frustrating when the bike path is alongside a sidewalk and there are tons of signs saying bikes only on the bike path pedestrians only on the sidewalk and in Venice the bike path can be a bit slippery with sand.When the path ends in Venice you can ride along Washington Blvd. to the east theres a bike lane and then bike up the Braude Bike Path again when it starts up in Marina Del Rey. You pass by some big condo buildings then ride through some parking lots and youll eventually get to Ballona Creek. Ride along that back towards the ocean and youll come to a bridge that goes over the creek. Its a nice place to stop and relax for a bit. ,SantaMonica,cperhg0,3,t5_2shny

7461491,1,t1_d2q8t4z,Anyone who says we dont have to worry about earthquakes is sadly mistaken.  During the  Northridge quake the most intense and most publicized damage was out in the San Fernando Valley but Santa Monica was hit anomalously hard given its distance from the epicenter.  The structure of the adjacent Santa Monica Mountains focused the Northridge earthquakes seismic energy on the city by the sea like a lens said Dr. Thomas Jordan director of the Southern California Earthquake Center at USC.  Santa Monicas soft soil and older building stock may have contributed to the devastation.  If you werent here to experience the Northridge quake personally you really have no idea how terrifying and devastating it was to the City of Santa Monica and its residents.,SantaMonica,d2qbpyw,3,t5_2shny

7681106,0,t3_4kab2e,Some folks are complaining but Ill still gladly take it.  Im not comparing it to the baseline of the  minutes itd take to drive on an early Sunday morning.  Im considering a minute relaxing Metro ride a huge improvement over the headache and hassle of the  hour  minute drive at rush hour. Of course Id appreciate an even faster trip on the Expo Line but in my view this is still a great start. ,SantaMonica,d3fan2o,3,t5_2shny

7950719,0,t3_4o3bt3,This has been written about in the past... but its literally my only complaint about being a SM resident  The Ficus Berries. Theyre everywhere. Theyre stuck all over my car inside and out theyre stuck to my shoes and in my doormat basically the streets are covered in a black goo. Dont get me wrong I dont want these trees to be removed but there is another solution. There is an EPA approved injection called Atrimmec that SM inject could into these trees to stop the berries. Newport Beach recently did it and it worked. Thing is its  a tree. So I think you should write a story about why SM hasnt made any sort of plan of action for these GD berries. ,SantaMonica,d49qij3,3,t5_2shny

10087139,0,t3_5k4ebx,Will you have a chance to come apartment hunt ahead of the move or will you have to sign a lease from wherever you are? My company gave me a househunting trip and I got my place by literally just driving up and down the street calling every number on the signs. If you have to get this settled remotely then Westside Rentals is probably a good idea but if youll be here honestly the best places I saw werent online at all. I think they know theyll rent no matter what and as such dont bother advertising online. ,SantaMonica,dbmdec8,2,t5_2shny
