4915339,0,t1_cudflm1,Thank goodness for Ru then! I love it. We have a guy here  born a guy performs lips yncs as a guy doing guy songs  that is a huge hit. Hes got his own little following. Hes usually is our equivalent to a filler queen no shade intended in between numbers while the gurls are quick changing  which is a tremendous help to everyone backstage. Hes such a great addition to the show. So keep doin what youre doin!,Lip_Sync,cue46t9,1,t5_38w21
