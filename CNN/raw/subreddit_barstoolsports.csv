2091773,0,t3_2iuuic,I think two things need to be defined before getting into a deep conversation about this. . Threat . World Peace.At its simplest form lets say youre walking down the street you see a cop with a gun and an emotionally disturbed person flailing his arms. Which one is more of a threat? Sure the cop has a gun and can instantly kill you but hes trained not to unless absolutely needed. The EDP probably couldnt kill you by flailing around but hes a much higher threat to smack you in the face even if by accident. So whats the bigger threat? So lets assume the US is the cop we have the weaponry to pretty much annihilate the whole planet overnight but thats not the reason we have developed our arsenal. IS is the EDP just a reckless and crazy group of people fighting in the name of religion with what is relatively speaking primitive weapons. As far as world peace goes globally the US is the biggest threat to everyone. But realistically speaking theres a  chance itll never come to that. Globally IS doesnt have that reach. Within the Middle East IS is the biggest threat because theyll just roll up and start spraying unannounced. So what does that mean? Theres an old Hindu proverb and Im probably going to completely butcher it but basically there was a race around the world three times to see which god is considered supreme. All the gods immediately started their circle around the earth however Ganesh simply went around his parents three times. He said his parents were his world. Basically the moral is what is considered the world?Honestly if someone was to fuck with America and Americans then thats honestly the only thing I care about. I dont understand day to day life in the Middle East running from rouge military groups always thinking theres a possibility a bomb could go off any second taking yourself the people around you. Maybe they consider that normal? How is what I define as peace sitting at my desk typing this out on reddit the same as someone in the Middle East doing whatever the fuck they do? ,barstoolsports,cl5pl4p,10,t5_2tgz6

Having a sub that prys into their personal lives tracks whos liking what tweet and what some girl looks like only pushes these guys away from that every man feel. I think people dont realize that its a two way street. Barstool is changing but the more aggressive fans get the more closed and private the bloggers will get and a lot of that charm will be gone.
