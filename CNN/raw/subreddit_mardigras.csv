6469586,0,t3_4492vd,Endymion Bacchus Orpheus Rex and Zulu are all good parades. Several parades roll down St Charles. As far as places to go in the French Quarter I like Bar Tonique Bourbon Orleans Carousel Bar and Latitude . They might be a little tame for you though. If you are into dubstep house etc. try Church at the Dragons Den on Sunday. Bourbon Heat is another dance club on Bourbon St. If you are into live music then look into the Galactic show at Tipitinas on Monday night or one of the bars on Frenchmen. There will be plenty of music going on. If you are into rap try and catch a Big Freedia show. I think Juvenile is also playing at Republic on Lundi Gras Monday.,mardigras,czoi1r7,2,t5_2qrml
