1946005,0,t3_2gxcel,Im curious about the details about his claim that the model American puts in  hours to get  miles.  Ill try some rough calculations here although some of the numbers have probably changed since that was written in the s.According to  the average licensed American driver has . vehicles and drives about  miles a year massive increase in miles driven since the s.  And according to  the true cost of driving counting all direct and hidden costs is . per mile although Im sure that depends a lot on what kind of car you have and how you drive it.Put it together and the average American driver spends  driving some of it spent by other people or the government.  At an average wage of about  an hour or about  after taxes that will take  hours to earn.  According to  cant find the original source we spend  minutes a day driving or  hours a year so add that in too for a grand total of  hours a year to drive  miles.Yikes thats almost twice as bad as what Ivan Illich claimed.   hours a year is  hours a day every single day.  Of course those are all just averages its a lot better if you have a high salary and drive a short distance and much worse if you make minimum wage or drive further.  But interestingly the average speed is about the same   . miles per hour.  Were just driving further now.,ranprieur,cknp1td,2,t5_2riu9

7033313,0,t1_d19lbuy,Something I feel is missing here is the idea of contributing to culture. The question was about having an option to change the course of the world. The use of the term interactive media obscures the difference between playing a game that gets you to do something more than watching or listening and having some cultural output. Many trivial games and action games have minimal cultural output. The most the world might be influenced by playing them is the economic vote of buying or downloading a game and the fact that the game players didnt do something else with their time. Some role playing games such as DampD are nothing without cultural production during the game and whoever plays with someone youve played with may be influenced by ideas you started.A life of reading wouldnt necessarily be wasted in terms of cultural production if the reader writes some stories in turn or writes some letters back to authors that influence what those authors write or produces anything else that was influenced by the reading and can influence others. The same for films and music and games and really any arts or skills or knowledge.In response to the emphasized sentence theres some resonance for me but I would say Without computer programming I wouldnt know what it feels like for my momenttomoment thinking and planning and intellectual effort to have some product that means something more than someone said what I wrote or said was smart but Im not sure they werent just being polite. That was just amateur computer programming. Ive also done repairing old audio electronics which had a similar level of challenge in some ways but it wasnt as creative an activity overall. The best results were components that worked the same or hardly significantly better than the original so not very much my creative output. Experimenting with new audio circuits for things like sound effects was a similar level of challenge and opportunity for creativity but I havent done that as much. I think thats what Id do more if programming didnt exist.I still feel like it wont be fully meaningful until others see my software and use it but I would want it to be something thats worth their time to use. I think this might be related to some things Jonathan Blow has said about computers and programming tending to cause depression somewhat mysteriously he implies or at least I havent heard him explain why. The machine can be depressing seeming. It can feel related to the dismal corporate system that tries to make everything humans can consume a manufactured product that can only be made by experts joylessly and property of the corporation because it is part of that system. Learning to program is exciting in part by giving the power back to yourself as an individual and partly because a program can be an intellectual challenge of unlimited scope. Whatever amount of math or other logical information the programmer knows or makes up can be included in a program and it all has to be made to fit together in order for the program to work. Jonathan Blow did mention recently in a talk at some university that when you find what you really want to do and pursue it despite the system that can overcome the depressingness of computers.The worlds of imagination that people use for escape have to be created by someone. Participating in creation can be a further escape. When that creation is shared with others and catches on thats a full escape where the content of the world we experience human culture itself is run by the individuals who perceive it with feeling.What Im promoting sounds something like Rush was writing about in Closer to the Heart and in Spirit of Radio where the problem is that some of the best of that gets sold back to individuals by salesmen so that only a privileged few have the life of cultural creators.Edit I deleted this comment then Ran mentioned a comment that sounded like it and gave a link that was empty. It might be the missing link. So Im reposting it. The reason I delete comments especially at reddit is I dont want to have things that can be downvoted posted long term to worry about. Downvotes can lead to the ability to respond being cut off. So I try not to comment at reddit at all but then if I get carried away writing something and I think it might be helpful and not get downvoted Ill put it up sometimes for the sake of the conversation for maybe one or two people to read it. Then when I delete it I feel a great relief of stress. Ive done that at least three times. I was considering deleting all my old comments and my account. So I just checked the comment policy to see if Im doing something against policy. No Im not. Theres some psychological manipulation in the policy where theyre associating rules on whether a person posts illegal or manifestly harmful content with rules on manipulating votes including rules about not asking for votes. Deleting things is part of what they say they may do as a response or remedy to something wrong as if that will make it better. Deleting is available to users. So it could possibly make my reddit account even better to delete more or all of it. Maybe whats going on here is that reddit is only shadow deleting my comments so I dont see them but others do because Ive deleted too much and they have an invisible policy against that. Whatever. If I was about to delete the account anyway I might as well play with it and see what happens.,ranprieur,d1dkxjh,4,t5_2riu9

10902886,0,t1_de4007y,I would like to thank our disgustingly wealthy global overlord families for turning everyone into an individual selling cheap plastic to try and up their societal value.  The problem now is that a century ago they realized they could all side against all of us.  Used to be they sided with their local group nation or what have you for protection against the other globally wealthy.  At some point this changed.  This is not a culture problem I think so much as it is the end of a divide and conquer that was used on us all.  And wouldnt it be perfect to get rid of the United States with its globally strangling power and gun toting voting populace.  Wouldnt it benefit those trying to exert global controls at the top just fine if we were broken up into squabbling nations like Europe and the Middle East.  Each unable to exert any true global power on their own...,ranprieur,de4jzvp,1,t5_2riu9
11184789,0,t1_dezqpw1,I can maybe answer a little of that. I dont know how old you are I just turned . Once you hit the latter half of your s if youre halfway bright you start realizing how subjective absolutely everything is and how little effect most of us as individuals can have on the macro scale. You also come to grips with the fact that you know jack shit about the nature of reality and that speculating about it is closer to masturbation than philosophy.As Ive gotten older Ive found myself channeling the hitchhikers guide. Like slartibartfast Ive decided we have so little chance of finding out what is actually going on we might as well just say to hell with the sense of it and like zaphod beeblebrox Ive decided the purpose of my life is to have a wonderfully good time.,ranprieur,dezs72f,3,t5_2riu9

11549523,0,t1_dg52v3i,Well... I wasnt exactly suggesting crisis. But even with the new stuff thats coming out even with the stuff I dont like... I hear it yknow? I can listen to newer extreme metal and I dont hear much thats different from what Pantera was doing  years ago. Or with rap either. I just dont hear any real evolution. Im not saying its a crisis exactly... what Im suggesting is that we have reached and past a point at which we can dredge anything truly original out of the musical conventions in which we are working. You can still get GOOD stuff... but not original. I dont think were going to get truly original stuff again until we can find a way to part company with existing conventions WITHOUT getting so weird nobody wants to hear it. Id like to think that this is possible but I have no idea how it would be accomplished.As for the melody thing... its a pretty hard line with me. Rap especially I just cant understand. Basically you have a rhythmic pattern... generally not even a particularly interesting one... and somebody talking. Since youre a fan maybe you can explain it to me what exactly is the appeal? Ive been hearing it for over thirty years and I have to tell you that I have a tough time even categorizing a guy talking over a rhythmic pattern as music.But for sure melody. Its damn near everything as far as Im concerned. You can write literally any lyrics you want and ill be OK with it if I love the tune youre singing them to. Deep Purple is one of my favorite bands from the s and Ian Gillan is a TERRIBLE lyricist. OTOH I do like good lyrics... but when I see good I mean interesting and well written. I couldnt care less about the subject matter. I literally dont give a shit what its about. Maybe thats one of the reasons I dont understand rap... a friend who does listen to that stuff told me its all about messages and meaning. And I just dont care about that stuff. Not even a little.You find the death of album oriented music a little disappointing... I find it crushing. If I cant put your album on and get lost in it for  minutes then I will not listen to you.
