2135549,0,t3_2j2o8k,I think the guy in Massachusetts ended up not having it. There have been many GUYS GUYS THIS ONES GOT EBOLA!! and then heshe doesnt. Its just the media trying to get views. I live in Dallas.. my pediatrician is directly across from the hospital where all this has gone down  Thomas Eric came into contact with roughly  people and of those  only two have gotten sick. Thats because they were caring for him and didnt have proper protective equipment. The hospital is to blame for the two nurses who have gotten Ebola since Thomas Eric. No one else has gotten it and it will probably stay that way. At worst youll see a few more cases pop up but nothing worthy of an epidemic. I feel safe and you saw how close Ive been to the hospital.TLDR Youre safe dont be scared. Edit He actually came into contact with  people before getting care from the hospital and about  nurses after that. So of  people its just been . You and your loved ones are all safe. ,casualconversations,clb9wwe,2,t5_2y1ux
