1813199,0,t3_2faj00,Like you said its a matter of strength and balance. Go over your foundations slowly and cleanly. And try to get each tech clean. Speed comes later. And break each movement down to the basics. Thats why its called foundation.,bboy,ck7o4h9,5,t5_2qun3
1855519,0,t1_ckbuq45,Yo I was writing from my wifes account haha.. Ill try to find out the Riverside session info for you. Theres a decent amount of bboys there but I dont know them that great cause Im originally from Utah. Im in TemeculaMurrieta theres a few crews here but almost everyone from my crew Ill Flavored Rejects has moved. Theres practice at a Golds gym here but I just practice in my garage.,bboy,ckcs9ty,1,t5_2qun3
2048347,0,t3_2i718q,Ive had a similar problem.  Your best bet is to see a doc like everyone else has mentioned and figure out what really is the problem. I had a minor tendinitis and this is how I got my shoulders back to strong health...You need rest for a few weeks then rehab with shoulder mobility exercises dead hangs handstands chest to wall and train on doing some handhops on the airflare push arm for a few months.   Reason being airflares stress the shoulder joints and tendons bad if the joints arent strong enough to handle it.  And strengthening jointstendons is a slow process of progressively loading volume from very light weight til it adapts. If youre not gonna see a doc take your time if you hurt  stop stretch Ice. I hope for the best its such a bothersome injury.,bboy,cl06ufu,2,t5_2qun3
2066152,0,t1_cl2g31r,In the video you posted in your other thread when you try to put your left hand up for support that motion makes your body go back and thats why your legs are hitting the ground however in this video it looks like you got rid of that but what i think youre doing is pushing off the ground with your left arm you should try pushing to the left that way you have . More momentum and . Your body wont have momentum pushing itself back so your legs wont hit the ground.,bboy,cl2gccp,1,t5_2qun3
2100792,0,t3_2iy72m,Its all controlled momentum. The wider your legs are apart the better your feetkicking will help move your body for you. This will also help keep your hips elevated as you roll off your upper back. However if you find yourself pushing more with your upper body your legs will hit the ground every time because you dont have anything keeping them up. If you cant lock your legs outward wide enough to experience the momentum helping pull your body around you should work on flexibility as well. ,bboy,cl6uumx,2,t5_2qun3

2170209,0,t3_2jpumr,Okay. Several things... You have an excellent first windmill. Notice how not only is it fast but your hips pop up well for the first one which allows you to easily complete the next rotation. The issue is that soon after you start to bend your legs. Because of that you fail to maintain the momentum to keep going.Its really problematic when your legs are bent. Here is whyIn physics work or energy is force times distance. When you do work by swinging your legs you are putting in energy into your bodys rotation. However since work J  Forcedistance the longer the distance you are exerting the force the more energy you get and so the faster you spin. This is why you cant bend your legs. The moment you bend your legs you restrict the amount of distance you exert a force over so your body gets less energy gt you slow down and your windmill fails.Thats why your first windmills were so good  you had energy and your legs swung nice and straight keeping you moving fast. Youve connected your windmills well at this point  now your job is to make them clean. BOTH legs have to swing powerfully Joseph. You go clockwise so your main swinging leg is your right leg  however the job of your left leg is to swing back and get you through the restab half of the windmill. I remember how difficult it was learning how to do that  its just not a really natural motion to swing the left leg backwards but you have to master it to master the windmill.And yes what the other guy bboyheartbreaker said  dont practice on a rug. See the work you do with your legs swinging puts energy into your body spinning but FRICTION takes energy away. Thats why smooth floors and smooth sweaters are great because then your body slides better and you dont slow down. ,bboy,clfone5,2,t5_2qun3

3674073,0,t1_cqaoze5,whipping legs and twisting referring to windmills swipes and airflares? yes those require wrist strength they are also not for beginners. i dont think bodyweight conditioning is necessary for improving or safely doing footwork,bboy,cqb2h1c,1,t5_2qun3

9171661,0,t1_d8d7zhg,Alright here is why it ruins the scene. Canada is on the come up and when you call out a judge who is internationally known immediately after he said you have lost is disrespectful. The way you go about it is  wait until the judge is in a cypher much after and call him out then. This way you can think about what your doing and be more rational. Look up ground technique vs all out   kings. This same foolishness took place there. People from other cities know. He crashed into neguin twice. Sometimes things like that make a whole cities scene look bad. But if this is something they are known for. And they keep getting let into the door at events. Then doesnt that say something about the scene. How many other cities do you think have not been happy with a judgement from neguin. Battled him and crashed into him twice.  He travels all over. Im pretty sure it has only happened once. And only will too.,bboy,d8ekqzt,1,t5_2qun3

9903375,0,t3_5h91fi,This is just my opinion...I would start off with the basics.  Drilling foundation is the key.  For example you could do  minutes of top rock to start off practice with.  Then you could practice  step in both directions for whatever length of time that you want.  After this you could practice specific power moves or even just variations of  step  step etc. The rest is up to you and where your fellow dancers are at.  Structure is important but remember to have fun.  ,bboy,dayflfn,5,t5_2qun3
