6019844,0,t1_cy86p4r,Hey  I did not mean to sound harsh I just like your idea and would like to see it happen and come into play cause Im going to be making investments in Simulators.  Wish I can come into London but money is tight right now.  If you wanna talk more in private about manufacturing your Sims then contact on PM or on Skype at speedtechz.  i rather keep my sources off of reddit since they are other trying to conduct VR business the same way I am trying too.  Also yes you have a few followers and one person who would like to use your VR sims to expand my own business.,feelthree,cy8q5i8,1,t5_34k4i
