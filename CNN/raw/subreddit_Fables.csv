744649,0,t1_cgosudn,Ive only ever been on this Subreddit so I went to The Wolf Among Us Subreddit to see if I could find any instances of what you were talking about Wild untrue logic leaps and I find myself agreeing with you on the fact that there are many leaps like the thought that Buffkin could be the killer or Ambrose regardless though I relate it to a child who doesnt know anything about a subject matter and yet postulates over it anything the child says is likely wildly untrue in short Id say theyre misinformed and annoying but I still cant blame them for making those leaps to them its just a mystery that they want to solve so Ill let them run around and play detective and ignore them hopefully theyll become more well versed in the Fables universe.,Fables,cgox8fx,1,t5_2so5o
1293343,0,t3_28tcat,Its a fantastic game and you wont get a deal like this until they release the next season which will take over a year.With that said the game tries not to spoil anything from the comics which means that none of my favourite characters are in it and most of the characters are a bit underpowered as they havent reach the strength they are in the comics. I havent met a fan of the comics who doesnt love the game despite any frustrations though so go buy it.,Fables,cif495a,1,t5_2so5o
1367070,0,t3_295ir4,Id wager its going to be only the one season. Take The Walking Dead for example to my knowledge it was never planned to have a second season but the overwhelming success of the first made them realize it had even more potential. Dont get me wrong Id love to see some more Wolf Among Us but I dont personally think its gonna happen. ,Fables,cinng9p,1,t5_2so5o

1580565,0,t1_cjeeexc,Right it went something like thisSnow Fables that cant pass as humans have to go to the Farm.  And you are banned from the Farm.Bigby Well why are we having this conversation then?Snow I have a cursed dagger.  Its bite would allow a human able to walk as a wolf.  But Totenkinder told me it would also allow a wolf to walk as a man.  Guess this time I get to draw your blood.,Fables,cjeej06,3,t5_2so5o
2338657,0,t3_2m43zq,Well the fact that glamours are expensive and necessary for animal fables to travel the mundy world is a fairly large part of the comics and the cause of tension between the Farm and the city Fables. They come up often throughout the comics.,Fables,cm0rqys,3,t5_2so5o
2973262,0,t1_co5r8wm,Oh yeah that. Im trying not to be spoilery for you but theres plenty of times from a war that happens and later that I just went NO mentally.,Fables,co62q1i,2,t5_2so5o
3096048,0,t3_2vm2lm,Its a tie between  and . The color composition with the characters on their respective covers looks really good to me along with containing emotions I cant easily describe.,Fables,coiwkkz,6,t5_2so5o
3156699,0,t3_2w9vwm,A very interesting point. I think the Literal explanation for the Mundy world being the way it was is an interesting one certainly. I wish it had been explored more. Like what if the reason Fables got more powerful from Mundy popularity was because Mr. Literal was literally bottlenecking all of that magical power so that the Fables received all of it instead.Of course Mr. Revise also said something along the lines of making the world consistent enough for science to be even a thing. It makes you wonder how long it will take for the Mundy world to start falling apart when its own scientific foundation begins to crumble.,Fables,cop6twg,1,t5_2so5o
3492281,0,t1_cppubhg,Thanks!  I really liked that one too! The reason for so many sketches is that I was participating in Inktober where you as an artist should try to ink a drawing every day for the month of October.So theres a lot of mistakes because I only laid down a very small outline of what I was gonna ink! You can kind of see some of the outline left in some of the sketches! I ended up coloring them with the same color I outlined with so they are somewhat hidden!It was fun! Sorry for the ramble just some random info! ,Fables,cpqcfh2,1,t5_2so5o
4135035,0,t3_37yboq,Seems really interesting! Ill try to keep up and look out for any posts. Any person thats a fan of Fables and Steven Universe is a friend of mine xD!,Fables,crrm4vo,2,t5_2so5o
4685849,0,t1_ctl5vlx,No you are wrong. She was never weak like that and she did not like Bigby before the first trade. There is no way to defend this. She didnt act like that in the homelands. I talked to bill personally about this and he agrees,Fables,ctl72ze,-1,t5_2so5o
4871186,0,t1_cu8gy41,You are right also the inclusion of the Page Sisters seems off I mean they were Literals but since that story was metaretconned within the story shouldnt the Fables dont know who this three mundies are? Or did Snow and Bigby only pretended they were losing their memories? But then again the list on the Laundromat was for the prophecy of death not Goldilocks list since Cindy was on her list but not on THE list.,Fables,cu8jtm6,1,t5_2so5o
