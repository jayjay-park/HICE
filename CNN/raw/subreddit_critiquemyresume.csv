5680027,0,t3_3sv9kt,Is Digital Culture similar to Digital Humanities? When I first started my degree I did two semesters in ArtsMedia Informatics which was a new course that later changed to being called Digital Media and Informatics. It was admitedly problematic choosing a name for the course as it was difficult to find a name which represented what it really was while trying to get others to recognise it who werent in the field. Anyway Im saying this to empathise with your situation. However I think if youre applying for jobs where your degree will be directly related youll probably find hiring managers have at least a vague understanding of what the degree is about. However below your degree you should bullet point  or  key points about projectsmodules you did and tailor them depending on the job youre applying for. Next in your skills section you list lot of good programslanguages you can do but you need to cut some of them out. Again if the job description doesnt require it then delete it band leave the ones in that are relevant. Once youve done that you need to say how you used them. So instead of saying Arduino you should say Independent Arduino project where I developed an automatic trigger for an SLR using motion detection.Maybe bullet point your job rolesdescription so their easier to pick out. ,critiquemyresume,cx15wdi,2,t5_31aki

My biggest issue with it is there is very little information explaining your responsibilities. PM me your email and Ill send you over what I have done with your CV and mine so you can see how youd set up the job information. Happy to help you explain what youve done under your jobs as well ,critiquemyresume,cz4ayw4,1,t5_31aki
