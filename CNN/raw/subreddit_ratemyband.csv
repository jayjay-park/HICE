964886,0,t3_24dq7n,Nice I feel like the songs generally got stronger as the album progressed.  I like how there was a mix of softer and harder songs I think doing that makes albums feel more like an experience per say.,ratemyband,chdyt6a,1,t5_2szwv
993389,0,t1_chh3qpy,Cheers man really appreciate it. Our drummers massively into Biffy and the early Muse is a massive compliment. Were based in the NorthEast round Newcastle and Durham. Weve just released an EP so Im about to put that up on this subreddit check it out if you like the other stuff. Im the vocalist and guitarist in my band and we were quite set on keeping the vocals lower but the guy we recorded with really wanted them higher. Its our debut EP as well so I was a bit weirded out by hearing my own voice so high in a mix but I got used to it. I can totally understand why you might want to bury it a bit if youre more used to playing live. ,ratemyband,chh7eqj,2,t5_2szwv

1299384,0,t3_28upkk,Nice use the stereo perspective though it seems to be a little too distant with the excess reverb.  The pitch correction seems a little too harsh as well.  Other than that I enjoyed it.  It reminded me a lot of Dashboard Confessional.,ratemyband,cifspuo,3,t5_2szwv
1476499,0,t3_2b334u,The electric guitar in the intro makes the song sound a little chaotic but then it all comes together before the vocals come in and it sounds pretty good! I like the beat but the vocals could be a little more interesting.,ratemyband,cj1crqo,1,t5_2szwv
1979139,0,t3_2h6qg4,Definitely get these recorded at some point. Has flavours of City amp Colour although that could just be my own interpretation. Nice vocal melodies and chord progressions. Downloaded!,ratemyband,ckroqt4,1,t5_2szwv

2343972,0,t3_2jn5tu,Loving the instrumentals. The vocals seem could be angrier because that would go with the beat. Just my opinion. Also call it Dog Song,ratemyband,cm1fddw,2,t5_2szwv
2577028,0,t3_2p675h,I give it a . sounds like someone likes Young The Giant. Great voice and cool rhythm but the production could be a little warmer sounds sort of cold and crowded at points. Lyrics sound thought out which is rare to find these days but Its cool. ,ratemyband,cmuyf41,1,t5_2szwv

3180843,0,t1_corol26,As I said I have no issue with lofi.  Its just in your case I think your music is good enough to benefit from things just being tightened up a bit.  The drum sound would really be the main area I see this.  It could just be much drier.   EG Bad Religion or Minor Threats early albums are far from epic production but there is still a nice separation between the instruments while still sounding raw.  Thats more what I meant.Just advice from a seasoned giggerrecorder of Punkish music!  I am  and still doing it occasionally so I definitely know about life getting in the way lol.,ratemyband,coroyz4,2,t5_2szwv

3868943,0,t3_34jyqb,Cool song man like your voice! Although theres a little thing I found slightly annoying. Theres quite a lot of breath and general mouth noise it might just be me but I find it a little unsettling. Although personally I wouldnt completely cut it out though because it kinda goes with the intimate style of the music but maybe just turn it down a bit.But overall did like your song nice and emotional and close.Oh and a little tiny thing I noticed there a mic or something popping at around ,ratemyband,cqxak6y,2,t5_2szwv

6211438,0,t3_4034xw,I really like the overall sound of this Song. Especially the guitar and bass are on point for a noisy alternative Rock Song. Your vocal delivery may not be everyones cup of tea but that is all just subjective. I think it fits the feeling of the song!,ratemyband,cyvo9c2,1,t5_2szwv
6924721,0,t1_d10q248,Thank you so much for the feedback this was really enjoyable to read ha. Yeah the surf tone is definitely something were interested in as it gives off a really dark but punchy sound to it. Often fits well with our writing style. That is really really cool. We are a Manchester UK based band but have been in contact with an NYC promoter who runs a club. When we do eventually fly over and do some shows perhaps early next year We would love to contact you. Respect with the Eric Garner stuff also that shit makes my fucking blood boil but also inspired our work. Thomas The Blinders. x,ratemyband,d118pl3,1,t5_2szwv
6932955,0,t1_d10rgpc,Im not sure what genre haha because to me it doesnt have the poppunk sound that Green Day has with all that riffing in the song. Perhaps its up for my brain to debate that hahaha. Ill check out NOFX though. Its awesome that we have this sub to share music and ideas. In terms of genremashing Im no good at that hahaha. And about Lost in Space that means a lot especially about the puppy drawing I painted that myself haha,ratemyband,d126d0g,1,t5_2szwv

8756443,0,t3_4zjudp,the intro has a very vintage country western vibe to it. very cool. at  when that drum hits you know something awesome is coming. I really like how the guitars sound. they sound warmer than i expected them to sound especially on a song with this much energy. a lot of times bands and even myself choose to go with a heavier more distorted guitar that almost rips your ears off but the guitars on this track are extremely tame and warm sounding. very pleasant at almost any volume i really like that. was that done intentionally? and if not did you record the guitars in a certain way that would take off some of the high end or muffle it somehow?anyway the vocals are incredibly clean which is really cool. the singers voice reminds me a lot of Serj Tankian with the very calm but extremely emotional pitch and delivery and can quickly go in and out of screams with ease.overall i think this is a very solid track with lots of energy and extremely well produced! thanks for sharing!

10576556,0,t3_5gxcjf,Great vibe on this track! I really like the vocal super psychedelic! Actually my one suggestion might be to apply even more psychedelic effects like echoes and delays to the vocal. Also i might raise the volume on the oohing in the background a little more that part is really nice and Id love to hear it louder great work all round though!,ratemyband,dd6w0px,1,t5_2szwv
