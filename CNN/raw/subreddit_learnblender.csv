5289415,0,t3_3nfpde,Thanks for making this. Even at  hours on and off with Blender Im still confused as hell on ...everything. I absolutely adore Blender though I really do. Ive tried other D programs and I keep going back to Blender. However since moving and buying a laptop Ive been trying to just mess around on the program and not trying to render any scene.,learnblender,cvns9wc,3,t5_3a6wl
