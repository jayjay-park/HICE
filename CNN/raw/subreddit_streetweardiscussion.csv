10750013,0,t3_5tsglc,As a very tall thin legged guy cm  kg with broad shoulders though wide pants look awful on me.I really really like them though but my build just doesnt accomodate them trust meSo Im sticking to skinny to accentuate my long legs rd of my torso. Helps also that Im not that masculine of a dudeAlso as someone from Japan wide legged pants have been highly highly popular in the fashion scene here for a long long time more so than west,streetweardiscussion,ddos589,3,t5_3igpm
