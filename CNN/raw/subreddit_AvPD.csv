3799251,0,t3_33w7vx,Im  and I recently facebook messaged a cousin of mine that I hadnt talked to in  years.  It went over just fine.  The party I talked about in another reply to you also went fine.  Hadnt seen any of those people in  years. I think it just comes with the territory that we fade out of existence sometimes.  Ive generally found that people miss me and that Im pretty nice to be around.  Even though they sometimes feel offended by my disappearance a very brief explanation and reminder that it wasnt anything personal will usually smooth things over enough for us to at least start talking.  I have no close friends but I have begun to reconnect with some people.  Even if its not the level of connection Id really like its still progress.   Hopefully you can forgive yourself for disappearing and hopefully they can do the same. I bet they will if you do  Just try sending an email or text first maybe?,AvPD,cqpceos,3,t5_2vjua
4534956,0,t3_3d3hk2,Absolutely Ive also found that drinking also helps me get past my avoidant tendencies. As others have already said though moderation is key the last thing you want is to become completely dependent on it to function in your daytoday activities. Ive personally had this happen with my own substance use in general alcohol amp pot mostly and believe its done more harm than good over the years as far as my AvPDrelated issues are concerned wherein Ive spent more time hiding from them behind those substances than trying to actually address them.This isnt to say youll necessarily have the same issues with substance use as Ive had if you choose to use them but I do believe using them to cope with our shared condition here makes it markedly more risky than for the general population. Just something to keep in mind moving forward.,AvPD,ct29i4p,2,t5_2vjua

6413520,0,t3_43ieq6,Havent tried that one but been on another MAOI Moclobemide which may have been one of the more helpful meds Ive been taking and Ive been thinking about trying to get back on that. I felt less socially inhibited when I was on that but it may have been due to other factors hard to tell because there were other strange things going on in my life at that time. There is nothing wrong with your post by the way hope youll decide to come back and post more.,AvPD,czinhsq,1,t5_2vjua
6443714,0,t1_czi730b,I can relate to this in a broader sense. For example Im a big fan of songs that contain a lot of braggadocio because I can loop them in my head like a mantra and sort of adopt the artists personality.

8571379,0,t3_4x11vr,I get this every day and Ive lost a lot of weight unintentionally However!  I have found what helps is making yourself eat SOMETHING for breakfast. Eating is hard so I make myself a very small bowl of yogurt and honey. It slips right down my throat very cool and soothing and delicious easy to eat even when you dont feel like eating. Doing this each day actually starts the metabolism going and I find that my appetite is better on days when I have something to eat first thing. I will actually feel hunger during the day if Ive eaten in the morning.Do give it a try not eating all day contributes to how crappy you feel physically and mentally and you deserve to feel well. xxxxx,AvPD,d6d05r0,1,t5_2vjua

8781657,0,t3_5073bb,Im also AvPD without SAD though I do have GAD and I have to say Im similar but not the same. Again fine with performing socially whatever but its not that I cant deal with what comes after.. its more like I do alright through a mask but Im never genuinely connecting so its painful and useless. I selfsabotage with nonsense so no one actually gets to know me while really wanting people to know me.I dont mind the confusion with SAD especially since we all have fuckall of mental health education but I wish more people here talked about AvPD specific symptoms so those of us who are the same have more of a community. Posts like this help thank you.,AvPD,d73dmft,2,t5_2vjua
8787861,0,t1_d73qysv,Thanks for commenting! I dont know if its related to AvPD either but I wanted to ask somewhere I think some people would relate. Haha I do the googling too and even though Christina Tosi is still pretty much perfect she is getting so much hate. Ok not so much but for someone whos not a celebrity I thought it was unlikely. It somehow helps putting things in perspective. Shes still human and like anyone in the public eye shell have people who dislike her. Oh well. ,AvPD,d745n5i,2,t5_2vjua

I cringe hard at the memory of me telling doctors my depression symptoms with little privacy and in front of . It was terribly awkward. I was then sent to a psychologist I went a few times and he told me I should move out get a job and maybe go to the military and stuff. My mom doesnt have much money so theres no way Im going to keep wasting her small amount of money on that.Theres not really anyone I can ask for a job. I have no friends and if my family could help me get a job they would have told me already.Ugh getting a job sounds really fucking hard.,AvPD,d7k8jid,2,t5_2vjua
8965296,0,t3_531hqa,This week has been a roller coaster. Started normal which for me is fairly dull. I play fantasy football and last night my guy ended up doing really well so I was jazzed about that.  Like an hour later I go outside to see my  year old German Shepherd is seizing and I have no idea for how long. Get him to the ER vet and find out his core temp had spiked beyond the range of their thermometer. Somewhere north of . F for a couple hours at least. I feel fucking horrible and basically have to decide if were going to put him down since his brain is probably cooked at this point. How can I say goodbye to him?,AvPD,d7phrzo,6,t5_2vjua

9704831,0,t3_5e312h,Ive always treated talking to other humans like an RPG. You have your dialogue choice dial. Canned responses. Multiple choices. My ten years working retail has given me at least some practice having these extremely short random encounters with the dangerous mob type known as customers. The only problem of course is that our dialogue choices consist of more than just four though we can usually try to default with ... oh yeah and right. I try to find the right response but I have to pull it up right on the spot. Under normal circumstances I try to come up with a improvised adlibbed and rehearsed script in my head and attempt to play it out properly but of course I always mess up my lines. Occasional research in the small talk having has resulted in me recently adding in the new dialogue opener Whats new with you? to substitute for the unreliable and inferior How are you? specifically for those repeat encounters. I suppose it also helps that I try to read up on and be aware of various topics absorbing whatever knowledge I can get my hands on in order to be somewhat proficient in talking about it. Video games the occult movies almost every music genre meme culture. Those are my strengths and Im aware that my weaknesses are politics cars and emotional awareness but I aim to work on those eventually. I try to be open to everything. It gives me ammunition for future battles. They usually last at least two minutes anyway. For the most part and this is all pertaining to physically talking to humans and not online its a relief when they leave. Then I can just reset and be ready for the next one.,AvPD,da9bu8l,5,t5_2vjua

I was doing both individual sessions and group I have very few problems these days and its been years since I had an anxiety attack. I was given great tools on how to cope with my anxiety and depression and Ive learned to actually like myself  Im still an introvert but a social one ,AvPD,dap229t,9,t5_2vjua
9889576,0,t3_5gyj4i,I relate somewhat. Im  still finishing high school online because my avpd just makes it so difficult. I was supposed to graduate last year and havent yet. My parents are mad because they know how late I am graduating and also because I dont even have a job. I dont know much about college yet obviously but maybe theres something you can do to help your situation? Theres usually always some option. Also its not a real job but if youre looking to contribute some money to your house because of your parents I would check out some online work. I do some transcription work on Rev right now as a freelancer just for some extra money to help my parents and to not feel more like a burden than I am lol. You can look at rbeermoney or rworkonline. Hope this helps a little. Just remember a lot of people with AVPD are in similar situations so youre not alone in it. ,AvPD,dawmuvl,3,t5_2vjua

10123629,0,t1_dbr3w59,Well actually youre right. It wasnt exactly talking to my father that did it. It was the act of doing something I was afraid of. The three days leading up the day I could barely sleep. I kept breaking down into tears. I was scared but I just didnt care anymore. I literally kept thinking to myself its thisconfronting my dad or die. And possibly the reason I changed so drastically is the fact Ive been reading about self improvement psychology and philosophy all my life. I internalized all the knowledge but I simply could never apply it because I had zero self esteem. ,AvPD,dbr45x0,0,t5_2vjua
10337911,0,t3_54u94v,Yup major escapist here. Since about  years I also havent been able to fall asleep without watching  listening to something.

10419991,0,t1_dcp4axl,No I hear you for sure. Ive wondered about narcissism as well. Im a weird mix of all sorts of stuff. But my thought process in all this is These people fucking hate my guts to the point where theyd never want to drink or party around me. So if Ive had that experience with most people and people on this forum hang out with people like that and are accepted by them then it makes me wonder if theyd reject me too.Its just a super extreme fear of rejection really.,AvPD,dcp6aqc,1,t5_2vjua

11010877,0,t3_5x7toe,I get that. I have a similar situation just with different causes. I never meet people because I never do anything social with strangers.
