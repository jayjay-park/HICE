626116,0,t1_cgb68ee,Do this.   MUD nailed it.  My buddies and I do exactly this and have landed some whoppers in NY.   Weve taken a number of carp in excess of lbs with this method.  Heres a x carp somewhere between lbs and lbs we got doing exactly this.    More specifically we use  baitholder hooks with  pieces of corn on the shank.   Weve had no problem landing them on lblb test just make sure you have at least  yards of it on your reel.     A little tip if you see carp jumping fish right in the midst of the activity. ,CarpFishing,cgbfv0o,2,t5_2u46m
1306712,0,t3_290xak,You want to use smallish size  natural looking flies like wolly buggers and nymphs.   Carp are especially fond of flies with a rusty brown type of color.       Your best bet is to first visually see the carp and then cast either in their direction or ahead of where they are going.   If they are mudding up the bottom it will help to use a weighted fly.    Be patient and use as light a flourocarbon leader as you can get away with.  Carp are an incredible challenge on the fly good luck!!,CarpFishing,cigme4q,1,t5_2u46m
4635916,0,t1_ctex0h2,Im from the UK so fishing is quite a lot different! Catch and release is the way forward! I personally normally fish at between  yards on most of the waters I fish with the odd smaller lake  rods at lb tc and okuma baitrunners not a glamorous setup but it works!  Its always fun playing a bigger fish on a light rod sometimes youre just left praying you still land it!   Best of luck with it and I look forward to seeing bigger and better fish to come!,CarpFishing,ctexcep,2,t5_2u46m
