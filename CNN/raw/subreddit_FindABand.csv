10415257,0,t3_5jgavn,Ohai! My names Andrew Im able to do screams if your ever looking for that kind of vocals I never know what to call it. Im not really able to sing. If not I understand. I do have a soundcloud just for reference. note to self cover is only time I sangI know Im not the greatest at recording but that stuff was done for fun and just to see what I was able to do. I am trying to get better though. I am only good at screams though I cant go super low like growls but my screams are good enough to understand. I will get a better mic if the one I have wont cut it ,FindABand,dcomyed,1,t5_2urxf
