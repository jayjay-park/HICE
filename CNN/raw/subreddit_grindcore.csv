1229481,0,t3_2866o4,I like the intensity the pure fullblown explosion of energy. I use intense music to help me calm down. Laying on my bed and listening to something like Agoraphobic Nosebleed just draws all the tension and anger and frustration right out of me. Its totally cathartic and relaxing. Most people dont understand that or how I go to sleep every night listening to death metal and techno but it works for me.I also think deep guttural growls sound fucking rad. Again its kind of a powerenergy thing. Shouts and shrieks are ok too but the growls and roars are my favorite. I like how grind doesnt ever get boring its always changing things up whether it be short songs or changing up the rhythm and riffs within a song. Its always moving forward never sticking in the same spot too long.As for other music I like I mostly go for fast heavy highenergy music. I like all sorts of Punk Hardcore and Metal and listen to a lot of electronic music too like Trance Dubstep DnB and Gabber. Ive recently been branching out and getting into hiphop too.,grindcore,ci7xnbn,3,t5_2r1n8
2196073,0,t3_2k6q1r,There are some things that are kind of interesting in here but it mostly comes off very teenage and edgy. Lose the pig squeals quite frankly you dont have the ear to incorporate them well see the work which transforms god.
