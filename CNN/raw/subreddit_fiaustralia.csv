I live in my parents place in melbourne and just started a new job last month which pushed my earnings up to k plus a small bonus. I dont have a specific target for FIRE since its too early for me to know what my expenses will be once I move out and eventually have kids but my medium term goal is to buy a first home mortgage free with my girlfriend in  years.,fiaustralia,cvxbkda,3,t5_39zkf

7182196,0,t3_4dto0j,It looks like youve hit your upper limit in salary given the skills that you have. A change of job isnt going to solve that except change the scenery. Are you interested in learning new skills? If so maybe you can try a different role at your company since theyre missing staff.Curious how old are you? I think you have the option to take risks like a job change. But yeah you wont necessarily be better off financially. Look around for another job if you like. I think every job is the same as every other. Its important to me to be FI more than it is to enjoy life. Obviously very different to your mentality. So for me the higher the pay the better.   ,fiaustralia,d1ujwql,4,t5_39zkf

7696707,0,t1_d3h1rjr,An offset accounts works by not having to pay interest on every dollar you have in there. They also give you the ability to still use that money if you need to.So for example if your interest rate is  you are making  on every dollar you in your offset because you arent being charged interest on those dollars.So no matter what putting money into your offset guarantees saving money. Not putting money in your offset guarantees spending money through interest.The next calculation is tax if you invested  elsewhere and say you earned  on top of the  well now you have to pay tax on that profit. So your actual take home is now only  when you are on less than a k salary meaning your investment only cleared a ROI of ..And thats remembering that an investment of  per year is pretty fantastic and there WILL be years where you take a loss.So in our example here you can guarantee a  saving on every dollar you put in your mortgage but if you invest it you the best case  still only amounts to . better.Thats a huge risk with a massive downside.An initial ROI of  reduces to . after you pay tax on the profit so you are making a loss compared to just leaving the money in your offset.Putting money in your offset isnt sexy. Its not fun. You cant tell mates you me ROI and how much you are making. But youll out do them time and time again because not spending money is a better strategy than investing money.,fiaustralia,d3h2d8o,6,t5_39zkf
7699149,0,t1_d3hc8i4,Okay I think I get it now.

7699437,0,t1_d3hcgkw,No I think you misunderstood. We have paid off K but it is available to redraw and have K to go. Our interest is still not zero. In offset terms we wouldnt have reached parity yet i.e. we are not in credit.,fiaustralia,d3hdj20,1,t5_39zkf

8481017,0,t3_4vqrek,Hmmm very interesting. I wondering what this will do to property speculators? I seen that CBA is only passing on  basis points which is hilarious. Even more so that it takes them two weeks to actually pass on any cut they deem suitable. How is this not illegal?Looks like the cash rate is heading south with many pundits predicting more cuts to come by the end of the yearearly next year. Makes me nervous to hold cash. As they are essentially printing more and more of it which of course means it inevitably becomes less and less valuable. Are we entering the low cash rate era? Or is it only a matter of time before it shoots back up? With the state of the world economy I cant see that happening anytime soon. I laugh when people say that . is so low and it cant possibly go any lower. Have they seen the rest of the world? Australia has one of the highest cash rates! Nearly everyone is borrowing cheap credit. How does this cycle stop without something extraordinary happening? ,fiaustralia,d61o5sp,2,t5_39zkf
8683775,0,t3_4xi92r,I look at older workmates as my motivation for staying on track and retiring young theres nothing wrong with being old and still working but its not something that I want any part of.  Ive got two main luxuries dining out and traveling I earn a decent wage to afford both plus these things keep me sane and refreshed.  Btw if you dont want kids go out and get a vasectomy it was the best  bucks Ive ever spent and it makes FI that much easier.  ,fiaustralia,d6r3ipo,1,t5_39zkf

10702494,0,t1_ddjrlzg,It really comes down to what your definition of FIRE is and how technical you want to be about it. I would never recommend that the pension be part of your FIRE plans. BUT if you want to argue semantics it could be use in a FIRE plan. Wouldnt be a good plan but you could do it. ,fiaustralia,ddjvsfn,1,t5_39zkf
10717864,0,t3_5t5wff,Explain to her your FI goal and that she can be a part of it too obviously but will require her to contribute.  Explain why you want to do it with her and get more out of life together. If she doesnt want to sacrifice just explain that if we split finances now then you will continue to have split finances when you reach your FI goal and semi  permanently retire. eggs are no big deal you shouldnt let that bother you as such. But continued wastage does become a problem.Im the sole provider  yr old at home and i agreed with wife to give her an allowance. Includes her discretionary spending but the way i budget it is the allowance is an expense to me and once its gone its gone.This method has helped me dramatically and now i basically ignore any purchases i think are a waste or surplus. Lets me budget and she cant affect my progress.Best part is she has begun working in the business too and the allowance is reducing! ,fiaustralia,ddlgv71,1,t5_39zkf

11019919,0,t1_degamra, Jack Bogle as the founder of the Vanguard group wrote some of the best books on investing so many of us prefer to go to his company for ETFs and funds the ownership structure of the Vanguard group is interesting because its set up in a way that benefits the stock holders more. I cant remember the specifics but its similar to a nonprofit set up. Whereas a lot of other fund companies are for profit. Not that theres anything wrong with a for profit company I just think vanguard is tried and tested might as well go with it. ,fiaustralia,deh2sia,5,t5_39zkf

11603877,0,t3_64w58a,Very true.  I only started last year too following the out of control financial feeling that comes with buying a house.  I assumed frugality would be like being on a diet and youd be constantly expending will power to avoid the purchasing of stuff.  I was a bit surprised how much more I enjoy the challenge of not spending and appreciating the stuff I already own its not nearly as much of an effort as I thought.Chocolate however still requires every bit of will power I have!,fiaustralia,dgbb4rd,2,t5_39zkf
