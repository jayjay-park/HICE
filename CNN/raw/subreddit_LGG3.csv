Anyways the LG G had some problems with screens overheating and destroying the screen on phones that were running custom ROMs. And since its already widely known that the LG G sometimes even has to throttle the brightness just because normal processes can be too much for it it might not be wise flashing anything onto this phone. ,LGG3,cike0lr,1,t5_2ypp1

A centimeter difference in any direction and your screen may not have shattered. My wife whom I have been with  years is especially clumsy with her cell phone and has dropped it more times than I can begin to count on every type of surface possible and has never had a screen crack.

2288239,0,t3_2lgfy3,The reboots Im not sure. You may need to factory reset if it continues try to get a replacement from your carrier.You switched it from a  camera mode to a  mode go back to the camera and choose WM in the Settings icon you probably have it on M.I dont think its awful it does pretty well for me. Do you have HDR on? It improves a lot of lighting issues when used in welllit settings but hurts the picture seriously in lowlight in my experiences. You may have it on and it just isnt working for sunset pictures. Focusing isnt too hard just tap where you want to focus should grab it immediately.Well that phone had a MP camera and probably enforced lower JPG quality than the G. The G has a MP  or MP  camera so itll automatically have larger pictures. It also has the JPG quality set pretty high by default. Im not sure Id believe that its X the space usage though how big are the SD cards? You could lower the resolution of the image as well.Something Ill add in that you may or may not be comfortable doing if you are open to rooting the device you can add in some extra camera tweaks that open up quite a few extra options.

2352308,0,t3_2maoes,Its different for different people. It all depends on what you did when you rooted. First you should simply try to take the update. If it fails then nothing bad will happen youll just get an error message. If you get an error then you can try to undo what youve done by uninstalling adawayand reverting back to the original hosts file andor uninstalling SuperSU. I believe theres an uninstall option from within the SuperSU application.If that doesnt work then youll want to completely revert back to stock and this guide can help.

3159358,0,t1_copfwl4,Im completely stock no root. So no Greenify and no actual optimization or battery management. All I have is most Google junk disabled Music Movies Games Newsstand Hangouts Google and Search. Ive noticed that the latest google play services eats a lot of battery if you have these apps available because each of them constantly runs your GPS to track your location. Next thing I keep my brightness at  and I tend to use dark themes. Every app that has some sort of dark theme is enabled and my background image is quite dark itself. I know its nothing significant but I like to think that its something. I also run Wifi data and high accuracy GPS all the time. If youre using a weather widget make sure its simple and preferably manually updated. Use a custom launcher Nova is my pick  and dont quit or force close apps. Android is amazing at managing its memory and it works so that the more RAM is full the better. How so? Well if you force quit an app to make space and speed up your phone Android will simply launch another app to take its place thus using your battery. So dont bother with taskers and app killers because theyre the real battery killers. Hope I could help.,LGG3,copgrl5,1,t5_2ypp1

That issue was supposedly fixed in the latest CM. nightly which I flashed this morning. I got the G this afternoon and have been playing with both since. OPO on . nightly and G on stock.Pluses for OPO Better optimized operating system less junk more customizable. Seems snappier during general use. Supposedly much better battery life I havent had enough time with the G but from what Ive read it cant go  days of light use like I can with OPO. Hardware button. Bigger built in storage at  vs. GB.Pluses for G Better phone shape in hand OPO is much taller and I can manage a G a lot better in one hand. Better button placement. Much faster camera when it comes to focus. Replaceable battery SD card expansion up to GB.I cant tell yet Screen I wasnt able to see pixelation on my p Nexus  and I still cant on either the OPO or the G. The G is supposedly slightly brighter but so far it seems pretty conservative with auto brightness.I might flash a debloated stock rom on the G but it lags when I do pull down menus and all the icons are way too big on the top bar. Which annoys me. But boy does it feel good in hand.,LGG3,crapg0q,2,t5_2ypp1
3986646,0,t3_363gj8,I did the same thing when my N shattered Im fairly happy with it and plan to keep for the next few years but I wouldnt have upgraded if my N was still fine. I paid about  for my GB one locally the price has dropped since then If you look on eBay you should be able to get it for cheaper if youre not worried about warranty The G has a very low failure rate compared to other phones from what Ive heard and that was definitely one of the reasons I went with it. The G doesnt feel faster it has a higher clocked chip but the N is just a bit snappier and more responsive  this is on the stock rom. Turn window animations on in developer settings when you get it. For some reason theyre turned off by default and it makes the whole UE feel really jerky the animations are there to cover delays which the G has plenty of. Turning them off is a really bad UE decision.Battery and camera are the main advantages the size of the phone is also a huge difference but thats just personal preference. If you ever want more than GB storage you have to go with the G. The G also has a removable battery. I bought a spare  charger which should be here soon and should help with the mediocre battery life although its still a bit better than the NUpdates on the international version arent really slow but LG doesnt really seem to care much about its older devices so we wont get the new G UI for example.I wouldnt say the screen is all that much better. Colours on the N are more natural albeit with lower contract. The screen on the N definitely gets brighter.The G also gets hotter compared to the N. Dont think there are any major bugs in the software or anything.,LGG3,crapoko,2,t5_2ypp1

4619968,0,t1_ctcov94,Mine came with Lollipop so i dont know whether sticking with kk is better. But as is the case you are better off to upgrade as lollipop brings OS wise a lot to the Android ecosystem. The way to do it would be sign in to your device on kk do not install apps and customize and directly update to lollipop with minimal stuff. Check another thing the bands available on the International model might differ from the ones in State. ,LGG3,ctcx9jp,1,t5_2ypp1

And the ATampT Drive mode FamilyMap Live Navigator ProtectPlus SmartWiFi.  All of these have better versions on the play store or you never use them.  They are taking up space or launch automatically and annoy you.  at least they annoy me  Or they start auto updating as soon as you connect to WiFi... Its called bloatware and your phone runs smoother and faster without it.  All those apps you never use but it wont let you uninstall.

6049611,0,t3_3yd917,Which stock ROM were you using before CM.?Id recommend Euphoria instead of CM. if you want AOSP and Fulmics ROM if you want stock LG. Personally Ive experienced better battery life on stock than on any AOSP ROM and the best performance Ive had on Euphoria. Im currently using Fulmics just because of the camera. What I dont understand is why everyone is saying that the M camera is any good? Its awful the pictures look cartoony and posterized when zoomed in. The best camera in my opinion for AOSP ROMs Lollipop only is the snapdragon camera which you can find hereTo sum it up in your case if you want the best camera  go with stock. If you want better performance  go with AOSP,LGG3,cyclvnc,1,t5_2ypp1

6464109,0,t1_cznx7wu,Yes I got it to work. I actually learned this when the external SD card was first locked down one or two major versions ago. But I dont remember why it was unlocked down  I thought I switched ROMs and the problem was fixed but maybe I just dreamed this.Note that I was not able to get Titanium Backup to load my preferences that were on my external SD Card from my previous install before MM. That almost bothers me most about the new sd card permissions. I had to go through and set all new options. Oh well...Anyway the fix is this Go to Preferences gt Backup folder location.  Click on Storage provider at the top its not obvious that its clickable.  Click on DocumentProvider storage. That will take you to a FileManage interface.   You may have to click on the dot menu on the topright to enable the external SD card to be shown then click the menu lines in the topleft and select your SD card and click the Select at the bottom right. You dont have to select your Titanium Backup folder here youre just using this to get access to your SD Card.  Now you should be back in Titanium Backup and you can browse like you used to to get to your preferred backup folder on your external SD CardI warn you that using this Document Provider storage is much slower  at least it seems so for me. But it seems that its the only way to go for now. Hope this works for you!,LGG3,cznxm3s,7,t5_2ypp1

So yes you will have issues trying to install an OTA update. It will just fail to install when it reboots to recovery. You might be able to update using the PC based LG Software Update tool but this will usually only work if its a full update not just a patch update. This means you may have to use an older version first and then either take the OTAs up to the current version or install the remaining updates with the PC tool after installing the older version. ,LGG3,d0rdggz,3,t5_2ypp1

Might be worth a shot. Better than just tossing it in the trash and buying a new phone.,LGG3,d6arv6f,2,t5_2ypp1

Im now using a Moto G thats similar in specs to my old G but has better battery life so far and no overheating.And it cost me  at best buy for the gb version. So happy I didnt break the bank. Works on all major carriers and the bootloader is unlockable just like my old G but officially! So no exploits needed!.LG was useless too you have to pay for a repair outside warranty so nothing I could do about the dead G except pay them more money for a repair or buy a G.,LGG3,d7ead03,1,t5_2ypp1

Edit I forgot  you do have to get the nanoSIM from them if you dont already have one. I have heard that some Verizon stores noncorporate ones might drag their feet on this play dumb or try to charge you but I had no trouble at my local corporate store.

8936635,0,t1_d7lj6lz,Okay so heres exactly what Ive done so far. At start I had d fulmics . xceed kernel with superSU and xposed framework.I started by unrooting with superSU and uninstalling xposed. After that boot to recovery and flash Magisk v blastagators boot bump and phhs superuser Magisk version in that order. Boot to system install Magisk manager and phhs superuser app unmount root in Magisk et voila  Pokemon Go .. launches on my phone. I ran into problems with first unrooting the first time I tried all of this supersu didnt unroot properly and left a file somewhere to fix this I uninstalled Magisk again then let twrp reinstall supersu and then immediately re ran the unroot in app. The second problem was that Magisk doesnt sign the boot image so I found blastagators boot bump which signed it and let the phone boot properlyMagisk v and phhs superuser blastagators boot bump under miscellaneous,LGG3,d7m1v3f,2,t5_2ypp1

Wifi is working great no boot loop..boot loop happens after  mins of wifi usage.seeing that it was a result of HEAT...now my phone works perfect. and the temps dont go higher than  degreesI even consider turning of the thermal throttling.because If its open it will cause lag and more heat. i dont know...now i have received a brand new original battery. It will be my mail batt.i dont play hell lots of games and stuff...This thermal mod is no joke. it is working GREAT..if you have any other solutions to fix a Wifi Bluetooth related hardware bootloop please tell me so i remove the thermal paste from my phone.Im very skeptical i didnt think this was gonna work....It worked great...

Ive given up and have ordered a Nexus P and am going to Google Fi.Nobody seems to know why this is happening. Try pulling the battery and restarting your phone. Might help for a little bit. See if it still does it when plugged in. Could be a weird battery effect but it doesnt make any difference on mine.Could try to get a new phone from your provider if youre on a plan and paid for it it through them. If not maybe get another one from ebay for pretty cheap. But yeah Ive been dealing with it for a few weeks and have reached the end of my rope.I did notice that if my phone is doing something where it needs the wifi continuously like playing Spotify yesterday then it will stay connected.
