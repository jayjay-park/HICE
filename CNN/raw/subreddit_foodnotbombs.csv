9538866,0,t3_5bgu1j,No! Immediate needs must be met first just to survive. It isnt enough just to throw a job at someone if they still have to sleep bathe eat go to the bathroom store their goods etc. in secure peace.The article addresses the critics of homeless alleviation within the first paragraph yet luckily turns it to a more rationale resolve.Yet the article also assumes that all homeless are mentally ill andor on drugs. As a traveling member of FNB and the NCH I can safely say over  of homeless have substance abuse issues possibly coupled with other issues like mental illness while  deal with mental health issues alone. That means there is a  who have suffered one continuous turn of unfortunate events after another with disenfranchisement and to make it worse they get wrongly labeled and aligned with the rest of the homeless. To assume that this particular small percentage of folks the ones quite capable of achieving their own selfempowerment at the right pace and with the resources and situations provided that work to the best of their specific means only got into their impoverished situation because of drugs or mental illness is an grotesque attempt to make apologetics for our systemone that continuously victimizes folks. It presumes our system of doing things is an unquestioned and perfect sacred science the very same way those pyramid schemes go about touting their waysafter all their system of doing things is not faulty or victimizingonly YOU causing the shortcoming.right?!. Yet if one were to show up in the political arena and say our system needs to be great again do you think they really are talking about making it a system that doesnt victimize anymore and helps a leg up to those who have been victmized? Guess again.,foodnotbombs,d9ov3vs,3,t5_2rwgm
