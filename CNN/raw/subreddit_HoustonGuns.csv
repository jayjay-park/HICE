2553199,0,t3_2oxagn,Makes me sad it is closing. But I have to say the staff had this elitist mentality. Acting like they know everything. Then when you call them out on where they were wrong they just get the other employee to agree with them and try to make you look stupid even tho they are wrong. I stopped bringing new people there.If you want to learn about guns go to Top Gun the staff is very friendly and very welcoming to new shooters.,HoustonGuns,cmru8zm,6,t5_31h14

4172336,0,t1_crvsaw7,Thanks for your reply. I never thought about putting all that info. My dad is  but hes still very active for his age. He grew up in a ranch and he has shot a rifle but thats about it I think. Neither of my brothers and I have ever touched a gun. I would say were interested in shooting with anything. Were in the downtown area so anywhere would be a good place ,HoustonGuns,crvuqpi,1,t5_31h14

Consider letting go what happened  years ago and giving it another shot.,HoustonGuns,d1366y9,4,t5_31h14
8346413,0,t1_d5kly7t,There were some made for the Indians in that caliber yes. There also were a bunch rechambered when they were imported. Its hard to tell the difference so Id rather just  have the original  British,HoustonGuns,d5kus52,1,t5_31h14
