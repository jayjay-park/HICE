It bothers me whenever we fight not because of that but its just me talking in the end. You never really give me an indication of what I say is ok or not. I cant tell if you care or not. Quite concerned if we cant argue properly.I dont think you know what I want. I say it but nothing changes. I cant tell myself if Im okay with the everyday...I just want some stimulation. Im not saying we should do everything everyday Im fine with chilling but I dont think its wrong to ask for a long conversation other than gaming. Thats what makes me happy other than like cuddling and such. I hate how I have to get this sort of fulfillment from someone else whether it be a councilor or online or offline friend.I dont know Ill just not bring anything up anymore. I give up. Im writing in here instead. I thought telling you whats wrong would make a difference. Now I know it doesnt and my words dont matter cause I think youre just making bs up statement just really kills it. I dont feel like I can express my troubles to you anymore. It was already hard enough. I cant do everything myself and with the state Im in now its harder on me not you. Yeah I probably ranted too much but I wonder if you would do something if you actually knew how sad I get often? You dont have to worry about social situations or anxiety attacks or what not. So dont pass judgment on me. I think you have it easier than me. You have a fam abeit stressful? that can take care of you friends you can talk to good grades and probably a better future than me?

Try explaining the word really to someone who has never heard it before. a lot of NonAmericans are very interested in coming to America or love it.That being said.  The US has been involved in some pretty shady business since its conception usually in cahoots with another nation who gets to sit in the back and laugh while we take the blame and the hate.  Why?

When the end comes it will come with Simon Cowell riding Ryan Secrest into battle along side Death Pestilence War and Famine.EditAs to answer you question why is Reality TV popularso abundant its because it is cheap.  And also the writers strike a few years ago.  Reality TV is scripted but not in a way that qualifies the writers to be members of the Screen Writers Guild.  So during the writers strike the only new content networks could produce was Reality programming.  Then they realized how incredibly cheap it is to make a show with no paid actors and what probably would have died quietly after the initial Survivor fever wore off grew into a booming soul crushing industry.  Also its not super new reality contests like American Idol have been around for decades starting with shows like Star Search.  In the end though as long as Reality TV continues to bring in tons of cash while remaining insanely cheap to produce it will exist.Edit Getting rid of cable helps immensely with forgetting Reality TV exists.,rant,cfvv4jv,2,t5_2qn2b

1543021,0,t1_cj9ollc,I ask this because I dont really consider tips any differently than commission. If you come in and sit in my section I want you to enjoy yourself. I want you to come back tomorrow and the day after and the day after that. I want repeat sales with you. I also am going to try and help you find things that you never knew you would like. I am going to get you to eat appetizers drink alcohol eat desert and feel like you are at home. My goal is to get you to trust me to guide you because really when you go out to eat you dont know shit about the stuff you are eatingusing you as a general term for customers here. I want you to be invigorated by the fact that that tequila you just drank was aged for  years in an oak barrel made from blue agave and goes down smooth. I dont want you to come in and eat I want you to come in and have an experience. However I have gone out to eat at tgichlibees and you get staff that works there and they dont care about that and I understand your gripe. If you want a different experience I urge you to branch out of cheap chain food places read some reviews and you will become a happier diner. I work on a commission on how much you trust me. That is what a tip is to me. Now I will say that not everyone is cut out to work this way and they dont make it for a long haul and they dont make good money doing it.I have worked behind a desk retail and in restaurants for  years. I have worked in chains vs. nonchain and always always always you will receive better service from people who are passionate about what they do.   ,rant,cj9owrm,3,t5_2qn2b

If youre going to give it away your parents at least need to deserve it. My sister makes a load of money and she pays my parents  a month? I dont remember. But that covers rent and everything. Plus our parents raised us well and gave us everything. When I start making money Im going to give my parents as much as I can while keeping a decent amount of money for myself. I want to be able to buy my parents a car not have them buy cars while not being able to afford it. Its not too late for your parents to change their habits.

You havent shown anything that shows propylene glycol is unsafe besides its restricted and it sounds bad which doesnt prove anything. Many normal food substances are regulated and restricted as well.     gtManufacturers are able to keep sweet treats moist for much longer than your local bakery thanks to propylene glycols characteristic as a hydroscopic meaning it can absorb and hold on to water from the air.    gtPropylene glycol acts as a grease without the calories it also helps margarine retain its shape once packed as well as maintain its creamy texture.    gtPropylene glycol in your cola acts as a flavor carrier and bacteria inhibitor making it an ideal component for soft drinks.    gtMany light ice cream get a hit of antifreezepropylene glycolthat wards off ice crystals keeping the product creamy and scoopable.    gtA powerful flavor carrier propylene glycol helps flavorings penetrate coffee beans.,rant,cloefid,2,t5_2qn2b

All those girls will be competing for the attention if a very small group of men who are basically perfect because there are no mitigating factors for the guys further down the scale like you and me. It basically inflates the value of any woman in the system so the average girls arent interested in the average guys. Thats understandable really and you shouldnt blame them. So what happens is that these perfect  guys fuck boatloads of women and the women cross their fingers and hope that FWBs turns into something more. It never does it never will everybody apart from the gorgeous guy is left unsatisfied.Just stop online dating is a load of wank it really is. Ive seen it grind more than one friends self worth into dust and its doing the same for you. Like them youre probably a decent guy whos not a supermodel but not a hambeast either. Any guy online who isnt a perfect  gets pretty much ignored  girls will tell you to smarten up your profile and send well thought out message but like you Ive suggested they pose as a man and see what its like.Just accept that its really really hard to meet women as an average guy in the modern western world. Its getting harder every day too because now guys are becoming afraid to approach strange girls for fear of creep shaming and being called a harasser. This isnt womens fault women didnt do this conciously women are still people  the system just fucks it up for everyone.My advice? Just foret about it go and and do things for you.

2643583,0,t1_cn3mhxn,Regarding dieting youre not wrong either  although there are feedback factors to consider. I believe it is the case that when you start taking in fewer calories than your body is used to your metabolism shifts into deprivation mode and slows. Also you start craving food more  I believe because we are conditioned to focus more on calories when weve experienced a sudden drop in intake. I dont have links to substantiate these beliefs they are based on readings done long ago. Anyway I know that dieting is controversial and scientific understanding continues to develop in this area so I will happily read any evidence that undermines these beliefs as well as evidence that substantiates them.But the fact that Whoopi Goldberg could do something is not enough to show that the ordinary Jane or John can do so too. Whoopi has a staff or can have a staff to help her out. Average folks dont. Whoopi can find emotional support in her social status. For some average folks the easiest and most reliable source of emotional support is a pint of ice cream. I think wed do better as society in addressing weight loss  as well as in addressing a lot of health problems  if we didnt rely so heavily on personal responsibility but also on the social and economic structure of our food system. But that means changes with big agriculture fast food places including the sitdown McFriendlys places like TGI Fridays and so on. I mean the political fights that have been waged over the FDAs food pyramid show just how much our nation is politically and economically invested in people continuing to eat garbage! ,rant,cn3nd7z,2,t5_2qn2b

2983680,0,t3_2ub5id,The bottom line is this like so many other areas of Reddit rfatpeoplehate is a place where miserable people can commiserate with other miserable people over a mutually agreed upon target that they have agreed is acceptable to pick on. If an adult with a life job responsibilities and human emotions has nothing better to do than cyber insult people they dont know then they should probably reevaluate their own choices. All the reasons they give for their hate are bullshit as well. If you think that obesity is the biggest threat to society or that any substantial amount of funding or resources is going toward supporting over weight people then you should read more. Also if you notice most of their animosity is not geared towards fat people its geared towards fat women.gt  Fat feminists come along and preach body positivty at killer sizes not just general overweight sizes. They try to strike men down tell them that they are brainwashed into thinking thin women are beautiful which is the real brainwashing in my opinion and tell them that Curvy codeword for fat is what they really want.As a casual observer most of Reddit seems filled with similar areas. Very antiwoman and full of unnecessary anger at things they have no control over and shouldnt really be so bothered by.

What about all the soft costs on society for accomidating this? That cost exists.If I get the choice between my future children being disabled or not you bet Im going to discriminate.

Possibly just birth control? in candy containers and Easter eggs. Very much flaunting the fact that she was even given them. Being on antidepressants is not fashionable. It isnt something to aspire to and I worry that that sort of behavior is conditioning young people to believe that they need to have some sort of mental or physical disorder in order to feel unique or important.

My mom tells me she agrees with me and tells me that she understands how I feel but doesnt defend me at all when my sister yells at me or actually do anything. I think thats quite depressing. Sometimes theyll hand me the phone with my dad on it and make me talk to him. I always fake happy and talk to him. I guess I fake my emotions too but everyone knows that I dont want to talk to him yet I just dont have the backbone to tell him. They always push me into being involved with him. But this time I really just dont want to. Its hard not to fight back when my sister starts yelling and screaming at me. Shes also very stubborn and told me about a week ago that shes always right when it comes to arguments especially ours. I disagree and that made me pretty upset. I dont feel like shed one day realize all of that and admire me for anything. Shes always been extremely stubborn that way. I hope she does realize it but I have my doubts. Overall I just want to move out and hope it all goes away. But eh. I just hate whats happening. I dont know if I can stay contact with her when Im older because although we understand and know each other the best this angry spurts of her are too often and just too emotional on me. There is no one in my life that brings about so much anger and pain like she does. Although I wish my family was better I wish a lot more about my sister. If she could just be nicer and less angry.

5671765,0,t3_3srbnv,Holy shit I almost had a panic attack reading this. I could never ever do that. Im struggling with two classes one with like no homework and a part time job. I have nervous twitches that have developed because of this. What you just described is pretty damn close to these crazy nightmares I have about school except what you described is worse.I am so sorry. I hope the knowledge that youre working your ass off is something. I mean truly I dont know many people who could do that. Have you gone to the dean of your department with this particular issue? I know you mentioned the passfail rate from the dean but I dont know if you talked about all of this. Or is there some other administrator there that you can contact? What about a counselor? If theres some kind of counselor maybe they can offer you SOME kind of helpful advice or resource? Exhaust any option you can to try and find even a few moments of relief. No one should live like that.Can you apply for scholarships? A . GPA is really fucking good. How old are you? There are grants for different things if you go back after a certain amount of time has passed Im just not sure how long you have to be out of school for that or if you could after having been on academic probation. I mean if you could take time off from school to recharge and manage to make a living in that time frame do that? I know that idea probably sucks because it sounds like you are super driven to do this. Dont become ill over it though. Its not worth it. You deserve a good quality of life just like anyone else does.I dont know. I am so sorry. Enjoy that Whataburger like its your last meal and have as good of a birthday as you possibly can.,rant,cx04zvy,2,t5_2qn2b
5672575,0,t1_cx04zvy,Thanks I appreciate it.On scholarships the ones Ive found have all been really small.  here   there and half of them are stuff I dont even qualify for.The silver lining is my tuition for university is relatively low I think its like  an academic year. At just two years there Im looking at  to . Not low enough to pay out of pocket but it could have a dent in it with some scholarships. Still I havent found anything I qualify for that sounds really good.On the advisers Ive talked to everyone. Ive let my professors know in the hopes theyll show some mercy since I cant just take the class next semester like everyone else. When I first spoke to my adviser she told me to strongly consider not attending college. Spoke to her again after my first semester perfect GPA at that point and she told me again to consider dropping out. So she isnt terribly helpful.Talked to the financial aid office yesterday and asked the guy about the policy and he said Yep you gotta pass those classes or find a way to pay for school. Asked if there was a way to get out of it and he chuckled a little before saying no.The little Ive spoken to the Dean has amounted to Get tutoring then. Its STEM so its competitive. Im up to  hours of tutoring this semester and over  since I started school.From my view private scholarships are my best option but again there arent a lot of big payday options out there for generic white male middle class programmers with few talents or hardships I have Tourettes syndrome but havent found a good scholarship for that.Ill put a nice candle in my whataburger. ,rant,cx08m8q,3,t5_2qn2b

I recently just moved to a new town near him so it is going to take a while for me to make new friends etc.   Was hoping to be able to spend some time with my friend of nearly two decades but I only saw him once since Ive been here.Im kinda glad we werent to the point of marriage and I found out before we even got into a relationship.  It hurts that the one person I thought would never hurt me that I thought would never lose who I tried so hard to keep a friend all these years is now a stranger in my life.I tried so hard to stay friends because I knew he had commitmentdating issues but stupid me...thought because we have always longed for each other he wouldnt let his own insecurities get in the way of something great.I kept trying to say nice things about him too even good things about the problem he couldnt change about himself which was superficial to me.

5832759,0,t1_cxk6zk9,Negative. I compared the intimidation felt between a child and an adult to the intimidation felt between a woman and a manThat does not mean women are children and have no agency.It simply means they are smaller physically weaker and have all the mental set backs that come with those things WHEN ALONE with a stronger male.This is true all across the animal kingdom as well. Even dogs bears and even lions submit to the physically stronger. They allow themselves to be dominated and become submissive as a survival mechanism  youve probably seen this when a dog rolls onto its backWomen have this same survival mechanism built into their brain. Its not active . Im not saying theyre completely helpless all the time or every time theyre alone but often when theyre alone with a physically intimidating man it is simply in their nature to be submissiveAnd that can be submitting to his desires for sex without even wanting toIts a little more complicated than just big vs small which is why a smaller grown man is more likely to stand up to a larger grown manBut thats going a little deeper than I want to go.Suffice it to say intimidation and the natural instinct to be submissive in the face of said intimidation and aggressive behavior play a huge role With that said Im talking about when are ALONE WITH A MANIf theres even one other person in the room it could change everything. The woman could feel more bold and brave and be more willing to speak up if she has even the slightest back up or someone who might help protect her.so women certainly have agency. They just need to stay in groups.Being alone with a man that wants them is like me being alone with a UFC fighter that wants me. Terrifying ,rant,cxk79no,4,t5_2qn2b

6402717,0,t3_43d66n,Maybe you should stop posting shit to FB anytime something annoys you? I mean how old are you that you need to post something online and claim its venting? What I dont understand is why people feel others give a shit if a bars music is too loud or if it rocks too much for your taste after the sun goes down. I see people mostly female posting mundane useless bullshit all the time and its meaningless vapid dribble.  Also if I asked one of my employees to stop posting work related stuff online and she counters me that she didnt implicate my company and becomes defensive instead of replying with an affirmative she would not be an employee for long. Even if you didnt specifically implicate your place of employment you should be cognizant and use better judgement when you rant to social media about your place of employment or how your bosses behave. Stop posting all the time and be happy youre employed. Or quit and post about that bar all the time those are your options.,rant,czhfa0o,35,t5_2qn2b

6466561,0,t1_czo697l,The advice you are giving is really old fashioned and really only works in a small company. Making friends with coworkers is probably a good idea but only your mgr controls your advancement. In my situation there are people who work in my building maybe  are in the same field and maybe  are managers. I only need to impress those  and be friendly with the other . Making friends with coworkers is nice but coworkers are like college classmates they change and move on and they wont stick their neck out for you ever. A far more useful strategy is to become friendly with everyone but avoid becoming friends with anyone as that invites drama. Move around and prove yourself valuable with your skills. If you hang around anywhere too long you become stale and youll get passed over continuously.And related but I work hrs a day everyday. Its a waste of my life to spend hr or hr a day chatting.

This is a sexual orientation like gay or bisexual not a gender identity.Just because you dont agree with them doesnt mean they dont exist. Being transgender isnt something tumblr made up.

I think my problem is bluewhite light. In the morning I have been waking up to whitewarm colors but once I go down stairs the light is more bluewhite. It is also the most problematic that is easily reflected off of snow so its well worth a try to block.I wish I could have separate prescription glasses with polarized lenses but quite frankly I would prefer at least to have Transition lenses again they worked great. I miss them. Not  to stop migraines but they could be used more widely. Wider uses are more cost effective. I prefer fewer glasses to keep track of because I have handy little ones that are still working on leaving things alone.Thank you for the information I hope you find another filter to further eliminate your migraines!Edit I bit the bullet and got some polarized clip on sunglasses. I figured  for clip ons is cheaper than  for copays on my sumatriptan refills. Im down to two pills and I would like to stave off getting a refill as long as possible. Thank you.

The smart ones act very feminine and needy but inside they are real killers. The person who came up with the expression the weaker sex was either very naive or had to be kidding. I have seen women manipulate men with just a twitch of their eye  or perhaps another body part. From Vanity Fair  When a man leaves a woman especially when it was perceived that he has left for a piece of assa good one! there are  percent of the population who will love the woman who was left.. From a  Esquire article You know it really doesnt matter what the media write as long as youve got a young and beautiful piece of ass. New York Magazine article from  Women?

Today for most kids  college is a place to go party make friends and maybe learn something about the world. I think most students want a better understanding of the world but I dont think college is fulfilling that wish. Having a system in place with quotas pushes people into programs they are disinterested in and hence people get lost in college instead of finding answers. Employers arent any better they just want to see a piece of paper its a prereq for employment. Why does it need to be this way?

The same thing would happen if lefthanded people complained too. Anyone frustrated at having to now put forth even a little effort to accommodate a group of people they before didnt have to consider might start to hate that group of people. They would say Well it never bothered you before! and would want to go back to the days where they didnt have to care.

Why they exist I cannot even begin to explain.Kids playing with their toys is not entertainment. Channels showing daytoday family life is not entertainment. Not even challenge channels qualify in my opinion. There is nothing challenging about a couple of siblings or friends playing an overlong extremely simple game.You know what the problem is? The vast majority of YouTubers have transitioned from being actual creators carefully planning out every aspect of their videos and deciding whether they will even work in the first place to just submitting anything with the camera rolling. Most of YouTube is reality television now. Just turn on the camera spend  minutes doing barely anything of interest give it a clickbait name and misleading thumbnail upload it and watch the views and subscribers pour in. People will watch that shit because the kids of today that watch YouTube have been tricked into believing that the above is the best people can do.Im sure someone will say to me But YouTube was always like that but I disagree back in the day YouTube was full of great content and the bad stuff was pushed to the wayside except for Fred though a lot of people hated Fred I think people just subscribed to him out of pity.

The only time she ever got her nose out of joint was when he flirted just a bit too hard with someone like a bartender or waitress. My Dad he likely never strayed was way against people who did. But he loved to flirt. Hed let my Mom flirt too but she just wasnt as into it. Some people though they can be very uptight about this kind of thing apparently. The way I see it so long as its just looking and flirting its fine. Theres a line and so long as you dont cross it I dont think getting outraged is necessary. But your partner just looking at pics and you flipping your lid? Thats a serious sign of insecurity I think. Temperamental DivaDivo territory for sure....,rant,d5hh768,1,t5_2qn2b

And kill them wherever you find them andexpel them from wherever they have expelled youand fitnah Persecution is worse than killing. Anddo not fight them at alMasjid al Haramuntil they fight you there. But if they fight you then kill them. Such is the recompense of the disbelievers.And if they cease then indeed God is Forgiving and Merciful.Fight them until there is no more fitnah Persecutionand until worship is for God.

8344875,0,t3_4ttfnk,No one gonna say it? Ill be the asshole downvotes ahoy.... The Key word is limit not you have to be going this fast. Most states have the limit set and then have a rule of not impeding the flow of traffic for the minimum and some areas have posted minimums. If your passing your not legally allowed to go over the speed limit as its the limit. Technically about  under is where they engineer the speeds to be followed. Not only that but many vehicles like your box van can be hit by wind and other things that make the handling more difficult or concerning at higher speeds.Ultimately you shouldnt be trying to always go as fast as you can you want to safely move within the flow of traffic. Doing so means its safer for everyone and we all come home in our cars instead of a box or bag depending on speed.Look If your not getting to where you need to go just leave earlier. We all have to drive on these roads and cars are just wildly more dangerous than all the things we hear on the news about guns and shit. We just have bad awareness of risk.  We all are safer if we all are courtious and stay with the flow.. Going faster braking suddenly or stopping or speeding up to let people in or block them are all things that cause accidents and traffic jams. Its better to have smooth movements of speed increases and decreases with no braking and ample room in front of and behind the vehicle. I understand that its frustrating as fuck but thats how it works. Plan accordingly give room and dont try to push traffic if its flow is slower than you want it to be. ,rant,d5knvx7,2,t5_2qn2b

It sounds like your sister is being a big hypocrite for criticizing you though and I have noticed that my harshest critics are actually people that struggled with finding a job in the past themselves. I think people just want to find a way to feel superior to another person due to their own insecurities... Oh and I definitely feel you on the frustration with your dad wanting you to be a cop. For some reason a lot of people think I should be a teacher but I dont have a teaching license and I really dont want to be a teacher. Sure I have a bachelors degree and could go substitute teach while working on my license but I really really dont want to be a teacher. I also have people that want me to be a programmer  and I actually tried to do it. More specifically I tried to be a web developer and even did a short month program to train to become one. But lets be real here... programming is very hard. At the rate I am going its going to be a LONG time before I am ready to actually have a job as a programmer. I also dont really want to do it  not just because I am being stubborn and unwilling to work hard  I just dont think I am the right type of person for the field.

Second of all blue screens vary in what causes and they can usually be fixed by replacing corrupted or missing Windows system files.

They often go for someone who quits  weeks later and then they come calling back or just never call and you never know why because it makes no sense.

10429791,0,t3_5pd1a8,ONE if you need to preface what youre going to say with this is not to offend anyone it means that you know that theres something offensive being said. Youre acknowledging it and continuing to say it anyway. No one ever intends to offend anyone most of the time but they dont prefix everything they say with that.TWO this is actually a really common fear of people which is why its been very difficult in terms of transgender rights and acceptance of trans individuals. People used to and still have similar fears about openly gay people being in their presence. Your friend might have been startled but as long as nobody got hurt other than maybe the possible pain of rejection I dont see any harm.Saying this will most likely be seen as SJW propaganda but its important to remember transgender people are in a difficult spot where they face challenges in both their assigned gender role and their transgender identity. You get to walk away. That transgender person gets to be rejected on the grounds of their gender identity which is something thats really shitty if you think about it. Everyone has the choice to walk away and reject someone theyre not into obviously but it affects transgender people in a markedly different way. That isnt to say you shouldnt have that choice at all just when you make realize the dynamics at play. Essentially let bygones be bygones or dont make a scene either works.

11565107,0,t1_dg6iko7,You can still be a lawyer and go to community college. Also with enough effort you can be anything you want to be.  If you dont want to put in the effort thats on you.  But anyone can put in effort and while for some itll be a slight uphill stroll and for others it will be boulder climbing in broken flip flops you can get there.I would not do acting. Acting is all about connections. I know people who graduated from NYU in their theatre department that are servers because they simply didnt understand that its not just talent that gets you into that industry.  If youre really dead set on it minor in it or get a bachelors in something profitable and then get an associates in acting.  You sound like youre pretty young.  Youll get over this feeling soon. Talk a community college counselor and see if they can help you get on the right track to doing what you want to do.  Let them guide you dont be so dead set on something.    ,rant,dg6wruz,2,t5_2qn2b

Even in my high school there were a lot of varsity athletes who were pretty mediocre for high school athletes but they were the best the school could get. The teams would lose most of their games during the season.But hey its OK. They were varsity and walked around in their letterman jackets like they owned the place.

Itll take time and theres no telling how long but you will move on. Its not going to be easy and its not abnormal if youre still hung up on her after you think you should be.

11719608,0,t3_6789r2,Calm down. Women smell desperation like a shark scents blood in the water. Except woman do not find desperation attractive. If you want a GF you need to do three things. determine the type of girl you want. Is any woman fine or do you want a girl with certain traits i.e class level intelligence level attractiveness level. Be honest about what you want or expect.Determine where to meet that type of girl. You are not gonna meet an intelligent upper middle class College educated sexually modest woman at AM in a cheap nightclub where the average woman has more tattoos than you do.Become the type of guy that specific kind of woman is interested in.Reality Check women prefer partners who they consider equal or higher in status. So if you earn less than the type of girl youre interested in. Are in a lower social group or are unable to provide her the things shes accustomed to receiving you will not get the girl.You are  so you still have time. Improve yourself physically. Being fit will improve your chances over the lazy couch potato. Seek opportunities to improve your financial situation. further your studies focus on in office training etc dont focus short term think long term.If youre healthy and wealthy the women will come.,rant,dgog2ka,7,t5_2qn2b
