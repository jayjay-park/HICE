I would disagree with the other comment and say that movements like BLM are in fact part of the class struggle. In the US at least there is a connection between racial oppression and class oppression. They may not be revolutionary in the Marxist sense but they do have a place imo.,marxism_101,d38l5w3,3,t5_3avj0

9280621,0,t1_d8sdn9s,Yes but they are usually often selfemployed not wagelaborers. And they often hire some wagelaborers secretaries etc.Edit Looking up some stuff I do think I have a partial answer though. gtPetit bourgeoisie are those who work and can afford to buy little labour power i.e. small business owners peasant landlords trade workers et al. Marxism predicts that the continual reinvention of the means of production eventually would destroy the petit bourgeoisie degrading them from the middle class to the proletariat.Not that I agree but it gives me a partial answer.,marxism_101,d8sdw3u,2,t5_3avj0
10088603,0,t3_5k6ah0,Marxists say it but that doesnt mean Marx has said it. These Marxists are just summarizing Marxs ideas.Marx believed the state is the government of the class in power used to oppress the lower classes. During the anticapitalist revolution the working class will use a state to oppress the bourgeois in the same way the state was once used to oppress the working class. This revolutionary state is known as the Dictatorship of the Proletariat. Engels writes that socialism will be stateless because in socialism all classes will no longer exist thus the state has no more use. If a state is built to oppress a class it will now dissolve without a class to oppress. The state will then become an organization or technically a government used to organize society. ,marxism_101,dbmk8ve,1,t5_3avj0

They go into the topic with their own biases and dont look any further just as long as it appears to correspond to a couple of tenet that they might have. So rather than see this as a what it really is an ethnic war of liberation where the working class has been forced by the circumstances to take on the management of their own subjugation against an enemy thats been equated to fascism it is now Catalonia for the st century.   ,marxism_101,ded4ao7,9,t5_3avj0

11612931,0,t1_dg91bqm,gt om his own company that still represents money he is getting from the capital he owns.If a little entrepreneur employ workers as cleaners for a wage. As the owner he gets the dividends. But if he also is a cleaner and works in the exact same conditions as the others cleaners for the same wage the fact that he owns the company makes his wage something else than a wage ?,marxism_101,dgcc3d8,0,t5_3avj0
11631398,0,t3_65zl4c,The concept which the author is probably referring to is the following based on his referencegt The cooperative factories of the labourers themselves represent within the old form the first sprouts of the new although they naturally reproduce and must reproduce everywhere in their actual organisation all the shortcomings of the prevailing system. But the antithesis between capital and labour is overcome within them if at first only by way of making the associated labourers into their own capitalist i.e. by enabling them to use the means of production for the employment of their own labour. They show how a new mode of production naturally grows out of an old one when the development of the material forces of production and of the corresponding forms of social production have reached a particular stage. Without the factory system arising out of the capitalist mode of production there could have been no cooperative factories. Nor could these have developed without the credit system arising out of the same mode of production. The credit system is not only the principal basis for the gradual transformation of capitalist private enterprises into capitalist stock companies but equally offers the means for the gradual extension of cooperative enterprises on a more or less national scale. The capitalist stock companies as much as the cooperative factories should be considered as transitional forms from the capitalist mode of production to the associated one with the only distinction that the antagonism is resolved negatively in the one and positively in the other.Ive bolded the important part.  It cannot really be contested that Marx believed one mode of production gives rise to another and in that sense the seeds so to speak of the new system are developed in the old.  However there are bigger issues with the accuracy of the statement overall one which seems like what is essentially apologetic for cooperatives as a transitional form.  Not the least of these problems is that the transitional society is incoherent as a Marxian concept ,marxism_101,dgefjlf,2,t5_3avj0
11758201,0,t1_dgat80s,Up to a point yes? There has to be a line somewhere. Im really conflicted.You see I live in Israel unfortunately though Im hoping to expatriate given the opportunity and I hear that its actually the military that stands today as the main gateway to the IT industry which is pretty much the biggest thing in the country. If you serve in some prestigious unit perhaps with a focus on software engineering such as Mamram or GAMA you should have no trouble finding a good job.On the one hand Im  already the clock is ticking and I need to make a move. The military route has advantages over the academic route. I would be gaining work experience instead of wasting time on the inessential theory of CS courses and I wouldnt have to pay for it would actually be even paid a little myself could get a lowerinterest mortgage benefits schmenefits etc.. On top of it I wouldnt have to deal with the Israelispecific stigma of not serving in the military which may come up both on a personal level and in employment situations.On the other hand I would find it dishonorable to serve in any bourgeois military let alone the Israeli military  the worst bastions of reaction that they are rivaled only by the Church and the countryside! As a communist I would be embarrassed for the rest of my life to have to confess to people nonIsraeli people at least that I was in the IDF even if in a purely noncombatant role.Whats the right thing to do?,marxism_101,dgstlmw,1,t5_3avj0
