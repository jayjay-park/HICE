9921035,0,t3_5h7pjj,It sounds like you need to draw up a quick document that outlines the service that they want you to hire. As long as its crystal clear what your role and responsibilities are I think that would help.You should clearly label what is In Scope of your contract and what is Out of Scope.I would schedule a meeting to review this specifically. You should then spend part of meeting reviewing the items that are out of scope i.e. maintenance and clearly communicate what the risk and impact is should the critical systems fail. They can then make a decision and you can clearly articulate the meeting in minutes as a follow up.If you want to formalise it further you could get them to sign the document.Usually when people are asked to sign something it forces them to really understand the potential implications of the situation.,freelanceuk,db0qi0t,1,t5_2xqtq
