9029754,0,t3_53xzj1,Its hard to say because the rewards are definitely better but youll also very likely be going up against much more challenging decks. Its a lot harder to win events in the higher tiers. At the end of the event almost every player in the platinum tier top ten has a perfect score no battles or side objectives missed. Also you can have a level  walker and still get matched against a level  walker in every single battle.Id recommend hanging out in the lower tier until you have your walkers fully leveled and the cards to go up against top ranked players.,MTGPuzzleQuest,d7x8fm3,1,t5_39r4f

9558790,0,t3_5bgnno,My favourite commonuncommon card combo is Grovetender Druids  Valor in Akros. Grovetenders Rally ability is to drain  mana and summon a  Plant Token. Valor in Akros gives all your creatures  until the end of your turn whenever a creature you control enters the battlefield.So with those on the board say you fire off Ally Gideons second ability to summon   Ally Knights. You get  An  White Ally Knight   on your Plant token   to all your three creatures until the end of your turn!  Thats a total of  with  being permanent. Do the same trick with Oath of Gideon and its  instead still great. Run Haunted Cloak for Haste to deal damage using your newly summoned and boosted units. Run Allied Reinforcements to have an Ally Knight without summoning sickness by the time you trigger Ally Gideons second ability.My favourite rare combo is no longer all that powerful due to the power creep in the game but I still like it cause it carried me through half the time that Ive played this game and still features in my Koth deck. Thats Embermaw Hellion  Iroass Champion.Its  mana for a total of  damage per turn thanks to Iroass Double Strike synergising with Embermaws . That was a pretty strong powertomana ratio back in Origins and still pretty decent through BFZ and OGW. Embermaws ability can benefit your third creature too if its Red so coupled with say Volcanic Rambler which is a solid midrange ramp creature you dish out  damage a turn. Or you might be using Reckless Bushwhacker for the mass Haste to get rid of summoning sickness and attack pronto.,MTGPuzzleQuest,d9rbfgg,1,t5_39r4f

10405318,0,t1_dcmthel,Glad I could help man. A couple more pieces of advice though.First you absolutely need to get rid of Natural Connection and replace it with Animists Awakening. Its a MUCH better card.Second as uspanargoman mentioned the Managorger Hydra isnt all that great. I would consider replacing it with a couple other cards listed here in my order of preference Metalwork Colossus This card is FAR better than the Hydra. Its a natural blocker with  times the health and damage and if you cast it with Kioras second ability and Mirrorpool on the board you will drop a  steelreinforced brick wall on top of your opponent. Any of the following for added draw in order of my personal preference Glimmer of Genius Trail of Evidence Elemental Bond Tezzerets Ambition Pore Over the Pages Bomat Courier Any of the following for a bit more control in order of my personal preference Anchor to the Ether Adverse Conditions Claustrophobia Gone Missing Just the WindTLDR Replace Natural Connection with Animists Awakening and Managorger Hydra with Metalwork Colossus.,MTGPuzzleQuest,dcnider,2,t5_39r4f

10998959,0,t3_5x26h7,A lot of the PWs are of marginal value but I think that everyone should own a maxlevel Nahiri Kiora and Ob.  Between those three you have all five colors covered and can do pretty much any objective and Nahiri is the queen of QB Koth is second place.J L and Koth are pretty good though even though Koth gets mostly replaced by Nahiri since she can do the same things he can but faster.  Dovin is another great PW for doing objectives.  Sorin and Sarkhan are useful but not as critical.As far as card packs it really depends what your collection looks like.  If youre missing a ton of key cards get some packs but Id wait for SoI or BfZ to come back since Origins has mostly been made obsolete with a few exceptions by power creep and KLD mostly sucks except for a handful of key cards almost all mythics and a few rares.

The odds of rerolling till you get something useful is so low youre better off staying on the same account and opening more hour free boosters.Theres a little bit of information the Tips amp Guides  forum on the official forums from the latest topics but the pinned guides are mostly outdated.For the moment the best way of getting information is through joining a good coalition or joining the Slack chat as the others suggested. In any case try to join a coalition as soon as possible so that you can reap coalition rewards for coalition events.If youve any immediate questions I can try to answer them here or link you to relevant past topics.Regarding planeswalkers you will need different coloured ones for certain events. Of the basic  costing  Crystals I would recommend to get Chandra Liliana and Gideon to enable you to participate more in the events. While Blue is the only colour that is in all events Jace Telepath Unbound is the worst planeswalker in the game and so should be avoided imo.Participating in Events will allow you to earn more Progression and Ranking rewards to help progress more quickly in the game.
