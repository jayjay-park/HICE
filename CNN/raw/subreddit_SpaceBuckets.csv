278435,0,t3_1xap5n,DThis grow is going along great for a first time...This plant was started December th in paper towels and moved to soil  days later. Im TOTALLY guessing but it is about  weeks veg it could be  because I cant remember totally...I have been using the fox farms trio and topped her once pulled off  secondaries to be used as hopeful clones.Currently it sits with  fan leaves  main tops and  secondaries. The two main tops will lead to more secondaries that I will decide to deal with later.Most excitedly I will be flipping it  tonight...I have been practicing the LST technique and I am sold so far this plant will be grown in a   spacer spacebucket and will be a VERY minimal grow of which Im hoping for  grams dry from. Pruned off  of the first fan leaves since they were mostly dead.LMK what you guys think!!,SpaceBuckets,cf9meyb,3,t5_2v4n2

I found som ceramic sockets but they are not pre wired and the screws are the same color so started feeling chicken shit again about wiring myself. I couldnt find any of those sockets with a plug but I remember buying a couple last year wich went poof the first time I plugged them in. I did find one of those old builders torches but alas only one. It doesnt say how many watts it will take but these things were made to use with incandescent bulbs so I would think a w at least. And I found a Ysplitter but that said only w max.So I caved and orderd one of those bulb lamps withe a fuse and plug and will have to wait another  weeks to build my bucket. In the mean time Im going to set up a temporary bucket with the torch I have to unscrew the reflector hood w cfl an old fan and some old plant pots I have as a bucket. Its small but If I start to veg now I can be ready to flower with more cfl when the real bucket is ready...I hope!Thanks again!,SpaceBuckets,ckyxz5h,1,t5_2v4n2

2224691,0,t1_clm7fat,Well its a relatively simple concept. It must be in a seperate environment since the pollen is sneaky and wants to fertilize every beautiful female it can find. . The pollen sacs develop and will eventually release it into the air via a breeze and will fall below if in a wind free environment. You could tap it onto a card and then sprinkle it onto a select few bottom buds that you want seeds from. Of course when the plant is ready white pistils is a good indicator. There are millions of sperm in the sacs like our mammal sacs. Brushing it all on is overkill since one ovary needs one sperm. Sterility is key dont want to give her a STD. Thats pretty much the process. Good way to multiply your worth. It will not be sexed naturally produced seeds will be bred from the genetics of the two seeds. If you wanted to keep Northern Lights OG you would need a male and female of it.If you wanted female seeds from a single female silver water has been used. I read a a guys blog of his methods. Lots of money and time but if you have a favorite and its flame.. you have you try to keep its genetics pure.,SpaceBuckets,clmm1f3,1,t5_2v4n2

3029039,0,t1_cobugua,I am using the Stellarnet GreenWave spectrometer Vis model Slit. Ive got a uM fiber optic cable cosine lens and a  degree lens. With NIST traceable calibration its a  package. The  degree lens is mainly used for chlorophyll fluorescence measurements I tend to take nm ratio measurements if I can. I take photos of my laptop screen because all photos have an automatically copyright and I dont lose the copyright as per Reddits current TOS this apples for the entire lighting guide and I want to make them low quality enough to be useful but not high enough quality where people are going to be ripping off the photos for commercial purposes. The program is called  SpectraWiz Spectroscopy Software which comes with the spectrometer and does allow professional quality screen shots. In that set up damn thats expensive! In PM last week someone gave me a link to that cart I definitely would be using  or ten watt LEDs because you need to create an even area light source rather than a spot or linear light source a large soft box used in studio photography up close would be an area light source. This is pretty essential for taking nice pics of dark wine bottles for example. They appear to using multiple linear light sources a T fluorescent tube is a linear light source and putting them next to each other to create an area light source.  watt LEDs are too much of spot light sources to be used in the example you showed unless a bunch were used very under driven which doesnt make sense for this application.I have a real basic rule that I use for the heat sink temperature taken right behind the LED. Ideally I want to be able to keep my finger on the heat sink for  seconds comfortably and at that point Im at  degrees F  C. This is what I always shoot for. My do not exceed point is being able to keep my finger on the heat sink for one second which is  degrees  C. I actually use a FLIR E thermal camera when working with heat sinks  Again I take a photo of the thermal camera screen to preserve copyright when posting thermal shots online. I keep all power electronics temperature down low enough where I wont get burned. Ive gotten nd degree burns off of power transistors before some which are designed to run as high as  degrees C.,SpaceBuckets,cobyhat,2,t5_2v4n2

Here I drew a pic so you could visualize Obviously the detail isnt as good as possible but I did the best I could in  hours of work. As you can see your space bucket SB feeds into your first Carbon filter CF  which then gets the odor.

The stomata pretty much close in darkness so theres very little humidity build up.

5343454,0,t1_cvukyrp,Your TDS meter is ppm  EC  instead of ppm there is a slight difference between TDS Total Dissolved Solids and EC Electrical Conductivity but doesnt matter here. Remember this number so you can also give the EC number! Meters can range from about ppm  EC .  degrees C is actually pretty ideal.I use a  ratio of the green brown and pink solutions but at higher lighting levels I need that extra nitrogen even in flowering. You should stick with the label instructions until your problems are solved and then change as needed. To tackle a problem like this you want to only change one parameter at a time.Switch the micronute solution brown to the hard water versionDefinitely check the runoff ppm particularly if you have never flushed. That can very well be the problem particularly at higher temperatures because your plant is going to use more water from transpiration so there could be more salts left in your soil. With these strong fertilizers you should always have an idea of the runoff pH and ppm.gtwhat ppm should I be hitting at each stage?This can be very much strain specific which will also depend on lighting levels and temperature. I hit a plant hard until I notice the leaf tips just starting to turn white and then I back off a little. The white which can turn brown if pushed harder is called tip burn and is due to osmosis from the higher salt content in the rest of the leaf. In leaf crops like lettuce calcium can be added to prevent tip burn and still push a plant hard. You likely already have a lot of calcium naturally in your water.,SpaceBuckets,cvuooux,1,t5_2v4n2

Your pot is perfect right now for the vegetative stage It keeps the plant at a size where it can manage itself roots are predictable. I would keep it inside of the pot youre using now until you establish a time to go into the Flowering cycle. For example my set up if youre going to be switching your lights to a  cycle on Monday replant into the new pot as early Sunday as possible so that the plant can adjust to the new container repair and absorb in nutrients while still on the vegetative cycle  hours of light per my set up. This should minimize the shock to the plant.So far youre pretty on par for the course old seeds or not.

6510730,0,t3_44rx62,As long as the plant gets at least  hours of dark itll stay in flower. Even if a night is cut short by half an hour the plant should still press on. The plant triggers flower phase once nights are consecutively longer meaning that if your plant in veg phase gets one night thats  hours long it wont instantly and automatically flip to flower. It needs multiple long nights in a row for flower to kick in. The opposite is also true...once the plant starts getting shorter nights and longer days theres a chance itll flip back into veg phase but one random shorter night wont mess everything up If your lights were on for an extra  min set the ON setting to be the original setting  minutes and keep the OFF setting the same.

Growing in a rental is extremely risky in my opinion as your landlord could pop in after a  hour notice.  If you own it maybe you could ask them if they would be okay with you putting a space bucket in the garage?  As long as you kept it well ventilated it may not even be noticeable.  If you are in a rental and your roommates arent okay with it I would suggest trying a guerilla grow.

I personally dont feel you should need to buy liquid fertilizers as a healthy soil with lots of microbes utilizing compost tea and natural elements can achieve similar if not better yields. I mean you can argue with me but there are lots of people who realize bottled fertilizers are just an easy way of feeding plants without too much thought. they cause salt buildups and are very pricey for what they are. but oh well this is for others to read and figure out. they will see that I am right when it comes to true soil.,SpaceBuckets,d8fh8ri,-1,t5_2v4n2

I use a relay board from eBay wired into the Arduino to trigger it.Also if you do use a soil sensor make sure you dont have it on all the time. Doing so will corrode the terminals and cause metals to be deposited in the soil as well. Use a MOSFET or relay to turn on power to the sensor wait  seconds then take readings.

10588960,0,t3_5rl4ix,Hey man sorry you are running into issues. What sorts of ppm are you giving these ladies? I get a lot of conflicting info about coco and testing runoff. However I like to test the runoff once a week or so to see if I should start throttling the ppmIt sounds like the issues you are having are different between different plants. IMO maybe you should try to treat them separately too. Can you clarify how many plants and which symptoms on each?Maybe also take a sample of your coco from the pot put it in a solo cup add some ro water if you have some leftover mix it let it sit for a while then test the pH. This should give you a better idea what the pH is at your roots.Lastly given that youve checked basically everything I wonder if your root system is healthy. Im not sure how to check tbh these were from seed?Anyway this is my first coco run so as with most posts on here YMMV,SpaceBuckets,dd864oy,1,t5_2v4n2

11076913,0,t3_5y5jqz,Here comes an essay of an answer.Yes its better to run the chip softer for a few reasons. The first couple you mentioned heat and longevity and another is for increased efficiency. LEDs produce  things from the power you put through them photons and heat. Typically the less power you put into the chip the higher your photon to heat ratio will be. If you run a chip at half of its maximum current  of that power might be converted to light. If you run the chip closer to max you might get  of that converted to light instead with the rest being wasted as heat.Your method of deriving current will definitely get you close enough but isnt completely accurate. LEDs are sort of weird when it comes to voltage and current because they are nonohmic and each LED has its own special currentvoltage relationship. Small changes of voltage produce large changes in current and vice versa. Even though your specs for that chip call for V drive voltage at  volts it might only draw mA but at  volts it might draw mA. So the problem is its impossible to know what voltage to divide your power by without seeing the data sheet. In this case we could probably guess that if youre running the chip at  power the voltage should be roughly halfway between the minimum  and maximum  so we could call it V. Current would then be  .A. As I said your guess is close enough but I felt like writing this out for the hell of it.That LED driver you linked should work fine. On your next question which type of ACDC adapter are you talking about? The V adapter youre talking about sounds like its constant voltage which at V will cause major problems with that chip. The chip will try to draw a shitload of current and will probably kill your power supply unless it has some sort of currentlimiting circuitry. Stick with a constant current LED driver that can output its rated current in a range that your chips voltage falls within.Now heat sinks. That heat sink you linked is too small. For  watt passive Id look for a pinfin that can dissipate at least .W  of W. Not sure if you can get stuff from cutter online but here is the closest I could find to your requirements on a quick search I picked cutter since its close to you but if youre ordering online anyway there are a lot of options. Also whatever you do dont paint your sink.One more thing to add  Im not sure if the KK color temperature in your link is what youre thinking of getting but I would get something K or K instead. K is too blue for a full cycle. K will get you from veg through flower.Edit Wow when I started typing this there were no other comments! At least were all saying the same thing D,SpaceBuckets,denk3lz,2,t5_2v4n2
11082983,0,t3_5y8b0r,What is your light source and how far is it away?What is your soil? Did you mistakenly give it nutes?Did you put the seedling right into the bigger pot?
