324605,0,t1_cfe2d5i,Yeah they didnt announce it but it is available... as a standalone app which you have to use to listen to it.Pretty disappointing honestly.,killzone,cfeezf5,2,t5_2ru72

476604,0,t3_1zkau5,You should you need the achievements and that player is more accomplished. Them being the class with the setup they choose is very likely going to make ot easier to win as they have more experience. Although you both should realistically your reasoning is a little silly.,killzone,cfufxyl,4,t5_2ru72
530623,0,t3_205h35,I understand where you are coming from and why you ask but this is Killzone. There is a reason your KD ratio isnt even shown in the game. I guess you would get a better response if you ask for mature players that are playing for fun while still being competitive in rPSNFriends.Personally when I see such requests asking about KD ratios I instantly discard them.,killzone,cg0l7j4,0,t5_2ru72

895570,0,t3_240gc4,Its a visual bug only BTW. Your unlocks and everything else are safe it just shows up as locked in the menu. Fix on its way.,killzone,ch62wt7,1,t5_2ru72
1114979,0,t1_chthfrw,I agree. The matchmaking is broken. I played the other night on a  vs  team extended warzone. I thought okay I can hold out it will balance only numbers mind you Im not even talking skill level but it never did it went to  vs  and  vs ... I quit. And quitting doesnt mean I can just join another game because if I try I will end up back in the same game on the same team. It is truly bizarre. The game itself is great I just wish there was something to be done about the balancing of matches. ,killzone,chv160c,1,t5_2ru72

1334996,0,t1_cijs2n6,Well Id like to know if the coop runs like the single player but people seem to be saying it does,killzone,cijsxiu,1,t5_2ru72
1353678,0,t1_cilvddv,Yes sir. i made a guide called CoOp made easy. Explains the whole points system right here I have another vid on the MarksmanMedic class and another one on Assaulttactician,killzone,cilz3mc,1,t5_2ru72
1428493,0,t3_2aerxq,Headshots and brutal melees do kill outright. How you could log almost  days into a game and not realize that is beyond me.Your timer nonsense would be awful. Its also m not  and requires line of sight. Shocked by a drone? Stun drones dont go after downed players but stun blast does destroy revive drones. Players being revived are easy kills no need to make them easier. Supply box is a useless ability unless you spam explosives and shackling support with it would make the class unfeasible unless you spam explosives. Support is not OP it balances having the best abilities by having the worst guns. Honestly it sounds like you simply are not very good at the game and a quick look at your stats confirms it. ,killzone,civc7j5,3,t5_2ru72
1564122,0,t1_civtz53,Actually Ive experienced this too and only in Killzone but not for an entire level. Ever since Intercept came out the initial menu screen when entering an online match will display garbled colors. I dont think this has anything to do with the PS and is likely a bug with KZ. ,killzone,cjcc364,1,t5_2ru72
2284883,0,t1_clu1js7,Yeah theyve responded to me once before on Reddit. Im just hoping they listen to this one. There are already tons of suggestions on feedback.killzone.com that say to bring in bot teammates for Intercept. I voted for the most popular one. It sucks not being with teammates but at least Id be able to play and have fun. ,killzone,clu4mpg,1,t5_2ru72

7898789,0,t3_4nhhbb,If they use the same clan system they had for KZ their game would come back.  It was ridiculously fun playing for betting for Valor and also the Coop mode could be improved.,killzone,d43wbue,3,t5_2ru72

10462710,0,t3_5i1lrs,In short It did. At least where im from. The lack of marketing and the direction shadowfall took didnt help out the brand name much. Also as other people have already mentioned when killzone  came out being labeled a halo killer really didnt help out its reputation much seeing as how it wasnt actually that great. killzone  was legitimately seen as a huge exclusive for playstation and unlike some other people i personally enjoyed  as well. its the changes which shadowfall took that made newcomers to the th gen see it as just another casual generic shooter. If killzone  had come out with a bang solid campaign kz style mp when the ps was launched killzone would have regained momentum as a franchise. GG hasnt disappeared seeing how horizon remains one of the most anticipated games of the year.,killzone,dcu1zb8,1,t5_2ru72
