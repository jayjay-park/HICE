Not because of any health concerns or what not but because of how GMOS are used to force farmers to invest in the crop. The patent laws for GMO based crops are absurd. For those who continue to run with the Bernie is anti science platform that was developed during the DNC primary to dissuade voters from him and towards hillary I would point towards this topic In that you will get positive rebuttals. Bernie isnt against GMOS. Hes just reluctant and wants them properly labeled  as do I. Hes not anti nucler. He just doesnt trust the US to properly dispose of waste. And hes not pro alternative medicine unless walking into a VA hospital and citing yoga and positive thinking as important to health is all it takes to be labeled as such. His stance against pharma isnt about science its about the people who are in need for medication and the price gouging that has occurred over medication. I agree its expensive but his recent position shows his desire to improve availability from other countries which are part of the scientific community as wellBernie is an advocate for science and without reputable sources to prove otherwise I will continue to make that case. ,MarchForScience,dcz2fmd,14,t5_3irg6

10671627,0,t1_ddggnxu,Im a systems biologist not a statistician.  So in my mind I see this from a systems approach.There are a lot of issues with the standardized tests and how they have been used.  Even the way they are implemented can be problematic.  Many are given on a computer this can be an issue when students have limited computer literacy and need to use classroom time to learn HOW to take the test.  So right there we get a small difference in students who have access to computers at home and those who do not.  Do tests measure the quality of a school? Tests are often tied to funding either through Title I programs or by school perception  failing schools get fewer top students reducing their scores further and reducing the socieconomic bracket of students attending the school as concerned parents pull their kids out of the school.  Poorer students means lower attendance for a huge variety of reasons and lower ability for the school to fundraise.  This lowers the budget for the school. So who cares if test performance is tied to funding?  Wont schools just improve performance?  Yes and no. Some schools especially magnets and charters spend inordinate amounts of time teaching to the test  teaching their students to be better test takers at the expense of other types of teaching and learning.  Even when these other types of teaching and learning are tied to longterm gains.  In short they sacrifice whole child education for shortterm gains in test scores. However maybe we are ok with these sacrifices if it results in a populace that at least is highly literate and understands at least th grade math.   So lets shelve the issues with what exactly the tests test and move on toHow well do these tests measure teacher performance? Well that depends on what you mean by teacher performance.  Lets put aside other metrics of performance like  ability of a teacher to inspire students ability of a teacher to act as an advisor to hisher students ability of a teacher to recognize skill and interest differences in students. Lets focus just on the teachers ability to increase student test scores by increasing reading comprehension math skills etc.  A K teacher has a class of  students for  hour to  hours a day  days a year barring student absences.  A student is in contact with or under the influence of their peers and family for the rest of their waking time.  It seems obvious that social and familial environment is just going to play a bigger role on average for a students development and test performance.  In fact its so obvious that people love to study it there are lots of exciting studies about this yet somehow we dont seem to be throwing a lot of money at this problem.Teachers with middle class students who all have highly educated parents are generally going to have higher test scores in their class.  And those test scores are going to increase at a higher rate. Put the same teacher in a class of students from low income struggling families and suddenly they are competing with things like  caring for siblings after school and during school part time jobs housing instability distracting home environments from lack of space hunger and poor nutrition etc. There are tons of studies and programs aimed at improving multiple metrics of student education including test scores attendance and attitude.  However we as a country have decided to not take the tough road in the case and aim for higher equality in education.  ,MarchForScience,ddgp4a4,6,t5_3irg6

Why is it that no matter what the weather is like the numbers add up to the hottest year on record after being adjusted for whatever factor the agencies decide to apply?Data will stand or fall on its own.  Let it.Now all that said.....I do believe that humans are screwing up the environment......over fishing over cutting polluting all that sort of stuff.  And again much of this goes back to an ever growing population.So in my opinion which I know you all want the real issue that is the heart of the problem is how many people there are.  That is the problem that needs fixed.,MarchForScience,dfkkmv0,-5,t5_3irg6
11368632,0,t1_dfk6hcu,I used to eat meat every day until I learned the impact on the environment it was having and the conditions these animals were living in. It took some time but eventually I got it down to eating meat three times a week then twice now Im eating meat once a week some weeks none at all. My end goal is to quit meat entirely as I have some problems with the ethics of factory farms and slaughterhouses but it really is an addiction and I can understand why people absolutely refuse to stop eating meat. But thats on them. It takes time and strong will to ease back on meat consumption but everyone can do it. Just at the very least try to see if you can eat less meat every week. Even if you dont give a shit about the livelihood of these animals or the impact on the environment your body will still thank you. Thats good enough reason.,MarchForScience,dfkm24o,5,t5_3irg6

11692114,0,t1_dglam7i,Of course it wont change anything in an immediate sense Trump and Republicans are in power and they happily ignore protests.  Because they despite all evidence to the contrary believe themselves to be autocrats immune to reality.But marches above all else raise public awareness of the importance of issues.  And the public is who decides who gets in power next time.But hey keep the flippant attitude.  Hold onto the antipopulist stance right up to    even.  And admonish your Republican representatives to do the same.  Thatll help their approval ratings.,MarchForScience,dglbi78,27,t5_3irg6

11709335,0,t3_6732pc,Whats the evidence for your imaginary cycle? Current scientific evidence overwhelmingly support that global warming is happening and is caused by human activity of releasing CO into the atmosphere. If you would like to propose an alternative hypothesis you will need to provide some evidence. Even if your imaginary cycle hypothesis stands the rising sea level is still gonna kill us all whether its cyclic or not. So if you dont think it is CO we still need to have lots of science funding going into research to figure out what that imaginary cause is for the changing climate so that we dont all die. ,MarchForScience,dgna6wt,2,t5_3irg6
11710331,0,t1_dgne31u,Science is inherently a questioning process by the very process of science everything is being tested and retested over and over. Leftists mostly understand this.

11710863,0,t1_dgnbprt,There is room to argue about this as much as there is about the nature of reality and epistemology itself but sound policy is made on sound science and the policy debates currently going on around climate change suggest that theres not broad scientific consensus based on an overwhelming preponderance of evidence. If the policy debates reflected reality it would be about  senators arguing for climate action against two saying we need to study further! ,MarchForScience,dgngfae,2,t5_3irg6
