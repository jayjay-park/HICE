476416,0,t3_1zk1n6,The  updates for the Optima were great. If you can get past the look of the steering wheel you get LED DRLs cool fog lamps the updated UVO system Updated gauges New tail lights and different stuff like that. Its an overall good refresh. The steering wheel is something that you can possibly get used to over time. The resale value on the  may also be higher than the  since the  is considered a newer model. Personally I think the flat bottom steering wheels looks amazing!,kia,cfuf67p,2,t5_2qwbt

948340,0,t1_chc23i6,Exactly! Even in  before I got the Optima SXL Kia was a brand I didnt even wanna look at the dealership because of the old Kia. Im glad I did because its exceeded expectations but ive been in older kias. New kia will never change what old kia was and that still hurts new kia.,kia,chc30xk,1,t5_2qwbt
1013299,0,t3_25k5p2,I have a great story just happenned this week . My  Sportage just had the timing belt done two weeks ago and soon afterwards my dash lights started coming on . Brake  Abs  tpms  esc off  and engine lites . Problem was it has  miles now . i posted about it on facebook on the kia site before i took it into the dealer for a repair . turns out the abs modulator is leaking onto the wire harness and causing havok . repair total will be about  !!! They dont stock the part and i didnt have the money so i took it home . Well i checked Facebook and kia suggested i call the  number for Kia cust assistance . I talked to a great guy and asked about financing the repair since i need it done and he said he will call the dealer for me . I told him the dealer is great and have allways been good to me . The district manager and the parts manager decided to take  off the repair for me . I am just stoked . I will borrow the rest but they didnt need to do that for me . wow . I am calling today to make the appointment . Thanks Kia . ,kia,chjgwek,3,t5_2qwbt

5153107,0,t3_3ljylm,Kia Shop Foreman here.... Actually Kia says  Mile oil changes synthetic oil or not.  The Forte bump shifter is a gimmick....the PCM still has control of all the shift solenoids.

11738363,0,t1_dgq5nus,That could also be the timing chain slapping against the cover. They typically shouldnt lose tension but if there is something wrong with one of the cam gears or the cam itself it could cause just as severe of an issue as a rod knock. My first car had the exact same sound but I got lucky and it never seized up on me. Depending on your mileage it may not be cost efficient to get it fixed but only a reputable shopdealer can tell you that for sure.,kia,dgqknh7,1,t5_2qwbt
