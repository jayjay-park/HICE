And you are right Google Camera does seem to have some focusing issues in low light.Anyway you might want to try out A Better Camera The UI is a little lacking but it does have pretty decent modes for postprocessing such as HDR and Dynamic Range Optimisation.,lenovok3note,csuqs2s,1,t5_38vg2

5605099,0,t3_3qrfnd,That was good laugh. Lol at the samsung guy. xDI just bought Lenovo K Note for my dad. He will be switching from Lumia . I cant even begin to imagine what it would be like for him to move to an open platform where he could do anything that a windows phone never let him do. ,lenovok3note,cwrv7o1,1,t5_38vg2
5709226,0,t1_cx3zv0a,Yeah this was it.  I thought I had checked it as it looked like it was there for leakage issues and there were cutouts for the contacts but I think all I determined is that I need a visit to the eye doc.  Thank you!,lenovok3note,cx4sa13,3,t5_38vg2
5869444,0,t1_cxozovq,VLC and Video Player both work perfectly but I cant select which app opens videos when browsing videos through Photos. Meaning any videos stored in the cloud only open in Photos and lag horribly. ,lenovok3note,cxp0jqq,1,t5_38vg2

7566815,0,t3_4iua4v,I have been using this device everyday for the past  months on the day I received it I flashed ROW S ROM and still using it. The device was never dropped. Have you had any issues with touch screen speakers etc.?Only issue I have from time to time is with Skype it is a bit random but I would get awful delays when writing. Virtual keyboard being unresponsive for a couple seconds. Any issues with performance or is still snappy after a year?I dont play at all on my mobile so I never noticed a resource heavy application or game struggling to run at some point. No performance issue noticed after  months using the same ROM either.One thing I noticed is the battery being drained real quick when Im not using WiFi. could be related to the ROM What ROM did you end up using?Still on the same rooted S ROM I want to flash Marshmallow but I will wait some time before doing so to eventually decide which ROM I should chose.,lenovok3note,d32b6ik,1,t5_38vg2
