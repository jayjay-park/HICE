On the skills that will have limits I think the maximum limit should be  your formula is very good train skills to  is very easy.your game is really cool do not turn it on pay to win.

Also the icons on the bottom right to switch classes sometimes loads buggy as well. I will capture a screenshot next time it happens.

Im only a lower level so I dont know about the higher level mob areas yet but for ksing get better and dont get KSed.  The higher level players should be able to run around and steal kills they spent more time playing and earning those levels.  What really needs to be done is make the maps larger and add more mobs that spawn with the increasing server sizes.  And honestly if you get scammed in this game you probably deserve it for being stupid.  Every game has trolls in it welcome to the internet.P.S.No one cares if you leave.... Youre one person and can easily be replaced.  Its a newish phone game. give it time to grow.

9260593,0,t3_572ox5,OK I have tested this system and I think the times need to be adjusted to about half of what it is. The problem is you can a timer on a monster rather quickly and many areas are relatively small Skeletons  and  so there is a good chance not only do you exhaust all your options but others are training on the ones you havent. Further I dont know which monsters I was training on  minutes ago and assume the timer resets if I get the repeated warning message. This requires too much coordination with fellow trainers in areas you are training in. Im not even sure if cutting the time in half would help to be honest but its a start.,RucoyOnline,d8pui8y,1,t5_3crv8

10145624,0,t3_5l9k2o,. Diamonds are for customizing only at this point. .yes. . Best in pvp is mage or melee. . You can pure but its going to mean you have limited options for killing mobs and others in pvp. . Level is independent from stats however you get a passive skill point for every  player levels.. Pvp starts in zones past assasins. . Endgame is pvp dragon killing and boss hunting. . There are currently  boxes pharaoh vampire lizard and santa. . No powerleveling but you can power train stats but surrounding yourself and spamming your skill. . training weapons allow  you to do less damage to mobs letting you get more skill ticks before moving to the next. Its the only way to keep you stats close to your level ,RucoyOnline,dbtz84s,1,t5_3crv8

11045052,0,t3_5xpu1f,Common wisdom says that your main stat and defense should be higher than your base level. The higher the better. Training takes a long time. Even more so when your stats get higher and higher. Power training your stats using your special attack on multiple monsters can make things go a little faster but your defense will not increase at the same rate. Keep in mind that  base levels is equivalent of  stat level so use that to determine whether you should train or grind. Good luck! ,RucoyOnline,dejxr7e,2,t5_3crv8

No need for a warning or a message telling you why.Afk is not a bannable offense IMO. It may be against the spirit of the game but most MMOs have some way to lazily train.Its not hard to play this game just time consuming. Requires very little attention even when farming. Start over LEGIT and you will catch up eventually. If you cant then you should have played by the rules.Sorry to be be so blunt but this happens in every game with grind involved.

He must see it in game with his own eyes. Most of the people who post about being falsely banned are lying. Almost all of them have been caught botting by other players and others besides the developer can say THAT guy is DEFINITELY botting.I cant  speak on his behalf but thats what hes told us.uRucoyOnline I think its time you respond...,RucoyOnline,dgsplgy,1,t5_3crv8
