997112,0,t3_25gewk,Thank you for this. I hate whenever I voice insecurities over my body it is always met with sneers and being told Im being disingenuous. Peoples relationships with their bodies are not influenced by others perceptions they are their own.Plus so many people feel its OK to comment on skinnier bodies because your socially desirable No. Noone likes having their bodies picked apart. Its not OK Its never OK.,2XLite,chhmnh9,3,t5_2tc6w

1202761,0,t3_27vjmp,I have no plans on ever having children and I probably dont have much useful to say on anything to do with parentdom but for serious breast feeding has to be one of the most natural things. I have no idea why anyone would think any thing else to be honest...Weird that people would want mothers to cover something so natural.,2XLite,ci4xg56,17,t5_2tc6w

I only recently discovered what type I am and it explains a lot.  It also makes it OK for me to be who I am and thats a comfort.,2XLite,ci7cood,1,t5_2tc6w

1502825,0,t3_2befrh,Arent you a feminist? Didnt that bother you?Soooo if a lady pays for a date for a man it must mean he has no rights and is totally unequal? Ha.I never understood how something as simple as splitting a bill or not is such a HUGE deal for so many people. When I met my husband we were too focused on each other to pay attention or keep score of who paid for what! ,2XLite,cj4nibr,4,t5_2tc6w

3030742,0,t3_2udk6f,Im bummed Im seeing this so late. I think a lot of us can relate to this kind of experience. Sadly after the anger and discomfort subsides I always just think Well I hope that never happens again. It makes me feel unnerved. Before my bf and I moved in together I lived alone and did things alone for a long time. I still go out by myself and have always felt confident. All it takes is one experience like this to suddenly make you doubt something as innocuous as grocery shopping. Its so shitty. You should get some mace stalk him and mace him. Kidding. notkiddingkiddingnotkidding,2XLite,coc4uev,2,t5_2tc6w
3704343,0,t1_cqef9oe,Looking at reviews is a really good way to weed out the losers! I always go to the practices website too a website is a great indicator of what kind of practice youre going to in my opinion.Think about the kind of person that youll feel comfortable talking to. For me it was a guy that reminded me of my dad because I love my dad and have your stereotypical daddyneglect issues. P Ive seen women my age before and it felt too much like I was talking to a workmate instead of someone whos trying to help me so I dont seek those types out anymore. Also when you do pick someone if you know beforehand what learning method works best for you and how you want the sessions to go communicate that! I work best with some homework postsession usually something like journaling on a specific topic or filling out a worksheet. Helps me keep my thoughts in order. I also work well with setting goals for each week so a structured counselor is the type of person that will most help me. ,2XLite,cqeiq8v,2,t5_2tc6w

4734339,0,t3_3fre2j,I know this is a terribly pessimistic viewpoint but every time I see things like this it just bugs me that guys have to do these wacky experiments just to empathize with something we talk about facing every day. Women can talk all day about a problem or an inconvenience but it takes literally trying it out for a lot of men to believe that its a problem? No wonder abortion is still up for debate assholes is congress cant empathize with the plight of a woman facing an unwanted pregnancy. No wonder the notallmen attitude is so prevalent they dont fucking believe us when we tell them about our experiences unless theyve either been through them personally as well or seen a flashy viral video about the topic. ,2XLite,ctrb0w6,30,t5_2tc6w
