6728525,0,t3_47pv37,Just take out all the instruments radios battery alternator vacuum pump and right seat flight controls.  Oh and might as well take out all of the interior and carpet too. Just bring a small stool for yourself and have everyone sit on the floor. Hell you really dont even need the engine cowling so just leave that behind also. This should boost your payload lbs. Youll be fine.Edit remove starter too and just have one of your passengers give you a hand job prop,Shittyaskflying,d0fadyn,4,t5_3a3pv
