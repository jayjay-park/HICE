The only reason I think this could be anything is cause it is found on whoismrrobot.com none of the other RWB pictures include this barcode and Kor Adana specifically said last week on the Aftershow that if you see barcodes to check them out.,MrRobotARG,d6yrqzu,3,t5_3focb

The binary strings are all different amp confused bit which makes me think it might just be a design but the first  do make an f albeit with what looks like a spare  and it looks like fs over the stars part of the stars and stripes ,MrRobotARG,d7yp2m8,3,t5_3focb

9044166,0,t1_d7yubg4,A few thoughts I havent delved into for  down  acrossRailfence cipher  fits neatly with  down  across     |||    r       e       .    | a     c .     .      i   n   .   .    |   l e     . .        f       .        Result for this example re.ac..in..le..f. Columnar transposition. Window  not a cipher although it could be combined with one  simply looking at an area window of characters with dimensions x in a larger textgrid. An overly complicated skip cipher put text into grid read  character then go  down and  right to read the next  when reaching end of columnsrows start from lefttop. Or something simple like simply being some text starting on the th line th character of some text.ETA Less seriouslikely D A Because people like things that almost look like chess notation d ETA Forgot The real confusing bit of that text is skip truncation. What does that even mean? Truncation means its already removed so how would I see it and skip it? Unless theres something that would normally be truncated but we shouldnt  i.e. skip the action of truncation.,MrRobotARG,d7yypq7,6,t5_3focb

9081297,0,t1_d7ys615,Now that the red wheelbarrow site has a clock embedded in the ASCII I was thinking  down  across could also be a time since the  is basically down and  is definitely across.  I could be very wrong too but maybe combining the times from the ascii clock to that could have value.  Most of this shit is over my head but it is fascinating as all hell.   ,MrRobotARG,d83fadh,1,t5_3focb
