4462174,0,t3_3c8a5y,Blair Athol  year  .abv Color deep scotch color Nose dusty barbershop bitter wood char.  sharp sherry.  sour fruit intenseness.   Taste hot sharp sherried malt. cherries red grapes syrupy. heat dryness pinch of salt. A bit off bitter overoaked. odd sulfur.  Finish a bit of a hot messits very flavorful yes but the sulfur and oak are very prominent.  the malt has a hard time showing through.  A little water helped tame it a bit but not for the much better. gt,WhiskeyReviews,cst4wxb,1,t5_2sv9w
