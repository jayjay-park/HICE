8978648,0,t1_d7r3c9e,Right I see how it could be done that way.Its a valid concern given the vote bots rTheDonald users have used in the past but they were also caught by the admins. If we need the admins for checking on ban evasions and report spamming we might as well need them for the oneoff vote bot detection too. ,AutoModerator,d7r3hti,1,t5_2tdjl

At rchangemyview we have a thing called Fresh Topic Friday where all posts must be manually checked before approval for freshness.
