And I havent tried connecting to a computer yet but the Bluetooth upload to garmin connect was a big selling point for me ,Garmin,d55q74w,1,t5_2t5id
8502396,0,t3_4w6bks,I have been researching fitness trackers for over  months and finally decided on the VivoSmart HR. I didnt even think about the length of the tracker and it seems to be absolutely huge on my small wrist. It seems to squeeze my wrist at the top and bottom and wriggles side to side because the huge edges leave big side gaps.Ive tried wearing it the other way round but it really hurts the underside of my wrist when I move it and Ive tried loosening it and making it tighter. Ive also tried it lower down on my wrist but it just ends up falling to the bottom and wriggling around. I am very upset not an understatement by this because I love the tracker and app itself they seem brilliant compared to my older Fitbit Zip however I dont think Ill be able to wear it for any longer than a few hours because of the awkward fit.Do any bony wristed people have any solutions? Im desperate to make this work!,Garmin,d64cpmj,2,t5_2t5id
8556129,0,t1_d6b192w,Its the Etrex  I went onto google maps to make my route and copied the url into gpsvisulaizer.com and transfer it over that way then made a route from the tracks and made adjustments so they were over the tracks and all looked well then I sent it to the internal storage and my route is all over the place!? the tracks are where they should be though. The maps says Osm generic routable on it followed by the country What do you think could be causing this? cheers matey,Garmin,d6b3aql,1,t5_2t5id

9986955,0,t3_5ieyrj,I just made this same switch!  Love it so far.  Battery beats my pebble and the fitness features are top notch. Not quite as smart or simple as my pebble but Im getting used to it.,Garmin,db9btrj,2,t5_2t5id
10061145,0,t1_dbiyve7,Thank you ubuckizard for the steps. It worked on my android phone.The part that is crazy is that the FR  has a cable and must be connected to the computer to sync etc. But the only way to remove the device is to use the mobile app. Not intuitive but it works.Currently have the FR  and loving it.,Garmin,dbizpcw,2,t5_2t5id
10195435,0,t3_5lyly7,I was waiting for this announcement but the pricing is ridiculous. I had a fenixHR but returned it due to awful optical heart rate performance and a bezel that scratched when you looked at it too hard. The weekly firmware updates that were one step up two steps back were getting annoying too. Garmin had better have gotten their act together before expecting anyone to pony up  for this watch  but I expect not. Ill probably just grab a Vivoactive HR for  at Amazon now that Ive seen this. Good enough for the gym and hiking. Good luck to those that buy this!,Garmin,dbzpism,4,t5_2t5id

10544586,0,t1_dd2u2z5,My own experience is very similar I started running in  with a FR and replaced it only because its so bulky compared to modern devices... Today I use a FR as my daily activity tracker and Im really happy with the built quality. Yes its a piece of plastic but the wristband is easy to change should it ever tear.Most likely Ill keep it until a future version of the Garmin Fenix comes out that is less bulky than the current Fenix  series to replace my everyday watch with it.,Garmin,dd3chc2,1,t5_2t5id
10715945,0,t1_ddfe7rt,Thats just the thing. I dont really CARE what my heart rate is. I check it to see. But when Im lifting my heart rate gets really high during heavy lifts. I wait till my watch says its down to about  before doing another set. But beyond that I dont really care what it is. Its more of a I wonder what it is kind of thing.,Garmin,ddl9qoc,1,t5_2t5id

10980112,0,t3_5wpder,Keep in mind while the FHR will give you coordinates and will record your track while out in the wilderness it will not display your location on map. For that either use a handheld GPS GPSr or something like an iPhone with Gaia GPS and offline maps.Plus good ole paper maps and compass.,Garmin,deck7qz,1,t5_2t5id
11158562,0,t1_dew7aao,If youre running with an HRM strap on the  then youre not using the wristbased oHRM for heart rate. The watch will grab data from the strap first if present. ,Garmin,dewt7hn,1,t5_2t5id
11367405,0,t1_dfkdwuv,As much as Id like to do that Id rather a different band that doesnt rash. I have an Apple Watch and no problems. Appreciate the input tho. ,Garmin,dfkh1wz,1,t5_2t5id
11374618,0,t3_627v9q,I got the silicone band from Amazon and I find it worse than the original one. The reason is that its completely smooth on the inside so there is more contact with the skin. I just got a replacement MoKo and it seems much better. You can PM me after the weekend and I can share my experience.,Garmin,dflakbq,1,t5_2t5id
11380543,0,t1_dflakbq,I will definitely pm you. Thanks in advanced,Garmin,dflyriq,1,t5_2t5id
