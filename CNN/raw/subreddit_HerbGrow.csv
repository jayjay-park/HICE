2551270,0,t1_cmrbde8,I know right? I almost feel guilty lol. Ive got a brand new soil patch to start up soon though so that will give me something to micromanage for at least a little while until it gets on cruise control too.Have you ever done a side by side grow using the growing methods you use now vs other grow methods?,HerbGrow,cmrl6sf,7,t5_33wyt

2608276,0,t1_cmy7nem,I did! It worked pretty well. Made about a quarter cup of butter took th of it one day got a nice longlasting but light buzz. Took  of it another day when I was sick and after a few hours I was just knocked the fuck out. Went right to bed at PM lol.Right now Im thinking Ill do  super lemon haze  querkle reg seeds so any could be males and get cut down and  master kush. Ive never worked with this size planter before though so who knows if that will be too many plants. If so no biggie I appreciate the variety more than the yield thats for sure.,HerbGrow,cmz1f2a,2,t5_33wyt

2633069,0,t1_cn26yth,That I did lol. But I was already pretty much there anyways. Id thought about worms in the past but didnt know it was relatively easy to keep them alive since I didnt know there were species that actually thrived in shallow soil. I was worried about them all dying but now I know thats isnt the case. Its a cheap investment that will  take my soil to the next level and save me money in the future so theres nothing else to really say. Ill probably be utilizing it in my herb and small vegetable garden this spring as well!,HerbGrow,cn29y00,2,t5_33wyt
2647657,0,t1_cn3ycbi,gt My grow space is xx just fyiYa it def looked bigger than my cabinet so I figured youd benefit from a bit more veg to increase final yields especially with plants that seem indica dominant so wont stretch much.gtlots of little shoots all over the sidesYa thats from not LSTing vigorously enough. If the main top never is pushed completely below the vertical level of the side branches the side branches will never become dominant. Also those plants just look genetically short and stocky with short side branches so theyd need extra vigorous LST and next time around you should probably top them. They look perfect for topping. Like this one. Hes going for something like LBHsway LST which is great for stocky plants that are hard with LST alone. Your plants look ideal for this method but its too late so just good info for the next run!gt How much did you end up with after your first grow?Lol I never put it on a scale. Once the drycure is done its all in various jars and Im too lazy to pull it all out put the jar on the scale tare then put it all back in!! But anyway my first grow was in a closet HSO Blue Dream LST a bunch w T w of CFL side lighting maybe? I think I got maybe  oz and it was maybe  feet tall. For my cabinet heres a plant starting flower heres that plant near harvest and heres the harvest. As you can see I could have easily vegged a bit longer and increased yield a bunch but needed some new bud for my stash asap!  So I appreciate the need for speed sometimes haha.gt Id love to get a x sunblazeAh I think thats what Ive been using! Well same deal but different brand Works well but Im def happy to be upgrading to a w HID tent in January  The crazy pics of really fat colas we see posted just dont seem possible under CLFsTs unfortunately  sadness,HerbGrow,cn46ia0,1,t5_33wyt

3214630,0,t1_cov5gm3,LMAO Im going to be in there rooting for the buds is that a pun? You should always ask questions bro. Anytime somebody denies you that right you can be sure something is up. But you need to do research before you pass judgment especially with something as complex as LED technology. What may work for one light may not work for all of them. We know LEDs are powerful and can produce good results although traditional LEDs have not been able to compete with the yields produced by HID. Well with new tech emerging that is changing but at a steep price. Here is an LED grow light comparison featuring CLWs Solar Storm  which should give you a better idea as to how BMLs fixture differs from yours.I hope I didnt come off as a dick lol I am pretty passionate about the growing community and growing technology. I am not a professional yet by any means but I try to educate myself as much as I can and in the process of designing and building a commercial operation I have done a lot of research and learned a lot about the newest technology. I was beating my head against the wall trying to decide what sort of light source to use for this new project and ultimately I feel the BML fixture is the best on the market but obviously at  it isnt an option for most people. ,HerbGrow,cov74wj,2,t5_33wyt

It will be a pleasure watching these fill out and frost up. I think youre handling the leaf browning well just with the kelp tea I couldnt really see much damaged foliage.

4285643,0,t1_cs8o1hd,I did about oz of HO per gallon of water give or take a little as I wasnt worried about doing any damage at those concentrations. On a heavy dose I probably did oz in a gal bucket. The plants seem fine and beyond that Ive read they even like it. I looked into HO and its somewhat good for the root systems since it ends up oxygenating them as the molecules break down into O and water. I came across a few instances of people who were worried about rootrot and used HO to fix the problem which is kind of wild!The  HO by itself is no joke though.

7726991,0,t1_d3k12n3,I wish I could remember the name of the text book he had with him. It was some academic text on botany. I wrote its name down and stuck it somewhere safe so now I cant find it.Real short version of it is that plants can only absorb so many lumens ? a day after that its all about vegflower timing. Once the plants reach that full battery state they switch modes and stop their normal growing. I did a time lapse of a plant in veg and every night it wilted a bit before the lights went out. I thought perhaps that is what I was seeing. For veg using .. is best. Id do it but I use my veg room as a man caveoffice and need more than  hours of light. Keeping the plants from going into the overcharged mode reduces stress and promotes growth as well as saves money. If you switch from a  to a  thats a savings of  on your biggest power user. Anyhow thats the short version of the few pages I read standing there and the half hour long lecture he was more than enthused to give me.
