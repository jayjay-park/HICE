11035080,0,t1_dechymd,I agree. I think a major reason for some of the types of obstacles choices they made was to give woman the best chance to compete on a more even playing field. This definitely helped the climbers as their assets are similar to the skill set a woman capable of competing would have. Parkour background I feel was the nd best asset to have and the best woman was a parkourer.,UltimateBeastmaster,deisv0c,1,t5_3etor
