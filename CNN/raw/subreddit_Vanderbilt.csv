241624,0,t3_1wuw0i,Congrats! Im a third year med student. I recommend Hillsboro village which is to the southeast of campus where the hospitals are. About  of the class lives here. My roommate and I pay about  together for a three story townhome on Capers Ave you can expect prices about person for a two person apartment within a min walk to campus about  for a min walk and maybe  for a min walk. I highly recommend living with a roommate. Youll get to know someone else very well and if you dont know anyone else coming to the school someone to pal with for the first few weeks. Also utilities are about  the cost per person as it would be alone. If you have any other questions then feel free to contact me. Would be happy to give you my email or phone number. Also if you need a place to stay while looking at a few places to live I can host you.Best of luck!,Vanderbilt,cf5so6l,2,t5_2s4s4

3800321,0,t1_cqpd9x4,I like this route.  I went regular decision when I applied back in .  At that time though there was a common application they really liked it if you used their own application.  I dunno if that is still the norm but I would couple your advice with that to use their own application if such an application still exists.,Vanderbilt,cqpgt0i,1,t5_2s4s4
