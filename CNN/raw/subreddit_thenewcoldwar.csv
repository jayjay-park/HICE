9979296,0,t3_5igd9v,First PointCan we have some sort of clarification maybe a stickyannouncement over the goals of this subreddit so people dont think were the conspiracy version of the election? I did not choose the name but calling this a cold war is kind of unfortunate.A disclaimer or warning against Red Scare paranoia and McCarthyism is needed so people dont think were trying to instigate something against Russia or have something against them the country and the people. If this was China France or some other country we would discuss them too.Should be made clear that this isnt about communism since Russian Federation isnt communist nor are we necessarily calling for witch hunts against politicians and individuals. Needless to say I dont think anyone here wants to encourage vigilantes to do something like what happened with pizzagate where someone took it upon themselves to investigate in person.Second Point Submission flairs for easier organization of material? Then submissions can be filtered like they are on renoughtrumpspam for better researchsearching purposes. Some broad categories that make sense right nowGeopolitics  international relations great power politics USEU  Russia politics etc.Party Committee Hacks  includes DNC Podesta emails RNC andor Republican operative email hacks etc. Online PropagandaDisinformation Operation  hybrid warfare dezinformatsiya fake news etc. Perhaps the flair should be Dezinformatsiya?Trump Team Russian Connections  members and associates of Trump team with connections and ties to Russian regime. Election Hacking  the hackingrigging of the election itself the voting machines voting fraud etc.Cyberwarfare  of or relating to the ongoing covert cyberwar between nation states.Skeptical  the other side arguments against etc.Europe  for material related to the European theatre e.g. Brexit Germany France Austria etc.,thenewcoldwar,db8bwvz,5,t5_3i0a4

9996515,0,t1_dbak0yt,I did! Thanks for sharing. Im still not very optimistic about the EC stopping Trumps inauguration but we gotta do what we can right? ,thenewcoldwar,dbakoyh,2,t5_3i0a4

10660093,0,t3_5sj4ex,But his UN ambassador disagrees?Either Trumps pulling a massive trick on the country or his administration has some major internal issues.,thenewcoldwar,ddfia01,4,t5_3i0a4
10789226,0,t1_ddstwpm,It may come off as threat. But it is deeply important that they do this for their own national security.,thenewcoldwar,ddstz0r,2,t5_3i0a4
10815709,0,t1_ddvk2ku,Exactly just present the facts and take it from there.  I think one of trumps biggest mistakes so far was pissing off the Intelligence community by calling them nazis before even having a chance to meet with them. Im sure at this point there are more than a few people over there who are looking to bury him.,thenewcoldwar,ddvkbi8,1,t5_3i0a4
11041512,0,t3_5xnsm6,Clapper claims there was no FISA warrant against Trumps campaign. Manafort Page and Stone were no longer official members of the campaign at the time the FISA warrant is said to have been issued.,thenewcoldwar,dejjax3,1,t5_3i0a4
11080229,0,t1_denu8uy,You think some one losing a paycheck is harm? Polluting the planet is harm. This is actual damage to the environment vs people having to find new jobs for an obsolete industry. ,thenewcoldwar,denxmug,2,t5_3i0a4
11270183,0,t1_df98a8b,Yeah because corporations cater to the general publics  best interests like like Russia theyre so different. ,thenewcoldwar,df9gir4,1,t5_3i0a4
11767034,0,t1_dgtszm2,gtSo youre upset that secrets were leaked? Hey man Im all for information dont care if russia hacks it china hacks it I want as much information to formulate an opinion.Youre formulating your opinion on half of the possible information since only one side was hacked. Is it really that hard to see how youre being manipulated? gtAlso I still dont see a problem? The American people would have voted in Hillary based on whatever reasoning they had in a system created by your forefathers. and yes Hillary should be in jail.. so should the heiress of walmart and all her DUIs so should that  year old kid who got drunk and killed  kids in his suv and was let off because of money. This is a random mixture of whataboutism and choosing to be OK with the situation because your preferred candidate won. Again  partisan bullshit.gtBut youre ignoring the current situation youre too focused on some little shit like Trump and his ties. Think deeper friend. think of the system our species lives in. Think of how you live your life.Because this sub focuses on the current conflict between Russia and the US. Trump and his lies are a major component of that conflict. Go to Philosophy if you want to talk about lifes meaning. ,thenewcoldwar,dgttnwq,4,t5_3i0a4
