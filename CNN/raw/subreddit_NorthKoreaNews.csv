104598,0,t1_ceqbe13,Well often I get flack if I ninja edit previous posts and I kept thinking of new angles to this issue which are important..Thats okay if you dont understand. People without a technical background rarely if ever understand this kind of thing. However that doesnt prevent them especially younger people from using them. What I am saying can be condensed down to the concept that regardless of what the DPRK wants BIG changes are coming FAST which will make their ban on radios and TVs that can receive outside signals completely impossible to enforce.An understanding an intuitive understanding of whats called Moores Law is crucial to understanding the allure of SDR to equipment manufacturers..The implications of computers meaning microprocessors being so small and so cheap say  cents each in quantity and so power efficient is that all radios will soon contain small embedded computers because its cheaper that way and use SDR because its cheaper that way and the radios that are built require very little if any in the way of calibration or adjustment compared to TVs and radios previously In the past three or four years most TV sets have shifted to using SDR and what that means is that the cases now are increasingly empty space. The PCB is very small relative to their size in the past. And the functions are all in the firmware.  This is why the DPRK is having problems sourcing radios and TVs externally.Did that make any sense to you at all? here is a link on Moores Law.The graph on the right is misleading though because the growth in computing power for a given dollar value is exponential not linear.See the small legend under the graph which says the following. Plot of CPU transistor counts against dates of introduction. Note the logarithmic vertical scale the line corresponds to exponential growth with transistor count doubling every two yearsOkay did you follow that? Does it make sense now?,NorthKoreaNews,ceqc8wh,-4,t5_2wlaq

Germany is still paying to build up the East but compared to North Korea East Germany looks like an economic powerhouse. North Korea produces no goods that are of value outside of North Korea. And any skills the workers arent as useful. For example North Korea makes TVs and Radios that can only tune to  station. There is zero desire for that outside of NK and nor is there demand for labor that has skills to create these or the backwards methods used to build them. On the other hand the transnational corporations will suddenly have a new source of very cheap labor on the doorstep of  large wealthy economies to take advantage of.Edit Maybe I should clear up my point. What NK has is skilled labor for themselves. However should it collapse that skilled labor becomes unskilled in terms of the South Korean and global economy.

4805180,0,t3_3gpep3,After reading this story I would like to request Redditors help in asking the Thai authorities to show lenience for this man Isaac Byungdo Lee. I do not know Lee nor have I had any previous contact with him. I am not even Korean. I am just a person who has a tremendous respect for Thailand but also a strong desire to help the North Korean people especially the refugees who have often suffered indescribably in their attempts to reach South Korea.A fiveyear prison term strikes me as both harsh and profoundly unjust particularly in view of the fact that Lees activities were in no way harmful to Thais. Rather Lee assuming the charges against him are true was simply one small element in the large informal network of ethnic Koreans and others existing in many Asian countries which tries to help escaped North Koreans to reach the safety of the ROK where they are automatically eligible for full citizenship resettlement education benefits etc. This network is really very much like the Underground Railroad which helped escaped American slaves to reach the Northern states and freedom.Therefore what the Thai authorities have done is analogous to arresting Harriet Tubman and putting her in prison. I strongly urge them to reconsider. Thailand is a mostly Buddhist nation and Buddhism is well known and respected all over the world due to its reverence for human life. In North Korea individual human beings are regarded as having value only to the extent that they serve the interests of the Kim JongEun regime. In North Korea entire families are put into prison if one member is alleged to have criticized the North Korean government. They often live out their lives in unspeakable conditions in prison camps from which escape is almost impossible. Because of the regimes obsession with racial purity North Korean women who are caught in China pregnant by Chinese men often undergo forced abortion or even have their infant children murdered in front of them. Refugees trying to escape across the Tumen River are routinely shot. The regimes dogmatic economic policies have led to the entire nation becoming an island of famine and suffering in the midst of one of the most economically vibrant regions of the entire globe.Thailand is a proud independent nation with a beautiful culture which welcomes visitors and expatriates with open arms. It scores highly on international indices for personal freedom social equality and cultural openness. I therefore believe that it is most inappropriate regrettable and indeed shameful for the government of Thailand to act as an enforcer for the brutal and internationally scorned Kim JongEun regime. I urge the Thai government to treat Lee Byungdo with the most lenience and compassion that is allowed under the laws of Thailand. Moreover if the specific statutes that Mr Lee is alleged to have violated leave no room for such lenience I urge the national government in Bangkok to revise said statutes so that any North Korean refugees who do manage to reach Thailand are processed according to international humanitarian law specifically the guidelines set forth by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees UNHCR and the International Committee of the Red Cross ICRC.I note also that no one including Mr Lee has asked the Thai government to accept any financial responsibility for the North Korean refugees. On the contrary South Korean human rights organizations and the South Korean government itself already offer whatever financial resources are needed to assist North Korean refugees temporarily located in third countries and ultimately transport them to South Korea where resettlement assistance is provided according to existing ROK law.For any redditors who would like to help Mr Lee I ask that you send a respectfully worded email or make a phone call to the Thai embassy or consulate in your country and express your concerns for Mr Lees welfare and hopes that he can be as leniently treated as Thai laws allow. A comprehensive list of Thai embassies and consulates abroad can be found hereIf you support international human rights want to help North Korean refugees and are a friend of Thailand please make this your one pay it forward for the day.

Korea can easily be the trigger to another global conflict. N. Koreans are suffering beyond our imagination... we get that we really do but I dont think the full consequences of war in Korea are understood by the avg. audience. Ive worked with refugees before from N. Korea Algeria etc... Id like to think I have a better idea than the avg. redditor about the human ramifications of war. Its not just about Korea this is going to have a huge impact on global affairs for decades to come. With all due respect to Ukraine Iran etc.. were talking about a potential fullscale war on one of the worlds largest economies and cities that happens to be in the middle of Japan US China and Russia. Think of thousands of artillery missiles poison gases etc.. on NYC to get an idea why nobodys keen on war or even a military conflict of any size at all.

11389372,0,t3_62j2wy, We got the standby order on Monday and took off on a Bombardier Global Express business jet around .am on Thursday from Subang air base. We were not sure what to expect as we entered North Korean air space he said when met at the Bunga Raya Complex of the Kuala Lumpur International Airport KLIA on Friday. The airman who has  years of experience under his belt flew with a Royal Malaysian Air Force crew of two pilots two copilots and two quartermasters. LtCol Hasrizan said the crew had pretended to be civilian pilots to stay on the safe side. The only issue was that there was a long delay between the time we landed in Pyongyang at .pm Malaysian time and the time we were allowed to take off at around .pm he said adding that he didnt know the reason for the delay. The flight then stopped at Fuzhou Changle airport in China to refuel before returning to Malaysia. The nine were the remaining Malaysian diplomatic corps in North Korea and their families comprising Malaysias counsellor to North Korea Mohd Nor Azrin Md Zain his wife and their three children personal assistant to the ambassador Noor Saaidah Jamaludin and her husband and eightmonthold baby as well as administrative assistant Nirmala Malar Kodi Singaram.,NorthKoreaNews,dfmyt3k,2,t5_2wlaq

11735669,0,t1_dgq8cuv,Yeah I wouldnt sweat it. theyve had  years to plan for this and if shit does go down unexpectedly know that  NKs artillery is in poor condition the operators dont get to practice much and Ive read several times that analysts expect NK is overstating its capabilities. and that only  of what they do have is probably functional and ready. That will still cause a lot of damage but know that what the media parrots is NKs boasts and theyve been parroting that so long we kind of all accept it as truth now. Theyll still cause damage and they could also decide to use chemical weapons which I why theyd probably evacuate the NW quadrant of the city or failing that option have a party line of ordinance carrying planes ready to roll to take that stuff out ASAP.In any case the chances of something happening as always are slim. No one wants anything to happen everyone wants a diplomatic solution. If something does happen  an itchy trigger fingered infantryman say  in the middle of this posturing for a better negotiating position know that for  years East AsianKorean MastersDoctorate students have been researching and writing papers about the best thing to do in any scenario before they graduate  and then Im sure many of them go work for state departments and make policy. Were probably on plan .C by now. This isnt the Middle East were new unknown factors come out of the woodwork constantly  the actors here are all well known and relatively predictable. Bottom line dont worry but do be aware and having a meet up place with loved ones is a good idea because in the event of an emergency cells phones will be overloaded. I grew up in a city of  and flooding in one part of the county was enough to overload the cell service for the next hour. I would put money on Cell phones being worthless in any emergency situation in Seoul or in any large city. So have a meet up place or plan ahead of time. ,NorthKoreaNews,dgq9new,2,t5_2wlaq
