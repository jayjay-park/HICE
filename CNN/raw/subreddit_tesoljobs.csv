482876,0,t1_cftin1v,K! The experience was amazing quite fulfilling. The CELTA course is of course quite intense. The cool thing about the one in Montaita is that lodging and food are included. The lodging is in these beautiful cabaas about  meters from the center of town. The included food is quite delicious and the cooks are awesome guys. So MonFri was like this am breakfast aa input classes on teaching classes taught by a couple of extremely qualified British folk ap guided lesson planning choosing your lesson with your instructor last minute questions etc p lunch then class  then everybody critiques each others teaching you observe even when you dont teach then dinner. Between lunch and dinner you are definitely working every day then after dinner youre working until youre too tired. And a  word essay due every Monday. So yeah intense but extremely high quality and with some really progressive methods. I flew in to Guayaquil Jan nd stayed a few nights there then the class started on Jan .  I am now in Riobamba a nice city of about  up in the mountains about  hours from Quito. Montaita itself is totally insane. Its like the South American Ibiza. Lots of people from all over the world partying their asses off on the beach all night long. Good street food cheap hostels cheap cocktails. Of course I didnt have much time to enjoy all that but I definitely plan on returning before the wet season starts so that I can enjoy it properly. Pros less expensive than a course in the states with food and lodging included. Beautiful location. After you finish the course youre already in Ecuador if thats where you want to work. Extremely personal attention from instructors  teachertrainers for  teachers during my session but I think usually . I could go on and on.  Cons Everyone is extremely close. The  of you are in each others faces . If you dont like someone then you better just deal with it. Wasnt a problem for me but I think some people got a little bit of cabaa fever. This is also a pro however I made some great friends. Honestly there arent any other big cons. Its a great program just be prepared to work your ass off.Congrats on the dual citizenship possibility! The only real problem with Ecuador Ive had is that the work visa process is pretty ridiculous so its good that you might not have to deal with that.Good luck!,tesoljobs,cfv5mya,2,t5_2unem

2767375,0,t1_cni6kw0,Is it still low even though theyre paying for vehiclegas and the apartment? I dont have a ton of experience here but that seems like it could make up the difference fairly readily. ,tesoljobs,cnin1w2,1,t5_2unem

11621912,0,t1_dg9v2vp,I found a few options that run a couple hundred. The courses Im deciding between both are at U of Georgia. The k is like a masters program. But the certification course is four sixweek modules totaling . Based on response and the fact that I have no interest in teaching in USbased public schools I have decided to tak the less expensive route.    I will not be pursuing teaching in China at this time although I do plan to try out some Skypeutilized options and may teach Chinese children from the US as soon as I certify. Ultimately I want to use my bachelors in business and the TESOL cert to spend  months in Spain Italy then France teaching English to professionals. Basically spending  months out of the year in a foreign country then return to the US to teach English in a nonprofit environment each year for six months. After the three years are completed I plan to make more logistical less personal bucketlist choices in terms of location but still do want to take on six month contracts in places like maybe China Japan Kazakhstan etc.    ,tesoljobs,dgdcs15,1,t5_2unem
