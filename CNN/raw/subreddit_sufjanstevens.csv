695995,0,t3_21mrsq,I just think its hilarious. The guys having fun! Hes no promoting casual sex and clubbing just accepting that thats a huge part of modern life and maybe trying to understand the appeal. Like Akaforty said below hes still everything hes done before which makes this all the better its so seemingly out of character. To me it just seems like the natural direction for his music to go. Maybe hes tired of working so hard tackling big emotional universal issues. Hes letting loose. And Im enjoying it so much. Love this song. Maybe not the video but its beautiful in its own right.and that Pitchfork reviewer just doesnt understand.,sufjanstevens,cgjdxjv,2,t5_2s75c

3095362,0,t3_2vltpm,This list is pretty thorough and it really turned me onto Sufjans Christmas albums. My personal favorite would have to be Justice delivers its death or Sister winter. ,sufjanstevens,coiu01u,3,t5_2s75c
3324196,0,t1_cp738o6,Age of Adz is probably my overall favorite Sufjan album... until this. I absolutely love every single song on this album. I knew it was going to be good after I read the pitchfork interview. Its so close to him and knowing he was going for a more stripped down approach I knew it was going to be really raw and after hearing it I think its nothing less than a perfect album. Its hard to say which is my favorite now because theyre just completely different styles of Sufjan but its just an incredibly poetic album and I hope all the Sufjan fans that lean more toward the Age of Adz style Sufjan give this album the chance it deserves. Its incredible poetic and sad and it will floor you.,sufjanstevens,cp76pk3,3,t5_2s75c

3486114,0,t1_cppav96,I can second this. I go to school in Eugene and climbed Spencers Butte within the last couples months and it was much different. That looks almost like a West Virginia landscape or something. Definitely not Oregon.,sufjanstevens,cppn4gk,2,t5_2s75c

3561050,0,t1_cpwvpzn,The shadow of me... Im dead line could be talking about the relinquishing of identity in order to allow the Spirit of Gd to become his identity. This idea is mentioned in the NT a few times the Greek word being kenosis. These are common Christian themes.,sufjanstevens,cpy6okt,2,t5_2s75c

3688523,0,t3_32mv9h,Super Sexy Woman is one of my favorite Sufjan tracks. On the whole A Sun Came is definitely a noble first album however it does shine a bit dimmer when compared to the rest of his catalog. Its a bit like how Neil Youngs first record didnt really take him anywhere but its still a Neil Young record so its probably better than most. In any case I would love to see A Sun Came reissued on vinyl they did EYR so I dont see it as a huge stretch. ,sufjanstevens,cqcpsm5,5,t5_2s75c

Id be interested to talk with you. Check out my website The Internet School of Magic particularly my bio which briefly tells my story thats similar to yours.,sufjanstevens,cw2jrdq,1,t5_2s75c

7319759,0,t1_cxwe71h,Liked your comment for the Age of Adz line. I think Seven Swans is my favourite followed by Carrie amp Lowell and Michigan probably equal second. I know that Illinois is his most popular album. I just dont feel it...,sufjanstevens,d2a7fp7,2,t5_2s75c
