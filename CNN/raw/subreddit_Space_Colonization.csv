6518310,0,t1_cztgbbe,The first thing was referencing your statement gt We have decades of research on longterm effects of microgravityAnd we cant was meant as we are not able to do so in the required amount. Of course we could build a star trek like space station with artificial gravity of the moon or even mars but its easier and cheaper to test it directly on the moon.Problems of rotating ringshaped space stations get it to spin without wobbeling out of control be able to dock and access the station that thing must be fcking huge to produce sufficient amounts of gravity also get someting that big into an orbit that does not need to be adjusted every now and then like leo because adjusting something that massive AND SPINNING stopping the spinning would require quite a lot of energy and you would have to send it spinning again is bonkers,Space_Colonization,cztjlhq,1,t5_2u9ez

9119982,0,t1_d87y4ic,Youre making a heck of a lot of sweeping assumptions about human health and practicality that we dont have data for.By Ram Rockets you mean a hybrid launch system like Skylon?If they work then yeah that would be a more efficient launch system but it gets you nothing once youre out of Earths atmosphere.Gravity can be useful for slowing down once you reach your target if you design your trajectory right and Mars atmosphere is helpful there too.Thats one reason why my Moon thinking is perhaps less practical than I thought DeltaV to the surface of the Moon is similar to that to the surface of Mars but the Moon cannot offer the refuelling capability Mars can.Calling Elon Musk a crackpot is laughable at this stage. Ten years ago sure! But now? The man is resupplying the ISS and landing the boosters he launched the resupplies on.,Space_Colonization,d882nll,2,t5_2u9ez
9670468,0,t1_da4e68r,Yeah there are a couple of go to videos I have saved that really hit the spot. This comes close to being my favorite though.,Space_Colonization,da536fa,2,t5_2u9ez
11743198,0,t3_67esgr,An absolute delight.. However two or three of the questions at the end were atrocious. Im surprised Elon had the patience to craft out an informed answer for those nitwits.,Space_Colonization,dgr4dmp,1,t5_2u9ez
