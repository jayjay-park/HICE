98198,0,t3_1v80z9,Is your passphrase actually blank in the real file or did you just blank it out for security reasons? I copied the above lines and with a blank passphrase I got this        gpg batch genkey test     gpg Generating a basic OpenPGP key    gpg test missing argumentI deleted the passphrase and it worked    gpg batch genkey test     gpg Generating a basic OpenPGP key,GnuPG,ceplyfo,2,t5_2rtst

5879973,0,t1_cxqcxu0,I suppose a lot of the best practice advice is as you have mentioned for those who are high value targets e.g. Journalists. Im just looking to keep personal but innocuous data personal. My threat model isnt very threatening pBesides its law in my jurisdiction to divulge keys on request so Im pretty much screwed WRT real secrecy anyway. That is unless I emigrate.,GnuPG,cxqeaqu,4,t5_2rtst

7334341,0,t3_4fpg6l,I dont know... The whole point of using GPG at least for some people is to encrypt files messages etc. I have seen some people saying that if you do not have your key secure then the whole encryption is not secure. Im paranoid sometimes and thats why I keep my secret key local. I know that the whole point of the backup is to have everything you need in some other source than an external drive and maybe cloud is the way to do that. I use mega too because is really simple most secure than others etc. but that doesnt mean Ill trust them with all my heart. I encrypt every backup I made before uploading to mega with deja dup backup default for Ubuntu. My GPG secret keys I just store them locally on my external hard drive and encrypted with encfs. In other  situation I would use encfs in mega for uploading my secrets keys but my trust is not enough for that.,GnuPG,d2bv49j,2,t5_2rtst
