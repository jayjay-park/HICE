Almost certainly many of them were driving to orange line stops which were the closest and now silver line stops will be closer.

The silver line could be reconfigured to run exclusively between IAD and EFC over a long weekend  would involve a bunch of new station signage and I imagine someone entering a few dozen commands into a computer terminal somewhere.  I would imagine WMATA if theyre smart about it will be watching what happens to ridership at ViennaDunn LoringWFC as well as silver line and adjust how many trains on each line beyond the splitetc.  I think its safe to say when Silver line opens the western three Orange line stations will see a ridership decline or rather a ridership shift to Silver line.

Im a much bigger fan of Metro than the average redditor but it took me  minutes to get to work on a normal day without having to transfer lines.  To me the value of my leisure time is quite high  Im much more happy being able to spend that time doing as I please and being able to run errands without sacrificing my entire afternoon and evening.There are plenty of reasons to live in DC or closein to DC other than frequently patronizing bars and other nightlife.  I do happen to go out quite often but I would still opt to live in DC if that were not the case.  If you enjoy having the option of being around people while in public the burbs are no comparison to DC.  Youll actually be able to live easily without a car if that appeals to you at all and exercise take in cultural eventsattractions neighborhood festivals museums etc. and socialize without beating yourself into the ground.That being said if you truly never leave the house and place a premium on a lot of space andor paying a low rent you may want to give Maryland a try.

326361,0,t1_cfel3k8,Oh my you might set an alltime record for comments if you post that question to this sub.Short answer is just a general lack of accountability over budget and late with every single thing they ever do with no exceptions ever.I guess major things would obviously include the multiple fatalities from a red line accident about  or so years back. Many instances of unexpected and seemingly inexplicable single tracking and just outright no tracking during rush hours leading to huge amounts of crowding on the platforms. The metro is basically unusable on the weekend due to maintenance issues that are not likely to ever go away due to the whole over budget and late thing.If you want to get on the hate wagon this site keeps good track of the mess www.unsuckdcmetro.blogspot.comI feel like it is a bit over the top and biased so maybe take it with a grain of salt.Im not trying to downplay your plight this morning but expecting them to be running busses at am after they announced a suspension of service beginning at am...that is very optimistic.

842349,0,t1_ch00szn,What do I think she should have done?  Idk a goddamn thing to actually make the system run decently.  Better service explaining service adjustments better running the system in a decent way.  For example when headways are  minutes on the weekend why the hell dont they have offset tracks that share lines.  The way it seems to work now is there is a yellow train the one minute behind that there is a green train.  Why not offset them  minutes to better service the core?Another thing during all this track work.  At least give us decent schedules.  I can take  minute headways if I can use the real time arrivals to figure it out.  Okay there is one train  minutes away one  minutes away and one  minutes away.  I can plan around the shitty service.  But that isnt how WMATA does it.  Theyll do one train  minutes away then a No Passenger at an undefined amount of time away.  Cant plan for that I have no choice but to sit and wait.  The weekend repair work fucks using the transit system up but WMATA does absolutely nothing to mitigate the problem.How about the way that WMATA throws money away? Certainly that falls on the heels of the board.How about terrible rush hour red line service certainly she could mention that.

Sure.I like Fairfaxs decision as long as they have followthrough to increase the influence and effectiveness each Metro stop has without reliable connector buses it doesnt help it just sends cars elsewhere.

Even taking a big salary hit Id be more than coming out ahead in somewhere like Richmond.

1300552,0,t1_cifhvzi,I did the math using the WMATA trip planner and its pretty much never worth it to do YLgtLEnfantgtwest. Maybe if youre going a stop or two west of LEnfant. The relevant data points PentagongtLEnfant  minutes YL PentagongtFoggy Bottom  minutes BL PentagongtMetro Center  minutes BL LEnfantgtMetro Center  minutes LEnfantgtFoggy Bottom  minutes LEnfantgtRosslyn  minutes which note is the exact same time as the advertised BL headwaysSo lets say you want to go to Foggy Bottom. By doing the LEnfant switch youre now at  minutes on the train which is already more than the  minutes to directly from Pentagon to Foggy Bottom via the BL. Now consider its rush hour so with how crowded LEnfant is it could take a couple of minutes to go downstairs. And then it could still be  minutes before a train shows up.So now youve hit about  minutes overall which is pretty much exactly the same time as if youd just waited for the BL even if you had to wait out the full  minute headway. And for what? The hassle of transferring at LEnfant? It only gets worse if youre trying to go somewhere on the OL or SL in VA as if youre in a position where you actually care what color train shows up at LEnfant it could sometimes be more like  minutes until a train shows up.Long story short it doesnt make sense to do the LEnfant switch if youre trying to go west of LEnfant and if it does makes sense for you to take the YL to LEnfant and switch to the OLBL there then you were probably already doing so before Rush because its always made sense to get involved with that switch if youre trying to go east of LEnfant.,washingtondc,cifxg4u,5,t5_2qi2g

You can get reliable holsters that work while youre jogging too its not very difficult. I am curious as well. My educated guess is its higher simply because as long as youre not a felon can pass a background check and pass a safety course they give you a license. A lot of states make it difficult to get a license so the number is much lower just due to that.

1562352,0,t3_2c50ki,Hi! Metro fare systems engineer here. There is a chip in the card. Your serial number stored value passes and recent travel history are on stored locally on the card. Transactions performed at the gates and vendors are stored on the machines and synchronized with the backend at regular minute intervals. When you see the SEE STATION MANAGER message its not because the card wasnt recognized its that your travel history has an issue. Its usually for one of two reasonsa Entry without a prior exit or vice versab Spent longer than  hours in systemThese measures are in place to prevent fare evasion. The  hour limit is to prevent for instance using  separate cards for entryexit at homework one for each station so you only pay minimum fare each way . as opposed to the full fare. The card does not reset after  hours as ujamisonia said. You will need to see the station manager no matter what. In this case theyd have to set the gate to override in which case it will accept any card and let it through.,washingtondc,cjc43mj,8,t5_2qi2g

1572037,0,t3_2c9nzt,Here is my completely subjective personal take based on my family living in the nearby area since before they built the Tysons Corner Center mall.  I think the poor pedestrianbike infrastructure is a result of  historical circumstance combined with weak local government.  The area was almost rural  years ago and then it became a suburban commercial and retail hub in a process driven more by developers and builders than local government.  Fairfax county has a weak central government and most towns within the county are not incorporated as official municipalities they are simply place names to make it easier to know where you are in the unincorporated suburban sprawl.  As Tysons grew as shopping and office district transportation decisions were driven by the concerns of the commercial interests that were the main stakeholders in the area. If Tysons was an actual city with a city manager or a mayor then there would be a clear focal point of authority to take the lead on sensible planning.  Compared to Arlington and Montgomery Counties Fairfax has always had a more laissez faire developer friendly attitude towards city planning.  For a major contrast look just  miles down route  to the City of Falls Church.  In Falls Church there are miles and miles of bike paths two Metro stations and much better pedestrian infrastructure.  Not coincidentally they also have a city government and a mayor.  ,washingtondc,cjdbu6f,4,t5_2qi2g

2080653,0,t3_2ip8xi,Ron Linton is so out of touch its almost laughable. All of his recent proposals are desperate attempts to prolong the inevitable death of the irrelevant Taxi Commission. All of his ideas are so terrible I dont even know where to begin. Do they really think companies like Hailo and Taxi Magic are just going to shrug and walk away from the DC market?Heres a better idea begin by scrapping the useless DCTC. Hire a group of young innovative engineers to create a backend system that tracks available cabs. This system would be maintained and operated by the District. Provide a smart phone or other device for cab drivers to connect to this system. Then provide an API for third party appservice companies to electronically hail a cab. Cab drivers can choose to affiliate themselves with one or more of these companies. The companies would screen the drivers and their vehicles to ensure customers are receiving a quality experience. If a driver gets consistently bad reviews or their vehicle falls in to disrepair that company will drop that driver.So I would launch the TaxiXYZ app on my phone and the the app would send a request to the Districts system to notify the nearest car affiliated with TaxiXYZ. Boom done.The fare would continue to be regulated by the District but the private company gets a small cut. This pays for the screening and other costs while providing an incentive to make sure they only affiliate with the best drivers.,washingtondc,cl4aotv,16,t5_2qi2g

But I think that just boils down to preference over what the role of government is.Ultimately I think that the crux is what youre noting in the second point and others are mentioning  we allow a lot of other substances that seem much worse. Benefit is hard to measure for legalizing drugs abstracting from the stupid drug laws which are idiotic even if we keep marijuana illegal  the benefit from marijuana is like the benefit from sugar some people like it its not actually that good for you and virtually everyone can live without it.

2187248,0,t1_clhhbi6,where I live there has been a good deal of theft recently.  Theft in general has continued unabated for many many years and it is far better than the murders that would be responded to in  or so. I now believe that there is very little fear instilled in many of the people that do lesser crimes in broad daylight in my district and surrounding area.  There should be some fear of arrest while you are doing the crime.  In the absence of that certain crime rises and rises and rises.  Basically criminals are allowed to operate.  I can give you  or  examples of corners that have been manned by drug dealers or gang people most working hours about noon to midnight maybe later in NE and NW.  I was on the phone with the police at the time that I was following him.  I was in a public area following him at a safe distance jogging then walking to match his pace.  Had he shot me that would have sucked.  I ended up putting myself in possible danger so that one of the individuals I am  sure is responsible for thefts in my immediate block could be caught. Mr. Zimmerman out of control and seems like a jackass but Im sure some of his mentality starts with what is going on here.  The real issue though is dispatch not putting a service request in.  when you call  you are not calling the police  you are calling their gate keeper.  I shouldnt have to do mental gymnastics to get them to respond to a crime in progress.  Now I feel like I know its not reality but there is something logically broken further upstream the message this is sending is  if you want something done about a crime in progress in a broad societal sense you have to apprehend and immobilize the perp before OUC will put your call though.  I had to go home in order to have them respond to this crime according to OUC.My eventual plan was that he was arrested by the many police around my immediate area rather and I was able to say  yep thats the guy that I saw stole a bike.

2394436,0,t3_2mtkug,In addition to what others have said pursue professional connections outside of formal networking events too. Since you have an MA hopefully you have a solid relationship with some grad school professors. In my experience they have connections in the field especially if you went to school in DC. Even if there arent any profs youre particularly close with just contact them anyway! This goes for any potential contact. Seek out interesting people in your field and ask them to get coffee or simply chat over email. The worst that can happen is you get no response  nothing to lose. Whats even better is to first pick out a few companiesagencies you want to work for andor that have positions open. Then see if theres anyone in your network that can put in a word for you. Professor that used to be a government official former boss or coworker who did a stint at a think tank etc. People love talking about themselves and asking them for help is immensely flattering. Plus doing favors makes people feel good look up the Ben Franklin Effect. And remember youre not asking others to help you out of the goodness of their heart  if you get a good job because of them now youre a good contact in their network. I only say this in case youre apprehensive about asking because it made me feel more confident to realize this. In practice it doesnt feel nearly so mercenary. Everyone in DC has been in your position I was there myself just a few months ago. All it takes is one good interview to turn things around. Youve gotten an apartment in DC right? Its kind of like that. There are plenty of spaces but getting the good ones is competitive. You have to put yourself out there a lot be aggressive but not insane hopefully and use any connections you have. ,washingtondc,cm7nrpm,2,t5_2qi2g

The votes do not count in actuality or in implementation. The will of the people of the District of Columbia holds less value in government decision making than the will of any other American citizen. In my opinion whether it is about marijuana abortion or whether or not we have to pay . more for a grocery bag the act of voting itself for the tax paying citizens of Washington D.C. is a farce to the members of the Federal Government.

On the  and  series cars the system runs directly from the VDC primary power bus. On all other car series the systems are powered by an auxiliary inverter that takes the VDC and converts it to phase VAC as a side note this is why you sometimes hear the blowers shut down as the train passes through a gap the inverter has to restart and sequence the loads in order of importance. The .VDC battery runs only a few emergency lights the radios and control logic. ,washingtondc,cnob69p,3,t5_2qi2g

Whether or not someone feels like tipping or if Uber says its necessary or not is semantics. Nothing resembling a tip is included in the fare. Also telling people with jobs to get a new job if it doesnt pay much is pretty fucking elitist dude. Its like telling poor people that all they have to do is not be poor.  I dont usually troll but this is ridiculous. Just admit Im right. ,washingtondc,coocxqp,1,t5_2qi2g
3149185,0,t1_coodbh4,Guy I simply came here to tell you that the tip isnt included in the fare this is getting out of hand. But Ill address your points.  Like I said no portion of the fare in any way whatsoever resembles a tip. Uber initially told people otherwise and it was a lie. There is currently a lawsuit regarding this fact. Indeed a while ago tips were probably not necessary as the pay was high enough that you did well even on a bad night. In the last  months Uber has cut the rates by more than half in many markets and the pay on many nights is sub minimum wage.  drivers are not employees of Uber they are independent contractors yet cannot set their own rates. There is also a lawsuit regarding employment status because of this. Also driver income is summed up on a  which classifies that income from a self employed business owner who is a sole proprietor. Drivers have no employer.  its elitist because youre basically saying that all people have to do to make more money is to simply make more money. And everybody who doesnt make a liveable wage only has themselves to blame. Well Walmart cant be blamed for paying people minimum wage if they didnt like it theyd find another job! They must be happy!Bottom line regarding tips let me see If I can use an analogy. Waitstaff at a restaurant make  an hour owner tells customers no tipping is necessary even though its standard in the industry because meal prices are high and he can pay the staff a decent wage. But then the owner wants to drum up business so he cuts the prices of the meals to draw more people in and pays wait staff less. This happens several times and now the wait staff are making several dollars an hour and the owner is still telling people not to tip. He doesnt care he wont see a penny of that money.

Anyway legally you only need  in property coverage  so not exactly excessive. As a Board member of my condo association I would have liked it to require far more to be honest.

A mild tangent is upcoming because people like to cause fusses over the process of checking IDs when its absolutely not necessary Valid forms of ID to prove your age include a state drivers license or identification card any of the  states or the District or U.S. Territory.  Living and working in DC Im sure Ive seen at least one from every state and DC.  I even came across one from Guam before but thats the only territory Ive seen.  Funny bit of trivia for nonAZ folk the Arizona licenses dont expire until your th birthday so there will be people at age  with a license that still has their picture from when they are .  Its hilarious.Also valid is of course your passport.  Any countrys passport is a legal form of ID and they are all as far as I am aware pretty similarly designed so all passports work as long as they arent expired.Lastly a consulate card or permanent resident card from Mexico is also considered valid.  A quick note on this though THIS DOESNT APPLY TO CANADA.  For whatever reason consulate cards or PR cards from Mexico are considered valid in the U.S. but Canada cards arent.  Who knows why.Thats about  of whats considered legal ID for verifying age in the US.  Canada DL or ID cards are not valid.  Australia DL or ID cards are not valid.  European Union cards are not valid.  IDs that are otherwise legal but that are expired are NOT VALID.  If your ID is expired and you cause a stink over it with the person checking your ID remember youre the asshole not them.  You had months to get your ID updated and you chose to delay the process until it cost you a night of drinking with your friends.Heres the one trick though about the entire process.  If youre unfamiliar with ABRA the DC name for the alcohol board they send people to restaurants and bars for the sole purpose of checking to see if bartenders and servers are asking for IDs.  If you are asking someone for an ID the ARBA representative automatically passes you even before you get to the point where you are looking at the ID.So what this means for me is that if someone looks young enough that I should ask for ID say  and younger and they pull out a foreign DL from Canada or the EU or Australia as long as I can recognize the DOB especially in a country with the date as DDMMYYYY instead of the American MMDDYYYY I usually let it slide.  Ill probably say something to the person along the lines of Im not supposed to accept this ID but I can tell you are  so youre good.  If you go out later though you should bring your passport because a bouncer at the door will most likely deny you.  That way they know the proper rules without getting in real trouble later.Usually as a rule of thumb I will ID everyone except for the males who are clearly over .  Unless a woman is clearly in her s she will most likely be flattered that you asked for their ID and sometimes a better tip will come out of it.  If someone gives me a hard time for IDing them I just kindly remind them that the fifteen seconds it takes for them to pull out their ID can be the difference between me keeping or losing my job.  For me personally  year old male with a babyface I hope I keep getting IDd until Im in my s.,washingtondc,cqbwozq,5,t5_2qi2g

3703128,0,t1_cqedphx,ampampamp Barrage jamming sfw gtBarrage jamming is radio jamming accomplished by transmitting a band of frequencies that is large with respect to the bandwidth of a single emitter. Barrage jamming may be accomplished by presetting multiple jammers on adjacent frequencies by using a single wideband transmitter or by using a transmitter capable of frequency sweep fast enough to appear radiating simultaneously over wide band e.g. a carcinotron Barrage jamming makes it possible to jam emitters on different frequencies simultaneously and reduces the need for operator assistance or complex control equipment. These advantages are gained at the expense of reduced jamming power at any given frequency Barrage jamming has to be used against frequencyagile radars which change frequencies too quickly to follow them in a conventional way. The use of barrage jamming may also affect the communications capability of the jamming source in a negative fashion. gtInteresting Radar jamming and deception | Backwardwave oscillator | USSS Electronic Countermeasures Suburban | Electronic countercountermeasure Parent commenter can toggle NSFWmessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcqedqk oror deletemessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot DeletionampmessageBdeletecqedqk.

3771736,0,t1_cqm0qp0,Anecdote a friend of mine is in his thirties walks without any tools and is tall and fairly muscular. However he has a spine injury due to getting badly beat up about  years ago so walking long distances can be painful. The muscles are mostly a result of physical therapy. While I admit I havent seen any doctors records about it the story never set off any bullshit meters and how he acts around the house is consistent with it. He has a handicapped sign for his car. I dont know how often he has to use it but I have no doubt that he has at least sometimes. If you saw him using it would you assume he had a problem you couldnt see in your  seconds of nonexpert observation or would you assume he was a fraud? If the latter would you act like a dick to him about it?I mean you probably wouldnt act like a dick to him since hes tall and muscular. But would you act like a dick to someone who seems easier to bully?Another anecdote my fatherinlaw and motherinlaw are ablebodied. My MILs cousin is not she can barely walk without a cane. She has a handicapped badge. If either of them drives her somewhere theyll probably park in the handicapped space. If they all arrive and leave together great Im sure everyone could tell whos handicapped. But when you drive anywhere do you ever forget something in the car and go back for it or leave someone somewhere and go do another errand? I know I do sometimes.

From the information given hes on a security detail and hes going to do what is necessitated to ensure the security of his detail.Certain agencies especially in dc have police powers that cross jurisdictional and state lines. WMATA have jurisdiction in  areas that they are allowed to enforce dc md va. Theyre usually allowed to stay within a certain vicinity of their territories so you arent gonna see wmata enforcing in white marsh md but perhaps within a few mile area of their stations. USPP are a federal agency however in terms of your local area they have areas that cover dc va and md as well and are allowed to enforce in the areas that they have jurisdiction over.It may so happen an area is covered by more than one agency so or isnt the sole jurisdiction of one area but may have three or four agencies that are allowed  to operate on it.You may ask why? Each agency has a mission. MPD is your local police force you call  and they show up. WMATA mission is to protect their assets buildings employees and customers. USPP is tasked with protecting the federal monuments and other lands under federal governance. Sometimes the areas covered are part of the mission of many agencies.,washingtondc,cs10v0e,4,t5_2qi2g

Thats all I can really say for sure.edit  Turns out it was a slow night.  I found another academic paper refuting the findings of Lotts study and other claims from his book More Guns Less Crime.  It refutes not only his primary claims that additional concealed handguns among a general population leads to a decrease in crime but also systematically explains why a lot of his methods are designed to produce a favored outcome and even his graphs and charts are misleading.The author of the paper Tim Lambert is a computer science professor without a dog in the race.Here also is a Science Blogs post by Lambert which picks apart Lotts methodology including the specific example of his incorrect use of regression estimates.I believe this is more or less what you asked for I didnt have to write it.,washingtondc,csejo9g,2,t5_2qi2g
4337950,0,t3_3ao4z9,Wherever you decide make sure to consider the cost of your commute. For instance if you take Metro remember that its distancebased and more expensive during rush hour. And if you have a car dont fall into the trap of thinking of that as a default cheap option that you dont think about the real cost of sit down and figure out what your commute would cost between gasinsuranceetc. Basically when looking at an apartment figure out your monthly community commuting costs and include that in your comparisons as rent. An apartment may look cheaper just on rent but be more expensive once you factor in commuting costs or one apartment may only really be  more expensive once commuting is accounting for at which point you may prefer to just drop the extra . Also weigh stuff like if you usually stay out late on weekends...youll probably learn to adapt quickly but if you dont Ubering from DC all the way up the Red Line will add up quick if you make a habit of it. And broadly speaking by moving farther out you decrease your rent but increase your commuting expenses. Try to live closer to work if at all possible basically unless you can get a straight shot on a single Metro line. For someone like you for instance Id look along the western side of the Red Line in DC theres some decent cheap housing there if you really look and get a bit of luck on your side. Short Metro ride to work and youre a lot closer to whee youll want to be on the weekends. ,washingtondc,csem7ic,6,t5_2qi2g

Following the recent surge the tone of the conversation surrounding violent crime has turned sharply toward wanting increased accountability from the system following arrests and generally toward favoring tougher penalties.  Several members of my local listserv who were victims of violent crimes have followed their perpetrators cases closely and been very vocal about how the system has failed them.  On person in particular was carjacked by an armed duo one of whom was on pretrial release who were then both again released on pretrial release.  Their cases subsequently were pled down to nonviolent offenses.  Increasingly there is a sense that MPD is actually quite good at arresting violent criminals but that the policies in place further down the line of the justice system leave them playing catch and release particularly with respect to violent juvenile offenders.  ,washingtondc,cvlule0,7,t5_2qi2g

5952506,0,t1_cxzux8k,The only person here that needs to look up the definition here is you sweetie.gt trafficgtverbgtgerund or present participle traffickinggt    deal or trade in something illegal.That said I cant find that the DC Criminal Code even has a statue for firearms trafficking specifically. The closest here would be  . Unlawful possession of firearm but he plead guilty to attempted seconddegree cruelty to children and possession of an unregistered firearm. The only major difference I can see is that the former has a mandatory sentencing requirement of one year. The latter two do not and I suspect the former may be a felony. The latter two appear to be misdemeanors but DCs criminal code doesnt exactly make it clear what class individual crimes fall under.Is what he did illegal? Yes. Im not disputing that but you were stating what he did was trafficking which it is not. At minimum hes indirectly responsible for what happened.gtBut prosecutors did charge a yearold male who admitted to bringing the loaded mm Glock pistol to the boys apartment. Inside the apartment the yearold found the gun in a bag and began playing with it.Perhaps he could have taken precautions that wouldve prevented the boy from having access to the bag but putting the responsibility of what happened on him is the definition of stupid. He had zero intention of committing murder. Motorists kill cyclists by the hundreds on accident annually and many do not ever result in criminal charges being pressed. The only difference here is that a gun was used instead of a motor vehicle.Your argument is weak and misinformed while your understanding of the concept of justice is childish at best. We get it you dont like guns and have a very authoritarian and unreasonable interpretation of criminal laws and sentencing. While DC does have a major gun crime problem and there are many people let go that shouldnt be like some of the early  year old kids mugging people at gunpoint this is not one of those situations.,washingtondc,cxzwjm5,-5,t5_2qi2g

6013238,0,t1_cy7ubhf,Id argue it matters a great deal. We as a country spend billions upon billions of dollars imprisoning people. A greater percentage of our population is locked up than any other country in the world. And yet despite the disproportionate numbers of black people both imprisoned and killed by police despite the innate distrust they have of the police and justified fear of arrest inculcated in them virtually since birth there are still those who go out and beat random strangers on the Metro.So we send them to jail once theyve committed the crime. Wonderful. But imprisoning them doesnt stop those who havent been imprisoned from doing the same thing. It doesnt address the systemic economic inequalities that I would argue are the root cause of the mindset that eventually leads one to think Im bored. Better fuck this guy up. Id argue that simply imprisoning people and getting tough on crime by increasing police presence profiling and allowing concealed carry permits exacerbate the underlying issue even if they would lead to a nominal decrease in actual crime statistics by pushing the poor largely black population further into the margins of society creating more resentment and leading to more expressions of inchoate rage against a system that is quite pointedly stacked against them.

One lane of th Street is pretty much constantly block by delivery trucks. They get tickets but the companies just eat the cost as part of doing business.

7455902,0,t3_4hhmx4,I live in Southwest and commute to Fairfax everyday for work. I was in the exact same situation got out of school and desperately wanted to work amp live in the city but I needed a job and the offer came from Fairfax.Is it worth it? Yeah definitely. My commute is about  minutes from Waterfront to Vienna and then another  minutes on a bus that drops me off in front of my office. If youre commuting to Tysons itll be even easier since there is no bus involved assuming you work near the metro. The cost of the commute is kind of high since Im taking the max metro everyday but its probably still less than car payment insurance parking and gas. Bonus point since youre riding the opposite way of most people your train is almost never crowded.  I get out of work around  and get home around  which gives plenty of time to do chores rec sports shopping eating out etc. Going out on the weekends and not worrying about how Im getting home is amazing. Being able to decide on a whim to go to the zoo or the museums or just roam around is great. I highly recommend it.,washingtondc,d2pot9t,3,t5_2qi2g

Dating in DC is extremely hard especially for women.My girlfriends and I are constantly having conversations about the dating scene here. Like you we are successful educated and attractive yet we all have had such a difficult time finding quality guys to date. The guys we liked would ghost on us or just be emotionally unavailable and the guys that liked us were less than thrilling. That being said finding someone is not impossible it just takes time!! Personally I never liked OKC because I got a lot of messages from people I wasnt interested in. I preferred tinderhingebumble because you can only message with people if you both like each other. Bumble was my favorite I actually met my current boyfriend on there!! This was after YEARS of dating unsuccessfully. Keep at it!! I wish you the best of luck!! Also if you have any bad dating stories that you want to share please forward them my way!!

Its easy cash. They also like to pimp all these shared resources like the roof meeting space and room with a TV marketed as theater crap while charging sqft yearly for the tiny living space. Its a sign of the times that residential space is often more expensive than grade A office space.The companies hold the rent high because theyre going to resell or dump the properties.

You can ask here and elsewhere but people will typically have conflicting and unhelpful opinions. Really the best way to evaluation your comfort with a neighborhood is to go visit.  FWIW Ivy City This is a stupid place to live. Its totally isolated and inconvienient. Its a good place to Uber to once a month for drinking. Shaw Dense neighborhood close to downtown. Lots of bars and restaurants convenient to many nightlife and work locations. Lots of nice rowhouses and new apt buildings also some public housing with safety issues. Areas near universities i.e. Catholic U Howard DC U etc. Uhm those are three different neighborhoods in totally different parts of town. SW? We know to steer clear of SE...but whats the deal with SW? Okay youre going off the rails here. There are some fancynice parts of SE. SW is close to down town and has a lot of new development but is soulless and boring. It a best case scenario it will be the new Penn Quarter in  years. any other safedangerous areas to know about?

The distillery next to Blue mountain was neat and there are so many wineries. My personal opinion is skip Veritas and head to Cardinal Point... but only personal taste. If you can manage getting out there by Saturday morning the farmers market at the base of Wintergreen is a must visit. They have coffee and pastries and live bluegrass in addition to the norm.

8635887,0,t1_d6km359,gtI wonder how many people choose where to bank based on the banks firearm policies? Serious question.Surprisingly not even me. As much as I hate that stupid policy and that asshole who could have been a whole lot nicer in his letter I seriously would have accepted something like your second paragraph This is really just so that no one is additionally unnecessarily gets injured instead of Wahh! I dont have to! How dare you question my supreme leadership? I still have  of my finances with NFCU because their customer service is generally very good the CD rates are unparalleled and insert a bunch of other were not shitty BofA that make it a worthwhile trade off. Besides Virginia law does not grant any sort of legal authority to their no guns rule so I carry in the branches anyway just in case shit does hit the fan.gt I would feel safer in a bank that did not allow guns. A customer who had a firearm attempting to stop a robbery would greatly increase the chances that someone gets shot. Its better to give the thief the money and call the police.Youre certainly entitled to that opinion and its one Ive seen several times on this sub  generally an assumption that those who would be carrying arent well trained enough to be trying to be vigilantes. However Id argue that people who take CCW classes and get permits go through more training and have better aim than most police officers. I do however understand an argument for not letting employees carry because then it could be the banks fault if an employee tried to be a vigilante and failed the bank could be sued. If a customer takes matters into his own hands and is wrong that person will be sued not the bank.,washingtondc,d6l3dg9,1,t5_2qi2g

8729614,0,t1_d6wu0sf,Yeah my awful commute was to Bethesda from pretty near downtown DC. For the last couple month I gave up on the metro and started bicycling out there so at least there was something fun about it but even that was too monotonous. I had colleagues who would drive over two hours each way from West Virginia. My God. To beat traffic they worked an early schedule starting at am. That means they were up at  or earlier every morning. What kind of life is that? Wake up at am shower have breakfast drive from  to  work until pm get home after pm cook eat have less than an hour to relax and then back in bed.I think people really have some bad false economies when it comes to commute time. Ten percent of their lives sitting in traffic mostly stressed and sometimes irate. All to save some money on a house they barely had a chance to see.After my own experience and seeing how bad the same rationale could make things for others I resolved never to have any commute longer than a minute bike ride. That was almost  years and many jobs ago. Turns out that when you set a goal like that and really stick to it it works.,washingtondc,d6wuglm,19,t5_2qi2g

What Ill say about Trinidad that hasnt already been said here is that it still varies a lot from block to block. Overall the residents here are wonderful people but there is at least one gang that deals drugs on two corners in the neighborhood. However if you look at the type of violent crime that occurs its overwhelmingly related to buyingselling drugs. So if you arent doing either of those things youll be safe. Get to know your neighbors. The guys hanging out on the corners seem much less intimidating when you know that one of them is named Mike and lives with his aunt who had a stroke last year. That same guy watches out for the guy next door who were all worried is developing Alzheimers. Or that his cousin paints houses and will give you a good deal since you live on the block. Or that the house they hang out in front of belongs to a lady who grows the BIGGEST basil plants youve ever seen. If you compliment her on them shell go into her house and emerge with one just for you. I know  of the people on my street and it really feels like a community rather than an anonymous city street.

In NYC all the Via vehicles are Expeditions Suburbans etc. high end vehicles with rd row seating. And since they seat  people they can be classified as commuter vans at least thats my understanding. The problem in DC is that the ridesharing market is dominated by either people using their own cars or people whove invested in cars like Camrys not for hire vehicles like in NYC.

Typically when a robbery or other violent crime happens outside of targeted shootings its a black kid attacking  robbing  etc a white victim. Unfortunately these are never classified as hate crimes because society has trained us to think those only go one direction. DC as a city and government is literally run by black people in virtually every office of power but yet you still hear constant complaints from those not doing well about The Plan by whites to oppress them.

They substitute for actual zoning data by drawing a conclusion based on lowerthanexpected rates of spatial growth in highdensity cities.There are some leaps in logic here but none seem egregious. The authors assume that the lost GDPincome is attributable to housing supply shortages. And they assume that housing shortages are attributable to zoning restrictions.

9319725,0,t1_d8x84ev,Its really hard to do well and a lot of the Brutalist buildings people are familiar with were basically built as bunkers to be able to withstand race riots. The Metro stations are the rare good example but you have to look at the original downtown stations the cladding on the wallsceiling isnt as nice in later stations. Also the improved lighting not that I dont understand the need for improved lighting is ruining the effect not just because the vibe works better with less lighting but because theyre installing this drop lighting that is completely out of context for the architecture. editSo actually I think the stations did originally have better lighting and the light fixtures are now just covered in grime that blocks a lot of light. So that would negate my point about darkness being the intended effect although it certainly did do a lot to hide the flaws in how the stations have been maintained but not my point about the new lighting being completely out of place architecturally.editOn yet further reflection where the light is coming from does matter too the light was definitely not supposed to be illuminating the walls from the middle of the stations.,washingtondc,d8xcdcb,5,t5_2qi2g

9457128,0,t1_d9ektmp,This sounds good at first glance but you should remember that improvements to transportation networks affect everyone who uses any kind of transportation...so also everyone who consumes things in the region. If fewer people take metro because of higher prices then more people will drive on an already stressed road network. Having an effective road network is important to everyone and paid for by both gas taxes and general tax revenues. An effective mass transportation network can more efficiently use the roads and move more people with at least one effect being that emergency services can move around the roads more easily. That sounds like a worthwhile use if general tax funds.Metro is a tough situation because it depends on general revenue from three different political entities plus the feds really. A dedicated funding stream would allow it to plan better for future expenses and hopefully conduct maintenance in a more timely manner not having to wait for allocated funds provided by three different groups of politicians.,washingtondc,d9erb4o,6,t5_2qi2g

9867862,0,t3_5gnt3p,I had jury duty in DC earlier this year and was selected for a criminal trial.  They took us down to the courtroom within about half an hour of settling into the lounge so not a lot of waiting in my case. We went through a very convoluted process of numbering off and lines being formed etc. We eventually moved into the courtroom and filled out the seats  due to my number I happened to be sitting in the jury box. The judge had us answer a variety of questions by show of hands e.g. whether you have been to law school then summoned each person who raised his or her hand at least once to discuss quietly with the judge and counsel. It was pretty obvious that a lot of people were scrambling to convince the judge to dismiss them and many succeeded. I was tempted to do the same but also felt pretty curious about serving on the jury. After much shuffling around I was indeed selected.  The case dealt with a gun possession charge and lasted about  days. The actual trial took about half of that time and was honestly very interesting. There was a lot of dry procedural elements and downtime where we had to shuffle in and out of the courtroom but I enjoyed seeing how everything plays out in a nonTV criminal case the answer far less dramatically.  The next couple of days after the trial were spent deliberating. Our jury was split and couldnt reconcile so we basically just had to sit in the small jury room uncomfortable for hours on end. Occasionally we would file into the courtroom and tell the judge we were hung and she would read a statement that basically admonished us to figure it out.  After a few days of that torture the judge finally declared a mistrial. We went back to the jury room and the lawyers from both sides were allowed to come back with us and ask us questions about our decision or lack thereof. That was actually pretty interesting as they were able to share with us evidence that wasnt admissible in the case but wouldve made it a  minute decision.,washingtondc,datszxm,2,t5_2qi2g

9882282,0,t1_davm5xc,I think the issue is less about Trump is saying and more about the doubts that some people have had over the consistency and clarity of his stated beliefs. You may not have observed this but a lot of people feel that his statements on many policy issues are relatively inconsistent and hard to interpret even by politician standards.To take an example he once tweeted that clinate change was a hoax and has frequently expressed doubts about anthropogenic global warming including and significantly threatening to withdraw from the Paris Accords and appointing a climate change skepticdenier to head the EPA. But he has also at different times suggested that he would consider remaining in the Paris Accords and has personally taken action to protect some of his business interests from the Now I dont think theres anything wrong changing your mind on an issue as new facts come out. I loathe the term flip flopped to smear someone who learns and grows as a person. And Trump is far from the only politician to change his views over time. But I cant really pretend not to be at least a little confused as to where Trump stands on these key issues. While another politician might change their mind over the course of months he changes his mind from conversation to conversation days or hours apart.

10121549,0,t1_dbqt8ig,I think you might be a little unaware of the political prominence of these church communities. Youre portraying it as a MarylandVirginia vs. DC issue and maybe it is in some ways but thats clearly not what DC elected officials are seeing and its important to be aware of these historical trends and political power players since in many ways those divisions are more prominent and meaningful than the jurisdiction lines that separate DC from the suburbs. The leaders of these congregations wield significant influence even if you dont think that enough of the actual parishioners eat at neighborhood restaurants. Youre also dealing with some perceptions that are very widespread in my experience the idea that bikes are mostly for yuppies and that bike lanes are a form of creeping gentrification that displaces longterm and particularly lowincome residents in these neighborhoods. The narrative that arises from this is that the bike lane project is yet another project that mostly benefits rich yuppies and inconveniences longtime residents and the working class. Its hard to counteract those narratives and I dont think that trying to spin it into a DC vs MDVA thing will work since... well... most people dont frame it that way.Im really frustrated by the slow pace of the bike lane projects here though dont get me wrong. I think that this is actually a systematic problem with any kind of construction project in this region though whenever you try to develop anything in DC or near DC  whether its a large project like a light rail system or something small like a protected bike lane  you cant avoid kicking over a beehive of special interest groups and complex regulations that makes it  frankly intimidating and painfully slow to get anything done.

Its for that reason that I understand why MPD is following a nochase policy for the time being but I hope they can find another way to curb this that is less dangerous for the officers and the kids.

10277915,0,t1_dc8zq4y,I think MPD needs to put an end to this too.  But there is obviously some racism stoking the fire.  And your sarcastic quote actually depicts how many people think unfortunately. For example one commenter above claimed that these are the same assholes from the documentary The TwelveoClock Boys and then proceeded to accuse them of  largely stealing their bikes and murdering a woman a year or two ago.  Based on what proof?  Not every group of black people doing something together is a violent gang.Someone else referred to them as worthless degenerates.  But decent people with respectable jobs and families are into the biker thing.  They save up to buy their own bikes and ATVs.  They talk about tech specs and races with their friends coworkers and kids and use it as a way to socialize and let loose just like any other hobby.  Now the issue is that the biker nonsense isnt just any other hobby.  But again the problems with it just dont warrant casting all participants as wretched murderous criminalsLike streetracing this is a deeply antisocial hobby thatat bestinconveniences people on roads and sidewalks who just dont deserve to be inconvenienced.  That alone is why this practice needs to end.  But please.  Causing that inconvenience hardly justifies dehumanizing the offenders as people here tend to do. Like streetracing the organizers attempts to make the hobby safe fail systematically.  They think that by having lookouts at the front and back attempt to block traffic while the stunts are done the only people at risk are the riders themselves.  But that just isnt true.  The road blocks are hopelessly lossy especially when it comes to pedestrians.  And if they worked theyd still be ridiculously antisocial as described above.  But here too their failure to internalize the safety concerns means that they need to be stopped but hardly makes them wretched murderous criminals.The fact that these events have attracted bad apples in the past actually do justify a police crackdown.  I mean bad apples ruining the fun of decent people is the unfortunate history of law and order.  This doesnt mean the good apples are bad people though and theres no reason to treat them as such as we search for a solution to the problem.,washingtondc,dc92337,1,t5_2qi2g

10345885,0,t1_dcgmh0n,As do I in a perfect world we could all purse our own interests and serve who we want to serve without hurting and coercion into morally acceptable business practice could be only social pressure. For the sake of your argument I will approach it from and individual liberties point of view. First we need to establish that sometime the system of social coercion fails to result in moral behavior and sometimes encourages immoral behavior. I agree business that get labeled as bigoted dont usually last long. My concern is the business that do bigoted things or encouraged bigoted ideas that dont get that label or at least dont take too much heat for itonce again ChickfilA with gay marriage. Furthermore US history is filled with examples of times when social coercion encourged morally wrong things. The best modern examples are social coercion women experience to not enter high paying competitive fieldsthis is in decline and the social coercion hr reps feels when they see black sounding names when giving call backs for jobsblack people get less interviews than equally qualified white people. Another good example is in housing where black peopleminorities find it harder to find good housing when compared to equivalent white peoplefor example DC has a team devoted to fighting landlordsleasing agents who differentially offer housing on the market based on race. So sometimes social pressure not only fails to enforce moral behaviorrespecting others basic right to equally service in this case but also can encourage inequality and immoral behavior. So next we have why is it ok for the government to step in and stop this and in doing so violated the individual liberties of the bigoted company or individual? Ill justify this from a market based individual liberties perspective since that seems to be the perspective you are coming from. If markets are functioning properly people should earn what their labor is worth. They provide that labor by obtaining other servicesbasic stuff for survival such as food and housing as well as prerequisites for the labor the person does for example education appropriate clothing tools and equipment. They obtain these services by using what they earn with their labor. If those services arent provided equally and fairly it harms an individuals ability to learn a more valuable form of laborsay getting electrician training. This goes for any of those services for example if black people have a harder time finding good housing it harms their ability to reinvest in themselves and thus harms their ability to learn a more valuable form of labor. This is compounded because the usual targets of bigotry already face discrimination. The kicker is that this harms everyone because potentially talented individual never get to contribute their labor because they never had the resources to get trained. Therefore government intervention is justified to restore a competitive and free market for the benefit of all. So in short government intervention is justified because social pressure is inadequate and bigoted distribution of services contributes to a producing a nonfree labor market harming the productivity of that market. ,washingtondc,dcgrk2b,0,t5_2qi2g

But rather than permit operators to selectively override this system when they encounter problems Metro instead opted to just completely disable the system on all cars.I havent had a chance to look up this particular incident yet but Ill put  bet that it was a  or  series car in the lead. All other cars use recessed door control buttons to prevent accidental operation. But the s and s use a protruding button with a bezel surrounding it. Operators hate the bezel because it takes more effort to push the button when its installed. So over the years operators have been breaking them and removing them. The vast majority of cars are now missing these protective bezels. ,washingtondc,dcxzcg0,2,t5_2qi2g

Since I was a Fed for a many years before I had kids and since I generally try to avoid going to the doctor I built up and have maintained a sufficient balance and have actually never paid outofpocket for anything including no copays. And this has covered my family through the birth of two children and their medical expenses whichboth preventative care and sick visits and emergency roomare larger than mine.

I basically was the person who reached out to them to hang out rather than waiting for them to contact me. Not all of my friends live in dc like me and some people fell through but after a bit I found people who are willing to come to dc to hang out or live here.

11023657,0,t1_dehi2cj,TLDR  Type in  for proper formattingActual replyFor the      like you were trying for you need three backslashes so it should look like this when you type it out     which will turn out like this The reason for this is that the underscore character this one   is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does this guy  .  Since the face of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the face this guy  .  The backslash is reddits escape character basically a character used to say that you dont want to use a special character in order to format but rather you just want it to display.  So your first  is just saying hey I dont want to italicize  so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since its just an escape character.  After this you still want the arm so you have to add two more backslashes two not one since backslash is an escape character so you need an escape character for your escape character to displayconfusing I know.  Anyways I guess thats my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lolCAUTION Probably very boring edit as to why you dont need to escape the second underscore read only if youre super bored or need to fall asleep.Edit The reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore which doesnt have an escape character doesnt have another underscore with which to italicize.  Reddits formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text then you put the text you want to format then you put the character again.  For example you would type italicize or italicize in order to get italicize.  Since we put an escape character we have italicize and dont need to escape the second underscore since theres not another nonescaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them.  So technically you could have written  but you dont need to since theres not a second nonescaped underscore.  You would need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line but not if you used a line break aka pressed enter twice.  If you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the nonescaped underscore to italicize.  To show you this you can type italicize and it should not be italicized.,washingtondc,dehi2f0,1,t5_2qi2g
11027965,0,t3_5xch1l,Ive been to every station at least once in the past  years including the Silver one even though thats new. Theres something enchanting about a train system that can take you anywhere for a few bucks while you do nothing so dont judge me yo. To be honest most end stations have nothing on the intermediary stations since most of them are just elaborate parking garages catering to those wholl work closer to the city. BUT every single one is different and does tangentially include a little bit of the surrounding areas history and culture. Fraconia is a stopgap between some residential and far more commercial land in a cramped spot so the station itself is part of a bridge between a commerce train station and the rest of Springfield for example. Vienna from the last time I went there is between many highways and is thusly multilayered. List goes on.Its probably more interesting to figure out why the Red line is always on fire while being flooded. Or why Rosslyn smells,washingtondc,dehztp3,3,t5_2qi2g

We hold hands going in we cancel out each others votes and then we hold hands going back home.    We make it work just because we choose to love each other more than we love our respective political parties.  I respect that shes an intelligent woman who can look over the data and make a decision for herself and she respects that Im an intelligent man who can do the same.    To be fair it does help that were both relatively moderate socially and were mostly opposed fiscally.  She works for a government organization and is directly involved with helping local communities so I see the good that government programs can offer and Im a smallbusiness owner so she sees the overwhelming headache that large bureaucracy can create for the little guy.    We only realistically have  parties to choose from in the US so just automatically assuming a lot about someone just based on how they vote is silly to me.

11764640,0,t1_dgsfz89,Youre not getting my point. The reason people dislike public unions is because theres no and there cant be a la carte taxation.  You are compelled to pay for all the services. And if a public union chooses to go on strike theyre refusing to do what everyones paying them to do. Which is bad.  If airline employees go on strike its no skin off my nose because Ill get a refund on my ticket or the airline will put me on a different carrier.  I pay for WMATA if they go on strike are they going to pay for my transit on another form?,washingtondc,dgtjvcd,2,t5_2qi2g

11782219,0,t1_dgvdkod,If you have a cold or a simple  hour flu going to the doctors office is of absolutely zero benefit and in fact endangers other less healthy people who might have to use the same public facilities you are using think children and the elderly.Scheduling a doctors appointment ahead of time is fine but my understanding is that this was about people calling in on a day when they are sick.  They apparently still have the stupid mentality of the Army which forces you to go see the doctor any time you take a sick day.  The doctor gets his time wasted you dont get the rest you need and everyone ends up unhappy.  Its really the dumbest of polices.,washingtondc,dgvjwk4,15,t5_2qi2g
