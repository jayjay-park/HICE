5168095,0,t3_3lrxk5,gt The controllers were tricky for me to figure out in the short time available for the demo  there were a lot of buttons and dials. They were not intuitive at least not for someone like me. Maybe other folks who routinely play games that use those crazy controllers with thousands of buttons and levers will have an easier time.WTH the SteamVRControllers have only  Buttons on them one of them being a SteamTouchpad which you couldnt even use in most demos.EDIT I know there are actually more than  buttons but the HTC demos which he refers to dont use them ,HTC_Vive,cv8y24y,3,t5_39zaz

You can even create and add your own if you enjoy photogrammetry.There are some nice meditation apps coming out and Ethan Carter is a beautiful game reworked for VR that has a lot of gorgeous calm places where you can sit and enjoy.,HTC_Vive,d8t1a6b,1,t5_39zaz
