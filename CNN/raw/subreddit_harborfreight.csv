10058094,0,t3_5jmnlp,I have that trailer in its outofthebox configuration and love it.  I built a fence out of PT xs for all four sides so i can load up things that dont strap down so well and so far Im VERY happy with it.I cant speak for turning it into a camper but as a utility trailer it definitely gets the job done. My only real gripe honestly is that the wiring is really bad.  I ended up rewiring a bunch of mine so far because the wires had actually corroded from the inside and were no longer actually carrying current.   But as others have said and will say after me you cant beat it for the price!,harborfreight,dbile7u,2,t5_2w2q9
