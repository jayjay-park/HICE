499271,0,t3_1z3wz8,Ive played quite a bit of it and I cant say its perfect however it doesnt have a very large price tag. It was definitely worth the money I payed given all of the different game types and the dynamic style of play. The only thing is that the learning curve kinda sucks sometimes. You just have to be prepared to fail more than a couple of times for stupid reasons. Once you get it down though its a lot of fun. The longer you play the more content just appears in the forms of dungeons and new enemy types. And a lot of times youll find that your badass strategy worked until you discovered that further into the game there are flaming fucking bat demons that fly over your walls and rape your population. My main complaint though is that if you fail in endgame it takes a while to get back to where you were. The villagers are essential to success and their AI can be clunky sometimes. But an FYI stick to making your guy badass until you can get some helpers. Also the time slow and speed up orbs are pretty important for growing food and preparing your base for each next wave.,BaseBuildingGames,cfx0r2b,1,t5_2uapd

Its an amazingly fun game which goes to show that well done mechanics and UI can overcome graphical restrictions any day which is kind of why Dwarf Fortress is still so popular even with next to no graphics at all. I too recommend RimWorld if you like colony management and base defense! ,BaseBuildingGames,d07895x,3,t5_2uapd

But then you say another game is ugly and that doesnt make it fun  how is that relevant? Hes just saying the graphics arent the intensive thing about the game.In my own opinion ARK is ugly af.

10340340,0,t3_5n3301,Planet Explorers is a first person or third base builder with a storyline and world or random generated sandbox that lets you recruit NPCs. Two NPCs can follow you and dozens can live in your colony performing whatever tasks you assign them to. As for base building it is a voxel game that allows you a lot of creativity in building structures but uniquely that Im aware of it lets you design your own weapons and vehicles as well and their performance is based on your designs. As for the colony building you place prefabs that perform specific functions like a power generator or a repair bench. Thats the same idea as Fallout but in Fallout there are more miscellaneous things like decor or small scale items. If you liked placing the individual rugs and paintings Planet Explorers isnt that. But it should definitely be considered if you like the idea of building a bunch of different work benches and telling your NPC recruits to go harvest plants chop trees mine ore nurse each other back to health defend the colony etc. If you like the idea of designing your own swords helicopters trucks tanks or guns then Planet Explorers is great.,BaseBuildingGames,dcg4x5z,2,t5_2uapd

At this point hes simply adding more and more features that other developers would call paidDLC.Kenshi is an early access game in a more traditional sense. Its got a huge open world lots of things to do but not a very strong gameplay loop. It definitely feels like things are missing and you notice the earlyaccess status of the game quite often while playing it. But I agree with others here that it has an extremely unique playstyle and has nothing else quite like it.Aside from that Rimworld is the vastly superior of the two when it comes to pure gameplay.,BaseBuildingGames,dd1stu2,6,t5_2uapd

11077754,0,t3_5y218h,Gnomoria is worth a buy Towns is not.Gnomoria scratches the itch of basebuilding and has enough depth to tinker with it for quite some time.While I would have loved for it to continue everonward as Dwarf Fortress has it is feature complete and relatively bugfree most people wont have problems.  The game had a lot going for it even before it left early access and nothing feels particularly rushed or halfimplemented.  Building complex waterworks moats giant excavations these are all neat little tasks...but the game is bit short on actual personality.  It treat it more like a Lego set than an ant farm.  Im rarely surprised by what the gnomes do.Castle Story is an okay option and while  development updates are frequent the changes seem insignificant.Having recently started Oxygen Not Included it has akay charm decent gameplay but its very early in development.  Theres a ton of stuff missing not working properly and buggy.  To its credit though I have yet to have the game crash on me.  Still after about ten hours of tinkering over a few days Im backing away from it until more is added.,BaseBuildingGames,dennj2u,3,t5_2uapd
11340878,0,t1_dfhgekm,Good question! The flagpole feature is the ability to upload your settlments for other players to explore and loot  and do the same yourself with the creations of other players via turnbased tactical battles in a dungeon crawl style adventure. The game runs very close to Dwarf Fortress with a lot of its features which is where Rimworld had its own inspiration from too before now ending up as its own unique gem of gaming and Im planning to do the same. Well also have a lot more of a focus on the economy and production chains akin to The Settlers games so rather than just directly mining steel out of walls a la Rimworld therell be a long and involved chain of production to produce it from base materials. Thats not very exciting by itself but Im hoping to capture some of the peaceful magic of the early Settlers games in this way.I think both by having the differing racesfactions with their unique gameplay and mechanics as well as the ability to go on adventures into the locations of these other races there should evolve almost a metagame of interesting dungeoncrawl adventures born out of the base game of building up a settlement.,BaseBuildingGames,dfhgvyb,11,t5_2uapd
11353280,0,t1_dfij57c,Its definitely a problem to address! While the player will designate guard patrols posts maybe traps and where things are stored the game will take those and redistribute and balance things to give more of a progression through a settlement  so no easy loot at the entrance that kind of thing. Its not like youre going to fight through the entire population of anothers settlement instead itll take their characters as input and decide how many and where theyre going to be placed.I think traps may be the trickiest thing to handle  no fun exploring somewhere if every inch of it is covered in traps so again the game will take what exists on the map as input and mix things up choose how many to place and in which concentrations to keep things somewhat balanced and enjoyable.,BaseBuildingGames,dfivg45,1,t5_2uapd
