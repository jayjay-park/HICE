336846,0,t1_cffkxcb,His leg was fractured in half at the femur due to osteosarcoma. We found out taking him to the vet for the limp and it had already spread to his lungs and he was in sooooo much pain the vet and the oncologist both said there nothing we could really due that would give him any semblance of a quality of life. It absolutely crushed me. He was the best dog Ive ever met and my soul mate. I was planning adventures until he was old and gray muzzled. ,Rottweiler,cffona7,2,t5_2qrmj

1091907,0,t3_26lgsm,Try some confidence building type stuff like obstacle courses you guys can run together.  Also regular training just the two of you or with family and friends but also with other dogs.  About the timidity and submissiveness around other dogs its important to be careful about the situations you put her in at the dog park. Finding the right dog to play with is important for a good experience. Perhaps some one on one play dates with another dog you know she gets on well with might be less overwhelming for her.  A lot of times at the park my Lab Rottie will be having a great time with another dog but then a third tries to get involved and it changes the chemistry.  Just keep an eye out during those moments and be prepared to intervene when you see she is not having a good time. Dogs learn through experience and conditioning.  The more good experiences she has the more her timidity will give way to confidence in herself.  Also thinking about it it took Higgins my dog a while to become confident in us too.  I thought itd be a right away kind of thing but really he took the best part of a year to really bond with us.  Its a process and the more your dog can feel confident in you the more confident it will feel overall.  ,Rottweiler,chsej4s,3,t5_2qrmj
1824544,0,t3_2ffy8h,No. They are great dogs. They are smart and loyal. I would say two things Socialize the dog as soon as the parvo series is finished Rotties are very susceptible to parvo.

3134472,0,t3_2vj6fc,Im a little late to the game but I feel ya.  I adopted my Mervin when he was  weeks old and immediately started socializing himAdults children other dogs cats the whole nine.  Hes super friendly and very energetic and he loves everyone and everything forever.  Hes almost  now and still super energetic.My mom tried to convince me that I shouldnt play tug with him because it will make him aggressive.  What the damn hell lady?People always give me a hard time about him.  I had him offlead at a park he was just trotting along next to me happy as you please Hes very very good at being offleash.  Every walk is a training sessionI practice his offlead commands and hes very good at it. and some lady gives me the stinkeye and says You need to put that dog on a leash.  Im afraid of it.  My dog wasnt anywhere NEAR her.  Something like this happens at least once a week.Although reading through some of the other comments I do agree that theres always a small element of risk to owning a large breed.  Ive been headpunched in the face so many times its almost funny.  Were playing and he jerks the wrong way and suddenly Ive got a split lip.  Hes jumping onto the bed or the couch and Im leaning down for whatever reason and he slams into my nose.  Poor guy always feels really bad but it happens.  Its not because hes aggressive its because hes clumsy.  The same thing happens when you have kids.Hes always VERY GENTLE with small dogs and children.  Hes slow and calm and wellbehaved because he knows he could hurt them.  About a year ago he met this ITTY BITTY TEENY little puppy who looked like a german shepherd of some sort and the poor thing was terrified of him.  So my puppy just sort of...propped his chin next to the little guy and let this bitty thing sniff him all over.  Then they were best friends.,Rottweiler,comvvv0,2,t5_2qrmj
3249845,0,t3_2x82o4,Thanks! We totally lucked out with him. Usually you cant find purebreds at the Humane Society. He is well mannered a bit submissive and we are still figuring out commands that he learned before coming to live with us. I cant wait to take him to obedience school because he just loves to please and is so smart.,Rottweiler,coyus7a,2,t5_2qrmj

8693499,0,t1_d6s8lqs,It all starts with limiting excitement from the moment you get the leash and put it on and maintaining that level. Even if it takes you  minutes to get the leash on and walk out the door without him being excited thats arguably a better exercise for him than pulling you on the leash for  minutes where he is essentially exercising dominance over you and not showing you respect.Once you get out the door Simply put if hes trying to walk ahead you dont move forward. Correct and stop. Go the other way. If he gets in front again repeat. Youre going to have to channel your inner zen master. It will be hard at first but the more you do it the easier it will become. Once he understands that youre leading and hes following walking will become FUN. It will FILL you with energy and empower you instead of draining you because youre fighting your dog through the leash the whole time.You chose a powerful headstrong breed that requires a lot of work and it takes a lot to earn their respect but thats part of what makes them the best dogs out there good luck,Rottweiler,d6sbfbw,7,t5_2qrmj
