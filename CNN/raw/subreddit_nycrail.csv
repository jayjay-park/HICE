5816644,0,t1_cxi1nle,Unlike newer systems most sections of tunnel in the system are very close to the surface in many cases just a few feet under the street. Sidewalk grates combined with air movement driven by trains provide adequate ventilation without the need for powered systems. Asphyxiation is not really possible as a result.Underriver tubes and deep level tunnels in upper manhattan have fan plants that are used to ventilate the tunnels. Fan plants are some of the most intensively maintained pieces of NYC Subway infrastructure. Nobody sees them but theyre always running and maintenance workers are always paying attention to them. Sometimes lines have to be closed on weekends to bring in a replacement part do heavy work etc.,nycrail,cxi3xps,8,t5_33me2

8316072,0,t3_4tfe4a,Im all for the open car design. I really liked that about the London and Paris systems.USB ports? Whos going to use them? Wont that just increase petty theft? Sounds cool but probably entirely impractical. If it were a commuter rail line Id be all for it but I rarely wind up taking single train trips long enough to justify plugging my phone in.Im ambivalent about the security cameras but NYC is much safer than it used to be. Using new dangers to justify them is just paranoid.,nycrail,d5h2d5y,2,t5_33me2

10263005,0,t1_dc7c5mj,While I did just read about the difference in trip arms recently what inspired my comment was this video from uDjHammersTrains. It shows an RA consist assigned to the  train waiting at Atlantic Avenue I presume on its way to Coney Island for heavy maintenance. You can see at  there is no BDivision car on the head end and at  that there is none on the rear. Since the only way on and off the Flushing Line is over the B Division it seems like this cant be all that unusual an occurrence. ,nycrail,dc7d8m3,4,t5_33me2
