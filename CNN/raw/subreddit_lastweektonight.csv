IMO the author that was chosen for John Oliver should have been someone with a better and more developed connection like Jon Stewart or Stephen Colbert who see Oliver as a new ground in comedy. I agree with what you are saying and it really should be more about John Oliver but its more of being included on the list is the significance. ,lastweektonight,cqhfwga,1,t5_31f71

I fucking love taxes and think they should be higher in most cases.The reason we dont tax churches is because they provide a public good. And it doesnt just have to be volunteering the ability to unite a community as provide people with a service they enjoy is often a good in and of itself. Churches for the most part are nonprofit institutions. When some lose that goal Im fine with taxing them. But the actual effect that only that portion of churches would have is not noticeable in the grand scheme of taxation policy.gtAs we heard John say there are over  churches in this country. Compare that to around  public schools and I would consider that a huge issue in itself.Im not really sure what point youre making here. How are they related?

Super tiny but incredibly densely populated.I am an American and I will be getting my first passport stamp outside of Canada next year.  As a kid we mostly vacationed throughout the US because the landscapes are incredibly diverse throughout our country and my parents could never justify a plane ticket across the ocean for our entire family despite being upper middle class.  They found other expenses like our college savings more important.  My SO and I are saving up so we can go on a European honeymoon and the plane ticket is the most expensive part.  s  We are thinking of having a  hour layover in Iceland just to make it less expensive and I really want to go there.

Bad grammar is no joke!If you could kindly take a moment to pull your head out of your antifeminist ass you might be able to appreciate the difference between normal American women and powerhungry South American strongmen. Im sure that even you could see that one of the most important purposes of comedy going back to Jonathan Swift and Voltaire is to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable so to speak. I doubt that many women who have been harassed and stalked online to the point where they genuinely feared for their lives have never run their native country like a budding dictatorship.And whats the point of asking a question like this if you have no interest in genuine discussion? Its so needlessly negative! Never underestimate the power of a positive attitude kiddo.

It was dropped on France for the resistance to pick up... it had worse firing rate single shot that reportedly took longer to load than to manufacture it Basically no accuracy after I think  yards and I think the only thing that it did well was not cost a lot. The whole thing is exactly like what you are describing so we can all just be issued our liberators right? eh not really people actually working in Resistance and guerrilla tactics had no use for that because it was too far behind like sending a knight with a dagger to slay a dragon. Now if we want to talk about limiting who gets guns because they start out able but then do certain things that violate the trust we have for them to do the right thing that could be an interesting conversation and I invite anyone to have that conversation. ,lastweektonight,cvo2xmk,2,t5_31f71

It could be a housemate being a dick. Or it could be a conspiracy by the government to change a single voters party affiliation.You cant just cry fraud every time you lose.Bernie Sanders is restoring my faith in the establishment by proving how empty all this antiestablishment rhetoric is. From the beginning hes been using easily believed but easily debunked lies about the establishment such as that the debates were rigged against him to deligitimize and demonize the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton. But the debates were not rigged against him. The DNC scheduled the same six debates they always schedule before any candidates declared. Heres the DNCs press release from . Six debates. And Heres a debate schedule from . Six DNCsanctioned debates And as always more debates were scheduled by the candidates. The debates werent hidden. All the big three broadcast network debates for both Democrats and Republicans were scheduled by the networks on the weekend because networks dont put politics in primetime anymore. The networks hardly ever allow primetime presidential addresses anymore either. But the reason why it seemed like Democratic debates were on the weekend while Republican debates were on weeknights is because Democrats scheduled their broadcast debates earlier when they would have been more useful to upstart challengers like Sanders while Republicans kept their debates on cable until after the first states had already voted. So people were comparing apples to oranges weekend broadcast debates to weeknight cable debates when all broadcast debates were on weekends for both parties.Oh and Republicans cancelled one of their broadcast debates while Democrats actually got a Sunday night debate the mostwatched night of the week.,lastweektonight,d2cntu6,14,t5_31f71

They shouldnt be the ones to draw conclusions on a political issue like that just present data. How much research could there possibly be on the subject anyway? Guns are guns whats there to figure out? It sounds like a waste of money when they should be researching diseases considering thats their job.
