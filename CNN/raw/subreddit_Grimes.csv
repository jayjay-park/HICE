3238429,0,t3_2x5m8p,The instrumentation is really nice to listen but the voices totally ruined the cover i think. sounded like a really hard range for these guys to sing comfortably in.but that guitar work was really nice. did enjoy,Grimes,coxo4qc,2,t5_2ujxx

5375659,0,t1_cvyrja5,Huh Ive never seen any live recording of Infinite  anywhere and believe me Ive looked pretty much everything up. Would be interesting to hear since most of her live versions are just as dope as the album ones some even better.,Grimes,cvysuwr,4,t5_2ujxx
5487848,0,t3_3q84fg,And lemme just remind everyone how stunning it is that she wrote performed and produced the entire thing and every other song on the album by herself. That she birthed this song in its entirety without any outside help is insane. Very few artists can be completely selfmade and still be so consistent in their output as Grimes has been.,Grimes,cwd4fvq,10,t5_2ujxx

5592489,0,t3_3rpzgt,Maybe Kill V. Maim or Art Angels? They are both very close to the length of Evangelion but its also very likely that the song didnt make the album theres supposed to be a ton of songs not on the album.,Grimes,cwqau74,3,t5_2ujxx
5593292,0,t3_3rqazz,They both werent produced SOLELY by grimes so they were never considered to be on Art Angels,Grimes,cwqef8c,7,t5_2ujxx
5599306,0,t1_cwr3cje,Totally agree. Production is always something I tend to pay attention to but this experience has cause me to have a new found respect for it. I almost feel bad I couldnt wait. I feel like if I ever told her I listened to her precious album at such a shit quality itd be like I slapped her in the face. I actually probably would tell her though just to highlight how good of a producer I think she is. Would be worth the heat.,Grimes,cwr5b5j,0,t5_2ujxx

5645204,0,t3_3sbu3e,In regard to Be a Body ..Its my favorite song on the album its my favorite song to play... Laughs Its really stupid because I dont want to seem like some Asiaphile. Im so embarrassed about that but its the Japanese characters for wabisabi which is a concept that implies or is about nonattachment and not being too attached to physical stuff. The song is kind of about being in the moment. Its about experiencing the physical world right now and not being attached to things.,Grimes,cwwubnm,1,t5_2ujxx

6537471,0,t1_czvio0r,Glad you remembered every little bit of my music taste and are stalking my personal comments. I can have an opinion on music ya know. Also pointing out the fact that Lana fans are rude might be dissing them but it doesnt mean it isnt true. Not all of them but from our experience a good chunk of them. Not finding the appeal in her music  dissing the music? Ok now im dissing it. Its boring AF and her voice sucks. Her dad had to finance her multiple times to get her career off. As fake as it getsNews flash! I dont like every genre or musician ever doesnt mean im dissing it! I dont like much rap. I dont like much country. I dont like  of metal or rock. Im a musician myself but my lifes not  devoted to music and studying ever genre and subgenre out there. I never even made a comment on the arbitus thread. If youd like to collect my opinion into your weird stalker file on me then I actually dont think they should be selling them without compensating her. ,Grimes,czvizs5,1,t5_2ujxx

8515283,0,t3_4w7u68,Lyrics sites are always wrong on lots of words. To avoid this an artist should always post the actual lyrics of their own songs online or have it printed with the album. But IMHO to have people discuss and argue about the songs is a good thing. A little controversy and mystery is rarely bad.,Grimes,d65ywir,7,t5_2ujxx

10244139,0,t3_5mofuf,I think she will continue to add sounds to her palette that are a mixture of classics the y drum sounds on Visions for example which I suspect came from her Juno and the synths and unique stuff thats just the product of someone using industry standard tools in a novel way. I dont think shes much concerned with her critics at this point. It seems that she just wants to make music that shes proud of and which showcases her talents as a producer. I thought Medieval Warfare was interesting bc it relied on a lot more mainstream soundsproduction primarily the drums but it still had some very Grimey touches explosions weird samples and that lofi numetal sounding guitar riff plus the vocals obviously. I imagine her next album will be fairly similar in approach processwise to AA but its pretty hard to predict what it will sound like.,Grimes,dc58alq,3,t5_2ujxx
