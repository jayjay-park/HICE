1749675,0,t3_2eghzt,I am open to it. Maybe we could do a trial for a season and see what people think and if they hate it we go back to WedSat. If you were going to miss the next war you know to pop out as soon as you finish your attacks in the current war. The times would automatically change by a little bit later each time if we wait an hour in between wars so scheduling is easy and there would be way more loot to win. The downside is that only a few people can and do donate to the war castles which gets expensive and the top folks always spend a bunch making dragons pekkas hogs or whatever for the attacks. I think we can handle it if we relax our standards a bit since we usually win by a ton however. ,ClashAbsinthe,cjzpeoi,1,t5_3281e
