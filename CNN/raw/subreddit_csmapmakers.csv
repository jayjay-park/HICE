It wont fix it. You need to load pointfile and see where the red line goes and fix the leak. If you delete that only another entity will leak instead.

3169170,0,t1_coq800s,Good question. I suppose that depends on the partners skills and their own desires. Like I stated I wanted to get back to Hammering but wouldnt expect my partners to do all the modelling and texturing.I suppose it would be approached more like a design studio might and everybody would do environment art and build the level. Just have to keep a good foundation for the art style which is already set by CounterStrike and of course a system that makes sure were not working on the same files at the same time.,csmapmakers,coqheed,1,t5_2yq3c

3546209,0,t1_cpq2ser,Is that thin red slice above the yellow block intentional? Or do you suggest the yellow corridor opens into the room directly north of it which leads off mid? I also dont see how this would put more pressure on the CT at mid?With a good spawn the Ts can get across mid before CT see similar to Dust and Inferno. The smoke isnt always necessary and with quite an open skybox theres nothing stopping a more advanced smoke further into mid to allow Ts a sneaky entry as well slight tangent.This image shows the current battlefrontsRegarding the long B route the crate sounds like a nice idea for gameplay. I didnt want to push the contact point round towards B as I think CTs need a chance to play aggressively and that area allows is perfectly.

6599706,0,t1_d00xa14,No hammer doesnt work with the model format at all except for rendering them. If you want to export an existing model you will need two thingsFirstly you will need Crowbar which decompiles models into their basic format text docs and then you will need a D editing program such a Maya Max or Blender. None of these programs work with the Source decompiled model format directly in all cases you will need a rd party plugin which can read the .smd format.With dsMax you have a rd party script plugin called WallWormModelTools this will allow you to import the decompiled models into dsMax as well as importing all of the models properties a model is far more complex than just a polygon mesh for rexport into Source again.I have never used Blender so I cannot really comment. However I highly suggest that you get involved in the Autodesk Education program. Whereas Blender is just one piece of software getting access to Autodesk software will give you access to many of the most popular and powerful bits of Software used in the industry today. dsMax Maya Mudbox CAD and many others. Of all those I recommend Max simply because of WallWorm. In constant development for over  years WallWorm offers without a doubt more tools than any other rd party Source software dedicated to Source. The great thing is that not only does WallWorm massively simply handling Sources stupidly complex model system but also allows you to use dsMax as a full level editor for Source to the point where you can forget Hammer altogether. This means you can build mapslevel directly in Max you can make your models in situe in your map side by side with your world geometry which is something none of Valves native SDK tools are capable of doing.But it does depend on how far you want to go with this dsMax is a very powerful piece of software compared to Hammer and because of this it does take a little longer to learn. However if you are looking to get further into modeling for Source then in the long run it will save you far more time than working with anything else.Good Luck!,csmapmakers,d01yozx,1,t5_2yq3c

Visclusters have no function in game and are only there to help reduce compile times.As someone said use clip brushes and make them go up the stairs so they touch the leading edge of every stair that keeps them smooth... just remember if your stairs are spiral it is very hard to make sloping brushes on axis that are not true northsouth or westeast.,csmapmakers,d03czh1,1,t5_2yq3c

7426763,0,t3_4h0e0k,Since I cant really playtest the map in v these suggestions come from a mapper and SupremeGlobal in game. A site problemsSuper low skybox. Super annoying. In the A halls hotel area there is a drop down to some chairs. You cant reach them since there is a ClipBrush here. Make it more cut of so people dont try to get there. I also think that the Ts reach the site too early. Cts can barely smoke up and take positions before Ts get to site. The mid can be SUPERabused as a T to get to the A site. Just throw one smoke and some flashes and you get a free plant on A. To to T sided site. B site problemsThe huge statuething in the middle is crazy. Imagen in an after plant situation where the T just needs to avoid the CT the T can just run around the statue and listen for sounds.The plantpositions is very limited witch is super boring.  The site is too small in my opinion. The only good positions as a CT to play is behind the statue. And the small CT connecter. Boring site. Mid problemsIt is very easy for Ts to take mid control.The mid to A connecter is very easy for Ts to get to. I see no real reason to split B since the B site is ez to take as it is since the B site offers to tunnels to the site. Example Dust B site only offers the Ts one tunnel PLUS the CTs got waaaay more positions to take.  OverallSome stairs look not proportionate to the characters. Example is in T mid where they are both too large and to small. B site as well.Maybe lower the ambient sound a bit. It bugs meWoodstack in CT spawnmid is not jumpable. Think of it like this Should you be able to jump this? If the answer is yes Make it jumpable!!!!!!!! So annoying to go up to something and then you cant get there because of an invisible wall. If you need to block players from getting there just make other changes like bars etc. Glitchy texture in Tmid by the tree inside fence.The overall feel of the map is that it is no unison in theme. The foliage is both pinelike and leaftrees. No problem about that but then you mix in tropical plants as well. And then it is other props. Like a train station at the same location as an old church and some roman arches in midtown by a road and industries? Light in the skybox is messed up. You have one sun in the skybox and one envsun on a different location. Why is there a water texture under the map?! skybox?Remove clip brush on the woodpile in Mid by A. Remove clip brush on the fence in T mid or make it thinner. The tree between A apps and T spawn looks super fake. Possible map layout fixesMove the MidA connecter towards ct spawn. I would suggest by the mid lamppole. Block of one of the B tunnels from T spawn. I would say block the right one of t perspective and make it possible for Ts to get it from Mid. Move Ct spawn forward to make the Cts reach their destination at least one second earlier. ,csmapmakers,d2mdim0,3,t5_2yq3c

7994833,0,t3_4oprxm,Sup!You saw the other comment so I assume you understand the format.Here is the imgur I start with more gameplay stuff then I show some visual stuff that needs to be fixed. I like that this entrance is from mid now not a default way into A site however I still think it is too close to the mid entrance. It is really easy to take as a T. As an example in P you can just drop a smoke on the corner and run through your smoke and they will never spot you. The bot is dead there btw thats why you see itAlso the fire is confusing getting hit by it caused me to reel a bit trying to figure out why i got hit. I would remove it for gameplay. The box doesnt really serve  any purpose for gameplay. If you think cover should be here add a tallerbigger box otherwise i would get rid of it to avoid getting stuck on it in a gunfight. The entrance to B from mid i think is too far i think removing the fence and pipes would fix it. Not something you have to change if you like it that way its just my view on it. This spot is so dumb xD. You have to go SO far as a T to clear that angle. Also the ladder brush either got deleted by accident or it might be inside the model. Either way you cant climb the ladder currently. Picture is hard to make out sorry about that. What im addressing here is the clip brush for the pipe is way to big and by jumping you get stuck on the brush. It needs to be shrunk a bit so you dont get stopped by it when jumping. You cant jump out here but it really looks like you can. Thats fine that you cant jump out but dont make it look like you can jump on it but cant. It is very confusing. Visual stuff that I dont want you to forget. You have a lot of floating props and holes in your map like this. These arent the only examples but they are really obvious too find them all. You placed a decal on the outside but because you used a decal it spread to the inside. Im assuming this is unintentional especially since it wont show you that in the editor. Just change the decal to a infooverlay. I understand the stairs are just a noclip right now. I am actually talking about the height of each step. They are definitely way too tall and look weird. Architects dont usually design structures with windows that are just blocked off.

8588706,0,t1_d6f3juz,Its not likely just one tiny block causing the waterindices to be that full. The engine is having to merge a whole lot of brushes. I just noticed this in your OPgti just did a fast render thats it and i cant do a Full HDR compile that takes to long i was compling for  hours and it still was not done!Unfortunately you have to do a full HDR compile. CSGO doesnt support anything else. This is likely causing the lighting problem. If it wasnt causing problems before your map probably just got to a point in development where it was too complex for fast render at all and vrad noped out.One trick to cut down on vrad compile time during developing is to select the whole map and set the lightmap grid for all textures to . Your shadows will look awful but compile times go way down. Then when youre in the homestretch for release you can go back and lower the lightmaps and fine tune all of that.But with waterindices being that high Im thinking that could be the main reason for the long compile times.,csmapmakers,d6f6e2l,1,t5_2yq3c

8661173,0,t3_4yj18v,Basically just any image editing program that has layers.The way I make my overlays is manually deleting parts of the image sometimes I also use the Magic tool in Photoshop for it. Than I apply stroke layer style that basically adds px of solid white to the border of my image.Removing the ceiling   When you fly in the sky with noclip to get in the middle of the map and you have a complete overview of your map with clleveloverview x then do clleveloverview  and look DIRECTLY down. Now put on the clleveloverview x again with the same scale as before.Now press FORWARD and youll essentially move lower in your map at one point things will begin to disappear. Aka the more lower you go some parts of the ceiling will disappear.Depending on how much your map difference in altitude youll have to take multiple screenshots and stitch them together in example Photoshop. Take caution here that you dont want your X Y or scale value to be different than when going lower or higher in the map or youll have a hard time stitching together these images.The rest is really personal preference if you want to have these grid lines in the background or if you want to have the nonplayable parts of your map on like  opacity.,csmapmakers,d6o9i9p,2,t5_2yq3c

9625899,0,t3_5cq7jk,Havent looked at it ingame but here are my  cents. I dont think the map is a Maze. You have  entrances into mid per team which is totally OK on my end. Once you get used to the layout this should be a problem. Which makes it look a little mazy is the fact that its lanes arent visible at first glance which is no problem at all. . Without look at it ingame Asite has  problems. It only has  entrances minimum of any site should be  and the timings could be a bit off. looks like CTs could be a bit late for the party.. you have a lot of  angles you should try to make some other angle. layout looks very blocky an .ish atm.. your main mid corridor looks a bit flat  play with some height elevations here an there.. looks like you could have some really long sightlines hard to judge  from just looking at the layout  keep on working!

Every file separately added into the game. This is not used in csgo except for vslve maps. In tf some community maps are added using this method.
