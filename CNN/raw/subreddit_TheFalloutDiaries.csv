64706,0,t1_cels9ig,I dont think Ive seen it.  Well like I said it depends on what kind of role you want.  Out in the wild heres what the various types end up as   Mondays  Sex Slaves housekeepers childcare workers.  Mostly female Tuesdays  Any Monday type job Farm workers heavy lifting basic unskilled labor  mostly male some female   Wednesdays  Any Monday or Tuesday type job Mechanics construction jobs bluecollar skills  mostly male some female   Thursdays  Anything they want.  Obvious options include Mercenaries guards security work.   Fridays  Anything they want but are more suited toward being scientists doctors librarians accountants.  Their personalities vary but the first three tend to be cheerful and affable.  They like to work.  They like someone being in charge and they like having a regular set of duties and responsibilities.  Remember theyre fully synthetic but also fully functional in the carnal sense.  The latter two vary depending on their situation.  Theyre organic and that means they sometimes shake off programmed personalities.  Note that the only way I can justify a Thursdaygeneration being out and about given my headcanon is in the following situations   Renegade Synth Retention Bureau Like Hal Harkness yawn   Valkyrie unit stolen from the Commonwealth within the past  years   Lone survivor of Commonwealthorigin trade expedition with reset memories.  ,TheFalloutDiaries,celsou8,2,t5_2umbl
