1363186,0,t3_29pbkv,Id also like to say that ujonsfalsereality is a great trader! We had a bit of a scare because FedEx claimed to have delivered the box on Saturday but it never showed up.  When he got in contact with me to check on package arrival we started working with FedEx and they didnt think they were going to find the box so we started filling out a claim.He was all ready to ship out another box and was working on putting it together when this beauty arrived today! So I just wanted to let everyone know about how cool he was about the situation and that you shouldnt hesitate to trade with him.,beeritforward,cin5xyc,3,t5_2zf5d

2124275,0,t3_2jaadf,Killer box!  So excited to try these!  And badass maple candy and maple syrup to go with awesome beers!  This is especially awesome since someone was recently telling me how Lawsons maple triple tastes like maple candy and it really made me in the mood for maple sweets.  I walked down to a candy store by my office to look for maple candies but they were closed.  I bought some anchor autumn maple beers but it wasnt enough maple.  I finally went to a bakery for a maple bacon truffle but still wasnt enough maple.  I took a pull off of my bottle of bourbon barrel aged maple syrup but it just didnt cut it.  I even went out for pancakes and paid extra for the good maple syrup but it wasnt the maple candy rush I needed.  Now ubordsox come through like an angel from Vermont with little maple candies shaped like maple leaves and awesome beers too!  Thanks for the killer awesome sweet ass tits of a box!  Im getting into that mastermind right now!,beeritforward,cl9ubeb,1,t5_2zf5d
