The article mentions Daltanization which is a bit controversial because it modifies the majoritys perception of something in favor of a very small minoritys. In Tribes Ascend I imagine itd be difficult to snipe with colorblindness. Theres no way around this and its accepted that you should probably do something else. It sounds incredibly rude but aside from customization of colors on a userbyuser basis nothing should be done because colorblind gamers are a very small minority. Accessibility is important but at some point youre going to impede on the end users ability to play. If done the Daltonization way at least.Im all for customization though I think its important for games like this to be completely controllable in most if not all aspects. ,Supraball,chg5aar,-9,t5_31krw

1124373,0,t3_26zfhd,Im a proponent of bumping the man you are marking.  Near the sides it puts you as a defender in a better position to intercept.  In the middle it can buy your team time to boost back to defense a good attacker can use this bump to get open though but if done in the right area the defender should have time to recover.  In front of the penalty box bumping attackers away puts more distance between them and your goal making shotsvolley easier for your keeper to save.  Now if you are up against a defender just focused on making your life hell then he is disregarding his duty to protect his goal.  Simply back out and your other forwards will slip in behind him.  This is a team game and this defenders teamplay is shit hes going to lose a lot of games against decent teams.  Until matchmaking is introduced your best bet of learning teamplay and playing as a team is to join a tournament or join pickup games.  Honestly public server play is awful.  There is no teamwork.  If you are going to play in a public server I suggest exclusively playing defense.  You will learn a lot about positioning and tendencies of players.  You will learn the mechanics well enough.  You will probably win a lot too since pub players rarely defend.,Supraball,chw3n2e,2,t5_31krw

4725322,0,t1_ctpx45o,I think yours is the right approach for decreasing box camping.Why do defenders camp the box?  Because currently they have more impact there than at  field or  field.  In order to decrease the box camp you either have to increase the impact a defender has away from the box or decrease his impact innear the box.Why would a defender backtrack on the ball carrier?  Because he can go off the side wall and get a boost.  This is minor because the defender still has a large advantage over the ball carrier and should be aggressive on him as long as he stays in position not to be beat by a side wall self boost.Were going to have to look at the other  pair of attackers and defenders.My thoughts as a defenderSucker  The sucker is a bitch especially if you have a higher ping than the attacker.  If theres an attacker coming that I know will try to sucker me I mark him out of sucker range and backtrack all the way to the box.  I can kick him as he enters my range but why should I?  I am probably walking backwards making my kick weaker.  If I walk towards him and kick then I risk not exiting his sucker.  I believe the current suckerkick balance makes the smart defensive choice to camp the box especially for a higher ping player.Increasing Kick Strength  An increase in kick strength addresses the trepidation of the defender in my above scenario.  With a stronger kick the defender worries less about a kick not being strong enough to overpower the sucker.  He becomes more aggressive thus venturing further from the box.  So the defender is further from the box now but his stronger kick means its harder for an attacker to get around him he cant get upfield easily on his own.  This leaves space behind the defender.  The attackers boosts are stronger so its possible for attackers to boost a guy into this space behind the defender.There are other balancing considerations to be made concerning boosting but I think stronger player to player kicks would have a positive impact on gameplay.Decreasing Box SizeDecreasing the size of the box simply lets attackers get in closer.  If the suckerkick is not changed the gameplay will be the same except that attackers can shoot from closer and die less.  Defenders will continue to camp and may actually just stack the goal line since they are going to be a few steps closer to the goal.,Supraball,ctq60kc,2,t5_31krw
