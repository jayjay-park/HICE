1635315,0,t1_cj52pq7,Im sorry but you must not drive around much if you actually think that.  That bridge is probably the most busiest and most traffic heavy bridges out there and there is definitely no way closing a lane would be logical just to give bike commuters a convenient solution.  While the construction goes on I suggest people practice common sense and patience... a  minute crossing even on the m open side is going to last about a year maybe and in about a year and a half if I remember correctly about the bridge expansion plan both sides will have plenty of space for biking.I feel like I have to put in a disclaimer too that I bike about kyear  and cross that bridge a LOT but I also drive that bridge enough to know half of the time it is jam packed with traffic with the right lanes pretty much dedicated most times to large commercial trucks and buses.  As thehummus actually pointed out Id have gotten the rider across safely but definitely had a word on the other side as a way to help.Edit Sorry for the extremely late reply and I hope this doesnt come off as a rant.  Im just hoping to bridge the gap I find in this city with BikerDriver anger both ways which doesnt need to be there.,vancouvercycling,cjlaoko,1,t5_2usih
3338980,0,t3_2v1cci,Ive always had good experiences at Dream cycles on Commercial drive. It is the one shop I still stop by when I am in town since leaving for the Valley. OCB seems to come and go. I had good experiences and then a couple of years later had some incredibly poor experiences. Ed at Mighty Riders knows his stuff but can be hard to deal with. If you know that going in I found him alright but not a shop I feel super comfortable in.FYI for your next bike purchase. I dont know what sportcheks service plan is but a lot of bike shops will give you a years worth of tuneups on a new bike. Many also operate on the weird bro deal system. I get tax off a my current shop for being a regular something sportchek will never do. Its a weird thing but fairly common and unwritten in bike shops. But Sportcheks bikes are alright and a cut above department store bikes so I am sure you will be happy with your purchase.,vancouvercycling,cp8vadk,1,t5_2usih
