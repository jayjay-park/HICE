101358,0,t3_1v6yig,You said your first competition is coming up? How long have you been riding? Im curious because I rode up until the end of high school was never that great and now cant afford it in college. Im so worried that once I get back to it Ill be too old to progress at all and you look like youre doing great! One of my favorite riding instructors was from Denmark too!,Equestrian,cepyy8h,1,t5_2r4or
101527,0,t1_cepyy8h,It is the first competition of the new season not my first competition all in all  I have been riding since before I can even remember it. I got my first pony in  an did mostly dressage back then. At some point that was too boring and I started jumping. As a youngrider I did  cm  feet  i think that translates to classes at CSI events. Since then jumping also got boring and now I am doing eventing.But dont worry about getting old. Your body will never forget how to follow the movements of the horse. It will take a couple of times on the horse to be fully back. But it will be fast and you will fell comfortable. I took a full year off back in college and was back at the competitions within a month or so after being back in the saddle. I have plenty of friends who like you couldnt afford it through college. They all came back and are doing great. You never get too old for riding. Danish champion in eventing  was  year old Johan Iversen. He is still riding still getting better and still taking lessons. He started out a young horse two years ago and will be competing him in his first international competitions in june. Who was your danish instructor? And where? It really is a tiny country and we kind of know everybody here  ,Equestrian,cepzn6q,1,t5_2r4or

251385,0,t1_cf6lp7g,Im with you on this Ive only ever had experience with large mixed herds  boarders  pastures divided based on which aisle you were in unless your horse had a specific problem with a particular horse and then my last barn where it was individual turnout only. I can no longer afford the individualonly place since their rates went up... so Im where Im at now which is okay though not ideal. I think changing the herds is what made it a problem because as far as I know she had been going out with a  year old gelding and  year old mare for the past month and they are all GREAT together. My mare is extremely food aggressive she was a rescued bag of bones off Craiglist before I got her but they dont feed in the field so I doubt it was targeted aggression.,Equestrian,cf6t6qy,2,t5_2r4or

279594,0,t1_cf9p824,Thank you for the great advice. I am sorry about what happened with your first horse so soon after you got him! I know it must have been heartbreaking and stressful trying to figure out what decision to make but you definitely did the right thing for him. You sound like a great owner and Im glad to see another college student that has been successful and responsible owning their own horse. I will definitely have my new trainer with me throughout the whole process. I forgot to mention that in the post. I wont be contacting any owners or looking at any horses by myself.  Great point on preventative measures. I will do everything I can to keep the horse as healthy as possible. The barn I will board at has its own preferred vet farrier dentist and even masseuse I believe! Honestly I kind of cant wait to start researching all the different supplements feed toys and tack to get to meet my horses needs. It makes it so much more awesome to know that what Im getting is finally for the horse that I own. Based on what happened with your horse I am definitely going to be putting aside money every month just in case of emergencies. Do you have insurance for your horse? I dont know very much about horse insurance definitely something I will really be looking into and asking my trainer about. I am torn about age. There is a horse that is just fantastic already at the barn Im going to board at in perfect health and UTD on everything. But he just turned . Thats a great age right now for me but Im worried because he will be in his twenties by the time Im done with school and starting to make it on my own. That would be the worst time for me to have a senior to financially support even if I loved him to death. ,Equestrian,cf9qqqz,2,t5_2r4or

I also went to my massage therapist a few days later I go every week or two to help with my rheumatoid arthritis and herniated disc already.   I also iced it the first day or so and used heating pads for a few days on the sore spots.

As much as it sucks to sell her you can hopefully take a little comfort in the fact that your decision is going to benefit her as much as you. Stay in contact with her new owners and if it makes you feel better you can always work a clause in the sales contract that if they decide to sell her in the future they have to come to you fist.This is the hardest part of the journey.

The magnets let it function as a sort of tote though that is somewhat awkward and my nippers usually fall off the magnets arent strong enough to hold fullsize nippers. It works for my . flexible pony but just barely haha. I can tell hes not too fond of it though... a quick googling brings up this thing  Cheaper better features and a better sized. Seems reasonable to me LOL.Both of those options are rather expensive but hey I figure since I recouped the cost of it in only  trims it was worth it and it seems like itll go for another  years at least.

They can get moon blindness which is a virus causes pain that can lead to blindness.

Do you insure your house? Your car? Isnt your horse another big money item with the potential for getting you in serious debt if something comes up that you cant pay for without insurance? If you wreck your car without insurance you can buy a junker for a couple hundred bucks to get you by. But your horse suddenly decides to colic and you wind up with fullblown level  vet intervention. Are you gonna tell the vet to put him down? Or go in and do surgery?

I was riding a green pony in a lesson and discovered pretty quickly that he just didnt have the balance and coordination to be jumping. Unfortunately at  I didnt really know how to express that to an instructor.  We were coming through a small line  maybe  and I lost control of him between the jumps. It should have been a pony  stride I thought we were taking it in  but we took it in . He cleared the jump but missed the landing.  He went down on his knees and flipped me into the dirt headfirst. I chipped a piece off of C in my neck and got a nice concussion to go with it.  The instructor had me get up and walk back to the barn so I wouldnt be in the way of the other riders in the class.

1553334,0,t3_2bv9bf,Do some research on the barns in your area and compare costs and maybe talk to some people who ride there to find out if theyre happy with the way things are run. Im in Maryland and there are a couple places in my area that have bad reputations overworked lesson ponies disinterested instructors etc.. First and foremost especially when starting out you want lessons to be a fun and rewarding experience  otherwise theyre not worth spending ANY money on.  As other people have mentioned once a week is pretty much the standard way to start  in my area they run about  for an hour small group lesson. Private generally costs a bit more. My barn actually only does  minute lessons for kids which I think is smart  they can have pretty short attention spans!   Check your local tack shops  many offer beginner packages that include a schooling helmet and boots for a reasonable price. If youre going to invest in some equipment upfront Id recommend a helmet  good riding schools should throw out olddamaged lesson helmets but its hard to be sure.  As far as time investment for the parents  Id plan at least  hours for a  hour lesson. Most places teach the kids how to care for the horses too so theyll need time on either end of the lesson for groomingtacking up and untackingcooling out the horse. And time to give the pony some snuggles of course  ,Equestrian,cjazfhv,0,t5_2r4or

I was on the equestrian team but spent most of my junior year abroadin another state and when I came back for senior year I took on some major schoolcareerrelated responsibilities and just did not have the time to ride even once a week. After graduation I was barely making ends meet on my entrylevel salary couldnt afford to ride and with no horse connections in the area didnt have a lot of options. I eventually ended up volunteering at a therapeutic riding place which was free and a great rewarding experience.I missed it a lot at first but then it just... kinda wasnt part of my life anymore. I was really busy and almost went cold turkey. I didnt read internet sites or stuff about horses I didnt have any friends who were into it... it wasnt something I thought about a whole lot. But when I did I missed it intensely. I think what kept me going is I always knew I would get back into it someday.I started back up a year ago after a six year break and its been great. It is a huge stress reliever for me  this is awful that my brain works like this but its the one time in the day I CANT think about work or the other stuff going on in my life. When Im in the middle of cantering around a course Im only focused on that moment and its incredible.I dont know if the better option is to go cold turkey like I did or hang onto it through weekly lessons or volunteering at a therapy place or something. But youll figure it out  maybe try quitting altogether for a while and see how it goes.

1960401,0,t3_2h4yoz,Unfortunately a horse that will posture at you will escalate. You need to be contacting a professional trainer who is skilled in ground work specifically. If my mare had been accidentally bred I would have had it pinchedhopefully you are in a position to properly care for a mare and foal not suggesting otherwise merely stating as my wish for you. A horse that turns to kick or comes at a human needs an immediate and swift come to Jesus moment. They need to think that they are going to die if they do that again. Jim Woffard has a really good analogy that is essentially Be the wicked witch while disciplining in the momentas in within  seconds of the transgression anything after that is irrelevantthen be Dorothy the rest of the time. Horses are big and dangerous and that kind of behaviour needs to be dealt with immediately. I would also consult the vet and investigate safe hormone treatments that would not interfere with the foal. Some may explain that it is because she is protective now of the foaldoesnt matter...she is never allowed to harm you or another human being.As for your lunging technique there are probably great tutorial videos online. For me I dont crack the whip unless I need to. My horses are used to a great deal of groundwork so I have them calibrated to a whisper rather than a shout. At some point I was taught the basics and then kept practicing reading attending clinics...groundwork is an essential skill that is not necessarily intuitive.

Shes semi retired now and is teaching her owners granddaughter to ride and love horses.

Very easy to sift through and very easy to only get rid of the messes and not the good bedding. Usually theyd start with  or  bags to get a nice depth in a stall and spritz them with water so they loosened up and could be fluffed and then as needed theyd add another bag or two.. and that was maybe once a week.So yeah definitely pellets.Straw is the worst.

2419075,0,t3_2n5eut,Critics usually point to four thingsParellis techniques dont work for every horse and sometimes Pat and Linda are really pushing a horse when they shouldnt just to put on a show and sell their training style. Two pretty cringeworthy video examples of this are  Parelli DVD set Level  DVD  Chapter  where Linda constantly gets in the face of a oneeyed horse who is given no chance to obey and  Pat Parelli doing some pretty harsh stuff to a horse named Catwalk at a live demo.The merchandising of the Parelli method looks greedy. They  push people to buy their  dvd sets books sets fifty dollar carrot sticks and expensive clinic sessions toys rope halters lip balm clothing etc.Theres a stereotype that many devotees of the Parelli method seem to play a lot of games The Seven Games with their horses on the ground but never ever actually ride them. And somehow despite all the groundwork their horses are brats.Some Parelli followers will talk all day about leftbrain vs right brain horses being calmassertive Zones  and  teaching a horse to follow a feel being at suchandsuch a level etc etc and the jargon and air of superiority tends to put other people off.Obviously these stereotypes certainly dont apply to all Parelli methods andor followers!

Every Tredstep product Ive bought on the other hand has broken very quickly breeches shipped with holes on the seat buttons that popped off on the first wear and half chaps that needed the zippers replaced within a couple months.Tipperary helmets are great for those with a more oval head shape and fairly inexpensive. If your head is more round then look into Troxel. If you have a local tack shop it should be pretty easy to figure out which is a better fit for you.Id definitely recommend half chaps and riding breeches or tights as well.

2521801,0,t3_2oiojl,Obviously I dont know you or your horse and as someone said internet strangers cant give tailored avdive. However from what I can seeThe trot you had between the first and second jumps? That trot had more impulsion than you started with. Starting with and maintaining impulsion means their hind end is engaged in the motion theyre less likely to trip or balk more likely to tuck their front feet and round up over the jump especially at higher heights. For me this almost always meant across the board though all the maybe  horses Ive ridden were at one barn more inside support through the turn a little opening inside rein but at very least some pressure with the inside leg through the three points into during out of of the the turn. This is something to get a feel for on the flats first. I couldnt see much of your handarm but another thing to be mindful of is your inside shoulder through the turn. Try when you look wait and turn to pick your inside shoulder up and back a little. It opens their inside shoulder up picks it up through the turn distributes weight across their back and down your inside leg better and makes for a more organized turn. It seems your horse knows their job and is super honest so Id say these would be great steps to firm up your flatwork in courses and provide more balance impulsion and better horse form. Learning what it all feels like on a horse whos got it and that you trust makes it a lot easier.  A few other notes nice and straight on the lines! Keeping over the center of the jump also helps planorganize turns. Also nice to see the horse not trip through the downward transition from cantertrot. Suggests good leg contact.  Hope that helps!  ,Equestrian,cmnqjlu,7,t5_2r4or

I will be working under a coach but wont be able to start taking lessons off of her until about April or May.Probably beginner novice jumps are up to  and dressage is pretty basic at this level.gtHow do you go about going through a cross country course and remember all of it? Where Ill be showing at they do have the option of schooling xcountry the day before.Definitely get out and school xc as much as you can ahead of time. As far as learning the course they should offer a course walk and possibly a map as well. The jumps are all color and number coded with little signs on the side. The course walk is really helpful because you can walk exactly what lines you plan on riding. At my last event I walked the course three times!gtWhat kind of vests do you guys suggest? Is it okay to buy one online?I like the tipperary vests like this but there are others out there. Buying online is fine just check the measurement chart. The vest should go down your back far enough to protect your tail bone.gtWhat do you do after you finish your course?Go through the finish line! Seriously Ive seen people miss this before so look and see where the finish line is before you ride your course both SJ and XC!. After your final phase cool your horse out untack and wait for scores to be posted.gtWhat are some tips for getting as close to the optimum time as possible? What kind of a watch do I need?Im not a high enough level eventer that I bother about watchesoptimum time to be honest. I just enjoy myself out on course. gtWhat are some types of fences I can make that would imitate xcountry fences but using regular jump standards?If you can get a board or sheet and drapelean it against poles you can probably make a coop or ramp ish looking jump. Stacking hay bales works too. Ive gotten pretty creative with stuff thats just laying around. Just be safe with whatever you find. Honestly though nothing is the same as actually going xc schooling so try to get out and school if you can.gtWould it be okay to wear a navy hunter coat for dressage and use a close contact saddle? I dont know anyone who has a spare dressage saddle and dont have the money to blow it on something Im not  sure of.As far as clothing goes most people will probably go formal for dressage black coat white shirt stock tie white pants black boots. Technically though especially if youre doing a lower level unrecognized event informal is ok blue coat white shirt with ratcatcher tan pants.The saddle is more the iffy part. Most people will use a dressage saddle for dressage because it puts your leg and seat in a better position. A few people use all purpose saddles. If you absolutely cant findborrow a dressage or all purpose its probably not a big deal to use the close contact but not desirable. gtAt what levels is it okay to use a double bridle in?I would have to check the rule book to know for sure but definitely not at the level you would be starting at. Just use a plain snaffle and youll be fine. gtIs there a different dressage pattern for every show Ill go to?There are different dressage tests for different levels. They change every few years. If you are eventing at the same level multiple times this year you should only have to learn one test.gtAre dressage only shows and eventing dressage judged the same way and are the patterns the same? Ive heard theyre judged completely different.They should be judged the same. The horses and riders you see at events are gonna be different than the horses and riders you see at dressage shows so the performance may vary but the judging should remain the same. You might be thinking of the scoring though. Dressage only shows are scored as higherbetter. For eventing since you want as few points as possible they do some math and flip the scores around so a lower number is better.gtAre the showjumping rounds run as one round or are the fastest and clear times brought back to run a final course?You just get one round. If its a real informal event they may not even time you at all. Sometimes in this case dressage score collective marks are sometimes used as a tiebreaker if necessary.,Equestrian,cnv7k6u,1,t5_2r4or

You might want to trainer shop a bit. Even with boatloads of natural talent you are far too green to be riding green horses. And until your leg is still WTC and small fences without stirrups loose the spurs. There is a reason the saying is earn your spurs and you havent yet. Thats not to say you are terrible far from it. Youve got a nice quiet seat and good balance for your riding age.

Do you have any particular questions?Both trips were a lot of fun and nothing at all like the nosetotail beach rides you sometimes take on a nonhorsey vacation.  Id make sure that youre honest about your riding ability and round down rather than up since youll enjoy your trip less if youre battling a mismatched horse.  On both trips I took I adored the horses I was assigned and was really impressed with their quality manners and condition.Be honest with yourself about your riding fitness and fitness in general.  An  hour day in the saddle is a blast but also exhausting.  My Ireland trip had us riding  hours per day and I was beat at the end of the day but was having a ton of fun.  At home I would say I had been probably riding  horse a day  days per week with no nonhorsey exercise.When I did my Iceland trip we did two days of  hours of riding and at home I had been riding only once per week and working out at the gym maybe  days per week.  My fitness level was totally sufficient for that.I think riding vacations are incredibly fun and I have every intention of going on one every few years or so.  Ive always gone with a riding friend of similar ability to mine and felt that that enhanced the experience but you make friends quickly on these trips since everyone shares a common interest.

The jury is still out on whether or not they really are beneficial for flatwork and there isnt one organization that tests the claims made by boot manufacturers. One study even showed that any protection from boots is negated due to overheating the leg. That being said you really need to know your horse. Does he overreach frequently? If so then always using boots is a good idea. Was this a freak accident? Then you may be better off just letting him go without boots. There isnt a best boot its weighing the cons against the pros and seeing which option is a better fit for your horse.

You really have to glue yourself to the saddle by learning how to sit deep while moving with your horses motion. Honestly the best way I developed the strength and sensitivity to have a good deep seat was to ride without stirrups. I know its not often everyones favorite thing to do but believe me you will develop such a strong seat and such good balance. And just take it little bits at a time. I started off just trying to get three laps each direction at each gate. No need to try and do a whole lesson without stirrups right off the bat. But the more you do it the better your seat will be.

There are holes in his training or in yours as a rider and hes not compensating for them like a more tolerant or a better schooled horse would. I say this not to be a jerk but to be honest because I was in your exact same position a few years ago with my horse. All he wanted to do was rush brace be quick could not quiet down blew through my aids what I thought were good aids at the time. Now he had some physical problems that caused this also but it was mostly him being an anxious and worrisome young OTTB and me lacking the proper training in my riding education to ride him correctly and effectively. I got him in shape with a lot of hill work I got him healthy with an excellent diet and I got myself better with getting back into lessons after almost a decade of not taking them. Things to not do that I used to do and you probably do now dont lean dont brace on his mouth with your hands dont post to keep up with his trot. Things to do that I didnt do before but do now half halts are your friend sit back if it feels too far back then its just right YOU control his pace with your posting. Hold him with your legs and your core not your hands. Horses like him are anxious and worry and if they feel blocked by your hands theyre bound for a melt down. They need to feel like they have somewhere to go so give him somewhere to go with your hands add leg and put him to work. My horse would settle better if I gave him a gentle bear hug with both legs. Not squeezingbumping just having them there as a constant. Also there is only so much we can do via the internet.

Especially in the first days my horse was so excited about everything that it was about making sure he doesnt forget his basic manners when being lead groomed etc. Re other stuff for first days and some already before first days some of it Germanyspecific since I know you are from Germany  Certificate of health and isolation  along with the PPE get a certificate of health Gesundheitszeugnis by the vet. It might be asked by your boarding stable as a requirement anyway. Also it will further that your liability insurance PferdeHaftpflichtversicherung has to cover the worst case if your horse brings in a disease and other horses in the stable have to be treatedput down. Else they might consider it reckless behaviour to just bring in an unknown horse and refuse coverage. I second the isolation period I turned mine out separately for  days then he was allowed to join the herd.  Vaccinations  ideally before the PPE look into the equine passport and make sure vaccinations are up to date and whether additional ones are required in your area e.g. for rabies which might have to be preordered. If they need to be refreshed already do it along with the PPE or at the old stable. Then it is still being done in the horses old environment and you dont have the stress on the immune system together with the general stress in the new stable. Again your boarding stable or transport company might require vaccinations to be uptodate. Also sellers often only do the minimum with a horse after a successful sale for fear that it hurts itself. Since you need to go easy on a horse after vaccinating that actually fits quite nicely.     Liability insurance  the horse related liability insurance offers coverage from the moment you apply ! even though it takes time until your application is reviewed and you get proper documentation. Upon application you might want to ask them for a preliminary certificate that states that you are covered from date X and give a copy to your boarding stable along with the health certificate and a copy of the equine passport. So if you borrow a friends trailer to get the horse in the first days and the horse beats it to shreds it is already covered in the first days even if you dont have proper documentation yet.  Surgery insurance  if you opt for surgery insurance a holistic health insurance rarely makes sense in Germany and there are only a few one carrier? that offer them apply for coverage asap i.e. the day you officially own the horse or apply before with coverage becoming effective to the date your contract becomes effective because surgery insurance has a waiting period until it becomes effective at Uelzener the market leader  days for colicrelated operations for bone chip removal  year for everything else  months.   Transition of feed  ask the previous owner what kind and quantity of feed the horse currently is fed get a sample and discuss with your new barn manager how to best transition it to the new feed. If you have a longer transport take feed from the previous stable and stick to its feeding schedule and feed some but little along with water obviously. When horses are used to a feeding schedule they start building saliva ahead of feeding and only swallowing the saliva contributes to collicking in stress situations.  Riding  your horse might not have been worked as much by his previous owner in the last days before you pick it up. Dont hop on straight away maybe only lunge it the first day and see how it goes. Lead it around the arena etc. if it doesnt have a lot of experience with new environments e.g. already competed. I decided to only stick to one rider in the first days so that my horse doesnt have even more to get used to. I wanted to ride myself and only let the professional rider on after two weeks. But be prepared that your horse might behave very differently from tryout in the first days for excess energy and its new environment.  Farrier and saddle check  we pulled my horses shoes for PPE and transport. Since his feet are really poor I had the farrier come out already on day  to put shoes back on. The excited stomping and scraping his feet would else soon have wrecked havoc on his feet. If you keep the previous owners saddle get its fit checked at some point doesnt need to be day  but maybe within the first few weeks once you ride your horse normally again and not everything is new anymore.    Registration  you will have to send the equine passport to the national equine association FN for change of ownership. Send the original together with a copy of the certificate of ownership along with the required form by registered mail!. If you would like to change your horses name or register it for competing do it at the same time as administration costs are then lower. ,Equestrian,d1up308,4,t5_2r4or

8844573,0,t3_51bxhl,I have a hard limit of  per horse per incident.  That means I will never do a colic surgery or big ligament repair but I can afford imaging splint bone surgery three days of supportive in hospital care for moderately severe colic that doesnt need surgery etc.  I love my horses but I know that the rehab that goes with the huge emergency expenses isnt realistic for me.  I  am better off retiring them unsound or euthanizing.   I have helped rehab just about everything for my clients so I have a very good idea of what it takes to say return to competition soundness after colic surgery.I have six horses max at any time and try to have k in savings plus k in credit I hope to never touch.  I have five acres of babysenior pasture so retirement is an affordable option for me.  I also never spend more than k to purchase a horse and most of mine were under k because I do a lot of rescuerehabretraining work.Insurance is great if you have very expensive horses andor you would want to spend k to save your horse in an emergency.  My special cat has health insurance and he racked up  in vet bills that were covered in full.  I love that cat too fucking much.  Theres just no way I would have put a horse through three surgeries  days in the ccu radiation over two months with a feeding tube etc but I never hesitated to do it for this cat.

10259438,0,t3_5mvsg1,A friend of mine had Strategy analyzed when her GP mare started having seizures and they found trace mercury and a ridiculously poorly balanced amino acid profile in it. Which is shocking for a higher end feed like that. But Purina also doesnt use fixed formula which means as long as the crude analysis hits certain parameters they can throw any old thing in it. With the ribbybelly look I bet youre also seeing a poorer quality coat and hooves because thats usually a symptom of protein deficiency. Ive become a big fan of straights this friend switched her horses to a diet of alfalfa pellets and rice bran in a  weight ratio with a vitaminmineral balancing top dress and Ive never seen them look better. Another feed worth trying if you still really prefer one bag is Crypto Aero its a blend of straights and not a milled pellet with god knows what in it. Also hay give her as much as she will eat. Even on full summer grass my horse was downing    a bale a day.
