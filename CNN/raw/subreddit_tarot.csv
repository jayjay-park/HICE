44777,0,t3_1thf9e,My first deck was the Spanish Tarot. It was a very chatty deck always spitting out cards when they feel that the current spread didnt explain the situation fully. They were very starved of love because their first owner a close friend made a very unnerving reading and didnt use the deck for  years before giving them to me.My current deck is the Manga Tarot deck by Minetti. I primarily chose it because of the stunning art and mainly because i fell asleep when I walked into a local book store and woke up with a receipt and a paper bag with the deck in it!,tarot,cejj1vw,1,t5_2qhu4

Custody BattlesArmy Brat lots of moving.. Lost a battlenot enough foresight to see breakup coming.. Heartbreak plain and simple. Work or job will get in his way be a factor in his next relationship.. He has a lot of karmabad habits that affect his love life.. You feel still bitterheartbroken over him so are interested in what hes doing. Youre making sure you know he isnt successful.. Dreaming and goalsetting are helpful in his love life whether or not he does it is a different story.. Mister has some major communication and thinking issues to overcome before he has a successful long term relationship.. Hes hoping he can overcome these bad habitskarma and can balance what he wants with what he needs.. This is another experience with who he is as a person and needs to recognize how he hurts others. In addition to reading your note the  of swords as a representative card of betrayal is hardly a positive card. He has got to cut some of this karma away from him in order for him to be happy and move forward.Secondary question. Yes it was his fault.. Lots of fighting emotional abuse verbal abuse by both parties lack of trust.. Strong and powerful need for affection and attention and neither was giving it to the other.. Major happenings last Earth cycle so Capricorn December January  this year.. In their less than royal surroundings.. Thats the letting go of the past and in this case the positive was the past and the present was just a horrible situation. How?

400968,0,t3_1ychln,Ive never gotten fatigue from reading myself nor did I get it when I read for my boyfriend. He was joking around with me as I shuffled so since we joke around a lot and laugh together a lot I really dont think I could feel fatigued from reading for him.I did my first two online readings for strangers yesterdayI just started reading for a websiteand that left me tired. I logged off briefly to take a break. I think what made me tired was that the first person while friendly and cooperative asked about a heavy subject. I knew Id get that type of thing but didnt anticipate it happening so soon. I dont plan to answer that type of question again because I dont want that stuff on my hands. However Im not going to say what their question was for the sake of confidentiality. This person favorited me and says theyll keep in touch which is nice since they seem like a nice person.The second querent sounded young and was pretty demanding and wanted me to tell them what they wanted to hear though my cards were saying otherwise. Im not doom and gloom but Ive never been the type to sugar coat so while I tried to give them an honest answer as best I could I felt a little like I was getting nowhere. Finally they seemed to accept what I was telling them. I logged off for a break right afterward but I dont plan on reading for this person again.I have a notebook that I bought to record the readings for others and I think itll help to get those readings off my mind so I can be ready for the next person. Since I do readings for myself and am getting acquainted with a deck I havent used as often I have a notebook specifically for me readings. It helped that I was in a coffee shop too because of their relaxing music. I think Ill have tea next time Im there... Tea is nice. I also put my deck back in order between readings so I could cleanse it of the energy from the previous readings.Since this is the first time Ive experienced this Id like to think itll go away with experience but maybe it also depends on the readers personality and the questions being asked. ,tarot,cfmbr2i,1,t5_2qhu4

They are similar in interpretation being that youre caught up in various options of temptation or choice before you.

718811,0,t1_cglxyzs,To me it was very curious the large amount of swords in this spread. The initial feeling I got was of disillusion when I saw the spread. It made me see what I knew already unconsciously but I was not willing to admit. I have to be clear reasonable and just with this situation.Here is what happens. She is a very special friend of mine. She met me in a difficult time for me when I was in a past relationship. I always liked her but never became more than friends because of my relationship. Eventually I had to stop seeing her because I developed feelings for her and when my then wife saw the friendship she kicked me out of the house. I had to stop the friendship because my breakup was too painful and she reminded me of it.Fast forward to now and skipping a few things. I messaged her after a year since last we spoke. She had moved far away. She is in a relationship with a person who cares for her. We write each other everyday we have always gotten along so well. It is so refreshing to have someone who listens to me who pays attention and we never run out of words to say.It is unfair for me to mess with what she has already built for herself.I guess it is possible for something to happen...but I would be taking a path that is more difficult and innecesary for both of us. I know the reasons. Thats what I think that  of cups means at the th position. To let go of that little idea that we should be together and just be the good friends weve always been. Probably by avoiding this I will meet someone who will bring me more pleasant experiences.,tarot,cglzdhj,3,t5_2qhu4

1056406,0,t3_264e9z,Interesting. I like this spread. Looking at the first three Id say weve got a situation where perhaps an unwanted pregnancy has occurred. Or perhaps some kind of medical condition has been discovered and the querent feels isolated alone not sure where to go for advice. Whomever the querent is turning to whether it be a friendfamily memberDr Philyou name it is actually NOT in an unbiased enough position to give the querent good advice. The querent has therefore been sort of forced into the Hermits energy. The reversal of the Queen of Cups makes me think that the querent is not willingly embracing the Hermits advice to search within and to get away from all the other voices in the situation. The Reversed Queen has left the querent a bitchy mess. Hormonal stuff? Thats my take  ,tarot,chod9au,1,t5_2qhu4

Anything you do she is going to take personally and hold a grudge. Just humor her and try to be nice tell her what she wants to hear and keep most of the problems directed away from yourself.

1104548,0,t3_26rp7u,Youve got some very beautiful artwork here and I love how much care has obviously been put into what you have. My only critique would be to consider how closely you want to hold the style between the cards. In general the drawing style the color choices etc are good. Your portrayal of people does vary though with one of the women there looking fairly close to anatomically correct one more cartoonish and one fairly realistic with the exception of the eyes. Keep in mind Im not saying it needs to match all the way across but I would just make sure that if you go that route youre doing it as a plan and with that purpose in mind. What you have really is very nice though and Ill be crossing my fingers and hoping you get a chance to finish the set.,tarot,chtudxm,7,t5_2qhu4
1203114,0,t3_27vxtk,Yeah I never read reversals.  Early on it just didnt make sense to me.  That doesnt mean cards cant have negative angles but generally itll come out that way no matter if its upside down or what.  I base it on intuition position in the spread context etc.  I figure each card has a hundred thousand different subtle nuanced meanings...if a card means all clear go for it theres another card that means wait or yourre being held back  and that would show up if it needed to.  I think reading reversals just unnecessarily complicates matters.,tarot,ci4yvm9,1,t5_2qhu4

1497341,0,t1_cj3rigi,. The Devil. The Emporer.  of Wands. Death.  of Hearts. Queen of Pentacles.  of Wands.  of Swords. Princess of Swords. The Hermit.  of WandsI really love doing this but sometimes it is difficult. The cards say something and you worry especially in a cold reading online if the person on the other end is ready to hear it. I debated about maybe not posting this one but I have to accept that I was meant to delivery this message and that somehow it will be helpful to you.The message I get is there is you may be too focused on the superficial the shallow the material right now.  You may have gained from this in the past but perhaps at the expense of others.  But I show recently there has been disappointment and maybe youre realizing there is a better way.  We all like to sit on high and judge others  it is natural  and I see that maybe you could actually be good at that but only if your intentions are pure.  You must be open to change and deal with others coming from a spirit of generosity not superiority and be careful not to criticize or judge to make yourself feel better.  If you keep that always in mind your communication with others will improve fairly quickly.  I rarely suggest this but seeing a professional may be a good thing for you if you find recent disappointments are too much to take or you are just feeling like you are not yourself. Others see you as someone highly intelligent if opinionated but full of new ideas so you have the potential to be a very positive influence.  Your attitude may be driven by fear of being alone but without a change you might end up just putting up barriers that will keep people out.I know this is not the most uplifting reading and if it does not resonate with you at all please feel free to ignore it and Ill assume I just wasnt able to connect with the other side today.Namaste.,tarot,cj3ysus,1,t5_2qhu4

My intuition is telling me that you will be the one who initiates the message.There is very little information you can get from a  card spread.

4132277,0,t3_37qmk1,Ooooh another Tarotscope column! I took a look it looks rather nice! I am fond of the layout of the page the inclusion of images and the clarity in the breakdown. For whatever it may be worth to you Ive been writing a Tarotscope column every week on my site since Novemberish and you can check them out hereTheyve done a lot for my exposure honestly  people seem to really like them and they earned some sponsorship from the Tarosophy peeps when I made them donationfunded. Tali Goodwin author and director of the Association privately messaged me and commended my work. This is mostly just me saying Hey this is working for me and maybe I can give you some tips so please dont be affronted by any constructive criticism!What it really comes down to is how much time you spend. The more time you spend the better and more revealing of your skill it will be. Currently it seems like the spread itself feels very piecebypiece IE Card A Card B Card C... the interpretations of the cards themselves are concise and OK if not a little vanilla but the overarching thing to me is there is very little context. To explain for me reading Tarot is looking at how the cards interrelate between one another and their spread positions  thats what gives rise to a story and what enables the Tarot to communicate nearly anything. No offense meant but if there is no context youre not really interpretingreading youre reciting. Not to put too fine a point on it but the interpretations solid as they are on their own feel a little cut amp paste which became very noticeable in looking at the Lovers in position  in two spreads. Aries amp Pisces This may be efficient and save time but from a readers perspective it feels uninspired. A lot of astrology columns like my favorite this one present things in that narrative style and makes them fun and engaging which seems to be a winning formula for things like this. But thats my opinion  I spend a lot of time writing mine because Im naturally a fan of writing with inspiration. Im about to get started for this coming weeks and it usually takes a few hours. You may not have time for that and you may not rely on the Tarotscopes to showcase your reading style and set yourself apart from other readers as I do. It seems like your site has a lot going on and its difficult to carve out time to write an original column every week especially if you have lots of responsibilities that demand your time. Around week  I was feeling really burnt out and then changed it to a donationbasis and its been feeling a lot better since. But yours is monthly and even with five cards spending a few hours each month writing an original piece for each sign would probably go a really long way.Above all I would just strongly recommend avoiding the copypaste. It just isnt quality and it really misrepresents actual tarot reading. These interpretations may as well have been lifted straight out of a book. Thats as harsh as it gets I promise!Good luck! Im excited to see how they turn out ,tarot,crraxou,1,t5_2qhu4

One has flowers crosses masks and butterflies the other is Sherlock Holmes based and I dont know them off the top of my head but the suits have been changed to suit detective work. I think you are fine but I also believe in the theosophical concept of thought forms. Over the years power has been built through collective consciousness into the traditional suits. You will forfeit some of the universal archetypal power of the suits in order to make them more personal to you. Valid choice and may enhance reading but not entirely without consequence. ,tarot,csc631s,1,t5_2qhu4

4797374,0,t1_ctz1fd3,You dont have to have a traditional deck with major arcana and minor arcana. There are plenty of oracle decks that dont follow tarot tradition at all. If you make your own deck you can assign whatever meanings to any design. And if you want a traditional tarot keep your deck on you. A couple times a day draw a card while asking just to describe whats going on in the present moment. Youll link the cards you draw to what is happening in real time so youll get a sense of what they mean.You can also get a tarot course book Lots of books have guides exercises towards learning the cards so you can interact with them as you learn.

Its only been two months but I am so in tune with that deck and vice versa. I had a bad couple days at work and I was pulling cards to see the result of an incident that happened.

6575874,0,t3_45qct4,I find two things wrong here. One youre reading about a third party which I consider unethical if you dont have his permission. Secondly a yesno reading is rarely possible or even desirable. Its much better to phrase things in the context of the querent. What should I know about my husband and my relationship? Etc. To me both of those together would be a kind of emotional stinginess and unwillingness to share feelings with others. Especially with regards to inverted lovers. This could potentially point to infidelity but I feel the inverted King of Pentacles would have a hard time opening up to anyone so a mistress seems unlikely.  ,tarot,czzhznm,8,t5_2qhu4
6677430,0,t3_473wun,emperor reversed might suggest that you are wishing for a relationship that is spontaneous fun and balanced. in this sense you could see the emperor reversed as reflecting that what you want in the relationship boils down to the foundation of the relationship itself and that you want this foundation to be something agreeable to you and not simply imposed. of pents may be speaking to the other persons desire for a relationship that is truly harmonious and worth staying in. this may be where you two have a common interest  both of you want to thoroughly assess the relationship as it is now and to make necessary changes accordingly. however whether you two agree on what needs to change depends on how closely your respective views align with each other. for instance do you feel alone in your desire for say less rigidity in the relationship? then you may want to talk to him about that. of cups seems like a welcomed outcome and the card here is possibly telling you that this outcome is realizable. but as a water card it bonds with the earth card  of pents  for better or worse. in other words there needs to be mutual effort on both sides to talk things out with each other and change what needs to be changed  or else the situation is likely to not have such a happy future. be careful not to value his desires and preferences over your own because this card conflicts with emperor reversed which speaks of what you want from the relationship.,tarot,d0a065c,1,t5_2qhu4

7154048,0,t3_4dhkkr,Hmm this is a very interesting questions Im excited to answer on multiple points. For me personally I generally consider the Tarot a tool to gain understanding from an outside unbiased perspective to view things in a new light. Sometimes you can use it to try to understand another persons feelings or other things you wouldnt be able to gain insight on without a divination tool. Considering I am also somewhat new to Tarot its an interesting idea to say that a persons mental state may affect the outcome of a reading. In my opinion the best example I can use is between a person who has honestly studied the cards and developed a feel for them versus a person who is using it as a game. The dedicated person will most likely get more serious and in depth readings. But when it comes to a mentalsocial deficiency Im unsure as to how this could affect your readings personally. I also struggle in social situations and I have a severe anxiety I tend to use the Tarot to pinpoint aspects of my personality that are holding me down. Generally the Tarot for me is a tool that I use to grow myself intuitively and within my personality. I like to think of the Major cards that appear as people giving advice. ,tarot,d1rcen9,1,t5_2qhu4

I drew the reversed high priestess. This card is actually one of the most psychic in the whole deck. Im curious if you have gifts that you are either not using or choosing to ignore? I only say this because it is reversed. That being said this is a highly sexual card and just says you had a hard time tapping into the right head space at times in your life.What is your present? I drew the heirophant. Thats actually my birthday card ha! This card basically says you need to get involved or are? involved in some type of organization. This card says youre trying to do the right thing even if you dont know what that is. But youre determined and trying. This says right now you are trying to follow the rules as best as you can.What is advice? I drew the  of swords. This is a high anxiety card. It says practice your breathing. I am interpreting this card to mean that your anxiety and fear is what is getting in your way right now. Youre going to have to release that to move forward. This says to slow down your brain and just try to embrace moments for what they are and not what youre projecting them to be. I wish you the best. Good luck. lt,tarot,d24o54i,1,t5_2qhu4

8091125,0,t1_d4pi7lv,Youre welcome.  Its my pleasure to help.What Im saying is that even from your words you dont sound grounded or are making decisions based off of infatuation and a less mature mindset.Heres an analogy  Sure you can try to drive across the United States in a car with oil leaks cracked windshield and missing floorboard.  But wouldnt you rather get all or at least most of the major issues fixed first?  Otherwise you might get stranded and have to abandon the car in the middle of nowhere.So regardless of copilot girl or destination relationship goal if you havent taken care of your vehicle mindset you likely cant get there on its own or trying to fix it along the way.I invite you to consider you maybe infatuated andor fearful for your future so you want to go with this girl NOW NOW NOW before youve taken care of yourself first.

Lets see if we agree!This spread seems to be all about decisions and I get the sense that youre usually good at making them but youre facing a sticky one. While you should be queen of your castle your authority is undermined by trying to please everyone. Youre scared of making a bad decision because a similar situation went real bad in the past and presently youre holding a lot of peoples resources and futures in your hot little hands. You feel really responsible and kinda lonely about that and its stressing you out way too much and probably youre taking it out on your closest few. You have big hopes and plans for everyone but the best you can personally expect from successfully resolving this situation is being called on to make a lot more difficult decisions in the future.

If you have a themed deck theres a chance you can get orientation out of the court cards which adds another element to it all. I used a Pirates of the Caribbean deck once that had oriented JQK cards and those helped. Interestingly one of me readings with that deck had all the queens in it so that was another crossover.

9383810,0,t3_58s6o8,A really simple advise play with them! Set them out look at the cards look at the pretty pictures think of what they remind you of or shuffle the deck and draw random few cards in order and make a story based on the cards you drew. Put them in groups of similar colour themes patters feelings of negative positive neutrals etc.  Never mind using them to only do spreads. Reading tarot comes only when you are familiar with the meanings and the cards themselves when you eel comfortable with them.  There is also a possibility that an ethereal being is blocking you from using tarot. This is whats happening with me and no matter how much I try I cannot seem to push myself to do anything with tarotrunespendulum at the time when the being is around. Try playing with your cards during morning or midday I think it will be less likely on those times that something might be blocking you.,tarot,d95gph4,1,t5_2qhu4

9471460,0,t1_d9gg7q8,Thats a good point. Well most of my clients only tell me their names their date of birth and their sign. So there you go. Just like you said. Some feel the need to share other details. In that case I do my best to warn them about potential projection on my part. I ask them what THEY think they should do.Always a great question. And great advice. Projection is good in a sense. Because you CAN relate deeply with the client. And people choose you for a reason. That reason usually has to do with what youve been through yourself. So this is where honesty comes in I suppose. So I do my best to be as authentic and human as possible and give down to earth and rational advice. Like stop trying to get into your lovers head and start getting to the bottom of your own struggle. Thank you for the input! Its very helpful. ,tarot,d9gk9f9,1,t5_2qhu4

9555510,0,t3_5bsh5f,Okay first of all your not cursed and no one can ever curse you. Basically theres no such thing as a curse. Doesnt exist.And tarot cards are not harmful to anyone. The reading is just showing your future. Thats what tarot cards are meant for. They cant put bad upon anyone and I actually wish you gave the cards to me lol. Dying for a deck of them.If youre feeling a lot of negative energy it could be that your attracting it by thinking negatively. Thinking that the tarot cards gave you a curse which they didnt and your life is going bad will probably ACTUALLY make your life go bad.So stop thinking so negatively. If you feel negativity in your home buy some sage and say a prayer inside your home while you light it. Doesnt have to be religious. Just ask the light to protect you from the darkness. Close your eyes and imagine the light protecting you from darkness. It helps.If you cannot buy sage mixing water and salt together will work the same. If you feel the negativity is stuck on you. Take a bowl of salt water and wash your body with it in the shower. Good luck! And if you have any more questions. Feel free to pm.,tarot,d9qwvz0,5,t5_2qhu4
9575700,0,t1_d9tbgg2,I dont believe the tower is always inherently bad. I think that is far too much of a literal interpretation of the cards.

9679909,0,t3_5dp24u,I personally dont trust the Tarot with should I X questions  I think its a better idea to use it to reflect more on your own position and understand your own emotions more. From that perspective.....King of Pentacles  this suggests where your relationship is strongest  a solid base of connection a mood in which you both can be yourselves and relax with each other. Do you see that in your relationship?Three of Wands  the beginning of a cycle! Wands is about motivation the gogetter spirit. If I got this card I would try to think if saying I love you and being honest about my emotions like that was important to me at this time. Maybe the  is saying the hold on to your emotions and not let them run about like crazy. Wands can be about control being firm with your impulses. Do you need to say I love you?,tarot,da693u6,5,t5_2qhu4

9785703,0,t1_daj45tt,A classic intuitive read for me involves using a deck of playing cards which is one of my favorite decks to use especially if the deck belongs to the person in reading for. When I read off a deck of playing cards I only have the numbers and suits to read from so it forces me to paint the picture in my mind. It creates very simple and direct reading with a lot of the recipients personality coming through. Each deck has its own story telling style for me its like going to see a movie I know nothing about beforehand you just take it as it appears in the moment.Its not that Im judging your writing skills its just a very unique and beautiful looking deck that I think would be fun to encounter with no preconceptions beyond what I see in the imagery.,tarot,dajauik,2,t5_2qhu4
9793169,0,t1_dak6imo,For the first dream I remembered it well enough to kind of guess what it was once I was awake... and it turns out its not exactly a unique spread but its been super valuable to me.

What should I do right now?The nd spread was  cards and was to help process past eventsmemories. I cant quite remember what the positions meant but I felt like the last card was something like What should I do when I remember this in the future?. ,tarot,dak7y2i,2,t5_2qhu4
9838392,0,t3_5g6y9w,Interpretation can sometimes depend on which deck youre using.My personal thoughts though The Wheel of Fortune in a reading like this is usually a good sign though thats not to say youll get the job. I think its there to remind you that whatever happens that is whats going to be the best for you.The High Priestess... I tend to read her as a bit sassy. Whenever she comes up for me its usually because my deck is telling me You know the answer already. She doesnt want to give you an answer even though she knows the answer. Shes watching you flounder and struggle and just kinda shrugs like Eh youll figure it out.I mean shes not too concerned so it cant be BAD.... The way I look at this whole reading is that whoever is making the decision on whether or not to hire you is facing a difficult decision. Maybe someone else equally qualified applied as well and they have to choose between the two of you. But whatever happens things are going to go your way and things will turn out for the better. Its a positive reading although it doesnt really give you the answer you want.,tarot,dapyrfv,2,t5_2qhu4
9876768,0,t3_5gtjgi,Seven of pentacles usually means weighing options and thinking about change. Something will have to be cut away the one pentacle off the vine to make everything else grow.,tarot,dauys2o,1,t5_2qhu4
9897679,0,t1_daxkx2l,Well based of this Id say it will be good.The three cards drawn are the Empress reversed the Eight of Cups and the Star.The Empress reversed represents thoughtfulness and caution but also traditionally infertility and impotence. This last point I often take to refer to productivity in any sphere for example creativity.The Eight of Cups is a classic for moving it represents letting go of something and moving on  setting out in search for new and better things.Finally the Star is a nice omen. Hope and newly found confidence especially after a crisis of sorts cf. the Tower which precedes it in the major arcana. The sort of emotions one experiences in the calm after the storm.So one way to read this would be as a rational decision to move away from an unproductive environment which will lead to all the good feels the Star represents. So at least the move will feel good initially as for details on continued life there I dont feel like this reading was adequate perhaps once Ive done the other folk who have requested a reading Ill come back and do a more detailed one Im already finding it strange to do readings like this without having a person to interact with. interesting,tarot,daxovz3,2,t5_2qhu4
9911548,0,t3_5hb6to,In my experience tarot does not predict it communicates. These readings are a way for spirit to pass a message or to take you to action. If taking action means you need to think someone will love you then so shall you believe. Do you understand the intricacies now? The future can be told only if it is useful and you have the level to absorb it in a sane way. So tarot is organic not absolute  indeed. I find it cool kinda. ,tarot,dazhxg6,7,t5_2qhu4

10887927,0,t3_5vl3v3,I believe strongly that all tarot can carry both positive and negative connotations most of this I believe is tied to subconscious and where you are when youre doing your reading.  While its true that The Star is typically lightness and bright lets not forget that thats not all it is.  For many stars are guides  they lead travelers along paths and bring sailors home safely.  Stars are trusted guides.  Right?  But maybe youve been putting too much attention on what someone else is trying to direct you to do walk a path that is more theirs than yours come to a destination or conclusion that doesnt quite fit you. Perhaps the sour in your reading is a reminder that you should not pay too much attention to others if they are trying to lead you in a certain way?  The Star can also be a distraction.  Do you see how brightly she shines compared to the other stars in the sky?  See how she pulls at your attention so that youre maybe not paying as much attention to the things around it?  Perhaps your sour is a reminder to not be blinded by one aspect of something  a warning to look for the darker side of things perhaps?,tarot,de30g2u,14,t5_2qhu4

10998191,0,t3_5x1qfx,really the same card again and again? Tarot coincidences are just mind boggling at times I swear!The Hermit symbolizes quiet reflection. A sacred pause from the hubub of ordinary routine in order to find a deeper understanding within yourself. This can be in regards to self reflection and discovery or finding a solution to a matter outside yourself. The figure in the RWS card is spending quiet alone time to find inner light then letting it shine to aid others on a similar quest. Some people identify with either the student or the teacher representation since both are depicted. Like someone over coming something then being able to share their story to help lead others to do the same.Hearing that what key phrases stick out to you? This will help you form your own interpretation and realize how that card symbolizes you right now.My interpration is that youre needing to resolve a matter in your life by self reflection about it. By taking quality TLC treatyoself time youll be able to silently come to an acceptance. The exact nature of what youre in need of reflecting over is very personal Im sure.

11379727,0,t3_62dq82,Hmm the spread looks to go downhill.

Maybe you both have expressed emotions in the past and its happening again or it happens all together quite frequently.The VII of swords does not look great. It could have a good meaning but what Im seeing is deceit. To turn a blind eye but to what? To the emotions of desire one of you had? To the cycle in play now?But then again perhaps the sword tells you to turn a blind eye to the cycle all together. To not let it rule you and let you and this friend decide on your own terms?My personal advice no cards here we do whats important to us.
