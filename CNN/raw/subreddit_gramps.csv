11667648,0,t3_65f0ov,Thanks for the reply!What I should have done at the start was create a blank tree with only sources and repositories. I didnt think of copying a tree and removing everything other than the sources and repositories. Thats a good idea!In the end I entered the sources and repositories into the second tree manually.Combining the trees isnt an option as the families arent related. They just have similar backgrounds and histories.,gramps,dgijklq,1,t5_2v3st
