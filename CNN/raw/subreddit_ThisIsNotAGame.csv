9893292,0,t1_dax3ypl,I dont think we can work together if youre unwilling to see that your point of view is just yours and your decision to look down on those of us who have the means the power in society and the voice to make pacifist resistance pretty damn powerful can use it as such. I have friends in high places. I have friends of friends in incredibly high places. If I was disappeared they could make it be an international story. And while I dont want to die if I were to die that would be more powerful than anything else I could possibly do. Im not saying everyone is in my position but I dont want you protecting me. I dont want anyone protecting me if it comes down to the dystopian world that I agree it could come to. Because if were at that point I would be more powerful in death than I am in life and Im cool with that. ,ThisIsNotAGame,dax4azo,1,t5_3hgqx

10428844,0,t1_dcpniac,I do agree with you. I think its wrong that he got assaulted. But I also think that it happening wasnt necessarily a bad thing for us. For starters the person that attacked him was white. It shows both him and his supporters that not all people are going to subscribe to their filthy ideology. It also shows them that people wont just bend over and take it. People will fight back. If fascists appreciate anything its displays of strength. Hitler would have laughed at pacifist displays before just having his Gestapo shoot them. Now Im not saying people should go out there and beat up Nazis. Not everyone can be Captain America but I am saying that people should put more thought into showing strength.Sometimes you need a little more than just disorganized marches. Sometimes you need to have stiffer resistance willing to get out there and obstruct traffic block roads and commerce and strategically capture and hold a building or two. Sometimes protests need to be a bit more militant to succeed. ,ThisIsNotAGame,dcq6fgw,3,t5_3hgqx
10604460,0,t3_5rpo0l,I like where your heart is but encouraging assault on white Trump supporters would be a field day for right leaning media and massively detrimental to any progress it made. Seriously this would rouse the white supremacists and simultaneously close some people off to the idea of Reddit forever.Ive been reading about the Russian state propaganda strategy of drowning moderately politically involved people in a deluge of information some less than true all of it serving to confuse and exhaust interest in fact checking. I think we should buzzfeed the right into doubting Trump. Really play up the fact that hes following a lot of steps fascists use to ascend to power and he did have that Hitler book!
