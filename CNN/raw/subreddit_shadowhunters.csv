6704139,0,t1_d0cjhog,Watch her fall for Alec and then watch Maryse try to push his son to be with Lydia for the political alliance. She will be a character that we will love to hate.I think that she will have depth but in the beginning she will be a cocky law abiding witch.Although I am very interested in finding out how Alec realizes that hes not actually in love with Jace...,shadowhunters,d0crl03,1,t5_2vhcb
6777552,0,t3_48g5zr,Great episode. I loved the way they are developing Alecs character. The proposal took me by surpise but as someone already pointed out hes doing what is best to help his family.,shadowhunters,d0kipb9,5,t5_2vhcb
6779119,0,t1_d0kafta,I think its another way that theyre showing how the majority of Shadowhunters are completely unprepared for Valentine even the Clave. They assume theyre safe at the Institute and that the Clave will take care of them so they arent always on their guard.,shadowhunters,d0kp3rk,4,t5_2vhcb

6856032,0,t1_d0tcp22,The pilot was very underwhelming. It was a lot of information and it seemed a bit scattered. The show is starting to really come together as each episode progresses so Im hoping the lackluster pilot doesnt kill the shows chances of having a second season.,shadowhunters,d0tfu3s,3,t5_2vhcb

7086911,0,t1_d1jg0pn,I really hope they are writing Lydia into Season . She grown to be such a badass and yet gentle character. Im sure they can figure out another arc for her. Shes been willing to drop the charges against Izzy and with the drama with Valentine coming up she could be essential in convincing the Clave to unite with downworlders against him.  ,shadowhunters,d1jo332,4,t5_2vhcb
7099891,0,t1_d1l3p8f,They said Sebastian would come in the series but they would need a s confirmation for it to work if they bring him in s. I wouldnt be surprised if they just dropped Sebastian in the s finale,shadowhunters,d1l56ym,1,t5_2vhcb
7104963,0,t1_d1l3p8f,My guess is that theyd want to introduce him as Sebastian in Season  and then could possibly reveal him as Jonathan Morgensternspoiler as the finale. Theyd almost have to be guaranteed a third season for it to have any effect though as itd be a gigantic cliffhanger,shadowhunters,d1lpyew,1,t5_2vhcb
7156637,0,t1_d1rldi7,I doubt that it will be early . I think Shadowhunters will follow the Stitchers model which is two seasons a year of  episodes. Currently Stitchers is on S with  episodes ordered. This business model allows FreeForm to order enough episodes to gauge interest without committing to a full  episode order.Personally I think the show will come back late summer to early fall. Right now besides PLL no other show on FreeForm generates nearly the rating or the social media buzz to garner attention for the network. FreeForm would be stupid to delay the shows premiere for  months. I would have serious doubts about their programming chief and marketing chief if they premiere the show in . Currently the only show capable of being a ratings juggernaut with a  month break is Game of Thrones and that has to do with the amount of free media that the show receives and the show being the most watchedillegally downloaded in the world. Even The Walking Dead breaks up their  episode seasons into two parts with three month breaks. A  month break between seasons would require a much larger marketing campaign to get viewers to tune into the new season again. A  month break however is what viewers have been trained by network televisions for decades to be an acceptable break so FreeForm wouldnt need to have a giant marketable campaign to remind viewers that the show is back. Also IMDB also lists the show coming back in .,shadowhunters,d1rn1nk,8,t5_2vhcb

10559052,0,t3_5r4v5p,Alec saying cool gills to Madsy was so adorable that smile too. Also his reaction to your boyfriend?  was hilarious. Im glad we got a little of Magnus backstory looking forward to seeing more. I wonder if well get any flashbacks? I need to see him in some cute historical outfits. Best character this episode has to be Lukes butt though.,shadowhunters,dd4zko2,34,t5_2vhcb

10696798,0,t1_ddj428g,True I suppose its just me being a little paranoid after some of my favourite shows ended up being damaged by writers doing stuff for shock factorsurprise twists at expense of consistencycharacter so hoping Shadowhunters doesnt go that route.Also heard something about a Clace kiss in A according to Todds Twitter which is interesting? Might just be a red herring though. ,shadowhunters,ddjamuf,2,t5_2vhcb
10733061,0,t3_5tjbop,Theres a couple! Youll see us pop in threads every once in a while. ,shadowhunters,ddn19ml,3,t5_2vhcb
10761686,0,t3_5tww69,That was a good episode. Can you guys believe were coming up on the end of A?  Malec was good but I wish they would have gotten a little more screen time. I loved that kiss and then they went to the room. I need to know whats happening behind that door!!!  SimonMaia are so cute. Just their interactions not even as a possible couple. Shes quickly becoming a favorite I spit in one was the best line of the whole episode.  Jace being ready at just the mention of Clarys name and that shes in trouble  melllllt.  I guess we wont get wayland manor since they just set Ithuriel free. Im curious what the vision meant. Next weeks episode looks exciting! ,shadowhunters,ddpzlc8,14,t5_2vhcb

11066783,0,t1_dembsbi,Its not strictly in the books. She does create a rune in the books that saves everyone but the scene happens differently enough in the books that the rune she creates there doesnt apply here. I want to say it has something to do with keeping the sword from being destroying or changing its affiliation somehow but thats just pure speculation at this point.Book spoilers gt Considering I suspect the person who left with the sword is none other than Sebastian who IS the demonic Morganstern and it wasnt destroyed the second he touched it Im guessing that its some sort of protection rune for the Sword.spoiler,shadowhunters,demeqyc,9,t5_2vhcb
11067132,0,t1_delvpvk,Its been a while since Ive read the books so I did some research and apparently Cassie mentioned it via twitter. I was glad that they didnt do Im asexual and they just wrote Im not interested in sex and mentioning that hes always been like that after Izzy asked him if it was becoming a vamp that made him that way. Just... yes. Yes yes yes.,shadowhunters,demg68m,10,t5_2vhcb
