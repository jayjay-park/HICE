7575353,0,t3_4j13qf,Yes what kind of gaming are you speaking of? There used to be a few LAN centersgaming places around town but those seem to all have vanished. If you are talking about board gamescard games we used to have a locally run game store in Palm Desert with weekly game nights but they too closed shop about a year ago. They still have a FB group that does occasional meetups however. If you are looking for card games i.e. Magic amp YuGiOh I know that there are a few groups that play in the cafeteria at COD.,CoachellaValley,d33a46t,2,t5_2rug6
