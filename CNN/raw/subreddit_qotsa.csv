107294,0,t1_ceqgy6j,Pretty much agree completely. Ask any Queens fan what their favorite album is and you will hear a different answer from each person. For example my personal favorite is the self titled and least favorite is Era Vulgaris but I know people who are the complete opposite. I would suggest either going chronologically or starting with SFTD since its the album that really brought them to the mainstream as well as the album that got me into them. Wouldnt be a terrible idea to start with Like Clockwork either though which has been giving them a slew of new fans recently.,qotsa,ceqnaxg,2,t5_2sbyp

1674647,0,t3_2ddhxf,. Turnin On the Screw  This is just such a great song.  Great riff great rhythm awesome live to me its the quintessential Queens song.. Into the Hollow  to me this song is all about the build.  So much tension so much groove.. Misfit Love  something about this songs relentless drive just hooks me.. Suture Up Your Future  One thing I think is constantly overlooked for the Queens is their ability to write and preform an amazingly powerful slower song.  This song slays me.  So melodic but without bringing on sleepy time.. Im Designer  Great song completely irreverent but still rocking.  Like most of this record I didnt like it at first.. but now  I love it.  That chorus is just so thick...  I counterfeit myself..... Run Pig Run  Great rhythm and the whistles always catch me.  Not the greatest song theyve ever done nor the strongest album closer in my opinion but not a bad song.. Make it wit chu  I always felt like this song has been around forever and they keep rehashing it.. Good song solid.  Just nothing too special in my opinion. . Sick Sick Sick  At first I really hated this song.  I thought it was lazy and just pointless.  Then I saw it live.  Now I love it.  The way all the parts come together in the end and just turn into an amazing wall of energy and sound... great song... makes me sorry to have ever doubted.... s and s  Like Sick Sick Sick I didnt really like this song at first.  Then i heard it live and now its like a whole new animal for me.. Battery Acid  I really dont like this song its only redeeming quality to me is the chorus.  The chorus is killer.  . River in the Road  This to me sounded like something they werent really into but needed to fill space.  I know its more than that but I just never really got it.  Maybe its the pseudo polka beat or that it really doesnt go anywhere... never really dug it. Overall this is my least favorite Queens record.  It just seems so scatterbrained and I cant find any continuity to it.  Not to say there arent some absolutely great songs on it but thats all they are... a collection of a few great songs some filler and some in between.  Every other album has a theme.. a sound... something to tie it all together.  To me thats missing here.  I would have been very bummed if this was how the band went out luckily ...LC completely reset everything.,qotsa,cjq91xa,3,t5_2sbyp

Started off with Lullabies and then Songs for the Deaf and played the hell out of both until they had grown on me to the point that I began inhaling pretty much any QOTSA I could get. Im still partial to the more accessible music QOTSA does like If I Had A Tail and Make It Wit Chu but every song literally has grown on me to the point that I sit in awe of the diverse structure of each song on every album. What used to be my least favorite QOTSA songs  the covers like Going Out West Might Like You Better and that Bob Dylan tune  have started to grow on me. Still not crazy about Christian Brothers though.

I know many people suggest such a thing with artist and of course there are people who suggest just the few popular albums.a million in prizes the anthology is plentiful and full of material that touches every album of his career including the Stooges upon its release in . it runs from The Stooges selftitled  debut album to s Skull Ring. i think if you enjoy what you hear once you get through it then maybe start attacking the releases in order. merely my suggestion. if you would rather not do that after hearing his greatest hits then maybe just check out The Idiot and Lust For Life in full considering Post Pop Depression tends to shine elements from them.,qotsa,czec443,5,t5_2sbyp

A lot of the more sought after albums from this period have been reissued by now but Songs For The Deaf for some reason hasnt which is why it is so hard to find and expensive on vinyl.I dont why it hasnt been reissued at this point but unless theres some sort of legal issue stopping them I imagine the album will be  reissued soonish.

9292020,0,t3_57peic,This is one of the most beautiful songs that Queens has ever recorded. Joshs almost frail vocals in the verses perfectly compliment his incredibly strong signing in the chorus. This songs lyrics are really the highpoint of the song. Theyre some of the most beautiful and poignant lyrics that Josh has ever written prior to ...Like Clockwork.

Its a hiphop duo and they are absofuckinglutely amazing. To me QOTSA will always be  but RTJ is a very close second and I dont even like raphiphop that much at all. Best way to describe RTJ would be fuckyourfacebeats with fuckyourmindlyrics and what you get is an awesome combination. P.S.
