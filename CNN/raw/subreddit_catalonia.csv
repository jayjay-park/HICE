3340402,0,t1_cp5ajru,Gay marriage is included although the wording is a little odd Basically it says that men and women have the right to marry irrespective of the sexual orientation of their freelychosen partner.I would argue that this clause should probably be rewritten to make it clearer. Something like Every man and every woman have the right to marry irrespective of the gender of their freely chosen partner. The way its written now makes it sound like A man can freely marry a lesbian if he likes which is fine but surely not the intention of the clause!!.Adoption doesnt seem to be mentioned anywhere. I guess that would be considered not a universal enough topic to include in the constitution itself.I suspect that the separaci de bns will continue as it is now because its considered to be a basic tenet of Catalan law one of the many little things which IMO prove that Catalonia is more than just a region.,catalonia,cp913qc,2,t5_2sau7

I say that because when a consitutional commission finish a constitutional draft they also present the constitution to the parliament but that is not the caseThere are more organizations like Reinicia Catalunya or Una Nova Constituci  writing proposals of constitutions they will deliver those proposals to the Study Commission of the Constitutional Process MP will read it and take ideas to write the real constitution.,catalonia,d32xqwu,1,t5_2sau7
