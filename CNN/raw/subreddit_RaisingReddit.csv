574172,0,t3_20owg7,I think part of getting older is that you realize you arent going to be and dont want to be friends with everyone you know.  As Ive grown older my social circle has shrunk quite a bit.  However the friends I do have now are much closer and important to me and people that I can count on as opposed to just casual acquaintances that Im friendly with.  I guess its turned into quality over quantity.,RaisingReddit,cg5jdmz,3,t5_30zle

605431,0,t1_cg935xi,No problem. Like I said  it would have helped me in the past to have a resource such as this. I grew up fast in a way and didnt have a role model so to speak that I could use as a guide. My parents werent very knowledgeable on certain things that I was going through not their fault and so werent the best resource. No reason we cant still be raised by the village. This place just expands the boundaries of that village. Or at least aims to. ,RaisingReddit,cg93a0u,2,t5_30zle
