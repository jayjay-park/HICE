SOE is apparently thinking of making it one subscription fee for access to a membership for all of their games which would be pretty cool. spchibivinylIt depends on the game mainly some of the older ones didnt let demons level up at all but pretty much all of the new ones theyll learn a few skills as they level up too. The higher level they get from their base level the more xp it requires to level them up though until it gets to be so much that its a lot easier to just fuse them into a new one and use that. Theyre really good.Heh ya I suppose so. It was pretty popular back when I was in middle school and I havent really heard anyone talk about it since then. Oh thats what its from.

226221,0,t3_1wp502, Ive started to like anime since I watched Attack on Titan. Im just now getting started on Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood. Anime is like a breath of fresh air for me. Ive decided that statistics is actually really fucking cool I had to figure out standard deviation the normal model and zscores tonight and man I had a blast it all made so much sense but it wasnt easy per say. And here I was thinking that taking a collegelevel Stats course would be burdensome and no fun. Im loving this. The numbers I know what they mean. Ive never been bad at math but Ive also never really had an interest in it. I have one now. Analyzing data is pretty enjoyable.  Ive been making spreadsheets like none other. Excel is dope. Ive been playing a fair amount of Starbound.  Ive been reading a lot of Kurt Vonnegut.Other than that... Nothing new or out of the ordinary for me.Im really liking trying all these new things though. Its like Im slowly breaking out of a rut Ive been in for the past three years. I think Im going to try and get back into biking and for the spring semester I think I might try out an intro to comp sci. course or something of that nature. Im really enjoying embracing my... I dunno geeky side I guess. Its less stuffy than the typical psychology English and history courses I take. Not that I dont like that stuff but its good to try out new stuff. Its like Im embracing modernity and taking an interest in the future and the present instead of being rooted in the past. Im really digging that feeling. While my typical course load is very interesting its pretty much never exciting. It offers very little to figure out only a lot to understand.,MLPLounge,cf470yj,3,t5_2t403

293761,0,t1_cfb6uo3,fluttertwikiss If you want to skip to the meat  go to the bolded words below.The answer is simple. Its either a terrible clopfic where one of Twilights love spells goes horribly wrong or maybe a Cadance love spell which gets jumbled up by Twi or alternatively you just have the most interactive of the mane  together.PuddingRainbow Dash is the most diverse you can ship her with Fluttershy Pinkie Pie Twilight and Applejack quite easily. The only one I dont see as a natural pairing for Rainbow Dash is Rarity but thats fine.Applejack is the next most diverse. You can pair her up with Rainbow Dash and Rarity though her shipping with Pinkie has gotten a bit more difficult since Pinkie Apple Pie. I couldnt pair her with Fluttershy and Twilight would be a stretch.Rarity pairs with Applejack and Rainbow Dash and can be paired with Twilight too. Id struggle to pair her with Fluttershy or Pinkie though.Twilight can be paired with Rainbow Dash and Rarity. Though Id struggle to pair her with Pinkie Applejack or Fluttershy.Pinkie and Fluttershy are the hardest two to pair up. I could see Pinkie and Dashie but not much on anyone else. Fluttershy pretty much exclusively goes with Dashie. Best bitEssentially what you have here is an orgy centred mostly around Rainbow Dash.I could imagine Rainbow Dash giving Fluttershy some heavy petting whilst simultaneously getting Pinkie off with a phalicshaped balloon.On Dashies lower end youd have Applejack giving her a good scissoring whilst getting off with Rarity who is being done by Twilights big magical strapon.Tadah mane  orgy.,MLPLounge,cfb7p8e,2,t5_2t403

It is based five years after the events of Chrono Trigger and features all the playable characters from the original game who come together across different time periods to fight an enemy attempting to change the past. The plot includes elements from both official games. Crimson Echoes concludes by setting up several plot points that were used in Chrono Cross.gtThe project was in development from  with  of the game completed. The game reportedly totaled around hours of play time and had ten alternate endings. A few weeks prior to the expected released date Square Enix sent the developers a ceaseanddesist letter which led to the immediate cancellation of the project. This cancellation was widely reported in the gaming press who were largely sympathetic to the project. Despite its cancellation versions of the game ranging from an alpha to a release candidate have since been leaked onto the internet and can be played through to the end.gtgtImage iInteresting Chrono Trigger | List of fiction employing parallel universes | List of Square Enix video games | The Art of Video Games uGaldion can reply with delete.

357799,0,t3_1y5xld,raritywut This is something I just cant understand both drunk driving and not wearing a seat belt. Ever since I can remember my mom always got on my case about wearing a seat belt so its just instinct. Even if Im going down the road to a friends house Id put it on. It just seems ridiculous to not to since it only takes maybe a second or . I have a cousin who forgets sometimes but he was raised on a farm and they would often drive a pickup around to gather stuff and so they were consistently getting in and out of the truck so he got used to not wearing one. Even still I get on his case about it.raritynews As for drunk driving I have no feelings for you other then disgust. Have I been drunk before and been a place that I would technically need to drive my car away from later? Yes. Have I ever done it? No. The thought never crossed my mind. I went to a party at a friends house once and after getting in heavy I just went back and slept in my car. I have also called cabs and if the situation had arisen I wouldnt mind calling family or friends. Its not just irresponsible to yourself. I could care less if you want to do that to yourself thats your own stupidity. The issue is youre driving a huge metal beast and youre endangering other people and that is where we really have a problem.rarityhasadrink Be smart peeps. I know a lot of you already are but please be smart. Even if youre in a situation where you know you can get in trouble for having been drinking always get someone else to drive. I had a friend once who got stuck downtown pretty wasted once. He actually went to a cop and requested help. The cop was nice enough to help him get home. I know another friend who got drunk once at  years old. He had snuck out of his house. But he was smart enough that he realized that he needed help so he called his dad. Got in trouble but saved a possible lifetime worth of horror. Be smart my friends.This is truly a sad story and I hope those grieving can find some form of comfort and move past this eventually. It wont be easy. Best wishes,MLPLounge,cfhuolo,3,t5_2t403

392252,0,t1_cflewc6,This is the text I copied from the blog youll notice that the line you quoted does not appear Updating our Terms of Service Privacy Policy and Dropbox for Business AgreementPosted by Ramsey Homsany on February  Weve made a lot of changes to Dropbox since we last updated our Terms of Service Privacy Policy and online Dropbox for Business Agreements. So today were starting to email users to let you know about some updates to these policies. The updates will be effective on March  .We know that these types of updates are really important to you and we want to help you understand them. Heres a walkthrough of the major changes    Arbitration. Were adding arbitration clauses to our Terms of Service and Dropbox for Business online agreement. Arbitration is a faster and more efficient way to resolve legal disputes and it provides a good alternative to things like state or federal courts where the process could take months or even years. If you prefer to opt out of arbitration in the Terms of Service theres no need to fax us or trek to the post office  just fill out this quick online form.    Permissions. We care about having Terms of Service that are readable give the right amount of context and avoid unnecessary legalese so weve updated our language to better match the permissions you give us with the features you use. For example to provide you with document previews our automated systems need permission to access and scan your stuff for those previews  so we explain this in the new Terms.    Privacy Policy. Weve clarified several sections of our Privacy Policy to better explain how our services use your information. Take contacts for example. When you give us access to your contacts well store them so that you  and only you  can easily share your stuff regardless of whether youre using Dropbox on your phone tablet or home computer. Weve also added a section explaining our recently launched Government Data Request Principles which describe our commitment to protecting your privacy when handling government requests.    Mailbox. Its been almost a year since Mailbox joined the Dropbox family and were finally transitioning the app to the same Terms of Service and Privacy Policy as the rest of Dropbox.    Dropbox for Business. Weve made great leaps over the past year as weve grown and developed Dropbox for Business to help companies work smarter. Our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy updates more clearly reflect the advancements weve built for admins and end users.We hope youll read the full Terms of Service Privacy Policy and Business Agreement. While weve simplified much of the language our commitment to keeping your stuff safe and secure hasnt changed. We dont sell your personal information to third parties. We dont serve ads based on the stuff you store in our services. And as always your stuff is yours.Over the next few days well be emailing all our users to ensure you hear about these updates from us.,MLPLounge,cflf8h2,1,t5_2t403

395630,0,t1_cflrm2o,Depends. Fallout  and  are classic isometric western RPGs of the s complete with turnbased combat lots of reading and nobody holding your hand. When you look for an awesome postapo climate sprinkled with some absurd and dark humour and you are willing to live through some oldRPG stuff there isnt a better title in the world.Fallout  is modern revival by Bethesda  FPP realtime combat casualized compared to F and F to levels of Oblivion and Skyrim. It has a nice atmosphere on its own but many argue that its not very fallouty. Still a great game.Fallout New Vegas is same when it comes to mechanics as Fallout  but it was made by Obsidian that consists of big chucks of team that worked on first two Fallouts. Climates are much closer to first games story is stronger and gives you more choice. On the other hand  its less polished than F FNV was rushed and much was cut.Id say  if you want to get some oldRPG action play them in order Fallout  gets a lot of slack from Fallout fans but its still a great title. If you want to quickly play something modern first Id personally say  go straight to Fallout New Vegas then Fallout  then if you like the universe try F and F.         When it comes to plot  these games arent really connected not counting references nods and lore. First two games happen partially in same area  west coast of US but plots are almost century apart Fallout  happens on the other side of the continent and FNV happens few decades after events of F back on west coast. So you can play each of them without experience with other games.,MLPLounge,cflru8g,3,t5_2t403

I read most of the research and articles I forgot to read the first one you linked I started with the second one and never went back.You didnt point out where my argument fails. Substantial evidence is necessary demonstrating the negative consequences of circumcision for me to be on board for the argument against it.

577024,0,t3_20pczm,One nice thing coming out of this has to do with the media. I remember a time when the media liked to poke fun at the bronies even to the point of mocking us on occasion. I live in the area and heard about this story yesterday on the radio. Live . covered it and asked listeners to call in and tell whether they thought the school was justified or completely ridiculous. Every single caller said that the school was out of line. Most callers had nothing to do with the bronies a few hadnt even heard of us but they were upset that this kids freedom was being infringed on. Every one voiced that if Grayson felt it was worth the risk of bullying to wear his backpack that was his right. A couple said something along the lines of its stupid a boy wears a my little pony backpack and he gets bullied then he gets punished for it. A girl wears a ninja turtle backpack and nobody even looks twice at her. Its a ridiculous double standard. One mom even called in said the same thing as the others then handed the phone to her son. Her nine year old son is a brony he wears a MLP backpack to school and he talked about why he likes the show about how he was initially bullied but it stopped after two weeks and encouraged Grayson. When the mom came back on she said that it was her sons choice to do this and she allowed him to after warning him that he may be teased or bullied for it. The radio hosts had nothing but positive things to say about Grayson and the bronies in general. They even had the extended version of this playing in the background the whole time.So yeah this situation sucks but at least its a minority sentiment that Grayson shouldnt be allowed to wear his backpack. Sure Bronies may not be popular in the public eye we may get teased or bullied on occasion by individuals. But it seems society as a whole is finally deciding that while were not normal theyll tolerate us and accept us. ,MLPLounge,cg5v1k3,1,t5_2t403

How hard are they swinging?Some of my favourite trombonists are Fred Wesley Tommy Dorsey and Glenn Miller if you dont already listen to them I highly recommend it.Also lots of practise. Get together with the other musicians as often as possible and just play music. And if you can find yourself a trombone teacher.

605541,0,t1_cg90ztn,Im  straight male Marine and into the same stuff you referred to. I was actually introduced to the show by another Marine and the truth is I cant really explain why I like it so much.Theres the standard responses like the characters the humor the animation the message but the spark was really the fandom itself. The amount of creativity in art music writing and various other forms just amazes me. Ive also been a huge Star Trek nerd since I was a kid and I dont see any more obsession with this fandom than I do in that one or that I see in Doctor Who since I started watching it. I do see it get a little pushy at times and there are trolls in any group of people but I try to remember that they are not representative of the whole.As the icing on the cake my  year old niece loves the fact that I can talk about the show with her. And even when she gets bored of it and moves onto something else Ill still be enjoying the artwork and intricate stories and fantastic artwork that people have made. If others want to judge me for that thats cool. I like the message of the show. If it takes watching candy colored ponies on a show made for girls to remind me to be a better person so be it. I just hope that as more people are exposed to the brony culture they can see that a show being made for girls doesnt necessarily mean its bad. I hope that people see that no one should be forced to conform to traditional gender based interests and realize they hold a double standard when they fail to judge a grown woman for enjoying action movies and shooting games.I appreciate you being honest and respectful about your opinion I know my response was more of a stream of consciousness than coherent but I hope its given you an additional perspective to consider.,MLPLounge,cg93q7x,3,t5_2t403

Its a failure to train failure to discipline thing. The individuals are often fired from their positions but depending on the severity of the incident they could be looking at criminal charges as well.Also people who treat others like that causing injury due to negligence or intentional wrong doing and then denying medical care DO NOT DESERVE TO BE OFFICERS. They have NO BUSINESS in the profession.

No descriptions of whats happening during these nsfw parts.There is also a sequel to this one but I havent started it yet and I dont know if its finished.EDITSorry this took so long.

Theres no street lights and I can see the full majesty of the milky way on dark nights.But then again I have few friends and no one to talk to other than ploungers. I was pretty depressed before I found the fandom the loneliness eats you up.spAbout the hacking. Yes Im not planning on doing anything serious and no I wont be doing it anytime soon. Im nowhere near experienced enough. Its just something Ive always wanted to do as a kid. Its part of my list of things to learn than I might never need to use. Sadly the only way how to learn is to practice so if I ever plan on doing so I will have to set up my own sites.ppsmirkAlso about the legality thing. There are plenty of countries Ive lived in that hardly have any law enforcement. Theres actually a legal pirate convention here every year due to loopholes in the laws. The US is tough on crime but other countries arent. Not that its an excuse just a fun fact that people tend to overlook.Havent you ever wanted to do something that could get you into enormous trouble just for fun? Its probably the most thrill seeking thing Ive ever wanted to do. However I can foresee horrific consequences so it will probably never happen. Thats why its a bucket list!rdhappyI agree solid goals are much more effective at making progress. However I just wanted to know what other people have always wanted to do.

873279,0,t1_ch3j90l,I dont think you understand the point Im trying to make. Im not saying that books are the only reason people arent that smart Im saying that the English language is getting butchered by the people that arent reading books. They dont understand how things like these should be structures and when you take away certain variables like those who balance out this language Hypothetical things are just fine but when you take out the one word that determines when something is being hypothetical or not how can we know that the thing that someone just said was not figurative and was indeed true?You said that using cool defines something that is populargood is dumb. I say the exact opposite. Saying such a thing makes sense if youre being figurative or hypothetical. Without the use of Literally we cant differentiate between something being true or false.What else would we use? Actually? Thats already been butchered to mean Very.Seriously? Thats just become a word that people throw in to their sentences when they need a filler.Honestly? Thats just become another word for Seriously in its new meaning.Fixing the English language is not going to start by letting people edit and fix words that they dont find work in their current situation weve got to start by stopping the destruction of a word that will get rid of the balance that weve formed with the rest of the rules that weve already created.,MLPLounge,ch3jnnn,-1,t5_2t403

Ive done no study on the matter but it seems to also have fewer grammatical errors. It also seems more epic with longer and deeper mysteries. Every time someone warns a new FOE reader that it can be a little dark or tragic or that Little Pip really has to earn her happy ending I agree that sure Pip goes through the wringer. But if Pip has earned one happy ending Blackjack has earned .While I like Kkats use of Chekhovs Guns and Gambit Pileups two of my favourite tropes Sombres narrative devices are a little more varied. Also Sombre does a great job interfacing with the FOE canon without stepping on any toesspoiler an admittedly impressive feat.Please dont get me wrong I love FOE.

It would download the servers sqlite database compare every entry and see which emotes it needs to update. Then download them.That way you can search everything and have all of the emotes.I also want to add a feature that would allow your to share the emote picture in Hangouts per say so you can bug your friends there. Should be easy to add that way.Ive got the database all figured out and the algorithm that compares the two done and running efficiently.

1069884,0,t1_chpw8hk,I can agree with that opinion but I do imagine the writers hear about as much negative response as positive just due to the detractors being more vocal than those who just silently enjoy the issue and leave it at that. True that you cant have just one side of the coin but my issue is that the onus should ideally be placed on whether or not a story is well crafted and told not how neatly it slots into showbook continuity. A few too many fans seem to place the latter as the higher priority and not just in this fandom.

1161488,0,t3_27fb83,The pony came to a halt. The sign that was supposed to declare what city it was proud to be was unintelligible after fifty years of winter cruelty. Even then the harsh winds tore a chunk off of the sign. The wind screamed and the pony ducked into a shabby run down house. Silence. It was warmer inside or so he thought. It was either the insulating walls of the house orthe pony shivered but not in coldor the incoming death warmth. The warmth that lulled ponies in comfortable eternal rest. How long had it been since his last meaningful rest anyway? His days as a soldier were more restful. That was long ago too long for him to think about wistfully. He dragged himself to a window. The wind was very well kept out by the windows. His leg didnt ache in this warm wonderful place. The moon was high in the sky as it always was. What time it was he never knew or cared about. But he did know it was lunch time. He ambled over to another room one with a faded and worn furnace. There were cupboards that hung off their hinges. Empty. And cold. Useless. Pathetic.The pony turned away angrily. His hoof struck the corner of the furnace. A sound broke the silence. A faint buzzing. A sound that the pony knew was why he used to be a soldier why he lost a hoof why his family was torn apart. Why the new empire flourished. The cold whirled around his warm house. He got up on his back legs. The chute that was supposed to deliver coal fumes out of the main body was broken in places. The buzzing intensified when the pony put his face near. He reached in with a hoof and brushed up against furry things that scurried away. He withdrew his hoof.It was covered in honey.,MLPLounge,ci0aaz8,3,t5_2t403

1210191,0,t1_ci5rahj,I dont actually have a life goal. My fathers was always to have a family and take care of us and hes pretty accomplished because of that. Were very close and I wouldnt trade them for the world. But me? I dont have the desire or social obligation to have a family. And its not like Im gonna get anyone knocked up and have it thrusted onto me. So I have no clue. No real goals or aspirations aside from getting my life stable and figuring out what the hell I wanna do for the next  ish years before I die.What gets me up in the morning? I guess the fact that theres nothing else to do. Laying in bed all day isnt exactly fun. Plus I have a dog to take care of that gets pretty sad if he doesnt have a bowl of foodwater out for him. He also likes to go on big walks and play with his toys. Hes basically like a son to me I guess or a kid brother. And I got to where I am now on the High School thing because... well I wasstill am clinically depressed around the time I really needed to buckle down and get my school under control. So now Ive got about a half credit of Algebra  left before Im done. Being medicated helps. Its like before I was getting help I was basically not able to function. Not being able to get out of bed most days really makes life hard. Been that way for about  years now.But Im getting help and doing much better!

And she singled me out to cold shoulder even more than others because I had already failed this class once and she said I dont know if even want to be friends with someone who isnt willing to apply themselves.Because she cold shouldered me so much it hindered my interactions with the rest of the class because I couldnt interact with anyone in her presence without getting a dirty look for the mere act of opening my mouth and others couldnt interact with me in her presence without getting a dirty look for interacting with me.As a result I may have lost one person who I thought I was good friends with and who I was hoping to continue hanging out with on a regular basis... ,MLPLounge,ci7usya,1,t5_2t403

1288723,0,t1_cielees,lunawink I more or less collected cards because thats what the popular kids did mind you these were athletes so a young me was easily lulled into thinking Id be awesome if I went into the game. Eventually I ended up collecting a lot of rare cards through all the allowance I wasted on boosters shame one day my mother got real angry one day and decided to throw the majority of em away. Later on I got into the GameboyDS games and loved them because I actually understood what was going on though sadly I have a lot of memories of being screwed over by the RNG Rare Hunter pulling an entire hand of Exodia in two turns seems legit.As for the Pokemon TCD we bozos more or less just fawned over the awesome pokemon... goddamn Charizards. I never got into it though.Edit Sorry for going on a nostalgia trip I kinda lost myself there.,MLPLounge,cieljcg,2,t5_2t403

You didnt really miss too much I think. Then again I couldnt point out what is normal and what is abnormal for plounge behavior.  I understood that you had a vacation that you were on and considering how much I know youve worked you deserve it. So yeah. I am pretty sure you coped without me pretty easily.

1571050,0,t1_cjczzxh,Even from my high school days I was and still am the type to wait to have sex until I was married so it was highly unlikely that I would have a baby before that point barring a very surprise adoption of a family member or if I were the victim of rape. Because I had already babysat a few times before having that simulation it really didnt show me anything I hadnt already figured out by that point. I believe it happened in my sophomore year if I recall correctly. The assignment was a bit over  years ago and I am married and would love to have a baby of my own now. ,MLPLounge,cjd7dqo,2,t5_2t403

1586379,0,t3_2cg5xc,I appreciate the point that there is a societal expectation but I wonder if youre overemphasizing how common the desire to be romantically and sexually alone or independent if you want a different connotation is.  Most people Ive met I think would genuinely prefer even a mediocre or perhaps outright bad relationship to no relationship at all ... or would at least come to that viewpoint if single for a few years.  Not that its fair that the people who really would rather not partake in such things have to deal with the assumption that the willshould anyway but I suspect that a statistical prior assuming that a random person would be more fulfilled in a relationship than not in the long term is probably pretty reasonable.  Of course I have no actual data to back this up so Im willing to be convinced otherwise.Speaking for myself having a partner is fucking awesome pun not intended but Ill take it anyway tavilyranuzzlei,MLPLounge,cjf4v4o,5,t5_2t403

None notable on the immediate horizon but I did kind of have a similar experience last week when I finished the muchunfinished business of moving residences last month.I have been in business school for nearly three years most people graduate in . or else fail out in  months I changed majors and dont regret it but the fastpaced life is taking its toll and have been forgetting what my life used to be like before it.In the course of moving I got to remember.I handled and went through the stuff that used to support my daily objectives.  Specifically I was heavy into supporting different charities in different ways and really got my hands dirty with a couple of them.  My parents were once horrified to see me on the news following the arrest of a friend after he robbed a skating rink.Bit by bit Id forgotten what I used to fight for take risks for and steadily lost momentum until I plopped neatly into the same life of isolated media indulgence as most other people.  Particularly after the different corporate tax courses I really got into a pattern of creeping into my hiding places and resting in TV until I had to come out and battle again.How far Id fallen.It was really moving to see the projects letters household stuff I used to have a house and decorations Judaica included.  I was fending off tears only because I needed to stay focused to finish in time.In the Old Testament book of Nehemiah the people collectively realize how far they themselves had slid into decadence.  Grief overtakes the entire crowd gathered the whole country.  But the priesthood assures them dont weep for Gods joy is your strength.I think Im going to try going with that.,MLPLounge,cjpk8yq,2,t5_2t403

As for not knowing how it actually works...everyones new at first! A lot of the time its coming up with an idea asking the GM if its legit and then the GM telling you to roll dice to see if your idea succeeds. Actually theres a DnD e intro adventure starting up next week and were looking for  more players. Our GM is asking around and we should know if theres an open spot by tomorrow. The other players so far are all ploungers too and since DnD e just came out all of us are new to the rules!

The game was a massive success when it first released and achieved great sales on the NES and later even better sales on the Game Boy. Due largely to a recent resurgence on mobile markets Tetris is the bestselling game of all time. I the game the player controls falling tetrominoes blocks that make up various shapes. The blocks fall from the top of the screen to the bottom and the player can move them into different aisles as well as turning them clockwise or counterclockwise. Once an entire row is full that row disappears giving the player points. The game gets harder and faster until the player fills the screen and loses or wins the game.,MLPLounge,cjzl1ru,2,t5_2t403

1795524,0,t1_ck5gihx,To anyone on the outside the story makes it seem like I lack that but it was a combination of things that made this happen I didnt plan on handling the gun for longer than a few seconds it had been in the gun cabinet or so I thought since I last when hunting  months earlier I was only gauging the weight of the gun in a firing stance to compare it to an Arisaka rifle not messing around with it like a kid would with a toy rifle etc.. My dad had loaded the gun a few days earlier when I wasnt home and fired it into the ground to scare off some people who were skulking around our yard then didnt unload it. Not an excuse for a negligent discharge but I am a staunch follower of gun safety any other time.The problem with a negligent discharge is that it labels you as lacking trigger discipline at all times to everyone. I probably deserve it but it stinks how a single lapse in judgement can follow you around for the rest of your life. ,MLPLounge,ck5h3sk,3,t5_2t403

1836598,0,t3_2flu42,macnopebait Ok just a tip for you that I guess Ill give you. We as a subreddit have gone over this several times in the past and while this time it is going better than average this isnt a well liked topic with a majority of folks here. Even allowing that there is some other realm that you can tap into to manifest a thoughtform that well label as a tulpa and mind you that is allowing more than a person shoving Mount Everest through the Holland tunnel the manner that people typically speak of when creating a tulpa goes against everything that the traditional knowledge of a tulpa is. You even spoke here about Tibetan monks creating tulpas as part of their enlightenment. This is true and they did this after years of meditation. Not after reading about it thinking hard for a few daysweeks and suddenly believing theyve created something that has a sentience to it. Humans can best do that with bad judgement and  months of waiting. ,MLPLounge,ckai8is,2,t5_2t403

Be the best you can be be nice to people do what makes you happy but also makes others happy. There are tough times in life sure but that just makes the rest stand out better.And lastly you arent just an insignificant dot. That part had me down for a few years until very recently.

1934179,0,t1_ckm8ghw,pillzhere Exactly this. I can not exagerate how much it annoys me when someone brings Fan fics into conversation when we watch the show or discuss an episode. Especially Grimdark or onion stories.As a writer of fan fics I try to keep the characters as close to their canon personality. And my main rule is to never go too deep in a romantic setting. When a person talks about Twidash or any main six romance I know it is just in their head and nothing in the show proves romance. I have good friends and I never ship them because there is no proof.I separate the show from fanmade content because it take away ffrom the innocence I like in the show. Theories are fine with background characters like Lyra but it stays online for me not on the tv screen where I watch the real story.,MLPLounge,ckm96zq,3,t5_2t403

And as far as actually fighting one goes have you ever felt a dog like a German Shepard pounce on you? It feels like a ton of bricks hitting you. now the average german shepard weighs between  lbs and a human weighs between  lbs.

2019658,0,t3_2hw4jm,An episode beginning with Pinkies father getting hurt. Seeking help on the rock farm they seek help from previous workers bringing the crack team of Maud Inkie Pinkie Trixie and Rarity together. Their mission to protect the farm from ponies who want to flip the property for profit ie Flim Flam brothers. The episode would focus on Pinkie Rarity and Trixie Maud Inkie and their mother would be their own team. Rarity and Trixie soon find out that for all her ridiculousness the one thing Pinkie takes very seriously is her home prompting her to be an excellent teacher and leader on how to work well on the rock farm despite some frantic bossing around at the onset of the project. The objective of this episode is to show Pinkie in a leadership position to further prove her worthiness of being a sitting Princess of Friendship. It also teaches Trixie that behind a talented leader even seemingly ordinary ponies can excel prompting her to say her performances would feature two fledgling illusionists who would really shine will the amazing leadership of the Great and Powerful Trixie!,MLPLounge,ckwkcxh,5,t5_2t403

2050961,0,t1_cl0gvht,Have you ever played Fallout  or Fallout New Vegas? Because Fallout Equestria really blended a bunch of Fallout tropes with MLP and created a great story. You wouldnt think a postapocalyptic wasteland would be a good place for telling stories of friendship amp kindness but it works.If you havent played either of those games some of the story wont make as much sense but you should be able to enjoy it. Fair warning there are some pretty graphic moments of violence.,MLPLounge,cl0itkm,2,t5_2t403
2051003,0,t3_2ib5wj,flutterthinksp You know it occurred to me. I actually watched Cory in the House when it was being aired and I didnt think too much of it. I actually thought it was above average every now and then. Sure most of it was just plain old stuff but the internet seems to really not like it. They also like it ironically though. Now I cant help but feel amused almost every time because of the irony. I will probably never watch an episode of it start to finish again but I will still enjoy seeing bits and pieces of it here and there because of that irony.

Never gets old.Plenty of soundtracks do use more modern kinds of music but youre right... all the good stuff seems to be played by ensembles they couldve whipped together in the nineteenth century.

Hes able to to balance energy silliness and epicness with breathtaking results. Like here!

2151423,0,t1_cld7m4s,Singersongwriter implies a specific relationship that the listener should expect to hear. Generally the music can typically be considered folk based on its restrictions but will vary on topic more than folk. Typically it is mainly a singer his or her own lyrics which can be a significant point in a world where many popular artists have lyrics written for them and a single instrument or whatever that musician can handle singularly.This may include such instruments such as guitar and a harmonica and minimal backing such as much of Jack Johnson Bob Dylans early years Id link his Freewheelin album but videos of his music is hard as hell to find online some Donovan Simon and Garfunkel. Admittedly Im a terrible resource for such music as I dont listen to the stuff much. Though right now Im listening to that Jack Johnson album for the first time in a long time and it feels really good.EDIT The Dodos is an indie band that does a lot of folk. Here is a relevant link.

2161058,0,t3_2jr89i,Im not sure if I understand your overall message. You began with the point that most ethical quandaries admit no obvious solution that everybody will wholeheartedly agree with that is that things arent just black and white. Sure I agree. Then you present caricatures of affirmative action and seem to be arguing that because these caricatures are obviously going to work out poorly affirmative action is a bad idea. Isnt that treating things as black and white a bit too much? Everybody whos proaffirmative actionokay everybody whos proaffirmative action and sane SJWs dont qualifyrealizes that affirmative action needs to be executed delicately in some kind of balance with all other concerns.,MLPLounge,cleiq0y,2,t5_2t403

While no pain isnt necessarily violent my argument was that your decision to inflict it is violent it does not matter if its agreed that its acceptable because all your doing is agreeing that a certain level of violence is ok.If what you argued was true then games couldnt be violent since a games intent isnt to harm anyone its purpose is entertainment. Yet we have plenty of games that are universally agreed upon to be violent.You seem to be trying to say that I couldnt possible find some entertainment value in violence when I clearly sated that I do. Changing your definition so it makes acts that are view as violent by society considered non violent does not change that.,MLPLounge,cm6m363,1,t5_2t403

Whoever I told this to never knew I was diagnosed with it and I never let it pass me as a disability. I try my best to be normal in terms of education. I do have low English test scores but my writing is good. Glad to hear that what the docs said about your condition and not being able to do such things turned out to be false.

2698964,0,t3_2qxxdy,grannyAs somebody who has been on this sub for a couple of years i have to comment. Many awesome people who used to be here all the time have left some have stopped frequenting this sub others have left Reddit etc. and different awesome people have arrived. This change in people has made the whole feel of the subreddit to change more than a few times. This is not the same subreddit that it was a year ago or two years ago and even in between those times and before that. Crazy shenanigans with the subreddit CSS fillies and the omnipresent sbstare butts bees PLounge Mafia the chats in Steam Skype and the like i faintly recall several PLounge gaming servers for TF and Minecraft the still ongoing twisquint controversy etc. Nostalgia for times past is inevitable in those who have known the PLounge in its many incarnations.Me being the nerd i am i see it exactly the same way as regenerations in Doctor Who. Yes it was great when some given Doctor was around but the next one was awesome in a different way and the successor in yet another one. Those who keep pinning for the ones gone miss out on the awesome happening right now. cutealoo So dont worry much about the PLounge that used to be enjoy the PLounge that is right now.,MLPLounge,cnav1fz,2,t5_2t403

2919186,0,t3_2tk80m,Id like for you to listen to this song especially the second verse. Done? If not go and watch it if yes continue. My parents are usually very forebering whenever I fuck up and rare is the case when and if they congratulate me on something personal. You end up feeling hollow inside as if nothing is worth doing. What is the point if its not going to bring anything? After the gravity of this sunk in I went into a deep state of just not caring. What I did for a lot of this time is go through days on autopilot waiting to die. It was a state of waiting for A end. I didnt care how it came I just wanted it all over. In this silence I started hearing things. I started to see patterns in actions I had done. I had found a new perspective. I found out that the world is large and by consecuence dosent give a shit about you. The world has excess of stuff and would much rather dumb as much as it can and see how it ends so if the world can stops you its better for it. And it got me there. I aint doing shit so I guess it won but the fact is that it never wins. It just tricks you into thinking it won. The world only wins when you die as long as you stand the world is your bitch. The thing that separates you from the world is that you can take immediate action on anything. What  you take from this is that its up to you to give a shit. If you had the chance to fuck up it means there was also a chance of success. You try long enough and you will eventually get it right and thats the key. Holding on. You need to motivate yourself because no matter how much they may drag you down you can outlast them. ,MLPLounge,cnzx4tz,2,t5_2t403

2955708,0,t1_co41d2e,ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspNineteen years ago relatively speakingampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspRain pelted the ground as the roar of thunder could be heard in the distance. Lightning flashed across the sky and lit the ground beneath it revealing a somber scene.ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspThe small form of an alien infant thrashed about in his metallic pod. The ground beneath and around the pod was completely void of life the nutrients from the soil and grass being absorbed through small tubes and sending information and sustenance to the tiny alien. ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspHis pod landed hours ago the noise of the storm covering up his descent and eventual crash. The primitive stone houses around remained silent through the affair.ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspAs lightning struck once more a horse neighed and trotted about uncomfortably. His whinings became louder and louder until it could no longer be ignored by its owner. ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspA lantern flickered to life barely visible through the frame of a window not far from the aliens current abode and a door quickly opened and shut as a man ran to his stable. He kept the lantern above and in front of his face held aloft by a long and sturdy stick.ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspAs the man approached the stable to calm down his horse he also heard the faint cries of what he assumed to be a child. Opting to put the child before the horse he simply yelled a command to the equine and tied it back to its post rather than go through the motions of calming such a creature down.ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspTurning his back to the stillwhining horse he briskly walked toward the sound of crying. As it grew louder he knew he was getting nearer. Stepping over a large stone he noticed that the ground beneath his feet no longer felt right. It wasnt the same squish he heard from the wet grass but more of a thud as if it were dry and void of life. The crying stopped.ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspBringing the lantern closer to the ground he examined the blackened soil. He turned around to see if there was more and he realized that what he stepped over was not a rock. The farmer had enough experience with metal to know that the shine it gave off with the light was that of a refined and worked ore.ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspHis curiosity took over all senses. He forgot about the crying the storm around him and the dead ground beneath his feet. Part of the metal was different. It seemed like he could see through it. He moved around it hoping to get a better view of whatever was inside.ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspWhat in the name of the Gods? he thought to himself as what was contained in the metal was before his eyes at last.ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspThe white creature stared up at him with large redtinted eyes. Its head was the shape of a football its body small and its extremities smaller still. It had a single antenna sticking up at an odd angle one the farmer assumed was unnatural as it bent so extremely.ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspHe stared for a few seconds more the alien staring back and lightning striking a nearby field brought him back to his senses. Feeling how close it was he turned toward where it should have hit. ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspThe crying started again. It was so close to him. Could it be..? He turned back to the strange creature and its mouth was wide open. Its crying...ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspThe farmer turned this way and that searching for where it could have come from. Seeing nothing to claim this thing as its own he made up his mind. Its just a baby. Ive got to help it.ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspSlowly bringing his free hand to the seethrough part of the metal box it reacted with a shine brighter than even his lantern. He shut his eyes as a tube shot up toward him and attached itself to his hand.ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspA shout escaped his lips as he dropped the lantern to the ground its glass breaking and the fire dying out on the moist ground. He grabbed the assailing tube and attempted to rip it from his palm. ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspAfter a few moments of frantic grunting and pulling the farmer was about to give up to whatever it was. ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspIt left his hand with a pop and retracted into the box. The creature stopped crying and a hiss emanated from the metal where he could see through.ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspA small amount of smoke rose into the air as the glass in front of the alien moved away. Rain fell on the infant and it began crying again.ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspHis fraternal instincts taking over the pain he ignored his aching palm and reached slowly through where the glass was blocking him before. Seeing no light this time he quickly grabbed the tiny alien in his large hands and brought it to his chest. Its crying continued as the rain unmercifully pelted its skin.ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspForgoing his doubts the man rushed back home with the strange creature still in his arms. He glanced back once at the strange metal box and the broken lantern in an attempt to write their whereabouts to memory.ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspThe alien acted as any human child would even curling up in the warm blankets of his spare bed. ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspSnoo came a quiet moan of comfort from the mass under the blankets. ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspSnoo eh? The farmer smiled softly. Well I guess thats what your name will be for now.ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspLeaving the room and returning outside with an extra coat on he returned to the site of the crash.ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspSpotting his downed lantern he picked up all the pieces he could and stuffed them in his extra coat which he flung over his shoulder. ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspTurning now to the metal box all signs of any tubes now gone he gripped the underside of it and attempted to lift it. ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspThe metal it was made of felt sturdy and wellforged but it was also very light. What kind of smith constructed such a container? he thought to himself.ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspHe lifted it onto his other shoulder and jogged back to his home.ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspHe dropped the remains of the lantern into a corner to deal with in the morning and he placed the metal box in the room with the nowsleeping creature.ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspThe man didnt sleep that night. Instead he sat on a chair and watched the strange infant sleep until the storm died and the sun rose.ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspThe questions he had in his mind he knew would probably never be answered. Even so the man had the feeling hed be taking care of this baby for a long time to come.ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspTo be continuedEdit Dont ask if youre not going to read it.

Not just romantic rejection but family and friends rejecting me and hating me.gtWhen was the last time you could say you felt true terror?Last March I thought that my parents were on the verge of finding out about my greatest secret I cant remember why exactly I thought that. I made plans to run away to a youth Center if they found out. I had tickets for the subway to get there detailed directions how to get there and a letter explaining the situation in  languages to give to the people there and about  cash. I have issues with paranoia and anxiety.gtAre you typically an individual who gets scared easily?Probably Im the guy that couldnt use the bathroom for two hours once because a Roomba scared me away.gtHow do you usually combat impractical fears such as the dark or nightterrors assuming you have experienced any?I used to be afraid of the dark. That just kind of went away on its own.gtDo you like scary movies books or games? Why or why not?Hell yes! I love horror movies stories and games.This might sound weird but in a way I like to be scared! Not shit like my family discovering my secret theres no fun in that. But like monsters and the supernatural. I LOOVE that stuff! I actually sometimes fantasize about what I would do in scary situations how I would make sure Id get out okay. The plot of Steven Kings the mist is one I use a lot even though it traumatized me as a kid. The fear I get from playing scary games and stuff and reading stories and things like that is kind of oddly exhilarating like an adrenaline rush just from thinking about this sort of thing.

Sometimes if Im just not okay in any sense my body language gives it away but thats only if Im on the verge of a breakdown.spbjsearch A lot of the time its less about bluffing to everyone else and more about convincing myself the bluff is true.  Most of the time my body language just doesnt show at least not enough for anyone around me to give a shit about it. My hat partially covers my eyes so people dont say that I look so tired or sad anymore and that was all I ever really had problems with in the first place anyways.If people can tell theres something wrong they dont give a shit and I suppose I have no reason to worry if thats the case anyways.  ,MLPLounge,co7n8jn,2,t5_2t403

3043633,0,t3_2uy930,Oh man wish I had seen this sooner I CAN HELP! celestiyayI experienced almost this exact situation like  years ago or so when I was in high school. My mom had to leave her job as an elementary school principal basically because the superintendent and her vice prinicpal were conspiring against her so she basically said fuck it Im out!We spent about a year and a half with severely reduced income before she decided to pursue becoming a college professor. She got a job at a nearby college but in order to keep the job needed to get a doctorate so for the first  years of the job her income basically went right back to the school to pay for her degree.The point is its not as scary as it sounds like its gonna be! Youll adjust to the lower income as a family and find a way to keep a similar style of life while making some small changes. Cheaper groceries less new clothes and stuff things like that. Obviously I dont know your exact financial situation but in my experience as long as your family makes strides to figure things out it wont have too severe an impact on your lives. Also based on your post it sounds like you are already in the right mindset to figure out how you can embrace the change rather than be damaged by it. Stay positive and good luck!,MLPLounge,codgzuy,2,t5_2t403

It is a fact today that one in ten thousand of us can make a technological breakthrough capable of supporting all the rest. The youth of today are absolutely right in recognizing this nonsense of earning a living. We keep inventing jobs because of this false idea that everybody has to be employed at some kind of drudgery because according to MalthusianDarwinian theory he must justify his right to exist. So we have inspectors of inspectors and people making instruments for inspectors to inspect inspectors. The true business of people should be to go back to school and think about whatever it was they were thinking about before somebody came along and told them they had to earn a living.ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampndashampnbspR.

They may kick puppies for giggles be particularly insensitive or might just be too unknowable to be anything but evil.Then there are villains who are Affably Evil. There is absolutely nothing separating them from being normal polite people except for the fact that they want to Take Over the World or use human souls to power their Artifact of Doom. Theyre not the Stepford Smiler  their affability is a genuine part of their personality not a mask. If they have underlings expect them to be a Benevolent Boss.

3414081,0,t3_2zb6zh,. Marche  Final Fantasy Tactics Advance This guy.  I dont even know where to start.  beware incoming spoilers of this game but if you havent beat this game by now chances are you never were going to.  So Marche and his friends were magically teleported to a Final Fantasy realm due to one of his friends wishes.  There he joined a clan and became super powerful and pretty popular with awesome spells and abilities and friends.  Meanwhile his friends got their wishes too one who was bound to a wheelchair could move again and introvert became the prince of the nation some random girl got her hair color of choice.  Whats not to love?  Well Marche sure wasnt having it.  He basically ruined all of his friends dreams and went about to destroy the fantasy world because he was homesick and this wasnt real.  Give me a break.  What a friend you are.. Emil  Tales of Symphonia Dawn of the New World  Onto the next guy.  So the original Tales was a great game.  Some people hated Collette but I kind of liked her.  Anyways.  Up comes this new game and this new main character.  Hes a whiny bitch with a bipolar disorder literally.  Like he has some other person who lives in him that appears when Emil gets annoyed enough.  Hes like  what was wrong with this game.  Ugh so much potential wasted.. Flim and Flam  They annoy me so freaking much.  People say Pinkie Pie annoys them.  I dont understand it but whatever people can have their opinions.  My opinion is that Flim and Flam is the most annoying group of characters in the show.  I hate their song I hate their personality I hate their attitude I hate their looks I hate everything about them.  In my opinion they deserve to take  points of fire damage  points of acid damage  points of electricity damage be poisoned to death turned to stone driven insane and then sent to another plane kudos to you if you know what spell this is.,MLPLounge,cphfhod,2,t5_2t403

As for the other ones Betelgeuse is  Light years away.  Far enough away that we wont be effected by the supernova.  The supernova is expected to go off anytime between now aaaannnd  million years.  The last time humans witnessed a supernova was the Crab Nebula Supernova n  AD.  It was so bright that scholars could write by the light it gave off.  Betelgeuse is expected to be even brighter.  The comets and Asteroids dont get anywhere close to us to worry about their perihelion closest approach to the sun is around the orbit of Neptune.  Additionally these supposed planets beyond Neptune are between  and  AU away from the sun.As for Pluto we sent a probe out to study the planet back in .  This is the first time we have ever sent out a probe specifically for studying Pluto and its orbiting companion Charon.  It will make its closest approach on July th this year.

4006764,0,t3_36ddv3,Hi! I studied Electrical Engineering and Software Engineering at Clarkson University so first off if you need tutoringacademic help feel free to shoot me a message!My biggest recommendation to anyone going to a college is one of personal bias but it also looks amazing on a resume Join Alpha Phi Omega.  It is a national coed service fraternity with  chapters in the US and almost  chapters worldwide.  They dont drink or maintain housing but they are still a Greek organization so you get the perks of being in a fraternity without the stigma of partying all the time.  I joined and it changed my life. The alumni network landed me an internship last summer and is certainly helping to make finding housing for my full time job I might be moving to CT easier.  As far as the specifics of studying engineering you probably wont be doing much computer specific stuff in your first year.  I recommend if you have free space in your schedule take some comp sciprogramming courses as a freshman it will give you an edge over others in your major.  I transferred to engineering school as a junior so I didnt have that opportunity I wish I did.  Are you interested in more of the hardware type stuff or the software? At Clarkson computer engineering was almost explicitly hardwareVHDL type stuff while software engineering did web design mobile apps etc.  Idk if thats how they break it down at other schools.  Its also okay if you dont have a specific point of interest narrowed down thats what college is for figuring that out. ,MLPLounge,crd02d2,2,t5_2t403

4120214,0,t3_37rwps,. Its freeopen source and I like the community aspect of it all. Ubuntu .. Nah.. na. I say Linux fewer letterssyllables. Not anymore. I used to think i was hotshit when I first started using it but Ive come to realize that it doesnt really matter. A lot of people hate on windows  but dont do anything about it. I encourage them to check out linux. They never do. I think they just like to complain.. I was using windows . I work from home over the internet so my computer has to work and be reliable. I hated the wonky settings where you touch the mousepad a certain way and it would change screens or display sidebars or whatever. Even after I turned those setting off it would still do it and it was infuriating. Then in the middle of the work day my comp just decides its going to install updates and that I cant do anything about it. So for  hours I just couldnt use the computer. I spent the rest of the day installing linux and ditching windows. I really like being in control of every little thing now its great.. There are some little quirky things that go on and they arent worth the time to resolve. For example one of my monitors always fails to turn on at startup. I just unplugreplug and it goes on. Not a big deal but I wish it didnt happen.. up time   day  minutes. My neck beard is only stubble right now but growing everyday I think.,MLPLounge,crpxh7p,2,t5_2t403

4202659,0,t3_38zjzy,In high school I always figured Id go into a biology or physicsrelated field because I always liked math and science. But I also liked art and looking back I honestly dont know why but halfway through my senior year of high school I decided that I wanted to go into Illustration?? Id taken two art classes in high school at that point haha. Anyway I got to college and started applying to the Illustration major got rejected my first time and then they changed the requirements of the major so I had to wait an extra year to apply. While I was waiting I took an introductory D animation class traditional pencilandpaper animation. I had legitimately honestly NEVER given animation a SINGLE thought. In high school I had decided that animation was nothing more than just learning computer programs and coding I didnt think about any of the artistry behind it. This college D class actually made me think of the arcs of movement and the principles of animation and it COMPLETELY blew my mind. So then I decided to apply to the Animation program instead got rejected once with a please apply again next year wed really like to see you back and got in my second try! I kind of already told you about this the other day but that time I spent waiting around for my real major was one of the best things that ever happened to me. I got to take so many different classes and the wait put me in the program at a really good time for me with classmates who have become some of my very best friends. If I could go back knowing what I know now Id do everything exactly the same.,MLPLounge,crzaltx,2,t5_2t403

4354558,0,t3_3aw1km,Its been an unproductive summer day but last night I did have one of those long movielike dreams that just doesnt end. Pearl from Steven Universe had a vision about certain doom. I was in GTA riding up cliff sides steeper than  degrees in a purple car while salesmen and hackers shot at me. I went to see a movie at the top of a set of very steep stairs but I was wearing pants without pockets so I didnt have money with me to buy blind bag ponies afterwards. The movie I saw was about two black men who went to that same movie theater in the year  one with a transparent pumpkin on his head. I was on a beach with a bunch of crabs that would stand on top of any object I told them to and when I told them to stand on top of a crab they made a giant crab tower. Finally Princess Cadance went through the Equestria Girls portal to find that some rebel crystal ponies had secretly gone through the portal to live as humans killing some of her royal guards with a pistol they found in the human world. The rebel ponies were trying to be peaceful and only shot the guards because they didnt know that bullets would kill them.,MLPLounge,csghp9c,2,t5_2t403

4529430,0,t3_3d33gq,Instructions for eggsandwich with Jalapenos. You need  egg  bacon  toastcheese  toasts and  jalapeno per sandwich and a bit of normal pepper and salt.. Cut the bacon as small as possible and put it with the egg into something where you can mix them. Cut the Jalapeno in small pieces but dont add them yet.. After mixing the bacon and egg good you add half of the Jalapeno to the egg. Put it in a pan. The difficult part You have to keep it roughly the shape and size of the toast. DO NOT TURN THE EGG! Turn down the heat instead.. When the egg is almost done put the rest of the jalapenos on it then salt and pepper as you like. Wait  seconds then apply the cheese and then the first toast.. Wait a few more minutes. When you can move the toast and the egg follows its done.. Turn it and then put another cheese on it then put the toast on the yet to be still toastfree side.. After a minute its done. Enjoy your egg sandwich.,MLPLounge,ct1kjjv,2,t5_2t403

4534699,0,t1_ct23toi,Last night Im crying my eyes out everything hurts and I want to die. I think Ill go to sleep to get away from it and I dream that Im drowning. I dream that Im trying to swim up to the surface but just cant get there in time. I wake up heart pounding tears in my eyes gasping for breath...  It was just a nightmare like every night. I know Ill be tired in the morning because of it because I always am but after a few minutes I manage to go back to sleep because I need to because Im already tired all the time without skipping sleep. I dream that I havent gone to school in weeks that I threw my life away and gave everything up. I dream that everyone hates me and I hate me too and I question how I let it get like this. I wake up from that to my brother and my cousins screaming playing some game but Im not going to bother them because theyre having fun. I wait for them to go. I brush my teeth and try not to cry seeing myself in the mirror because I look wrong. I hold back the tears and I go make a sandwitch. Im thinking I want to play guitar since Im pretty okay at guitar and singing is nice And Im tuning down my strings for a song and one snaps. I know I cant afford to buy a new string but I try not to let it hurt me. So I think this will be okay. Ill draw instead later. for now lets get my mind off it by going on the plounge. and I see this.I am trying. I am trying so fucking hard. I know it doesnt seem like it and Im sorry. Im sorry that Im a depressing mess but I am trying my hardest. Do you know what its like to try and stay optimistic just to get metaphorically kicked in the teeth at every turn? Do you know what its like to force yourself to sleep every night and deal with nightmares just to be exhausted every morning? Do you know what its like to feel so tired and horrible and sorry that everyone around you has to deal with you?Im trying...Im trying my fuckin best man....,MLPLounge,ct28cbu,3,t5_2t403

4652792,0,t1_ctgxw9e,Sorry for the delay. Had internet troubles.Heres a comment i made on it a while agoHope that goes well A couple of reasons One we really didnt share much in common. Actually we shared almost nothing in common. This made being together difficult over time and he felt sorta the same way too. The subject of our talking was just about our love nothing else so I got to thinking maybe that love just turned into infatuation instead.nd he was someone who worried quite a lot and too the extreme. He would use our relationship to cope with that which is good but thats all he did to cope with that it seemed. He never learned to deal with worry on his own and even with the relationship it want enough and that was a main point. I felt like I was holding that growth behind. He is me  after all so I felt breaking up would also be better for him in that way without the relationship holding him back.That worry it also got to me. Over time I got depressed by it. Id be constantly worrying about him and it might sound selfish but being with him was really becoming a bit of a burden with seeing no improvement in him. The final nail in that coffin was when one day he said he wouldnt know how to live without me that hed maybe resort to well suicide perhaps. That is what led me to question it all and also what held me off for more than a month on breaking up. He was also kind of immature my conversations with him didnt get far and in the end it made me feel that perhaps I was tolerating him as in I had to tolerate him and again I felt like I was holding him back in doing that.In the end I still loved him and do still now but being with him was bad for both of usThats not to say he wasnt a good person. He was and is. He took the break up bad at first and even now but I feel that hes improving and learning from this. And thats what I want him to take from it. To be s better person from it.Thats long,MLPLounge,cth1mft,3,t5_2t403

4893360,0,t3_3hx3c1,cchmmSort of depends on situation and what sort of media.I mean Ive bought multiple games after downloading them because I thought the games were good and wanted to support developers. In that use I think its a really good thing. However I dont think it hurts the companies much if people download it just to play it. Most likely they werent going to play it anyway. If its a good game most people will buy the next or the same game. But it comes back to that people who download games wouldnt pay for them anyway.For movies I feel like its sort of the same thing although maybe not as much. People who just watch movies online probably wouldnt pay for it anyway. And if it was good they may pay for a sequel. Then there are services like Netflix that I think helps out a lot. Overall I dont think it outright ruins stuff. In many cases Id imagine it actually helps. ,MLPLounge,cubcifj,3,t5_2t403

A game does not have to end. You cannot win Tetris only loose. You can keep going forever if your luck never runs out. As  and  fall out this is also not valid. No. Ever played I Spy?

5603284,0,t1_cwrmnm1,For the most part the dungeon types are as follows CaveDwemerBurial groundRuined FortressDragon Ruin... ?The DLCs do much better proving bethesda can and will make better stories but for some reason they are incredible at flubbing their main storyquest. FO the trainwreck ack. But the DLC all the DLC were ... okay Zeta was utter garbage and I hated it but point lookout? Good stuff. The Pitt? ...eh it was okay. And the one with the brotherhood you know man in FO the brotherhood was such a mess its not even worth commenting on other than that it was pretty cool seeing a bit of the past.And yeah okay I can get the no classes argument because skyrim having classes at all would be a detriment anyway. Theres no reason to do multiple playthroughs on different classes because the storylines are pretty bare anyway. At best you get the variation of physical character vs magic character. And the combat system still blows as much as morrowinds if not more due to the complete lack of builds of any kind.The puzzles in Skyrim are often just look at the statues on the wall... but one of them is broken!. Like the puzzle with looking at the dragon claw in the inventory is used for all dragon claws you use in the game and nothing else. Not to mention UI in skyrim somehow manages to be worse than oblivions! I mean its probably better on console controls but its still every shade of horrible.Speaking of consoles Skyrim was the worst botch job ever made on the ps and really put a huge dent in my faith in bethesda. Thankfully I picked the PC version but man those poor console users...I mean yeah its a solid  out of  so no problem there. Vast as a sea deep as a puddle. You never really feel invested in the place youre trying to save. At best you feel like the story will lead you to the cooler dungeons in the game but I never felt any sort of... emotional investment in any of the characters. Do I care about the thalmor? Do I care about the empire? The nord... guys..... uh.. whats their names....And the choices you are presented.... Empire good ThalmorNord supremacists  cartoon villains. You never see anything redeeming about the stormcloaks ever. Its just a really bad option! I mean some games let you be evil right but skyrims big choice is sensible vs complete jackassery. Or with the dragon and the blades... the only good natured dragon that has helped you countless times must die because the blades says so. Like yeah. Uh. How do they feel about my dragon summoning shouts then... ? Uff..Edit AND FOR A GAME... with such HYPED UP DRAGONS... they sure suck to fight... or even watching them.,MLPLounge,cwrn3ib,1,t5_2t403

5729697,0,t3_3tkgf6,I came up with just the answer to this before even reading this post. Today I was thinking about how some of my friends and family have taken to calling me fearless as of late.  Im not. Im the opposite of fearless. Fear is what inspires me more than anything. Even more than love.I fear death in fact not because I fear not being here but because I fear a waste of my life.  I have many small irrational fears  social anxieties driving on highways taking certain risks  but my biggest fear of all is that all these will keep me from living.  The fear of not living is far greater than my fear of anything else. What impact am I going to leave with my loved ones?  What memories will I leave behind?  Will I get to do everything I set out to do?  My mom has called me fearless several times in the past month alone because I am doing things like flying in an airplane or joining new fitness classes or going on dates things shed never have done at my age.  She thinks I am brave and that may be so but I am certainly not fearless. I do not lack fear.Fear is the reason I am still alive. ,MLPLounge,cx7bp43,2,t5_2t403

6479953,0,t1_czpk11j, Suzuki DRZ .  It sat in a barn for a few years.  Plastics oxidized frame rusted a bit back tire dry rotted varnish in the carburetor.Got it out last summer.  Boiled all the old gunky gas out of the carb and put a rebuild kit in it.  After that the engine ran perfectly.  Changed the oil and the back tire.  Stripped it down to the bare frame sanded down the frame and the plastics painted the plastics frame engine rims and exhaust with Rustoleum.  But the seals in the rear shock dry rotted so the rear shock is out and the paint is beginning to flake off.I figured since this bike can net about  in perfect condition  would be a fair asking price since it still needs some work.Also this is the picture I featured in the ad.

The thing is the GM loves to insert characters from other franchises into his campaigns. Heres the main character lineup the dude writing the session logs on the forum is the coach at the left and yes Kisekae is woefully inadequate for dudes hes supposed to be a tough war veteran recognize anyone? And as the campaign advances many other familiar faces appear too both good and bad. sptwitank Its been a thoroughly entertaining read although without knowing the background fluff of the wargame you guys may have more than a bit of trouble following it up and in the process they got me to watch Girls Und Panzer which is not a bad outcome at all.,MLPLounge,d1rxpvb,1,t5_2t403

Kiss normal conversations goodbye. You dont have to be unhappy alone. Might as well bring them along for the ride. Would it also stress you out too? Yes. Probably a lot.

You have no idea how many times Ive tried to say all of this to various people as both a mod and even when I was just a normal user. It always seems to fall on deaf ears though. rMLPLounge is not an alternative to therapy or talking to a trusted adult who can do so much more than type words that look nice to read. If anything thats just like drowning your sorrow with a shot of whiskey. Eventually you become addicted to the kind words and it becomes less about actually being supported and more about the momentary high you get when people send those words to you. If you are feeling depressed or have any signs that you may need help please go talk to someone in person that you trust. Someone who can do more than just offer kind typed words about how great you are. This place is most definitely a hugbox and as someone who has struggled and still does with almost debilitating depression I am frequently appealed by how many people here try to be a onestopshop and never tell people to actually get help with their issues instead of acting like digital kind words are all it takes.,MLPLounge,d4hfieo,12,t5_2t403

Moonlight Twinkle or something? I ended up here didnt I?Granted this was in early  so you could make the argument that anyone whod be interested would already have tried it out by now but still. Its never too late to get someone a new interest. Id say go for it people!awesomebandIve actually got someone interested in the show. A couple years ago in high school I was great friends with a guy I knew in Choir. Wed practice together pretty often in the morning too on the school pianos. I ended up learning This Day Aria well all but like the last  seconds of it. I still dont know those  seconds to be honest and he liked the sounds of it. I learned some other fanmade songs and he liked them too! I told him where they were from and got him to check out the show. Next thing I know hes looking at fanart too. I havent seen him since I graduated so Im not sure if hes still into the show but Im glad I could rope him in anyway!jaglad,MLPLounge,d4nesln,3,t5_2t403

Companies are pretty much expecting you to fork out a shit tone of money every year essentially. The sad part is a lot of consumers just let them and buy the latest and greates every year. Apple is one of the worst. Apple used to be about freedom to the point that they would ship  everything with an information packet on how to open it up and tinker with whats inside. After Wozniak left all of that changed. They literally charge you  to put in a different hard drive that costs about  more. People just dont seem to care or are so blinded by fanboyism that they will literally defend the company tooth and nail for their shady as fuck business practices. I wish I could MS is better but its not. They will gladly fuck over the consumer for a few cents.,MLPLounge,d4yqm91,2,t5_2t403

8233578,0,t3_4s5obv,I had a dream recently about going to my friends house to watch an episode of Steven Universe. The episode was called Gregs Room and it was a flashback episode about the days after Steven was born. On top of having to take care of baby Steven Greg was having a hard time coping with the loss of Rose Quartz so the Crystal Gems made a room for him in the temple. The room was a small green meadow with a little cabin and off to the side there was a grave for Rose. Greg thanked the Gems and after some quiet time in his room he was ready to move on with his life and raise Steven.On the topic of recurring elements in dreams there are a couple things that pop up a lot in my dreams. Large empty shopping malls often with movie theaters Stores that are dirty and very poorly stocked Shitty knockoff versions of things that I would otherwise very much enjoy like that one dream where I thought I found MLP LEGO sets but they were an off brand worse than Mega Blocks Getting early copies of a gamemovie Ive been looking forward to only for it to be terrible and disappointing IRL they usually turn out to be just as good as I had hoped they would be Long epic stories that crossover many shows and movies I like,MLPLounge,d56r47g,1,t5_2t403

8286020,0,t1_d5d8t5p,Yeah.I was somewhat referencing that video.Well that is also true if you want to go full Meta.We ourselves are not significant.Its what we do and what we bring into the world that is significant.Wether it art ideas or a literal generation.It is defiantly a cultural delusion that we are fundamentally important or even slightly notable in the universe.However the human race has made some serious advances out of what was nothing.That is not notable in comparison to the universe.Yet it is important in Human history.For humans are not defined by the universe.Humans define the Universe  and everything within it.Humans defined humans alongside the brain.And the brain is the most narcissistic thing in the entire universe.For the brain thinks that that brain is the most important things.However it isnt wrong. If its talking about self preservation.It seems that most animals of a higher intelligence tend to try to save themselves or save others if possible.But why?If they have no value in the big picture then why should they try?Because they DO have value. Just not to the universe.They have value in Potential and in Culture.,MLPLounge,d5db7qq,1,t5_2t403

The characters weve seen in EQG are reflections kinda like the mirrorpool reflections except that for those four their reflections are also their trapped souls.Everything that happens in the EQG universe isnt real but like the dream world in Magic Sheep it still matters in the real world.We know that Starswirl was a conjurer he belonged to a school of magic that deals in summoning and banishing objects or creatures into out of and across existences.  His most accomplished spell Twilight named amniomorphic.  Amnion is a Greek root with several different meanings throughout the history of the language.As a modern scientific root it refers to dryland reproduction of animals and the group of animals that reproduce that way mammals turtles scaly reptiles crocodilians birds  amniotes.  In Koine Greek it refers to the eggmembrane of these animals especially of mammals.  Somewhat more disturbing is the older meaning a bowl for catching the blood of a sacrificed lamb.I think the important thing is this amniotic eggs can develop in a relatively harsh environment.

9025760,0,t1_d7wql2r,iRacing has about  active members. The difference between it and something like Forza is that its a lot more realistic and you really cant play it with a pad. You really need a wheel and pedal set which makes iRacing and other sims like it somewhat exclusive because of the cost of entry. iRacing laser scans all tracks and they work extremely hard with the engineers of the cars in the game to make everything as realistic as possible. Do you mean in one go? About  hours. Doesnt feel anything like driving  hours on the road though. Every minute of it is exciting and the time flies by. ,MLPLounge,d7wr6ih,2,t5_2t403

9636327,0,t1_da0uthc,gtHow many times have you tried to contact him since? Once?Heres my advice open Skype or whatever you guys most use to communicate.Send him a message. Something simple like hey. Sending someone two messages without a response is not clingy. A dozen? Maybe.OH. MY. GOD. Maybe read this a few more timesBack to the main point I was told in the last thread to text him asking why he didnt respond. But thats honestly clingy and would make me feel worse because it would make me feel like Im begging for his attention when he doesnt need mine. If he wanted to talk to me he wouldnt have gone nearly three weeks without talking to me. If he is drifting away from me I shouldnt reel him back in by trying to start a conversation after I already tried. I am not very knowledgeable when it comes to Buddhism nor am I a Buddhist. But if Im not mistaken one of the principles of Buddhism is if its meant to be it will come back. And if its not meant to be it will drift away. Pretty much do not force anything to happen. And if I messaged him asking why he didnt respond to my last message that would be forcing something to happen when hes probably doing fine without me. I adamantly believe that whether it is a Buddhist principle or not which is why I am not going to attempt to start a conversation with him after I have already attempted.I typed up that whole paragraph just so people wouldnt say try to talk to him again. I dont know how many more times I am going to have to reiterate myself. I had to do this in the last thread as well and the first response is already making me feel like Im in the last thread. This is driving me insane. How many times do I have to say that I am not going to message him as I have already tried? And I have already given my reasoning in that paragraph. Why is it so difficult for such a simple concept to get into peoples heads?,MLPLounge,da0vk0f,-2,t5_2t403

10404112,0,t3_5ozkwo,gt.How long have you been a bronypegasister? Whats your age and gender? year old dudemanbro. And Ive been a part of the fandom since early .gt.What attracted you to this subculture?Actually nothing to begin with I was a bit of a hater before I watched the show. Once I actually watched it and realised I enjoyed it though it just felt natural to chat with people about it and see all the various works that they did. Start learning the injokes and all that good stuff.gt.What is important valuable and has meaning to you based on MLP?Like a lot of people that got into the fandom it came to me at a point in my life where I was very depressed verging on suicidal in fact and for whatever reason I think just having this singular point of unadulterated joy was enough. Even if it was only a small thing it was just relieving to have a show I could stick on and just feel happy for a while in spite of everything else.gt.How are the meet ups and events like? How do members treat each other?Unfortunately Ive only been to one mass brony meetup personally I really enjoyed it. There was a lot of silliness people were generally very nice though admittedly quite weird and awkward as well and ultimately it was just quite a fun time.gt.How do you treat outsiders?Hard to answer I mean outsiders are just basically everyone right? I treat them based on how they treat me mostly. If theyre civil Ill be civil if they arent Ill try be civil for a short while and if it persists Ill stop caring about the niceties.gt.What makes you differentsimilar to other fans of the show?Well Im a bit social awkward definitely all through my education years Ive ended up in the less popular circles of friends not that I mind that. I dont think Im all too different from anyone else though.,MLPLounge,dcndg1n,4,t5_2t403
