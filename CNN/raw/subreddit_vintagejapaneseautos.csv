2061187,0,t3_2ieqce,Is it a bad price for a running driving ? No.  But you need to know what you are getting into. The pictures show a decent amount of rust it could be worse than he lets on. Really get under the car and look for rot not just surface rust. Look for signs of body work like body filler. It has custom gauges and dash cluster so be prepared for a possible hack job and rats nest of wiring. Same for the radio.  Take it to a mechanic BEFORE you buy it. Make sure it is mechanically sound. ,vintagejapaneseautos,cl1tl7a,3,t5_2zlqr

3261659,0,t1_cozrs6j,They are for spot welds. It helps distribute the load across the area of the plate rather than at the seams of the plate. Helps a lot when using thinner material. If I had just used a thicker material youd likely see failure at the welds on the thinner material it is welded to. Most of the sheet metal work is  and  gauge thickness depending on its location and the stress it is seeing.,vintagejapaneseautos,cp02yza,1,t5_2zlqr

8253423,0,t1_d597vfk,How do you feel about the various US military units that incorporate this symbol in their insignias? And what about the  stripe version that has only ever been used by the JSDF? This is all pretty trivial some of the older universities have swastikas in them of course not the ones at  degrees so how is this any different given the age of the design?    Edit Follow up question what if I rotate this design  degrees? Does that make it okay?
