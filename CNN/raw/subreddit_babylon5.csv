3809322,0,t3_322uv1,Sorry for responding to a twoweekold post.As for what happens we can take some guess that the Rangers infiltrated various religious orders. JMS seemed to have a keen interest in monasticism as it was a recurring theme. The order of monks led by Brother Theo were said to originate from New Melleray Abbey which is a real OCSO monastery in Iowa commonly called Trappists. Europe was brought out of the dark ages in large part because of the technological innovations and work of monastic orders. Interestingly many historians posit that the industrial revolution would have happened a century earlier had Henry XIII not brought down a Cistercian monastery in England that had Europes first blast furnace. I would guess that JMS vision was that history was repeating itself with the monks being a force for gradually moving Earth back to an industrialized society and the Rangers helping them along.Behind the scenes that episode was thrown together very quickly. They basically didnt know they had a fifth season approved until after the Season  wrap party. In fact they got the cast to renew their contracts at the wrap party while everyone was drunk. The last episode of Season  was meant to be the Season  finale but now that they had a whole new season to do JMS threw together a script basically overnight and within a week they were filming it. A lot of the sets hadnt been put back up yet and cast members had schedule conflicts so they needed a plot that allowed them to deemphasize the usual characters and settings.,babylon5,cqqhrge,1,t5_2rhrd
