Really?Statistically he consistently finishes in the top half of starters in rating and yards sometimes the top third in an era with more hall of fame bound starting QBs than any other.  You could argue that the three best and  of the top  quarterbacks are all playing right now.  In his two Super Bowl runs he wasnt just reliable he was excellent.  If sprinkled in means four straight wins in the playoffs most teams would kill for a QB who could sprinkle those games in.Hes not Peyton where whatever team has him is going to be one of the best in the league but calling below average to average is not a fair assessment.  Average QBs dont succeed as franchise players or even starters in most cases.,sports,centdht,3,t5_2qgzy

114330,0,t1_cereh9k,What you call bullying is what Marines call policing your own. Its one thing getting yourself in trouble but when you get everyone of your friendsteam mates in trouble you stop fucking up real quick for various reasons. Either youll fix yourself because you dont want your friends to suffer for your mistakes or your friends will fix you so you dont fuck up anymore. Instead of allowing fuckups to continue fucking up team mates start managing the fuckup themselves policing your own so that they either learn or simply dont have the opportunity to fuck up because they are being micromanaged.I can only speak for the Corps but it lives on mass punishment without it the whole thing would be a shit show. Policing your own doesnt necessarily mean beating people or yelling at them but it sometimes comes to that in my experience both ends and I  can promise you that theyre both effective in fixing fuckups. Pain leads to discipline.Sure theres multiple ways to skin a cat but some are quicker and more effective than others.,sports,cerg6di,1,t5_2qgzy

118089,0,t1_cerurtq,Here is the full play and here is a similar oneUsually when the other team dumps the puck into your end as a goalie you go behind to stop it to make it easier for the defenceman to come in and pick up and play. Starting behind the net leaves the defence with more options than if the puck was in the corner. However every once in a while the puck hits a stanchion which is basically the thing between the panes of glass holding them together. If the puck gets up to the glass it can hit and deflect off of the stanchion resulting in a puck going right into the net or an easy goal for the opposition.,sports,cervmmb,3,t5_2qgzy

141795,0,t1_ceuk5bq,Hey if you want to defend the behavior of atheletes be my guest. We have different values I value people. You value money and all the advantages that come along with it. Thats fine. We need greedy people like you in this world. You guys make it fun. Youre easy to manipulate due to your lust for money. Edit I think you overestimate how free football players are as well as how much money they make. Did you see what happened to Bowmans leg? All football players do is work and stay in shape. Its a hard life. Many of them due to financial irresponsibility end up broke after they retire. No money and a broken body. Sherman needs to be a little more humble. That action made me turn off the TV. He isnt Muhammed Ali. He has not shaken the world. He needs to calm down. Unless the NFL is about to start playing WWE type storylines theres no place for that kind of awkwardness in the league. No one even knew what the hell he was talking about. Erin was confused.

144262,0,t1_ceukwxh,I completely agree with you that shit talking shouldnt be looked down upon however in the past athletes shit talk to leading up to and during a competition. But when the match is done you tell the other guy hey good match i know we had our spats but good game and hope to do it again soon. Right after the game on Sunday I remember hearing a report i dont recall exactly who from but I think Crabtree himself saying that Sherman basically said hey good game but im better than you. You dont say that to a person who youve already beat on the field and just had everything theyve worked for for almost six months disintegrate. And yes the ass slapping thing is common in American sports but not in the way Sherman did it. It was condescending. Usually its a hey good play gesture. When put into the context of last nights game its a very offensive thing to do. Also this probably isnt too popular of an opinion but in our society athletes are as valuable as diamonds in the sense that they only have value when we the viewing crowd say they do. So yes we have some say when we decide if a person is deserving of their status. So while it may seem strange that we sit on our computer chairs and reign judgement we are the people that the NFL is trying to please. Therefore in a way it does matter how a player conducts himself.        ,sports,ceuv22g,1,t5_2qgzy

302133,0,t1_cfc1rbu,Yes. Canadian football is played on a  yard long  yard wide field with  yard end zones and goalposts on the goal line.  There are  downs and  players aside on the field. The extra player is typically a receiver on offence and a defensive back on defence. The defensive line must line up one yard off the line of scrimmage. The offence is permitted much more backfieldpresnap motion than American football. There is no fair catch rule. Canadian football uses a  second play clock. In Canadian football it is possible to score a single point in situations other than just a PAT. ,sports,cfc2yvg,2,t5_2qgzy

354418,0,t3_1y4s9d,Tretiakov has the fastest push in the world and he owns the start record on every track hes ever raced on. In some races Martins Dukurs comes close to matching Trets start times but Tret is an absolute start monster. His track record and consistent performance here is not unusual.Comparing his start times at the Sochi games to those from the Sochi World Cup last year is not proof of cheating. Differences in ice conditions easily cause a .. or . variation in start times. Sticky ice frosty ice light snow heavy snow all of them slow down the start. I do not remember the ice conditions at last years Sochi World Cup but ice conditions at the Sochi Games have been near optimal track records in most if not all sliding sports.Also home track advantage is HUGE. Look at Canadian John Montgomery winning Skeleton Gold at the Vancouver Games. He amassed heaps of runs prior to the Games way more than any of his competitors. This is smart and any nation will shoot to maximize home track advantage.Yes Martins Dukurs is a near invincible Skeleton god. His winning streak over the last five or so years is unmatched in nearly any sport he won  of  World Cup events. But hes been beaten. Matt Antoine USA beat him in the Lake Placid World Cup this season USA home track advantage and he was beaten in one other race this season I dont remember if it was Tretiakov or Rommel. Anyway Trets victory was by a margin similar to what Dukurs usually wins by. Dukurs has the nd fastest start in the world and is consistently the best slider in the world and thats why he dominates. Tret has the worlds fastest start. Pair the worlds fastest start with home track advantage training and its not surprising that Tret comes away with the gold.On the note of ice warming ice conditions throughout a race change due to shifts in weather temphumidity and the number of runs usually the ice slows down as more sliders go but this isnt always the case. The claims that the Russians adjusted the track refrigeration system to affect later sliders is rubbish. There is a huge lag time in the system a milelong refrigerator does not changes temps instantaneously. More importantly in the final heat of sliding events the top sliders go last I dont remember Trets start position in run  but he was first off in run  first off in run  and last off in run . The Russians cant make the ice slow for every single slider and then for the very last slider flip a magic heat track now button for the top place finisher.

717145,0,t1_cglovjj,Rugby Could refer to either Rubgy Union or Rugby League which in itself are two seperate but similar sports. Similar to NFL points are scored by running the ball across a line at either end of a rectangular field but there is no forward passing. Much less stop start than NFL. Started in England and played commonly in Australia as well as the rest of the UK and Ireland France Italy RSA NZ the Pacific and Argentina. Australian Rules Football also called Aussie Rules or AFL which is the main professional league developed completely seperate to Rugby i think even earlier? in Melbourne Australia. Played on a circular or oval field scores are made by kicking punting the ball between two vertical posts at either end ball cannot be carried across. Ball can only be passed by kicking the ball or hand passing hitting it with a closed fist when held in the opposite hand. Except for when the game is started there are no set positions for the players and there is no offside or limits on direction of passing. Game is essentially continuous play generally free flowing fast paced and full contact.  Aussie Rules is played professionally only in Australia. ,sports,cglsjr0,2,t5_2qgzy

However theres some truth to it in the sense that an umpire will be less sure of the balls trajectory and location if the catcher doesnt come up with it cleanly. There have been many studies in pitch framing that that show that a catcher that exhibits less movement while catching will get more called strikes. However there is no rule that says its a ball and not a strike if dropped.In this case the umpire was unsure and blew a call.,sports,cgmntjq,2,t5_2qgzy

FIFA is the most inclusive sports organization in the world bar none. Kosovo is not a member for very obvious reasons. Not sure if youre familiar with their history but basically they had more important things to worry about. They werent apart of fifa because they didnt make it a priority. Not because FIFA excluded them from it.All of the territories mentioned are allowed in but they didnt make it a priority. If someone from Northern Cyprus wants to be represented internationally they play for cyprus.

These arent players that arent quite good enough for the NFL AFLers are that and they didnt just hang it up and get a regular job.  The AFL pays about k to k per season for the regular players.  The average is k but thats skewed by a handful of players getting paid the bulk of the money.  Its not hard to make k a year if you graduated from college.

They would typically fall and think the next time they pushed in the post. There are ways to discourage pushing rather than completely faking a foul and celebrating it.

Although no one is asking for my opinion I dont think ray rice deserves a longer suspension because new evidence has since surfaced. It was known that he struck her with his hand. The video is new the facts are still the same. Goodell made a tough decision with the information at hand. Thats what hes paid to do. He later admitted he got it wrong thats fine.

Hopefully you see that your job had a hand in this problem.  And by them firing you they are claiming zero liability.  Thats the elephant in the room. If you read carefully youll notice I stated his actions were indefensible and that I didnt write a justification for him hitting his wife.   Explanation and justification are not equal in this conversation.

1888250,0,t3_2g8ew8,I think this needs to be said and I know a lot of people will disagree but theyre wrong and let me tell you why.Hitting your child is not an acceptable punishment. There are effective methods of discipline that dont involve striking a child. Whether or not it legally qualifies as child abuse doesnt matter. Whether or not you leave visible marks and bruises doesnt matter. When you hit your child you may think youre teaching them to respect you. While this may be true they learn to respect you out of fear rather than love. No child should live in fear of their parents. Parents should be nurturing and loving. For those of you that were hit as children and say Well I was disciplined and I turned out fine. You are the ones who will continue the cycle of child abuse. People need to realize that this is wrong in any degree. It causes the child to internalize their fear and project it onto their own children when they become parents. If you were abused as a child Im sorry. While your parents might be loving and perfect in every other way they were wrong in this regard. If you fail to realize this your children or future children may face the same abuse. Stop hitting your kids. Bruises heal but the mental damages are far more lasting and detrimental.,sports,ckgq57i,11,t5_2qgzy

Acting as coach andor general manager you buy and trade players work out your lineup bring rookies through your youth system and give instructions to your men during the game who go and hopefully do your bidding.In the games you choose when to bring in your reliever or closer tell your batters whether to bat normally bunt or swing for the stands. Youll tell your runners whether to stay where they are or make a dive to another base move your fielders out or in and tell your pitcher whether to go for the strikeout to pitch around or even just to throw one right at the batter and shake him up a little bit.The graphics and sound are where OOTP  is at its weakest. Most of the game takes the form of spreadsheets and tables full of statistics from which you can make your decisions.  The actual games arent much better. While D environments are new to this years version there are no moving crowds or batters running around bases. Instead a stationary layout with text boxes and pictures representing the players replaces the immersive environments found in other baseball games. There are some crowd noises but they are gratingly repetitive and will force most gamers to turn them off in no time.Its also a game that at first glance seems overwhelming. If you are a baseball junkie comfortable with ERAs SLGs OBPs and how to flip players between your man and man rosters then you may be able to catch on quickly but if you are only a casual fan expect a lot of learning to figure out what you are supposed to do. You can also expect to make a lot of mistakes.However the game creators are smart in allowing you to customize exactly how involved you want to be. So if you just want to deal with trades and purchases and leave lineups and managing games to the computer you can. Or if you want to go all in and change everything that option is also available too.As a casual fan myself in my first few hours I really was pining for the pickupandplay glitz and glamor of MLB  The Show. Yet as I played more frequently researching things online and moving very carefully things started to click and OOTP  hooked me in.OOTP  is a much slower game requiring you to think things through plan strategy and mull carefully over your picks. Even when I was away from my computer I found that I would still be thinking about my Yankees whether the trade proposed by the Red Sox for my third baseman would be worth it if I had enough coverage on my roster whether I needed a better reliever or if I should put my faith in the rookie I brought in.It also made the victories in games more satisfying because they all felt like my victories that I had won by employing a smarter strategy and using players that I had agonized over bringing into the team.Another of OOTPs great strengths is its depth in terms of options. Not only can you play in any of the minor leagues you can also manage teams in international leagues too such as the Japanese leagues. Finally the game opens the rosters up back to . Want to see if Babe Ruths Yankees would be better under your management or go back in time and manage the Philadelphia Athletics? Those options are all available to you amid the host of customization options on offer.Yet the audience for OOTP  is ultimately a particular one. OOTP  is not a game for a quick fix or a fast experience. If you are a casual gamer its hard not to recommend MLB  The Show over the slow churn of Out of the Park Baseball . But if you are a baseball fanatic or a statistician looking for a game to really sink your teeth into perhaps as something to play with the nightly baseball game on in the background then look past the bland spreadsheets. OOTP  might just be the dream ticket. ,sports,cl4iiuj,1,t5_2qgzy

2092804,0,t1_cl5rqtf,First of all Im not sure thats completely true. Scholarships can cover things other than tuition. Often they do so by simply estimating the cost and then cutting the student a check for that amount. So for example maybe a scholarship covers housing. If a student lives in the dorms that means they dont have to pay but if they live off campus it might mean giving the student a certain amount each month to cover their rent. If they pay less than that amount in rent they keep the difference.Secondly that doesnt mean that theyre not compensated. Nonmonetary compensation is still compensation.Third money is fungible so if the scholarship pays for some things the athletes would have otherwise had to buy for themselves like food and clothing it frees up that money for them to spend on whatever they want. ,sports,cl5ub0x,1,t5_2qgzy

2124318,0,t3_2j9ojb,I dont know much about the NRL or rugby in general but Id say my understanding is better than most Americans.  I know Lawrence Okoye wanted to come test the NFL but so far he hasnt done much.  The ers are my team and Ive seen Lawrence playing in preseason and in practice quite a bit and he is a great athletic specimen but US football is an incredibly complex game that can take a lifetime to understand completely.  I am assuming that this guy is probably a bit less athletically talented than Okoye and probably a bit more savvy about the game in general but I feel like what he is trying to do is going to be real tough.  Hell probably need at least a full season and probably two on a practice squad before he would be remotely ready to make a roster and have any meaningful playing time let alone becoming a starter.  The fear I would have with that is that at  he is looking at  before ever really getting into the league.  That is pretty late to be making an NFL debut.  Sure its been done before but almost always by either kickers or quarterbacks.Good luck to him maybe he can join Okoye on our practice squad and we can keep up the international theme.,sports,cl9uihu,6,t5_2qgzy

2200824,0,t1_cljiutv,Now I dont have experience in this area but I also wonder whether these types of campaigns could have long term inoculationlike effects. That is does watching these ads make it less likely that a young sports fan would grow up to be an abuser? Or to be abused?And I also wonder whether the type of campaign matters. You mention that campaigns are effective at informing the public that resources exist. What about campaigns that seek to increase awareness of criminal penalties antilittering proseatbelt antidrunkdriving ads tend to follow this model?And we do see attitudinal shifts over time in all sorts of areas. Im not naive enough to think that these shifts come from PSAs but what causes these attitudes to tip? The use of spanking seems to be far less socially acceptable today than it was when I was a kid in the s. Seat belt and helmet use seems to have shifted during my lifetime as well. Smoking is far less socially acceptable than it was before. Breast feeding is more prevalent today than it was  years ago. So if youre a policymaker hoping for an attitudinal shift against controlling or other abusive relationship behaviors what policy levers are available if PSAs arent effective?,sports,cljkujg,0,t5_2qgzy

The pro football hall of fame on the other hand is SUPPOSED to cover all forms of professional football and other leagues.  Although it is criticized for being too NFL centric.

That was Jordans biggest shortcoming before he got someone Pippin he felt he could trust and it still took several years for them to really gel.

Im only really thinking of the very high round draft picks out of college like a toptier Junior or Senior WR vs top corners or top Olinemen vs top Dlinemen. I think that there are a small group of players every year who go from CFB to the NFL who would be at the top of the game in the CFL and might occasionally find better matchups against one another than they could find playing in the CFL.The flip side is that college teams schedule a lot of fluff where the matchups are almost certainly worse but I think there is a lot of public opinion  draft value in a bigbrand college player beating another top prospect that cant be had against CFL players. ,sports,cngdw5y,0,t5_2qgzy

The ball clearly hits the ground pops out then he gains control. He needed to maintain control through original catch. Edit Unbiased Bengals fan. Edit  A response to a few comments There was no football move to differentiate the catch from a leap for the end zone. It was one fluid motion. Whether his knee or elbow was down to end the play before the ball popped out makes no difference. Bryant needed to maintain control through the whole catch. Sorry guys but this play was correctly overturned. The question is whether or not the Calvin Johnson rule needs to change. Edit  Gold? That was unexpected. Thank you!

2796299,0,t3_2s3fvh,If he was truly making a football move and going for the end zone he would have continued to hold the ball out in front of him not tuck it in an attempt to maintain control with all that momentum and slide on the ground across the goal line.

2897562,0,t1_cnw20zl,I didnt explain myself clearly. I was referring to the hysteria in some rugby and league circles that small creative playmakers are dying out and the game is becoming a meathead hitupathon. One of the reasons that creative ball players is dying out its said is that a lot of parents dont want their little Johnny playing against  year old Islanders who are double the size. Thats the latest example I can find of something similar admittedly league and admittedly no mention of islanders but when you get people talking about small creative playmakers who traditionally are almost always white dying out because of the size factor in league you dont have to look between the lines too much. Some even want weight divisions at youth level because of the issue. Basically Im saying its bullshit to say that NFL has no creativity when a lot of well respected people in rugby circles feel rugby has been heading the same way for a long time. ,sports,cnxghpt,1,t5_2qgzy

So they started letting air out of the ball and then Brady could again perform. Do we know this is what happened? No. Do we know this didnt happen? No. As for the the Saints rewarding their defense that wasnt Brees. That was the defense and the defensive coordinator and the head coach. Was it cheating?

Because this was done so close to when the footballs were tested they came in at higher than what they would be after reaching equillibrium later.  The Patriots requested the refs to set the footballs at . psi.  Once the footballs were allowed to reach their normal state at a certain time later I cant tell you exactly how long it would take probably  min the psi would be much lower Belichick estimated  psi.Now your question is a good one and should be answered but there is incomplete information.  It is not known what the Colts set their pressure to it is not known how they prepare their footballs and it is not known when they prepared their footballs.  If they prepared their footballs similar to the Patriots but did it an hour earlier than their footballs would have reached equilibrium before being tested not resulting in the same drop in psi as the Patriots.,sports,co0uq19,1,t5_2qgzy

You take certain risks when you play it.  Its part of the game until helmet technology gets better or they eliminate head contact at all which the latter is unlikely because its hard to regulate or remove as it is a crucial part of the game.

3158539,0,t1_cop6nfx,I do concur on your viewpoint that the Lions need something with their design. The Honolulu Blue and Silver colors are great but they could do something else something untried something better.Yet the last tweak that they did to the uniforms came while Matt Millen was the GM. He brought out an interesting Black version of the shirt and added Black to the color scheme. On the sole basis of having being proposed and enacted by Millen I despise the black accents to the Detroit Lions uniform. No black accents should be allowed whatsoever. Thats what    will do to you. As an aside in Detroit we seem to like the throwback uniform we used for the th Anniversary celebration. The silver helmet with no logo nor dividing line a simple electric blue shirt  with silver numbers and no accents nor arm stripes and a plain silver pair of pants and white socks. Silly enough that uniform was worn during a Monday Night game against Dallas. Thank you for your interest in the Lions uniform CitrusCBR. I always thought it was interesting that the shades of silver that both Detroit and Dallas use in their helmets are different.Take care Sir.,sports,copdpgb,1,t5_2qgzy

If you watch the video you posted there are several times where my go to move would be to go after that leg but it isnt there.  The legless gent also has trained like this everyday.  Hes know what hes getting into the other guy doesnt.  Plus imagine all the muscle in that nonexistent leg getting transferred to his upper body.  Wrestling is about controlling your opponent assessing their strengths and weaknesses and using them to your advantage.  If I had one leg but a strong upper body I would try to keep my opponent close and squared with me and use my upper body advantage to my advantage so as to hide my one leg which is what he does in the video.  If I was wrestling a dude with one leg Id recognize this and keep him far away and try to circle around him.  ,sports,cpco1ph,4,t5_2qgzy

Its gotten away from the way it is in international style wrestling where the ref physically holds the losing wrestlers hand down and keeps him in the circle. I dont mean to be a pain in the butt or come across as a dick but I wanted to comment on your word choice in saying its disrespectful. Nothing he did was disrespectful. There isnt a fan in the stands that would say he did anything disrespectful not a coach or official in the tournament that would say that it was disrespectful and certainly not a D wrestler who would say it was disrespectful and so to describe it as disrespectful on here is silly. Im a former D wrestler myself and I try to be as biased against Iowa as I possibly can but to accuse Gilman here of doing anything disrespectful and accuse might be a strong word the majority of your post was actually defending him is downright silly talk. ,sports,cpn4fu3,2,t5_2qgzy

3580648,0,t1_cq0e2tg,gt  I used to be like you I really wanted to believe that ancient mystical arts practiced in the hidden monasteries of China had unlocked all the secrets to kicking ass.Theres no ancient mysteries homie. Im not sitting around talking about my chi and ringing bells. Thanks for creating a narrative that doesnt exist though.If you want to discount kung fu you have to discount karate judo jujitsu and bjj too because everything they do is included in Shaolin curriculum and then some.Also... youre standing here telling me Bruce Lee would get his ass handed to him? Get over yourself.Its never really even been about the specific style its about HOW MANY REPS YOU PUT INTO YOUR PRACTICE. Kung fus only real benefit over anything else is that all effective techniques are somewhere in there to learn and that theyve really tested the techniques  ya know during that time when they would have their heads literally cut off if they were caught practicing it and it survived intact.Other than those two tiny things I dont give kung fu any special consideration over other styles. Its ALL about who puts in the most reps.gt If shaolin is so effective why does taking away eye gouges and groin strikes remove all effectiveness?If guns are so effective why does using a rubber bullet remove all effectiveness?Because youre restricting the primary focus of the style when you do so. Were not in it to punch and kick for round after round  were in it to end the fight immediately. Taking away every tool we have for that basically results in us standing there deflecting everything until we can take a good shot. Long story short  itd be boring to watch.Also If you pay attention Mr. TKD over there literally doesnt touch him meanwhile hes kind enough to pull his kicks. Thats an actual monk btw. Since youre so concerned about someone stepping up there you go. He owned the TKD dude.gt a highly ineffective and low percentage strikeIf you cant see you cant fight  and since when was this VATS? Low percentage? Give me a break...gt striking groins another hard to hit strike that often can be ignored by the opponent in the heat of battleEvery spot on an opponent is hard to hit and can be ignored in the heat of battle.gt And all that is to say nothing of this entirely unsupported notion that Shaolin can grapple anywhere near as well as active practitioners of the elite grappling arts or strike as well as practitioners of the elite striking arts.Legs of the north hands of the south.We dont typically focus on grappling though some do. Again  every technique in BJJ is in Shaolin. A BJJ is gonna do shitty when they cant grapple because they dont focus on kicks for instance. Im not sure why youre having difficulty recognizing that a style which focuses on deflectionandretaliation probably isnt going to focus on grappling. FYI  we do focus on not being grappled in the first place.gt Lets be real if Shaolin was as effective as its made to be youd get AT LEAST one ambitious practitioner who could make a killing in the ring. Aside from the restrictions against most techniques aside from the religious prohibition aside from the fact that its for selfdefense... thats still a shitty argument.MY ENTIRE FUCKING POINT HERE has been that MMAUFC is not a sufficient metric by which to determine if a style is effective. Literally cannot say it any other way  just because someone hasnt gone to MMAUFC to fight v in no way makes something invalidated. The logical fallacy youre committing to say so literally hurts my brain.Please if you think its all mystical bullshit and ineffective nonsense by all means go to any of the  Shaolin monks currently in the US or one of the many in other countries and tell them how their kung fu is mystical bullshit and that youll wipe the floor with them with your BJJ because no one goes to MMA w Shaolin.Im fairly certain youll change your tune when facetoface with this man.When he first opened his temple in NYC a bunch of other martial arts instructors from around the city got upset and confronted him in his kwoon telling him he needed to close his school and stop stealing their students ya know because people totally flock to bullshido when theyre learning something legit  or so you seem to think.He posted up and challenged them Ok.

3587268,0,t1_cq0064m,Im a bit worried about it. This is the first woman in a male dominated field the sexist jokes should be withheld until at least the second one. In a field like this it must have been really hard for her to be taken seriously and work her way up so far. Thats why it seems kind of fucked up to immediately mock her for her gender. Im someone who can take a joke  but if I were in her position I would not be very pleased at all.Not to be an SJW but this totally is demeaning. The whole issue with longstanding misogyny was that women have always been dismissed as incapable whiny irrational creatures and that is exactly the sentiment that this tweet perpetuates. Its the same shit as having a black man make it to some government office in more racist times and making some joke about how he wont be able to articulate himself and wont get anything done except subsidize watermelon farming.Im all for tasteless jokes believe me racist sexist and otherwise... But at the right time with the right audience. This just made me kind of sad. Had I just heard this in the company of friends I wouldve totally laughed guiltless. But the fact that this is in front of a global audience and seemingly the most famous response at this point... Its not horrible but its a little shitty.but go ahead call me an sjw,sports,cq16d4a,1,t5_2qgzy

3897089,0,t1_cr0hew1,Yes for the casual fan those names may not pop out.  But for fans who follow boxing a little more there is a lot of talent out there.  But  fight doesnt make a sport.  People want to see knockouts and when we didnt get it from Pacquiaos lack of performance many people were turned off.  And since we were baited for so long for this fight the hype was so large and then it didnt deliver the hype it had people were turned off again.  The popularity of other sports and the way they are marketed such as the UFC where there are a lot of knockouts are just what people want.  So if we dont get those crazy knockouts and being hyped for  years for nothing it turns people off.  I would say in the United States people are going to be turned off.  But boxing is also an international sport.  In Mexico people are still fans Russians are still fans and surely there are some people in America who are still fans.  So to say that this  fight lost the general publics eyes thats probably true.  But saying that  fight killed boxing we dont give enough credit to the international scene and the efforts of other sports marketing strategies.  ,sports,cr0i3ab,0,t5_2qgzy

He drastically changes his line at least twice unpromted by tags. When his helmet pops off he takes at least two steps toward the outfield which should have been an immediate out. Shortly after that hes about  steps toward the plate from where he just was. If this kind of stuff was legal and intentional baseball would be a way different game. ,sports,crjq1lw,1,t5_2qgzy

Him being to do that also gives a lot of weapons when he is running by doing tricks in full speed and ability to change direction many times in seconds.There are tens of nuances in his game also like explosive nature of his game his balance is next to nothing. His extremely fast release of ball surprises goal keepers time after time and his free kicks are sharp shoot accuracy. On top of all that he possibly has the best sport IQ of any other player in the sport and best passing seen ever before. He is just not record goal scorer he is a midfield player that builds Barcas game from lower.

Things like the Little League World Series which are more wholesome and probably deserving stories that need to be told perhaps not on the insane level ESPN goes to but which generate paltry interest compared to Tim Tebow being worked out by Chip Kelly. I guess its hard to pinpoint whos responsible for the hubbub especially since its likely a positive feedback loop.And yeah Costas was being bashed for being some talking head liberal but hes a pretty wellrespected journalist who generally has nuanced and well thought out positions that reflect his genuine beliefs.,sports,cs2n1iu,1,t5_2qgzy

I agree that hes an amazing player possibly the best ever but they media should suck his dick a little less often so people can just enjoy watching him be badass. He honestly seems like one of the nicer NBA players who is crazy good similar to Curry who I think is THE nicest all star player. He just gets too much credit and players like Kyrie and Love get completely forgotten. If you watch highlights or big stories on the cavs the only time those players are mentioned is if they were injured and Lebron was able to carry the team to a win.

If you lead with your head you just really have to make sure you dont lower your head and hit with the crown of your helmet. Thats when you really start risking a neck injury. You see a lot of injuries on kickoffs because players are running so fast when they collide for a block or tackle. At that point you pretty much just lower a shoulder pad and try to to destroy somebody. Definitely a lot of fun also. ,sports,cskko6d,1,t5_2qgzy

Of course machines contained sensitive mechanisms to shut down if the tilt was too severe.

4557374,0,t1_ct52dmg,Ok well heres a protip for the next time this comes up in your life.You obviously dont care. Your friend wanted you to care. A lot of people dont care and a lot of people actively do the opposite of caring.Your friend saw you as a friend and wanted you to care. When he was talking about societys problems he was using them to talk about his own.Now your friend was talking to you. Caitlin Jenner was giving a speech televised to millions. There is a difference here that is fundamental.Caitlin was asking you as a member of society to be cognizant of LGBT issues. Your friend was asking you to be cognizant of his issues.You didnt treat your friend any differently but he wanted you to. Not because he was gay but because he was upset about some shit and needed a friend.Which brings us all back around to Caitlin Jenner who did nothing more than ask for people to embrace differences and to do that through compassion.Part of compassion is understanding and part of understanding is recognizing that sometimes people are bad at communication.Obviously you either need to learn a bit about that or Battlefield was more important than your friendship.Im not insinuating that youre the problem. Im just saying that perhaps youre metrics for compassion are a little flat so perhaps you should brush up on that before injecting yourself into the debate.In other words your not helpful but youre not harmful either. So you got that going for you. Hope your friend found people able to give a shit. Never did find out what happened to those  remaining tickets in Battlefield though. ,sports,ct52rq5,0,t5_2qgzy

4557785,0,t1_ct541lb,Genders a confusing topic. Its important to make the distinction that your sex is biological while gender is a social construct. For example lets say men are expected to be the breadwinner. Achieving this would likely become important to reenforcing your identity as male. Now most societies break gender into male and female. Each category would have a number of characteristics. Being transgendered would mean you identify more with the characteristics of say female despite being biologically male and vice versa. Now gender can get much more complex when we start talking about it on a continum rather than just in male and female terms.One last important thing to remember is that someone can be transgendered without undergoing a sex change. While some people feel its neccessary to be their true self others consider themselves transgender without ever changing their sex.Anyway hope this makes sense.

I really think the Cards were last seasons lucky team meaning more onfield breaks went their way than not obviously not injuries but lucky in regard to what happens on the field. Also the reason people say Arians is so great that his team stumbled into the playoffs with a thirdstring quarterback is actually part of the reason why I think he and his team are hard to actually judge so far. I think they overperformed the entire season and it wasnt because of Arians. I also think when everyones healthy next season we will have a better idea of what a Bruce Arians Cards team really looks like.,sports,ctiyf33,2,t5_2qgzy

4713617,0,t1_ctonjmc,Youre right in a lot of ways but I dont think it would be a blowout unless she couldnt get him off his feet. In my head this is an untrained Mayweather. His art is boxing he doesnt have a background in fighting on the ground theres no  week training camp for the fight. I think lbs would be the fairest weight for them both. Ive seen a few vids with Rousey grappling men but they were always obviously bigger guys who also did MMA that wouldnt be the case if they were the same weight and untrained. A lot of the skills that Mayweather has perfected over his career would be negated. Rousey wouldnt be punching because he can deal with that easily. He cant just backstep forever because he could be tackled. His expert clinching cant defend against hip throws. He would rely entirely on his brute strength once the gap is closed and if theyre the same weight I dont think hed be ridiculously unquestionably stronger than her. Especially when his body is unaccustomed to and untrained for ground fighting.Honestly I dont think the backlask to my comments is because men are Afraid of what women can do but I do think its sort of a Ill believe it when I see it mentality which Im fine with. It took me awhile to come to terms with the fact that theres a  year old girl who benches  lbs and a petite  lbers deadlifting  but theres some crazy girls out there.

Thered only be a relative handful of guys in the AFL whod be worldclass athletes since its a relatively small potential player pool.But the skills of the game are so unique and the dynamics of play so different to most other sports that latecomers to the game can generally only hope to be effective in the more athletic roles rather than skilfuldecision making roles.   The hope for the US imports is to turn them into ruckmen which is kind of like the centre in basketball.   They dont kick the ball much and theyre almost never really creative playmakers.But like American Football Australian football is as much an athletic competition as it is a skillful game like say soccer so theres definitely room for people who are a bit more raw skills wise. This is usually the case with ruckmen.  But the guys who dominate the game who are the most valuable players are the creative skilful playmakers.Its kind of like how in American football youll occasionally have track stars come to the game late who excel in running roles  but they dont become your quarterback.,sports,cuem7a9,1,t5_2qgzy

4968663,0,t1_cuktlt5,But youre not taking away the main point of their argument. For men fighting in this sport there is a lot more gradient of skill level from absolute beginner to the top ranks. For females there is a huge disparity between skill levels. Ronda is a great fighter and its hard to argue that any other female fighter is even close to her level. So yeah that could be said for any fighter... in her position. Fighters like Ali and Tyson went through the same thing of being able to eat their opponents alive. Eventually you get to a top tier level where youre not the obvious kingqueen anymore. Matches come down very close margins and you could end up losing a fight you felt you shouldve had. Only difference is that Ronda is like the first women fighter to climb that peak. Youre both right... she has had little competition in part because female fighting is not as developed and because she is a great female fighter. I think the fact that she is a great fighter has much more to do with it but it is pretty telling that there is no one to even challenge her at the top. One day well see plenty of female fighters on her level probably because shes inspiring a lot of women to give this sport a try. And one day well probably get to the point where she wouldnt even be able to challenge the top female... but like you mention itll be when shes already passed her prime.,sports,cuku5hi,22,t5_2qgzy

5000140,0,t1_cuonp4r,The Ballon DOr is irrelevant here as Maradona couldnt have won it since it wasnt open to nonEuropeans until . And once again were talking about an individual accolade. What I meant with the athleticism note is that Maradona could do the same kind of dribble the whole opposing team run around the whole field and score Messi does today with athletic means that were far inferior. And shoot free kicks like none before or after him. And do whatever he wanted with the ball.And then the teams Messi has won stuff before Neymar and might win more after Xavi and Iniesta sure but the point you seem to be missing  or you deliberately overlook  is that Barcelona has never been Messis team while every single team Maradona played in became immediately his because he was the best player but mostly because of his leadership and ability to make his teammates better. Messi never needed to do that he was always surrounded by superstars and when he wasnt when he managed to have his team read Argentina he lost.Oh yes he brought them to the final with Di Maria and Higuain and Lavezzi and... Well never mind but guess what Maradona did that too. Too bad he won it. And then he brought them to the final again four years later with arguably the worst side ever to reach a WC final beating Brazil and Italy on its home turf in the process and only narrowly losing to a German team that featured Lothar Matthaeus Andreas Brehme Jurgen Klinsmann Rudy Voeller Jurgen Kohler and Pierre Littbarski just to name a few. What was it Messi has to face teams who have  superstars? Which teams?Remember were trying to compare players from different eras here a third division team from any European league today would beat a national team from the s by just outrunning them but thats not the point the point is against the superstars of HIS time Maradona was light years ahead. He could win alone and he did. Messi cant. Charisma is not about a free kick stance or tattoos its about people following and believing in you. Messi doesnt even get close to that. You say that doesnt count? Come on.,sports,cuopd34,1,t5_2qgzy

5122936,0,t1_cv2vxsq,Aye they do have a sort of European equivalent of the American Dream in mind and to be fair it is a paradise comparative to what they are leaving. I dont think it will be possible to make Europe seem less attractive to them unless we implode or go Fourth Reich or something but the more achievable goal is indeed to make their own countries more attractive and safe to stay in.Where I live weve seen a few hundred thousand young people emigrate and most of those would have preferred to stay at home if they could but there were no prospects here. People naturally want to stay in their own country in the long term bar some exceptions. And if worldwide migration was limited to just those of all countries who wanted to move for the sake of it then thered be no real problems. But to get to that stage we need to sort a lot of things out to bring an end to this push factor that currently exists.The main thing is bringing an end to the kind of intervention that has destabilised the region so much over the centuries. They need to be left to sort out their own matters naturally and from the bottom up rather than a top down carpet bomb your problems approach.I think the decline of the secular left in many of these countries as a result of cold war rivalries and the fall of the USSR. Their financial support was gone while the conservative anticommunist and religious right of those countries got western support and have dominated since.Then aside from government interventions you have large corporations exploiting the people there and lining the pockets of the local elites and politicians. While this kind of carry on continues their economies and societies will always lag behind.The only way I can see these issues being dealt with is internationally and by challenging both our political and economic systems. It wont at all be easy but if thats what it takes to fix this problem then thats just how it is. In the mean time we do need to look after the refugees coming in and treat them humanely and try to defend Europes enlightenment principles from both fundamentalists coming in and the antiimmigrant right. Its going to be a bumpy ride. ,sports,cv3i7uw,1,t5_2qgzy

At one point he cant even help but smirk a little bit at the fact that shes struggling so much. Granted Tank Abbott isnt in his class but Gegard was maybe  in this video so the weight alone would make an incredibly huge impact.

Theres a reason why they have weight classes and even Rounda Rouseys admits that she would get her ass kicked fighting in most Mens UFC matches. Thats not to say she couldnt level most regular dudes on the street but Tank Abbott is not a regular dude he is a skilled fighter as well as also a massive human being and the guys hes lost to have been close to his size. If Rounda Rousey were to win that fight then all the power to her but realistically I dont see that happening.,sports,cvdd6je,1,t5_2qgzy

5355425,0,t1_cvw63nh, may have been the case for you but it definitely isnt like that everywhere. Most of the leagues I was in were fairly competitive well organized and some basketball and baseball had divisions. If you wanted to be in Division  you had to try out. If you didnt try out for Division  or you werent drafted by a team you played in Division . Almost all of the kids in Division  really enjoyed playing and were pretty good at whatever sport it was. I played in both divisions in baseball so Ill use it as an example since it was my favorite sport and the one I was best at. In baseball I would make division  whenever I would try out for it but some years I just wanted to have fun and not play super competitively so I wouldnt even try out for division . Even when I was in division  well more than half of the kids seemed to at least be having fun and wanted to be out there. Some kids didnt and you could pretty easily tell who they were but they were in the minority. The division system was a very good system imo. The kids that werent very good were able to play at a lower talent level and the kids who were good were able to play at a higher skill level.  I never played hockey because I lived in Texas but I doubt that only  of kids are interested. I still really enjoyed playing basketball even though I wasnt really good at it. The only sport I didnt enjoy playing was football even though thats my favorite sport to watch now that Im an adult. Football was also the only sport I played where maybe about half of kids were interested but it definitely wasnt . Id assume playing in a shitty unorganized league would make the experience much less enjoyable but saying that ths of kids dont want to be there is kind of pushing it.,sports,cvw7shr,0,t5_2qgzy

Realistically operating in embedded status with the leagues is contrary to the public image of NFL and baseball and basketball being family sports. They are not. Basically fantasy betting is exactly like sports and games betting and should be classified as such. There should also be limits to the amount of accounts each credit card can have and how many bets one can make in a day. ,sports,cw1elbq,1,t5_2qgzy

5422540,0,t3_3pb2tb,Not watching the game so I dont know how it panned out. But the formation  is called the swinging gate. Basically the QB or punter in this case lines up under center while everyone goes to one side of the field. The idea is to draw the defenders to the center and QB. The defense thinks they can get to the QB fast enough to sack him. Meanwhile the QB tries to swing a pass to a receiver as fast as possible before being sacked. At that point the blockers outnumber the defenders and the receiver can get a few yards quickly. Theoretically. ,sports,cw4sbaf,20,t5_2qgzy

And any speculation was based in reason and skillful analysis of tape. Now you get one  second highlight for every  minute segment on social stories picking who will win fantasy analysis or crap debate on some meaningless aspect of sports.ESPN used to allow me to follow more sports then I have time to watch by showing me what happened last night. Then on the weekend I could hear nerdt break downs of football and honest in depth reporting on relatively meaningful stories OTL and The Sports Reporters.Now I watch washed up athletes speculate about what will happen so they can argue about it later mean while the most important part of ESPN the highlights a way to artfully condense a  hour contest into a Shor and digestible yet compelling story is all but gone.ESPN as I knew it is dead.

Ive seen other catches turn incomplete because they went down and didnt maintain control of the ball and in this case hes down as hes trying to get control of the ball. I know the ball didnt touch the ground but still. For that matter when was this play considered dead? I see he gets up and holds up the ball when was he actually considered down? Should he have kept running since he wasnt touched down after he got possession?,sports,cwctndx,2,t5_2qgzy

I cant for the life of me understand why she looked so tired. If thats who you are and the consequences are this dire. Why not train harder? Run some hills. I know over confidence and yes men coaches are the go to excuses but I mean this more hypothetically. If that were me Id be so anxious about losing that that Id sleep in the wall sit position. ,sports,cx0rgyc,6,t5_2qgzy
5676834,0,t1_cx0q41b,Couple things. First people dont by nature want to upset the circle jerk. Just like youre not seeing hardly anyone defend her now. Those with opposing views dont want to state their opinion and get jumped on by a ton of people and get embarrassed. Second she is polarizing. To me there are things I love and hate about her in equal measure. I love that she is incredibly honest. She will not bullshit you. I also hate how poor of a sport she has always been. She talks shit then wont even acknowledge her opponents efforts after matches. Lastly its the nature of this sport. Styles are so huge in MMA. Same thing happened with Anderson Silva. Its like you have all these people who have been waiting to hate on someone and when it finally happens and they just got embarrassed now these people want to try to retroactively say that they had known such and such fighter was overrated all along. Truth is Holly holm might lose to Someone like Misha tate and Rhonda will continue to beat Misha every time. We will see though. Rhonda might come back stronger and Wipe the floor with Holly. I doubt it though. In MMA it seems you are only as good as your last fight. Also Rhondas striking isnt terrible. She is decent but yeah is obviously going to look bad going toe to toe in a boxing match with Holly who is an all time boxing great,sports,cx0rmks,5,t5_2qgzy

As for destroying the phone? Shady but once Brady was told his phone was not needed he destroyed it. But why? Well probably because there was some personal things on there that he would rather not let the NFL have. But after the phone was destroyed and they said they needed his phone after they said they didnt Brady tried to get a text log from his service provider cant remember if he was successful. But as for the argument of SOMEONE deflating the balls... Well the two main people under investigation was Jastremski and McNally. And the NFL already had their phones with all their texts in it. Based off your argument Im assuming you havent read into the situation much. Hopefully this will help you get a better understanding,sports,cydep03,0,t5_2qgzy

If it was stringently enforced the game would be much more frequently interrupted and would favor styles that depend on set plays which looks and feels very different from traditional soccer. That isnt a good or bad thing its just not what most of the community wants. Moreover diving and its derivatives happens in a lot of sports.

Sochi is a tiny ski resort town and they way over built it.Also the new infrastructure they build to deal with the influx of people needs to be sustainable after the fact.

6761837,0,t1_d0inqxi,High school sports are very important in the training hierarchy of pro sports in the US. Players of Football Baseball Basketball are all recruited into college teams or directly into the pros for baseball if they are good enough. Once in college you get a step up in ability on every level then if you excel in college you are now ready for the pros. Since soccer is not as popular among the really athletic people in high school you lose the people who could probably play soccer pretty well to those other three sports. Now if it was the reverse and soccer was the most popular sport among high school athletes then our national team would have the best athletes in the country playing soccer.

However Jordan is elite at many things but he hasnt really done anything like Gretskys scoring record that are truly untouchable.Jordan ranks th in all time scoring. He has  championships while other all time greats like Simmons has almost double that. He has a lot of MVPs but KAJ has more. He doesnt rank that high in assists or rebounds obviously. His peak seasons statistically are comparable or lesser than some other all time greats. His overall average is very good but comparable or lesser than the averages of others.Im actually struggling to think of any primary categories that he actually dominates. I think you can string together some arbitrary stats like most pt  rebound games or something but otherwise he didnt really shatter anything partially because he missed seasons from his injury and his two temporary retirements.

He earned the right to lead the team but Elway was obsessed with giving Manning that storybook send off. Osweiller got screwed.In my opinion he was cheated a legitimate chance at a Super Bowl ring. He was justified to leave. Reminds me when Alex Smith was concussed and they made Kapernick the permanent starter.

While diagnostic terms facilitate clinical care and access to insurance coverage that supports mental health these terms can also have a stigmatizing effect. gtDSM aims to avoid stigma and ensure clinical care for individuals who see and feel themselves to be adifferent gender than their assigned gender. It replaces the diagnostic name gender identity disorderwith gender dysphoria.Sounds like the DSMV considers it a mental disorder especially when it goes far enough to have the person selfharm especially in such a way that they either surgically have organs removed or they are so distressed in their own appearance that they must dress as a woman.  ,sports,d2bfdeb,-5,t5_2qgzy

Not everybody is a saint putting this woman in a mens room where men have been drinking is placing her in a dangerous situation.  At best she might be regarded strangely. At worst she might be subject to unwanted advances. And dont think of saying theyll know its a trans person. Not all people are so evident and when youre talking dark clubs and bars and clouded vision from alcohol. Whats worse if she is identified then she could be the victim of violence.

Sean Kilpatrick quickly breaks the NBA record for most consecutive  point games the Suns enter the allstar break leading the Warriors and Spurs by  games in the west.

That said I could also see how it could be embraced and some might find pride in their culture being alluded to in media popular culture in a positive way however general said representation may be.

Its a lot easier to build hype around individuals and create storylinesdrama than trying to explain on a deeper level of why x offense works against y defense. People just love drama in general. Its a lot easier to just say Kyrie played awfully and is bringing down the team than to explain how the Golden state defense controlled him. Casual fan base just either want to see lebron lose or the Warriors just drain s all game. Its what the media painted and its how they get more casual people to watch.

He was set up to retire as a hero of the city had he stayed with the Cards even had he performed like he has with the Angels.I did what most hurt Cardinals fans did and heckle and take delight in the first couple of years he spent with the Angels seemingly basking in bad karma with a clifflike dropoff in production.These days I just feel bad for him.  He had arguably the most amazing first ten years in the league of any player ever.  Hes since been downright mediocre.  Hell get into the hall no doubt provided he can stay away from any cheating scandals but it probably wont end up as one of the best if not the best hitter of all time.On the NBA side of things I was always loyal to whatever team Charles Barkley played for I never felt loyalty to a specific team.,sports,d4kz3sn,3,t5_2qgzy

8129728,0,t1_d4tsjay,Phelps is literally the single most tested athlete in the world likely ever. He leads the statistics for USADA drug testing. Once in a generation talent like that definitely attracts a huge magnifying glass from the sports community and theyve never found a blemish on him despite testing him  times in a period where most athletes in the testing pool are tested  times. The reason for his utter dominance is probably the confluence of being a massive statistical outlier in three different factors that contribute to great swimming. Talent body shape and work ethictraining time. The ideal body shape for swimming is tall lean but with a long torso instead of just long legs. Hes  and just looking at him his weird long torso is immediately apparent which just mechanically provides much more power from the back muscles crucial for swimming and tennis. As a  guy with a longish torso I caught mad pressure to dive hard into serious training for both those sports one or the other obvs from professional level coaches who go years between seeing such an advantageous build they said probably mostly as salesman for their services but still and wanted my parents to hire them to train me for legitimate potential Olympicprofessional level aspirations but I was already too old having never even touched a racket to have a shot at doing anything real in tennis so it wasnt worth the sacrifices of training that hard and despite already being a strong swimmer I declined to continue just playing basketball and football where I was high school elite more from my build than talent or hard training but unremarkablenot good on any higher level. I now realize that in basketball I was just another tall guy and my height advantage was neutralized by everyone elses height advantage whereas in swimming I would have been much more of an statistical outlier and the potential was there to actually stand out on a wide scale if I put in the training and was lucky enough to have that je ne sais quoi talent that differentiates the best from the great even so I still wouldnt have done it because I wanted to smoke pot get laid ...and do math... and not be fucking miserable...or working hard. BUT the point is that Phelps had that rare ideal body shape and potential that some coaches said I had rare for them to see but not unfindable but he ALSO gave up his life to train full time AND ALSO had that one in a million raw cerebral talent for the sport specifically. Some people can have  of those and professionals usually have one and a halftwo but its super rare like once in a generation for someone to have all three. Im a perfect example of how rare it is. Blessed by fucking Zeus in one of the categories yet utterly hopelessly deficient in the both the other two categories ie have normalnot psychotic ambitionwork ethic. As rare as I was out of the normal human population thats how rare a me WITH the ambitiondedication is out of a population of people like me then again out of a population of those people. Those that have all three dont just excel at their game they dominate it. Phelps Federer Jordan Woods Bolt. Perfect athletes. Holy shit I started adderall rambling. Sorry. Im from Baltimore and we really love our boy Mike and Im personally really fascinated by dominant athletes especially Mike and Federer and the things that raise them so consistently above the merely great. But yeah nah no doping. Just nighunheard of quality and a training ethic that could arguable be labeled a mental disorder.Obligatory David Foster Wallace Roger Federer as a Religious Experience article about athletic dominance and highest level tennis playedit Holy fuck thats more text than I thought I wrote even after realizing that the addy was in play here.

LeBron had a worse team than Durant does now but LeBron clearly was involved in many of those decisions. Durant never closed off the possibility of leaving and watched Harden get traded away. Durant wouldnt have signed off on that and LeBron wouldnt have let a trade like that happen on his team. While I can see why this looks worse from one perspective I think its much different than that. ,sports,d4z0hzi,0,t5_2qgzy

With each graduating class that Paterno is a God mentality fades.  Personally I think Paternos actions were disgusting and unforgivable. There are absolutely no excuses for turning a blind eye to child rape.The man gave an insane amount of money to the university which is why I think his reputation is still upheld in the minds of some. In my opinion no amount of charity can redeem him from his decision to keep quiet.

8296536,0,t3_4t2q8g,One element has to be the stadium layout. With some sports a significant percentage of the seats cant see the action on any given play. Hockey is a good example of this  when the action is at the other end of the rink or against the boards it can be difficult to see whats going on especially if youre seated close enough to the ice that the glass distorts the view.Baseball doesnt have that problem by and large. Most people are seated in such a way that the action is entirely visible. So the benefit of having live action on the screen is minimal.The one exception to this might be outfield seats at least when it comes to being able to see the strike zone. But fixing that would require putting a screen in the infield facing outward which would be inconveniently placed e.g. very high up or else would block the view of a number of infield seats. And even worse it would be a huge visual distraction to the team in the field.Additionally the screen cant be hung in the middle of the stadium unlike in basketball or hockey or whatnot because the sport involves hitting balls high in the air. And mostly theres no roof.Soccer also has most of these qualities and I think youll find the same effect there much less focus on a screen.,sports,d5emisl,1,t5_2qgzy

8401484,0,t1_d5rpoky,You are correct in stating that a player who booked wont remain suspended for league matches since this is a friendly.  However depending on the the governing body of this competition the suspension will carry over to the next game of the equivalent level.  As an example if these were National Teams the suspension would not go to the league level where they play unless they were suspended for all activity in the FIFA body they would only be suspended for their next national team game.  In this event where it is a friendly most likely the suspension would be for the next friendly match OR the governing body may step in and could suspend him for a league game if they felt it is justified.  In this case it is not a long term solution but a game management technique that would prevent further escalation of the behavior possibly causing more injury to another players in the game.Unfortunately sports are in the heat of a moment thing.  As an official I am not worried about how the next game either team playing is impacted.  I am more worried about the current match the current roster the current score the current conditions and are the behaviors of the current match being maintained correctly.  After my decision to book a player yellow or red it is up to the governing body to follow up with the report I write that says what occurred and what my initial reaction to the play was.  They will continue the punishment and decision.  It is much like the US government one Branch writes the Laws FIFA one branch enforces the laws The Officals and one branch rules on the punishment of breaking the rules the governing body UEFA English Premiere League a combination of both.  ,sports,d5rqcr9,1,t5_2qgzy

And it probably has something to do with the fact that not many Mexicans get opportunities to play in their home leaguethe exceptional allstars go out of country sure but you are talking about an almost infinitesimally small number of players compared to the people out there who might do something if given the opportunity.A good example of this is the US as soon as the US put together a domestic league their national team started to improve and continues to improve.

Now why they suck is beyond me . During their respective seasons they do great. Is it lack of passion  I dont know. But it shouldnt be like that  probably the hype they get and they underperform.

A fight broke out and the surrounding crowd told Stadium security who the culprits were and they were escorted out of the stadium.

Essentially what this boils down to a that there is a monopolistic collusion going on between all the member schools of the NCAA which governs. We dont allow this in any other field. It is so bad that they basically tell kids who work for them for  hours a week that they arent even employees and dont get those protections. For these programs its basically win at all costs and these kids primarily from lower socioeconomic groups are just put into the meat grinder used up and spat back out. The NCAA even regulates how much food the school can give these kids. Some of these kids have talked about being extremely hungry at night. They have no money they cant really hold jobs the National Labor Relations Board has estimated they put in on average  hours a week on football. Note that on virtually every football play where there is contact they are going through the rough equivalent of a  MPH car wreck each and every time.  hours of that a week their bodies are trying to grow they already are behind the curve in terms of being prepared to actually go to college they dont have time to study properly etc. Some will argue well this is what they chose! Thats fine as long as their is a market for their services right? They could just go elsewhere. The problem is there is no market because of the collusive nature of the NCAA organization.  ,sports,d6rzmhk,3,t5_2qgzy

8885089,0,t1_d7fu8x4,Again no one pays attention to interviews. No one will CARE what a player says in an interview. Thats not a protest thats a a few words that no one will listen to. Protest requires bold action it requires being offensive it requires making people uncomfortable and angry it requires personal sacrifice like opening yourself up to people hating you. The Civil Rights Movement was FULL of protests like this one. This is what protest is!!! This is civil disobedience this is what Martin Luther King Jr taught!! You can make the choice to be offended because people dont place the same value on a symbol as you do. Or you can choose to see individuals opening themselves up to criticism in order to draw attention to a cause they care about. The players arent spitting on a flag or booing during the anthem or telling veterans to go fuck themselves. Theyre just making the choice to not honor something and I dont see how that even counts as disrespectful. If you were in a Muslim country and heard the bells going off signaling that its time to pray and you didnt go pray would you think that youre being offensive? No youd probably just think it doesnt apply to you because youre not religious. Same with this protest. Im not honoring the anthem because I dont feel patriotic right now and here are my reasons. Again you can choose to be offended but it might be a good idea to examine why you feel that people HAVE to honor their country publicly and how you expect any change to occur if people dont take a stand that draws attention.,sports,d7fv1wu,1,t5_2qgzy

Player can fall to both knees and other hand someone jump on and not be able press him down and the carrier can flick the ball off or even stand and go againI think anyway.. its all about ball arm going to ground. Usually though someone goes down and other kg blokes are helping they go flat.  You see it come up when someone trips or bounces off a defender but holds it enough to pass from ground Edit uZombieHasey pointed out the held rule. So thats when a player tries to step forward but makes no ground. It counts as a tackle and is called being held. So in the scenario above say a player hits a forward falls to his knees and off hand while the forward player just braces to hold him and that player takes his legal charge off the hand but then does not push back the forward then the player is held.  If he palms down the big bloke and runs on to score hes good to goEditeditThats why old mate forward and his friends all jump on the carrier as soon as he faulters,sports,d7j3f78,1,t5_2qgzy

It has many many many practical medical uses and many sports medicine uses. I forgot which tennis player it was but a while back in the s I believe they changed the rules up which disallowed the use of it during a match because the player got a shot in their joints midmatch and it was considered an unfair advantage. Now I dont know WADAs rules very well but Im not aware that the use of these drugs is disallowed year round. Players are humans too and they put their bodies through immense stress early on in life.

They cant just throw an  yard bomb and hit bolt in stride.  It would need to be within  yards and Bolt would need to get open first. And there are plenty of ways that a defense can prevent that.   jamming him at the line of scrimmage or rolling a safety over the top  yards deep.  If you know a players gonna run straight up the field every time its pretty easy to design a strategy to cover him.   You need some kind of.deceptionunpredictability to get open  which is where rout running comes into play.

I mean cmon. although my favorite part has to be the fact that he isnt even the youngest captain in NHL history like all the headlines claim. according to the wiki thats held by someone else. who was  days younger than this guy when he was named. ,sports,d8fww8s,-25,t5_2qgzy

9422015,0,t1_d99ofvf,The secondary market is not driven by bots much if at all and your example does not reflect reality. In the specific instance of the cubs world seriesYou have a rabid fan base a tiny historic ball park a huge amount of season ticket holders with an  person waiting list and millions of people who want a few thousand tickets and would happily pay face value or even a few hundred more than face value. You have season ticket holders who really want to go to the game and paid  a ticket in most cases. they would still go if tickets were going for a few hundred dollars. so people have to pay thousands to get them to begrudgingly sell.At some almost point everyone has a price.Take bots of out it and were in the same boat.MLB gives tons of tickets to playersumpires sponsors etc . Bots dont make millions of people want tickets and bots dont make only a few thousand be available for sale on the secondary market.There are almost none left over. If people werent willing to pay thousands for a tickets those operating bots couldnt sell them for that.You refuse to actually adress that issue or the issue of if bots didnt exist other people would just get the tickets.Youre making it seem like if bots didnt get the tickets there would be some magical surplus when there wouldnt be.Without bots A lot of those people who can now buy at face value would use the tickets meaning the supply of tickets on the secondary market would be even less.Now if these extra tickets and the number of people who wanted them were similar you would be correct. But its not. The reality is in this case its a rounding error. And while inevitably some of those tickets would go to people currently paying thousands a lot would just go to lucky fans who cant pay thosuands but will happily pay  a ticket. And then where are we ? With LESS tickets available on the secondary  market less than  of the people who would have bought tickets at crazy prices who dont have to and the rest are in the same or worse shape when it comes to getting tickets than they are in now.If you want to tell me this would be fairer Id agree. But it would still not bring down the secondary market prices. There would just be less tickets on the secondary markets and different people selling them.Youre just reallocating who makes the profit on these tickets and helping at best  if the people who want them while keeping the high secondary market prices the same  or even inflating them for the other .Bots CAN NOT create a market especially in an environment like this one.Even in your example you gave a  ratio. The ratio of people who would pay face to tickets avaiable for public sales for these games isnt . Its hundreds to  if not more.Really the only time bots might significantly affect the overall prices on the secondary market if that ratio is more like  or . If bots could create a market Dodgers tickets for the LCS wouldnt have been selling for  dollars for games in the NLCS. You need a crazy amount of demand and a tiny amount of supply to get a situation like  the Cubs WS tix at Wrigley.This is the most expensive seat in pro sports history thats not bc of bots. Its bc millions of people want something that barely exists.Its easy to blame the scalpers or bots but that doesnt look at the reality of the situation. The bottom line is people are self entitled and want to get something at about  of its real market value that millions of other people want. Theyre living in fairy tale land.Ive gone to hundreds of games at below face value. in many cases well below face.  That too is supply and demand.If nobody wants the tickets at  dollars prices come down. If millions of people want them for  bucks you get  Wrigley Field WS prices.The funny thing nobody complains when they get tickets with a face valye of  for  bucks and talks about the evil scalpers then. Its when they want the hot ticket and think the world revolves around them that they do.Im not even a Cubs fan but I love baseball. If i could get a ticket for tomorrow for a few hundred bucks Id go. But nobody owes me that when they could sell it for a few thousand.There are bars in Wrigleyville charging  dollars   a head for a cover charge. And getting it. Thats how crazy this market is. But that also has nothing to do with bots.,sports,d9ab04h,1,t5_2qgzy

When racism was about not making judgments about people based on race fighting racism was a noble cause.  At this point weve seen Democrats go so far as to try to redefine racism to explicitly excuse racism among nonwhites.  Its the same tactic they used to consolidate southern white voters with the KKK.I dont like Donald but Im relieved that Dems didnt win and hopeful for the first time that media social media and educational censorship and bullying proved ineffective.

Compare that to a sport like basketball where at most a referee might add  points to one side. However those  points would be split over the course of dozens of calls whereas a soccer referee only gets to make one call. Players dont contest calls in American Sports because no one call is worth the risk of being ejected but in soccer there is often a game defining call. Therefore to reduce stoppage time and arguing which leads to fights its important that the referees position is not undermined.,sports,dbo2i05,12,t5_2qgzy

10316637,0,t1_dcdflzy,We dont have a promotiondemotion system like many other countries with soccer. Theres only one league for most sports in the US. Many Americans dislike professional sports and so instead watch college football or basketball instead. This is more common in certain regions especially in the Southeast where college sports and rivalries are very popular.EDIT I just realized that I didnt really answer your question. To answer your question most of the time I think the local fanbase probably finds a new team to watch either a local college team or a nearby professional team. For example the city of Portland Oregon lacks its own NFL football team so most of the populace support the nearby Seattle Seahawks. A new team may come to the city but not for many many years. The current Baltimore Ravens NFL football team was originally the Cleveland Browns NFL football team until it moved during . The city and fans of the Cleveland were outraged and a new Cleveland Browns team was established in . But this short of an interval between teams is highly unusual. For example the current Carolina Hurricanes NHL hockey team were originally the Hartford Whalers until they moved in . The Seattle Supersonics NBA basketball team moved to Oklahoma City in  and became the Oklahoma City Thunder. There is currently no NHL hockey team in Hartford or a NBA basketball team in Seattle.,sports,dcdg3e5,20,t5_2qgzy

10417336,1,t1_dcolcf4,gt Yea muscle doesnt protect your brain from getting bounced around in your skull. KOs can be the result of concussion.  But the compression of blood vessels in your neck which feed your brain are the main culprit.  They get compressed because your head whips around very quickly.  If you have thick muscular neck your head is less likely to experience extreme acceleration relative to the rest of your body.So muscles can theoretically shield you from knockouts  hard to tell how much it matters.,sports,dcovg2d,2,t5_2qgzy

10455018,0,t1_dcsnwb7,That depends a lot on what youre doing.  QBs can get away with it because they need flexibility in their shoulders and control.  Their throwing power isnt from sheer strength.  Most of them arent runners.  They dont have push through people or out run them.  Running backs need speed and to push through people.  Wide recievers need the same in a different balance.  Linemen and Blocking Backs need power and weight to push other players.   Defense needs speed to catch players and the strength to bring them down in various balances based on position corners and safeties are more speed line backers are balanced and line men need more power.  Most QBs dont have to sprint very often and dont spend much time having to blocktackle other players or resist being tackled frequently unless youre Andrew Luck and your O Line is Swiss cheese.There are exceptions though.  Cam Newton is an exceptional athlete.  Hes strong and hes fast.  He doesnt have the same finesse throwing that many pass heavy QBs do but he has greater value by being a more physical athlete.Every athlete needs talent and skill.  It doesnt matter how fast you can run if you cant catch throw read another players movement or have terrible body control.  It doesnt matter if your  time is sub  youre probably not playing a team sport without skill or talent.,sports,dct6irs,1,t5_2qgzy

10939692,0,t1_de82g8o,I understand your point of view. But if you listen to the fighters who actually put their health at risk they disagree.Rarely fighters who got beat complain that the fight got stopped to late. More common is fighters who complain because they lost when the referee stopped the fight because they think it was stopped to early and they still were able to turn it around.And their are many amazing examples of fighter who were down and got pounded just to turn it around and come back winning the fight.Both fighters are not really capable to make a reasonable decision when the fight should stop. The one losing often would accept to take a lot more damage and get hurt than is good for him and than the referee will allow. While the one winning might believe his opponnent is out when he still is well capable of coming back.It is the referees job to stop the fight. But any fighter is allowed to stop the fight and they have a corner who can stop the fight for them if they cant. But a fighter cant decide for his opponent that he is done.The only way to reasonably stop the ground and pound would be to forbid it. And you can bet that nearly no fighter wants this they would speak out about this heavly maybe some grappling specialist because it gives them an adavantage.While the ground and pound looks very brutal it is only people who are not part of the sport who complain about it. But it definitly is an example of why a good refere is so important. It is a big responsibility to stop the fight when a fighter cant defend himself anymore and before he takes unnecessary damage but not when he still can turn the fight around and is not actually defensless.But it is not the responsibilty of the opponent. This is the responsibility of the referee. People often forget its not only two people in the ring. There are three! Two fighters and a referee. And to determine the moment a fight stops is the referees responsibility not the fighter.,sports,de8cp3e,5,t5_2qgzy

11032697,1,t1_deiakkc,Theres a huge difference between a dive and embellishment. If someone fouls you and you physically have the ability to stay up but the ball has rolled out of your control or youre in a good position for a free kick its smart and strategic to fall and take the foul. Exaggerating a little to make sure the ref makes the call or gives a card is fine and goes on in all sports even the tough American sports like Football. The only thing I have a problem with is a complete and deliberate flop with no contact and that isnt very common in soccer. When it does happen not only is a foul not even called but the player flopping gets a yellow a lot of the time. ,sports,deij4ps,3,t5_2qgzy

11048697,0,t1_dek8jsn,Ill never forget the last year I played regular little league I was  I was on a really dominant team.  We had three dudes who would go on to pitch in college as our starters so we were dominant to say the least.  I played shortstop.  We were  heading into a game against another  team.  In a  game regular season this was basically the championship game.  The game was super tight going into the top of the last inning.  We were winning .  They were able to get a guy on first and then sacrifice him over to second base for the middle of their lineup.  Now the guy we had playing left field we will call him C had never played a game of baseball before this season in his life.  He never caught the ball when it came to him couldnt throw the ball really well never once got a hit etc.  In this most crucial of moments one of our pitchers actually gave up a hard hit ball an absolute seed smashed into left center field.  Our center fielder was shaded to the right so he had no shot at it so it was only C.  He blindly stuck his glove out and somehow this bullet landed perfectly in the pocket.  He was stunned and stood there for a second before I started screaming at him to throw me the ball in.  The guy on second hadnt tagged up and we had a shot to get the double play for the win. He looks at me and uncorks the most beautiful throw Id ever seen him make right to my chest.  I turned and made the easy flip to second for the win and the championship.  Ill never forget how happy that kid was.  Its still one of the coolest memories I have from playing sports.Edita word,sports,dekcn3p,106,t5_2qgzy

Im not saying its good or bad Im just fed up with people who think this situation is special or any different than any other labor exploitation in our economy. Capitalism is the exploitation of labor thats just how it works.

She also won the Nevada state championships in the  and  hurdles.  The NBA average is supposedly  but the top  were all on the  range so  for Williams compared to  average women and freak men who outjump their cohorts by  may not be as outlandish as it sounds.  On the other hand top candidates in recent male NBA drafts have generally been in the  range for a nostep standing leap which makes  for Williams seem unlikely unless hers was a for a running vertical.

There is no reason this shouldnt be over as much money as unc spent on a private investigator that released its findings to the public this should be over by now.
