907181,0,t3_24i3zq,Here are my tips for visiting the Goodwill outletWear gloves. Seriously wear gloves. Everything in the bins in unsorted so that means you WILL find used socks and underwear and everything else is fairly filthy.If you find something you like but youre not sure about it put it in your cart. If you pick up something and put it down it wont be there when you circle around to the bin you put it in.When the new bins come out the first ten minutes are basically the Nickelodeon Toys R Us super toy run except with big fat guys and people who havent bathed in three days. When they put the bins out go for the hard goods bins first. Those are the ones that will empty out of good stuff first. After that you can pick through the clothing piles.Be polite but not too polite. A lot of the people shopping at the Outlet are doing it for a living looking for good shit to buy cheap and then flip on Ebay. There is a thin layer of civility in play here. You probably wont be directly shoved out of the way for something but they will grab something right from in front of you if it looks like youre lingering.If you want the true experience get there when they open and stay there until they close. The Goodwill Outlet rewards people that have stamina. If you just drop in and pick around for a half hour you probably wont find anything good and youll leave wondering why people go crazy for blue bins filled with literal garbage.,ThriftStoreHauls,ch7ehqu,46,t5_2spop

It is a nice A but without the tag on the inside we will have to pass. The tag is actually very critical to the value of these jackets and without it a large majority of the value is lost.which surprises me because I assumed the larger ones were collectible because people want to actually WEAR the jacket not look at the tiny size square.

The sides swing up and the boxes in the middle descend into the table the sides then can lock together on the top hiding the contents.Our best guesses are perhaps a way to hide liquor during prohibition or maybe a portable cash box. Maybe something for poker chips? Thanks for the help!!,ThriftStoreHauls,czwuo7j,3,t5_2spop

11337175,0,t1_dfh0h41,So this has been a pretty big wedding trend for at least the past five years. Mismatched china. There are even companies that will rent for weddings! Some people go all out mismatched. Every color and pattern. I stuck to a loose theme of pastel florals with gold or silver accents. I relied heavily on buying sets anywhere from  to  of the same plate with a handful of one offs thrown in. We are having a buffet so it will be in stacks not set up as place settings. I will probably mix up the stacks when we are setting up because I dont want one table to have all the same plates.Afterward I am probably going to sell it at a deep discount from what I paid. I was thinking Id be happy selling it all as a lot to someone else planning a wedding maybe at  of what I paid? Dinner plates were  each dessert plates were probably an average of c punch cups c vases about  each and I have about  of miscellaneous silver linens serving platters. Depending on how much more I add Id like get about  reselling. That is a steal for someone. If I cant sell it as a lot on Craigslist Ive considered selling the plates to Replacements.com.
