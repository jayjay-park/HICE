7323058,0,t3_4fo9wb,Its really funny but regardless of where you stand on the subject I think its a broken analogy. We have the technology to objectively identify someones height a ruler lol. And their ethnic ancestry DNA tests. We have not yet identified hard and fast conclusions to explain the phenomenon of gender identity not your birth sex thats also objective but of gender identity same as we have not yet with sexual orientation. Again this is absolutely irrespective of ones position on the matter  science could yet prove that its a mental disease or it could prove its a genetic condition. So I can appreciate the point the video is trying to make and I definitely dont want to dump on the humour because it was totally funny but I wouldnt say it proves a point about anything. I intentionally left out the age example because people can objectively identify with another age autism or other conditions associated with developmental delays but that is an entirely different discussion. Overall I take the approach that if a   year old white guy wants to identify as a  year old Chinese woman...if its not bringing harm to anyone else than just do your crazy thang in your crazy corner and count me out of it. ,RedPillWives,d2akxwt,6,t5_3ddkr

I can imagine it would be a possible scenario but not with the amount of information we were given!I agree with this but Im going to offer a hilarious alternative view that I didnt realize I had until my last comment. The reason I think I love this movie so much is because to me its about Jacob and Cal not Hannah. I feel like she just kind of had to happen to make it a real movie. Watching Jacob take Cal under his wing is legitimately one of my favourite modern movie duos and really breaks the BP narrative although its a sock puppet for it in other parts. ,RedPillWives,d2hiwcm,1,t5_3ddkr

The confusion is supported by a subjective assessment of what alpha behaviors are.gt  I think that a lot of women fixate on the labels and an invented identity that maybe represents their best self that they aspire to be like. Yes and this is a risk that comes with every selfassessment. But I also think it is influenced subconsciously by taking in RP theory specifically.

7760428,0,t1_d3o0mvl,gt So in theory if you want to be liked by women you have to display higher value even if you are a woman yourself.  But it has to be ACTUAL higher value and not PERCEIVED. I think this is where women fuck up. I have way too many friends to count that think they are the shit because they have  s of friends  many male friends thus they think theyre attractive  good income  middle class or above and  are really social and do a lot with their free time.But they are not higher value. I think it would be a mistake for women to just assume that if you have several of these things checked off that makes you higher value. Ive seen really classy lower class status women walk into a room and everyone is drawn to her. Shes subtly beautiful and feminine and does okay for herself. Women would instantly be jealous. THAT to me shows value.If you arent jealous of a person in those ways aforementioned I think its fair to say shes of equal or lesser value than you. ,RedPillWives,d3oau2e,1,t5_3ddkr

8459355,0,t1_d5yy7vf,if a girl is acting like sexually available to multiple men in public men will write her off as a slut or slutty measuring degree but the premise still stands. they wont need to ask what her ncount is because the determination of her status has already been decided. if the number of her sexual partners was equal or more important men would walk up to attention whores and outright ask. they dont have to. her behavior is the primary metric for sluthood. so ncount is less important than public behavior of sexual availability. men will rather a woman have high ncount but behaves reasonably and marry her and start a family with her  than be with a woman who behaved in a way that was sexually embarrassing to him or their potential or actual relationship ie flirting all the time having male friends and treating them like orbiters dressing for male attention and validation etc.,RedPillWives,d5yyd1w,7,t5_3ddkr

But then I also know that they are probably right. And they are also the only ones which I trust completely. I sometimes notice how other Friends or rather acquaintances try to have an influence on me. It start with simple things like Oh you shouldnt go home now you could have another drink up to things that concern my relationship or my career.I think its especially dangerous for people who dont know where they stand in life and what they want in life to get influenced by friends and probably not always in a good way. And Ive been there. With my exboyfriend I was not so sure when to stand on his side and when something was his fault which led to me mimicking our friends and how they behaved towards him.

9911473,0,t1_daz3opf,Ariel was younger  or so I think?  Her rebellion is typical kid wants to push boundaries and go after the bad  boy  which really just means guy parents  disapprove of.  She actually does have proper respect of her father displayed both by expressions of fear and regret. For example she begs him not to destroy her treasures  she doesnt angrily yell at him or try to throw her weight around she grabs his arm and yells Please no! but Triton continues on because he believes in discipline and nothing else has gotten through to her.  She tries to explain herself a few times. In Ariels case and this is something she shares with Mulan and Pocahontas its more that theres a lack of full understanding about where the father is coming from and the women dont fully recognize or appreciate things like obedience order tradition safety. That said they still all want the approval of their fathers and it distresses them to know they are angry or directly have that anger aimed at them.  Triton is a king worried for the safety of his people.  And she affectionly calls Triton daddy  even when panicked or upset.  Jasmine uses the formal father  even though he is very informal  jovial  and not overbearing.  The sultan doesnt think of himself as a ruler because the resolution of the movie has him saying something to the effect of well am I the sultan or not?  From this day forth the princess may marry whomever she wants. it at literally never occured to him to change the law  or even that he had the ability TO change the laws. Given the choice  I would trust Triton to protect a kingdom far more than the sultan.  In any event  although Jasmine and Ariel both rebel  Jasmine does so after showing she does not respect her dad in more ways than Ariel. Ariel also has respect for Tritons power and standing shes just adventurous naive and curious. Ariel at least understands why her father has rules about humans she just disagrees that they are dangerous.  I have always had a personal theory that Ariels mother loved the human world too and she befriended them then something happened and she was killed  which is why Triton made the law. On another note  Disney has some interesting things to say about single fathers and single mothersstep mothers.  The fathers are not villains they act to protect their daughters or they have a desire to  in Mulans case Fa cannot act because that would expose her.  The women however  limit and control the step daughter for selfish reasons.  Triton and  Chief Powhatan want to protect their people from danger.  They are more militaristic and will use force to discipline  and they want obedienceorder.  Belles father Papa  Janes dad  and the Sultan are all much friendlier and warmer.  All except Jasmine in this group  are very close to their fathers and share a friendship and understanding of them that other people miss.  AuroraRose is rare in that she HAS both her parents.  Mulans dad also papa  I think  is more like Triton and the Chief  but he is not an official ruler  just a respected member of the village.  Snow white has the evil queen  cinderella her stepmother.  The only woman to have a direct evil male figure is Megara with Hades Hercules. The only mothers depicted in human form prior to  are Auroras mom Mulans and wendys. There are several animal mothers.  Bambi she dies  Perdita  Dalmations  Sarabi Lion King  Dumbo  Peter Pan   WendyMichaelJohn have both parents as well  The Arisocats  and Tarzans mom. Many of the movies in that list wont be covered in my thread because I am focusing on human femalesprincesses. Theres a lot to talk about  and I am narrowing my focus on Snow White  Cinderella  Sleeping Beauty  Little Mermaid  Beauty and The Beast  Aladdin  Pocahontas  Hercules  Mulan and Tarzan. ,RedPillWives,dazhks9,6,t5_3ddkr

10056683,0,t3_5jripc,Ill be honest nothing comes to mind for me on this. My husband is laid back and isnt particularly demanding and doesnt really do or ask for anything that I find challenging so maybe thats part of it. I dont know if this counts but I find travelling and going on holiday makes me anxious and I wouldnt do it if I was on my own but my husband loves it so I take part too. Thats more of a case of me countering my desires then my needs though. In that case I just get on with it and try to do things that reduce my anxiety such as having a list and doing some planning in advance. In terms of the bonus question I think thats tricky but I think a good rule would be understanding the difference between being yielding and being a doormat and only doing this for a man who respects your sacrifice. By respect I dont mean I expect the man in the question to be grovelling with thanks but you dont want a man who just uses you or takes advantage without any gratitude at all. There is also balance if you are the one giving everything in the relationship thats a sign that its going wrong in my opinion. ,RedPillWives,dbies2s,3,t5_3ddkr

But I definitely agree that a lot of millennials today end up looking like lesbians just as a lot of guys end up looking really gay!

10493802,0,t3_5q9tje,This is obviously something that varies couple to couple but for us it was a very gradual and gentle fade. I chose to wait until marriage for sex and I believe there is something about the discipline and pentup sexual energy of waiting that carries you very far in a marriage. Our honeymoon phase lasted a very long time and as it gradually wore off it left in its place a quieter and deeper love. Like ulittleeggwyf said I have no doubt that I love my husband far more now than I did when I married him...it has been tested and tried and proven for over  years now. Hes quite the romantic type and Im a bit addicted to him so to speak so we have frequent flashbacks to the giddy infatuation of that first year of marriage. As fun and thrilling as the honeymoon phase is it ending is not a bad thing. Living like that forever would be exhausting on many levels I think.

10726240,0,t3_5tghaf,gtAs the pictures and footage surfaced it became clear that the feminism of the Womens March was a grotesque caricature of its origins. This was not Susan B. Anthonys party. What were once ERA picket lines became cries of Free Palestine. What was once the  Iranian protest by women against hijabs became Americanflag hijabs on placards hoisted high. It was pussyhats and the cword and abortion on demand and female genitalia on our faces. How egalitarian!    I think this article is quite interesting because its the first time that Ive heard someone point the finger at intersectional feminism as the reason why the current feminist movement is so insufferable.  years ago in a gender studies class in college yes...I know... we did a unit on intersectionality. Basically its adding a few qualifiers onto the fact that a woman is a woman. Like I cant just be a girl I must be a college educated cisfemale girl who is from an upper class socioeconomic background. But it never seemed like something that was being pushed heavily.    Flash forward to today and you cannot just be a woman. You must add all those extra labels onto it. Things almost seem as cliquey as a high school cafeteria. Women are facing some very serious issues around the world right now but everyone is so focused on intersectionality that no one is bothering to help them out. I havent considered myself a feminist since  but I have huge amounts of respect for the suffragette movement and honestly I think they would be ashamed about what feminism has turned into. ,RedPillWives,ddmbycl,8,t5_3ddkr

10781601,0,t1_ddryvze,Your first point I understand.The second point Im still not wrapping me head around. Its because of internalized ideas about the roles of men and women that dads get flack guilty until proven innocent. If women adhere to gender roles it makes dads overstepping that gender role even more egregiously out of the norm and therefore suspect no?,RedPillWives,dds1l1r,1,t5_3ddkr
10813488,0,t3_5unbtl,I wander over to other subs occasionally and Ive found that since BP people dont like the idea of RP they really like to frame RP people as monsters. This is a good example of what I mean. He could not fathom that a woman would choose to follow a strong leader and he kept insisting that I was second LOL! All of his comments on that post were trying to force RP to admit that they abused their power because he truly believes that if a man leads his marriage that man will start beating his wife black and blue and hold her hostage against her will.

11003911,0,t3_5x3egd,Ive been both a sahw and a sahm. I love it. I usually wake up around  and nurse my little one then when my hubby gets up at  I go wake my older children up. I make lunches the night before and also make sure everyones clothes are laid out the night before to make the morning run much more smoothly. I give the kids and hubby breakfast I never eat that early and get all the kids dressed and ready for the bus. Walk them down and get home and get started on cleaning. I usually clean one section of house a day bedrooms living room etc. so it takes me less than an hour and I never have to do much deep cleaning. I put a load of laundry on and empty the dishwasher and sweep downstairs. Two dogs make for a lot of fur. Then its snack time and nurse time for my younger ones so we sit and watch PBS for half an hour or so. Then I get down on the floor to play with them. Lunch rolls around and I put something simple together like meat cheese and cut up fruits and veggies. This is also when I put any crockpot suppers in so theyll be done when hubs gets home. I let them run around for another hour and then its nap time and I sit and have tea and enjoy the silence. Then its time to walk down to the bus stop and we all play outside until about  when I head in to make supper. Hubby gets home we eat then he helps big girl with her homework and I clean the kitchen  make tomorrows lunches and feed the dogs and the mouse. I give baths and hand out pajamas brush their hair and help brush their teeth and either I or hubby reads them a story and do their bedtime prayers with them. If he does it he usually sings to them I dont because I dont want to scare them haha. Then we relax together and enjoy books a movie or just talking. About twice a week I take a hot bubble bath and read a book in there to unwind. Whew!,RedPillWives,def9fqa,3,t5_3ddkr

11264561,0,t3_60pmpp,I totally almost forgot about gratituesday even though I had a serious think about it yesterday. Its been a week full of gratitude so far!!   I am so so SO grateful that hubs and I are on the same schedule this week. Being able to spend time with him while he is awake has been incredible.  Im incredibly grateful to have wonderful friends. Hubs was pushing hard to get his project finished over the weekend and my very new car started having transmission issues had some wonderful friends to not only save me but also towtake a look at it. Didnt even have to tell hubs about it until after it was dealt with and so he didnt even have to stress a single bit! so grateful for my wonderful dogs. This one might sound silly to some but they really are what keeps me going when its just me a lot of the time and it was so awesome to play with them with hubs tonight. They just have such a way of keeping things in perspective!!For the bonus I Love Summer! I dont handle the Michigan cold too well so being able to get outside and enjoy the sunshine is awesome to me! ,RedPillWives,df8tl6h,2,t5_3ddkr

11528749,0,t3_64dsse,Your boyfriend obviously has a huge need to save women and you are a selfproclaimed lesser alpha that is not in need of saving. Maybe in the future you can let him be your hero more often.As far as him importing another woman into your relationship that is something you will have to figure out as it progresses and determine exactly how much you want to share your man with another woman. The problem is that he loves being the hero and women get emotionally attached to their heroes. ,RedPillWives,dg2salx,2,t5_3ddkr

11682980,0,t1_dgk9p91,I totally agree. Additionally there are a multitude of ways to run a household. The way I see it as small businesses often have an office manager who might do some clerical work accountingpayroll even handle light janitorial work. the OMs job will be kinda different from office to office depending on the type size and culture of the work environment  this is the same for homemakers. I handle ALL the day to day finances. But other homemakers do not touch finances as their husband does those. and then there are wives who split the financial tasks with their partner. Each relationship has different reasons to do it the way they do. So how do you define success when you are looking at a totally different environment for your metrics? Youll fail when you do that every time. ,RedPillWives,dgka6rx,3,t5_3ddkr
11716401,0,t1_dgo1v17,Our relationship started as something casual on and off more sexual than anything honestly. But then over time my anxiety lessened he got more motivated and we found we enjoyed each others company and have fun together and had similar life values which over time have changed but luckily we have grown together instead of our views growing apart. When we met we didnt want children very liberal... as we get older we both want a family now and have grown more conservative for example. I mean there were hiccups along the way but then we moved in together and got engaged and were a lot more stable. At this point of course its a lot more than just the initial why did we start dating because there were many things over the years that brought us closer and closer. Now were deeply in love and share that bond.. I guess after getting everything off my chest in my post I realize weve just been through a lot of hardship together. Living with mental illness sucks. Sometimes it just feels like one hurdle after another. Sometimes I leave myself wondering if Im causing him this pain.. if hes causing me this pain.. and I know he wonders the same. Im on medication for my anxiety and I dont work as hard at managing it as I should but living with a depressed partner is hard. On both of us  Like I said hes been diagnosed PTSD and shows every symptom but just shrugs it off and says well I was never in a war. I know I cant help him unless he wants to help himself and I know sometimes I make things harder on him especially with my own anxiety. But theres lots of things I fell in love with him for things that I still love about him and theres things Ive grown to love. Unfortunately depression dulls everything about you and my anxiety heightens my bad qualities so its rough sometimes. ,RedPillWives,dgo306d,2,t5_3ddkr
11752821,0,t3_67pmdw,My biggest tip?  Plan ahead.  Get as much done before hand as you can.  If you do it all that day you are going to be very tired and not enjoy yourself. My second biggest tip?  As much as possible dont stress about this.  The more you stress the harder this is going to be. Also the less fun you will have and then less your guests will be comfortable.  Keep a notebook for what did work and what didnt work.  Keep recipes and tips for yourself in there so for the next one you can just pull it out as a reminder.  Keep recipes you have collected in there for storage as well. Other than that when is it?  ,RedPillWives,dgs7mtc,9,t5_3ddkr
