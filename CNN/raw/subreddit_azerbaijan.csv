7186221,0,t3_4dwprh,Interesting parallel to another video posted showing Armenian troops walking on the south side of the village. Assuming this is not a photoop they are probably planting this on northern side of the village where both sides have confirmed Azeri military presence. We dont see any sign of village structures in the video though. ,azerbaijan,d1v0f4a,4,t5_2s8kv

7838089,0,t1_d3wx7ow,Can you at least link good sources for what you claim ? From the map alone I cant calculate the number of Azeris.You claim that some of the poll was  years ago but the title of the map says .Following your second link I get maximum M other Turkic people in Iran when you claim at least  million.I found this as evidence for your claim on Iran   in both cases resulting in the immediate firing of the author of the offending stuff Overall though it seems fine,azerbaijan,d3x2hk5,1,t5_2s8kv

10421821,0,t1_dcp9wqt,You seriously dont see a difference between parading around a severed head and taking a photo of casualties in a truck that were then transported back to Azerbaijan? Bull. Shit. In the video the Armenian merely states where and how the azeris were killed. No mockery. No parading around. No desecration.  Dont sit there and tell that if an Armenian pulled an Azeris head out of plastic bag and held it up high for everyone to see and celebrate that you would equate that to an Azeri filming a truck of dead armenians that werent even half naked.,azerbaijan,dcpds7o,-1,t5_2s8kv
