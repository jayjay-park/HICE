8913484,0,t1_d7j3975,KazumaOh well sure. Id be fine with that.Kazuma wasnt usually a shy person so hed have no problem accepting the young womans invitation. Though he was a bit curious about where she came from. As they start walking Kazumas not entire sure what to look for. He figures wherever has smoke or steam coming out of it is a good place to start.So where are you from?He was a bit curious about the woman. Her manner of speaking and her way of dress were interesting to see. Perhaps they had to do with why she was all the way out here.,GLRP_NorthBlue,d7j9qms,1,t5_3fq5c
8922461,0,t1_d7k7lo9,ValentineGiggling would be a sight unbecoming of many men mostly because the implication of sillyness. One would think that a man dressed as the rider does not care for that.He he heOne would be right.Oh honey ya cant call the beautifull smell of stew rotten! Here.The old living of cooking never really takes a toll in the soul you could cook your whole life like the old lady from the east attending this stall has but you would be smiling from ear to ear just as well.Letsa try this one.And thus dismounting from a proud mare one more client comes to ingest the funny lookingsmellingtastingcooked meat in todays menu.,GLRP_NorthBlue,d7kckop,1,t5_3fq5c
8936374,0,t1_d7kxzk9,ShiiraShiira looks at him a bit of confusion and curiosity in her eyes.Perfume? Whats that?She deduces that it had to be some sort of fragrant mixture from what he described. They didnt have those things at the bottom of the sea.Well people are saying that theres a map to One Piece in there. I dont really believe that the treasure itself exists and the map is probably fake even if its actually in there but theres probably other things in the pyramid too.,GLRP_NorthBlue,d7m0qg8,1,t5_3fq5c
8960150,0,t1_d7orlkw,KazumaOh well thank you then.Taking the card from the young lady he looked it over and started walking away. What an odd event...,GLRP_NorthBlue,d7ovj8h,1,t5_3fq5c
9022384,0,t3_53rfp6,Einfaldur UlfurUlfur was roaming around town looking for a way to earn his keep. He was still wandering around when  a signboard caught his interest. It was placed just outside a shop and he could see some cool trinkets inside. Ooh that looks like some unusual stuff... Ah crap I cant blow off any of my money I need to save it upgt he thought to himself walking away from the shop. Just then he heard a melody coming from the alley between the shop and another buildingA hooded figure walked out of the alley repeating the same song. Thats probably who was singing in theregt he guessed as he saw the man step outside.,GLRP_NorthBlue,d7wcl63,1,t5_3fq5c
9272471,0,t3_52hn4f,NeroThe coalcovered night reflected all its light away from the surface. It only let in lunar light to its crippled island. Nero searched for something to do not a surprise. He wandered the fringes of the island before running into Dodolas trails again. Once more Nero walked the path leading to the town.When Nero arrived he found a new building he hadnt once observed. It was an arena that clouded his dark blue colored sight. Then a interest developed in his head. It postulated into cysts of intrigue. He needed to either distract himself from these cysts or treat them. Nero decided the latter as it was much more timeconsuming. He approached the archway leading to entering the arena.Nero waited for an opponent to approach him. If no one would come to him he would simply leave or watch a fight but the intrigue inside his brain grew too compulsive. He wanted to fight someone worth fighting. While he waited wonderfully he found the area for training before fights. Nero decided to grab this opportunity to get himself prepared for any fighters willing to challenge him. He entered the room covered in old rags covering the beat up walls. The dummys were made of hay which stunk almost to the magnitude of the island. Each mannequin was fitted with leather armor from head to toe for resistance. There were also punching bags nearly releasing themselves from agonizing pain. The pain that stressed their chainlinked ropes holding themselves to the ceiling writhed in pain. Nero valiantly unsheathed his beautiful ironforged Falcatas.Nero spoke to himself in his mind as he practiced his dual swordplay. He dashed towards the first dummy with haste and acted with succeeding precision. Nero swinged each Falcata perpendicular to each other following it with him turning  clockwise to gain momentum. As momentum built up he finally released it upon reaching three quarters around and he slashed downwards with both swords from above his head. The marks that were left nearly scarred the hay inside the dummy. There were three vertical parallel slashes and one long horizontal slash at the bottom near the belly button. Nero continued to slash at the dummy trying to perform new attacking patterns. After about four minutes he fell tired. Hay had finally begun hurling out of the dummys intestinal area. Nero sat down to regain his strength. Suddenly something caught his eye. It was a huge long barrelchested sack of leather. He stared at the hanging punching bag before acting on it. He got up from his sitting wiping his sweat from his forehead. Nero made both haycovered swords parallel to each other and coinciding. He proceeded to dash straight towards the punching bag to lacerate it with the combination of both his Falcatas. Upon contact Nero tried to force the Falcatas inside the punching bag as much as he could. Luckily with the assistance of his speed he had some success. He ran past the bag bringing his swords to his body to sheathe them again. Once more Nero sat down. This time he didnt get back up to continue training instead he went outside the training area to wait for an opponent.,GLRP_NorthBlue,d8rcp22,1,t5_3fq5c
9763358,0,t1_dagfp2z,VorrakkThat would be... Kaigun town right? Thanks.He turned around and headed out of the square.I didnt know that. But it wouldnt make sense for my character to give up now so Ill continue trying.,GLRP_NorthBlue,dagjukv,1,t5_3fq5c
9792142,0,t1_dai0f1s,PlotTheres always someone better than you yknow kids?ggThe man speaks shortly before being kicked in the head by Shiira and then having his pistol taken away from him like a kid. Though it wasnt like hed be able to use it by now he wouldnt even be able to move his body. He sighs with nowhere else to look but up he starts playing around with his teeth.That goes for me to. Well. Sayanara kids.ggA loud audible crunch can be heard as foam starts fizzing from the mans mouth. Within seconds the man was no longer of the world dead by suicide. Silence followed soon after only to be broken again this time by the sound of a den den mushi ringing.Purupurupurupuruunck,GLRP_NorthBlue,dak3eb3,1,t5_3fq5c
9843245,0,t1_daqbf6d,Einfaldur UlfurJust as before the guy didnt seem too chatty. Guess hes just not too fond of talking to strangers most people dont tend to be anyways.gt Ulfur thought.gt Yes Im heading to Matumba to see if its true or not. My name? Oh its Kazuma.Well then Kazuma...gc he said trying to pronounce his name after him Hopefully it wont turn out to be a bust like the pyramid back there.gc He glanced back at Dodola as they set sail.He walked to the rails and bent over looking at the sea for a while. A smile appeared on his face as he realised that he had always wanted this and now it was a reality. However he wouldnt get to savour this feeling for long. His thoughts were broken by the Captains announcement.gt Ah nuts.. Pirates..Everybody just uh.. yeah just give em whatever they as for. No point losing lives of something as stupid as money.gtHe turned around to see that the ship was quite close to them. He shouldve been more aware especially while travelling rather than spend his time daydreaming. But the Captains advice did seem sound now. The Ferry had innocents on it and if they refused and fought back at least a few would end up dead. Besides he didnt even have much money.Cursing his luck beneath his breath he dropped his bag and began to see how much he had left when the Captain of the Pirates shouted out pretty much what he would have expected for a raid. But at the end he pointed at him and Kazuma and said gt cept these two jokers. Handsome nd Pink air. Just because yer faces rub me tha wrong way.aaWell now that fighting would be inevitable at least Ulfur didnt have to give up his money. It would best to fight on their ship so that the civilians wouldnt get hurt and the Ferry wont be damaged.He tried to copy the pirates way of talking and walked over to the side where theyre ship was saying Ayy Matey whats your problem?gc he jumped and climbed onto their ships deck. Cant stand anyone goodlookin? That explains yer face.gcHe drew both the ChainScythes from his sides pulled up his hood and began his attack without wasting any time. He attacked the grunts standing in front of him first before making his way towards the Captain. Since he was cornered between the helm and Ulfur he attacked him with a barrage of attacks Blade FurygcNameBlade Fury Branches from Double StrikeRank Cost Style GatlingRange ShortDescriptionUlfur holds his weapons by the handle instead of the chains and unleashes a hail of slashes on the enemy. uDamie,GLRP_NorthBlue,daqlj99,1,t5_3fq5c
