2450408,0,t1_cmehd25,It was never meant to work in the background and it was breaking the app for some. I will put it back and add a setting for it in the next update. Im working on a profile system to do the multiple acctlocation thing.,yabrb,cmeko7t,1,t5_34lwt

3166625,0,t3_2wcn40,Feature Request?Can it be possible make it so that when the DO ALL button is pressed that each account can run a predefined period of time like  AM and then another at  AM? I really think this would help make it even more automated to where all one has to do in the morning is begin the do all process and throughout the day the app launches and does searches and then closes. I tried setting this up via tasker and using a timer app whose alarmtimer notification would be intercepted to open the app and virtually touch the do all button for each individual account,yabrb,coq7wnh,3,t5_34lwt

I was rather hoping for that functionality but it doesnt work on Marshmallow.All I want to do is switch away do something and come back and have it still going. Could you at least save the current state playing or stopped and have it use that state when you return to the app? This would only apply if it wasnt killed.,yabrb,d03vi7x,1,t5_34lwt
