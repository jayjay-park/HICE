1138933,0,t3_275otw,For rental companies Grants Pass Property Management has been reliable. For gun shops theres Fox Firearms and Cash Connection a pawn shop. Im certain that Fox is not hiring but Cash Connection might be. In the banking jobs First Community seems to constantly hiring and has really nice people working at it.The biggest problem youll find in Merlin is water supply. There are quite a few areas with not very productive wells so keep an eye out for that. If you like Merlin you should also look on the south side at MurphyWilliamsApplegateProvolt. For the most part Cave Junction is nice but there are some pretty big issues with the lack of law enforcement. Around here Cave Junction is the source of most toothlessuncledad jokes.If you think of any other questions feel free to ask.,grantspass,chxqoj6,2,t5_2smjm

I was up near there Wednesday afternoon since we have had a couple people call about her in that area though the last one said she was near the end of the trail on Hieglen Loop off of Woodbrook where that gravel road leads up to I think the reservoir. I was thinking about heading up there this afternoon after work maybe I will start up near Starlight then. If you manage to spot her feel free to give me a call or shoot memy fiance a text. Mine is the second number on the missing posters my fiance posted all over the area.,grantspass,cr2hfsf,1,t5_2smjm
