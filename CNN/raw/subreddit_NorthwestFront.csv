1983751,0,t1_ckqutt0,Yes that would be a very good start Cutting the bribery. Since that is what campaign finance really is legalized bribery.  In effect it is auctioning of our public offices to those with the deepest pockets. This cannot be good for the ethical order of a society since it turns all public service into a race to stuff ones pockets to repay ones donors and sponsors.  Ideally we would elect individual people based on their ideas and ability ... but that would be a hard change from our current system which glorifies not only dishonor but encourages people to have NO strong personal platform or ideas. ,NorthwestFront,cks8qph,1,t5_2tgqx

I myself dont give that much of a shit  as long as you arent a nigger spick dune coon or a TOTAL kike youre fine with me.  As for your bit of Japanese ancestry that just makes you likely to have a slightly higher IQ and any white who has a problem with that is a damn fool.,NorthwestFront,cxef8no,3,t5_2tgqx
