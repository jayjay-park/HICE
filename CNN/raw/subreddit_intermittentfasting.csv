Yes many people use IF as a way to restrict calories but others eat at maintenance on IF for the various benefits of fasting e.g. higher HGH.  You can get your macros doing one meal per day.  IF is just about WHEN you eat and if having a narrow feeding window helps her control binge eating there is no reason to discourage it.

8263568,0,t3_4sjl7r,Going to add to this with a separate reply.    You clearly have no logical idea what the ketogenic diet is about.  Because a well formulated ketogenic diet does not advocate lean meats. Healthy fat is critical.   On a ketogenic diet you have a proteintarget based on your training body dimensions etc you keep carbs below a certain absolute level say g and then everything else is fat.    But yes I mess around with Ketogenic eating ....     chance you were not even close to being in ketosis. Havent heard of many ketogenic dieters putting away  Hagen Dazs bars. Dr Stephen Phinney states that it can take up to a week for your body to get back into ketosis if you do something like Hagen Dazs bars i.e. moderate to high refined carbs.    So I am going to suggest that before you run around illogically and randomly blaming things that you do some proper reading and research first.    ,intermittentfasting,d5ai506,3,t5_2tluu

I would suggest you looking up some of the great Iron Man athletes and use their diets. Several of them were vegetarianketo they werent eating lots of meat and a few green leafy veggies. They were loading up with coconut oil olive oil nut butters bacon powders and avocado smoothies where it is easy to get calorie requirements. However these were not big guys. They were lean. I dont think anyone can recommend a strategy to you if you havent developed some measurable goals of your own. It seems more like you are just following what others have done in several popular subreddits who probably have entirely different goals than you. ,intermittentfasting,devnyfv,1,t5_2tluu

Yesterday I managed  cals for my first day on a  plan and I went to bed a little hungry but didnt wake up particularly hungry. For my ideal weight Id rather be a muscular .

11475814,0,t3_63rqg8,Ive had similar worries and the one thing I will suggest for certain is to get blood work done on occasion if youre really concerned.   Ive done so on a few occasions and I havent noticed any discernible differences in the results so at the moment Im just taking most of my supplements d k B complex creatine with my first meal and the rest fish oil magnesium with my last meal. Try not to overthink it too much eat a varied and nutrient dense diet and your supplements will act as an insurance for peace of mind ,intermittentfasting,dfws281,2,t5_2tluu
11480378,0,t3_63oz7w,Also know that if you decide to try a particular ratio    whatever  you arent locked into it forever. Ive been doing IF since Dec  and Ive probably tried four or five different ratios of fasting to feasting to see what works best for me my schedule and my body. Its also not uncommon to do certain ratios during the week and others on the weekend when we tend to be more social. Itll just take time to figure it all out.,intermittentfasting,dfxaqdi,3,t5_2tluu

11532304,0,t3_64lmjy,You do realize that NIBP can be NOTORIOUSLY wrong? If you dont line up your artery in your arm just right with those pieces of shit you can be off by up to  mmHG.  Which is a treatment decision in my old world paramedicine.  You sound like youve been good at lining it up though.  As for your low blood pressure let me tell you something.  Blood pressure is unique to the individual and actions.  Meaning that a normal pressure is  but thats just a benchmark. Peoples normal can be higher or lower than that.  BP is flexible and spikes are good for you the problems are when it doesnt come down.  When you exercise your bp would be easily   systolicFor your friends to tell you its way too low means your friends are fat out of shape fucks trying to make themselves feel better about themselves.  As long as you dont feel tired faint have problems standing up quickly youre fine. Your brain requires at least  systolic to get blood up your neck and your radial pulse is around .    Anything between  is good.    Also the diastolic bottom number is the pressure left over in your blood vessels after the ventricular contractions.   So the top number can be high the bottom number should stay low.  Tldr provided you dont feel like shit  youre fine.  If you do feel like shit maybe eat more salt ,intermittentfasting,dg36t12,3,t5_2tluu

What works best for one may not be what works best for someone else. I find the  best for me because thats what keeps me within my macros. It also fits my worklife schedule best and I do better with a consistent schedule.I cant seem to keep things together any other way but there are folks who can and do better on another schedule.,intermittentfasting,dgarejm,1,t5_2tluu

11674308,0,t3_66j481,I dont actually do IF but I do lift shortly after waking every morning at am and have thus not eaten since pm the previous night. I eat half an apple before my workout as I feel the carb boost helps me wake up and get some energy. As well I take BCAAs during my  hour workout and a water based whey shake afterwards. If I were to go IF Id simply not have the apple and not have the post workout shake as the research indicating a benefit to having macronutrients directly post workout is hazy.I cant workout within  hours of eating any meal more than a granola bar or an apple and within  hours of a heavy meal. Ymmv but I anecdotally find fasted workouts much better as your body devotes all energy to working out rather than metabolism.,intermittentfasting,dgjary2,1,t5_2tluu
