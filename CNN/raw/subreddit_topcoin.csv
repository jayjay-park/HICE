458013,0,t3_1zbtdg,Such a pity.  Jareth the Goblin King Labyrinth  Sorry to see that you are losing hope in the coin.  I know youve been around since day  as I have been too and remember reading a few of your posts.  I guess my view differs...  leans more toward the bull side of things.  Perhaps Im a little more optimistic because of what I have seen in this community...  and am still somewhat dumb to the actual currency aspect of it all.  Of course as you suggested the thrill of possibly striking it rich crosses every single one of our minds...  Im no exception.  When I discovered TopCoin I dove right in...  Mining was fun for once as I happened across it early enough to create a nice pile.  I have dumped ZERO of my coins on the exchanges.  I donated and donated and donated and donated some more.  I saw others doing the same.  A different aspect from many of the other miners Im sure...  they would mine sell mine sell...  Instead I went to work trying to offer my skills to the coin and the community.  The coin really does belong to all of us in the end and it is what we make of it.  Sure topdude calls most of the shots but he has said before that he is leaving most of the decisions up to the community.  Any time the coin has been questioned hes been there to answer and defend the coin.  If it was a scam coin dont you think he would have poofed by now?  If more services and options to spend TOP start popping up do you think it still faces the same fate?  Seems kind of dumpproof at that point to me anyway.  If we build the right image and give more and more options to TOP holders interest will grow organically and well be just fine.  Yeah it can be as shaky as the next coin but you said it yourself...  this whole cryptocurrency thing can easily fall apart if we continue misusing it i.e. pump and dumps.  I vow to try and make this coin into something everyone can trust and enjoy using.  Ill be mining when the blocks are down to .  I will be putting in work wherever I can to help grow the coins utility and if in the long run I was wrong...  then so be it.  I can live with that because at least I know I gave it a shot.  Perhaps we can even develop something even more unique for the coin itself...  I code for a living so if I get familiar with it enough I will also vow to try and bring some of the ideas I have floating around in my head to life.  In closing I want to thank you for your honesty and I fully respect your opinion.  It is good to have these different views to learn from one another.  Oh and in jest why did you have to poo all over my scavenger hunt?  crymzyn,topcoin,cfsbpzj,3,t5_304zf
