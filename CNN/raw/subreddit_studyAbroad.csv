765655,0,t3_22vwdq,I studied abroad in Glasgow but visited both Edinburgh and Dublin.  In general I enjoyed Edinburgh more.  Im not saying Dublin was bad definitely not but when I visited Dublin we went for a weekend and by the time we needed to leave I was okay with going back home.  Whereas we went to Edinburgh three times and I still didnt see everything and would have gone back again if I had more time.The only downside that I can think of is that Edinburgh was a lot more touristy busy than Dublin but that could depend on what parts of each city you were going to be in  I dont know if it would be less touristy near where the University is.,studyAbroad,cgrb6mg,2,t5_2s8bd

I think you do need the COE in order to apply but it shouldnt take too long and I recently learned that you can mail them via express mail only to the consulate so that you dont have to worry about making a trip out to them if theyre not near you.

1830860,0,t3_2fi2u9,There was a rule in my college that they have to include a document explaining that their way of calculating GPA usually deflates the numbers compared to other colleges that have policies supporting inflated GPAs. In other words a . in my college has more value that a . in another college. Of course different majors have different GPA expectations and sometimes you can petition if your GPA is below the required. Also. Talk to your advisors and your college counsel. Try yo score a number of recommendation letters. I hope you have a good CV with extracurriculars and activities. Also email professors there and be a little nosey. You can make it work.Anyway before you do all that think thoroughly why you want to move there. Why now? Are there subconscious reasons? Are you just bored? Be honest to yourself and talk with friends and family for their points of views.I wish you all the best.,studyAbroad,ck9t8g5,1,t5_2s8bd

Then if not I would look up actual German colleges online and see what their policies are as to accepting American students.

2995991,0,t1_co8fpvw,Malm is a nice small city it has enough to keep you interested but if you what something new then Copenhagen is only kms away! Top things to see in Malm would be Turning Torso Malmhus Castle Malm Konsthall Moderna Museet and Folkets Park in the warmer months. I am really enjoying my time in Lund its a very vibrant student time where there are so many things to do but I like that Malm is so close and Copenhagen as well. They also have trains running all night from Copenhagen to Lund so you can live in Lund where it is cheaper but still go out in bigger cities. ,studyAbroad,co8j64h,1,t5_2s8bd
3358916,0,t3_2ymtus,I was quite lucky and actually graduated a semester early. I qualified for financial aid so I took  units for free during the summer which allowed me to complete one class for my major English and one class for my minor Music before I went abroad. I was also allowed to count two upperdivision courses outside of my home university as electives for my major so getting my abroad courses approved was really easy.It isnt always easy for other students to graduate on time after studying abroad for lots of reasons their majors might require classes to be taken on the home campus certain courses might only be available once a year there are simply more requirements their host university might just be a culture program and not an immersion program with courses relevant to their major etc.,studyAbroad,cpb53nt,1,t5_2s8bd
4018838,0,t3_35pbjm,Sometimes. It depends on the policies of your university and where youd like to study abroad. Larger schools with lots of international students like the University of Glasgow have a system to admit students from outside of their exchange programs. Small schools with few international students like my undergrad college do not and thus you wouldnt be able to study there without an exchange program in place with your school.But just because you can doesnt mean you should. Funding can get tricky you may be ineligible for certain types of financial aid and have to finance most of the trip yourself Univeristy of Sydney says if youre studying independently youre ineligible for HECSHelp or FEEHelp. Credits may or may not transfer properly. Youll have to arrange housinghealth caretransporationcourse registationetc. on your own. Its pretty messy. My college US did not have any exchange programs so I ended up enrolling in another colleges program for the semester so Id still be eligible for aidso Id have educational support services. My home school ended up completely screwing up my credits enrollment fees... I had to fix it all when I returned. But YMMV and maybe youd be luckier.,studyAbroad,credmbu,1,t5_2s8bd

5083557,0,t1_cuyci6m,gt but someone mentioned that bachelors degrees from Germany arent even viable if I were to return to the U.S. Depends upon the degree in question and upon your potential employers. Imagine it this way an employer in the USA has to choose between two applicants both US citizens both same age sex colour both recent graduates. One graduated from a US university the other from a German university. Chances are high the employer will pick the one from the US university because this is what he knows. In some cases also the degree is not easily transferable. Easily comparable degreeswork experiences are languages lit degrees business management being a chefhotel manager. But anything that is strictly regulated by the government or specialised locally is tricky.  For example a degree in German law will be almost useless in the USA because the laws are completely different. Additionally there are the rules for practising law the government has put in place  like the bar exam. Medicine is also complicated to transfer  if you graduate from a German university and pass the Staatsexamen federal administered exam you are allowed to practise medicine in Germany. But in other countries the rules for becoming a medical professional are different. Inside the EU the governments have been working on getting their degrees recognised and youll usually only have to retake certain exams or pass certain tests. But in other countries it can easily be that you have to start over again. Educate yourself on these rules before you start studying. What does it take to turn a German Staatsexamen into a US license to practise medicine? Consider doing a year abroad instead of a full degree. All in all most people who do a full degree in Germany intend to stay in Germany after they graduate. They usually have some other reasons for studying in Germany than just tuition free uni. The majority are people who are married to Germans plan to get married to a German or have relatives in Germany already. I know of one case where a woman had a very rare disease with severe health issues she studied in Germany and planned to stay in Germany after graduation because the only specialist for her disease was in Germany and because of the healthcare in Germany. Healthcare she would not have been able to afford while living in the US. ,studyAbroad,cuyrg41,1,t5_2s8bd

8969893,0,t3_534tfj,gt I have a quick question on if college in Europe is less expensive because of my Icelandc citizenship.Most schools dont take fees from EU or EEA citizens.gt I want to studying computer sciences programming and want to go someone in Europe to study.Computer Science is the  course thought in Englishgt want to go someone in Europe to study. Not sure where to goI guess Norway or Denmark is not considered Europe by your standards? Norway or Denmark is very easy if you are nervous about going far. If you want an adventure then go to central Europe or Balkan.Id vouch for Germany they have lots of high ranked science colleges and universities. Plus you learn the language at school right? The cost of living is normal. Go to the Balkan if you want to live well on Icelandic student loan  the Erasmus scholarship.Edit You consistently write someone any person when you mean somewhere any place. ,studyAbroad,d7q1mu6,1,t5_2s8bd
9809063,0,t1_d9vy7zw,Sorry for the very late response Renegonzalez For this I will assume youre a U.S citizen. I myself am a college student and the program I am going through Megellan Exchange They require me to have a . GPA as part of the minimum qualifications however I had a . when I applied and a . right now. Im unsure if you can just apply to Magellan as a high school student but in case I read your post wrong I will also answer it this way. They dont care of high school grades as long as you have some college grades and GPA.If you are in high school still then there are some international universities such as Temple which have universities from Japan to Germany and the U.S which asked for a . I believe.If you are in college right now you could also ask your study abroadinternational coordinators about if they have their own system and what their requirements are.Overall it is easy to get into Germany as a student though the pain comes from the registration for visas residency permits and getting setup here. That is what eats your money but once youre setup everything is easy sailing and cheap.Hope this helps mate!,studyAbroad,dam6dy8,2,t5_2s8bd
