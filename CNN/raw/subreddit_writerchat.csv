Since knowing its a beast lets us wonder what type of beast could be that powerful without the confusion of what is it.It should be noted that part pulls me out from the text saying okay do i need a pen and paper now it sounds like a teacher addressing a class to takes notes when reviewing the book. overall it doesnt fit into the text which breaks the immersion. So with the suggestion i made you keep the same meaning without telling the reader.That makes sense with the Shadow Weavers if they all came from the same school and then disperse into different units. But there were still a few Weavers in that one attack so jumping to the correct one felt a little too convenient. So a rephrasing it to indicate which Weaver Fourblade was taking about would help The Shadow Weaver I was just talking to do you know him? or can have BurningWind ask for clarification like Which SW sir the one you were just talking to was ...Its fine having a false name but i would venture on something completely generic since Snufflebunny draws too much attention and feels out of place in the grim world youve set up.When I think of a secret prison i think of isolation meaning that everyone there is there on purpose and doesnt have a history of soldiering through other conflitcs. So when u mention all the units and campaigns that the men have come from like Burningwinds MezzoMingen part it makes me wonder if the prison is that secret if there are units that should be fighting suddenly at a prison. It makes it feel more like a basecampfort where you would see other units passing through instead of a secret prison for cold war prisoners.hopefully that clears things up.,writerchat,d75vqn3,1,t5_3cuug
8834342,0,t1_d79khcr,I see my question was misread or rather I didnt word my situation or questions correctly. I wasnt meaning that I thought I was getting rejected because of who I am but rather almost  of the agents I found were specifically asking for work from women or POC and as such I didnt submit to them just as I wouldnt submit my novel to a picture book publisher. So when I am looking on agentquery for SciFi agents reading that over half of them are looking for The female Tolkien or The African American George Martin tells me that I have even less of a chance of getting looked at then I would by other agents.I have read through all of Janet Reids stuff on query shark and have even submitted a query of my own to be looked at. I personalize each query No Dear Agent I have edited and revised the base query more times than the novel itself at this point. I understand that sometimes it is just wrong time wrong place and I also understand that what I have written doesnt follow the trends that I know of. I have a difficult sale I know that. But it just feels much worse to read on every other agents bio that they are searching for works by people I am not just because I wasnt born that way.As for the second question I just meant other resources to find agents not trying to scam new authors as I have exhausted agentquery as of last week.,writerchat,d79ri5o,2,t5_3cuug

And its not magic. Hes just done it soo many times that it feels like magic. Theres a clear method that works for him and works for his readers. Everyone just needs to figure out their method  particularly one that plays to their strengths.,writerchat,d7d3xv6,1,t5_3cuug

9358869,0,t1_d92992i,MiloWestwards question about young agents may be key.  It seems that if a more senior agent in the industry say one with thirty years and strong personal relationships within the big publishing houses decided to take on a book that another agent had dropped my feeling is she could get anyone to take her call and revisit that book if she deemed it worthy of a second look.So the question then changes from does this ever happen to could this happen for me. The Devil is not the only one that hides in the details.,writerchat,d92ayon,2,t5_3cuug

10969354,0,t1_deal1ul,Im confused by this because I have no idea who the POV is. I guess it could be omniscient but then youre going to need to establish a narrative voice right away because at the moment Im thinking theres a yetunmentioned protagonist already sitting in the room and witnessing this. If thats not the case then give me the protagonist right away. Name whichever of those two men it is instead of calling them the boy and the priest so I can attach myself to one of them instead of hanging out here in the cinematic POV void. If it is the case well same advice. Give me the POV in the first line if at all possible.,writerchat,debetln,1,t5_3cuug

For exampleJames felt scared as he entered the conference room.vs.James heart thundered in his chest as his eyes darted from one corner of the conference room to the other and he could feel his palms sweating as he introduced himself to the other attendees.,writerchat,dg75sxg,1,t5_3cuug
