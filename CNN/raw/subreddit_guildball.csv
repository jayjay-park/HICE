5434841,0,t1_cw6axud,Pretty much. Two beaty teams beating on each other can make for interesting games  dont get me wrong. But if thats your only experience youre going to miss out on a lot of what makes GB really interesting.On the other hand Brisket on the Butchers and the SpigotFriday double team on the Brewers are fantastic ball players so you can still experience some of that.,guildball,cw6ct2d,1,t5_2znnp

6915722,0,t3_4agldb,Mist is probably your best bet because it gives you the only real solid scoring option available to a pure union team. A lot of players have a decent kick stat of  but just dont have the mobility tricks to reliably score. If you are interested in a beater team you could go fangtooth and be successful. Rage and Fangtooth pair very well together.,guildball,d107xe9,1,t5_2znnp
8148799,0,t3_4quwd6,They are using white text on all of the momentous results to contrast with the black background. Thus if the GB ball is white it is a momentous GB. If it is black then it is nonmomentous. You can see this in the double GB results.,guildball,d4w5b9d,2,t5_2znnp

9360640,0,t1_d91ydsp,I heard Blacksmiths or something. I dont know if there definitive proof of what the other team is. Id be fine with that though!,guildball,d92j1mw,1,t5_2znnp
9826926,0,t1_daogsi8,As of right now I am awaiting the Kickoff box for my first foray into Guild Ball.  Before this I was a fairly inactive Subbuteo player but I dont think any of that is on the right scale!,guildball,daogx3x,2,t5_2znnp
10397762,0,t3_5owjy4,We know very little but everything about the harvest tokens mechanic point to their playstyle being about planning and managing that resource above all else.,guildball,dcmni8e,2,t5_2znnp
10558319,0,t3_5r3ftc,Feet  dont pin.  Clip the foot bar to a tab and make a slot in your base for it.Look at Boars front foot.  Thats what I mean.The other pins are paperclips,guildball,dd4wl2d,2,t5_2znnp
10662915,0,t3_5sk62t,Farmers wont be out for a little over two months late April so unless you want to wait that long Id pick up something else to start with. Morts are a quite controlling playstyle and probably arent the best introduction to the game. Id go with Alchemists personally then by the time Farmers come out you might already be considering picking up another guild.Also have you considered Kick Off? Its a good value way to get into the game as it gives you all the accessories you need to start tokens templates a pitch as well as two guilds. The Kick Off miniatures arent as high quality as their metal counterparts but they arent bad once painted.,guildball,ddfsr16,1,t5_2znnp
10918807,0,t3_5vzoct,I would do the wash first if I were washing. To get a glowing effect you could make a glaze of green by mixing your green with some matte medium and water. To make glazes I like to mix enough water into medium to get the consistency I want and then add that mix to my colour to get the opacity I want.,guildball,de6750s,2,t5_2znnp
