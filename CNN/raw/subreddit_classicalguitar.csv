9635,0,t1_cef9jwv,This is a bit dismissive.  I mean a good healthy chunk of the avant garde is equal parts I could do that and Yeah but you didnt but just looking at the score for this clearly demonstrates depth far beyond a childs scribble.  None of this is random Babbitt was a serialist composer so the technical aspects of the composition are not immediately evident just by listening to it.  Read this analysis of the piece for a better idea of how its put together.  It follows an incredibly detailed set of rules and while they may be atonal and nontraditional they are still a valid part of composition.,classicalguitar,cefj686,1,t5_2sij1

2034498,0,t1_ckws9ag,Yeah I have a friend who moved to Spain to learn flamenco.  When he got back he could play flamenco.  No potential employer gave a shit they wanted to see his diplomacredentials.  So he went back to school.  Unless you are fortunate enough to make all of your living performing which almost no one is youre going to have to get a job somewhere.  Any musicrelated job that pays decently will require some sort of degree.  Even a BA or BMus looks better on a resume than lived in Spain.  And incidentally you can decrease that debt considerably by studying outside of the US.  University in Germany is free for citizens and only a few hundred Euro for internationals depending on where you go.  Then you have the best of both worlds.  If the academic aspect of it is what bothers you then youre going to have a tough time.  But my degree was hardly boring I played a major recital every year performed regularly ran ensembles.  Studying with my teacher through the university was cheaper than if I had studied with him privately.  My debt was only K Canadian and Ive never served coffee to anyone to pay it off.  You dont go to school for music if you expect to make a lot of money when you graduate.  You go because you want to learn as much as you can about something you have a passion for.  The more you know the more aspects of the business you are capable of working in.  Learning to play is just a small part of it.  You could spend all of your spare time and money taking lessons and practicing but then what?  Competitions?  Eventually you get too old to qualify and then youre at the mercy of the politics and some  year old Russian girl who can play circles around you.  Booking your own concerts and tours?  For the first few years that costs more than it earns and unless youre surprisingly good youre not going to make that back.  Might as well have paid for a degree.I get that you probably see guitar as a hobby and have no aspirations of making a living from it and thats fine it leaves more work out there for the rest of us.  But dont shit on peoples choices with your faulty logic.,classicalguitar,ckyfgxk,2,t5_2sij1

2558635,0,t3_2ozmyw,Guitar tech here! Acoustic instruments should be stored in approximately  humidity. Any more and itll cause swelling and if its hot enough i.e. the temperature of the inside of a car on a hot day it could even cause the glue to heat up and your guitar could basically fall apart!The vast majority of guitars are glued together with Titebond which is a GREAT glue to use and bonds stronger than wood. One of the upsides is the fact that you CAN heat it up and undo the glue so that the instrument doesnt become impossible to repair if needed in the future. The problem is as Ive said the inside of a hot car is about the same temperature that it takes to undo Titebond I. I always recommend a humidification system. The DAddario twoway gel pack stuff is great. Basically its idiot proof. If your guitar is dry itll release humidity. If it is too humid itll suck up the humidity to where it needs to be. Heres a linkOr I know that Guitar Center stocks this and you could get it same day but its something like  there.The ONLY downside is the gel packs dry up over time and you need to replace them. But again idiot proof. Use this and youll never have to think about it again.Lastly if youre only playing for an hour or so in the type of heat that the Yoga Studio is at youll be fine so long as you keep it humidified otherwise. This is one of those things though that Id say youll probably have to keep an eye on your tuning and Id show up early to allow your instrument to do any adjusting that its going to do in that different environment otherwise youll be constantly going out of tune.edit Also Im sorry but Im going to have to disagree with uWillyTheDisk. The increased heat and humidity absolutely CAN damage your guitar. And having the top swelled and the action higher will cause all sorts of other issues. Improper humidity isnt the MOST common problem I see on acoustics but it is probably number . Also keep in mind Guitar Tech is my main source of income. I work on all sorts of instruments all day long.,classicalguitar,cmsjuoy,3,t5_2sij1

Find a happy medium between Picture A and Picture B. Ideally you should be able to access all of the strings and all of the colors of the the guitar without having to move your arm too much.

5806189,0,t3_3uoqkd,Arranging is a wonderful exercise Im glad to see more of it happening.  It always seems like pulling teeth to get my students to try it so good on you for taking the initiative.  I cant really run through it right now so any of my comments are based on just looking at it.  Firstly you should keep it moving.  You set up the accompaniment in the beginning and then you stop to play the melody.  The accompaniment or at least elements of the accompaniment should continue behind the melody.  This brings me to my next point you have no bassline.  Part of the distinction of the original song is that big slow piano bassline and youve ignored it.  Most of the arrangements Ive seen use a more guitar friendly key that allows for better bass notes G works well but Ive also seen it in D.  The whole arrangement needs to be fleshed out more there is too much unused space.  Not that it needs to be constant virtuosic shred just that as it is its very empty and lacking in forward motion.  Also Im pretty sure the rhythm needs lots of work again I cant say for sure until Ive played it but there are some spots that just arent working.The process I use for solo guitar arranging is as follows melody bassline accompaniment.  Work out the melody add a really good bassline and then if you have any fingers left over fill in the space between.,classicalguitar,cxgt9p6,4,t5_2sij1

7941094,0,t3_4o04qn,Pretty composition and nicely played.  However if you think its appropriate in a classical guitar forum then I think you may have a fundamental misunderstanding of what classical guitar is.  Its not really sufficient for piece to be played fingerstyle as an instrumental to qualify as a classical guitar piece or in the classical guitar style.  The classical guitar repertoire is made up of pieces where the individual notes of the constituent intervals and chords are actually voices that form the melodies and they change in relation to themselves and the other notes in both the preceding and succeeding chords or intervals which is basically the definition of harmony.  I havent yet encountered a classical guitar piece that couldnt be broken up into its separate voices and each of them played individually.  Even contemporary composers for classical guitar like Gary Ryan deploy the techniques of phrasing and voices.  From listening to the piece youve posted I find it difficult to hear where you could either separate the voices in that manner or extract the melody.  As I said no dispute that its both pretty and well played but to label it as classical guitar or classical guitar style is probably going to be a little insulting to those who spend hours practising and understanding the principles of the style.,classicalguitar,d48nipg,0,t5_2sij1

But still when they transcribed that song from tablature to sheet music they could have used the G major key signature and keep the melody exactly as it is right now. I mean just by adding a sharp on the F note in the key signature would signal to the guitar player that he can expect to hear a song which is in the G major key.

9501499,0,t3_5aj85i,From my playing days it seems that the repertoire went like this Spanishish Romantic this includes Albeniz Granados Villa Lobos Rodrigo etc.Further down Baroque primarily Bach but others too.And then a very long way down th century music that isnt influenced by Spanish Romanticism some Brouwer York and folk like Milton Babbit. Renaissance music.As a performer I entirely rejected  Spanish Romanticism and embraced Baroque and eventually modernistpostmodernist music. As a listener I did not ever again need to listen to another CD of Spanish Greats. It seemed like every new guitarist coming out on CD had to do a crappy Spanish CD with all the standards and then maybe one or two pieces that werent popularly recorded.Ugh.So yeah I am  with the reviewer with the exception of the Cavatina bit  apparently they are too young to remember it being part of every recital in the s along with Classical Gas. The rest of the program in the review actually sounds interesting. I have absolutely no love for jazz but going to classical guitar recital and hearing it instead of Asturias and Bach is totally worth it.But of course you have to give the people what they want and what they want from the classical guitar is Spanishish Romanticism with some fun flamenco bits thrown in.,classicalguitar,d9k9gfg,2,t5_2sij1

9961131,0,t1_db5xg5j,No worries at all haha! I just wanted to know what I could specifically tell you  Carter was a pretty unbelievable composer and his music is really interesting. Obviously that wouldnt quite be the piece to play to swoon people haha. ,classicalguitar,db5ym1q,1,t5_2sij1
10026943,0,t1_daw4bm3,Although I dont use light strings they could be good depending on certain things namely if the players hands arent strong yet or if their guitar is a particularly long scale like mm or more or any other situation where the guitar is overall physically difficult to play.,classicalguitar,dbejdxk,1,t5_2sij1

10212395,0,t1_dc1lqub,Thank you! It does exist but I learned this piece by listening to Emre Sabuncuoglu perform it. So there are some minor differences in mine. He himself offers a tab but also has a performance with his hands clearly visible so there is really no need to purchase the tab other than to support which I am too broke to do I highly recommend you try and learn it by ear though its a good exercise. Seeing as I failed I myself have a lot to learn ,classicalguitar,dc1msbi,2,t5_2sij1

10875976,0,t1_de167ja,This guy is amazing no doubt. But Im trying to understand how he does it. Is he throwing in lots of slurs or is he actually plucking each note? Ive slowed down the video to half speed but im still not sure. ,classicalguitar,de1s2l9,1,t5_2sij1
10980573,0,t1_dece4iq,yeah thanks a lot that must be it. I did use the Aaron Shearer book the green one. I just got it out recently when I started lessons again. Ill have to look through it. Thanks!,classicalguitar,decm3dw,1,t5_2sij1

11060536,0,t3_5xw4d2,I like the thought of getting meditative. One of the most important things that I think is a challenge for most of us! is relaxation. So I would dedicate some time to closing your eyes and doing something in the absolute most relaxed fashion that you can. It could be the easiest pieces you know some basic arpeggios scales block chords or maybe just even playing one note over and over and adjusting tone or dynamics. I have yet to do a lot of this but it sounds like a good idea to me so I will hopefully report back if it helps in some way!,classicalguitar,delozlx,3,t5_2sij1

11167247,0,t3_5zckc4,Without a recording of your playing I cant say one way or another. One thing I can say for sure is that you didnt learn that piece at a blazing fast speed. Im not trying to take away from your achievement and I dont know what level youre at so that may be extremely fast considering your level. Im just not sure.Now you mention being a performer. Unless youre one of the most sought after guitarists in the world the purpose of performance is to  find students and  get your name out there for weddings and dinners. Others might disagree with me on this to some extent but this is at least my experience. Keep in mind I am not a professional musician though. I decided to go the comparatively easier route of academia Im a mathematician.Many posters here and I would be happy to give you more personal advice if you could post a recording of your playing.,classicalguitar,dexsnpt,2,t5_2sij1
11175196,0,t3_5zj33h,Grab your guitar at home and pretend that you are playing in the situation that you are nervous about. Play through the pieces like you would in that situation and pretend that you have an audience. I also think that some nervousness can even be good because it causes you to focus a little bit more. Good luck!,classicalguitar,deyp2cy,1,t5_2sij1
