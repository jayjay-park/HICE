Something that survives based on its capacity to hijack another creatures metabolism. ,FromThePrimordialSoup,df5ikzn,3,t5_3jjhx

11615702,0,t1_dgcknnb,This mutation idea inspired by the Kleincakes story going on at rHFY.Generational Memory.  This lets us pass down the intelligence of the parent psyper to child.  A new crystalline fragment grows inside each egg which is essentially a backup of the memories and knowledge made by the parent Psyper.  This leads to each new generation being exponentially more intelligent than the one before it and with our tongueegg ejection defense mechanism we have a good chance to ensure that no knowledge is truly lost.,FromThePrimordialSoup,dgcneuq,15,t5_3jjhx
