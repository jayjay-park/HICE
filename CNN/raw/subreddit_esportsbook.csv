8485990,0,t3_4vui19, X vs AGG X vs NokSuKaoIts the last day of group C in the qualifier for StarLadder iLeague Season  and fortunately there is still something to play for!ampnbspGroup C standingsNokSuKao is already out of the qualifier after two losses in two matches so they have nothing left to play for. Dignitas is in front of the group but both X and AGG have the chance to overtake the st place. AGG will secure at least a nd place in the group if they manage to beat X and X will subsequently have to beat NokSuKao in order to advange. If AGG however lose their match X will be winning group C and Dignitas will come in nd. ampnbspFormAdmittedly the remaining of group C doesnt seem so exciting as neither AGG nor NokSuKao should be any match for X. X managed to go  against Dignitas and Dignitas afterwards beat both AGG and NokSuKao . Dignitas played with ruggah as a standin in all of the three matches and it was clear that this affected their game play. Dignitas fell completely apart vs X but they somewhat straightened out their teamplay and adjusted to playing with ruggah vs AGG and NokSuKao. I will not give X a lot of credit for going  against Dignitas it was a case of Dignitas lacking team play  not X playing particularly well. ampnbspPredictionsPrediction  X vs AGG     Prediction  AGG will win a map vs X  Prediction  X vs NokSuKao     ampnbspCurrent market oddsX vs AGGBet         payout percentage  Betway         pp  eBettle        pp  EGB         pp  ampnbspAGG will win a mapBet    pp  eBettle   pp  ampnbsp X vs NokSuKaoBet         pp  Betway         pp  eBettle         pp   EGB          pp  ampnbspPredictions  betsBet  Small bet on AGG at odds  on Betway.The bettings sites generally have more faith in X than me and Betway is   off my prediction. Bet  Medium bet on AGG to pick up a map at odds  on eBettle.AGG has everything to win and nothing to lose so I reckon their will play their hearts out and pick up at least! one map.Bet  High bet on X at odds  on EGB.If this match is played X will be throwing everything theyve got into the match. NokSuKao on the other hand has nothing to play for. Also X is a far better team than NokSuKao.,esportsbook,d62amgv,1,t5_2ubnb
