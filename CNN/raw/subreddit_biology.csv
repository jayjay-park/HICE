Theres a steady flow of work from oil companies coastal states and the like who are required to survey around their seismic vessels for presence of marine mammals.

Another thought if you can get yourself trained to pilot those remotecontrol tiny drone hexacoptersquadcopters you will find some doors opening for marine mammal fieldwork. Those plus smart marine drones that swim around at sea on their own are becoming a major new force for marine research. Yet another thought the US Navy has a smallbutgood marine mammal research program that you could look into. If youre interested in animal training too... ever thought of checking out the Navy marine mammal training program in San Diego? The Navy maintains its own fleet of trained bottlenoses and sea lions. Its mostly for patrolling the animals are flown around the world to survey foreign ports but they have a whole breeding colony of each and actively collaborate with a lot of researchers as well.

Its not really that hard to figure out but my guess is that if the moth is largely unconcious when its in its pupae stage it will need some kind of unconcious way to defend itself from danger i.e. being eaten or getting crushed. So the motion of the pupae in response to the pressure is not actually the writhing that takes place when insects are experiencing physical discomfort or are in danger of being injured or eaten but rather a builtin subconcious defense mechanism that only gets activated in response to the stimuli of pressure acting on its body. This would explain why the wiggling stops immediately when the pressure is released. Its only designed to move itself out of direct immediate danger and nothing else. Once the wiggling has moved the pupae to a place where no physical force is acting on the body it returns to its normal stationary position and continues the mutation process. ,biology,ci6sa52,1,t5_2qhn7

1396222,0,t3_2a3qmt,gtThe typical explanation of how certain things evolved are often simple and do not explain anything in my opinion.  Im not going to try to give a comprehensive answer to your questions but rather explain why I think you will most likely not be able to find a satisfactory one so long as human brainslanguage are the example..  There is still a great deal of debate within evolutionary bio about specifics of all kinds.  Everyone agrees evolution is a thing.  But there are a lot of differing opinions on which evolutionary forces are the biggest factors is evolution gradual or herkyjerky at exactly what level of being is selection taking place how much is chance a factor etc.  Unfortunately something as complex as the human brain is exactly the sort of topic where all these points of difference converge.  So if you ask a lot of really smart people across a number of relevant respectable fields you will get a lot of very different answers.  There are entire fields that differ so much on this they spend a good deal of time arguing quite heatedly with one another..  As exemplified by the unsatisfactory answer you got from the bio student biology as a field has a big problem related to teleology and anthropomorphizing.  Any good biologist knows there is no goal in evolution.  But we cant find a good way to communicate it in everyday discussions.  Instead we constantly remind ourselves that the language we use is a short hand that is problematic.  In theory this works for biologists but the discussion invariably gets away from us when ideas are expressed to wider audiences.   .  The brainlanguageconsciousness are really loaded topics.  We set ourselves apart by our intelligence rightly or wrongly.  So any discussion on its evolution brings a whole lot of baggage with it and can easily deteriorate into dogmatic bickering.  So because of all these things I doubt anyone will give you an answer youll find compelling.

1398952,0,t3_29zgip,Going into your freshman year I would say it isnt critical to know exactly what your major is.  I am making an assumption here but if your are  or  years old you have plenty of time to figure it out so dont kill yourself over it.  That being said if you know that you are serious about going into a career in science start planning on grad school as EARLY AS POSSIBLE.  What I mean by this find a professor you like and ask them if you can volunteer to work in their lab and get real experience working in that lab.  Eventually you will be able to do some undergrad research through independent study or an REU program.  Keep your grades up and make connections ask questions in lectures and make sure your professors know you you will need them for letters of recommendation down the road.  If you like biology take the intro classes and see how you do a general BS in bio is a good place to start because it is very broad and you will be able to take upper level classes that are more specific and then graduate school will be even more tailored to your interests you will figure out what those are when you take general science coursework.  There are a TON of career options that are not desk jobs in the sciences but there are also many that are so keep that in mind.  If you are interested in human biology look into the environmental sciences as well as fields like toxicology which all have a very important human component to them. No matter what make sure the field you are interested in is something that you enjoy doing science can be very rewarding but also very tedious and can often feel like a grind.  Undergraduate work can be difficult especially when undertaking research projects and lab work.  ,biology,cirn0u8,1,t5_2qhn7

Even if you dont know even if nobody knows it doesnt change what is and what isnt.We know that DNA isnt perfect and mistakes are made. Transcription errors happen all the time where strands of DNA are copied incorrectly and base pairs are inserted where they shouldnt be. Sometimes viral DNA can incorporate itself into its hosts genetic material. These things happen all the time and we know they happen because we can see them happen. Also evolution doesnt require that information be added to the genome it just needs to change over time. In  four hundred hundred years if Redheads have become extinct or if people with webbed toes are more common than people without the amount of information in each individuals genome hasnt changed by very much. What has changed is the contents of that genome.,biology,cjow7q6,20,t5_2qhn7

From what I understand the system is completely different from the European system. How do you go about finding and getting a PhD position? How many years does a PhD typically last there?gtAlso could you please clear up what the graduate postgrad and undergrad levels are? I have a Bachelors Degree and am currently in my nd and last year of Masters and am always lost when reading requirements as Im just not sure what the terms correspond to.gtThanks in advance for helping me out! So for starters undergrad is bachelors. Grad is Masters or PhD. Postdoc is like the job or training you do after you get your PhD. A PhD on the US typically takes  to  years. It depends obviously on what you do your PhD on. To get started you will want to literally just Google schools or the areas you would want to move to. When you find a program you are interested in contact the professor whose area of interest corresponds to what you are most interested in. Ask them for more information and if you can talk about possible thesis options. You also want to look at the school requirements. Many will require a GRE score. Make sure you dedicate yourself to a program. No school likes to see you halfassing your cover letter and applying to a hundred schools. gtedit sorry about formatting.

3158396,0,t1_copcd6i,gtSo would I be understanding it correctly by saying that there really isnt a decision being made in a weighing the good and the bad sense but more of a set of thresholds that cause chemical cascades that would allow the limb to die?Based on my knowledge and what crappysurfer has stated yep. I dont have an understanding of the subprocesses occurring within the tree to say exactly how the limb would start to die but in general if a limb doesnt receive enough nutrients it begins to die. By not supplying any of the nutrients the limb needs itself it would rely on pulling in nutrients from the trunk of the tree. These resources are finite so if the tree cant supply enough the limb will have to die in part or in whole. What Id like to know more about is if there are mechanisms that prevent any nutrients from being sent to the limb when a limb stops producing killing the limb or if the limb is must not able to import enough resources to stay alive.,biology,copd667,2,t5_2qhn7

3698514,0,t3_32r1hc,I cant think of any goto resource but Ive always like Neil Degrasse Tysons and Bill Nyes arguments supporting evolution and debunking creationist ideas. Heres a nice Scientific American article that debunks  creationist ideas for starters though. Honestly you should really just ignore these creationists. No matter how much evidence you throw at them no matter how scientific evidence you have supporting you and no matter how much evidence you have that their arguments are wrong theyll never back down and theyll never change their minds. This also extends to antivaxxers. Heres a study that found that  different messages to antivaxxers failed to convince any of them to change their views.Theres a theory in psychology called cognitive dissonance theory which can help explain why this is the case. Basically it states that when a person is exposed to information that is contrary to their beliefs they experience cognitive dissonance that is to say there is internal conflict over the two conflicting beliefs e.g. I shouldnt be eating this donut because it is high in fat which I know is bad for me. People deal with the dissonance in four ways change their behaviorcognition I wont eat the donut justify the new behaviorinformation by changing the conflicting behaviorcognition Im allowed to cheat every once in a while justify the new behaviorinformation by adding new behaviorscognition Ill go to the gym and work it off or ignoredeny the new information that conflicts with the existing behaviorcognition This donut is not high in fat. Antivaxxers and creationists will tend to use the fourth method of dealing with dissonance rather than the other three. This is because of the belief disinformation paradigm which states that if the dissonance is not reduced by changing ones beliefs then the dissonance can restore consonance through misperception rejection or refutation of the new information or by seeking those who have the same beliefs or by trying to persuade others that their beliefs are right. Basically since creationists are normally very religious Christians or live very religious lives and so if they accept evolution as true then dissonance occurs since theyve been taught that creationism is true and the Bible is the book that never lies a bit of an exageration but not by a longshot. Because accepting evolution does not completely resolve the dissonance as it requires them to question the entirety of the Bible by extension they turn to the belief disinformation paradigm and seek instead to refute evolution in order to restore consonance in their lives.,biology,cqdusuy,3,t5_2qhn7

The ones you linked are made for benchworkthe extension under the lens is based on the focal length and is clear to let light in. You set the jewel or photo or whatever down set the lens over it and then look through the lens. They are especially popular for closeup examination of flat art and text since they keep a constant distance from the subject without wearing out the armyou can literally look until you cry if you want without getting sore arms. I dont think they would work for field work very well though.In addition to the loupes linked to in the other comments something Ive usedseen is to grab a pair of these guys  and flip them backwards. Looking through the rubber eyecups in the normal way magnifies objects at a distance but if you flip them and peer through the objective lens a subject close to the eyepiece is magnified not unlike a microscope though far less powerful obviously. Various models will have varying levels of magnification and varying amounts of distortion but its always gotten me through in a pinch not to mention you get a free pair of binoculars thrown in D.

Bearded vultures for example break open large mammal bones by dropping them from great height onto hard rocks in order to break them into smaller pieces. They dont know how to do this at first. They must practice and watch other vultures engaging in this activity in order to learn where the good rocks are and how to carry and drop your bone just right so that it hits where you want it to hit. Perhaps the fact that the younger birds will observe and mimic the older birds is instinctive but the actual technique is certainly not.Most large birds spend a good deal of time learning how to hunt from their parents. Snakes generally do not. I believe this is a good indication of what behaviors are instinctive and what are learned. How much time post birth does it take for the juvenile to be fully independent. In animals such as elephants beavers and humans this is very long since there is so much to learn. insects and fish are generally left on their own from birth and all the other animals run the range between those extremes.,biology,ct12osr,2,t5_2qhn7

Make sure you read up a bit on their research so you know what they specialize in!Careerwise the sky is the limit with your interests. Biochemistry and Environmental Biology have been disparate fields for a while but I know of a handful of researchers who combine the fields and that is what defines Chemical Ecology today. Biochem career pathways can mainly constitute  major areas Academia Industry or Government. Within biochemistry its highly recommended to pursue higher education after undergrad but it is not necessary depending on who you know at which companies it all depends what you are looking for. Academia presents yourself to be a PI or researcher associated with the university as an independent researcher. Industry wise you can be doing a wide variety of jobs from testing enzymatic rates crystallizing and determining protein structures... the sky is the limit and depending on the company you will likely be hired to work on a team to develop some sort of product. The government side is also variable as well but there is a greater emphasis for understanding of the process you are looking at as well as evaluating safety of products developed by other biotech companies.I cant say I was too specific but if you want to work in a lab now just ask about.

The processes that generate microevolution within a species are exactly the same as the processes that generate macroevolution into new species.

Not only can these plants not not share a niche with other species theoretically no species can  they prevent any other plants from growing across huge swaths of land regardless of their niche.Florida separates their invasive plants into Category I and II invasives. By definition Category I invasives have already altered native plant communities and caused welldocumented ecological damage.

Retrotransposons act like retrovirus in a way that the transposition is done with an RNA intermediate that is transcribed from the retrotransposon DNA by RNA polymerase II or III and then the RNA intermediate is reverse transcribed back to DNA by reverse transcriptase followed by the integration to its target by an integrase.On the other hand transposition of a transposon does not required an RNA intermediate because an enzyme called transposase can recognise the inverse repeat sequences on the  and  end of the transposon and cuts out the DNA and then integrate it to its target sequence.They as well as other DNA that do not code for protein are called junk DNA.

Assuming eye color is a singlelocus gene I dont think it is but lets just pretend for ease of explanation there are far too many different colors of eye to simply be the result of a dominant brown and a recessive blue allele.

7850246,0,t3_4mubet,No you cant. Organisms are carbon neutral. The reason for this is simple all biomass is derived from carbon fixing processes. That means that some organism like a plant or bacteria takes carbon from the atmosphere often in the form of CO and turns it into sugar. Those sugars are then burned by the organism producing energy and releasing CO. The key point is however that the CO was in the atmosphere BEFORE the organism fixed it and was simply released again later. For that reason organisms have no net effect on CO in the ocean. As a sub point the more organisms there are in the ocean the less CO is available though it will most likely be negligible. Thats because when carbon is fixed within an organism it cannot affect the environmnent.TLDR No. Organisms move carbon around they dont create it. ,biology,d3yfrcy,1,t5_2qhn7
7853507,0,t1_d3ysfep,Yeah but animals dont fix sugars using atmospheric carbon we just oxidize it to form CO so in a transient system which OP is referring to it is definitely possible for the CO concentration to increase.  Youre right that if an ecosystem were kept at equilibrium the amount of CO would remain constant in the environment since the amount of carbon oxidized would equal the amount of carbon reduced through photosynthesis.  But say if the population of photosynthetic organisms were to grow at a slower pace than the population of organisms that cannot fix their own carbon carbon would be oxidized at a quicker pace than it could be reduced and CO would accumulate in the atmosphere.Correct me if Im wrong here but I think that CO certainly can accumulate in the environment.,biology,d3ysz6b,1,t5_2qhn7

Since youre in your th year you already have a grasp of chemistry you may want to consider pharmacology and pathology courses.

7990544,0,t1_d4e64ct,Workload The workload is a typical science workload  fairly high. Youre always in competition with the other groups internationally in your niche and in competition with other local scientists for grant money. But most people I know have found a reasonable worklife balance. To be a young lab head at the top of the game many of the international Aleague players work ridiculously hard plus they had a stellar PhD paper in Nature or the like followed by a great postdoc in a bigshot lab with lots of funding and a high publication rate. So the workload depends on your ambition.Specifics Im a team leader for a genomicsepigenetics group. I used to be in the lab but swapped to a bioinformatics role about  years ago.  Age at PhD .  years at uni. I went the slow way by doing a Masters degree as originally I never intended to do a PhD. Its only when I realised I needed one to get the research roles I wanted.  Job  Bachelors At uni I had a student job filling shelves in the evening. After the BSc I enrolled in a MSc. After the MSc I couldnt find a job for  months.  job applications. In the end a PhD scholarship offer came in a couple of days before a job interview as a science sales rep. Some things about your career have elements of luck and fate. This was one of them.  GPA No no really I had to fight to get a PhD scholarship. I always took too much coursework on as I was too curious I always maxed out the course load the university would allow. Plus I had bad study habits I worked and I liked to party. In my undergrad years I was very naive about the job market and about postgrad study.  Would I recommend the PhD route? There are far easier career paths than science. A PhD can be a long dark road. And after as a postdoc expect high stress and financial uncertainty and a requirement to move citiescountries to find work every  years.

8078239,0,t3_4puxhm,A couple thoughts. Maybe someone can chime in with a better answer. First atoms and molecules are always moving around so there is always water moving both in and out of the cell at the same time. Rules like diffusion and osmosis relate to net movement. When we say that water is moving into the cell down an osmotic gradient we really mean that more water is moving into the cell than out of the cell but water is still moving in both directions.To the part of your questions about the NaK pump I think it may be important to keep in mind that most of the dissolved solutes in cells are proteins which make up  of the cytosol not ions so the movement of small numbers of ions should not greatly affect the osmotic gradient. I might be wrong on this one its just a hunch.,biology,d4o2icm,2,t5_2qhn7

I used to have to carry a spider web stick with me in the woods to sweep webs out of the way when I walked because the feeling of a single strand of web on me would give me a mild case of panic.  As a child I once woke up and noticed a spider hanging from a thread in my bedrooms doorway and screamed for my parents to come dispose of it because I was too terrified to move.  I used to go into wild flailings whenever a spider fell onto me from some branches or whatever.Like you I also thought there were intrinsically interesting and I used to watch and feed orb weavers on our acreage in the woods.

I mean its never a bad thing to read and I am definitely not trying to say youre not capable of selfstudy definitely sure you are! but if you know absolutely no science whatsoever you might struggle with some concepts such as genetics or the Krebs cycle  if youre in a class you can quiz the teacher when you hit those bumps. Over here there are always inexpensive evening courses so you can upgrade while keeping a job. Is that maybe an option? Otherwise if you want an introduction to biology I would recommend borrowing a high school textbook from your local library. Maybe Biology by Neil Campbell? Honestly to start out if really recommend taking a course though. Whatever you choose to do best of luck and I hope you get to live your dream someday soon! ,biology,d7u3bzm,1,t5_2qhn7

9278521,0,t3_57hq22,your brain would break from that as in you would not likely be able to see images. the eyes in particular the retina and optic nerve are really a part of the brain without appropriate staining the optic nerve is barely discernable from brain tissue surrounding it. The real problem would be that your brain takes a very long time learning how to see through your particular set of eyes the problem would be there even with an eye transplant from the same species. As for seeing outside the normal spectrum there is nothing outside of the retina that dictates red green and blue light only plz. If you did have a healthy retina that could see outside the normal visible spectrum your brain would learn how to see images from the new retina in the brain its much more like data than anything to do with actual color. in this sense your brain would not break from that. This is assuming you have a developing infant brain. adult brains are not very good at learning to see images from an untrained retina the plasticity of the young brain seems to be necessary for this.ive heard it said and so far know it to be true that while there are sports and music prodigies these activities are made easier by the tiny and quick movements that small children can make easily. there are no prodigies in the visual arts as far as observation goes the brain simply spends a much larger portion of your life learning how to use your eyes than it does your other sense organs,biology,d8s4b43,1,t5_2qhn7

Not that it cant be true but this may still be a natural history limitation if you consider the sheer number of sequence possibilities for a polymerase it may be that there is an amino acid sequence where a DNA primer may be optimal but that it was never explored through evolutionary mechanisms. ,biology,d8up9it,1,t5_2qhn7

9406034,0,t3_59gbvw,I had a similar question when I was taking the second semester of biochem. There is one fatty acid that the human body cannot synthesize linoleic acid which is only produced by plants and necessary for the production of leukotrienes and prostaglandins. These two biomolecules are essential for mediating pain inflammation allergic reaction etc. It would be unwise to inhibit fat absorption due to this! On the other hand most fatty acids found in our body are in the form of palmitic acid. This fatty acid can be converted to longerunsaturated chains or can be metabolized via betaoxidation. Theoretically removing all fatty acids aside from linoleic acid would cause the body to source all of its energy needs from monosaccharides which would not cause any issues.,biology,d98a4aq,28,t5_2qhn7

Youre thinking of fat as more of a liquidgel something that can be pushed around which is not at all the case.

11476136,0,t1_dfwk9vx,Your last comment made me smile... in  I think we are beyond Dawkins genecentric reductionist view of evolution!  Epigenetics for example is so last decade!  And the role of microbes in evolution of megaflora and fauna is just getting off the ground but I digress.Thank you for the thorough answer with all those links.  It seems that the answer to why not group selection is inclusive fitness or kin selection which Hamilton and his green beards elucidated so eloquently.  To me it appears that Hoelldobler and Wilson are saying that kin selection alone cannot account for the rise of cooperative behavior.  Altruism in Wilsons view depends on intergroup conflict and patchy resources in addition to a genetic component leading to traitgroup selection.  Critics say the math does not support his claim that inclusive fitness is a much better model of altruistic behavior.In  I took a summer field class with a lab component on the Evolution of Human and Animal Behavior and by the end of the class if someone not me!maybe brought up group selection the professor would appear visibly irritated as if to signal Dont you get it yet there is no group selection!  I was surprised at how much of a reaction that concept received and to be honest his emotional response impressed me enough to make me even more interested in understanding why evolutionary biologists have to either stake a claim on group selection or steer clear of it altogether.A quick read on the Wikipedia page for Group Selection redirected from traitgroup selection model shows me that there are still avenues to be explored in this model such as multilevel selection population viscosity geneculture evolution in humans and evolutionary stable strategies.  Cultural evolution in humans seems especially bolstered by the concept of group selection.Group selection can be ignored but it will not go away!  Maybe because there will always be people who dont quite understand why it is wrong or maybe because there is still some meat on that bone. ,biology,dfwtdjj,1,t5_2qhn7

11515482,0,t1_dg18s0o,Thanks for the last link I wasnt aware that there is a structural probabilistic vs. connectionists discussion. Im a big fan of dynamical system approaches such as the mentioned DFT so Im not sure which side Im on.I associated the approach of Markram in the Blue Brain project with a bottom up approach. I think this should be combined with top down theories. Deep learning is definitely interesting. The sparse coding paper is similar in the sense that the resulting learned features are edge detectors which also happens in lower levels of deep learning models. One can also try to understand which symbolic semantic a network learns e.g. here so maybe there is not this dichotomy of symbolicconnectionist.,biology,dg1a535,1,t5_2qhn7

11544944,0,t1_dg4262r,What I can tell you from my experience is that depending on the university and the graduate program there may be an opportunity to be a teaching assistant and that may wave your tuition and give you a salary to work off of. Some of the MSc programs here in California set it up so internships are part of your coursework and that in turn sets you up for a career afterwards. Depending on the medical route you want to pursue you may just need to take some certifications and you should look at that as an investment rather than acquiring more dept. ,biology,dg4mdnw,2,t5_2qhn7

11574843,0,t1_dg7uftr,Nah its for sure doable just more than  of people think sitting in a room while someone talks and having a piece of paper after four years will get you a job. Ive seen far too many people end up as baristas or telemarketers with a biology degree from a rather prestigious school. If you dont rally your degree for all its worth and get experience in the area you want then a bachelors of biology is about as useful as a bachelors of business. ,biology,dg80j78,1,t5_2qhn7

11618348,0,t1_dgccoe1,The three fields you listed are the most insanely competitive ones of biology.The jobs widely available to those with a B.S. in biology are labs involving benchwork NOT field work.  If field work is your goal then I do NOT recommend pursing this because its unlikely you will find a job without any experience and without a willingness to relocate or spend time away from your family.  Your age isnt really a factor but the extreme difficulty in finding a job in marine biology is.If you want to work with wildlife maybe you should do some research and find out if theres a job out there associated with say the Parks and Rec department where you can work outdoors.  I dont think biology is what you think it is.  Consider a degree in environmental engineering or outdoor recreation instead.,biology,dgcy7z8,5,t5_2qhn7

If you work for someone its always supply vs demand. There are a glut of people that didnt quite make it into med school that are perfectly qualified to be an entry level tech.

11715846,0,t1_dgny7i2,As the other person who replied pointed out it depends a lot on the journal. Larger journals with more resources are able to be more rigorous and are much much less susceptible to fraud than smaller more specialised journals. Theres always going to be a limit to how thorough you can be and there will always be people trying to cheat the system.So I cant really imagine how a system could be significantly better though the peerreview process can always evolve bitbybit from lessons like these. The most important thing is to be open to criticism and recognise the shortcomings to allow that evolution. I dont think we should hold our breath for a silver bullet. But this is why its safer to rely more on scientific consensus on a given topic rather than on any single study.,biology,dgo0qom,3,t5_2qhn7
