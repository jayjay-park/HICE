4545659,0,t3_3db8s5,The initial lineup announcement in  had  artists on the billing and the second phase added another  artists not including the preparty Electron Silent Disco or Late Night at Spirit Lake sets.In other words this is likely less than half of the total number of artists that will be performing. Id expect phase  to drop in late August or early September but I dont expect there to be any additional headliners.That said Id be pumped of Kung Fu returned to Suwannee. ,hulaween,ct3ludr,3,t5_32fsp
4633523,0,t1_ctejz35,Since the early s though I dont think they acheived much popularity until about  or so at least I never heard of them being around before then. Theyve gained a lot of popularity on the festival circuit. They seem to get bigger each year. Theyre great collaborators I often see them in guest spots. Members of the band backed several of the bonnaroo superjams including the hip hop superjam in  if I remember correctlyThe drummer is a member of Break Science and several of the guys from lettuce are in the break science live band. Also a few of the guys from lettuce are in Pretty Lights live band.They bring the funk so hard! Theyre my favorite funk band and Im really excited to see them on the lineup this year,hulaween,ctemhv5,3,t5_32fsp
4689632,0,t1_ctlmo4x,Im not even kidding my girlfriend was having the worst time. Everything surrounding our favorite festival was falling apart. From our huge crew to the insane amounts of people and a few other things. We were walking around the forest after trying to see Gramatik but it was too crowded. So we wandered the Forest and ran into this amazing music that just made us start dancing. Goldfish is not to be missed for us anyways. ,hulaween,ctlo6gd,4,t5_32fsp

5382630,0,t3_3oqxdx,Unless youre buying a highend tent its totally worth an extra  to get a can of spray waterproofing even for new tents. Cover the storm fly as well as the underlayer as in my experience Florida rain is not bound by the law of gravity and can often travel sideways and upward. Let spray dry thoroughly and hit the bottom again if you have leftover in the can. I find silicon based works fine for normal nylonbased tent fabrics. ProtipDo this OUTSIDE with good ventilation.Take some time and set up your new tent BEFORE you travel.  Doing it in good lighting with no rain wind etc lets you learn the idiosyncrasies  every tent has them. Plus its fun like when you were a kid building a fort in your living room or backyard.EDIT  more directly to OPs question I think since theres potential for cold nights Id look for a tent whose screen vents all have a zipclosed cover. I have a nice small summer tent whose entire top is noseeummesh.  Might be great for keeping the bugs out but aint gonna hold in the heat at all. Im packing my heavier family tent solely because all the windowsdoorsvents zip closed.,hulaween,cvzowuq,2,t5_32fsp

5556307,0,t3_3r8euu,Ive been to several Wanees and while it was really crowded this year it did t bother me at all. I got in around noon on Friday it took about an hour to buy a ticket from the box office and make it all the way to our site. We had no problem finding one just down the road from the river. It might have far away from the action for some people but it was just right for us. With a little planning ahead we didnt have to walk from our campsite to the mainstays once. Just had to sick out our thumb and wait about two min for a heady brah on a golf cart to swoop us up.No that I think about it some of the amputheTer sets were pretty fucking packed. At the mainstage I always had plenty of room.I heard someone who looked somewhat official say they sold  presale box office sales. I totally understand how some people like a bit of a smaller crowd at this venue but for me it was perfect especially after attending a few of the huge mega fests cochella bonnarroo voodoo fest. Glad you had fun despite feeling a little cramped.Please tell me you caught the Sci ghoultrain  set. Timed my doses just right. Was peaking right when GZA came out. Still trying to wrap my mind around what went down. The. That Exodus...holy shit,hulaween,cwlt7gf,7,t5_32fsp

8816144,0,t3_50qgjc,If you bring a bike bring a beach cruiser it works well on the dirt roads the general store also rents bikes. You could bring a float the current can get pretty swift at times though most people just wade in the water. Toilet paper they run out very fast especially in the portpotties. Portable battery charger for your phone or camera if you need it I suggest this. Someone already mentioned a flashlight you could also use your phone if you dont have service just turn it on airplane mode. Something to sleep in wether its a tent or hammock or even an RV. You can camp by your car if you buy the pass I highly suggest that so you dont have to track your items into the venue. Get there early for a good spot the lake is a big party place but they also highly target that area especially during main stage events. Bring a canopy just incase you dont get a spot under the trees. Chairs something to sleep on warm and cold clothes. Dont forget costumes I plan on wearing one every day. MOST IMPORTANTLY BRING GOOD VIBES AND GET READY FOR AN AWESOME WEEKEND!,hulaween,d77kwyg,3,t5_32fsp
