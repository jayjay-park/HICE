4470185,0,t3_38zg0e,Its also not very pleasant when they show the exact same SoftBall game on both ESPN and ESPN  and scroll across the bottom on both channels NHRA Drag Racing from Atlanta Coming Up Next. For   hours.,NHRA,csu537f,1,t5_2u0ed

6570754,0,t1_czyr46k,Heres the thing.NHRA screwed up the international rights to the NHRA big time.  A week ago they issued a press release advising from some time in march around the rd race there would be a streaming service.  They also announced an organisaton Green Light who they sold the interational distribution rights to.  At the time of the press release there was deals done with the UK and Greece.No one else outside of the US can watch the NHRA at this point in time.  We cant watch it live which is not too much fo an issue for me personally.  We cant watch packaged highlights.The only way to watch it is if someone posts it via social mediayoutube.As I said elsewhere amp I posted about  weeks ago the NHRA have screwed the pooch on this.,NHRA,czyyy2y,4,t5_2u0ed
