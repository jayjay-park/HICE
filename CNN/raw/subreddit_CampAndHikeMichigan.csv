605820,0,t1_cg945r1,I have been to wilderness state park LP when I was much younger. I remember it being great. We are doing a large car camping family trip in Gaylord MI Otsego lake and then backpacking the Manistee River trailNCT loop. Also likely doing the Jordan river pathway and a loop in the porky mtns if we can get another long weekend. Labor day will prly work for one of those. Id like to avoid crowds but that is usually the best option with getting work off. I thought the waterloo pinckney trail looked like a mountain bike trail through towns? Am I totally wrong on that? I liked the location of it bc I wouldnt have to drive too far to start it. I prefer the more wilderness type paths though. Just wondering what you have heard and plan on doing on that trail? That is a point to point trail not a loop right? Backcountry campsites? Fires allowed?That Thunder bay trip looks fantastic. Hopefully the conditions will be clear and calm for you then. At least it should be warm out by then. Can you snorkel or dive the shipwrecks out there? We also have a furchild and she is pretty independent. We have left her behind with extra food and water for  days and she is good. She looks at us when we come home like youre home already?!. She has a babysitter planned for our longer trips though. We have decided to put off human children for a while bc we want to do more traveling first.  ,CampAndHikeMichigan,cg94v9m,1,t5_3031h

1030974,0,t3_24n07n,Just as a heads up the NCT portion of the loop has very few options for filtering water. The MRT side of the loop has a lot of options for filtering. I believe the NCT portion has a  mile stretch without any water. I went up a few weekends ago for an easy trip. We parked at Seaton Creek campground hiked down towards Red Bridge and came back the way we came. All on the MRT side lots of water views and nice campsites.  Whatever you choose to do Im sure you will have fun. ,CampAndHikeMichigan,chlh6lf,1,t5_3031h

7242088,0,t3_4em7u4,That definitely sounds right. Id suggest checking out the North Country Trail  it goes through the Ottawa NF and is beautiful. If youre up for a short hike to a really nice campsite pm me and I can point you to a beautiful cliff side campsite with fire ring. ,CampAndHikeMichigan,d21dfke,3,t5_3031h
11147586,0,t1_der7e7c,I have a friend who has a place in Alpena so this place is in a good location. Isle Royale is definitely on the bucket list but I think I want to do something a little less extreme for this trip hahaSo in regards to Byron Lake you just parked somewhere off of Aspen Alley road then picked up a trail from there? It looks like that is part of the Hoist Lake Area does that sound right?Hiking the trail at Pictured Rocks sounds absolutely amazing. I definitely would have to do another trail or do just part of it to get my feet wet again. Are there any specific parts of the trail youd recommend? Also where did you stay on that trail?,CampAndHikeMichigan,devkf6d,2,t5_3031h
