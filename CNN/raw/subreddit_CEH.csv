3710071,0,t1_cqaemri,I just read a ceh book and I can honestly say I hate the idea of taking the test.   for an exam that process nothing and gives you about as much practical hands on as the cissp and to be honest worth very little.  Ive seen only a handful of jobs ask for it... But in reality I need to do everything I can to be marketable so I might end up taking it anyway,CEH,cqf69kw,1,t5_2s32x
