8824409,0,t3_505tco,. Could we have some more information on how the helicopters will work? For example Helicopters fly quite fast so the map must be pretty large in order to accommodate them? Could we see how large the maps will be?. Will there be any destructible environment buildings?,rs2vietnam,d78klrm,1,t5_3ee0j
9368431,0,t1_d92w4kf,It looks gorgeous but even shit on silver platter shines.Yeah I knew right away from playing the beta that it was going to be ridiculously casual oriented like Cod is.The setting feels more like a steampunk WWII rather than a grim WWI. Automatic weapons everywhere and frantic running about instead of semiorganized push to objectives.,rs2vietnam,d93ikih,10,t5_3ee0j

10778451,0,t1_ddrpmsv,I feel you man. Have signed up for the alpha beta for a long time without getting in. Sale for this game? Nah.They will not demand  dollars for this game like other half finnished triple A games does nowdays. ,rs2vietnam,ddrpwdu,8,t5_3ee0j
10790172,0,t1_ddpy8uq,Fun fact The most common nonRussianAmericanFrenchChinese weapon of the Vietnam War was the K. The Russians got their hands on millions of the things and gave them away to practically every insurgent movement they could find in the s and s.Id love to see MGs Ks and MPs since all three were common enough to warrant their appearance in various pamphletsmanuals depicting common VC weapons.,rs2vietnam,ddsxhpj,7,t5_3ee0j

11231714,0,t1_df515x7,Yea on Song Be  there are only a few good landing spots that get you close to the action the most useful ones being in the clearings to the north of Bravo and Delta atleast that I am aware of. People with experience on the RPG know to just camp there to near completely deny those LZs.I think the key to successful transport landings when the enemy camps the important LZs is to communicate and work with your ground troops. If a squad or three or so men makes it their mission to keep the field behind delta clear then helicopters can land there all game.Coordination with the loach also is effective if the loach does a scout flyby over the LZ they can spot out any camping MGs or RPGs before the huey flies into a potential death trap. Recon also should be up about every two minutes which will show you atleast some of the RPGs positions on the mapAnother good tip for huey pilots if the common LZs are camped is to land often has to be a hard landing due to terrain at the enemys last point and cut them off. If the enemy is forward enough to cover the normal places you want to land you probably wont face as much resistance at the enemys furthest point.At the end of the day though a Hueys success really does depend on the compentency of enemy RPGs or MGs on an AA mission. Ive had a round where I landed more than  people safely and only lost  to enemy fire poor landing and then rounds where I was only able to pull off a handful of useful landings and got blown up every time I tried to go to a good landing spot,rs2vietnam,df53lss,2,t5_3ee0j
11241136,0,t1_df65tm4,GPUCPU? Not sure buddy I disabled framerate smoothing set everthing to ultra set resolution to k and almost all my performance issues went away. Still get drops on Hue but they are minor compared with before. Make sure not to have SSAO enabled otherwise I am not sure what will help I dont even have it on an SSD and it doesnt stutter much. I did increase the texture pool size in the engine.ini to  from  as that helps in previous UE games with stuttering.The fact it runs the same as on low should give you some clue though that the game is badly optimized still try experimenting with settings maybe you need framerate smoothing enabled as its different depending on system. ,rs2vietnam,df65zzp,1,t5_3ee0j

11407017,0,t3_62syqs,Voices are indeed very bad. British in Heroes of the West were made better than this. Better than in a commercial product!!! where is the expected quality lol?Vietnamese sound awful all voices are quiet none of the other players are being heard as frequently as in RORS.Nobody is screaming when they are being burnt with a flamethrower napalm or WP. RS did much better. In RS all voices are lack of power lack of swearings and racial slurs no screaming no yelling no charge button whatsoever. I hope all theese voiceovers are an april fools joke. Im testing this game since early alpha and sadly I dont see that the game is going to do a blast now.,rs2vietnam,dfoyzhm,19,t5_3ee0j
11413550,0,t3_62tcun,gtSay if I wanted a shotgun that does everythinganything thats not the duckbill or the sawnoff.wrt Ammo  fires  pellets but you only need to hit them with  no. fires  giving much better coverage but they wont go through anything tougher than a rice paper wall and you need to hit them with more.  So basically it depends on how much youre shooting through walls as to whether you use ,rs2vietnam,dfppquq,4,t5_3ee0j
11416363,0,t1_dfpylfc,Dude its a beta the point is to get constructive criticism you dont have to protect the game.,rs2vietnam,dfq17j5,2,t5_3ee0j
11441733,0,t1_dfrifg3,Same. Im here rubbing my hands and praying that our senpais notice this post. It really expresses what I feel.A realistic experience is not just that the recoils high and bullets are very deadly its also when you say yuck and when you see your enemy and think I did that? Fuck me... Thats what makes the RO franchise the most accurate nonsim war game. Its not just the realism. Its the realness. And I should stress the war in war game. Its not merely about combat its about that odd clusterfuck of fear sweat guts random acts of bravery and helplessness.,rs2vietnam,dfswrkc,2,t5_3ee0j

11452198,0,t1_dfu2ds9,You seem like a lovely fella dont know what did I do to earn personal attacks like that. Or the other people. Anyway yes I do believe that if this information spreads further more and more people would demand taking this ridiculous development stance back. And due to the nature of the internet oh boy Im sure this thing will find the right ears. In fact I myself have found out about it by word of mouth and yes Im pissed about this because I dont believe personal belief should influence a game like that especially a game that tries to recreate semirealistic warfare authentically with the proper atmosphere. I want my soldiers to talk like soldiers and not Christianized saints. And Im saying it as someone who used to be a devout Catholic and still knows plenty of sensible Catholic people who would also be pissed about stupidity like this. Even priests.,rs2vietnam,dfu3j5t,9,t5_3ee0j
