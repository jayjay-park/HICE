The majority of the information is correct and it is formatted in a way that is very easy to use for newer developers. However when it is wrong it can be harmful and Im speaking from experience here. When there are other resources that are easier to understand andor with more up to date information theres no reason for wschools to be dominating the others in terms of popularity. By all means use what you prefer but whilst wschools has problems and not just the problems with incorrect information then there will be people calling them out on it and trying to spread better resources.,css,ceu4gm6,1,t5_2qifv

1543226,0,t1_cj9pgxb,Because its an image. CSS is built and intended for styling webpage content. Its for making the presentation layer. Its not designed to create beautiful pictures or logos. It can do but its accomplished by adding a pile of unsemantic markup and twisted hacky CSS. On the other hand an svg is specifically designed for this kind of purpose. It can use CSS tools but also svg specific things like painting shapes and lines. And it can be automatically generated by image making software. You my be able to cut through a plank with a drill press. Itll take a lot of actions and will make a somewhat ugly cut but it can be done.

I prefer the scss syntax personally. scss  compass has changed the way my entire office writes our css files. granted everyone in the office has to use it carefully or youll start overwriting each others work. the mixins are great and i love the nested selectors you can do. variables are pretty great as well. you really have nothing to lose by trying it out but once you do it will feel like a chore to write normal css.,css,ck3bfku,2,t5_2qifv

2058552,0,t3_2iefqm,Well your doing a few things you dont need to. a full page background image doesnt need a div around it. You can put it in the body css basically like a so        body      backgroundurl  center center norepeat        backgroundattachment fixed            The backgroundattachment fixed will keep in from scrolling center center should put it dead center in the page. As far as the squishing the issue is likely the difference in size. Most phones when vertical do not have the width for an average image. So when your site shrinks the divs to match the media query the browser is trying to fit the image inside the div and altering its dimensions to do it. When you use percents in css it is in relation to the parent container. For example lets say you have a div id  outer and a div id  inner. now outers parent container is the body tag if you make outers height and width  it will be  of the body tags height and width. Now if you make inners height and width  it will still only get as big as the outers height and width. So inners size will be at most  of the body tag. Its the same with that image tag. Personally your best bet is to use the background css property and add your image that way. ,css,cl1hjig,2,t5_2qifv

2064152,0,t3_2igdcz,Well a quick way to fix your problem is just make your widths consistent.

4876765,0,t3_3hnfg0,I guess you could do something like that with CSS but it would be super confusing.  Pure CSS is really limited in terms of parallax ability.You could use JS to do this pretty easily.  Just put the little planes on the page and set their positions absolutely.  Then update their positions on scroll events.  If you want them to fly in an arc from one point on the map to another as you scroll down you just need to pull up that knowledge on nonlinear equations from highschool algebra and replace x and y with top and left or whatever.,css,cu99659,1,t5_2qifv

8198929,0,t3_4rhi5j,Im viewing this on mobile so Im not sure that I see this page correctly. Anyhow the paragraphs seem very wide to me. A rule of thumb is  characters per line of text. You dont want to have too many characters in a line as that would force the reader to move their eyes across the entire screen when moving on to a new line thus causing them to lose their progress. Too few characters per line and the reader has to move their eyes rapidly back and forth causing them to become tired. I recommend experimenting with different widths to see what would be best but a rule of thumb is  characters. Other than that I would recommend that you get rid of the alerts as they have no practical use and are only keeping your users from actually entering your website.I used to be just like you friend.

9595430,0,t1_d9vacc6,Based on your example here it looks like your real issue is that your HTML is not very semantic. Youre just willynilly using elements as containers to apply styles.You above example should look more something like thisltdiv classcontainergt    ltp classcontentgt        lthgtHellolthgt            World!    ltpgtltdivgtI cant think of a reason youd ever need a content and subcontainer wrapper around content. You dont really even need a class on the paragraph element in my suggestion.Dont get me wrong here I understand this was probably an extreme example to illustrate your point but you might want to take a hard look at your HTML before you worry about your styling. It could pay off in SEO boost readability of code and simplifying your CSS.p.s.

10210851,0,t3_5m66d4,Thats an interesting question.not a list but in general you can think of it like this If Im applying a rule to affect the children it will be inherited but if it affects the object of my selector it will notI.E. Padding rules will add padding directly to the div or span or whatever youve selected. Color however will not affect the div at all and only affect the children in that case text.I could see that getting confusing though like bordercollapse would affect the cells of the table you selected to apply it to so children... but not a table you placed in one of those cells. But in general I think the above rule should work.,css,dc1gh7b,2,t5_2qifv

Why do you think setting everything to zero cures all ills?In his case the problem is not that he didnt set everything to zero ahead of time but that hes unaware of margins and margin collapse and not handling it as he should.
