291715,0,t3_1xf8rs,When I was pregnant at  I was usually treated fine I would sometimes get a dirty look here and there but  of the time it was fine. The only real issue was this one night I was on the bus going back home from my boyfriends I was barely showing around the beginning of tri I think so I just sat down and started reading one of those what to expect when youre expecting books when this girl came up to me out of nowhere saying I should miscarry my family should disown me I put shame to everyone that I associate with and that if my child were to be born ill be a shit parent and will give my child up for adoption cause I wouldnt care at all. After this she got off and I broke down crying and not a single person stepped up for me or asked if I was okay. ,TeenParenting,cfb01hb,2,t5_2zpe9
