Meaning if I copy and paste it the newly pasted spawner will not be spawning all previously welded props only the first one. So this is unusable. Same as above but weld props with WireLib Weld instead of native Gmod weld. Solves the problem of incomplete spawning but sometimes the spawned contraption violently flies away the moment it appears instead of just sitting in place as it should. The direction of flying seems to be constant but I dont know how to avoid that. Sometimes it does sometimes it does not. Not very usable.,gmod,coqwwtd,1,t5_2r1m6

4421147,0,t1_csn8yg9,Fair enough weve all been there!Going a bit out of order here but when adding something be sure to put the file in the correct folder. Typically when you unpack content or download content from Facepunch For example it will be in specific folders and you want to follow that path when adding it to  your server.So for exampleI say example because sometimes files wont need to be put in the player folder if Im adding a new playermodel and the filepath goesgtmodelsplayerdeltaxOrgtmodelsdeltaxIll want to add all the Model contents from the deltax folder .mdl.phy.sw.vtx.vvd .dx.vtx and .dx.vtx to the player folder located inside the models folder. Clicking and dragging deltax into the player folder should be enough. If a player folder doesnt exist inside the models folder feel free to make one.Then youll want to do the same for the texture files which are .vtf and .vtm files. These go into the materials folder and may also follow a specific path.When adding contentWhether it be models textures or scripts from your computer to your server you must websync for them to take effect to do this you go to your control panel on NFO and under the first set of options Directly under Events Log there should be a button called Websync what you want to do is click Sync Files and then youre done.Lastly after making sure all that is said and done youll want to make it so your players download said content for this youll want to navigate to your luaautorun folder and create a new .lua file for simplicity sake lets just call it addfile.Here is where youll want to add files to your fastdl so that players joining are able to download the content youve added Cause seeing untextured propsweapons or models and error signs isnt fun.To do this you can type it out manually for all the items involved in the model or content youre adding like so    if SERVER then         resource.addfile modelsplayerdeltax          resource.addfile materialsplayerdeltax     endFor simplicity sake I just did the two but youll want to include all parts of the model and textures. Since typing it out manually you might forget something Or get tired of it fast Id recommend checking out FoxWarriors Resources Generator super helpful in creating for adding stuff to your fastdl. You might have to add in custom fields to include all parts of the model but thats not a huge issue and should take you less than five minutes.,gmod,csnzy6z,2,t5_2r1m6

4703343,0,t3_3fcdlp,That means the server is using a map that requires another game. Usually its CounterStrike Source because its a game a lot of people owned back before Gmod included HalfLife  content by default. As a result a lot of maps were made with CSS content but most newer players dont own the game.You can manage without other games. You just have to find servers that dont use content from other games.At this point I really think they should include CSS content with Gmod by default because so many maps and game modes use it yet so many newer players dont have it. CSS was released over  years ago  to be specific so few people are going to buy it now.,gmod,ctne6og,-1,t5_2r1m6

All you need is the wiki page open in the background and the rest should be common sense maybe watch a few YouTube videos on server and client code and a few of the basics first but thats really it. From what you had told me which isnt much it doesnt sound like it would be very hard to code just sounds like a basic variation of the normal deathmatch gamemode.

7761979,0,t1_d3ogh9l,gtCss server?Correct when you launch SteamCMD and type in appupdate numbers youre downloading a server for that game in question. In this case it would be CSS.gtEncouraging piracyWhen you google what they suggested youll get linked to a rather large amount of videos which will suggest you visit a site that already has the textures downloaded and extracted. Which would be fine to get on your own through Valve but them redistributing them makes it pirated content.gtIt was to my understanding that all of this was clientside. That the game was merely trying to draw from files that werent there.It is clientsidewhat youre doing is extracting the models and textures from the CSS server adding them to a folder and dropping it in your addons folder. When you restart the game and go on any map that uses any models or textures on the map csoffice for example youre able to see everything properly since you have the assets somewhere in your game directory Ill be honest Im not certain if it being in addons matters or not. I assume itd be fine in materials and materialsmodels if you desire to install everything manually.gtDoes having these files constitute a different type of server that is reserved for those who have purchased CSS?It should be the same throughout itd probably be too much to keep track of on Valves end if they had seperate branches for CSS owners who wanted to own their own server and those who just want to set up a quick lan server for a game night.gtTo be honest I just want to host a lan server every now and then without the map being clown vomit and I want to do so without legal issues.I know the feeling spent a good month or two without CSS textures before I finally bought it. If you prefer to avoid spending  on a game youre unlikely to touch and want to doso legally then your best bet would be to follow the method through SteamCMD.,gmod,d3oh5xg,1,t5_2r1m6

10330694,0,t3_5ngk4h,Garrys Mod is a sandbox game based off of the framework of Half Life . The gist of it is that the more Source Engine games you install the more content you can use from other games inside gmod. It was once about building but now people mostly just kill eachother or upload poorly made fnaf pictures.,gmod,dcf1ikc,2,t5_2r1m6

10391299,0,t1_dckukej,Spot on. I just stopped playing because of fatigue and it felt different when I had another crack at it more custom HUDs and different things. Maybe its the same sort of thing that makes old people dislike new things.,gmod,dclx3zc,1,t5_2r1m6
