6193491,0,t1_cys45f4,Eh. One way to look at it  its the job of the coach to protect the insanely valuable investment that is a good QB. He retardedly tried to make a play something that all coaches should say never to do. He made a stupid mistake and its the coaches job to make him understand that that is a stupid mistake.How many times have we seen a QB injure his hand in a completely unnecessary way in a meaningless game,billsimmons,cytmupa,2,t5_2yb1h

6551849,0,t1_czx07u1,gt Colbert isnt exactly a ringing endorsement of someone who left a successful gig somewhere took a large chunk of time off then restarted somewhere else. Hes consistently beat by Jimmy Fallon and definitely lost some cachet.My point was that it usually takes  months for new shows to be created.  It was about  months for Trevor Noah to start the Daily Show after it was announced.And there really is no need to hurry.  Simmons was never really on TV.  There is no momentum to lose.  Most of his fans are listening to the podcast.  People who dont know him will just suddenly see his show on HBO and watch it or not watch it.,billsimmons,czx0jy9,2,t5_2yb1h
6620772,0,t3_453qpa,Hes got to pay for the Sports Guy Mansion somehow. And I dont mean that sarcastically. I have zero problem with the ads since Im getting something I enjoy...for free.  Bandwidth aint free and hes taking a gamble on making this thing work on his own.

9421828,0,t1_d9a0q3v,This right here. This is exactly what the issue is. Simmons doesnt offer any unique takes anymore.My thought for why more so than the downtime?

His last article seemed like it was written by a guy who hadnt written in a while. I think he just wants to be a figurehead rub elbows with famous people and let the young hungry kids do the writing.

I havent look at this years Giants indepth specifically so I cant really speak to how good they are.But heres the thing you can poke holes in many teams that are aboveaverage but not historically great. Just go through past seasons and do it to all the teams between  and  you can find flaws that keep them from being great but theyre still above average and in my book above average  good,billsimmons,dbzm5lv,1,t5_2yb1h

10257328,0,t1_dc6crcl,Hes not allowed to talk with anyone associated from ESPN so that whole team isnt able to be part of his Ringer team.  But it very much surprises me that he hasnt reached out to other repudable NBA sources like Dan Patrick The Sports Illustrated team Ben Golliver etc Ric Bucher Mike Prada from SB Nation etc...to get much more qualified NBA people to shoot the breeze with than House.

Its like hes above the common folk.Which brings me to my gripe about Simmons. Hes literally supposed to be the everyday fan one of the people thats his whole angle. But he never responds or interacts with other fans just judges them from up above on his shows. Which is fine and all hes clearly not a normal fan anymore. But just stop pretending to be one. Stop trying to speak for all fans and especially fans of other teams. It makes me cringe when he speaks for Knicks or Jets fans like he has the pulse of every city and every team. EDIT Spelling. I really need to stop ranting as soon as I wake up. ,billsimmons,dfchok1,3,t5_2yb1h
