6892042,0,t3_49yry7,Wow now theres a question.  The good news is the whole area is exploding in size and potential at the moment so if youre motivated then its almost inevitable that youll come across good opportunities. Theres a lot of hype around areas like synthetic biology but theres also a lot of reality of things moving at an incredible pace.  Feels a bit like what Id imagine the start of the IT revolution must have felt like. I would say make sure you know about the newest methods for genetic manipulations as these have blown away previous methods for genetic engineering Gibson assembly Golden Gate Assembly CRISPR TALENS are a good start. Biology is also moving increasingly into systematic engineering based on large experiments and datasets so techniques of multivariate analysis machine learning statistical analysis cant hurt.Hard question the above is just my opinion.  Good luck!,biotechnology,d0xj4e3,3,t5_2vjg3
