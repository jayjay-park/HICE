195664,0,t3_1wa3v1,Did you enable USB boot from within ChromeOS? Its not supported on all models but you have to run a command to enable Ctrl  L booting.sudo bashcrossystem devbootusb devbootlegacyThen you can try Ctrl  L with a USB drive inserted. If that doesnt work youll have to use the ChrUbuntu script.EDIT Looks like the HP  is an ARM model. Legacy USB boot is a no go.,chrubuntu,cf0q775,2,t5_2w1s5

506975,0,t1_cfxw3rq, Native. rChromeOS doesnt seem to deal heavily with modifications to the stock product. Ubuntu or not rChrubuntu seems to be the only appropriate sub for those willing to void a warranty. Yup thats why Im asking. I really havent heard a clear explanation yet as to why these things cant run. I assume its some limitation of CorebootSeaBIOS but like yourself its a bit over my head.,chrubuntu,cfxw9gg,2,t5_2w1s5

1881366,0,t1_ckfv8v7,Yeah I had looked into that. It seems something specifically about the lid opening during resume triggers a problem. I cant say I found any solution yet.,chrubuntu,ckfwbj9,1,t5_2w1s5
1917949,0,t1_ckk8gni,I wouldnt say its significantly faster since ubuntu still takes over a minute to boot up. And  gigs too small for basic functioning. Im at  of my internal and thats with just things I need. ,chrubuntu,ckkasv1,1,t5_2w1s5

1979056,0,t3_2hcpnd,The C certainly is extra challenging if you are new to linux. If you dare to ditch your warranty and wipe chromeOS it is surprisingly easy to turn this chromebook into a normal x netbook. Fully functioning fast and stable running with e.g. Ubuntu . Unity. Unless you are really using the RAM to its max I dont see why you would prefer Xubuntu over Ubuntu but that is personal of course. ,chrubuntu,ckrodri,0,t5_2w1s5

3025121,0,t3_2usvvc,I know youre already aware of it but the configs in  are the results of compiling tons of rchrubuntu threads and various blog posts plus many hours of further tweaking and testing.All for C amp mostly Ubuntu though.PS congrats on moderator status things were getting a little dusty in here. ,chrubuntu,cobjug2,2,t5_2w1s5

3078568,0,t1_cogoald,people are not understanding what that means that is for chromeOS images  kernels not for other OS linux os this kinda blew out of proportions cause it got posted in every news tech site somehow they read you will be able to install linux alongside chromeOS its not what it means.,chrubuntu,coh3ajz,1,t5_2w1s5

3339983,0,t1_cp8463w,Thank you very much for your suggestions! After I prematurely erased Ubuntu I didnt think of patching anything I thought I failed somewhere I failed installing it again. Then I tried Lubuntu started patching and only then I found Hugegreenbugs out of the box solution. I did the fullwipe version and it works like a charm but I still get the white screen with red exclamation mark at the beginning. Now SeaBIOS is not set to default and ChromeOS is gone. Do you still advise me to reinstall ChromeOS set SeaBIOS to default and then go back to my Ubuntu?Apart from the batterydraindeletesubuntu issue I dont see any security concerns since ChromeOS is gone. Would a battery drain now actually still delete my ubuntu now that ChromeOS is gone?I never have the patience to wait...am recovering now to ChromeOS will then set SeaBios as default and say goodbye to ChromeOS forever. ,chrubuntu,cp8zdy9,2,t5_2w1s5

4306157,0,t1_csawt5n,Firefox can be made to be quite light if you turn autoupdates off so your settings actually stick.

6506053,0,t3_43lgon,Ive encountered this enough times I Powerwash my Chromebook way too much. What I typically do is open the onscreen keyboard in Chrome OS settings enter the username and password then reboot the Chromebook.Mind you sometimes the mouse wont work either. For those times simply force reboot the Chromebook only the power button will work curiously and rerun the crouton script adding u to the end of it.,chrubuntu,czs9wkr,1,t5_2w1s5
