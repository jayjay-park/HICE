1090286,0,t1_chs1zzw,Okay egg carton and brains. Sooo is brains something I can get at like a grocery store or should I be friends with a butcher. What did you keep them warm with. I was going to try a heat lamp I used for a snake but I was afraid it would bake them. Im thinking maybe a heating pad under their tank and some bone meal mixed into the soil. Thank you for all the awesome info btw. ,skulls,chs7vjn,2,t5_2rskz

Sadly a few others have become secret groups because people join thinking its interesting and then become horribly offended by the things people collect and cause trouble.,skulls,cpat1el,1,t5_2rskz
3392416,0,t1_cpey71b,thats really good advice thank you. I will try to do that tomorrow there is a small dairy farm near me. Was hoping there would be a shop selling bulk bones from large animals hut didnt see any with what I need. I made a chair of all bones and want to make more to possibly sell since I have had many offers to buy the one I have. ,skulls,cpeync0,2,t5_2rskz

6970297,0,t1_d15zz8b,Its a skull. First responder correctly identified it as a snapper. In person its pretty clear that its from the head of an animal. And Im pretty familiar with bird skeletons so knew it wasnt from one of them.,skulls,d16f4mj,1,t5_2rskz
