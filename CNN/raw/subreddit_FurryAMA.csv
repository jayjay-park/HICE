1196589,0,t1_ci3i95a,Well I do try to keep a fedora on my head when I go out.  REAL fedoras not like the silly little things of your time have a wide brim and will protect you from the sun rain and the occasional falling piece of ice.  However I havent figured out yet how to make one bulletproof hence I go through new fedoras about every month or so. ,FurryAMA,ci48get,2,t5_323al
