6215179,0,t3_40pjpf,Im Type one and just stick myself at the side of my finger pad. I can barely feel it anymore. Make sure the lancet is sharp and if you pinch your finger pad first its fine. ,GestationalDiabetes,cyw3kod,1,t5_2w321

6469666,0,t1_cw8poxc,I know this is an old thread so not sure youll get this...I was just diagnosed and we are damn near paleo as well! I really resisted the diagnosis because of course I cant drink a bottle of sugar and process it an hour...thats not something My pancreas is used to.  But here we are. I wonder if they are related...the glucose test seems really onesizefitsall and doesnt account for those of us who dont follow a standard diet.  Maybe? ,GestationalDiabetes,czoicgz,1,t5_2w321
6955161,0,t1_d14kpvc,Either that or they have different standards for gestational diabetes vs what they tell me. those kinds of numbers were sort of standard for me last pregnancy and this one so far. I had absolutely zero diabetes related complications last time. Fingers crossed everything goes well with this one too.I guess its possible they dont want to scare type s though because sometimes you just get down to . Or one mistake will leave you at . The goal is ever tighter control but its sort of like chasing the dragon towards the end because you need more and more until that placenta is gone.,GestationalDiabetes,d14p8mp,1,t5_2w321

7786816,0,t1_d3r9j6i,I shake my hands below my waist for a couple of minutes to get blood flowing. Seems to do better that way.,GestationalDiabetes,d3ralvr,1,t5_2w321
8415495,0,t1_d5tg9sg,So are you basing the pain on when your mom used to do it?  Maybe she was being more foreceful than necessary? Some tips    ampnbsp        The sides of the finger hurt less than the pads     Get a lancing device a needle pen with multiple depth settings.  use the shallowest setting that still draws blood      Washing your hands in warm water will get the blood flowing and allow you to use a shallower setting with good results      drop your arms shake your hands and hold the base of your finger until the blood pools before you test.  This will also help you use a shallower setting       If youre not getting any blood with the shallow settings with the tips above get a thicker gague lancet      Dont rub your finger with alcohol beforehand.  This dries the skin and makes it more painful.    ampnbsp     My ritual is this      I use the bayer microlet  lancing device with bayer microlet lancets they have a thick gauge but are silicone coated.       I leave the lancing device setup from my previous test as dealing with the needle when Im about to test stresses me out.      I wash my hands in hot water and shake them vigorously.      I setup the test strip then drop my arm and hold the base of the finger Im going to test.     I wipe the sweat off  P  with a piece of paper towel then prick on the side of the finger.     Once the strip has enough blood I use the same paper towel to put pressure on the prick for a few seconds it stops bleeding immediately.       I write down my results dispose of the strip and needle in a glass container and set up the lancing device for the next round.  ,GestationalDiabetes,d5thati,1,t5_2w321

8652437,0,t1_d6n0nt5,Second paragraph is my experience. I failed  of the  draws the  hour. My OBs nurse said that means GD my MFM different practice said its not but I might develop it later. I tested early  hour was at w. I am going to my first class next week but started testing with the glucometer I already had at home and my HIGHEST postmeal reading is . So I think Im fine but am still going to go through the classes for tips and continue testing my glucose after various types of meals to see how I do with different foods. ,GestationalDiabetes,d6n62fd,1,t5_2w321
8663631,0,t3_4yl54d,Absolutely. I want to see some celebration over here!!Am I the only one though who isnt looking forward to postGD meals? I know the GD should go away and Ill be expected to eat normally but I have a lot of anxiety even thinking about a bowl of pasta or ice cream and am kind of worried Im never going to be able to really enjoy those kinds of foods again. Not because I couldnt force it down but because Id be too nervous for it to be delicious and fun.,GestationalDiabetes,d6okln4,8,t5_2w321

11095771,0,t1_depmkt5,I guess I have no problem with them being a little more conservative with fasting numbers since my babys health is concerned but damn it I was so stressed out seeing those numbers over  and that couldnt have been good for baby either!

11356728,0,t1_dfj766q,Ill ask if the GD and insulin mean its more likely the placenta is deteriorating at a faster rate but besides that.... If I keep my numbers under control Id rather get to my due date.,GestationalDiabetes,dfj9iub,1,t5_2w321
