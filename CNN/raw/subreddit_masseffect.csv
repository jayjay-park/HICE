20798,0,t3_1ucjxa,I think that Mass Effect needs some more weapon variety. Instead of  Human weapons but only  Asari ones there should be at least one of each kind of weapon for each race including heavy weapons. I also believe that there could be different armours that affect weight and combat agility. Heavier armours lower power recharge speed but increase damage done with weapons that weigh more and light armour would allow the player to combat roll or leap depending on their race increase power recharge and damage done with lighter weapons.Now back to the topic of Weapons for each race. I was thinking that each race could have a base weapon and modified a modified weapon for each weapon class. Example Quarian WeaponsSniper Rifles Javelin Base Quarian Arc Rifle A weaker Javelin that shoots  chargeable shots per mag the shots cause an overload like effect to the target and surrounding enemiesAssault Rifles Geth Plasma Rifle Base Quarian Antipersonnel Rifle Semiauto Plasma rifle that shoots  shots per mag the shots can pierce armourSubmachine Guns Geth Plasma SMG Base Korris SMG A Plasma SMG with shots that track the target and rarely missShotguns Geth Plasma Shotgun Base Shredder Shotgun An antipersonnel shotgun that can be charged to fire up to  shots at onceHeavy Pistols Arc Pistol Base Zorah Revolver A slow firing shot plasma revolver that can be charged to fire  shots in successionHeavy Weapons Arc Projector  Reegar Carbine You know how these two workNote In this example the Quarians based their new weapons off of Geth weapons because the Geth weapons were designed for Antipersonnel use while most Quarian weapons were used for Antisynthetic purposes so dont call me a GethHater for making then the base of almost all weapons.,masseffect,cegsues,3,t5_2rc19

25618,0,t1_cehbxnv, Technically there was a choice D. The every choice was supposed to matter line of criticism really fails to hold up. Yes Bioware puffed their chests and made some unfortunate sound bites and backofthebox quotes when they were advertising their game. But really? Every choice? Was Helena Blake supposed to show up and talk about how her life of social workcriminal retirement was going? If you talked to the Vorcha on Omega in Mass Effect  were we supposed to see the Vorcha throwing an Ewoklike festival at the end?... Actually that last bit sounds pretty awesome now that I think on it. BIOWARE MAKE IT HAPPEN.In the EC they did a slide show which fit this bill. Yes it was lowrent but they did take your major actions into account and changed the epilogue accordingly. And your choices reverberated throughout the games in other ways too. Most of the time it simply ended up as a War Asset boost. This was a clumsy system but its actually typical of the smoke and mirrors developers use to simulate choice as true divergence is prohibitively expensive to make in games especially big budget AAA fare.Still the vanilla endings really robbed the player of agency the feeling that our choices mattered. Speak to the vague and nonsensical Starchild fire a multicolored beam destroy the relays no matter what and thereby doom the galaxy to a thousand years of darkness and watch as your ship and crew who mysteriously teleported back to the Normandy somehow crash lands on some random world. Do they starve? Do they start a new civilization? SHUT UP ITS ART. Cue credits Buzz Aldrin says some stuff and then a message pops up saying BUY MOAR DLC EA GAMES EVER!!! Or something.EC ending isnt perfect or even great but Id argue that it gets the job done. At the very least it does not fail nearly as much as the vanilla ending.Ask yourself are you criticizing the revised ending or are you still reacting to the original ending?

31009,0,t1_cehkyfq,Their behavior was so curious in the first game. The way theyd randomly rearrange peoples work amp living spaces or how theyd quickly amp efficiently repair the Citadel... its very intriguing. I hoped wed venture with Shepard into the keeper tunnels to discover a trove of data on earlier cycles. Perhaps find artifacts technology or weapons meticulously stored in large containment bays. Going off on my own headspace how cool would it have been to find out from Vendetta Thessia Prothean VI that the keepers had claimed and stored the Catalyst to fire the Crucible. As suspected they are the minions controlled by the Reaper Impetus i.e. the Star Child and were commanded to hide away key elements of the crucible plan.Upon entering the Keeper tunnels you realize these seemingly benign creatures become vicious when encroached upon in their sanctuary. Theyre main method of attack is to overwhelm by swarming think Starship Troopers. Fighting through them Shepard comes upon the cloning facility where the unreaperized Keeper species is locked in stasis for genetic resourcing. The originals are bipedial amphibanlike aliens with mandibles but articulating jaw. Their reaperized counterparts are two of these small creatures fuzed together their jaws amp vocalizing organs removed with their exterior protected by a malleable exoskeleton. Within the Keeper archives lies fragments from other societies including plans that outline discovery and true nature of the Reapers from several cycles evidence of some crosscycle assembly of a thoughttobedead race with newly galactic races to preempt a the harvest with the reaper counter measure that would become the Crucible.Or maybe a Prothean in stasis who was too important to die. Now would have been a helluva mission to recruit Javik.Eh one could dream all day. ,masseffect,cehyngc,2,t5_2rc19
32862,0,t1_cehweel,In terms of the DLC Leviathan and Citadel are both very good... Id consider Leviathan necessary to the story. Citadel isnt vital to the main plot but its damn good.    I dont place all of my trust in reviews especially from major gaming sites. I dont buy the argument people make about how theyre all bought off by the publishers though... well except maybe IGN.    I prefer the reviews that are from fairly reputable tech journalism sites to most of the purely gaming operations usually. Places like Ars Technica and Polygon  The Verge tend to have pretty well thought out features.    I dont think ME is perfect or even close to perfect. Neither are the other games really. I still think the Starchild is a silly plot device... actually so is the human reaper from the ending of ME though that had less effect on the series as a whole. I hate the Starchild a lot less with Leviathan and the EC though    Even now a lot of people get angry at the ending because of how stupid the Catalysts logic regarding how conflict is inevitable and therefore it should kill or preserve everyone first. I see that a lot but depending on how you interpret it and supported by Leviathan the Catalyst seeming illogical is somewhat intentional. Its presented less as a last minute exposition device and more as an enemy  as a rogue AI.    I still wouldnt have ended the series that way and I maintain that Synthesis is nonsensical not to mention a ripoff of the ending of the Matrix but Destroy at least and Control too I suppose with that interpretation in mind which includes some skepticism of the Catalysts shtick about all synthetic life being destroyed for no reason is at least a fitting ending.    Aside from the ending... I didnt like the DLC model but the DLCs themselves were for the most part good enough to justify their asking price. I didnt mind that they used an almost precisely human photo for Tali as such since humans looking very much like quarians was already established canon but I wish they either used their own concept art which they had or at least done a better job with the photoshopping dat hand.    The multiplayer is pretty good inandofitself but you dont actually need it for the endings anyway with EC its trivial to have enough EMS.    I felt there were plenty of substantive missions but it was organised differently to previous games. In ME there were a tonne of UNC sidequests but they were all in cookie cutter layouts and for the most part were uninteresting. ME had fewer and they were better designed. I dont count recruitment  loyalty missions as sidequests  theyre really part of the main story. ME has possibly slightly fewer of those sidequests though I enjoyed the N missions a fair bit.    I wont really compare ME because its a very different game but ME really only had five or so main missions Freedoms Progress Horizon Collector Station Derelict Reaper Suicide Mission. The loyalty  recruitment missions just guessing thered be  or so of those if you combine the two types were where the game really shone.    ME didnt have comparable loyalty missions but the main missions were much more substantive. Aside from fetch quests and N side missions there are also some missions that Id consider tangential and which arent necessary for the games completion like Grissom Academy Tuchanka Bomb Rannoch Geth Fighter Squadrons Rannoch Admiral Koris Gellix ExCerberus Scientists the ArdatYakshi monastery. In terms of time spent I easily spent as much time completing MEs campaign as I did MEs. So I dont really consider it unsubstantial.    As to the games themes... most of them were carried through with. Certainly the themes underlying the Genophage and quarian  geth arcs were. The Dark energy theme wasnt followed through on but that only really came up in one or two conversations in ME anyway.  In general yeah I dont think that there werent parts of ME that couldnt have been better. If the game had gone with a year release cycle rather than a year one would we have seen a better ending and more resolution to things like the Rachni arc? I dont know. But what really elevated it for me was the character writing. ME greatly improved on the depth of characters from ME but the characters in ME are practically alive theyre written so well.,masseffect,cei68ch,2,t5_2rc19

96817,0,t1_ceorlde,gtWhen it comes down to it I always choose high EMS destroy. I feel like its a pretty selfish choice though to be honest. I dont want my Shep to die and leave Liara alone.I actually thought about this a fair bit when I chose Control with my Shep and came to a conclusion that I was reasonably happy with. Basically I cant imagine that the Reapers being such advanced computerbased living creatures wouldnt have some sort of backup system for their programming so after Shepards personality got assimilated there would be a short period of time where they would have the ability to separate out all of the files related to Shepards inclusion in their systems. From there its not hard to imagine that they could make a Shepard clone either robotic or at least partially organic so that Shepard can live out hisher days with hisher man or ladylove. Children after that would probably be impossible but your romantic interest wouldnt be alone and Shepard could be with all of your friends. And at that point the Reapers help rebuild the galaxy to make up for everything they destroyed then leave forever.I could just never justify to myself the destruction of all the Geth after I worked so hard to save them and give them a chance to prove their peaceful intentions and EDI was such a huge stepping stone to show how AIs could very easily be just as good as the rest of us. Synthesis also seemed weird in that I wanted to let people come to that conclusion on their own even though it obviously seems like the best result organics getting all the good parts of synthetic technology and synthetics getting improvements from organics.,masseffect,cepgamq,1,t5_2rc19

If you dont mind Id like to ask some additional questions so that I may get a fuller understanding of your personal situation and then we can work toward finding you a solution.First of all what kind of things were you trying to mod?

The excessive cooldown bonuses are mainly to make Flare somewhat spamable and they really make a difference there it recharges in under  seconds. If I end up switching it out for another power though Ill consider your suggestion about Power Mastery.Armor piercing mods may be a better choice its true particularly because I mainly use my gun to take down big baddies like Brutes Atlases Banshees and Harvesters. I used the Extended Clip on the Lancer on previous playthroughs but on Insanity the Lancer just doesnt do enough damage and staying out of cover for extended periods usually results in a quick death so Ive been considering switching it out for a higher powerpershot weapon like a sniper rifle or specialized gun. Suggestions on these would be more than welcome. ,masseffect,cetqgxd,1,t5_2rc19
139836,0,t3_1vn0fs,Hopefully this isnt too late but whatever you do if importing a save from ME to ME DO NOT ATTEMPT TO EDIT YOUR FACE. Seriously unless you absolutely hate the face you have and are willing to put in the time creating a whole new one do not even go into the face editing screen. Doing so will mean that your ME face will be all out of whack and there is no easy fix to it.Semitechnical details ME and ME rely on face codes to display your face. ME does not have displayable face codes it keeps the slider values hidden. When ME imports a ME save it reads the slider values but does not generate a matching face code so if you look at the squad screen Shep will not have a face code. The problem is when you enter the edit screen a ghost face code will be attached to your profile and it cannot be deleted only overridden by creating a whole new face. When importing into ME if the ghost face code is attached it will read that one and your Shep will come out all wonky looking. The patch that was released fixes the problem of NOT having a face code as ME could not originally import a non edited MEME save but can do nothing about the ghost face code issue.,masseffect,ceucvbb,2,t5_2rc19

233130,0,t1_cf4w6lv,Thanks for adding your perspective.This isnt quite related to the topic at hand but theres one part I want to questiongtAlso Destroy does not solve the organicsynthetic conflict which has been shown to be common to all advanced civilizations spanning millions of years. Without something to stop it it will happen again. Knowing about it is no guarantee against it.My question is how do you know that it is in fact inevitable as the Catalyst says?Theres very little to corroborate it in our own cycle. In our cycle there are three known examples of synthetic life. EDI in her original incarnation as the Luna VIspoiler EDI acted hostile as wshe was becoming selfaware. Its worth noting that theres nothing that inherently suggests EDI was in fact fully sapient at this point. Nor is much about her reasoning known. Why did she turn on the personnel of the facility? Who knows maybe they tried to shut her off. Regardless once the AI becomes EDI she does nothing but attempt to foster good relations with organics. Surely as she is a freewilled sapient it is offensive to suggest that her behaviour can be predicted in a way such that one could say that she would with no room for doubt at some point turn on organics. Is EDI any more certain to turn against organics than any other character is to turn evil?. the geth. The geth did not rebel against the quarians  the quarians attempted to exterminate them imposing martial law and incarcerating or executing quarians who attempted to protect geth. The geth fought only in retaliation and did not seek to exterminate the quarians but merely prevent their own extinction. That doesnt absolve them of blame as Im sure they did plenty of awful things to quarians during the resulting Morning War. But the war was caused by the same thinking the Catalyst employs  that synthetics and organics cannot coexist so a preemptive strike is required.. the AIs on the Citadel prior to the ban on AI research as shown in Citadel these AIs were exterminated by the Council after the Morning war. As far as were shown they had never shown any tendency towards rebellion or violence. Its presented as nothing less than an ethnic cleansing of undesirable AIs on the part of the Council.What we do have from this cycle is evidence that syntheticorganic peace is possible. The geth and the quarians can make peace and EDI can make peace with organics. Sure the Catalyst believes that these will be temporary. But theres no evidence for that.Its like pointing out that at a point in the past the United States of America was at war with Britain. Sure they now coexist as allies but whos to say they wont go to war again at some point? Sure its possible that war between those two countries will break out. But surely nobody would suggest that its inevitable with no corroborative evidence.But it gets worse. There are very few known examples in the Mass Effect universe of true synthetic versus organic conflict. Ironically the only known example of a synthetic directly rebelling against its creators and exterminating them is the Catalyst itself. Other known examples exist but they were all directly caused by the Reapers.The Geth War of  was an example of synthetic versus organic conflict. But that was caused by the Reapers manipulating a segment of the geth Consensus. Had the Reapers not approached the geth there never would have been a geth war.Javik tells a similar story about his cycle  about a species called the Zha who lived on a dying world. To save themselves they augmented themselves with machine technology including mental augmentations. They became a hybrid organicsynthetic race called the Zhatil. The Zhatil ended up in conflict with the Prothean empire... because the Reapers had manipulated  indoctrinated them into becoming their pawns.So pretty much every known specific case in the Mass Effect universe of actual Synthetic rebellion or even SyntheticOrganic conflict in general is caused by the Reapers themselves. The only suggestion of other syntheticorganic conflict comes from the Catalyst when it makes vague claims about life prior to instituting the Cycle  it claims that conflict always broke out which was why the Cycle was required.So the only evidence to corroborate the Catalysts claim that syntheticorganic conflict is inevitable... is the Catalysts own assertion that it is true. Why should we trust it?,masseffect,cf4wvnq,8,t5_2rc19

361112,0,t3_1y73c3,I dont think Flare adds much to the Adept personally. They already have so many powers that can detonate that the only things Flare really adds are the shieldsbarriers damage evo and the ability to blow up enemies hiding behind walls and even then you need a way of priming them through said wall for it to be worth it. Cluster Grenades have a large area of effect no cooldown and do substantially more damage per cast so really their only downside is that ammo is limited. In  out of  situations Cluster Grenades are just as good if not better because they dont halt your power usage.Now on the Vanguard you have a ranged biotic detonator that acts sort of like a projectile Nova except you dont sacrifice your Barriers. For when you dont want to rush headfirst into clusters of enemies suddenly Flare becomes invaluable as it gives you an option at mid to long range. Enemies in the singleplayer like to attack in clusters so one Warp courtesy of Liara  she should always accompany a Flarewielding Vanguard Flare combo is usually enough to take out all enemies and if not you can use your other powers and your shotgun of choice to pick off any stragglers.tldr Flare is much more useful on the Vanguard than it is on the Adept IMO.,masseffect,cfi71ah,1,t5_2rc19

414499,0,t1_cfnoc19,gt I thought that Synthesis was a skeezy ending long before I bothered looking into how other players felt about the game end. Theres just something about making a decision for every organic ever that just turns my stomach. No can do.The single worst thing about the Synthesis ending to me is about how Bioware seemed to position it at the end of the series. Its like a false prophet of what many Shepards not all but many worked towards throughout the series  real unity collective strength drawing strength from one another  not being a uniform entity etc. Its put in front of you as this GIGANTIC GLEAMING BEAM. Thats what I hated about it... in fact the lack of understanding at what exactly was fucking happening as I went through the final sequences led me to just choose that beam. I favored destroy much better after thinking through it and I consider that my Shepards canon ending but that beam and what Bioware seemed to want it to say attracted me like a fly to a lightbulb. I hated that and it soured me forever on the Synthesis ending.,masseffect,cfnq8fb,4,t5_2rc19

Usual renegade Shepard isnt an insane soldier with no regard for life hes just pragmatic and a badass.

No. Fucking. Sense.I once tried a playthrough with the mindset that this was a Shepard who really would murder billions to ensure humanitys survival.

446479,0,t1_cfqsyjz,Thanks! It was fairly simple actually. I had some leftover fabric paint from another project a few months back but had painted it freehand. I wanted something a bit more officiallooking so I researched online how to make a suitable stencil.I did a couple things differently though. When I found the exact logos I wanted  raw .svg files instead of shiny renderings  I turned off all the lights in the room and taped the freezer paper directly to my monitor with blue painters tape making a sort of rearprojecting system. With a very light touch I sketchedtraced the outline onto the paper with a pencil.Next I peeled the tape and paper in one piece from the screen and stuck it onto a pane of glass I pulled it out of an empty picture frame. I then carefully cut out the stencil with an XActo knife using the glass as a cutting surface and an old gift card as a straightedge. Curved areas had to be cut freehand.I then followed the instructions on the website and paint bottle  iron the stencil onto the shirt paint  coats  but in my impatience I pulled the stencil off when the paint seemed dry. Didnt seem to hurt anything though.Nothing against Bioware or their merchandise department but this is exactly what I want out of an N shirt and cost me . and .hr. ,masseffect,cfr1jmh,4,t5_2rc19

Liara who was her love invites a now retired SpectreN agent to come live with her and to help her with her Shadow Broker work.

639370,0,t1_cgcwy8j,I can say that the Citadel banned all AI and are extremely thorough at stamping them out. In all of ME we find  AIs the council missed both being VERY short lived. The credit thief AI was stamped out by Shepard and the Luna AI was in the process of being stamped out. It is established on several occasions including over Rannoch in ME that by themselves the Geth programs are just dumb VIs. The Geth only become an AI when a mass amount of them are linked as a gestalt hive mind. Legion mentions many times how there is only one Geth in ME. I source the above for no nonReaper AI active by the end of ME as any ones created by Organics would have a laughably small chance of surviving council persecution and the war while the surviving Geth are in isolated fragments and thus dumb VIs. Although this one is harder to directly source Bioware stated that it did not effect VIs in response to criticism pointing out how there was no possible explanation as to whyhow it would happen as well as how without VIs anywhere  of the galaxy was doomed. ,masseffect,cgcy3sj,2,t5_2rc19

I did manage to produce a couple lines Id never heard before on my recent th time through ME though I do engineer each playthrough just to try and see new content each time heh.On the other hand if youve only played ME once there is tons of content that you havent seen yet. In fact if you just cant stomach playing either of the first two games again simply starting a raw ME game without a save import will make the game rather drastically different.Or if youre willing to play the first games again or just ME along with a save editor then make totally different choices than you did for your first ME save import and go again. Some possibilities Obviously making lots of the opposite morality choices in general. Killing certain squadmates can have a pretty big impact in ME. Tali is probably the biggest since Admiral Xen takes over for her dialog on the dreadnought. Keeping squadmates alive without doing their loyalty missions or intentionally failing them where possible can also lead to some new scenes andor dialog when you meet them in ME. Of course on the action side playing a class thats very different from the one you first played in ME will mix things up.

810688,0,t1_cgvqgrv,The heat death of the galaxy is a minor problem when compared with the heat death of the universe. Heat death is likely unavoidable any impact living things will have on the universes march towards silence is nothing compared to what the universe itself is doing. This would be like trying stop an ocean full of water from evaporating by trapping and keeping one extra molecule of water every  years. It would be far better to attempt to utilize as many resources as possible as quickly as possible to attempt to solve the problem. The only way a dark energy problem could be inserted into the story is if the reapers had come to the galaxy to harvest all the matter it could for a super computer sort of like a swarm of locusts. But then you have to come up with a reason why the cycles exist. Maybe we just have to face off against a small Reaper fleet that planned on conquering then building up their forces. My own opinion is that the reapers should have just stayed giant mysterious death machines. Not quite a Lovecraftian style enemy as in a video game you want to win but something of a similar mystique. Although finding out specific aspects about the Reapers was cool the whole back story thing really took the wind out of the sails for me. We fight or we die is pretty much all the motivation I needed to fight them. Other aspects of the story would not need to be changed. The Reapers could still be responsible for the citadel cycles etc. We would just never quite figure out why any of it was done. We would know why they want everyone to use tech based on what they left behind easier to defeat but we wont know why they have to fight in the first place. The story arch could have concentrated more on exploring Reaper weaknesses and the heartbreak of war coming together for a common cause etc. Rather then well we need to build a magical device so that we can press a button and all go home because the Reapers really arent that spectacular. ,masseffect,cgwfh2n,4,t5_2rc19

I imagine their woodwinds would be a lot shorter than ours but would have more holes that could be covered up in more combinations to make different pitches making up for their fewer fingers. Since theyre so math oriented theyre probably big on harmony so I like to imagine their instruments would be split in two halves able to harmonize with itself.The turians probably would have developed their instruments out of military tradition. Drums to keep tempo in battle and bugles to sound out commands are simple percussion or valve based and wouldnt be a problem for the turians due to their less fingers.The quarians have been adrift for so long their music has probably changed quite a bit. They obviously cant blow into instruments and if they are practicing their music on their pilgrimage it has to be portable. I would go as far to say that the flotilla might not have any musicians and singing and dancing which Tali says is important to the quarians might be their only form of musical art practiced in their off time and performed in between duties so as not to take away from the flotillas needed tasks.,masseffect,cgyqhy5,2,t5_2rc19

Think about it. Edis combatoriented super robot body can crush armor but shes restricted to SMGs and pistols. Yet the sickly Quarian mechanics are totting shotguns.It just seems like there could be more done to align weight focus and power with the themes of the different characters and races.If there are better ways to accomplish that then I welcome them.,masseffect,ch8v1jq,2,t5_2rc19

Well its that kind of crap that makes men who dont have sex drives that go through the roof feel like theyre worthless especially when they end up with a woman who has a high sex drive. Your argument is pretty poor to be perfectly honest since how men view women has a lot more to do with personal hormonal chemistry experiences and up bringing. Youre generalizing men as much as you are women.Also youre assuming that Im a single prudish man hating probably ugly feminazi when Im most certainly not. I never once said anything against men as a gender but I did say something against men who can only value a woman by whether or not hed put his dick in her. If youre offended by that then frankly I dont care what you think because that means that it probably rings true for you and that you justify it by any means possible and arent really interested in anything I say because Im a silly naive woman.

Its easier to project your own attitudes and emotions onto the words he says as more of a blank slate. Sort of an everyman I guess.Ive also heard that some people prefer him when playing paragade for that reason  its easier to believe that its the same guy saying these different things.

During the mission Shepard learned that Kasumi wasnt up to the standards she required. Kasumi was deemed to be tactically naive and inept. As such Kasumi was left on the bench for the whole mission and would only be used as a last resort. After the deaths of Jack and Thane aboard the Normandy Shepard had no option but to bring her along to the assault on the Collector base. Shepard decided that she would be most useful escorting the crew back to the Normandy knowing that he had cleared a safe path for her and the crew. Mordin is a doctor sure and arguably would be more suited to the task but he is more handy with a gun than Kasumi is.

1397109,0,t1_circvep,I should start by saying that I dont think the Catalyst is true AI at all. It seems to follow a very rigid notion of implementing its directive at any cost. To me its seems much more shackled than EDI or the AI from the side mission in ME. It even kills its own creators because orders are orders. This is another reason I dont think its being deceptive. The reason it helps Shepard is because their goals are the same at that moment. The Catalyst would readily get rid of the reapers if there were a better solution. Shepard is its better solution. I believe it even states outright that the reapers are an imperfect solution. Moreover the Catalyst is as much a narrative device as it is anything else. It unravels the final mystery as to why the reapers exist. It gives you the context of the decision youre about to make and the journey youre now at the end of leaving aside what some feel are the inadequacies of these closing scenes. Bioware didnt put that in to trick you but to give you the understanding of what it is youre doing. The ECs even show that the Catalyst was not being deceptive. The reapers dont continue the harvest or maintain control maybe in Control but again reapershep. To me the game logic shows no reason to suspect that the Catalyst is secretly indoctrinating you or lying about the potential outcomes of your decisions. That concept still sounds like indoctrination theory to me.The reason the Leviathans created the Catalyst was to find a solution to the problem of their thralls getting wiped out by their own synthetic creations. The problem again is that synthetics are wiping out their organic creators. Yes the Leviathans only cared because they were losing thralls but that doesnt change the fact that these conflicts were occurring. Are you saying that you believe the enthrallment brought about the conflicts? At any rate maybe these conflicts couldve been brought to a diplomatic end much like the Geth and Quarians. Im not saying they couldnt be. But these synthetic life forms will surpass their organic counterparts and without mutual progression I dont think mutual peace will last very long.Check this video at the  mark. The Catalyst spells out exactly what the problem is before going on about his awesome harvest solution,masseffect,cirepso,1,t5_2rc19

One possible ending idea that I wouldve really liked was a super low war assets ending where Hackett calls you up in private before the final push and says Look Shepard our asses are gonna fry if we go through with our original plan we need a new one . And you have the option of going through with the original plan If you just manage to squeak by in war assets you can kill the Reapers but pretty much everybody dies in the process or proposing a new one Ram the Crucible into the Charon relay ala Arrival thereby destroying Sol and the Citadel but also taking out the vast majority of Reaper forces Obviously there would be stragglers but they might not even be able to function with Starkid and Harbinger blown to smithereens . It wouldve been a great pyyrhic victory and it wouldve been interesting to see the reactions of the other races to the Humans sacrificing everything theyd ever known for  of their existence in order to beat the Reapers.On the opposite end of the spectrum Like were talking every possible war asset  . Everything goes as it was aside from having a much better final mission including plenty of appearances of all the races you brought together until you get to the starkid at which point you can make a reputation check that basically says No fuck your choices shut down the Reapers if you have any sense of justice. Your solution was always doomed to failure and youve committed atrocities against trillions of innocent beings. Ive done in a few years what you failed to do in millions.

1451764,0,t3_2appx3,You know if theres one studio that I can respect in this shitpit of a gaming industry filled with anticonsumerism its probably Bioware because there are no other studios apart from perhaps Valve or CDPR that treat writing as an integral and crucial part of the game and there are pretty much no major studios that hide dedicated writing teams aside from Bioware.That being said they have to walk a line here. While I do want a rigorous peer review process for the story like the previous games with the minor exception of ME had I do NOT want the story subject to our whims as the fans. Story is a near completely subjective thing and speaking as an author myself I would never want to tell my fellow artists how to tell the story they dream of telling with a few exceptions of course. There are some cardinal rules.. But I would like to give some advice on the front of gameplay because thats a little more objective. For example Id like a lot more freedom in exploration because as the series went on Mass Effect got more and more linear and less of an RPG until ME was basically Gears of War when it came to missions. I still enjoyed it but a lot less than I did MEs combat or MEs actualy being an ActionRPG and not just an action game with RPG elements.Please Bioware just make sure youre giving it your all.

1476894,0,t1_cj16nf8,From Ashes was rehashed from content that was otherwise going to be cuthad already been cut because of changes to the story specifically the ending.In an earlier version of the story Javik WAS the catalyst with regard to operating the crucible there was no explanation or controlling intelligence behind the Reapers.spoiler ME cut content  After the story changed his character and all his content was cut completely even though a lot of it had already been created such as the VOs.  When they reused it for the From Ashes DLC it was already integrated fairly seamlessly with a lot of the other parts of the game where his dialogue didnt reference his role in the parts of the games story that were cut.As to why they made it DLC and didnt still include it with the base game that has more to do with the development process.  The base game has to be done about  months before the street date to account for things like certification approval ESRB PEGI etc and time to print and ship the disks.  Content lock is generally another month or two before that so there is adequate time to test and debug the game.  This basically leaves  months before the launch date that the development team cant add anymore content to the shipped game.  What they can do is work on DLC or go on vacation.  DLC doesnt have the same lead up time between when its content locked and when its released so if the DLC only takes a few months to create its entirely reasonable for it to be made ready between when the base game is finished and when the base game is launched.Obviously this can still be exploited by publishers and developers.  In THIS particular case the DLC content would never had made it into the game if not in DLC form but there are certainly other games where the DLC content was cut specifically to be put in DLC.,masseffect,cj1ek4y,3,t5_2rc19

1497282,0,t1_cj3xqrb,Using mass effect fields to change the position of the center of mass could work.  But it seems like a waste of energy plus the energy requirement adds to the waste heat.  Besides with the engines mounted on the wings below the fuselage the mass effect generators would have to create an area of high mass underneath the Normandy.  ... Hey maybe thats how the artificial gravity is done?  Then again we are debating scenarios and fictional well partially fictional at most technology.  Not that it isnt fun to do so. I have no problem with aesthetics being important in the game or even IRL for a flagship spec op frigate.  But it did seem like at the time just an obvious design oversight not to have the engines in line with the center of mass.  Or rather if the engine arent in line with the center of mass and positioned else where have the main engines net center of force be in line with the ships center of mass.  Simply sticking an engine on top and in the rear would be a quick fix.  I figured the central hole in Asari warships were for some sort of propulsion too.  At the very least it was an interesting and original looking design.  Yes their musical instruments would not be exactly like human ones.  But there are only so many ways to manipulate air to form sound waves so Id imagine there would be some similarities in design.  Humans having more fingers allows for more complexity and more simultaneous manipulation of moving parts or covering of air holes.  Maybe humans were more unique in their cycle when it can to music? Or at least when it came to number of fingers.  ,masseffect,cj3yj9x,2,t5_2rc19

1551459,0,t1_cjah1fm,Actually the role of a ships XO isnt to command but to free the Captain so he or she can make command decisions. The XO handles personnel issues  logistics and all the paperwork. The XO is in command in the Captains absence but realistically on a military ship the commander doesnt just leave the ship anytime he or she wants especially not to hop into a launch with two members of the crew to go storm a beach alone. But then Shepard wouldnt be much fun to play if all you got to do was sit in a chair and give orders.The point being that Miranda is well suited to be the XO because shes a stickler for the rules and is very good at organization and planning as well as gathering intelligence. Her problem is that shes been made second in command to a Captain who potentially wants her and her entire organization dead. As a bonus ten mercenaries are brought on board who have their own varying levels of hatred of Cerberus and if she tries to boss them around they just might put a bullet in her head. Jack and Tali especially. So the cards are stacked against Miranda from the start and I think it was intentional on Biowares part to make Miranda seem unlikable and have to work to dig deep to find out otherwise. The fic I linked shows preloyalty Miranda when shes still pretty much the ice queen. The game lets her thaw out a bit.

Examples in Mass Effect  Saren and TIMOf the two definitions one is real in both real world terms and have in game examples of them. By this concept if indoctrination has anything to do with how the ending plays out then its upon us to critically examine the ideas the Catalyst is giving us in order to have a chance to defeat the Reapers and has nothing to do with shepherds inner battle for his mind via a hallucinogenic trap.You might be chasing the wrong concept in order to get the best available answer.

1701015,0,t1_cjthurg,the problem with  in my opinion is how do they explore and discover?  The entirety of longrange travel of the species in the Milky Way is based on the relays.  It even says in the game multiple times that it would take years to just travel from one system to the next.  The only species that would be able to live long enough to get back to the far side of the galaxy would be the Asari. So we are talking about a large portion of the remaining life in the galaxy stuck in the Sol system.  Were do they get food enough to feed all these people?  The Reapers as far as anyone saw in game scorched the Earth.  The planet looked to have huge fires raging across the continents. Also where do they get materials to develop the next technology that allows them to expand outwards?  Im sure by this point that most of the Sol system has been mined heavily considering that its Humanities home system.Besides all that everything i have seen about ME has seemed to be pointing towards a story during Shepards life but not directly concerning Shepard.  My guess is we will see more exploring more discovery but from a younger Systems Alliance that has just been accepted into the greater Galactic community.  Were talking the years following the First Contact Wars or maybe even something dealing with that war.What ever it is I hope that Bioware gives the game the time it needs to be properly done.  Everyone on this thread has heard the story of MEs final being rushed and not being allowed to be edited.  Whether that was Casey Hudsons fault or pressure from EA I dont know but hopefully we will not see that in the coming games.,masseffect,cjtkq2l,3,t5_2rc19

Now i dont mean that in a sexy though she is girl next door she is that two way. I mean she lives a dream most of us want. She was able to go to school for years to learn about what she loved not worrying about money. Then she got to spend years on digs and trips doing what she loved only to learn that the one thing she is the best at is something that the fate of the galaxy depends on. And while out fighting and growing as a person she meets her soul mate sheppard. so she is living the dream most of us would like. She is also my second favorite archeologist between Daniel Jackson and Indy.But other than that both her and Tali are cute while still begin able to be sexy they are both brilliant and funny and they are both caring and have really nice voices. Also i may have a thing for blue alien chicks thanks starwars. Also i like them better than Ash who was a bitchy raciest and Miranda who while super hot was to much of an Ice cold bitch for me and i kept expecting her to stab me in the back for the illusive man.,masseffect,cjw2pab,0,t5_2rc19

My take on it is that its the cruiser plus the fighters that would give them problems  the cruiser alone would probably be no problem given the Thanix cannon but the fighters are a tougher target to hit and the Normandy is not a very large ship.  Combine that with a skeleton crew lack of repair facilities etc and I think what Joker is really saying is that it isnt worth the risk of major damage not that they couldnt do it if they really tried.,masseffect,cjye8dk,11,t5_2rc19

1845332,0,t1_ckbg1bv,I do agree with this as well that we are just either unable to find or understand life because we know so little about it in the grand scheme. But it is interesting to think how more advanced civilizations would communicate even in their respective base forms would it be lingual or pheromones or even something more advanced. Given the right planet one could assume that a race could develop an ability similar to the Protheans.It would make sense for a more advanced race not to want to interfere with us but as the article states why would they do this? But like you said it is likely we just cannot hear them. Then we reach the consensus that one of said Type II or above races would deviate from the supposed norm and interfere with us yet we still have no evidence besides a few fairly well documented cases at best Betty and Barney Hill but even then i remain skeptical as cases like that are easily disproved you can read into this if you want iirc she had drawn out a map of Zeti Reticuli after the abduction in a hypnotic session i guess i just hope we are not the only ones out here.But either way i agree with you we are simply not advanced enough to communicate to the universe well galaxy but i hope we do manage to advance before we drive ourselves to extinction.I tend towards thinking of not the most obvious but the way that different theories can slot to gether and support of disprove each other which is really interesting considering this is all thought these theories have no base other than extrapolation based on human experience over the years but they could all be accurate out in the vast expanse of our universe due to the sheer number of possibilities for life imo that can be explained because i like a challenge and it is always interesting to see how people can come up with a counter argument to your theory so you see the flaws But glad you enjoyed the article  Sorry for the wall of text ,masseffect,ckbk3yg,1,t5_2rc19

If you want to save everyone and not just Jack be sure to complete every loyalty mission of every charater before aquiring the Reaper IFF and then only do Legions Loyalty mission afterwards. You need all Upgrades for the Normandy first. The plans are aquired by talking to your Squad members aboard the Normandy. For the part where one of your squad members needs to hack through the vent you best pick someone who is loyal to you and a tech specialist such as Legion Kasumi or Tali.For the fire team you assign a loyal Miranda Garrus or Jacob. If you choose someone who isnt loyal and not Miranda Garrus or Jacob the vent specialist is going to die.If you made it in time and the Normandys crew is still alive you need to assign someone to escort them back to the Normandy. You should pick someone that is bad at defending such as Kasumi Tali Jack or Mordin and also loyal. They will be unavailable for the rest of the mission and will survive in the end. If you want to get Jack out of danger early and shes loyal assign her for the task.For the escort through the seeker swarms you need a strong biotic to maintain the shield. A loyal SamaraMorinth or Jack will get you through without anyone dying.Again you should assign either a loyal Garrus Jacob or Miranda to lead the fireteam though Miranda will survive even if she isnt loyal.For the final part you pick between Kasumi Tali Mordin or Jack as every other squad member is assigned to hold the line and needs a high defensive value to keep each other alive. As those listed above have bad defensive values you take them with you. Theyll die when the Collector Base falls apart if they arent loyal.,masseffect,ckffaxu,6,t5_2rc19

1973389,0,t1_ckqzs39,ampampamp Biological immortality sfw gtgtBiological immortality refers to a stable or decreasing rate of mortality from cellular senescence as a function of chronological age. Various unicellular and multicellular species may achieve this state either throughout their existence or after living long enough. A biologically immortal living being can still die from means other than senescence such as through injury or disease.gtThis definition of immortality has been challenged in the new Handbook of the Biology of Aging  because the increase in rate of mortality as a function of chronological age may be negligible at extremely old ages an idea referred to as the latelife mortality plateau The rate of mortality may cease to increase in old age but in most cases that rate is typically very high.  As a hypothetical example there is only a  chance of a human surviving another year at age  or greater.gtThe term is also used by biologists to describe cells that are not subject to the Hayflick limitgtInteresting Negligible senescence | Immortality | Hayflick limit | DNA damage theory of aging Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwckqzsb oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeleteckqzsb.

2074392,0,t3_2ijgs3,Not at all. If anything Mass Effect presents an engaging equalized and powerful representation of both genders. FemShep is recognized as both sexual intelligent powerful and deadly by multiple characters in each game and in romances as are many of the other female characters. Liara and Samara are also good examples because they both command respect but dont necessarily play the dominatrix role or hardass without a personality. No female character is just their to play a stereotype and all of them are treated quite well and on equal terms. Bioware is actually very good about this in Dragon Age as well a game that is set in more of a Medieval premise and thus would have more of an open chance to commentate about females in nontraditional roles. The interesting thing in DA is that while it is commented on in some cases Ser Aveline etc its never done as you might expect it to be and always backs up the point that were all on the same team here striving for the same goal. Mass Effet does that equally well if not better. Good luck on your dissertation   ,masseffect,cl3i15z,1,t5_2rc19

Bioware had ample opportunity to directly hint at some of the many possible dangers and flaws of Synthesis in the extended cut but they declined that opportunity and instead invested themselves in making Synthesis look as good as possible.As I said thats why I think the extended cut makes things worse in some respects.

You can convey mood even through dialogue and it always keeps the pace more exciting and interesting. I know this was a private moment and she was supposed to be quiet but I would place some dialogue between the team members while theyre on the shuttle instead of you telling us what each of them was doing. An overload of words filling that tiny vehicle and that to her are really more noise than anything else at the moment would emphasize how much Shep needed peace and quiet to reflect on what had happened and also give her a chance to notice Garrus was already catching on the vibe and was the only one not interested in the mission summary but rather on her. After all at this point he is the only one who was with both Shep and Kaidan before and who understands what just happened. She would get uncomfortable because of a concerned look of his noticeable silence and the obvious complicity between the two of them would only grow.But hey Im just making stuff up.

It strives to solve The Problem that the Leviathans tasked it with blinders on. Even when presented with the contradiction of them turning the Leviathans into Harbinger and their progenys involvement in the war it says I welcome their involvement. I am only facilitating their request.So it obviously just sees the last billion years as an experiment in an effort to solve The Problem.

2572176,0,t3_2p8daz,This is a copypaste of my comment from the unpopular Mass Effect opinions thread. I dont see Control get much defense soCONTROL.I argue that Control is the correct choice the only moral choice. Unmarked spoilers follow.Destroy is xenocide if the Geth exist at the end of the game. No way around it it is the intentional murder of an entire sentient race. It is also the murder of a close friend EDI. But destroy is worse than that. Between them the Leviathans and the Reapers and the Protheans offer ample evidence that destroy will merely delay the inevitable machineorganic war. There is no evidence that without the reapers anyone has ever succeeded at long term peace between synthetics and organics. It would be the height of hubris to think our cycle can. The only time through the trilogy I agreed with a Reaper was on Rannoch when Paragon Shepard tells the dying Reaper that this cycle is different. Different?  of synthetic races that arose during our cycle tried to exterminate their creators in selfdefense but even so. Make no mistake Destroy Shepards the next war is coming. And there wont be a Crucible to stop this one.EDIT I will also admit to considerable disgust at the number of players who seem to choose Destroy because of the postcredits scene that implies Shepard may survive. Because a happy ending can be built on the bones of an entire sentient species amirite?Synthesis is marginally less evil than destroy in that instead of destroying an entire race and condemning the galaxy to nighinevitable organicsynthetic war it merely changes the essential nature of every sentient being in the galaxy without their consent. Remember the reprogram option from Legions loyalty mission in ME? Synthesis. I cannot easily think of a perversion of free will more total than the green ending. And that stuff thats implanted? Reaper tech.Now Control. No races are exterminated. Nobody gets Reaper tech implanted without sayso. At that point I found it obviously better than the other two choices. No xenocide no cellularlevel nanomolestation. But it gets better. Paragon Shepard is about as close to a perfect peacekeeping force as one can get. If peace is possible the Paragon ShepardReapers can make it happen. But what happens if thats a lie? Or what if godlike power can corrupt the incorruptible Paragon Shepard? Well then the Crucible worked once. It can work again. If the Paragon ShepardReapers get out of hand crank that son of a gun up in Red Mode. I just dont see the downside to giving Control a try. We can always Destroy if it doesnt work out.,masseffect,cmublic,8,t5_2rc19

2625820,0,t1_cn13esk,The reason was a reaction to the Geth storming the Citadel. The Geth could fire off rounds far in excess of what the Council Alligned Races weaponry can which was one of the major reasons stated for the Citadels temporary defeat remember the TurainsAsariCouncil etc refused to believe that Reapers or Protheans or any other highlyadvanced race were involved so they blamed the Geths quicker development.Remember the Citadel Races havent had a major war since the Contact War or the Krogan Rebellions before that. Their entire armory was retrofitted to deal with the Geth threat. Now Mercenaries are a different story though theres implications that some mercs want moredakadaka Blood Pact? some like Blue Suns favour precise and tactical outmaneuvering and others want to keep up with them. Remember we see in ME that a single shot wont break shields while in ME we see a bigger focus on avoidance rather than enduring shootouts.The only real area where a nonthermal clip weapons are advantageous is where youre on the smaller side of asymmetrical warfare supplies are few and far between no chance of evacrescue a lot of firepower is needed but quantity is more important than time windows or power and maintenance is key. Now thats pretty rare for open warfare or merc work. Where it would actually have helped ironically is in the Reaper Resistance and those few folks who were on a controlled planet running from camp to camp taking potshots planting bombs etc. Thats why in ME we see the Lancer and the Prothean Particle Gun as really useful to the war effort. But thats another issue entirely and may have been engineered by certain indoctrinated folks.,masseffect,cn1bx90,5,t5_2rc19

2777126,0,t3_2rvulb,Take your time with the series. If you liked Dragon Age you can expect similar quality of storytelling and characters from Mass Effect. Combat varies from game to game unlike Dragon Age. ME is a mix of chaos and strategy. ME is coverbased and tactical. ME is a bit of a mix of the two.Theres more replay value in Mass Effect than Dragon Age. This is because Shepard is present in all three games so you are direct witness to the effects of your actions from game to game. Theres more incentive to go back to ME and play as someone different and do different things to see how it carries to ME. Play as both Shepards dont feel as if Shepard is your avatar but a character you are writing and directing. The game is more immersive if you feel confident that you are choosing actions true to your Shepard.Enjoy the ride while it lasts. Then get on it again. And again.

2778259,0,t1_cnjv0xi,Keep in mind that according to the entire galaxy A.I and machines are not real people. When they created the Geth as a work force it was just advanced mechs. The whole does this unit have a soul was not anticipated. Yes they did try to wipe them out but its still machines. I really doubt you would feel the same way about them unless you actually spoke to Legion or joined the consensus as we got to do in the game. Shepard got a very unique perspective of the Geth than no one else had as far as we know. To everyone else it was just intelligent machines that could wipe them out with ease. Also creating A.I was illegal so there is also that reason for wanting to eradicate their creation.Now I know that some Quarians stood up for the Geth when Quarians turned on them even without Shepards perspective.

In  most of the main story is required play however if you want continuity from the first game keep the rachni queen alive in  and play the outpost mission on tuchanka in  Grunts appearance plus the rachni story arch Its really a matter of what you deem important.

Council finds the meanest junkyard dogs they can find i.e. krogan. Krogan are well adapted to bug squishing due to their supreme idiocy  they literally cannot tell the difference between air and poison and were therefore able to invade toxic planets that would have been prohibitively expensive for Asari or Salarians to clear due to hazard pay and worker safety regulations.Then the krogan turn to the stars and start being what can only be described in technical terms as salty. So the Council asks the newly discovered Turian Hierarchy which was only named as such because the turians thought calling their civilization The Hottest Shit Since Fucking Sliced Bread was a little on the nose to kindly tell the krogan to quote fuck off end quote. The krogan did not listen which is unsurprising given that Im not entirely sure they have ears.Cue the turians enacting their patented Battle Plan Alpha a twopronged approach to warfare consisting of a kicking ass and b taking names. That meteor strike thing you mentioned? Yeah how badass were the turians if the only way the krogan could get an advantage was to literally knock the planet out from under them?You say the turians were losing to the Reapers but what you call losing is what my boys in the turian fleet like to call luring the enemy into a false sense of security. Also the Reapers didnt even bother invading Tuchanka with anything more than one measly destroyer since they obviously needed everything in their arsenal just to hold the Primarch off from personally kicking Harbingers ass back to Squidville.Now Wrex is a total bro and all but he aint nuthin to my boy Gmoney.,masseffect,cnnafjb,13,t5_2rc19

Copper for example transfers heat extremely quickly and therefore is an excellent heat sink because it absorbs heat quickly from surrounding metal and expels it to the cooler air around it. Replace the air with whatever the clip is made of and youve got a good heat sink.Also we went from the Wright Brothers flight in  to walking on the moon in  in over twice that time frame I think we can make some pretty good advancements in weapons technology especially after finding the Mars Archives.I disagree with your scenario I think they just didnt want to keep the infinite ammo mechanic maybe test group who knows so they went to ammo.,masseffect,cnvm6sv,3,t5_2rc19

2919060,0,t3_2tjb0f,I think a fundamental aspect of what makes the other species in Mass Effect so interesting and alien is the fact that you are observing and interacting with them through the eyes of a human. Think about it Shepards actions are a reflection of what it means to be human she is strong willed she never gives up and she sticks to her gut feelings. Many of the alien characters in the games often remark upon this. Now look at the Asari. The fundamental fact that the Asari is monogendered completely changes their perception on the galaxy around them not including the fact that they can live for up to a thousand years or the unique way that they reproduce with other species.

2947326,0,t3_2twspy,There were most definitely millions of innocent people killed by the geth. The games never actually tell us why or how though. Its all speculation. This whole thread is just speculation. My take on it is that the geth all had a general consensus The quarian species is a threat to our survival and so after initially trying to be peaceful they sought out to annihilate any and all members of the race. Being the still very young race that they were they didnt know any better.On the wiki it states that billions of quarians died in the morning war. Meaning that the minimum number of quarians alive when the war started was  billion. only  million remained when the war was finished. Which means that less than . of their species was still intact. Theres absolutely no possible way that innocent people werent slaughtered in the hundreds of millions.Also keep in mind that the war lasted for less than a year. So the idea that the quarians killed billions of themselves is also pretty bogus. thousands or even hundreds of thousands sure. But millions or billions?  no way. You dont genocide your entire species in a single year because of an unwinnable war against another foe. Nobody is that dimwitted.The number of noncombatant children and infants alone had to be at least  of the race. Most likely much higher. So at least two hundred million children died. Theres no reason for that except for overzealous slaughter.I love Legion hes really interesting and a very well done character. Especially in Mass Effect .

James oh James I honestly rank James as one of my favorite characters.

Even Diana I thought that was a cool idea to put a reporter on board she made the Normandy seem less crass and more like a home.

3009538,0,t3_2unajd,NG is really easy on Insanity NG not so much as you mentioned. The hardest bit of the game is usually the fight with the Krogan Battlemaster when you rescue Liara  if you bring Kaiden its a little easier as you can stop him from healing.The Mako is annoying to use on Insanity too mainly because it doesnt do any more damage so it takes an age to kill anyone. I usually get out and kill everything on foot if I need XP so its less of a problem then although trying to do that with Thresher Maws can be difficult.ME is easier in some ways and harder in others. The weapons are a lot more fun to use in ME and its usually quicker to kill enemies. Just watch out for the Praetorian fights you have to keep moving or itll pin you behind cover and kill you really easily. Heavy weapons can be a real help in those fights. I personally use the Cain because itll either one shot a boss or take them so low down that killing them is really easy. Its especially useful at the end of Legions loyalty mission because you can just fire it around the corner and clear all the enemies out.Id recommend modding the game to allow you to use biotics and tech powers on enemies with shields or barriers otherwise you spend most of your time just shooting enemies rather than using any powers. It does make the game easier but it makes it a lot more fun to play too. ME handled this a lot better with less enemies with shields and more varied powers including biotic and tech combos. In ME on Insanity nearly every enemy will have some form of shield or barrier which really slows the combat down.,masseffect,co9xq13,3,t5_2rc19

3040540,0,t3_2uvu78,A tip for Grunts recruiting mission if you kill Jedore the other Krogan pods will stop opening. So if you have some heavy weapon ammo or a sniper rifle kill her quickly and you will only have to deal with  Krogan. Also earlier in the mission with the infinite spawn of Krogan coming at you across the bridge you can run behind them and as soon as you trigger the radio dialogue pretty sure its Jedore the spawn cuts off. Garrus is a pain in the ass though. However for his loyalty mission with the two mechs you can just turn around and climb higher onto one of those platforms and they can barely hit you. Makes it pretty easy. The squad members I take on insanity varies widely with what class Im playing and what I expect to find but in general I take Grunt everywhere with a nonsoldier. At high levels he is just a perfect tank and gives something for everyone to shoot at while you cut through them. Also with his Claymore and incendiary he does good damage. I also like to take Miranda as she has powers that affect both shieldssynthetics and barrierarmorhealth AND she increase your squad weapon damage and health. Another  of damage per shot from the Widow is quite a bit. Samara is great after her loyalty mission. Legion with the Widow is fun.,masseffect,cod5flk,1,t5_2rc19

3135703,0,t1_con07k0,Dude that is insane. I dont think Ive ever had a Shepard with that intense headcanon. I usually headcanon the specifics of the origin story then derive a simple Modus Operandi from that. For example this Shep Im playing at the moment is a Colony kid. The massive amounts of death she encountered at a young age led to her being very apathetic toward the deaths of anybody. Like when Ash talks about how shes cut up about her squad dying Shep just tells her that its war. People die. She is mentally incapable of understanding how people care so much when someone dies. But this doesnt mean that she doesnt care about people. Its like theyre a great person and I love them but now that theyre dead theyre gone. Grieving does nothing. She remembers them but isnt sad that theyre gone.This combination leads to an outlook based around an Al Capone quote Im a kind person. Im kind to everyone. But if you are unkind to me then kindness is not what you will remember me for. So she enjoys the people who are kind to her but if someone is a dick then she will make their life hell and if necessary kill them and not think about it ever again.She also hates Batarians and enjoys killing them because of the War HeroColonist background. But thats a pretty stockstandard headcanon.,masseffect,con0ggc,1,t5_2rc19

In order to not miss anything like that make sure to talk to your teammates regularly between major missions.Otherwise generally there are two paths which you probably know  the paragon and renegade paths.  Good decisions get you paragon points whereas more fiery perhaps impulsive decisions get you renegade points.  You can mix and match but if you do realize that later in the game you might not have enough of either one to make the big decisions.  Thats not the end of the world but if you want to consider going close to full renegade or paragon.  Generally the top option on the wheel is paragon the bottom is renegade.If no one else told you you can switch classes from game to game.Lastly just be aware that more than any other series Ive played choices from one game can make a BIG difference in the subsequent games.  If you get pissed off at someone in a moment and make a shortsighted decision you may pay for it later.  Not to say dont do it but your choices do matter.,masseffect,corgjgd,1,t5_2rc19

3280099,0,t1_cp24itc,Im not sure the other characters are built up to be perfect. I mean besides Miranda but the whole point of her arc is that she isnt perfect despite being designed that way.Garrus is obsessed shortsighted and eager to end someones life because of his limited view of justice and impatience.Tali is loyal to her people to a fault to the point where she cant speak out against the admiralty because shes worried about her position in the fleet.Wrex is blindly fights to fix  people who dont want to be fixed.Grunt is psychotic. So is Jack. And Zaeed.Liaras entire existence revolves around her relationship with Shepard.Basically all the fan favorites have issues and flaws but none of them really deal with them. Except Mordin. Hes dealt with his mistakes shortcomings and failures pretty much on his own. Same with Samara.Its just that the very vocal fans embrace the flaws of their beloved characters and praise them for it. Garrus plays vigilante and wouldnt hesitate to murder a criminal Grunt is like your psycho baby who is lighting corpses on fire one minute and getting drunk on the Presidium the next and Liara is your waifu who will make blue babies with you whether you want her to or not.Its a shame how the fandom treats characters like Jacob or Ashley or James or sometimes Kaiden because these human characters have flaws but they arent looking for someone to save them. They deal with their own shit and if you try to pry into something they dont want to talk about they push you away.Something about the human characters definitely feel more real to me as opposed to the pedestal of awesome for Garrus Grunt Tali etc. As much as I love all the characters some have more fan appeal and some have more grounded realism.,masseffect,cp25oz4,3,t5_2rc19

Most players will have their loyal crew surviving in ME if not everyone so there is nothing like that in ME. In ME you could maybe argue that the Virmire sacrifice is a thing but its more about making hard choices and less about letting go. You cant really call it a central theme if it appears only one time in the trilogy and even then not totally obvious.Hope is a way more present theme things get destroyed we build them up again.

I know conventional weapons couldnt take one down but maybe there could have been a hull breach in the Reaper that we had to shoot at.

3454227,0,t1_cplywlj,I had the exact opposite experience with biotic Shep. Most enemies on lower difficulty dont have shielding or armor so they get tossed around with ridiculous ease if youre a Vanguard or an Adept and both those classes have access to antiarmor with the Adept being able to detonate biotic shielding. Bring along someone with Overload or grab the Locust and you can take on any enemy pretty easily and still have a slot to fill with any character you want. Sentinels just tear away any protection the enemy has with ease.On higher difficulties warp is frequently necessary especially against the Collectors the Sentinels abilities make most combat much easier shockwave can still slow down and hurt armored husk waves and the Vanguard still murders everything.Biotics might not be godtier in ME but theyre still awesome. Especially if your companions can whittle down armor and shielding while you use pull to lift baddies out of cover. This worked really well for me with a Vanguard and having Garrus and Thane by my side most of the time.

3480645,0,t3_303ivd,People hated the original endings for a LOT of reasons. I think we can all agree on these complaints The Mass Relays blow up in every ending so no matter what ending you choose its implied that every fleet over Earth is screwed and the entire intergalactic network is fucked. The EC remedies this by either showing the Relays get fixed or implying that the Relays will be fixed. In the low EMS Destroy ending however the Relays do not get fixed. Your squadmates and Joker just abandon you at the Crucible. A lot of people were upset about how Joker just left you for dead after Harbinger attacks you. The EC fixes this by showing your squadmates get nearly killed by vehicle wreckage and Joker sweeps in to evacuate your squadmates. Then when you make your final decision Joker tries to fly back to the Crucible. However he reluctantly has to turn around. Speaking of Joker another complaint about him is that in the final scene the Normandy winds up on a jungle planet and just sits there. Joker with or without EDI walks out sees the world around him and thats it. The EC fixes this by showing the Normandy get repaired and fly away from the jungle planet. I cant believe this wasnt in the original ending. In the original it made it seem like Joker was the only survivor and that he couldnt get off of the planet. Not enough explanation of your choices. Destroy Control and Synthesis were presented to you but regardless of your choice you just saw a colored explosion and thats it. The EC simply added more cutscenes and added a narrated slideshow to help explain the consequences of your actions.,masseffect,cpp0of2,4,t5_2rc19

3603702,0,t1_cq2inco,If we go by canon numbers Mass Effect loses simply because it tries to be semirealistic heat management physics aside from Eezo.  I love Mass Effect as a game and universe but in a scifi tech battle theyre toast.  Every other faction has... Heavier weapons Mass Effect is generally limited to kilotons. Better shields Mass Effects shields dont block energy attacks everyone elses do. Superior fasterthanlight Reapers manage k times c but the rest are stuck well below that with heat buildup issues if not using relays. Possibly more people the Council affects trillionsthe SW galaxy alone has  quadrillion beings. Sensors that work faster than light MEs dedication to semirealism gets in the way again.That said Mass Effect has a few unique items... Element Zero may offer weapons that could defeat shields not intended to protect against rapid gravitational fluctuations. Biotics may have advantages in combat similar to but in my opinion less than Jedithe Force. Politics could come into play meaning that the weaker factions might end up under the protection of someone stronger ParaShep  Negotiation  Instant Win. The geth may be able to disable reappropriate or influence technology from other factions. Prothean tech largely unexploredability to reverseengineer may bode well for stealing things from the others.Excepting the possibility of Reaper indoctrination or other forces gaining access to technologies lacking in that universeThis leaves again my personal opinions the Ultimate Showdown of Ultimate Destiny...IN SPACE or not for the rest.Star Wars dominates space.  Period.  Gigaton multigigaton etc. weapons simply tear through anything even Borg.  Sure cubes laugh off megatonscale weaponry torpedoes which I assume are more powerful than phasersdisruptors of the Federation Klingons etc. but I dont think a maximum efficiency group would overbuild to resist weapons orders of magnitude greater at least not initially.  Speaking of the Federation they build explorers not warshipseven though theyre armed they are not militarized.Halo ships may compete with Star Wars if many weapons are in the gigaton range e.g. Super MAC though Halo on Wikia gives shipboard MACs as little better than Mass Effect  kilotons.  Covenant and Forerunner weapons could even the score thoughI have no idea on their yield.  Given that Covenant ships glass read Star Wars Base Delta Zero I suspect they would be highly competitive in the destruction department but not in the defense department since a Super Mac low gigaton yieldsame source gives it  gigatons can punch a hole clean through a Covenant Capital Ship and pass through that ship destroy a second one and cripple a third.  Not sure what size of ship is being referenced but capital implies something of significance.Halos assets include... Advanced AI who can forget Cortana or Guilty Spark?. Extreme militarization has pushed technological development in ways that the peaceful Federation and nomoreCerberus Systems Alliance wouldnt dare touch. Flood not so much an asset as a huge wild card that could be dangerous in combat against all other factions. Unknown extent of Forerunner tech for all I know it might have multiple I WIN buttons buried in it.Star Treks weaknesses have already been brought up.  But like Mass Effect their ability to steal technology and a few specialized items no one else possesses may give them an advantage aside from those they already hold which are... Transporters.  Every Trek side of the STvsSW argument invokes these never mind they tend to not work with shields up transporters not working for whatever reason is usually a common plot point in Star Trek.  Still the ability to arbitrarily insert or remove things from distance see Vidiian organ beaming is HUGE and cannot be overstated in the cases where it is viable. Replicators.  Energytomatter conversion make provisioning a breeze.  It also might depending on various scifi technobabbles make duplicating captured technology very easy. Mastery of the manyspace e.g. subspace slipstream etc.  Star Trek ships might be able to access dimensions and aspects of the universe that others cannot see or follow them into. FTL firing.  I believe Star Trek ships have used weapons while at warp something that no other faction has done that Im aware of.  Further a phaser always hits its target unless that target is out of range.  The same cannot be said for pulsebased Star Wars weapons.Depending on where the fight takes place factions could have specific advantages or disadvantages.  For example without mass relays the Mass Effect faction is totally screwed.  Strange stellar phenomena in the Star Trek galaxy they can deal with after a shows worth of fuss of course might make life difficult for everyone else.  The various superpowered Force wielders in the Star Wars galaxy could also make life difficult for those unable to handle them as could the Q Continuumif they bother to interfere that is.  Note I consider the Q to be so powerful theyre basically authorweight so it raises question of both fairness and Really seriouslythis bit again? from a storytelling perspective.  Halo doesnt really talk about negative space wedgies much in the areas I have knowledge of read not much but the Arrays exist.  Mass Effects pseudorealism also rules out any sort of stuff thats the Problem of the Week on Star Trek shows.  If someone activates the Halo Arrays well everyones gonna die.Finally outcomes depend on which version of each faction we use.  Do we use the latest in their canon timeline postHalo farahead Legacy Era rebootfar more military Star Trek postReaperWar Mass Effect?  Or do we use some other timeframe?  Granted picking and choosing timeframes makes it easy to change the power of each faction.  So which is used matters.,masseffect,cq31qar,3,t5_2rc19

3775914,0,t3_33m8f0,theres two version of MEs Insanity. NG is the easiest Insanity level in the trilogy ME does come near but ME fights are more fun for me I felt that the difficulty was nerfed because you have most of the upgrades and all. But insanity on vanilla NG was brutal because youre leveling and youre still upgrading your weapon and mod collection so most of your weapons doesnt make much dent on your enemies. But your squadmates are more reliable and badass on insanity than the first two games. In ME nobody develop instant shield armor or barriers like ME so theyre still vulnerable but enemies AI are a bit smarter and do more damage on you especially bosses. Grenades tend to kill you so you have to move a lot from cover. You learn to be more effective with using powers and weapon combination. If you remember those bar thingy in ME in squad menu try to remember that every time you choose your squad. You can have an easier playthrough with balanced squad. Cerberus are vulnerable with tech. Reapers are vulnerable to biotics but techfirecryo explosion can sometimes do the trick. And I dont care about the haters but Kaidan is the most useful and versatile squadmate in ME and most reliable on Insanity. As vanguardinfiltratoradept I bring him along all the time.  besides you only have three squadmate with biotic abilities and one of them is a DLC and Liara is glass canon. Reave could prime and detonate a biotic explosion. Overload is more effective than energy drain and it can prime for fire burst with carnage and detonate frozen enemies with his cryo blast or cryo ammo. Hes dead useful to have when fighting against barriershielded enemies. Unlike EDI and Garrus hes more effective against barrierarmored reapers and atlas and can handle himself alone. Garruss concussive shot and grenades really arent that powerful and his armorpiercing ammo doesnt really do a lot of damage since he took his time taking his shots and not quick enough for me especially if youre already an Infiltrator youll feel like youre the better sniper than he is. EDIs incineration are useful for fire bursts but shes still vulnerable even with decoy and defense matrix. On armax arena as sentinels he and Miranda simply kills everything and rarely die in boss swarms even close combat. Bring them along for Spectre and Unsual Score and they can handle themselves well while you keep yourself alive and take down enemies one by one.,masseffect,cqmokdd,2,t5_2rc19

4140414,0,t3_382fsz, Big crew provided lots of unique options for combat your choices were not just expys of the six character classes.   Storywise it was a bit of a mess  each personal story worked well individually but all mashed together in one game it made them hard to focus on it was almost like an anime serial with each character getting one minute episode.  But still very well written probably the best game of the three in terms of writing. The suicide mission was a great idea got incredibly lucky on my first playthrough for being a completionist and having all upgradesloyalties before the IFF mission but in retrospect its something that would have worked better at the end of the series.  Perhaps even a flip of the mechanics  in  theres a smaller and more focused team and in  theres a larger team and the possibility of more Bteam actions where characters can die if you dont send the right ones. Best companions Combat  Garrus.  Tough and versatile.  One of two characters Miranda being the other with the ability to damage shields barriers andor armor depending on how you spec him.  A great pick for any class. Story Arc  Mordin.  One of the most alien aliens in the series.  A fasttalking quick thinking deadly practical utilitarian who turns out to be deeply conflicted about the ethics and morality of an ongoing genocide.  Also he has the funniest cant talk lines in the game  and so many of them.  Still dont wanna know who brought the varren... Romance  Liara.  Lair of the Shadow Broker is great DLC as is.

Ive only come across a handful of times the event of choosing a paragon or renegade answeraction and having them mix renegade and paragon traits respectfully in them just like it happens in real life. In reality you can rarely give strictly good or badass answers the way Mass Effect expresses them without coming across like a complete weirdo because thats how life and expression works. It can especially get a bit clouded when we deal with video games when you cant really expect a mixedtoned down renegade answer when you choose the red sentence because games cant fully include the complexity of life and its communication aspects. The player sees red and immediately relates to the simple meaning behind the color. No complexity.That being said I do think some renegade or even paragon options could tone down the teenage angst a bit.

Another character replacement like with Grunt and Wrex and Thane and Mordin and Tali? Or are you saying all you wouldve needed for keeping track of your choices is a few quick lines like with Conrad?

Infiltrator Which I assume you mean by Sniper is nice for this since they have tech stuff plus access to really strong guns cloaking and slow down time a little while aiming the sniper rifle.

But I think it was in mass effect two when they fought the reaper swarms I think on the derelict reaper they pointed out the fact that the husks werent human but prothean and they looked like the statues on ilos. Also the statues were supposed to be prothean or where at least thought to be until Jarvik pointed out that ilos was a inusannon planet before it was prothean.  It made sense swing that the collectors only had one percent of similar Dna.

How scary would that be for him and Kolyat? Theyre on weird planet where they know virtually no one Thane has a disease that presumably most Earth doctors would have little idea how to treat and hes a relatively unusual alien.How horrible would that be for Kolyat to try to get him help?

It would be the nice thing to do but that would introduce far too many variables in the level of starting technology surely.  The people in the trailer didnt have all glowy eyes from the Synthesis ending.Lastly on a personal note. Its going to be really really difficult to play this game without Garrus.

4364891,0,t1_cshn0rw,Ok.  Ive seen a lot of people confused by this.  Basically you can do AT MOST two missions while awaiting installation of the IFF.  The game goes by the core missions you have remaining not assignments.  If you have one loyalty mission remaining then you activate Legion and talk to him before touching the galaxy map the game will give you two missions before the IFF is ready.  But it will not give you any more than two.If you have no missions left or you have one and forget to activate legion before going to the galaxy map you can only do one mission.If you have no missions AND you dont activate Legion activating the galaxy map should cause the IFF to be installed instantly if Im not mistaken.  Either that or you just have to go visit a hub world or do a sidequest.What a lot of people do is exploit the fact that you can have two missions in order to bring Legion along on Talis loyalty mission which changes the dialogue considerably.,masseffect,cshnp8x,2,t5_2rc19

4631904,0,t1_cteeeg9,That seems as foreign a concept to me as my inability to get into ME is to ME fans hahaHrmm. Let me see. Well off the bat combat is different. ME is a shooter which is faster paced and exciting. If combat is your biggest hangup Im not sure what to tell you... But if thats not the issue I will say they provide you a LOT of choices in a way that very very few other RPGs do. The main aspect of KOTOR and DAO is the freedom you have in quests both main quests and side quests. In fact that agency that choice stems further than just quests. There will be occasional moments that arent technically part of a quest but still give you plenty of dialogue prompts.So lets use KOTOR as an example. Theres a side quest where a woman informs you her husband was a hunter. She wants to sell a trophy an animal skull that her husband acquired in order to get her and her kids to a better world.  Problem is you can only enter the hunting lounge and sell it if you have a hunting license and she doesnt.  From there you have a number of options. You can decline you can say youll try and see what you can do and you could even persuade her to give you the skull and youll sell it for her. Shes of course skeptical but you can basically tell her what other choice do you have? If you wanna be a jerk or you can be more reassuring.Part of the main quest involves getting the hunting license to progress but you can then go in and sell the skull. Youll get something like  credits for it. You can return to her and have a number of options Basically tell her to go screw herself and keep the money You can lie to her and say you only got  for it and keep the other half You can give her the full  OR you can lie and tell her you got  for it and give her an extra .Those options result in more or less light side or dark side points depending on how nice or how bad you are. Every quest is like that. The true allure of those games isnt combat its the choices. Id argue that story isnt even as important as the choices. All it needs is a decent story and great characters and it comes together beautifully.Another KOTOR example of a nonquest moment is any of the landing pads when you first arrive on a planet. Most typically have a landing fee of some kind and you can play along and pay up persuade them for a lower feel Force Persuade them and inform them that you dont need to pay the fee try and threaten them etc. Its entirely up to you.DAO is much the same way albeit instead of Star Wars its a classic fantasy world with its own unique lore.One of my biggest recommendations and the way I always play is to invest heavily in the skills and attributes that will help you in Persuasion. Because like I said the combat isnt the focus. Thats just a means to an end IMO. Conversations is where its at which sounds boring but if you like the deep conversations of ME theyre even deeper in these games! The only difference is your character doesnt have a voice. I think the tradeoff is absolutely worth it. That doesnt mean you should forsake combat skills and feats  some battles are difficult if youre not prepared.Im really not exaggerating when I say that  of quests give you a mostly neutral option a good option a very good option a meanevil option and a pure evil option.One last example from DAO not sure if you made it to Lothering in your playthrough but outside the settlement are a group of highwaymen trying to get you to pay  silver or whatever to pass. Basically here are your options. Also note there are some options I wont list as those typically are questions or something that give you more backgroundHey we need money to help pay for the reconstruction of this bridge.  silver please. Fight and kill them pay the toll Oh so youre with the reconstruction crew?If you pick that last option Ummm yes. Yes we are. Sad times but we need all the money we can get to get these repairs done! I dont think so. Very well here you go. If youre rebuilding the road why not ask for more?If you pick thay last option again You...want to pay more? Well well happily accept donations! Not gonna happen! Here you go. Persuade No... but theres a caravan behind me. Lots of gold.If you pick that last one Wouldnt a caravan like that have a lot of security? It wants to appear poor apparently. I killed the security.Either way he allows you to continue on. You can theoretically leave it at that but if you speak to them again..You know Im starting to think you were lying about that caravan. Ugh it was just a trick. Now you have to pay us  silver! Fight them Pay the new toll Intimidate Do you really want to mess with a Greg Warden? Intimidate Do you really want to mess with a mage? If youre a mage your race and class also add new dialogue options depending on the situationIf you pick the first intimidation option Hmmm...didnt they do ? Okay fine. Well forget the toll! Move along. Actually. Im just gonna kill you. Thank you. Persuade You know...the Grey Wardens could use donations.If you pick that last one You dont say...sigh. Okay heres  silver its all we got today. Not good enough! Thank you. You know what I changed my mind. Ill just kill you.Lets say you graciously accept their donation and speak to them again... You again? I thought we solved things rather well no? Ive decided Im just going to kill yoy. Intimidate You need to leave now.This is why I suggest heavily investing in what helps you get more persuasion andor intimidation options because it unlocks a lot more options and  ease the game already has a lot of options this extends the number even higher. With persuasion and intimidation youre able to go from highwaymen trying to get you to pay  silver to getting them to pay you double the original price. At nearly every step of the way you have the option of saying fuck it and killing them if you so desire but if youre like me youll revel in twisting people around your finger either as poetic justice or for righteous reasons or for personal gain if youre going evil. And the great thing is that I have a blast being both good and evil on different playthroughs. Threatening civilians and then killing them even after theyve complied is hilariously evil but its fun to just be the worst person ever. But its equally as enjoyable being a complete saint and refusing rewards paying money for others etc.And the neat thing is that KOTOR is all about light and dark side points. Your alignment will affect rhe outcome of the game providing you with one of two endings that may be slightly different based on other things. But DAO isnt about some ethereal good and evil karma system but more about how your companions perceive you those who share similar views will approve and those who dont will disapprove. This affects your relationship with them.KOTOR  utilizes both the light and dark meter AND influence system. Not made by Bioware but plays pretty much the same. AND that one also deals with fray areas as well. Choosing light side options are not always the best thing. Its interesting even if you dont subscribe to the viewpoint.TLDRInvest in Persuasion skills and things that help that. The main draw is the dialogue and decisions you make so having those open the games up even more. If you thought my examples were long... yeah. I wanted to show you how many options you have throughout the quests and stuff.I played KOTOR when I was in elementary school. My brother didnt think Id enjoy it because the combat wasnt flashy and it was more about conversations and morality. He was wrong. I ate thay shit up and loved the choices you can make.,masseffect,ctef69b,2,t5_2rc19

Perfect recollection in their memories have a weird symbiotic relationship with the hanar to the point that theyre often used as assassins and the like for them. gtWhich of these races do you think feels the most alien?In the ME universe Id say the humans are most alien. Very new to the rest of the species and yet so ambitious and headstrong. In less than  years the entire race went from discovering the other galactic races to having a seat on the council and a member of their race as a SPECTRE. I also think that in the universe of Mass Effect humanity is painted as a more diverse race. With a few exceptions the Asari all seem to be elegant and smart even down to battle strategy. The Turians are all organized and military oriented. Krogans are all battleborn and stubborn. Salarians are cold calculating strategists. Quarians are crafty and smart and often think on their feet and adapt to new situations quickly. We havent seen enough of the Drell or Volus IMO to form opinions on so they could be exceptions. And then there are the humans. Some of them like James and Ashley are soldiers through and through like the Krogan and Turian races. Some are more like Salarians and are better with facts and data like specialist Traynor. I think that Samara in ME summed it up best You are more individualistic than any other species Ive encountered. Put three humans in a room there will be six opinions.gtIf you could take one of these races FROM Mass effect to another game which race would you take and to what game?Id like to see Drell in any sort of stealth game.

Im wondering whether its worth playing through ME or whether these things have been improved.First theres the levelling system.  I would much rather put in incremental points rather than waiting for two levels to increase one skill.  It seems very restrictive.Second theres the combat which I am finding reminds me a lot of Duck Hunt. Its very FPS which Im not really enjoying.  That said I really like sniper rifles a lot.  Edit Also why make ammo scarce??  Why???Third there is very little variation in weapons and armour.  I liked ME weapons because you got to instal upgrades and you found all sorts of caches of upgrades and items  loot!  Now its just money and metal.  BORing.Nevertheless Im really enjoying it.

4859061,0,t3_3hg1dr,Most people myself included recommend starting the DLC at the point of no return. The game will make it very clear when that is. This is because a characters involvement in the DLC is dependent on whether that characters story arc for ME has been completed. For Tali for example it would be at the end of the Rannoch arc. When you reach the point of no return every character who can partake in DLC content will be available. Im not sure if you want to know more about the plot part so read this paragraph with caution just in case. Going to Andersons apartment triggers the plot part and you wont be able to leave the citadel specifically the DLC related parts of the citadel until you finish the plot part. As for the content its a very fun and very diverse set of missions that features great combat as well as a refreshing break from combat. Ill say no more. After the plot part comes a party which you can invite whoever you want to and which you can throw whenever you want.Also since all of the DLC meetups happen inside either the apartment or Silversun Strip which which arent accessible without playing the DLC it sounds like you may have skipped some of the base game Citadel meetups which would be unfortunate.,masseffect,cu70rk3,24,t5_2rc19

That mission was awesome battling your way through a lab on a mountainside on a timer.Nevertheless I still have to say that the ME Suicide Mission is by far the best of the series. That mission should be an example of how you conclude an RPG and probably contributed to why people felt the ME ending was dissapointing. ,masseffect,cukzigw,1,t5_2rc19

4981534,0,t3_3j35e4,I wouldnt be surprised if most people who strongly dislike the Mako are playing on consoles.  The control scheme is generally more familiar to PC users who have been using WASD to turnmove and mouse to look independently since the nineties e.g. Mech Warrior  could be configured this way although I dont think it was the default.  Movement was fairly intuitive for me but I found the jets without hacks to be a tad pointless.  The Mako was resilient enough that you rarely needed to use jets to cushion landings.  Using them when driving up a steep incline was almost always a bad idea.  With hacks the jets can be a lot of fun however.  A Harrier Mako with jump jets is actually kind of awesome.Where the control scheme broke down a bit on the PC was the gunsights.  Three discrete levels of zoom with no way to zoom out without going aaaaalll the way back to nozoom was very annoying.  I wonder if theres some way to hack the game to create a zoom out key.  What would have been even better would have been continuous zoom perhaps using the mousewheel.  This would have solved the Closer... Closer...  Too close! nature of the Makos optics.  Another reason why many people probably dont care for the Mako that much is that it generally wasnt much of a challenge.  It was exceedingly rare for enemies with small arms to get close enough to hit the Mako not that theyd do much damage and the big guns all fired very slow moving particles aimed universally by all enemies at your current location.  It was trivial to avoid all fire by simply staying far enough away to have time to react to incoming fire and then moving in between cannon shots.  A bigger variety of threats and AI strategies would have really made combat in the Mako more fun.  Thresher Maws were the rare exception in that they had a random chance of coming up directly under you and flipping the Mako which was bloody annoying.  A little warning if they were about to come up directly under you would have made them a little less cheap.  Some of the main missions had very fun Mako sections however.  For example Noveria was pretty fun if you abandoned the hang back and snipe everything with the cannon strategy and just bulldozed your way through Geth positions without worrying too much about picking off all the survivors.  Cannon sniping was in general too easy and hence boring.  Feros also had a pretty good Mako section.,masseffect,cumgjoj,1,t5_2rc19

5124048,0,t1_cv3jkbj,How is that strange? With their own platform they get all the money from the purchase instead of Valve taking a cut of the sale. Its reasonable that the company that produced the games would not want a rd party taking a cut from the sale simply by selling it.But besides that having several store platforms competing is only a good thing. Origin launched with a refund policy and later introduced the play a game for free for a limited time and even game on the house where you literally get a game for free which Steam didnt have at the time or doesnt have. Only recently did Steam implement their own refund policy part of the reason is no doubt that Origin and GOG had refund policies first and Steam needs to compete. We are also seeing that Steam wants to get better at support which they are terrible at right now again Origin and GOG has better support anecdotal evidence so take it with a grain of salt so Steam has to compete. Sure its a bit of a hassle for the user to have several store clients for different games but if it means that Steam gets a refund policy it is worth it. ,masseffect,cv3n1o5,3,t5_2rc19

5189070,0,t3_3m250y,Oh wow. It amazes me how someone can misinterpret characters so horribly. Basically everything you are saying borders on straight up trolling and I dont know whats wrong with me for taking the bait. Whatever. Here we go again.gtKaidan is such a whiny douchebag and a major hypocrite. On the one hand he cries about morality and yet hes a murderer killed his tutor in a fit of biotic rage. And if you play with a femshep you cant be even moderately nice to him or he thinks youre in a relationship.Nope. That tutor has been abusing him and the other BAaT for a considerable amount of time. Physical mental emotional. Kaidans friend reached for a glass of water instead of using her biotics to pull it in and that tutor decided to teach her not to use her arm by breaking it. Kaidan as any abused teenager would lashed out in a fit of uncontrolled emotion and accidentally killed the man.So yeah he killed someone. But he confesses that he has felt nothing but guilt and shame over it for years. He was never punished. The Alliance just swept it all under the rug and shut BAaT down. Hes had to live with that. So no. Hardly hypocritical of him at all to believe in morality to believe that you have to be responsible for your actions. It shows his depth as a character.If you want to talk about murder and hypocritical values lets look at Garrus. When you meet him at Dr. Michels clinic he shoots her captor literally inches from her face. Impressive right? So you praise him for it. That was a hell of a shot.And his response? Sometimes you get lucky.Wait. What the fuck? Lucky? So he didnt actually care about her life. He was completely willing to shoot her through the head to kill Fists thugs.And remember his story about Dr. Saleon? Salarian surgeon with a thing about growing black market organs? He tells you on the Normandy that he is willing to shoot down a ship full of hostages over the Citadel. That wouldnt just kill hostages and Dr. Saleon. That would kill everyone in the Wards below the ship as debris would rain down on them crushing them into itty bitty bloody pieces.gtAshley is a xenophobic biblethumper who constantly bitches at you about working with aliens and her daddy issues. All the while trying to be deep with her quoting of ancient Earth poets as if she even understands the meaning of the words shes quoting.No. No no no. She mentions she believes in God exactly once in the first Mass Effect. Maybe once in each game. She neither forces her religion on you nor use it as an excuse for any of her actions. Not bible thumping at all.Her xenophobia? Its not any worse than any other human in the game. In fact you could say that shes much more tolerant and open than any other human you talk to. And honestly its amazing she isnt a fullblown racist.She lived with blame on her family for losing Shanxi to the turians in a war as recent as  years ago. So already shes being raised in an environment where people are attacking her for what her grandfather did and to cope she would have to blame turians and hate them. But she didnt. She recognizes that Shanxi was out of humanitys control and that her grandfather made the right choice by surrendering. She lives with it and she moves on.Additionally her concerns with working with nonhumans comes from an understandable place. She specifically mentions two people  Garrus and Wrex. These are nonAlliance personnel who are completely unrelated to this war with the geth and the hunt for Saren and theyre being granted freereign of the Alliances prototype topsecret warship.Garrus as a turian aka the people with whom the Alliance was at war some years ago is a security risk. Also he is a sociopath in every sense of the word. He doesnt care about other peoples lives so long as he gets the job done. This is not the trait of someone you trust with your life.Wrex a krogan aka the people the entire galaxy mistrusts for their warmongering and brutality is a mercenary. Loyal to a paycheck and nothing else. And hes doing this mission gratis? Uh no. Somethings not right there. And he failed to mention that he ever worked with Saren right off the bat which you know in a hunt for Saren would be pretty relevant information. It would either serve to further establish him as a security risk or solidify his trustworthiness by his open admission. He does neither and chooses to hide it from the crew until Shepard asks him about it.Notice how she doesnt say anything about working with Tali or Liara? Thats because unlike Garrus and Wrex they actually are related to the mission. Tali is actually sanctioned by the Alliance to work on the Normandy crew. Ambassador Udina makes it so. And she is an expert on the geth. Liara is their connection to Benezia Sarens right hand.As for her love of poetry well. You cant hate someone for having a hobby. She isnt trying to be deep about anything. She just likes poetry.gtAnd Jacob is just a major dickhole. Such a snide ass always questioning your decisions and authority with an uppity attitude and yet hes the one that abandoned the Alliance to work for a psychopathic death cult by choice. I always feel like slapping him whenever we get to the comm room after a recruitment mission especially after recruiting Tali and he makes that assmunch of a comment Oh and make sure to introduce yourself to the ships AI full well knowing what a prick hes being in saying it.Cerberus was founded on the idea that humanity must be able to stand alone in the galaxy when the time comes. Eventually that devolved into Humanity must stand alone as the power in the galaxy. So sure its a xenophobic isolationist group with extreme values.But when the Alliance was doing nothing about Reapers or Collectors Cerberus stepped up. It convinced people that it stood for the former the ability to standing alone in the galaxy when the galaxy abandons humanity rather than the latter death to all aliens! Rah! Rah!Everyone on the Normandy SR crew was fooled into this. In fact by MEs admission almost all of the SR Cerberus crew were hired specifically to make Cerberus look good in Shepards eyes. Kelly Ken Gabby all of them were hired only for the Normandy job and never worked with Cerberus beyond that cell. The only exception is perhaps Miranda but shes knows shes part of Cerberus for protection from her father more than any xenophobia.Jacob like most of the SR crew believes that Cerberus is the only force in the galaxy doing right by humans. He was fooled like any other. Later when the truth comes out he feels guilt and confusion over his work under Cerberus. In ME he asks Was I blind?His comments on each of the crew are understandable as well. He fought on Eden Prime so of course he doesnt trust Legion. Mercenaries are loyal solely to credits so of course he doesnt trust Thane.He was being nothing but welcoming to Tali out of respect for her service in the fight against Saren and she was the one dismissing him. Of course hed say something snide. Im not saying he was right or Tali was wrong but it was understandable. It just wasnt very professional.gtAnd then theres the whole KaidanAshley loyalty BS. I cant stand having them on the Normandy in ME and always send them off to Hackett. Both of them are such traitorous disloyal douchenozzles who consistently treated you like dirt. I love when you talk to Joker after dumping their asses and he salutes you saying that you deserve respect. Its so poignant and on point when it comes to those two.Traitorous? Disloyal? Sorry no. From their perspective Shepard is just as traitorous and disloyal. In fact theyve done nothing wrong. They never abandoned the Alliance to work with a known terrorist organization one by your own admission is a psychopathic death cult. They were protecting the Council serving the Alliance and doing their jobs as Spectres and soldiers.Look youre free to think what you want dislike whatever character of your choice but youve completely misinterpreted these characters.As for my three least favorite crew members in no particular order...I dont know. I like almost all of the characters of Mass Effect and incharacter I have respect for what theyve done and the trials they face. I really only dislike two squadmates.EDI because its absolutely ridiculous. It served its purpose as the ship AI and I loved it for that but its whole Pinnochio complex made me hate it.Liara because it never made sense for her to be a squadmate. Maybe a resource for information but she was only  or so years old when you meet her never mentions any combat training at all and yet you bring her into open firefights. ,masseffect,cvbh1vg,14,t5_2rc19

5381526,0,t3_3ogztc,I wonder what your opinion will be after another one or two playthroughs.  After finishing my first run I thought that ME was the best. ME was brilliant emotional roller coaster but there was that feeling that something is ending things got really serious and theres a great weight of responsibility on your shoulders. In turn in ME I was a rogue spectre with my unstoppable team and nothing could stand in my way.    After my second playthrough I was leaning more to ME as the best of series  though it wasnt so character focused like ME interaction between my teammates made up for it. It was something I wanted to see from the very beginning. Also gameplay is very smooth.    And then there was my third playthrough... I always admired the story and its progression in ME. Only later did I realize there is more to it. The atmosphere of mystery something supernatural. You feel like the hole galaxy open before you and its up to discover all the secrets. I dont know exactly how to put it into words. Lets just say that now I perceive ME as the best of trilogy despite the gameplay and other shortcomings.    Youre opinion may also change thus I recommend more playthroughs. If you made some decisions you regret or messed something up its good idea to play the same on higher difficulty. If not try changing class gender LI and morality if you like. Youll discover a lot of new things. Have fun! ,masseffect,cvzju27,2,t5_2rc19

That way it somewhat avoids the whole EarthPalaven is dead while still hearing Asari and Krogan of the st gen going on about the Reaper War.To answer some of your questions about it... Weve got one conceptual confirmation and one leak that mention Krogans. Do a CTRLF Drack in the survey leak.

You are fundamentally misinterpreting their purpose by what youre saying.That said AI will do whatever to ultimately fulfill its programmed goals  is also wrong.

See  The Geth.  they were programmed to help the Quarians attained sentience and moved beyond that.

As you develop more colonies resource bases and settlements you have to be able to keep them safe. Spend resources to recruit mercenaries and develop an AI controlled Strike Team that you can deploy to take on randomly generated timesensitive missions. Strike Team missions take many forms including settlement defense and Remnant artifact recovery which will take realtime to complete. Send your Strike Team out on a mission while you continue playing the main game and they will return    minutes later having gained rewards such as XP currency and equipment based on the success of their mission. Spend money and resources to train your Strike Team and acquire better gear for them which will increase their success rate and allow them to take on more difficult missions for greater rewards.If they do decide to put in a war table similar to DAI Im seriously hoping theyll consider letting us use the Omnitool to deploy new missions while were out on missions ourselves...

That feature has made me replay them countless times roleplaying different types of different peoples. Now with only a human I can do what? A male a female. Maybe SOME difference like we had the  different backgrounds for Shepard but thats minor compared to DAO. I really wished to play an alien race to me thats what the ME universe is I dont want to have it relatable I want my experience to be as different from reality as possible.

5590839,0,t3_3rkebp,gtIm sure this is like the hundredth time a rank confusion thread has been posted but I have a theory and Im wondering what all of you think. The ranks are clearly defined in the Codex but in ME there are several moments where the way they treat ranks doesnt make sense. Two notable cases are Kaidan taking orders from Shepard and when Shepard talks to Captain Sommers as if he is a subordinate.Some people are more equal than others Shepard is a commander in the Alliance Navy.  She is also Spectre.  She is the biggest authority in the Citadel council on fighting the Reapers.  She is also an N N denoting special forces  indicating the highest level of proficiency.  She commands the most advanced warship in the Alliance were it not so small you might consider equivalent to the Starship Enterprise.  She also has Admiral Hacketts orders to do basically whatever she can to help fight the Reapers and Admiral Hackett seems to be the de facto commander of the Alliance during the Reaper war.  Now who the hell is Captain Sommers?Another example in Star Trek  For a specific fleet operation against the Romulans Picard assigns Lt. Commander Data command of the USS Sutherland.  His first officer was also a Lt. Commander but referred to Data as Captain.  The strict Star Fleet rank is subordinate to the fact that whoever is in command of a ship is a Captain and a superior officer has put him in that command.  They dont do this in Mass Effect though everybody calls Shepard Commander but her de facto role is Captain.,masseffect,cwq3gxj,1,t5_2rc19

Bearing in mind noone knows how the Mass Relays were built it seems to me that everyone is kinda screwed without the Reapers knowledge and everyone ends up slowly dying of starvation anyway. So Destroy ends up basically the same as Refusal just with no Mass Relays.Control means that the Reapers can be made to fix the Mass Relays seeing as they know how and do a bit of housekeeping around the galaxy fixing the damage from the war before flying into a sun or whatever.Just my opinion.,masseffect,cwroxmc,3,t5_2rc19

We dont need to be over saturated with Mass Effect across all media. One of the reasons I love Mass Effect is because there are only a few games out and that they dont push them out yearly.

5949134,0,t1_cxzd6mu,Thanks for sharing.         I couldnt kill EDI either but I interpreted Sheps journey as a search to end the threat of reapers amp see the bigger picture to end the established cycle of synthetics vs organics. As mentioned Destroy continues the second part so it leaves the job halfway done. Its also established by the geth amp reapers amp multiple bits of ME lore that the rise of synthetics is a common occurrence in the ME universe and already happened with rogue AI several times in ME amp again in ME amp ME DLC. So I always interpreted Sheps experiences as character development. My Shep altered herhis ideas as the evidence presented itself ever more clearly. Things like learning about Javik and his failure it makes the overarching permanence of the threat more tangible knowing there was a survivor from the last cycle saving the gethquarians or dealing with the guilt of their deaths and hanging out with EDI amp Legion showed my Shep that A true AI isnt necessarily good or ill it depends just like other sentients and that B there has to be another way than organics vs synthetics to end the cycle of death amp not just for now. For those reasons my evil sheps choose Control amp my good sheps choose Synth but they can never bring themselves to choose Destroy. Although sometimes just sometimes they occaisionally shoot Starchild in the head amp let the cycle continue D,masseffect,cxzgmsj,4,t5_2rc19

6002192,0,t1_cy6etzs,My first reaction Oh good god dont play Dragon Age Inquisition then lol XD Some of the romances there are pretty explicit hilarious and adorable though imhoI can understand the aversion of actively engaging sex scenes and leaving a lot of things to the imagination. Hell there are plenty of fanfics that have embellished the Garrus romance scene beyond that head touch that actually happens in ME. On a personal level yes I agree that relationships do not require coitus to actually seal the deal but I think in Bioware settings they are somewhat appropriate. A lot of these characters are soldiers in the midst of war or on the eve of a battle there the expectation of survival. I personally think that in that sort of situation the need of physical comfort and reassurance is therapeutic and desired. If Andromeda had a romancable squadmate whose race was something akin to Salarians then I might agree that an actual sexually engaging scene is silly since Salarians dont have a sex drive. If its with a human or another race whose nature would fall along the lines of yea!

Close enough to the edges of any given galaxy Im certain they can for those specified  years between cycles but in the space between the galaxies? Thats stretching it. The problem comes down to resources.It would only take the reapers roughly  days to get to andromeda from the milky way.  The fact that it took them nearly  to get back to the milky way suggests they are already pretty far out there.I agree there are some plot holes but they did move the citadel pretty far across the galaxy and their type of energy kept the derelict reaper alive for  million years.  I guess Im suggesting that during the rebuilding of the citadel they figured it out.  Just as the prothean scientists figured out how to at least alter the reaper signal used to control it.,masseffect,cyrz7m9,3,t5_2rc19

6286989,0,t1_cz3roeh,PC Mods   JohnPs Alternate Mass Effect Happy Ending Mod   It changes the destroy ending so that it only destroy the Reapers.

The Normandy also doesnt crash land.   It also changes a few more things that keep it more faithful than the original MEHEM but still with a more positive ending.

I happened to be in the store the day it was released and my friend who works there recommended it to me.I bought it played it and never looked back. Preordered  amp  the day it was possible bought all DLC. And it was worth every penny. The end of  is an mitigated mess but the other  of the series is the best damn franchise Ive played in video games.

Ashley is an NCO depending on whom you ask tend to be the underlying foundations of any professional military with excellent technicalcombat skills and by Virmire has proven herself in the field against the Geth. Pairing her up with STG a fighting force whose entire doctrine is avoiding a straightup fight seemed to be the best way to cover their risks. . Kaidan is an excellent senior officer with proven technical skills. It would make sense for him to protect the bomb. Given how important the bomb is to the entire operations Ive always felt that assigning the responsibility to him was a worth choice. As to whom to save. Kaidan has set the bomb to go off. Come hell or high water its going to detonate and with a loud bang. At this point the mission is near completion and Shepard is now trying to extract assets from the field. Going after Ashley allows him to save an experienced NCO along with the STG. Trying to rescue Kaidan increases the risk of failure.

I find it more likely that he doesnt wish for his end in the Destroy sense because he cannot oversee in any way a possible solution if Destroy is picked he has no certainty that the problem has been solved. It goes against his programming but not because of selfpreservation.We know that the Reapers arent evil even though its convenient to think of them in that way. They harvest for a purpose we know understand even though it is flawed. Selfpreservation is not the Reapers directive the solution to the natural evolution towards an eternal syntheticorganic war is.

So instead of just doing a random  round match of horde mode with random objectives every other round theres are specific objectives and scripted events that make it feel like a single player mission.Some levels are exclusive to the game mode while others could be levels from the campaign that are made available in this coop mode after completing the level in the campaign maybe just expanded or with extra objectives added to make it more challenging and fun for multiple players.,masseffect,d0fz7rm,1,t5_2rc19

He survived the raid because that was his goal. When the slavers were hunting for survivors John used his fellow survivors as distractions to keep himself safe.

6900699,0,t3_4a9mq5,As you say ME doesnt really count. All the weapons are the same.ME I think the Locust and Phalanx are pretty hard to argue with for SMGs and pistols although the Tempest is a little more charming than the overpowered Locust. For assault rifles sniper rifles and shotguns? I like the heavies. In my mind sniper rifles are for taking things out in one big shot so the Widow wins. The Mattock is pretty obviously superior to the Revenant on the whole but the Revenant is a better CQC weapon which I prefer. Claymore Vanguards are awesome. Doesnt hurt that outside of the Phalanx those are all the best looking weapons for each class.ME I still have the same ideas about sniper rifles but I have come to like the Raptor on a Soldier. Probably have to give it to the Black Widow on the whole though. For pistols it has to be the Paladin for the sheer brutality of it all. SMGs arent particularly fun compared to the alternatives in  but in the right circumstances the Hurricane can be ridiculously fun. Assault rifles and shotguns though? So. Many. Options. I think Id probably have to give it to the Graal because its versatile and fun but the Claymore Piranha Wraith and Venom all put up some competition. For Assault rifles I guess Id have to say the Mattock but Ive had a lot of fun with the Chakram launcher especially on a Vanguard the Striker the Revenant and the Valkyrie. Bonus points to the Valkyrie for general smexiness.I capitalize weapon and class names also powers still not sure if I should do that.Edit Ooooh wait did you mean classes classes and not weapon classes?,masseffect,d0yigze,8,t5_2rc19

In all derivations of general relativity that I can remember the two are equal and calculations follow. The interconnection between rest and inertial mass is tenuous and I could fathom something changing that symmetry just enough to allow a rest mass to be accelerated as though it had a smaller inertial mass.

7679329,0,t3_4khzz4,Eh I wouldnt bother.If you do everything possible in ME you shouldnt have trouble filling one reputation bar completely and the other about    full as well. Just make sure to put the necessary ability points into Charm or Intimidate to max out dialogue choices.And when it comes to ME the bonus you get from importing a full reputation bar character isnt that massive honestly. Its nice and all but its not like having a full bar in ME vs  full is going to make any real difference in ME.Concerning the reputation system in ME it isnt bad at all. You might say that its somewhat reasonable that those who go a mix of ParagonRenegade wont have enough persuasion or intimidation ability to optimally solve EVERY situation. Thats simply the downside of that reputation approach. On the plus side you do have the most actual dialogue choices due to being able to both charm and intimidate in MOST situations.But again just like in ME you can open up all Paragon choices quite easily even when you occasionally take Renegade choices.And in the end  the ME trilogy is something thats meant to be played several times. There are simply too many variables in the game to experience even half the content in a single playthrough. As such I wouldnt worry about making the Perfect run the very first time. Youll simply end up spoiling your experience by reading guides or trying to minmax situations instead of enjoying the story unfold naturally.Just go with your instincts and youll enjoy the game a lot more the first time around. ,masseffect,d3f3dw4,2,t5_2rc19

I always found Dragon Age narratives and characters to not be up to the Mass Effect standard but that is of course subjective as you say.Aveline Wynne Ogrhen all have something in common I didnt remember their names until you said them. Needless to say I dont remember much else about them and found them the opposite of memorable.,masseffect,d3gzenb,2,t5_2rc19

Suddenly  a man in a town on the other side of Skyrim asks you to retrieve his stolen family heirloom candlestick.  Oh  look  I happen to have kept this one candlestick even though Im running the Thieves Guild and would have gotten a decent bit of septims for it. Is this it?Oh it is?  My reward?  Oh  a ladle?

If AIs are justified in defending themselves against organics and wipe them out as a result thats all the Catalyst needs in order to be right.gt I count four... somebody tried to kill them for no good reason...Javik also mentions something from his cycle cant recall the details. But four is still plenty in the timespan and part of the galaxy we get to see. Especially when its . And again if organics are the bad guys it still applies.I didnt mean to say that the geth are like the Luna AI just that the stuff I talked about origin of conflict being irrelevant applied there.Im just saying EDI went through a phase where she was a bad security system away from Interstellar Skynet. She evolves into something else but her origins are drenched in blood.I didnt mention what I conveniently didnt mention because I thought it was already implicit in your comment.

The one constant in all my Shepards is competence the character doesnt make much sense without it to me so I dont end up making choices that are obviously dumb like dumb choices during the Suicide Mission but my Shepards do decide to take gambles that occasionally backfire.

The team leaned into the more personal aspect he said but its still Mass Effect. You can still expect the grandscale of space and a driving sense of theres something else out there.  When we started the Mass Effect trilogy there was this idea of it being very cinematic and movielike he said. So having a singular titular hero that people recognized and they had the same name and the same gender and everything like that the same look  that was important at the time.I think thats something weve moved away from and we want to embrace choice and diversity with what you can do in the game.

Even the Leviathans had the brilliant idea to get an AI to figure out their synthetic problems.The way I see it all problems stem mostly from the Reapers. Sure synthetics will usually have at least one slaughter under their belt but organics seem to do far more. Perhaps the hybrid nature of the Reapers eludes that both halves are equally murderous.

Jacob fell out from the Alliance not because they were too lawful but because they werent doing what he saw as good.  Everything about the character in ME speaks to a man with an ingrained respect for order and hierarchy to deliver safety and justice.  As for Liara just because shes got the Shadow Brokers network doesnt necessarily mean she can no longer be Lawful Good.  She would have to be extremely judicious in how she used her power though.  Think of Liara as a DampD paladin  She can do things that you wouldnt think of as being traditional Lawful Good.  She can seek out and slay evil to protect the greater good.  Despite her operating outside the authority of the governments she still seems to have a lot of respect for order and the galactic civilizations.

For years I never saw any fan art or fan made youtube vids using a female shepard and it was a far fringe thing to use the female character. Then it suddenly became a trending thing online and the majority of the fan art I saw in the months after release had Shepard as a female. I literally asked why that was nothing at all negative about that dude.I used her as another example of one of the fringe things that has a disproportionate representation online. Garrus is a huge fan favorite so he makes sense to be everywhere. Yet I see Tali just as often even though shes much less used by people. I find that interesting.Calling out a community that is behaving poorly is not childish. Ive been apart of many communities online and off over the years and this sorta toxic behavior is a very bad sign. If this many people are actively shunning someone for asking a question like this thats a problem. This is a place for all fans to gather and talk about ideas we clearly share a common passion for Mass Effect and Im sure many of us have been playing since day  and if youre like me were crapping their pants with excitement when you found out the guys from KOTOR were going to be making another space game.

Probably the most fun in a multiplayer Ive ever had.And as baseballfanatic said you can do Legions mission after the IFF if you want it doesnt affect the squads survival. How I did it was when I started the Derelict Reaper mission I already had every single other mission and assignment finished after the Collector Ship. Soon as I got Legion I talked to him as much as he would let me then I went upstairs to Kelly telling me he wanted to see me. Then since it doesnt count as a planet I assume thats why anyway thats how I took it since its a ship I could do the mission while EDI set up the IFF and then when I got back EDI told me its all ready and the crew being taken scene happened. ,masseffect,d5ggmae,6,t5_2rc19

Let the first experience sink in think about what you want to do on the next playthrough play something else for a while and then start it. KoTOR  and  are good games that have that scifi feeling although lore wise you need to have affinity for the SW setting otherwise you wont like them. However if you have a new gaming PC going back to those old graphics might feel like a waste of money. Medieval RPGs are the only ones left. You could go with The Witcher  an amazing game. The DLCs are pretty good too and its a beautiful game to play on a new PC. There are no carry over decisions though as far as I know and you certainly wont feel attached to the characters as much as you did with the whole ME series. But its a huge game the perfect one to play on summer vacation. The Dragon Age games are nice too and going from DAO to DAI you can almost see the similarities between how they handled them and the ME series.

Or the whole Citadel in ME and ME...Omega in ME it felt just right the Afterlife felt exactly like a nightclub not like a large room with controls storage units and suddenly cafetables...The oldschoolish immersion of main quest locations in ME still remain unmatched. The mission on the Geth dreadnought in ME with Tali is still nothing compared to the awesomeness of the very similar part of the Lair Of The Shadow Broker etc... its like they ran out of that magical something that would allow them to add layers of atmospheric uniqueness and immersion to the game.And endings...I  hate them the way they are even after the extended cut.. There fucking should have been a proper classic happy ending for those who wanted it Shepard destroys the Reapers and while injured but alive gets teleported back to Earth and kisseshugs whoever was in his squad before that. As simple as that. Its not an indie game for a few elite connoisseurs. Its still a mass market game and there are reasons why so many books and movies and games have a happy end.

8574352,0,t1_d6cyg7g,The fundamental problem with engineers in ME is that anything Engineer Shepard can do Tali can do at least as well.  Its fairly important that Shepard be able to inflict decent damage because your squadmates suck at shooting around cover but having Shepard use powers doesnt confer any particular advantages just set your squad to only autocasting defensive powers and use their powers instead.  Adept Shepard is at least sort of useful because you dont get Liara until later and its rather difficult to actually retrieve Liara without good biotics.  SoldierVanguardInfiltrator Shepard are overwhelmingly the strongest in ME though.  Leave the powers to your squadmates damage and tankiness are most important for Shepard.Also I hate to break it to you but Tali Garrus and Engineer Shepard is the single worst team I can think of to go retrieve Liara.  The armature fight on foot looks scary but its actually really easy.  The armature wont walk around your cover dispatch the shock troopers and dont stick your head out when the armatures firing a siege pulse and the fights basically free.  The really scary fight when retrieving Liara is fighting the Krogan.  The Krogans basically immune to tech his healths way higher than his shields and sabotage wont stop him from charging in and meleeing you.  You need to get him off his feet to stop his regeneration and melee attack and you need good damage output to pummel your way through his massive health.  You mightve gotten away with GarrusTaliEngineer Shepard on lower difficulties but I shudder to think what that fight would be like on Hardcore or Insanity.,masseffect,d6ddkew,1,t5_2rc19

Lets see the problems... Every character is onedimensional  especially the new characters. This is exacerbated by.... Massive character derailment. An inexcusable amount of characters are doing things previous games went out of their way to showcase how they were against that thing theyre doing.. Also exacerbated by whittling down other returning characters to one part of their personality. Some characters that were threedimensional in ME are now defined entirely by memes.. Lack of consequences. Every single choice you have made in the past  even ones in the SAME FUCKING GAME  dont affect the ending after more than seven years of CHOICES AFFECT ENDING!!! . Shitty multiplayer component which got more focus than the fucking single player. In a previously singleplayer series. Absolutely inexcusable given how shit both components were.. Homogenising gameplay even more. There is no reason to pick any particular class because they can all do everything.. Lore assassination. Some of the lore entries are now different and even outright contradictory to what they were in previous games and things stated in the same fucking game.. Huge lack of dialogue compared to the first and even the ugh second games. The first had tons of dialogue. The second had an acceptable amount of dialogue. The third? Hope you like one line you cant even respond to!. No proper side quests. Either every quest is part of the main quest was obviously part of the main quest or you scan things and give them to people in one of the laziest systems of all time.. All of the DLC is obviously removed from the base game even though more than half of them are plotintegral. Dont believe me look at how one of the tiein comics would be resolved in ME! or the controversy about the onedimensional new character or the fucking origins of the fucking major antagonists. And the last one? Shitty apology that doesnt even fit the game along with breaking even more bits of lore and derailing even more characters.. Morality system has now casualised so you dont even get consequences for how youve been acting. . Incredibly short missions. Every mission is extremely short  its a battle with a corridor in between and characters talking to each other with you having no control then a last battle before the end of the mission.. Deus Ex Machine galore! Every single arc of the game is resolved by a deus ex machina that completely robs them of any moral difficulty. Apparently an entire sentence is all it takes to stop a war! . Firing the original writer of ME and ME. There are countless more but those are the really obvious ones. In short ME took the RP out of the G which ME was already in danger of losing  and failed to live up to the rough diamod that is ME.ME was the definitive ME game  it is the Mass Effect game. Mass Effect  was a medicore Mass Effect game but a goodish game overall. Mass Effect  isnt a good Mass Effect game let alone a good game. And the majority agree.

8633726,0,t3_4y18ts,GraphicsLighting ENB and SweetFX mods for all three games. For consistency Id recommend the ENB and SweetFX mods released by Carinth on the nexusmods. GraphicsTextures Everyones already mentioned MEUITM and ALOT textures. Im just gonna echo them.Story mods ME doesnt have any AFAIK. ME has one really important one the Arrival Triggering Mod. It makes it so that Arrival only ever triggers after the Collector Base mission. There are two versions A and B. A sets the triggering to happen immediately after  the Collector Base mission. B triggers it based on Legions conversations. A little known fact I certainly didnt know it when I looked at this mod is that Legion has more conversations just like every other squadmate but you have to do missions before hell go to the next one. Version B puts the Arrival triggering after a mission played after the Collector Base but you have to talk to Legion first. This is the version I have I just make sure theres at least one N assignment left to do postCollector Base run. I keep the mission Aria gives you the one where you can recover an Eclipse stockpile thats guarded by three Ymir Heavy Mechs undone until after the suicide runME most of what everyones already said.

8640208,1,t1_d6le784,Sorry but that doesnt hold up at all.Firstly the person youre interpreting for was claiming the admirals brainwashed them something thats largely speculation.  Theres certainly no proof that the last three centuries worth of quarian leaders have done any such thing only proof that the current leaders are warmongers who want to take their planet back details and the geth be damned.Secondly what YOU are saying doesnt make sense either because the entire quarian population knows about the Morning War.  Every quarian knows the details of the event and what happened.  Tali details all of this info to you in the first game and gets defensive if Shepard in me  tries to call her out on the fact that the quarians were the ones at fault for what happened to them.. Not out of ignorance but pride and racism.  She is adamant the quarians were not in any way at fault for trying to wipe out the geth and that they were wronged by the council to not get any help despite knowingly going against their rules of not creating any AI once they started to lose in their war.Claiming ignorance doesnt hold up.  Every quarian knows why they have no homeworld and tons of details about the morning warits literally their own history and the reason for their current nomadic lifestyle as a species.And part of that info is the knowledge that their ancestors started a war against their own creations and lost thus forcing them from their homeworld.All quarians know that the geth are more than just reaper pawns because they literally created them.  They know that the geth served their ancestors faithfully and that they were not the aggressors but fought for their right to exist when the quarians threatened them.  Theres no proof this isnt general knowledge and no reason it should be considered as such because tali told Shepard of this info in me  and at the time she was just one of many the same as everyquarian that goes out on their pilgrimage.  ,masseffect,d6lmvhw,-2,t5_2rc19

8645773,1,t1_d6mbcbq,gtThe Quarians tried to murder them.The humans tried to murder Skynet!gtThe Geth defended themselves and drove the Quarians off but did not wipe them out as Legion pointed out. Then where did the other billions of quarians go during the Geth War? Did the geth make them disappear in a puff of pixie dust? You dont get to claim selfdefense after committing a thorough genocide that wipes out . of a civilization that had been spacefaring for hundreds of years already and likely had a population in the tens to hundreds of billions. That clearly goes far beyond selfdefense. Thats literally a lower survival rate after the year Geth War than for Jews in Poland after the year Nazi occupation. Speaking of which would the USSR have been justified if they killed all but  of the ethnic Germans living in Europe? gtThen the Quarians tried to kill them AGAIN in order to retake their homeworld once the Quarians foudn a way to basically blind the Geth which forced them to defend themselves.What exactly do you expect them to do when the geth have shown themselves to be absolutely averse to any negotiation read all diplomats sent to their territory even by nonquarian parties were killed on sight and have repeatedly given every indication that theyre allied with the Reapers with their only contact with the outside being an army of them helping Sovereign? Do you expect the quarians to just let themselves go extinct while the same machines that genocided their race squats on the graves of their ancestors? Heck even ignoring that was there any logical reason for them not to wipe out the Reapers allies when they have a weapon that will let them do it with few to no losses on their part? Was there any logical reason anyone else with the same opportunity wouldnt have destroyed the geth?Any sane person in the galaxy wouldve done it. Not even just the quarians. If you gave Garrus a button that wiped out all the geth hed push it in a heartbeat. gtWhat the hell were the Geth supposed to do exactly? Sit there and let the Quarians kill them all? Leave Rannoch as Legion admits they can do and live on some space stations in the middle of nowhere. Simple enough. In addition make some actual moves that would convince the galactic community that theyre nonhostile which they have stubbornly refused to do in the last  years letting the socalled heretics be their sole representatives instead. This whole arc is stupid and didnt need to happen.Alternatively simply leave after defeating the enemy conventionally in the initial conflict rather than duplicating the Holocaust ten thousand times over. ,masseffect,d6mbzvg,-2,t5_2rc19

Reaper dont have any moral value their only purpose is harvesting organic and synthetic life to maintain balance universe.

8747639,0,t1_d6yt1co,That would be such a cool idea. The Shepard siblings get tied up in Sarens plot in two separate ways. One on Eden Prime and one elsewhere in the galaxy. They both know what they saw but no one else believes them. Reassured by their mutual experiences they both go rouge to investigate and stop Saren each one in their respective ship with their respective crew.In  one dies to the collector attack and stays dead throughout the game. The other shepard which you get to choose reaches out to the only group that is willing to investigate the attack and the connected colony disappearances. The game plays out in a similar fashion to ME but with a secondary plot of working to find and record the body of the now dead shepard. The end of the game reveals the collectors were working to create a human reaper modeled after the fallen shepard who is kept semialive throughout the process. You destroy the reaper save the other shepard and Cerberus restores them to health but with the reaper  cybernetics still implanted. starts with the attack on Earth just as before. Reapertech Shepard is in the same limbo as Shepard was in the real game since they are worried about what happened while she was held captive. During the attack the two shepards fight side by side along with Anderson to get to either of their ships and get in space. Reapertech Shepards ship arrives and we have a similar scene with Anderson staying behind except now the Shepard you played as in  stays on earth with Anderson while the other travels to unite the galaxy.The game splits into two connected plots one that we experienced in  and another on Earth where the grounded shepard and anderson work to fend off the reapers as well as uncover vital information for the formation of the crucible to send to space shepard. The game culminates in the battle on earth where again both shepards bring their forces to bear on London and fight side by side to push towards the citadel. Earth shepard dies or maybe they dont with the breathing in the rubble clip to suggest they live during the push while space shepard makes it and unveils a horribly unsatisfying ending.In summary I love the idea of a Shepard tagteam and the ability to have sort of parallel yet frequently converging plots throughout the series. I think it would give tons more exposure to the vast galaxy that the story is set in while still giving the feel that each individual location is more than just a pit stop on a sightseeing tour for shepard. It also lets to develop two different characters and see how they interact.Perhaps a good cop bad cop relationship is formed. How interesting would it be to see good cop shepard die and bad cop shepard wreak havoc and do anything to avengesave the other? Then you get to see what good cop Shepard thinks of what happened for their sake. AGH Im in love with this idea.,masseffect,d6z3y71,30,t5_2rc19

The missions tab is different and a bit more crowded so watch out for that. In relationships there are triggers in the game for new players to instantly initiate new relationships watch out for them.

Unless you can source a better one. Half as fast of the reapers is still  years for endtoend travel plus fuel costs. Its not going to be a quick recovery. Not a good one. gtExcept they werent? Where did you get that idea?Destroyed ! gone for good. The first hit on earth was a government facility. And IIRC the Turians didnt even know who was in charge. Plus most combat ships being used int eh final stand its a shitshow with no clear leaders. gtSalarian planet was never hitThey also have no respect from the other races they immediately pulled back ships and if you cured the genophage dont help at all.

Theres a  year gap between humanity discovering the Prothean beacons and humanity joining the Council.  years. Thats all it took for humanity to go from isolated to its own part of the galaxy and completely unheard of by any other species to one of the Council races. If humans are a threat to Reapers during Shepards lifetime then it stands to reason they were already a threat  years earlier  years earlier hell maybe even as far back as a thousand years earlier. After all Reapers dont attack every  years so their attacks have to set all life back thousands of years. So what are the chances that all alien life is so coincidentally synchronized that every race theoretically capable of joining the Council has done so by ME? What if theres a race thats  years off?  years off?  years off? All those races which might be very technologically advanced and are just years shy of discovering the Prothean beacons have to be purged as well. These are the races that we havent heard of but most certainly need destroying. This reminds me of the Hogwarts debate re how many students and staff there actually are.

9279749,0,t1_d8rmge9,sorry i got carried away with my other stuff and forgot to type anything about other reasons shep died ok so my take on it is that shep died for a variety of reasons to prove how far from ready everyone is. i.e. if even shep amp the normandy get blasted who could possibly have done better? to set shep up as more than human. shep couldnt otherwise have retroactively been setup with the extra stuff in hisher system outside of MEs reaper upgrades a la cerberus troopers phantoms etc. the lazarus project got us there. gives us the upgradable player elements we see in ME. to further set shep up as the impossible hero. many lifeforms have saved the day in the ME universe. afawk shep is the only one to truly come back from the dead ready to save everyone. a pretty common theme in many cultures stories. this helps cement sheps status as the natural leader or focal point as well as making them in some way more relatable even to otherwise wildly different cultures.Also while its never a huge deal as far as story content goes sheps organicsynthetic setup is referred to by legion the catalyst the illusive man... I think there are others too but I cant for the life of me remember right now.

I romanced Kaidan too Id be interested in reading your reaction writeup after ME. I like Garrus in ME and by the end of ME hes basically the Varric to my Hawke. Liara and Tali also get much much more interesting. New squadmates are fantastic. I second the advice that you should only play Arrival after youve completed ME. Shadow Broker and Overlord can be done anywhere mid game. Kasumi Stolen Memory should be done before Horizon I think since you get a new squadmate plus a nice new gun.As for ME From Ashes should be done ASAP after Priority Palaven. Leviathan should be done after Priority Thessia. Omega is not an important DLC and if you get it you could do it whenever since its selfcontained theres a natural point for doing it actually but spoilers. Citadel is a must but I played this one way after completing ME and I liked it that way. I feel like if it is done mid game or even towards the end it might interfere somewhat with the emergency of the whole grand scheme? Another important order Grissom Academy must be done before Priority Citadel II which is triggered after you complete Priority Tuchanka.

Exploration of unknown areas.. Less linear missions give players the choice on how to progress beyond certain points for example.. Better character control the jumpsprintscalecover feature is probably one of my least favorite things about ME.. More focus on finding powerful or cool items one of the things I love most about rpgs is the gear progression. Whether its by crafting buying random or boss drops. In ME I had the Blood Dragon armor after a short while and had it equiped till the end of the game.. Side missions to unlock hidden skill linespowers maybe something like the vampirewerewolf system from TESgames. so an advantage for a couple stats but disadvantages for others..

If you were dealing with a bunch of Alliance Military personnel for example thatd be fine but youve said one of your PCs is a blackmarket operator  that doesnt exactly speak to polite society which is why I had thought a more freereign approach like mercs might work.But again your decision. The best way to have them work together is to either give them all a communal goal theyll want to complete like their first mission reveals part of a star map that leads to a secret cache of treasure or show that they operate well together and that doing so would be lucrative. The first option is pretty universal but the second option requires each PC to want to be involved in combat usually. And with your salarian PC again maybe Im wrong but he doesnt exactly sound like the military type.Perhaps a scientist has obtained sensitive research data  data that is wanted by some other organisation government or criminal. So hes hired a few protectors  not specifically mercenaries but bodyguards.

9710918,0,t1_da9zxu8,They specifically stated that we were heading towards Golden Worlds picked up on long range scans of the Helius Cluster within the Andromeda Galaxy. Coincidence has always been a massive factor in frontier exploration and the alien ruins feels like a coincidence moment where the AI ran into some sort of trouble either en route or upon arrival and it has something to do with derelict and nonmaintained ruins from either a local power or the remnants of such. This is a prevalent theme in scifi as well as standard history. You go out into presumably uninhabited territory to find that someone either preexists you or did and left behind traces of knowledge and technology that are foreign and perhaps better than your own. The European Dark Ages demonstrate this Marco Polo demonstrates this Star Trek resides almost entirely in this etc. Even in Mass Effect the Protheans and Reapers represent this coincidental factor albeit both later demonstrate purposeful planting of such knowledge and technology.In summation I doubt that we scanned the Helius Cluster of Andromeda from the distance we are and said OH MAN SEE THAT RUIN ON X? LETS GO GET IT WITH NO ROUTE BACK! A scanner might be able to pick up mineral contents and atmospheric makeup or at least proximity to a star and likelihood of livable conditions but I doubt they could get that specific. I do see it as an attempt to establish an intergalactic colony with the four main council races cooperating as opposed to the New World colonization in the real timeline where the powers at large competed.

9802223,0,t3_5flwwc,I was thinking about ParagonRenegade system and honestly its a good system its just not well implemented into games. It feels very artificial imposed. Ive been asshole to everyone Ive met Wrex so let me tell you these Krogans will be tools for Saren!. Changing the traits that this system will be based on wont fix it.What I was thinking about is changing it to actual reputation system. Your actions and dialogues still account to one ParagonRenegade bucket but along with that they are also added into other categories Calm or Volatile? Nice guy or Asshat? Merciful or Ruthless killer? Gentle or Violent? ProGalactic civilization or ProHumanity? Yay synthetics or Nay synthetics? And more categories could be added if they are needed.Now there is also concept of popularity similar to neutral points in ME. It basically describes how much noise your actions have how much you are known. The more popular you are the larger impact your actions can have on conversations.For example say you are violent female character and you need to get intel from corrupted merchant. Depending on your popularity the dialogue could go like thisLow popularity  Merchant Im not giving you intel  Player Yeah do you know who I am?  M Certainly nobody worth my attentionMedium popularity  M Im not giving you intel  P Im a bad bitch you sure want to keep it for yourself?  M Hmm... Yeah I know a little about your past actions. We can work that ourHigh popularity  M Im not giving you intel  P Im eating trash like you on breakfast so better dont resist  M In a hindsight Ill just give you that intelIf you havent got it yet the dialogue is based on your past Actions as well as on how much people Know about your actionsDifferent characters require different popularity levels to know you for example your squadmates always know all your little sins while random pedestrians need quite high popularity to know you that wellThat creates so many possibilities like you could save colonies and punch people hate aliens and like synthetics be paragon in the streets and renegade in the sheets.Furthermore it also opens possibility of other characters using your popularity against you. Abovementioned merchant could parry a Gentle player with Or what youll punch me? Yeah sure.. This makes it so morality system is not pure reward sometimes there are penalties associated with it so you wont be taking always same options without second thought.However regardless of system used in game one I wrote above included it needs to be hidden from player. And for that reason I honestly dont want to know much about system used in Andromeda. Itll just needlessly impose certain decisions for sake of playing along system.,masseffect,dalc2m7,7,t5_2rc19

9803859,0,t3_5fmccl,This is my understanding so take it for what its worth. Imagine genetically engineering some of the greatest military minds and savage conquerors in the history of the human race in to one person. Atilla the Hun Genghis Kahn Alexander the Great Adolf Hitler in one human being. And imagine feeding them nothing but information on how to kill maim and destroy every advanced species in the galaxy. Not just their bodies but their weapons their ships their governments and how they fight as a unit. Okeers goal wasnt just to cure the genophage. Grunt was the promise of a unified Krogan species to sweep over the galaxy like a flame and take it by force.Wrex harnesses that and gives it purpose and turns it in to a real Krogan. NOT just an idea or a synthetic being with all the promise and none of the blood. Its why Clan Wreev Chief was so opposed to Grunt until the death of the Flesher  Thresher Maw.

Shielding buffing crowdcontrolling and for the few characters that had it later on healing.I remember the barrierguard mechanic for magefighters in particular only lasting one to two hits on the hardest difficulty meant having to manage CDs and aggro between a tank and offtank my char and Cassandra to be able to reapply it without actually taking HP damage which you were more limited to heal.Without going for some specifically broken skills seras ult skill being the one I remember most I remember the game being challenging for what it was as long as I wasnt overleveled for the content. Still the games fault for having a couple of broken skills here and there.And dragons in particular were quite challenging and fun if you faced them at their intended level or slightly under it. They had plenty of raidlike mechanics that required coordination.The tactical play was not redundant for me its the one I used  of the time but it was a pain because of its badly designed UI and camera plus a couple of janky problems when issuing commands during certain animation or transitions that lead to them not being recognized at certain times. I agree that was a mess but Ive gotten used to worse so it did fine for me. Not an excuse for it though.All in all I liked its gameplay more than any party based RPGs that I could recall of lately. Certainly more than for example Tyrannys and Pillar of Eternitys which are the games Ive been playing lately.I do agree wholeheartedly about gated missions breaking the pace if you werent thorough with sidequests and fillerlike miscellaneous objectives littering the map.

Yeah up until you learn why the Reapers were created that seems like the best choice but the idea behind the Reapers is that biological life has a natural endpoint and it will almost assuredly be when biologics create a technological race like the Geth that will wipe them out. The Reapers harvest is to essentially just hit the reset button every couple thousand years before that happens.In a Destroy universe youve won the day but havent really secured biological lifes future. In the end maybe thousands of years down the line someone will fuck with AI and create a race that will wipe out biological life. Thats the inevitable endpoint.All three of the solutions have their downsides which is what actually makes it an interesting choice but the destroy option is the only one that puts a bandaid on the problem rather than solve it.,masseffect,dc79j9p,4,t5_2rc19

In the real world molecules with mirrorimage versions have the same physical properties but completely unpredictable biological properties sometimes none at all or only a minor effect. There would not be an allergic reaction. There are many compounds that realworld humans can safely consume the dextro and levo versions. It has absolutely nothing to do with DNA or amino acids alone its about all asymmetrical molecules relevant to life. At different points in the game people will give different reasons what the difference is. I totally understand that this is a fictional universe so they can do whatever they want but if theyre going to use real words why not use the real actual concept?

Maybe some cataclysmic event negates any difference between the endings all Reaper tech self destructs  years after ME and infighting amongst Citadel species splits the galaxy that kinda thing but then what is the point of returning to the MWG?

Even with a large crew of say  people theyd be able to give each crew member hundreds of square metres of area each.

If you enjoy Andromeda Im sure it wont be hard to convince yourself to go back and play through them.

You made decisions in the trilogy but letting himher die on Eden prime couldnt be your decision as a player. It was just you leaving the game as it is without finishing the adventure. You may even call your story a fanfiction but your story definitely would not be describing Commander Shepards adventure as a story of the protagonist in Biowares game called Mass Effect.In contrast Shepards look was never set in stone. There is a default looking Shepard yes but there is no canon looking Sheprad. Its a big difference. In other words Commander Shepard appearance isnt specified anywhere in Biowares tale not even the gender but the Commander sure as hell survived Eden prime. ,masseffect,dd1blbc,12,t5_2rc19

10530839,0,t1_dd1rwl3,I could go on for hours about it. But I guess Ill cut it down as much as I canMass Effect  is irrelevant to the story. It doesnt really advance the Reapers from ME and it kills off the villian it introduces by the end of the game. Not only that it gives you the option to destroy the Collector base so it kills off its villian and gives you the option to destroy the thing you spent the game working towards.Now it does introduce a bunch of things which help expand the lore of the universe. Ultimately Cerberus as a whole are one of the only good things to carry over.You can say that Legion is good. Or Mordin. Or Tali and the fleshing out of the Quarians. Or any of the characters. But ME makes a massive mistake It lets you kill off all of the characters. That completely fucks with ME.Mass Effect  was written in a way that had to do its best at dealing with all the problems ME left it. Mass Effect  left it with no story to continue no pieces of the plot to use and almost no major characters it could use effectively.If the Suicide Mission wasnt in ME then ME would be much better. If ME didnt let you destroy both the Collectors and their base ME would actually have plot things it could work with. If ME spent its time continuing the story of ME rather than being a sort of side plot that is ultimately irrelevant due to the choices it gives you then ME would be much better.,masseffect,dd1saq9,26,t5_2rc19

10537763,0,t1_dd1y0ff,As a fan of both because people always think youre bashing Star Wars when this comes up Id absolutely say that Mass Effect is science fiction and Star Wars is Fantasy.Definition Trying to define genres through necessary and sufficient conditions is a hopeless pursuit. Id suggest not trying to define it at all but taking a pragmatic approach A thing is a science fiction thing if it is similar to other science fiction things. Mass Effect is science fiction not because it has super plausible sciencey explanations for everything but because it explores topics AI first contact fermi paradoxes that are commonly explored in science fiction because it uses character tropes modernesque militaries scientists diplomats sexy robots that are commonly used in science fiction because it uses plot devices and plot structures that are found in other science fiction and because it has a similar aesthetic and setting to a lot of other science fiction. By contrast Star Wars only uses aliens and robots because they look cool Star Wars entire thing is looking cool. Its characters tend to be soldiers mercenaries smugglers orphaned farmer boys princesses and monastic warrior wizards. Its stories and character tropes are straight out of fantasy. It shares aesthetics with some science fiction but very little else.They both use AIs but Mass Effect uses them to actually explore issues like how humans might treat them and whether or not they are sentient. A science fictiony thing to do. Star Wars uses them because BB is adorable and its funny to see CPO be harmlessly infuriated by being disassembled. Not a science fictiony thing to do.Biotics are science fictionier than the force not because ME uses slightly scienceier jargon so much as because it makes an attempt to incorporate biotic individuals into society in a more realistic way Star Wars turns them into a warrior wizard order of badasses.Its also science fiction because it makes an attempt to justify its unrealistic technologies with real science. Does it cheat or include some crazy stuff? Yes but it cheats in science fictiony ways as in it ignores details that are commonly ignored in science fiction. Does it always succeed in making things plausible? No but I would say that its the spirit of the attempt that counts. Implausible science fiction isnt not science fiction its just badly researched or very imaginative science fiction. If Biowares designers find that their ship designs dont make much sense for some science reasons they try to find a compromise. If Star Wars finds that I doubt the Star Wars guys even check. Which is okay because their priority is looking incredibly badass and theyre arguably the best in the world at it.,masseffect,dd2kltp,1,t5_2rc19

The fate of the galaxy you just tried so hard to save is in your hands. So what if theres not a big boss scene or whatever. I personally think the ending still makes you feel that weight especially with the extended DLC. And even if you absolutely hate the ending it would be stupid if it ruined the entire game for you.  The choices you make in ME feel like they really have consequences. Youre gonna lose people sometimes because thats just the reality of war. Entire civilizations turn to you to either save them or let them die all in the interests of putting the fate of the galaxy over the fate of a single race. This game is very good. There isnt a single playthrough Ive done where it doesnt haunt me for days after and I have done plenty of playthroughs. Dont worry about the ending give the game a chance.

And basically once youve established believably that the villain in the story is immeasurably more intelligent than anything in the galaxy and that their motivations are literally so complex and grand that an organic cannot fathom them youve kind of screwed yourself from a storytelling perspective because then how in the hell do you then write some motivations for the antagonists that a large audience will be able to readily grasp without a lot of reflection so the story can continue but that are also clever enough that the audience does find those motivations to be erudite enough that the Reapers initial dismissal of organic intelligence not to be almost completely unfounded and make those intelligent and logical motivations still something that the audience doesnt agree with so they dont feel like theyve been railroaded into continuing to fight against the Reapers even if they agree with what they are doing? Recall how shitty that scene in ME felt when TIM tells you that you had better not let your crew know that he set a trap for them and put them in danger and it cuts to the metting room on the Normandy where Jacob implies you went along with what TIM said not even giving you the option to disagree with thr necessity of his actions.The only way I can personally see that the Reapers motivations could have been handled well was to have handled them in a Lovecraftian horror Elder God way and not ever fully explain it. Even if they were somehow beaten back or killed the reason for their actions should have been left a mystery which would also have left the door open for an even bigger crisis against which the Reapers may have been preparing without specifically detailing what that threat was. As soon as you explain it all in plain English for the player it just makes you think that the Reapers arent that intelligent or incomprehensible theyre just shitty at explaining things and narcissistic. ,masseffect,dduoqm6,1,t5_2rc19

The destroyer class is the same type as the one destroyed on Rannoch by concentrated fire from Quarian ships. What makes me wonder are the Thanix cannons which are IIRC a reverse engineered Reaper tech that allows even a frigate sized ship to punch holes into a collector ship. Besides that in ME when Shepard was lured into a trap and Normandy was in a perfect position to kill the collector ship which it for some reason didnt I wonder that if there was such tech why werent other ships upgraded with it. It wasnt even made by Cerberus as it came from the Turians so I dont really see a reason why it wasnt implemented at the very least on Turian ships. And if they could build the Crucible in such a record time then they surely could mass produce these babies at least before they started diverting resources to building the Crucible. ,masseffect,ddwrku6,6,t5_2rc19

There were small enhancements done here and there but all of the races technological level is pretty much the same ever since their discovery of FTL travel. Simply put Salarians during the time period of Mass Effect are not so much more advanced than the Salarians during the time period of when they created the Citadel Council with the Asari.This can be seen with the First Contact War. The Turians joined the galactic community over  years before humans even discovered FTL travel. Though when the conflict began humans were able to withstand the turian military.That being said  years wouldnt put the AI in much disadvantage due to time.In case of how advanced the Andromeda races are? We dont know much. Would not having the Reapers made them much more advanced? This may not be the case. Milky Way races were able to advance fast only due to the remains of data of species from past cycles I believe Protheans also found data cache that led to FTL. We do not know how long it took for FTL to be developed for the first race.

10852329,0,t3_5v55hb,I think theres still a possibility somewhere down the line that we might get a Mass Effect . There are still stories to be told in the Milky Way. Cerberus didnt disappear just because the Illusive Man is gone. There are Council and nonCouncil races stranded on all the main planets until such time as the relay network is up and running again and theyd be silly to not try to get it working. Aria Tloak isnt a hero and without a Reaper threat to force her to help out Citadel space shes likely to return to piracy and illicit activities including the three mercenary bands she now controls. Who takes over the Normandy with both Shepard amp Anderson dead? Most likely Kaiden or Ashley whoever canonically survived. What about the likely surge in AI research now that EDI has proven her worth and now that the Geth are a sovereign species sharing space with the quarians?An entire closing out the original series properly game could be made just reconnecting relays amp dealing with remaining threats to get the galaxy on a moreorless even keel again. This said I agree that MEA is a soft reboot. But its still Mass Effect and it needs to have those aesthetic amp technological touchstones. But they have wiggle room to do new stuff.

10908742,0,t3_5vv1ft,the three power setup was taken from ME MP not from consoles. If you look at the trailers the button assignment on consoles is L for powers  R for power  and both together for power . If it were designed only around console controller design wed only have two powers at a time. Plus the favorites are a lot quicker to swap on PC than console thanks to hotkeys. And there is a delay to reconfiguring all skills go on cooldown when swapping. In ME and  you also had three separate cooldowns  one for each party member.Of course consoles require devs to work with more limitations. But limitations are not always a bad thing. They force you to think about what the really important things are. Refine the whole system make it flow better. So not necessarily a bad thing. I dont want all keys on my keyboard assigned just because its possible. I want to play a game not type an essay.

10971890,0,t3_5wm9cd,Part of it might be the role the salarian governments played in ME.Most of the salarians you see in ME or ME are males usually STG agents or Spectres. Theyre smart effective in combat and usually on your side but theyre not in charge. The one exception is Counselor Valern who is admittedly a pretty reasonable individual.But then in ME you meet your first dalatrass Linron whos an arrogant entitled bigoted obstructive bureaucrat with almost no redeeming features. Then when you visit SurKesh you discover that the STG is keeping yahg in cages and preparing to uplift them as a possible weapon. Its not a good look for them. Theyre not exactly set up as villains but theyre certainly ambivalent.My guess is that in MEA the salarians we see will be more congenial if only because like everyone else theyre cut off from their homeworlds and their home society.

I think the favorites system can work decently and it does add some tactical choices about how you spec yourself.

When EA heard they wanted another  months they told them no.  It was released  months later once the ending they were working on was ripped out and replaced with the levels you saw in the last couple of parts of the mission along with some modified cinematics etc.  The only thing that remained of the original ending were some voice files accidentally left behind which is how we know the original ending included giving orders to geth primes on the ground on Earth as part of the end mission.

It basically helped me find my passion and career. I have to credit it for that.But despite my love for the franchise I was so terribly pessimistic and skeptical about Andromeda. I felt it was best to not create a new game not because I found Mass Effect  disappointing or because DAI had its problems but because I felt it was the end of a story.

Videogames arent viewed in the same way as other products where you just buy what you want. No when you purchase a videogame these people see it more like voting with your wallet. Its like everything is centered around trying to influence game development studios. Its crazy. These people dont understand how the market mechanism works they dont understand that there are different demographics ie. not everyone wants the same thing and they dont understand that development studios have more sophisticated and effective means of gathering feedback than just lets read some YouTube comments. These people actually think they are some kind of heroes who are saving the game industry and its just completely delusional.It is important to inform yourself about a product before you purchase it but these people take it to an extreme.

As for the Suicide Mission  yes I think it would be appropriate if the characters looked a little bit more readyforbattle.

I view the entire sequence as being a desperate last attempt by the intelligence behind the Repears to manipulate you into doing their bidding.I also pretend that none of the damage done in the destroy ending is irreversible EDI and the Geth because anything else is a cruel disregard for the character development regarding those charactersraces.Shepard survives and reunites with hisher beau to raise lots of adorable babies with them.I tolerate the extended cut ending because I dont think all that highly of the ME story up to that point to begin with. Most things dealing with the Reapers are pretty good but the resources and reach of Cerberus beggar belief. The focus on them as your opponent while the galaxy is dying just doesnt sit right with me to begin with from a storytelling perspective. I dont feel that the ending is too disjointed because not everything is sunshine and roses up to that point.I love the trilogy in many ways from a gameplay character relationship and storytelling perspective but it is far from perfect so I can settle for an imperfect ending with some headcanon amendments.Fanfiction can help too if youre into that.,masseffect,depc1xz,2,t5_2rc19

Because just from playing the game I never got the impression that they were only straight if I was the opposite sex or only gay if I was the same sex as them. Considering Anders and Isabela respective sexual histories theyre clearly bisexual. Fenris will hook up with Isabela regardless of what gender your Hawke is and has history of being involved with a man before. Then Merrill... its easy to see her as playersexual but its also easy enough to believe that only Hawke has ever caught her attention similar to Liara and Shepard.       To me the four of them are bisexual and I thought the devs trying to erase that by clarifying that they were playersexual was done in poor taste. But often I see the people who complain about this use the word bisexual instead of playersexual anyway. So I despise the conflation of the two words on top of everything else.,masseffect,depxvkf,1,t5_2rc19

11100811,0,t1_deq3kyu,Thats a bit of a strawman argument isnt it? If I really wanted to just sleep with all the characters Id just have to play the game a second time with a different gender. Thats not the point here. Character individuality is an interesting idea but what is it exactly? You cant quantify it so saying that protecting it at the expense of something else is just a matter of opinion. It doesnt make a lot of sense why you should be able to romance other alien races at all so I wonder why the line is drawn at gender but not at species? The devs said they added a Garrus romance because the fans really wanted it. How is that not sacrificing a characters individuality? But no one questions it. Similarly there are many gameplay elements that break player immersion all the time. Why are some sacred cows but others are not?Im trying to be thoughtful about this not just complain because I have some preconceived idea of what something should be.

Which implies that generally the Initiative doesnt want conflict. There is also line of dialogue from the Golden Worlds briefing trailer that suggests the Initiative should be respectful of another cultures sovereign soil.I think APEX are supposed to represent the best of the Initiatives military personnel Strike teams and the like where as the rest are likely security and logistics personnel.

11139660,0,t1_deu5rco,Horizon zero dawn is a great game. But idk if its just my bottled up hate for pc culture or something else but the diversity in hzd feels forced. The males in the game are either an asshole or weak or are in need of help dude in distress.However i understand that everyone at some point should be represented in games. We do have plenty of male centered games. In the end the creators should just make the games they want to make and how they want to make them. The best way to diversify is to have a diverse group of people making games.,masseffect,deuo3po,5,t5_2rc19
11140378,0,t1_deuj96n,I really ended up liking Kaidan a lot by the end of the trilogy. A lot of people cant seem to get over his scene on Horizon in ME but that scene was what really started turning him around from kinda bland to something more in my eyes. In that moment hes emotional and sticking to his integrity by not wanting to work for Cerberus even if its a team led by his former commander for a seemingly good cause. I liked that if you keep talking and giving him chances in ME he comes around and apologizes for not trusting you. Ive seen some playthroughs where people never let Kaidan get that far or just shoot him on the Citadel and go the rest of the game assuming hes a dick and that makes me sad.I let Ashley die on Virmire for a rather petty reason she started calling me skipper out of nowhere. I also shut down James loco immediately. Thats Commander to you.,masseffect,deur14w,18,t5_2rc19

11142708,0,t1_deud6pn,Im sitting in on my girlfriends playthrough of the series for her very first time. She loves Mordin. She fucked up her Suicide Mission run in ME to where Mordin did not make it and she just could not bear to live with her mistakes and continue on without him. She had to reset and do right by Mordin because she just loved his character so much.Come the time of Tuchanka mission in ME she was sad to see Mordin leave the group but understood how much his sense of duty and need for redemption meant to him. But when it came time to see Thane and that prayer she could not hold it together.

But despite that ME is a different ballgame the AI in ME and ME were... less than useful. ME bridged the gap but half of that is because if you gave any of them the Typhoon or Prothean Rifle it was a massacre. In ME thus far for me personally anyway Squadmates have either been mostly just Dialogue Fodder in missions or detonators later on.

11169085,0,t1_dexyvhj,XP has always been shared because anything else ultimately would be broken. It still shows what everyones score is so you have that friendly competition of seeing who gets the higher score.Issue is certain classes and setups tend to be more oriented towards getting more points since it doesnt share the individual scores. So for instance say im playing a Krogan and im down in the shit keeping stuff from getting up to the sniper. Ill get my share of kills but the sniper will ultimately be taking a lot of the ones Id be getting with out em there. Which will result in the Sniper coming off as having a far higher score then others.Plus you have support roles that make a huge difference but score shows small since they dont get nearly as many kills as the rest. Especially in ME when you had a singular global CD and you often had a few people setting up stuff with only  guy detonating stuff and getting all the points.So yeah XP is shared because otherwise it would be extremely broken and certain classes would barely level up.

I already tried to make that correspond but that changes too much between the different times we see the menu in those demos. Also it may be the non allocated skill points because why would you display the total numbers of points put in skills here.And  points seems low since apparently you can have all maxed out which is  points apparently at level . So around  points per level calculations from another comment. IGN just posted a video showing soldier profile gameplay and at one point the player level up and that writes  points in that same place than in your screenshot. So who to believe now  ?

One isnt objectively worse than the other and most of it comes down to personal taste. I know it annoys some but it doesnt bother me too much for example.

There were definitely things I would have changed about it but there was so much in that game that I found fresh and different from any other game I have played.  They have a brilliant concoction of narrative and gameplay that most games simply never aspire to implement.  I wont deny that Bioware has changed over time and probably for the worst but it still maintains an identity of its own.

Here the animations are hit or miss Ive seen clips were Ryder displays a wide variety of expressions and othertimes she has absolutely no facial movement iirc there is an early scene where she is speaking about her fathers death and she displays ZERO emotion.

11197154,0,t1_df16dkc,That was poorly worded on my part let me clarifyThe textures are excellent and the environments are gorgeous. However the animations are inconsistent. By that I mean some characters look like they landed right in the middle of the uncanny valley and others move extremely well. Some of the scaling seems weird. The facial animations are particularly unsettling in one or two cases but for the more major characters Ryder PB etc the animations are acceptable or even good.This could lead to immersion issues for some. I did not intend my comment to come off as cynical as it seemed since everyone places emphasis on different things for immersion. For me graphics are only moderately important a great story can overcome nearly any graphical deficit for me.I am running the game on near max on a  ultra wide monitor. I have a Titan XP over a  year old k  . ghz. ,masseffect,df16mqw,3,t5_2rc19

Thus why I think the graphics isnt the issue here its either some other more fundamental problem with the game or.. And I really mean no offense maybe you are just spoiled.Of course the animations and graphics look bad I completely agree with that and maybe its even bad enough that the game isnt enjoyable but I do not see the correlation between animationsgraphics and the ability to empathise with a character that has always been decided by writing in the past whether graphics are good or bad.,masseffect,df1nnsc,0,t5_2rc19

11215686,0,t3_6027rj,The problem with the internet the most extrem voices are the loudest. Thats true for both sides fans and haters.But i must say that many design decisions from Bioware under EA make me kinda angry. The DayOne DLCs cut from the games the preorder items the multiplayer just set up for the real money shop and the focus on MOO gameplay and generic content to fit in with the weak multiplayer as a filler to write hours of gameplay in the advertising.I feel like the core game the storydrivenrpg more and more becomes an empty husk which is just barely there anymore.It just exists to justify the ingame shop the microtransactions and the DLC. It doesnt feel as if Bioware wants to tell us great stories anymore making money in the process  it feels like Bioware wants to sqeeze money out of the player  not matter what they have to do to the games to do so.So i dont hate Mass Effect but i more and more hate what they are doing to the franchise i love just because EA is a bunch of greedy farts rather than people who want to make art in form of great games.If people disagree with me i ask you to look at the Hinterlands quest in DAI or the faces in MEA and tell me  would a mod designer who creates content because he loves the game provide content like this with a Biowarelike budget?. I feel its pretty obvious that Bioware isnt a place where people love the games they create anymore  otherwise they would put more effort into them.,masseffect,df3a90v,6,t5_2rc19

11217049,0,t1_df38wfl,Im not joking.  There are really weird animations through the trilogy.  As there are in the parts of Andromda weve seen.How did that Garrus bug happen?  An animator made some change to improve something that caused weirdness and they didnt have time to fix it before release.How did the clown makeup bug happen?  Some character artist layered the makeup in another setting where it looked fine and didnt get a chance to loop back and fix it before the trial.They are extremely analogous and unfortunately the consequence of having specialization.  No doubt the team making the cinematics in ME pointed out that bug maybe even sent them an email about it but they didnt have the ability to fix it themselves.Same with Addison.  Obviously whoever actually dropped that character model into the Nexus saw what happened under that lighting and maybe even sent an email but they had to do the best they could with what they had.  Is possible thats why she has such bad animations.  Whoever was working on her scenes saw how much work needed to be done to the textures and figured theyd finish tweaking it when the clown makeup had been fixed.

You wouldnt buy an unfinished fridge TV food etc... would you?  At least in Europe they have consumer rights for video games.  I went back and check out Youtube video of Inquisition CC and I forgot how much more advance it is compare to Andromeda.  Not even in the same ballpark.  It all about money for BiowareEA.  They even lie about how CC determine what Alex Ryder will look like.  That is only partially true.  Alex Ryder look different base on already predetermine preset.  By marketing Alex Ryder changing look EA will make more money than just copying Inquisition CC which is using the exact same engine.  By half lying and limiting the CC EA will end up making more money because off their advertising!  Nothing surprise me anymore.  What more can be said?

I do appreciate the presets being different races I can finally make a decent looking Asian protagonist! Im so pleased! but we should be allowed to mix and create whatever we want. Personally I have pale skin as an Asian man and most of the skin tones in the CC even the lightest option is a couple shades darker than me.  Its just such a step backward considering DAIs loaded CC.

Ive no doubt that you have put a great deal of effort into it and I may in fact agree with you throughout. The problem is that there are so many impressionsreviewswhat I think posts and articles that it is sensory overload for me and there is an incredible amount of duplication between them. Lets face it  gaming articles are written either honestly for clicks or a little of both so duplication is expected. I think it is important to read more than one but dozens is a bit much. Sorry about that.Even so Id like to comment that I too am an original trilogy fan with thousands of hours dedicated to the game. I love ME MP too. Played that alone for over  hours. So I can relate to having an opinion that is heavily driven by that experience. Im far from overly critical of Andromeda but likewise Im quite aware of its failings at this point. I certainly agree that this is a different game than the originals. It seems aimed at a younger audience mainly due to the writing although Im not sure if that works or not.Anyway I wont feel bad at all if you dont read my little wall of text.

11224070,0,t1_df46v7m,Thats up to each person to decide. Personally I find their options WELL worth numerous essaylength open letters. I too have played dozens of RPGs with character creators some worse than MEAs but many of them better. The ones that were worse tended to be ones where it didnt matter as much because you rarely saw your own character in closeup they were mostly just three inch tall figures moving around on the screen and in those cases the default options tended to be way better than the defaults in this game anyway. Ive also seen games with WAY better character customization options offering over a dozen sliders for controlling the eyes alone  for the nose six for the cheeks another  for the chin and jaw etc. And it isnt even necessarily the number of sliders the quality matters too. You could offer only one nose slider for example and it would work out if it gave a wide selection of completely different looking noses to choose from. Instead in this engine were left with only resizing and positioning the nose with a fixed shape. They could have done much better. They chose not to. We are letting them know that as customers we do not find this acceptable. ,masseffect,df48g8o,1,t5_2rc19

I think the combat dispute is between action gamers and RPG fans. For people liking stuff like Gears of War  like me the more fluid combat is a huge improvement over the stale and slow combat of ME and  while for RPG fans the lack of party control and inability to pause makes it much worse than its predecessors.

If they suddenly released a Star Wars movie with a fatalist ultra gritty Jarhead like tone people would rightly say they were abandoning part of what made Star Wars Star Wars.  If they did a prequel to The Witcher  years back where the world is generally okay place and you fight alongside the clearly good elves versus the clearly evil humans people would rightly say that they set aside part of what defined that IP.  That doesnt mean that ME needs to be a long series of hyper dark lovecraftian horror stories but its certainly going to feel jarring and less Mass Effect if they tone down the maturity.  ,masseffect,df6jm59,8,t5_2rc19

11246386,0,t1_df6epuc,Remember Max Paynes I just shit my pants face? I loved that game.When I played the MEA trial I giggled my way through certain parts of it. I could definitely see the bizarre the ugly and the downright silly. I still loved playing it.Would I have preferred if it was the best looking game Ive ever played? Of course I would have.The problem is that every year we expect bigger and better games. Yet we still want it to cost the same. Very few industries have this expectation put on it.Im in the group thats okay with some bugs and some weirdness in exchange for  hours of gameplay. I would prefer this over a  hour game that looks like the heavenly genitals of angels.Games like The Witcher  set a precedent among gamers for what they expect out of open world games. They dont really consider that things may be different concerning labor laws dictating how they can be treated in the work place how many choices those employees have or how they can be driven like underfed nags under the whip of an unempathetic master.Or look at Rockstar games where their company has an environment of be perfect or be dead. Theyve set up a no complaints mentality in that company where youll take what you get and like it. They call crunch time The death march.Surprise surprise. Bioware has a high satisfaction rate from employees. Could this be that theyve had realistic expectations put upon them while theyre still allowed to feel human?I cant say definitively this is what happened but Id put money down on the bet that its a factor.The point is something has to give. Whether its animations quests gameplay time scope or graphics. It cant all be bigger and better. Looks to me like they picked their priorities and not everyone is going to agree on what should be prioritized in a game like this.EDIT I will say that I find the writing to be of a lower quality than the first game.

11255233,0,t1_df6m893,I respect that opinion highly and particularly the perspective its coming from but I really couldnt disagree more. We dont need games to be inclusive and Im not at all interested in anything approaching a diversity quota but that is eventually what your argument devolves into. The question stops being Is this game fun? and becomes does this game reflect the complex realities of human sexuality in an adequate way that accommodates the desires of the player character realistically?.There are two competing points here that are both true independent of one another Characters can be complex outside their sexuality and making all characters bisexual or playersexual doesnt have to make them less complex. If the game instead relied upon genderneutral relationships just remove any specific pronouns or references to Scott or Sara in the most recent case it would make it far easier to flesh out other aspects of the relationship system. Imagine an entirely different Mass Effect in which the possibility for romance with any member of your crew was available for any character but the different crew members had radically different levels of difficulty to romance based on the player characters personality what decisions the PC had made in the game and the squadmateNPCs own personal backstory. Been a loner sniping at mercs all alone in a desolate mining colony? You should be way more difficult to romance than some rando on the street because you definitely have major trust issues. Is another character a really open minded whimsical rogue who specializes in stealing artifacts and has recently been helped by the player character by resolving a personal issue and coming to terms with the death of her former partner? Thats an express ticket to pound town baby.Also I guess you could be in love or whatever sThe point here is that I see the unrealistic and lazy part of the romances as the part where you have to do about the same number of things in the same way selecting a fucking romance button for gods sake to romance a character not actually earn it through personal charisma or learning about the character themselves. Id love to see side missions trying to find your love interests favorite things and surprising them with it somehow. That alone would humanize an otherwise robotic process.And who the hell decided that only the player character could romance anyone? If genderneutral responses existed those lines could be repurposed for intersquad romances that would develop automatically if the PC didnt show interest. Tali x Garrus should absolutely have been a thing when I went MaleShep x Kaidan.Sorry for the wall of text and I appreciate your thoughtful comment in the first place!,masseffect,df7ri4k,2,t5_2rc19

11257254,0,t1_df7z47a,I do agree that Bioware Montreal has never shipped a full game before. But I dont agree that its necessarily the reason for the flaws in the game. Regarding the amount of people who previously worked on ME I gave the percentage but the value is interesting too. Its  people versus  for ME but the team is twice the size. And one important point is that the leads and directors mostly have experience with ME. Talking about the experience of a studio as a whole is not necessarily meaningful. Its more relevant to the public image of the studio. But a studio can have a high rate of turnover meaning that the teams working on different games are not consistent. If you take ME approx same size as for ME but half the team changed.As for the game engine usually each studio develop its own set of tools. For exemple a studio working with UE or Unity will most likely develop its own tools for its production pipeline. Also this pipeline might not be the same as other EA games. There is some info with sources about that on wikipedia,masseffect,df7zr13,-11,t5_2rc19
11257259,0,t3_60nyxc,I believe it should be neither. Firstly because ME is our story and the whole point of the game is to configure the story to your own personal liking and decisions. Every choice is canon at the same time so sticking to one story line would effectively be the most unMass Effect thing to do.   And secondly because they would probably fuck it up. Ive seen too many beloved franchises be ripped to miserable shreds already. If they get the plot right the production design will be for shit andor viceversa. I am already anticipating that Ghost in the Shell will be a once again huge disappointment in that regard.  ,masseffect,df7zrrk,57,t5_2rc19

11257767,0,t1_df81bi2,Aye we do. But Bioware are known for their romances and great characters. Its only fair for people to hope and want for representation when theyve done a good job of it in a previous game DAI. And finally getting Kaiden in ME has only added salt to the wound of having no mm squad mate romance this time around. Feels like a step back. Add to that the datamined bi flags for Jaal and the Twitter teasinghints and mistakes and people are definitely going to be complaining strongly about Jaal specifically. But yes there will always be complaints. DAI had people complaining about the romances for a straight male because Cass was too butch and Josie was the only other option for them which a lot of people didnt like. Personally as long as there is a fully fleshed out proper romance for each sexualitygender then Id not complain. I may not like the only gay person available... but thats just like real life. Having no option at all just hurts. But agreed on Fanfiction theres mods too. ,masseffect,df81udi,2,t5_2rc19

11267148,0,t1_df8kpvg,You need to look at the context. Everything he listed and everything you listed is hard science fiction in the sense that it requires just a little fiction in terms of writing not technological or scientific proportions as in Alcubierre drives requiring the so called exotic particle to work and while its a small step on fictional paper its an obstacle we will probably never be able to overcome in terms of tech and science and he writers have gone to great lenghts to give all of it some context and base within that universe.Cue space ninjas. Which is style over substance. A lot of things in ME went towards a more traditional sci fi route in that regard. MEA went even further unimaginably further.,masseffect,df9450b,1,t5_2rc19
11267302,0,t1_df93g94,Only that Shepard had a mom if you chose to or was an orphan if you chose to etc. He could be space James Bond if you chose to or nurture a deep relationship with Liara over  games if you chose to. He had Anderson as his mentor and Joker as his sidekick since before ME. What made Shepard special was PRECISELY that he wasnt a faceless personification for you but that he was YOUR SHEPARD. A mix of a person real enough and empty enough for you to mold and identify with but also admiredespise. ,masseffect,df94rl4,44,t5_2rc19
11267465,0,t1_df94y87,I understand your point and agree with it somewhat. But at the same time these games that do have bugs and glitches are being reviewed in that state surely people have to review what theyre playing and not be thinking oh its ok because this will probably be patched.Personally I think the hate is getting way out of control and is probably being fueled by people not even playing it. Its getting to the point where games journalist sites are making stupid click bait videos about weird animations it all feels pretty low ball and like theyre just trying to grab a piece of the action so to speak. I watched my friend playing BoTW wild for a while the other day and the frame rate was horrible but to me it feels like people have glossed over it. Im not saying MEA is better or anything like that and I think BoTW looks like an awesome game but it just feels like one rule for one and another for the other sometimes. Basically it feels like people were ready to tear down ME before it even got out of the gates and were just waiting for any little thing to focus on and thats exactly what has happened.,masseffect,df95fh5,8,t5_2rc19

Because I do not get that reaction after actually playing the game. I certainly get those reactions from looking at curated screenshot comparisons on this sub like you provided but having played the game has changed my view on the debate around MEA much like OP.Also you spend time justifying comparisons to older ME games but than you post a picture of a Ryder with less than flattering graphics settings on compared to a character from a completely different game especially one that is now a gold standard for character animation.,masseffect,df99x6p,12,t5_2rc19

11270179,0,t3_60oz4k,Allow me to highlight the what could reasonably be conceived as points in every part of this excruciatingly dumb postgt I was extremely disappointed when I learned that reviews of Mass Effect Andromeda are unfortunately averaging out into the s rangeThis number tells me that the game is reasonably good instead of absolutely fucking  great. This means its bad.gt Its out and no way in hell am I going to buy it ... due to these average to mediocre reviews.I have no opinion of my own and rely on numbers and scores to make my decisions for me.gt Many of you are in denial. Youre telling people Dont read the reviews or the reviews were wrong!Telling people that one personally enjoys the game despite the average review scores is automatically telling everyone that the reviews are wrong because subjectivity doesnt exist and a game can only be objectively good or bad.gt Could you imagine buying a car or a house without reading up on it first?I nonironically and with a straight face seriously just compared buying a video game to buying a house or car.Besides using your dumb example to make a counterpoint could you imagine buying a car or a house without driving or visiting it first?gt For example how many of you were burned by grabbing Destiny on day one back in  only to play it and be massively disappointingThose who bought Destiny despite the reviews and enjoyed it are objectively wrong because I think its a bad game.gt I dont care if Biowares name is on the box. With reviews like these the Bioware name now means nothing to me.I have no opinion of my own and rely on numbers and scores to make my decisions for me.gt Were not talking about a single review were talking about an average of ALL reviews here. is a terrible aggregate review score.gt They all say the game is a disappointment.This this this this and this review doesnt exist.gt If you have money to spare and lots of free time to blow then by all means go ahead and buy this disappointment.Ive just spent the entire post telling everyone not to buy the game. Also if you want go ahead and buy the game.gt Im not upset at anyone playing Andromeda but if youre telling people to ignore the reviews on behalf of sane gamers shove it.Im not mad at people who enjoy the game but fuck you.You are an entirely different kind of stupid one that say an intergalactic exploration initiative might discover among the lifeforms in a new galaxy.

Example  Witcher  came out well before ME  and it looked leaps and bounds better than ME . Same type of comparison now. I am no code junky or dev. But perhaps it is due to the engine of the game.  Or some other factor. Be that as it may it still stands that ME games have never had the best facial animations. I think that saying MEA looks worse than ME is a bit extreme. It doesnt.

11272953,0,t3_60tr2v,I for one hope that genuine disappointment isnt just downvoted for the sake of curating a community of people who love MEA unconditionally. Theres a big difference between people who have the knives out for this game and people like me who are going to wait this one out in genuine disappointment until patches DLC and discounts come our way. Of course it helps if everyone contributes a new thought that pushes us forward. Its very difficult to have refined critical opinions whether positive or negative so early in the games release. Both initial takes were fast and reactionary as is typically the case on the internet because we deal in extremes. This community will heal the most when people realize that our opinions on MEA are not at war theyre just opinions and opinions are for discussing not debating. ,masseffect,df9rtwd,19,t5_2rc19

On the other hand I find myself curious what others experiences are not to inform my own because Im honestly just too stubborn amp individualistic to let others impact my perspectives but just out of a sense of idle curiosity about what others are taking from the experience.I noted some odd facial animations and I hold out hope that well get a Black Emporiumstyle addon for this game I couldnt make a humanlooking Sara in the CC no matter how much I tried this is my failing not BioWares so I can change my Sara I went with her default appearance without having to restart the game.

I was not told why there is a delay from launch though I suspect its a bottomline matter it encourages more people to shell out for the fullprice DeluxeSuperDeluxe versions which are much harder to obtain outside of Origin directly whereas the standard edition can be had at pretty decent discounts from several sources  a bargain hunter who then upgrades will likely be able to get the Deluxe edition for less than the list price of the standard.

If you level Annihilation to give you shields for enemies that die in range and get the range upgrade on it youll get back shields for killing enemies with Lance. Itll help you spam that ability even more.I take Cora with me a lot for her Shield recharging ability too.

Cause if all they hear is something it could be VERY easily a bad something that totally misrepresents the issue. You dont just scream the loudest and not worry about how something comes across. Thats only going to isolate people and make them think a legitimate issue isnt worth taking seriously Believe me Im not happy about this at all but I dont think this is the way to approach it. ,masseffect,dfap25k,1,t5_2rc19

After you defeat Archon you see a Kett leader on a ship looking menacingly at the camera after being told its not over yet. Then you can check logs at the after party and find out that the Turian Ark made it and sent out a distress beacon. Except its not a beacon its a warning to keep away. What in gods name is bad enough for them to forsake rescue and tell us to stay away? The sequel baddies.

11292115,0,t1_dfbxbkw,Not sure I get what you mean. If you are comparing the dev team behind Witcher and the dev team behind MEA as the cook and restaurant respectively... its like a time constraint. The Witcher team might have had more time to go at their own pace with their publisher not running them ragged. To keep with my analogy its the difference between asking a cook to make an amazing meal for me sometime when they get around to it within reason no one will wait  years for a game but an extra mo  years isnt really overkill. EAthe restaurant is more like we need a  course meal with appetizers and dessert and we need it ASAP.gt So why did the cook with significantly less staff prepare more food and better food then the well funded restaurant?Simply put the time the cooks were allowed was different.You could also think of it like school. Not intending to compare dev teams with grades but using grades to make a point here... If an A student only gets  hours to write a  page essay they might get a lower grade than a B student that gets  days to write a  page essay would just because the lower GPA student could go at a rate of  page per day allowing more time to look for errors and mistakes whereas the higher GPA student has  times as much to go over in a day to look for errors and mistakes.,masseffect,dfby16f,2,t5_2rc19

11293908,0,t1_dfbuts3,Honestly I really liked the first few hours into the game though that ice world ended up getting on my nerves with its repetitive and boring side quests but the game just got MUCH MUCH more interesting after advancing the main quest which opened up way more stuff to do and way cooler environments. Another thing I really love is how much more Ryder can be like you. I could be wrong but I feel like the way you act in conversations and the choices you make affect Ryders personality which affects how they talk. For example at the start of the game Ryders dialogue is pretty neutral but after the time I put in hours I believe and around  completion these interactions with squadmates and the dialogue you have no control over have turned to be really casual since thats how I act most of the time. It also gives a psych eval of Ryder in the codex and reading it just fits me to a T considering I always made choices based on what I would have chose in that situation.Sure the animations are sometimes bad but at this point all I hope is that they learned from their mistake and that the next game will be even better than this one.,masseffect,dfc5cmf,15,t5_2rc19
11294014,0,t1_dfbqncg,The differences in the jaw and chin probably only look different as a result of one opening her mouth and the other closing it. Even so small differences like that would still be negligible since the shapes of their faces are still the same. Of course in practice you can tell them apart because of their colors but its a distinct leap back from the variation they had in previous installments as several people have mentioned which is a shame. Its not like with turians krogans and salarians where the lack of recognizable facial variation could be explained by humans not recognizing those nonhuman features as well although implementing that at some point would be supersweet.,masseffect,dfc5s6q,1,t5_2rc19

11298952,0,t1_dfcpkp5,According to Electronic Arts fiscal  third quarter earnings report Dragon Age Inquisition sold the most units of any game in BioWare history. So clearly the game was embraced beyond Dragon Age fans. And critics gave it an average  score  and critics arent sorely Dragon Age fans. Thats a good score.gtYou just need to go to the internet on different forums to see it its hardly a minority.This is a really bad way to extrapolate information about how a game is played or received by the wider public. People who participate in gaming forums are a tiny minority of gamers  and often the most vocal and outspoken. Hell generally only about  of people who lurk on forums are participating in the conversation at high rates with only  ever participating and a huge number of gamers never go near a forum in the first place.

Theres nothing unique to stumble across because you were out exploring.Like the absolute biggest strength of an openworld game is its opportunity for exploration.

11302231,0,t3_61azhx,Easy there champ.First you can only have  active abilities at a time but you can have  profiles available at any time that you can swap to. That means up to  out in the field.Also you have passives. A lot of passives. Take a look at the teamwork stuff in tech and the shield recharge passives. Sounds pretty good for lance spamming biotic doesnt it? Theres also a  reduced carry weight passive. This also gives access to high level sentinel profiles which are far better imo than pure adept. Much tankier. If you are playing on a high difficulty even using nothing but biotics you want these talents and sentinel.Then you have the combat tree. While the actives may not seem useful the passives are fantastic. Maxing out the gun lines is an obvious choice but things like hoverdamage resistancecarry weightholsterstank passives are all very good even on a biotic.Im level ... something and Im nowhere near done and thats with only  abilities I really use across  profiles and zero points in any weapons.,masseffect,dfd3ajv,5,t5_2rc19

Destructoid rated it as . and the break down for that is Slightly above average or simply inoffensive. Fans of the genre should enjoy this game but a fair few will be left unfulfilled. Polygon has it at a . Sevens are good games that may even have some great parts but they also have some big buts.

I think its a huge reason were seeing the bugs quirks and general lack of polish were seeing with Andromeda. Inexperience with the engine hell a pretty inexperienced team in general.  Regardless of my own personal opinion on review scores and the big news sites who give them they do matter. A lot. Higher scores and more general praise helps build or maintain a brand or IP likewise a bad or even average initial impression can wreak havoc on lifetime sales of a game. Its not often a game launches to a poor or lukewarm reception and recovers. EA shouldve delayed and given them more time to work out the kinks. Especially with a new engine. It wouldve been better for sales and the Mass Effect brand.  Instead they made the conscious decision to launch with some serious flaws. I love the game but with some more time in the oven it wouldve been received much much better as a whole. Instead we get the worst scoring Mass Effect ever by a sizeable margin.

So only swinging your sword even with all the melee damage bonuses and health plus shield recharge on my chestpiece I still died with pretty much any weapon the Asari sword worked like super well tho.

11318053,0,t1_dfetd2x,Curiosity. I wanted to know where the story lead to. I have over  hours in the original trilogy. I love Mass Effect. I finished it in under  hours because the sidequests and exploration got old really fast and considering I hated pretty much everyone but Drack and Jaal I didt even bother talking to them or doing their missions. I went straight forward to see if the story got better but it never did. For a player like me who enjoys the story and character development the most when playing a single player game Andromeda is mediocre at best and its bright spots are not enough to clear up the dark ones. I dont regret playing this game but I certainly cannot say I liked it.EDIT Also have you finished the game? Can you honestly tell me that playing Space Janitor Simulator cleaning up planets for other people to live in is an exciting adventure to you?,masseffect,dfevsb0,4,t5_2rc19

Most of the problems you cite with DAI those that are objective issues and not things that may be subjective to players have been improved or ameliorated or fixed entirely in Andromeda. The side content is much better integrated in particular. gt I believe you misunderstood my final line. ME wasnt known for the missions on uncharted planets. It was known for its main missions.A lot of people will cite ME as their favorite because it was the most RPG for reasons that include the exploration and side stuff.

Similarly the Andromeda and Pathfinder Sentinel Chest armour one of which we see as Ryder walks off of the Tempest in a trailer and also in many other trailers the thin sleek looking greyish black armour is non existent in game yet is in the games code like the AAX and the Automatic Fire module... They show it off as a selling point in demos and trailers and then nope we are not allowed to have that because REASONSSome of the great powers from the OT trilogy were just outright removed like the Biotic Warp Lash Flare Slam Reave.

11345389,0,t1_dfhylli,Im going to have to disagree with you a bit when it comes to Shepard and Ryder. Ive only played a little bit of MEA so far and while I agree that Ryder has some good one liners theres something in it that reminds me too much of DAIs Inquisitor. Which is to say theyre fun to play as but didnt feel fully realized and in part had limited dialogue options. Shepard is unique in how we as the players create them whether or not we use the default as a fully realized individual. I tend to view the OT as a sort of interactive movie and one of my favorite things to do is have a Shepard who is almost entirely paragon. Not completely but he tries to do what is right as often as possible. Then towards the end of the third game usually after Thessia he snaps a little and from that point on I start to choose more renegade options. But seeing how similar the dialogue options are now to the ones in DAI while it was a fun game I dont see the same sort of thing happening. So to sum up Shepard is bland by design and thats what makes him unique. Hes a template for the player to build on emotionally in a way that a lot of other games dont provide. ,masseffect,dfhza9d,1,t5_2rc19

While the Krogan did get screwed it wasnt my doing so I dont feel the need to make up for that especially because Morda is an oldguard Krogan that clearly dislikes other races and wants to take as much territory as she can.  She is not an effective ruler given the amount of dissent behind her already and she absolutely could not be trusted with the drive core giving her that especially as SAMs warning reminds us ultimately would be giving Morda not necessarily the Krogan a huge advantage.  I wouldnt put it past her to break the truce with the Nexus and attack whenever she felt like it.  On top of that I as the Pathfinder made their planet habitable found research that may lead to curing the genophage it does in the OT and I also brought back their seed vault and their best botanist without which they absolutely wouldve died.  I think I repaid them for what the Nexus did just by doing those things the drive core is just too much power for Morda.

Tech is focused on passives and a single power.Powers Concussive Shot Energy Drain and Pull Concussive Shot can be upgraded to detonate combos and its knockback acts like a stun against all enemies. Energy Drain can be upgraded to prime enemies in addition to detonating combos while it regens shields. Pull is a primer that lets me disable some combatants for a while by tapping it and letting them float around.Weapons Equalizer Sweeper any sniper and Asari Sword. Equalizer is my close quarters weapon and augmented with shield restore on empty clip damage at  clip and kinetic coils. Modded with clip capacity damage penetration and melee. Sweeper is augmented with shield restore on empty clip damage at  clip and kinetic coils. Modded with clip capacity damage penetration and stability. Sniper is whatever I can make or find.

Asari Sword is a passive weapon so I put Combo Damage andor Power ForceDamage augments on it.Armor Deep Space Explorer Chest Deep Space Explorer HelmetThis is an XP boost armor that doesnt allow addition leg or arm pieces.

In typical interactions you had an investigation tab with  indepth question lines which could involve into more a paragon and renegade and then  other dialog options including a neutral.

In ME  options were further reduced the neutral dialog option was stripped out and investigations were reduced or not possible in most conversations and limited to hubs. In MEA you often cant ask things you would want to dialogs for characters will often not change even half way into the game or near the end auto dialog is much higher than in ME  and it was bad in there and in many times because theyve tried to place two different styles of talk for each convo with the guy being more logical or professional and the girl being more casual and such youll have at most two options.,masseffect,dfkbrzx,2,t5_2rc19

Asari certainly wont have the same interests and those with similar interests gravitate towards each other and feel distant from the other side.

Its still not enough in depth on Citadel races and their affairs for those who are new to the franchise its very high paced and not really in depth even tho theres alot of stuff that could have been introduced as an developemnt of what we still didnt know about them from OT. Like we still dont know how asari seem attractive to all Citadel species...And it definitely wasnt enough new stuff for those who are into OT and didnt need introductions.

I use cora when I dont want to go vanguard since she gets way better with charge later on in the game and liam has overload in case you run into any remnant. I never use vetra or peebee though. Peebee is easily the weakest teammate no matter what. While vetra is not weak a garrus like character with concussion shot has no real effect on the combat.It sucks because I like her but concussion only works well when you can detonate the skill yourself like in the old games.

To make a solid scene you need atleast two of the components to be good be they the VA the script or the director. A good director and VA can make something work with a bad or boring script as can a solid VA with a great script but an inexperienced director. Andromeda seems to suffer from a bad director and a script that flips between boring and comedic which is why the jokes seem to hit most of the time but when a team meeting is called everyone is rigid and monotone.

11375476,0,t1_dfldwvu,The thing is unlike Anderson I actually think Raeka would be best for the role. Being ambassador is part of the Pathfinder job description Ryder and the other Pathfinders would be able to work with her so she can best represent all the Initiative races I dont think she would be manipulated by Tann and I think she is all around trustworthy. I also thought August Bradley was a really good choice but it would look worse to pick a human in my eyes and while he is a good outpost leader I dont know if he is a good ambassador though I think he would be. I just thought picking an Angara would be weird though I think Moshae would be a good choice and I was kind of confused when Morda was a choice.

11375495,0,t1_dfktkjc,I can smell what youre steppin in  and youre certainly right about Mass Effect . That game is so good its not even fair.Given the stakes in Mass Effect  I kind of disagree  the urgency there was definitely appropriate and the main quests had a lot of weight to hammer that point home. The more you fought back the more desperate the situation became and right up till the end it seemed like everything was more or less hopeless. Mass Effect  is what made Shepard herhis own character I thought.Ill probably have more of an opinion on too many quests once I understand the context of the ending amp the main quest a bit more but as it stands I have no problem with too much of a good thing. As far as focus goes I definitely get what youre saying. Im not sure if I should stay on the planet and do some side quests or head back to the ship. At this point Im playing it by ear and it all seems to be working out but having no indication of how long the main quest is Im constantly in fear that Im rushing and missing stuff.,masseffect,dfle5pw,1,t5_2rc19

11381457,0,t3_62eay5,BLUF Ambient music tracks should have covered for lack of Nomad music probably could have if they were unique to each planet.Music in long stretches of gameplay is typically an all or nothing thing. Too few songs and they become grating. Popular example being Fallout NV and having to FUCKING LISTEN TO JOHNNY FUCKING GUITAR EVERY OTHER FIVE FUCKING MINUTES. Or they have to have a decently extensive playlist especially if any actual words are spoken in any the songs.This is why music in Ryders quarters works! Because you typically arent even there long enough for a single song to end or for it to become close to becoming stale.So they would have to have either a playlist that is decently extensive or have a track the flows quite naturally as to not become grating. Which is typically something done with ambient music.Im not saying having music in the Nomad is a bad idea. It could have been pretty easy to implement the same playlist in the Nomad as Ryders quarters. But this would have the side effect of making the music in the quarters more staleless meaningful. There would be some give and take in this situation. Plus I seriously doubt players would be willing to put up with the small selection of tunes that the quarters radio provides after a few hours. Making not only the work to implement it in the Nomad effectively useless while again lowering the value of the music in the quarters.Honestly I think MEAs ambient soundtrack should have been improved to fill this void. Having different ambient tracks for each planet could have been a feature used to give each one even more of a personality. This way songs would also not go stale in between planets like they would on a Nomad radio. Hell if a player liked a planets track more than others it could garner a players emotional attachment to said planet. Even if it is subconscious that is a big deal in shaping the players outlook on the game.Ambient music used to be essential in games where graphics had a hard time depicting separate locations. And while it may no longer be necessary to have music being a huge factor in differentiating places it still should be taken into account for the effect it can have on the player. The way the game handles it now is at best uninspired.I dont know about you guys but not once did I stop to even listen to anything that what was presented by the soundtrack.,masseffect,dfm2hs2,5,t5_2rc19

Cement and polish the head hitboxes on Biotic floated enemies. I have shot through opponents with no registered hit occurring. Streamline the crafting process. I dont honestly know if yall can do this but it is abysmal to slog through. General polish in regards to graphical clipping issues and getting stuck in places I shouldnt get stuck in. This isnt a huge issue but I would like to see it investigated. The Upgrade paths for weaponsarmor. It is costly enough that I only really want to invest in two weapons and one set of armor. If I explore others I run the risk of being too spread out for my resources to handle and then end up doing little to no damage to my enemies.The character creation. Please please fix this somehow.

11384966,0,t3_62ftlg,SAM seems pretty literally inseparable from Ryder at this point. I dont see Bioware making SAM fully turn against you in the future though thats not to say there wont be disagreements while you shape SAMs growth and understanding as potential future events unfurl. SAM seems quite content to be the Pathfinders aid and collect experience data through them as an assistant rather than through a directly controlled robot frame like EDI. However theres plenty of foreshadowing to indicate that other people are going to be less responsible with AIs in Andromeda. Imagine an AI linked to others less interested in the advancement and wellbeing of the galactic community or an AI capable of manipulating several people at once or one that raises an army of machine puppets. I think any AI based antagonism will come mainly from outside forces in any Andromeda sequels leaving SAMRyder to play the heroic example of ManMachine symbiosis done right.What interests me most is the fact that we dont really have any idea of SAMs real capabilities nor the specifics of Ryders integration with it. SAM doesnt behave like an unshackled AI but we know that Ryder Sr improved SAM above and beyond the other Pathfinder AIs. Weve seen that SAM can repair the neural pathways in Ryders brain and both stop and start his heart on command but its not explained how those were achieved. Is it simply a controlled dose of chemicals released from the implant? Is it nanomachines? That seems more likely considering Ryder is supposed to die if disconnected from SAM. Correct me if this information was actually in any of the hidden emailsdatapadsconversations etcId like the nature of the SAMRyder integration to be further explored in the future. It evokes potentially interesting capabilities like the time Shepard interfaced with geth hardware and roamed around in virtual environments. That should be possible with current integration. SAM could probably help improve Ryder to well beyond human capabilities aswell making Ryder stronger faster tougher and smarter although you dont really have to work on increasing the intelligence of the host if theyre connected to a hyperintelligent AI. I see them trying to squeeze SAMs physical hardware onto the Tempest to counteract the vulnerabilities of remotely broadcasting from a far away location with poor defenses.,masseffect,dfmgt38,1,t5_2rc19

It is not just sterilization it is killing the . . .infants? Babys? Inside the womb. From what I understand from Krogan Boasting at least before the Genophage their live births numbered in the hundreds at a time.

11404911,0,t3_62rctx,I cant agree with the overall score.  is exceptionally harsh because MEA at its core is still a decent game but it seems like the authors main gripe with the game is its story and I cant help but agree. It just doesnt feel like the type of writing I expect from a Mass Effect game. Its plainly obvious Bioware wanted to get as far away from the Milky Way and its stories as possible but starting entirely from scratch was a mistake and forced them into story lines that weve already seen anyways. Its not as exciting the second time around. But to make things worse theyve neutered the level of politics and historical conflicts that gave way to the plethora of stories in the Milky Way. Cross species interaction in MEA is far too black and white with no complexity. You know what I loved about the OT? It was that there were rarely any inherently bad villains. SPOILERs Even the reapers had purpose other than pure evil. It feels like the Kett are evil for the sake of being evil with everyone else being unequivocally righteous. There are still moments in the story that are reminiscent of old Bioware writing I love but its an old shadow of what it once was. I get that its a new galaxy with new stories but it feels like in their attempt to escape the OT theyve forced themselves into rehashing the old stories without taking what made them good in the first place.,masseffect,dfoqd87,44,t5_2rc19

11432555,0,t3_636u3y,This is the biggest issue I am having with the game right now.  The entire premise of the game is so completely and utterly internally inconsistent.Backstory and mission spoilers ahead!MEA SPOILERs You enter the Andromeda galaxy about  months after the Nexus arrives.  In those  months the Nexus is unable to get a foothold anywhere but the exiles and the Krogan are both able to set up footholds on their own.  And then theres the Angara.  You supposedly are making first contact  and the Angara on Aya treat it that way.  However the exiles had already taken over an Angaran settlement on Kadara and there are numerous other instances of the Angaran working with or against the exiles.  While its clear from some datapads that some Angaran were aware of the Initiative and observed them remotely it doesnt explain why everyone on Aya treats Ryder landing as a true first contact.  Then theres Dracks loyalty mission.  You go to some moon of Elaaden  nevermind the fact that Elaaden seems to be a moon of a gas giant itself  and find some very old refinery equipment.  How can it be very old?  It would have to be Angaran but then why does it look familiar to Drack?  Theres so many more instances of this and perhaps the biggest one is the numbers problem youve posed in your OP but it really has made me struggle with this game.,masseffect,dfrv9u7,13,t5_2rc19
11432945,0,t3_636t19,Id have been happy to trade a couple of the planets for another  loyalty quest style missions. Open world is nice but it did turn into a bit of a grind after a while because of the painfully slow travelling times back and forwards. A few more exciting onrails style missions would have helped to break up the monotony of scanning picking flowers and doing the monoliths and vaults which were almost identical on every planet.I managed  in about  hours. All I know that I missed was  missions or tasks that wouldnt complete due to bugs  chase the datapad trail style planet tasks because I didnt even remember what planet they were for and I also couldnt bring myself to scan the last  planet systems that appeared on the galaxy map.  minutes of flying animations for look Ive found an anomaly. Its a river! Have some XP I couldnt handle the excitement.Still really liked the game though for all its flaws. Loved my Ryder and her crew.

11445848,0,t1_dfsvr7r,One of the reasons for Asari being so much better is due to evolving to use Eezo due to it being native to their planet.  Protheans did a ton of genetic experimentation on them and were even more advanced than Remnant not to mention their own psionics gave them a baseline to give Asari who then continued to evolve it for k yearsAs for the Rachni I get the feeling they were a genetic bioweapon project from a previous cycle.  The precedent for Biologicallybased dreadnoughts was set in ME with the Batarian arc.  If say...  cycles ago they were created and abandoned when the reapers came its quite possible that they were simply missed due to being nonstandard in terms of what the reapers typically targeted.  They didnt use conventional tech which is the reason reapers left it behind for reverse engineering in the first place to ensure future evolutions would use tech theyre familiar with   so they escaped notice and continued to flourish  evolve well beyond easy reach of any relays.  Something like them evolving is a bit... far fetched but being intentionally created with these capabilities isnt beyond what weve seen invented by other races.  ,masseffect,dftdko8,1,t5_2rc19

I mean while Im in the experience noted above the reality is I dont on an intellectual level think the experiences of some transgender people are wholly representative of all transgender people because theyre people first theyre individuals as different from each other as any other gender identity or presentation.Consequently I dont get the upset. BioWare is of course free to do as they wish with their games but this just seems like a solution looking for a problem. Its one thing if youre playing a gay Shepard or Ryder and only have one viable romance option per gender this is the main protagonist of the story and has an immediate and deep effect on the players immersion.But as it relates to a secondstring NPC on one settlement in a game that features full colonization of five planets and then some!?

And it would have completely shifted the tone of the game toward a desperate regretful lastditch quest for survival one where really difficult decisions like how to make room in a cluster already populated by other species would become plausible.

11469376,1,t3_63pdbf,Idk I feel like the side quests in this game were much better than almost any in either trilogy bioware has released. The game doesnt have more  or less side quests than DAI which is the only other game that was open world...and the side quests in MEA are much better than DAI.The entire purpose of the story is establishing your forces in Andromeda and almost all the side quests contribute to that in one way or another. I dont understand how you didnt feel urgency when almost every situation in the latter half of the story is urgent and almost all the significant side quests are urgent...I mean...literally every single loyalty mission is extremely urgent unless you want them to artificially reinforce this by having them auto fail if you dont decide to do them. Almost all the main planetary missions are urgent if you care at all about the storyline of those planets...I really dont get this urgency thing. As a matter of fact I was slightly annoyed that there was so much content while the latter half of the story is extremely urgent with the archon trying to race you to meridian while there are still dozens of side loyalty missions that are equally time restrictive lore wise.Your opinion is as valid as mine I guess I just disagree.I mean..isnt it possible you just dont give a shit about the story...thats what it seems like to me...the only time you seem happy is when youre getting closer to being done with the game.

11473050,0,t1_dfw50eh,gt It has bothered me ever since.Its because humanoid bodies are easy to animate for us. Thats why you never see any elcor or hanar activity other than them standing and talking.Essentially all of the sentient races have designwise the same skeleton and because of that you can interchangeably use any animation you make for one race on another one. That means less time spent implementing races which means less spent money there which is yay for management and a frownyface for players that expected a universe of beings that were not all samey.,masseffect,dfwgr9q,5,t5_2rc19

It doesnt look like anything weve seen in the standard sci fi tropes.  SR looks like it could have come off the set of any of a dozen sci fi tab shows or books.The SR also looked almost alive when it maneuvered because of those moving central thrusters.

The armor stripe and color scheme are in my headcanon Ryders tribute to their father but wearing the N is like some rando army guy putting a Ranger and Special Forces tab on his uniform without going to any of the schools.I totally get that the N armor is the best biotic armor and think its unfortunate theres not an equal option that doesnt involve that look.

11505808,0,t1_dfx9dyh,I think the biggest thing is the novelty of it. Im a space geek and mass effect  was a huge tease for us. Being able to fly around and land on planets looking for resources was really cool but it got old quick because of there being only  points of interest on any given planet and they all looked exactly the same with reskins. In andromeda you actually have large scale unique and fully exploitable planets that have their own side quests and story quests. And running around you can find little out posts and things to shoot at and loot. I think they coulda made the side quests more interesting but the exploration itself is really cool to me. ,masseffect,dg06mxt,1,t5_2rc19

They need to spark interest in this game.How you would know what  Bioware ever meant to include or not include as far as the Suvi romance ? I hope you arent just using that  to excuse what amounts to inadequate content for Suvis romance.Bioware is going to add additional male romance content for male ryder. Maybe they werent intending to have that in the game originally either but they are  adding it nonetheless.They can add more romantic content for Suvi and femryder if they can ber persuaded to do so.,masseffect,dg07d1j,1,t5_2rc19

11511649,0,t1_dg0ubx6,Well Im trying to think of something you could easily have missed. I did I am certain  exploration in every single area of every single thing. So there is literally nothing I missed unless its a secret access. I found about the other  remnant puzzles so did that and those were somewhat hidden but only the cave really.I cant think of anything too obvious most of the Nexus quests keep giving me starter quest dialog and not progressing their dialog but those are in the log.Never got Remnant Abyssal codex log because it doesnt work for me but no big deal there. Never got Krogan babies either because I guess thats scouts only despite taking out Spender and saving the colonys ome friend I am I guess.Beyond that... cant really think of anything to miss. All exploration galaxy options since if a name is present on the map it means something is there usually unless its a primary world.Got the cultural quest today that makes me go on special ops task on Voeld but had  already at that point plus got movies and shield left over so eh.. cant think of anything.Did you get every Remnant Data Core? All ? Im told theres one in Khi Teresa but unless I got it unknowingly only the Remnant Decryption Puzzle there was what I missed.,masseffect,dg0uiau,1,t5_2rc19

But the only reason I think bioware made them so different is because of the very mission set of andromeda they dont want military primarily the mission is exploration and pioneering. While the military aspect is needed its not a priori like in OT. If youve ever hung out with a bunch of scientists and mountaineers its similar to hanging out amongst the lower ranks in the military with humour sometimes immature toilet humour as well playing an important role in their lifestyle.

11530991,0,t1_dg315zv,Yeah that can be a part of the game where the player is better than the scripting.  It probably would be a little more tense on hardcoreinsanity.

11532337,0,t1_dg36gpy,No morgue humor isnt uncommon at all but theres no indication beyond headcanon that this is whats going on.  Theres no meditations on how tough things are and that the goofing around is what gets them through the day.  This is literally as I described Ryder going out on a mission where he first encounters the exiles killing like  himself and the game offering no reflection on that besides people teasing Ryder about his driving.  The game makes no mention of how Ryder went from a rookie to a God of Death over the course of a couple of weeks nor does it appear to think its an important shift when we move from killing Ketthostile Rhokar to killing our own brain damagedstarving colonists.  Youre welcome to paint it with whatever brush you like but generally theres a word for writing that never explores motivations or reactions beyond the surface.,masseffect,dg36xvo,27,t5_2rc19

11536391,0,t1_dg3d967,Powers do fine damage but they fall short on higher difficulties on their own. You should basically be chain detonating on silvers more and basically be doing it constantly on golds. The amount of damage you can put out with well timed firecryobiotictech combos is absurd. A lot of abilities can prime and detonate and some classes even have completely spammable detonations without cooldowns. Teamwork or learn how to chain those combos to use them well on your own.A lot of weapons are garbage though. Like the semi auto rifles are annoying to use even though they sometimes feel good but they dont feel good enough. Half the list of ARs feels absolutely worthless compared to the better ones because theyre just that bad.Combos can also easily be weakened from  because they made them so much more versatile. Biotics and tech powers now work seamlessly together to combo. You can now biotic detonate with overload which also primes so you can turn that into another detonation so you can look at something like a chain of biotic prime gt incinerate detprime gt overload detprime gt throw. And thats just one example of what you can end up doing now.Playing gold and using a single overload even with stacked shield damage feels like pissing in the wind though but honestly it seems like a much more balance oriented change now because you could go before without ever touching a gun really and just using absurdly powerful powers.,masseffect,dg3nhkg,5,t5_2rc19

Its simple yet elegant and effective.gt same goes for the main characters voice actor he sounds like hes dying of a terminal disease all the time or somethingI agree that Geralt can sound bored and uninspired at times but I dont know I think it works for the character. It might be that Ive gotten used to it over the course of the series though.gtNot saying the animations are perfect whatsoever but it was amazingly overblown by people saying they took you out of the immersion. Man if that takes you out of the immersion you should dislike a LOT of games these days.I agree that it was overblown but some of the animations were incredibly painful to watch and often ruined the tone of cutscenes. If things like that doesnt bother you then hey good for you. I usually dont care about that stuff either but there have been a couple of cases were the animation have taken me out of the scene and caused me to miss a couple of lines of dialogue because of it. So based purely on my own experience there are or were at least cases of animation bad enough to ruin immersion in this game.gtAnd the voice acting? People criticize the voice acting of Andromeda? Really? Wow.You criticized Geralts voice acting I dont see how this is any different. As for my opinion its not so much the actors as it is the directing. It at times seems like the actors havent been given proper direction as the tone of the dialogue doesnt match up with whats happening in game. This is one of those things that havent bothered me at all but I can totally see why it would some.As for why youre being downvoted Im guessing its because your statement on the quality of TW was pure opinion but you presented it as a fact.

All the people in your stats are respawning for the sake of gameplay not the sake of the story. I wouldnt consider statistics on how many outlaws Ive killed in the gameplay as representation of the real population in the story itself.That being said the nexus is a very large piece of construction. It clearly arrived in andromeda long before the arks did and considering how large it is compared to those it wouldnt surprise me if it brought a very large contingent of people itself for the purpose of initial settlement to get things ready for people on the arks and construction of the nexus in full. It probably brought more all workers but even if the nexus brought half of what each ark brought k and youve killed k thats still k unaccounted for in your statistics plus the k per ark. Factor into that the pathfinder isnt a psycho serial killer just murdering harmless innocent people who just want to settle in andromeda and no theres no danger of the pathfinder wiping out everyone andor becoming a danger to the initiative.,masseffect,dg5p7wn,1,t5_2rc19

As with most boss fights in Mass Effect its all about controlling all the mooks who are arguably more dangerous than the actual boss. The three or four phantoms he summons with each wave can one shot you just as easily as Kai Leng so theyre the real danger in that fight.

Killing is not the same as assassinating or murdering.By whose definition?If you are going to tout religion here I must warn you.  The original translation from GreekLatin states specifically that Gods commandments are Thou Shalt not kill...and the Greeks and Romans had different words for kill and murder as well.  It was not until King James version came along and they rewrote it to the Kings whim to take out kill and replace with murder.  The intent was to prevent people from feeling bad about going to war.

11584717,0,t3_659fd7,Maybe the whole thing is just too difficult for Ryder? I came to think that while SAM can improve bioamp energy effectiveness field intensity and stuff like this it absolutely cant substitute prolonged training.I mean Ryders biotic moves are mostly tame compared to the OT. Only Singularity and Annihilation are in the slightly harder territory. Blink is kinda questionable since we dont have any ingame explanation for it yet. But nothing comes close to DominateReaveDark Channel in terms of complexity.So ScottSarah are probably not skilled enough to maintain a barrier that big. Not even talking about PB because judging by gameplay she only uses simple biotic moves relying on her innate abilities and nothing else. She even uses jump jets instead of the signature Asari midair hover.Sarissa and Cora on the other hand spent a lot of time training their biotic skills. Judging by Sarissas field of work and experience she is probably as good as Samara. And Samara was pretty close to the biotic prodigy Jack in terms of strength.TLDR Ryderwith SAMs help is powerful but not particulary skilled. Cora and Sarissa are pretty skilled.,masseffect,dg94ux9,6,t5_2rc19

Im hoping youre not suggesting telling people that I think they can eat an Adhis shit will radicalize them because thats just silly.  As far as internet shit talk goes thats pretty mild. The altright circles are welcome to be annoyed at the perceived pandering to the inclusion of gay and trans people if they like.  Just as Im allowed to be peeved about them complaining about what other people are complaining about.  Personally I have no problem with them expressing their view points and Im only telling them in what I thought would be a humorous inuniverse manner to eat shit because Im not a fan of brigading threateninginsulting animators on twitter calling people cucks and labeling anyone who wants to be able to get all the games achievements without breaking their sexual orientation SJWs.  Yes we all know there is an SJW type and the internet outrage machine is real and yes it often is annoying.  But if were being totally honest SJW is a pejorative used to dismiss the content of someones arguments.   Lets put the shoe on the other foot if straight males only had two romance options and needed to have one gay romance scene to complete the romance achievement would we label people who complained about that as SJWs?  Or do we only use that term to dismiss people who complain for representation that isnt heteronormative?  I dont  know the answers to those questions necessarily.  But as the intersection of politics and gaming is only going to increase going forward I think its important for us as a community to consider them.  ,masseffect,dg9j9qz,5,t5_2rc19

11623339,0,t1_dgdej9r,I dont really agree with this at all. Played on insanity on my first playthrough and are playing my second now. Sure im not going to say that they dont have increased health but no way near that much like me had. If you focus on weapon damage you wont really have a problem with that at all. But with that said going going with an adept or engineer build I can see it being more of a trouble. Mostly because that you only have  skills and thats not enough if its going to be your main source of damage in my opinion. I havent really played around much with engineer and adept so much or biotics at all infact but even if you would add all combo dmgradius etc I dont think it would be enough at all.So if you focus on weapon damage you wont really have that much of a problem. For example playing with an avenger is not really that bad if you hit weakspots. If you go against a fiend take invasion etc to get debuffs. But I am a little bit sad that they did not just make if you pick engineeradept you get  extra abilties. In me it was really good sure there was global cooldown but the cooldown was really low so you could still spam abilties if you wanted aslong as you are not overequipping weapons.One of the biggest reason people say that every enemy is bullet sponges I atleast think is because they dont focus on weapon dmg enough. Or playing with rifles that are just plain bad. Im not going to say that the revenant is horse shit but the accuracy is to bad unless you go a full tank build and just stand in peoples faces or playing around with turbocharge and going for alot of accuracy and stability.I personally think the worst insanity in the series is me. And thats only because pretty much every enemy gets shieldsarmorbarrier. This would not really be that big a problem if you still could use biotics on shielded enemies but that whole game is being played like a bunker war. Because in andromeda even if the enemy have increased health and dmg output you still can rely on movement much more then you could in past games. Like in me you pretty much became a god because the enemys were so weak. It was not challenging at all. Even harvesters that was the big enemies just died in seconds with combos and weapon dmg.This became WAY longer post then I intended but we this are aleast my thoughts on insanity. Just for short focusing on weapon dmg insanity wont really be a problem but for adeptengineer  skills are not enough. EDIT I forgot to talk a little bit about consumables I pretty much never used them at all because it was just annoying to press tab and then put it on and it only lasted for a couple of mags. But they help alot more then I thought they would when I tried them from time to time. But I still rarely care enough to equip them.,masseffect,dgdim46,1,t5_2rc19

11626352,0,t3_65x5r1,Im on board with this point of view. Ive completed one playthrough  and on into my second one. Your point is the biggest issue I have with the game. There is just too much going on most of which isnt compelling or important. A lot of responses youll get are you can just ignore it you can just do main missions and loyalty missions if you want. The issue is that because there is so much content the important content such as storyloyalty missions dont have the punch they should do. Nothing is bad about them but I only really felt totally immersed in the missions about once or twice.There are really good parts of the game. Combat is tight and varied and squad banter when it isnt interrupted is the best in the series. Ive said several times its a  game. Not bad at all.

11643417,0,t1_dgfs5yq,I mean even comparing the combat one is a shooter and one is a dodge and dark souls lite version rpg fight system so it really makes no sense to be talking about it in that regard. TW whether you think so or not redefined what a lot of people expect from games that are supposed to be focused on writing and narrative. Bioware COULD have taken a different approach and instead focused on player choice meaning more and making their entire games based around personal decisions and customization of characters and role in the universes as we hoped they would but MEA is a step back from DAI let alone the other games its being compared to. Overhype has nothing to do with it to be honest. I wanted Classic Star Trek and thats what they tried to sell to me and instead I got Abrams Star Trek. Simple as that. Sure Abrams Star Trek can be fun and I have enjoyed it on occasion but it doesnt substitute for what I had hoped would be a brand new slate wiped clean to go in new directions but ended up being more of the same even less so than previous titles.I get that you want to be talking about people like sheep because you keep hearing it compared to other games that are better but maybe its just because almost universally people have seen better games even in this year alone than MEA and just because this one has shooty bits that are fun doesnt make the rest of the audience that came for narrative story and not game breaking bugs and terrible programming choices any less valid. Im happy that you like shooting and if thats what ME is going to focus on with its money begging multiplayer then thats fine but its not what I came to ME for and its not what Ill be buying again in the future until it shows that it goes back to other things I wanted out of it. All of my issues and many peoples issues would be fixed if the game did ANYTHING better than their own games have done in the past but aside from shooting I dont see why this game is worth the price tag.

The most they say is that a mass effect field decreases the mass of the ship and powerful thrusters propell the superlight object a speeds faster than light. Then halfway to the destination they turn the ship and fire the thrusters again to slow the ship. The reason they dont go into detail is they have no explaination for the phenomenon of time slowing down the closer to the speed of light you travel. And if you were really traveling faster than light time would be going in reverse around you and youd wind up at your destination before you even left.

They dont learn the lessons that take decades to learn because they die too fast. In addition almost no Salarian ever sees the fruition of his or her work unless it has an immediate pay off. Instead they have to just contend with simulations.Salarians just dont have to deal with the consequences of their actions its always someone elses problem. So they dont learn from mistakes except in how to do something better. Genophage not working. Krogans evolve too fast. Simulations show please population unstable. Cant reeducate Krogan too hostile. Must kill Krogan fetus faster. Has to be me someone else might not kill them faster enough.Mordin it seems was the only Salarian who lived long enough to gain wisdom and sought to fix his mistake. Other Salarians never get that chance so their entire culture just goes on their merry way doing whatever they please with no regard to their actions.Its why I dont like Salarians.

I mean heshe is still number one but sometimes I wanna grow into the badass shoes and see that development for myself. Instead of you know having come out of soloing that one thresher maw that destroyed my whole squad.Scott and Sara are a lot more relatable.

If AIs were already illegal that would make no sense whatsoever. So we are left to assume the councils order is very recent.

Even if no other constraints applied wed still suffer from being unable to perceive time in a way similar to the  spatial dimensions. Wed still be inherently subjective etc. Theres no reason to believe that in the ME universe AI are automatically free of constraints even if they can theoretically rewrite themselves to be virtually anything.They could by that logic rewrite themselves to not be Reapers. The cycle would stop. Why havent they? The obvious answer is because the story demands that they havent but you could attempt to apply the above to it and simply say that a Reaper just like us has a sense of self that it wants to continually preserve. They were made with a focus on the Milky Way even if their remit could really allow them to go anywhere in the universe and so they focused on the Milky Way.Why didnt they go elsewhere is like asking... actually I cant think of a decent metaphor here. Like... why havent you spent the last  years on a raft in the ocean or a really big lake? With water filtration Im sure it could be made to work. Humans are adaptable and can deal with a lot. So why didnt you? Because you made other choices. Because even though humans can survive certainly with the help of modern technology in a situation like that its not really what we evolved to do.You could take this in a free will vs. no free will direction as well and sit here  years later saying that you could have gone on that raft. And in the end thats all you really are doing. Saying you could have. It wasnt in the cards then so you never really couldve made that choice. Theoretically youre free to make a lot of varied choices but as they dont occur to you you couldnt have made them. I guess what Im saying in a roundabout way is that the Reapers arent necessarily so very far removed from this train of logic AI or not as we might imagine. They could have gone to other galaxies but they didnt. It wasnt in the cards.,masseffect,dgpalay,2,t5_2rc19

Especially since it doesnt seem like theres been that much time thats gone by. Even in real life it takes months before people usually say that to one another. The game never makes clear how much time has passed so its ambiguous which is fine but considering the limited number of interactions we see the characters go through its just kind of jarring. Vetra tells you she loves you before youve even hugged her. One kiss at most? One time hand holding? This is why I advocate saving I love you for a second game.

But even still these high level similarities shouldnt necessitate such low level similarities too. Just because a species has a sense of lovefriendship shouldnt mean that they experience it the same way we do or have same mating customs. In fact we humans already have different mating customs and experience love differently across the globe.

11754873,0,t1_dgseuse,Add this stage thanks to the efforts of the modding community its actually quite easy to import custom models and modify their characteristics just need to have a base vanilla weapon to start from. The Gladius involved a lot of work a lot of testing and a lot of backandforth. The biggest challenges we faced for the Gladius at least from my perspective was. Ensuring that it worked with the folding weapon animations. Early iterations look horrible when folded up so that required some mesh editing to ensure it looked decent. Ensuring the streaming file worked well. This means designing the right coalesced and mount file to ensure that the game recognized the weapon as valid versus ignoring it or outright crashing the EGM team has become masters at streaming. Balancing was critical. The Gladius was intended to be a difficult weapon to master. Starting with the Argus one of the most underused weapons in the game we increased its magazine modified its mesh enhanced its damage output. Yet we decided to barely touch its recoil in order to avoid creating an OP weapon. As to why the modding community hasnt expanded it usage You need a good team to pull this off.  As far I recall the Gladius involved at least five individuals myself Nach of deviantart kinkojiro Rusm and Mellin. I doubt that without the aid of these individuals the Gladius wouldnt have left the drawing board. Also space By the end of its developersupport cycle MEs armory was quite extensive. Im not saying that its impossible but I would argue that the lowhangingfruit has been snapped up. ,masseffect,dgsg0i9,2,t5_2rc19

It would make sense that you would download your people into massive ships saving space and have an automated system terraform the cluster before creating vessels to down load the population into.In short Merridian is an automated arkship that has its population stored as DNA sequences and clones its population after automatically terraforming its destination.,masseffect,dgyekiw,10,t5_2rc19
