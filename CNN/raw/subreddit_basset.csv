126147,0,t1_cesmaff,Everyone who sees our pups in pics think they are mellow but when they see them in real life they are amazed at their energy.  Truth is the only time you can get a clear picture is when theyre sitting still which isnt often.  For every clear picture there are hundreds of blurry ones!,basset,cessogg,1,t5_2su6v
147579,0,t1_cev5ayi,I care very much about my dogs well being and weve never been recommended to cut her nails by a vet nor has anyone in my family seen the need. My dog has never shown any signs of discomfort shes about the happiest dog I can think of.,basset,cev8noj,1,t5_2su6v
524224,0,t3_203g2j,There is an easy fix to this.  I have a very good boy on walks and its because of a few reasons. Number  be consistent.  Dont let him win and you know what I am talking about.  Bassets are smarter than they let up.  Number  shorten the leash.  Only allow him  feet on the leash and every now and then turn around and walk the opposite direction dont stop or tell him youre turning around just do it.  This will make the basset start looking up at you to see where YOU are going.  Number  We have very food motivated animals here to say the least... Make him sit at each corner and give him a treat for doing so.  If he knows you have treats he will pay attention. My Higgins is a good walker and has been for  years now but to this day he will know if I have treats on me or not.  He will not sit on the corner unless he can smell the treats in my pocket.  He is smart.  Remember dont expect perfection he is a basset.,basset,cfzuyvm,7,t5_2su6v

5752863,0,t3_3txslp,I made the mistake of taking my Basset on a business trip recently. My wife was out of the country and I really dont like boarding my fur baby. My thought was she will be happier staying with me vs being boarded in a kennel. The first day I left the hotel for work Carly had a nervous breakdown and would not stop crying and barking. One of my friends who lives in the local area suggested a doggy day care where she takes her pets. So that is where she had to spend her days while I was at work. The point Im trying to make and my vet confirmed is it very common for dogs to behave differently when removed from their comfort zone. Id consider talking to a vet to get a professional opinion and getting toys dog beds and treats to make them feel as comfortable in their new space as possible. Just help them get adjusted. Good luck!,basset,cxa74o6,5,t5_2su6v

8981381,0,t3_537xed,Our girl had some back and knee issues starting about a year and a half ago or so. Our old vet tried some things but it only helped to a point. After her second episode we switched vets and started her on lazer actupucture and it took a while mostly because we didnt find her knee issues right away but shes back to her old self for the most part climbing up stairs easily and with daily walks although theyre a bit shorter now as shes around  or  now. We started off with treatments every  weeks or so but are now down to once every  months. She takes glucosamine and a herbal joint pill twice a day and a  of a doggy asprin pill roughly  times a week. We also picked up some doggy stairs she uses for getting on and off the couchbed and into and out of the car to reduce as much impact as we canWe did have to go through two to  weeks of pure bedrest during this time which was pretty tough on her as she was a very active dog. ,basset,d7rfauk,1,t5_2su6v

Were also looking at local group puppy training sessions and going to slowly introduce him to friends and family and take him on outings as he gets older. Weve heard good things about dog seatbelts but well keep looking into it. Weve experienced backseat drool with taking my SOs moms dogs to the park. Getting a mat is great advice.
