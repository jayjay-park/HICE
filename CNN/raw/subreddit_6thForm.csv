154154,0,t1_cevw2un,Im not OP but I was the exact same as him.I took Biology Chemistry History and Music Technology. I dropped Music Technology halfway through Year  as I was not enjoying it at all. Ive applied to University for Chemistry and all of the courses I have looked at require  A Grades instead of UCAS Points where the extra AS would of been beneficial and so I have been at no disadvantage EDIT The advantage to taking the th AS at A level is that some courses at University want UCAS Points and so the extra points from the AS can help take off a grade or two for your grades at A.For example you possibly could only need BCCc instead of BBB,6thForm,cevzmud,2,t5_2ybtn

We toyed with the idea of making MathsFurther MathsPhysicsComputing revision videos but currently were working on a Flash animation with a plot revolving around various famous maths problems mainly Bridges of Koenigsberg Hilberts Hotel and pancake sorting and also a lot of references to other maths things in the backgrounds and dialogue. Not really revision but it does make use of the term semiEulerian path and weve got a shot with one of the SUVAT equations in.

The workload hasnt been too bad for me although its really starting to ramp up now were hitting exam season. The lack of free periods has been annoying but if you love your subjects and can motivate yourself to study then youll be fine.However I think you should keep your subjects in mind. Both the other commenters did Maths and Further Maths as two of their subjects and theres a reason for that its more like . AS levels than  in terms of workload. You didnt say what you plan to take but you should know that there is a big difference between taking say double Maths Physics and double ICT and taking History English RE Chemistry and Biology. Im talking volume of coursework time spent writing essays volume of content to memorise... nobody Ive heard of took  AS allmostly humanities and pulled it off. You might be able to but use your judgement. Dont do what my friends doing and deal with the workload by ignoring it entirely! If you cant manage it you cant manage it.

I mean thats stupid what do they have to gain from that the standard offer grades are clearly the grades you need to be able to successfully go into and do the course and theyre only reducing their chances of admitting a student whos above the required grade level onto the course... Ive heard in the exceptional circumstances theyve done it to push the student academically during Alevels but I dont get why its necessary haha. My head of year also said though that in these rare circumstances often theyll admit the student anyway based on the original offer entry requirements if they dont meet the raised requirements which kinda makes sense with the pushing the student thing. To make a long story short you dont have anything to worry about great that youve been predicted those high grades but you just need the standard offer grades to get in.

Unfortunately the majority of universities on the tier of Edinburgh for CSSE and all the ones Im considering applying to require maths or for some at least computing Alevel regardless of how much programming and whatnot you do outside of school thats just the way it is I can see why they impose that filtering requirement as they still receive plenty of successful applications but its their loss in terms of students like yourself! The good news is that there are still plenty of great reputable universities out there for CSSE that dont require maths come to my local university Surrey!

6113329,0,t3_3z2fww,I did AS maths and was working at around the same level as you. Some people have good natural maths ability and others dont  if you dont that doesnt necessarily mean you cant do it it means youll have to do a lot of past papers and revision to pass. Although I did a lot of past papers got a B in my mock after getting countless Ds and Es but then in the real thing I came out with a D grade overall due to panicking in the exam and making a lot of small errors. So the bottom line is if youre willing to put in the time and do lots of revision then theres really no point in dropping it as youll probably come out okay and get a good grade. If you dont want to do that then you could drop it but in my opinion a better option would be to continue with it and put in a little more effort then if by exam time you dont feel that youve done enough to pass then just dont revise and focus on youre other subjects then who knows  you might still get a C grade and can then drop it for year .,6thForm,cykitp2,3,t5_2ybtn

I recommend learning a little programming  just simple Visual Basic tutorials should suffice covering stuff such as iteration and data arrays. Also these YouTube videos are a good starting point for learning the specification content and are fairly short takes a few hours to learn the entire spec. basically  however some of the A videos are mixed in so make sure you check the descriptions of each video to see if its AS or only A.Honestly though dont work too hard.

I find this subreddit to be more cluttered especially since it has no flairs so I have to read the whole title or post to even know what its about.I dont think rGCSE is just about exams. The hot post right now has nothing to do with exams and there have been many posts that have nothing to do with exams and just general discussions. If you go on the front page here you will see just as many posts to do with exams since thats the main things these subreddits are about.I dont see how the suggestions of improving the sidebar flairs stickies etc would make this subreddit too serious or more exam oriented. How would a different design ruin the subreddit if its directly ADDING features to make it better to use.

11299511,0,t3_615cy1,I had this in my first year AS. Im in YR  now I didnt do so well in the first year but I pushed my way forward going from BDD to AAB Maths Physics and Chemistry and I have received  offers from great Unis with an interview on Thursday for the last. Keep going you can make it. What helped me stop my OCD was my religious beliefs as they didnt allow me to act on the thoughts I was having. Perhaps try and get in the mind frame that these things wont help you. It may take time or it may be quick to get rid of it but just work for it. Everytime you get an OCD thought think it isnt something I have to do. I find it hard to explain but I hope you get better.,6thForm,dfcs6to,1,t5_2ybtn

Also there are a lot of economics resources online so if you dont understand something just google it youll likely find the answer and it will probably be easier to understand and more concise than the sleepdeprived ramblings of any teacher.

Personally Victorian Politics is my jam but tudors were doing. I find it deathly boring but I somehow made myself find it interesting and once you start enjoying it then its much easier to do. If I remember correctly the way I started to become interested in it was doing my own extra curricula stuff. There was something in lesson that piqued my interest at first a tiny thing that sent me down a rabbit hole. It felt like pulling on a loose thread and suddenly everything was connected to everything else and I ended up feeling a motivation to understand the reformation Parliament or whatever. ,6thForm,dg8933e,1,t5_2ybtn
