291884,0,t3_1xerh6,The connection I feel to other juggalos is more a respect and understanding that even if you are a total ass hole of a person that I have no desire to associate with you are still a human being and I apply this to everyone rather I know you or not. I dont judge anyone thats willing to offer the same courtesy  not just to me but everyone  and I know other juggalos will usually come through with this. The second part to this is we are free to be ourselves while giving absolutely no concern to what anyone else thinks of us. I absolutely never feel the need to impress anyone which in and of its self seems to put people off or maybe Im just an unlikable person but I end up becoming very close with those that arent bothered by it . Try to imagine it like this  there are two sides of everyone. Think of all the things about you that you may not be proud of or perhaps wouldnt want someone to know on a first date. Now think of everything that makes you an awesome person or amazing friend. When I do this I find both lists have many of the same things on them and it just all depends on how I look at myself and other peoples view of me is rather irrelevant. This seems rather anti social at first but when I realized this about myself I learned to think the same about everyone else. What I think about someone elses life and the decisions theyve made is irrelevant. Juggalo culture and the message in icps music helped me come to these personal truths. ,juggalo,cfb0o64,0,t5_2sjwx

3833583,0,t1_cqt9a9q,You probably feel the same way I did about MDP. When it came out I listened to it a lot but found that I didnt like it. A lot of the songs were just pop culture references and I didnt like most of the beats. I thought that maybe after listening for over  years that I had just outgrown it or that they arent what they used to be. And of course theyre not what they used to be because they used to be mad at the world and had that old school rap background. I cant blame them for changing their sound up all the time. If an artist never changed their sound after  something years it would get extremely old. At least with ICP they have so many albums and other works that everyone can find an era or cd they like and just enjoy it. ,juggalo,cqt9foz,2,t5_2sjwx

9695777,0,t3_5dxxmu,Hells Pit will forever be my favorite Jokers Card. This came out at such a perfect time in my life. It was the first ICP album I bought. I remember riding my bike up to Best Buy which was further than I was allowed to ride my bike I remember walking up and down the CD aisle noticing the orange slightly Indiana JonesEsque album art thinking oh shit is this NEW? Didnt they JUST come out at a Christian band? So I buy the album Best Buy never cared about Parental Advisory stickers pop in in my CD player and ride my bike home. From Intro to Manic Depressive Real Underground Baby isnt exactly a real song I was floored. The beats were sick the lyrics were dark and raw and vulnerable it was a perfect fit for a  year old angsty pseudogoth kid. Its actually one of the few CDs that I still have.  I really hope their second delve into Hells Pit is as inspired as this one although with their new looks on life and how theyve described working on Hells Pit before I have a feeling it wont be.  Also the song Truly Alone is good. ,juggalo,da87l0h,8,t5_2sjwx
