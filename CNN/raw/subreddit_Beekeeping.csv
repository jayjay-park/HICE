410594,0,t1_cfnboo3,ampampamp Pollen source nsfwstartNSFW ? gtThe term pollen source is often used in the context of beekeeping and refers to flowering plants as a source of pollen for bees or other insects. Bees collect pollen as a protein source to raise their brood. For the plant the pollinizer this can be an important mechanism for sexual reproduction as the pollinator distributes its pollen. Few flowering plants selfpollinate some can provide their own pollen self fertile but require a pollinator to move the pollen others are dependent on cross pollination from a genetically different source of viable pollen through the activity of pollinators. One of the possible pollinators to assist in crosspollination are honeybees.

Plus it is free I like freeIMHO he is one of the best beekeepers alive today.Also youtube search Don the Fat Bee Man Dixie bee supply as he has a ton of info to share. Check the videos from Michael Palmer as well. Those are very insightful.  Here is a link to one of Palmers videos...Also look at Google Books for Langstroths books. They are also free online.  One note about Beekeeping for Dummies. There is a section in that book about what to do if you find queen cells in your hive. The book tells you to destroy them. This IMHO is a bad idea. The bees are making a new queen for a reason. Maybe the old one is old and tired. If you kill all the queen cells you may end up queenless. Doing a split with those cells may be a better option as if they are replacing their queen you can always put a queen back into the hive from the split. If it is for a swarm then if you get all the cells out into a split or nuc you MAY be able to stop the swarm and keep all your bees in the hive.

963107,0,t1_chdn8ps,We absolutely agree that research is the key! Monsanto should be funding large  long term research studies directed by independent scientists as a condition on their being allowed to sell new chemicals for widespread agricultural use!That said MANY problems in honeybee colonies can and are isolated and I am simply confused about why articles like this claim that Monsanto causes CCD despite the absence of evidence backing their conclusion.My personal hypothesis is that neonics and other pesticides are leading to ever increasing mortality that leads to more instances of hive death but that CCD specifically a very quick dwindling of foragers in a hives population without observation of large numbers of dead bees is being dramatically overreported if it even exists. I suspect that this kind of sensational reporting on CCD leads many nonscientist beekeepers to attribute dead hives to CCD when they would have previously just left it as a mystery.That said Ive read reports from respected researchers that indicate the specific symptoms of CCD have been repeatedly observed even if its relatively rare.In my personal non expert opinion we should focus on the problem of increasing give mortality which is absolutely exacerbated by insecticide use rather than pretending that CCD is a clear diagnosis much less one with a clear cause.Of course increasing bee mortality through a dozen or so factors doesnt make good news like Monsanto is wiping out all the bees!!!,Beekeeping,chdrj11,2,t5_2qtzm

1354191,0,t3_29ijai,I dont really understand what you are trying to accomplish or why. Your drones will leave your hives and fly to nearby DCAs maybe a quarter of mile away. Your queens will also leave and fly to DCAs but they tend to go to ones further like maybe a half mile out so they purposefully dont mate with drones from their own hive. Your queens are going to mate with drones from hives you dont own where you have no control of the quality of the stock from those hives not good stock.  What good is it going to do to contain your nominally good drones in the hive since your queens most likely wont mate with them anyway? All you will be doing is keeping your supposedly good genetics from entering the general population and still bringing back who knows what from the wild. The only way to truly control queen breeding is artificial insemination. Your next best bet is to saturate the area with daughter queens from your hives so the majority of the drones out there are good. There is a queen breeder in S. Florida that does this by giving queens to all the local beekeepers like up to mi away so the area  is saturated with European drones and not Africanized ones. But I dont think you will be able to do this if you are starting out.Any excluder you put on a hive will keep a queen in as well as a drone which will keep her from mating.,Beekeeping,cim1esm,3,t5_2qtzm

If you have no winter to contend with then go ahead and split. On the other hand you could add another box and in any place it would only benefit your bees. If you have to deal with winters I would recommend the Third deep box the more honey the better.

1618889,0,t3_2cuq1x,A bee operation is usually called an Apiary. Apiary is Latin for bee yard.  In Central america there are Africanized bees but not in joysey.  In fact in Central America a lot of beekeepers use Africanized honey bees. They use them because they swarm a lot more bees they will take over other beehives they produce more honey and thrive in the climate.  They are more aggressive so they will follow you further attack you for less of any reason attack further from the hive more bees will attack and they really like to send out a welcoming party.  Same suit as normal I use Carpenter pants a Carhartt work shirt helmetveil gloves and beltsneakers. But you can buy a full or half suit and or we. That suit will give you great protection.

And dont forget to drink plenty of water you will overheat fast.    Same equipment as in smoker hive tool.  No clue on techniques you need for africanized honey bees. Guess ask the locals and watch you tube.  Its called a hive and supposedly not an africanized expert but they really like the ground and choosing their own hives.  You should make sure yourself and everyone within  meters is not allergic to africanized stings. Keep benadryl and if you can afford it a epipen close until everyone has gotten stung.

2980083,0,t3_2uads5,IF you find a local beekeeper ask what kind of hive they use.Those using Langstroth hives typically reuse the comb and probably even use plastic foundation.  They may use bees wax foundation but it is likely wired foundation.  For these reasons Langstroth hives are conducive to honey production without comb.  You CAN produce comb honey in a Langstroth but most Langstroth beekeepers do not do it.Top Bar Hives and Warre hives are used by beekeepers that make comb honey.  These hive types mostly require destroying the comb to extract the honey.  So many beekeepers that use these hives offer comb honey.  These hive types are popular with natural beekeepersBut the ULTIMATE solution...start your own hive!  Top Bar Hives are simple and cheap to build if you are handy and are exactly what you would want to produce your own honey.,Beekeeping,co6unbk,2,t5_2qtzm

If it really has the potential to bring significant numbers in and these people are the kind that arent responsible a lot of hives will be shipped off to their deaths at the hands of rookies who bought it without learning first. On the other hand it will also bring good beekeepers. I for one plan on waiting on field reports of the flow frame use before I decide if Ill buy a couple frames.

Swarm cells are usually to the periphery on the sides and bottoms of the frames and combs. There are usually a number more can be upwards of  per frame if its swarm cells. Swarm cells are also straight like peanuts.If the cells are supercedure cells there are fewer between  is most common. Supercedure cells also tend to happen in the middle of a brood comb frame. They are curved like fingers or other things youd note for being shaped that way.If its a supercedure and you like this queen you can make a split from your other hive or whatnot and put her there her old hive will still requeen itself shell just keep working.,Beekeeping,crf7bte,4,t5_2qtzm

My gloves are thick tough and I have duct tape wrapped around the wrists so that the bees cant sting through the mesh near the wrists. It is my humble opinion that you should have full gear for anyone around a beehive.   These are bees.  They get angry.  They go from zero to angry if they smell your breath if you squish one or if you accidentally drop a frame.    Accidents happen! If you want your family to really enjoy the bees full gear is the way to go.    All of the gear all of the time. I commend you for involving your family.  If you protect them really well beekeeping can be super!  If you think you can get by with simply having veils on and wearing no gloves you are setting yourself up for the worst thing you can do.... which is avoid your hive and not be a good inspector when the bees really need it. I am sitting here with two stings on my hands one on my neck one on my ear one on my chin and one on my back....  You know why?   Simple mistake and a tiny hole in my veil.

If hive  has emergency cells queens in the middle instead of the outsides of the frame then you need to leave a few behind because their current queen is in need of replacement but you can use some of the extras in simplex  to requeen.

It makes it faster and less tedious especially if you have a lot of frames. The roller does damage the cells a bit bit so does using a knife. With the knife they need to re extend the cells with the roller they just need to repair them. If you over roll you can destoy the frames. All you need to dobis apply a little pressure to pop the capped cell. Ive had no issues with the bees fixing the rolled cells and refilling them pretty quickly.,Beekeeping,csuzz7d,1,t5_2qtzm

4480722,0,t3_3ch1m6,While there are some people and areas that do this three dedicated areas for their bees before excess supers I feel its important to remind you that the bees will determine their own brood chamber dimensions. That third box could easily become just a honey super to them making it nearly impossible to inspect the lower brood chambers with the box weighing anywhere from lbs.I would by far suggest a Medium over a Deep for this process. You could middle super like youre suggesting to force it to be drawn or just put it on top in case theyd like to draw some more.One of the benefits of two Deeps as a brood chamber over three is that when you need to do a quick inspection you can simply open it like a hamburger and check between the boxes. If you have three you cannot perform this action because the upper boxes are too heavy and youre using the lower box as a fulcrum greatly risking the upper area falling off.Natural beehives are L as beekeepers we easily provide x that much volume. Were not talking about normal little bee hamlets were talking about bee metropolises. There are techniques for building hives that peak with over  members.Final thought If you go with three Deeps as your broodnest I believe your inspections will likely suffer for it rather than benefit for the reasons above.,Beekeeping,csvgnhx,2,t5_2qtzm

5330913,0,t1_cvroy69,Okay so Im finally getting to watch the video properly now knowing youre the actual presenter. I hope you dont mind if I do something of a running commentary.Are your gloves tight enough? Im a bit worried your suit isnt loose enough either. Ill keep an eye on your hands a bit more as we go forward.Is...is that glass covering the hole in your inner cover? This isnt too huge but that hole is for ventilating the excess heatmoisture from your hive. You could put an untreated burlap sack on top if you dont want the bees up there which is why I assume the top is set up the way it is.I need to put this in here Great work with the smoke! I see lots of first years puff and puff and puff their smoke and fail to even do a five count after the inner cover smoking. Excellently done!The comb isnt too old maybe a year or two. Set them to be cycled out in about  years. Very old comb is black and brittle. Oh thats YOUR comb my bad. Yes their comb is about  years old it needs to be changed out but theres not a massive rush to get rid of it. When spring comes put a single undrawn frame between two straight combs and then let them draw it out. Take the comb furthest to the side away. Once theyve finished drawing it out you can do another or even if they all move into the top box you can just take the bottom box away during rotations cull out the worst combs and then give back the old woodenware.You have nice shoes. I know unrelated to beekeeping but I like them. Do you have elastic to hold the bottom of your suit to your ankles because your bees arent terrible but its one place for them to get trapped panicky and sting.I saw it happen and thought it was a random occurrence but now I see I was wrong. Dont just throw away comb you scrape off. If the bees are off of it just crush it into a ball with your hand otherwise set it out or flick them off. Wax even shavings on the ground gives off a pungent odor that announces to predators and pests that there is a vulnerable beehive in the area nearby. While those little bits are little at first they also quickly pile up rendered wax also sells for about the same to twice the price of liquid honey. Put it in your pocket for later.Looks like this is where you and I both wrap up this post.,Beekeeping,cvt318d,1,t5_2qtzm

Ive seen hives make W and U shaped comb to deflect and control air currents.It should be mentioned that context like if youre in the north or southern hemisphere is important since I cant recommend you do it now if youre in the north due to being the dead of winter while if youre in the south you likely have good temperatures for asking your bees to be patient with you.Assuming youre in the southern hemisphere or a northerner prepping for spring renovations I suggest getting out a new brood box moving all  frames to it and add the extras then. Sweep the extra bees on the sides of the box into the new one and then go about cleaning it. If the propolis is attached to the queen excluder just remove it and either scrape the propolis or put it in the freezer and then break it off once its brittle.Using grain alcohol the propolis can be dissolved into it as a tincture and sold for medicinal use.As always if you have any questions please feel free to ask. ,Beekeeping,cz4xaxn,1,t5_2qtzm
6344456,0,t1_czar8pa,So bottom board then your deeps probably then your supers then inner cover then telescoping outer cover. You dont need different sized boxes. I use all interchangeable mediums.  Your Brood nest will be towards the bottom though. Sometimes you have to do some management to keep it there but thats where the mostly keep brood and pollen with the upper levels being full honey frames. I dont use a queen excluder. So I can get brood up above I had a really enthusiastic queen lay eggs in unwanted wild comb they built from the inside of the inner cover when I tried putting a feeding jar right on the frames now I just put feeding jars on top of the inner cover. But I check each frame anyway so its not like Im going to accidentally harvest brood comb for honey. I only have a couple hives so I can easily just manage frame by frame. Anyway my point being brood is generally on the bottom enforced or not. The deeper boxes are generally used for brood. However that means you need to keep both sizes of frames and foundation and cant swap frames from one into the other to open up the brood nest or whatever. ,Beekeeping,czasltx,3,t5_2qtzm

6419689,0,t3_43m19w,I feed patties in early spring.  The first point is that if youre going to do it dont underfeed!  Theres always a guessing game as to if youll have a cold snap or a long wet spring.  I also have my hives wrapped for the winter so I just open them for a minute add the patties and mite strips and close them back up for another couple of weeks.  Then feed syrup as I can.  I aim for  gallon of  syrup in the spring and  pounds of patty to give them a boost.  I use carniolan queens so in general my hives usually still have plenty of feed before I start this process.  You really just have to be honest with your assessment in the spring.  Anything less than  frames of bees I cull and if it makes it through the remainder of winter combine it since these hives usually end up going nowhere otherwise. years ago I had  weeks of early warm weather in which I managed to feed half my colonies patties.  This was followed by  weeks of down to C weather.  Then when the warm weather returned I fed the rest.  In the end the early fed hives did no better and did slightly worse on total dead outs.

If you winter on norwegian polystyrene hive bodies like the rest of us I dont believe they froze to death. This winter has not been THAT cold. But if you fed them less than  kilos of sugar before wintering death is pretty unavoidable without emergency feeding in early spring. Applying Apifonda in cold weather is usually not a problem. Keep your head up and dont give up. This being said I totally understand how you feel.

Should I actively burn the comb debris? What about the hive bodies? It looks to me as if those should be reusable.I saw something about making a trapgt Take a  litre plastic pop bottle and drill a  inch hole just below the slope on the neck then add  cup water  cup sugar  half cup vinegar and finally  banana peel. Wait a few days till it starts to ferment then tie it into a tree close to the hives. This trap will draw the wax moth they enter the hole cant get out and drown in the liquid this will even draw in and kill the bald faced hornet.I had some bald faced hornets sniffing around late summer as well.

7331161,0,t3_4fr0ca,My first comment is that a Deep full of honey weighs lbs enjoy picking that up.Second the question is if you want to force them to have a large brood nest or allow them to. Now this sounds like semantics but its an important distinction. If you place the deep between the current ones then you have empty comb between two blocks of brood comb. This means one of two things will happen  There is no queen! and one box will raise a second queen.  This empty area is brood comb! your workers will build comb the queen will lay in it and all three boxes will be producing brood. Things to be aware of in situation   Youll likely have additional queens working together as a motherdaughter set and youll have run into the revelation that you may have many queens working in unison.  If youre not prepared to be on top of the situation they may swarm on you not once but closer to  times have nuc boxes available. Large hives produce large quantities of honey but they can also be unruly like the difference between a rebellious teenager and a cranky old man who just does what he wants.In the situation where we instead allow them to have a large brood nest you can simply place the box on top and let them naturally exclude the queen with their honey stores. This means your hives no longer need excluders and that the broodnest will grow and shrink as the hive prefers reaching their maximum area near the height of the season.When the hive begins to shrink brood cells in the outer region are filled with honey and winter stores are achieved. I still recommend having a queen excluder there are certain things youll want it for like a queen shake or forcing a skittish hive to stay in their hive.,Beekeeping,d2bi48k,3,t5_2qtzm

7344059,0,t3_4fwn10,From the conditions you described it was cleansing flights. New hives usually have k bees each about lbs. As you said they havent really gotten to go out and hit the bathroom in  days.With robbing youll see confused bees looking for entrances theyre looking for by smell. Youll also see multiple instances of guard bees actually fighting other bees. Its not unusual to have a thief here and there who gets caught so if you see one being fought with dont worry about it.If youre concerned reduce your entrance you can use things like a wood shim or block of wood. We recently had someone make a reducer to size with LEGO bricks.Dont worry too much about the syrup as long as youre not splashing it on the hive. Turn over the jar beside the hive so it reaches a vacuum and then place it in the feeder. If youre really fussed about robbing I use top feeders for syrup and front feeders for water.

7911498,0,t3_4nmo6k,I think I can share some knowledge! I just completed my honours in graphic design where I chose pollinators as my focus I would like to start off by asking what is the project for? and when you say complex products is that marketing or an actual product like bee friendly seed packets?I did a lot of research in the background of what is effecting bees and pollinators and it comes down to multiple interacting causes. I made an info graphic to demonstrate the causes and solutions for bees. Its biggest problem are parasitesdeceases such as the  verroa mite which is one of the biggest stressor for bees at the moment. The mite is effecting every nation of beekeepers expect for Australia thanks to their very strict regulations on importing bees. But they have their own deceases and problems to deal with. The mite was intact recently named a manmade problem as the distribution and exporting of bees spread it which has killed off many native bees as they didnt have millions of years to evolve with it as their Asian pollinators did as well as not having a beekeeper use string and harmful chemicals in the hives. This is for honeybees in particular as I dont know if it effects bumblebees.Combine that with monoculture which means that vast areas are used for one crop that need pollinating is past its season there is NO FOOD left creating a food desert. Also monoculture means that any other food sources such as wildflowers and weeds that provide vital and diverse food for pollinators is limited or gone completely making a flowerless landscape. Climate change is also effecting bees not so much the rise in temperature but the wet summers and sudden changes in climate which effect the flowers as well as the bees. Zealous use of pesticides as well not only in mass agriculture but in household gardens which effect bees as well. In a provence of china where pesticides killed off pollinators apple farmers have to pollinate by hand. For solutions in my project I promoted planting bee friendly flowers as well. I also made an effort to convert urban environments and unitise them into pollinator friendly havens. Currently I have been successful with one and working on a second area I outlined the solutions as followedPlant bee friendly flowers that are native to your area.dont contaminate these flowers with pesticidesBuy honey from local beekeepers to help grow the local pollinators population.See a bee in need help out by giving it sugar water NOT honey as in the uk where I am the shop bought honey is mostly imported which isnt good for native bees. Make beebaths which are small shallow ponds that have stones in them giving a base for the bees to land and get water. Make bee hotels to provide shelter and nests for solitaire bees. Through my own research I found that bees make up rd of our food we consume which I visualised as out of every rd forkful of food you eat it is dependent on pollination someway or another. Also of the top  crops that make up  of our diet  is pollinated. Not only that but soy beans are pollinated witch its biggest use is processed for its protein and its fats which is used in animal feed. No bees  less food for animals  less for us to consume  bye bye meats and dairy. As well as saying goodbye to fruits nuts seeds and vegetables. Not only farmers and the consumers suffer but so will native plants and flowers which need pollination to reproduce meaning we will be left with a barren landscape and boring diet. some useful things to look at would be this TED talk and this video I would also suggest watching this documentary which is on netflix if you have but Im sure you can find it online to watch as well.Let me know if I can help you out more  as I would like to know more about your project   just finished my course and have so much research into this topic I can share which you could just PM me.

8015786,0,t1_d4h111m,Location of QCs does not mean anything. They are tendencies not absolutes. Swarm cells tend to be on the bottom and drawn out as queen cells from the start. But they can be constructed on the sides and even in the middle of a frame if a queen cup had an egg in it. Both boxes being near full promotes that this is a swarm cell but I would expect to see more.Emergency cells tend to be wherever there were eggslarva and start as normal cells then get extended. But if the hive was starting to build swarm cells had an egg in them and the old queen died those swarm cells become emergency ones. There should be brood if its an emergency they took existing brood fed it better and accelerated its growth to produce a queen.Do you see eggs? When was the last time you were in the hive? This cell must be at least  days old since its capped. You say there is larva of all ages but I see nothing but capped brood and some older larva the angle isnt great however.Is there more than the one? If they were swarming there would be more than one. If they are desperate to replace the queen there would be more than one they dont want to take chances on failure. Supercedure is not uncommon as the nectar flow winds down. She might be there and not be doing as well as they would like. If it really is only the once cell that is likely what they are doing.What is the history of this hive? Looking at a single queen cell doesnt say a lot.One frame of the medium is brood? So you have  possible frames the sides of two boxes and the bottom the queen could be on. Look for her again.Normally at  full yes you should add another super. ,Beekeeping,d4h1rtd,2,t5_2qtzm

Its not pleasant for anyone involved you or the bees as some of the commenters express but it works.There are other ways.If its a small swarm hive them. Once they spread out over the comb it should be easier to find her than in the cluster. If they are in a cluster you can often hold a frame of drawn comb up to them and a bunch will crawl on to it.Once your arm is tired put that frame in a hive box off to the side. Use the next frame the same way. Its slow its time consuming but it gives you a chance to see the queen as she crawls onto a frame without the stress of a filter box.,Beekeeping,d4n63e9,1,t5_2qtzm

8539990,0,t1_d6923mc,gtdo you think constant feeding can lead to a robbing mindsetNo. There are several things it can do related to robbing but not a mindset. The first danger is using entrance feeders. With the sugar water at the entrance its to easy for foragers from other hives to find it and start robbing the hive being fed as once they start on the sugar water they proceed into the hive and its stores.The second is that constant feeding can cause a hive to build up stronger than surrounding hives like ones that shut down because of lack of resources. This can lead to the fed hive being the robber going after weaker hives in the area. This is likely what they were talking about. The solution is to keep all the hives equally strong. Swapping brood frames from strong into weak or even shaking bees as needed and reducing entrances of weak hives. The problem here isnt necessarily the feeding its the difference in strong vs weak hives. Strong hives will rob weak hives regardless of feeding if they can.,Beekeeping,d692eu0,2,t5_2qtzm

8756626,0,t3_500mxi,Adopting a hive. This is a service in which you essentially buy a hive or part of one and give it to a beekeeper. You can get updates some honey etc. for some money and not a lot of effort.You can also host hives for other beekeepers who need a place to set some hives. This will mean opening up your land to some people that will require your permission and setting up some agreed upon rules between you.Your own hives in relation to honeybees lacking any semblance of maintenance is just a recipe for being a nuisance and a disaster. Even hiring a personal beekeeper is a better idea.Now you could go with solitary bees like Mason and Leafcutter bees who require quite a bit less maintenance and more just need a home. Mason bees require access to a mud source leafcutters require a leaf source.It should be mentioned that honeybees take about half an hour per hive per week to be maintained. If you can find a half hour or an hour should you have two hives sometime in the middle of the day once a week you should be fine. If you cant manage that then I definitely suggest the options above.,Beekeeping,d708j7k,4,t5_2qtzm

If you are taking all of the frames then there is a good chance you will have the queen. Use a smoker perhaps a spray bottle with sugar water to stop any extra flying around. Cut out all the comb and afix to wooden frames with twine or metal wire. You will know pretty shortly into the process whenif you get the queen. The bees will stop circling the eaves and go towards the box instead. This happens fairly rapidly.As far as getting stung wear some protective gear and use the smoker to create barriers.

11211455,0,t1_df2rcdm,I would agree with reading or watching videos is a great way to get started gathering information. Start by going to YouTube search  Michael Bush I find his lazy bee keeping method extremely helpful for new Beekeepers. Bush bee Farms The practical beekeeper bee keeping naturally. If you live in the Northern hemisphere its probably too late to get started for the season. But you should have plenty of time to plan exactly what youre going to do for next year or five years. Local bee keeping clubs are an additional source of great information they are better able to provide you with specific beekeeping advice for your area. They also the best place to get survivor stock local bees. If you can build the bee boxes yourself frames are relatively inexpensive to buy and put together so it can certainly be done on a shoestring budget. The time required can vary greatly depending on how much you want to spend. Some people check a hive twice a year other beekeepers I know I check it every two weeks. So it depends largely on you once you establish colonies the bees are perfectly capable of taking care of themselves remember nobody checks the hive that lives in in the tree down the road. As far as children near a hive I feel children are perfectly safe as long as they cant be kept from actually touching the hive. I have a hive about  feet from my house but its in a corner of the yard that nobody ever really goes so nobody disturbs them. TLDR search Michael bush on YouTube ,Beekeeping,df2t0hp,2,t5_2qtzm
11244208,0,t3_60gi5d,I think you will be fine I would guess thats towards the end of the spring flow so youll definitely need to check them before going in the winter to make sure there are plenty of stores. You should definitely be getting some local survivor stock thats probably why hes pushing you till late May. I would be mildly concerned about the price thats far cheaper that I usually pay for a nuc.

11254791,0,t1_df7jv3a,Sure there is. Use double queen excluders to keep them separate and stop them killing each other through the queen excluder. You just have to make sure that none of the queens move into a different section during your weekly inspections. At some stage youll fail to find a single queen cell during the weekly inspection of the hypothetical  brood frames in your hive. Then youll have a swarm of  bees taking off all at once.

11309616,0,t3_61aahy,I take off excess honey frames at this point and store them.The bees will often work harder if theres less stores and also if the hive space is smaller it makes it easier for the bees to keep it warm raise brood etc.The frames then get reused later in the year  for boosting weak colonies during the UK June gap making up nucs or as an alternative to feeding syrup in the autumn.Ive never bothered extracting this honey  old and pollen filled frames often make for darker bitter honey which isnt worth trying to sell.,Beekeeping,dfdxerv,3,t5_2qtzm

11622674,0,t1_dgde7fm,Thanks!  Sadly I dont know anyone close enough Id be confident theyre in my drone zone.  My local association is mostly rural Im one of very few urban beeks and most of the others are just now getting their hives.  They have a very churchlike culture where theres an old guard thats very traditionalist and they dont do a very good job with retention of the younger beeks.  I was probably due to learn this lesson last year but them both swarming gave me a year hahaha. I got an outside queen last year that is doing beautifully so Ill see if they have one.  With two hives its a marginal cost and with the honey I already have I dont think that will be an issue.  If money was an issue this year itd be the supers Im thinking Im going to have to buy to keep up.  I thought three each would be enough to rotate out on them but theyve both filled one in two weeks time and clover and locust havent even bloomed yet. ,Beekeeping,dgdfw4p,2,t5_2qtzm
