If youre in a small town you can see what kinds of eventsclasses are available to youmeet your interests. If you dont find any that are interesting to you you can start your own club and invite the general public to attend  that would kill two birds with one stone meet new people and youd have something to do maybe on a weekend. Im  and I had to move away from my small city to a metropolis to go after my goals and dreams but that also meant leaving behind my comforts from home and my childhooduniversity friends. You just gotta look your fears in the eye and know that through active participation in your own life that youll be fine and even have some fun along the way. ,quarterlifecrisis,chkqrcn,1,t5_2zkkt

3110202,0,t3_2vqtnj,I have two major problems as I see it. One can be worked out I think and the other is beyond repair  Im having a lot of trouble with is finding a job that I dont end up disliking after a few months and hold it. Ive graduated in the end of  and had an internship and two jobs. The intership lasted only  months instead of the usual  mostly because the company which hired me went through financial troubles.In the first job I lasted about a year. I absolutely hated that job. I fucking spend four years on a Computer Science degree and they put me do work on something a trained chimp could do. But hey it paid the bills and my Steam games so I ended up enduring it.My second job was last year and lasted about  months. It wasnt half as bad as the previous one and paid almost twice as much. My living expenses also doubled since I moved to a bigger city but I still had more money at the end of the month. The routine though was much more stressful and they ended up firing me because I couldnt meet their demands. It was sort of a good thing though since after six months in I was starting to break both physically and mentally.Now Im unemployed and living with my parents so Im taking the time to get my driving license and the money Ive saved according to my estimates can last me from  to  years if I spend it wisely.  I have too much of a hot temper. Ive been worse when I was younger Im  now now I can endure a bit longer before exploding. And when I do I can be just a bit too foul. Ive done enough of that for my dad to tell me this happened yesterday that if he ever gets old enough to need someone to take care of him hes gonna move to some retirement home because hes not crazy enough to ever be under my care. My mom never says anything because well a mother who loves his son will forgive pretty much everything and boy does it make me feel like ber crap. I used to have my doubts but now Im fully sure Im completely overstaying my welcome in this house and that they support me out of obligation for being my parents instead of truly loving me. Sure they still say they love me but I dont feel like I deserve it anymore. Im feeling like complete shit and I know Im to blame for that. I dont even feel like apologizing because it would be pointless because if they still love me at least my mom will forgive me because she loves me not because I deserve to be forgiven also because I know that no matter how many times I apologize Im gonna slip and act like a fucking asshole over and over.,quarterlifecrisis,cokdd8w,1,t5_2zkkt
