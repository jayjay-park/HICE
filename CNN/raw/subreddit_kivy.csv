10755238,0,t1_ddp3yup,So...  I found out why calling idle doesnt work.It turns out that the inputs are added to the event queue in a routine called mainloop in kivy.core.window.windowXXX  depending on what system you are running on.  Coincidentally mainloop calls idle!   So idle will dispatch events but mainloop is what puts events into the event list for idle to process.  Without mainloop putting events into the queue calling idle is useless !To make this work you have to call mainloop not idle. The documentation is a bit misleading in this regard but the authors probably never intended idle and mainloop to be used outside their classes any either.Open Source rocks as usual !,kivy,ddpblff,1,t5_2u95x
10976434,0,t1_dec44t8,KivEnt does not use Pymunk it has an alternative cython based wrapper called cymunk. KivEnt does however contain a significant amount of code designed to avoid the overhead of Python datastructures. The renderers have an automated batching algorithm to help optimize draw calls in conditions where you are rendering lots of sprites such as the tile issue. The main goal of KivEnt is to allow you to build games in python without having all the overhead related to Python data structures. It has a significant amount of features to allow you to make use of these optimizations with a minimal amount of having to get your hands dirty with C level code.  Its got thousands of lines of code related to solving various game tasks all with a consistent and easy to use architecture that makes sure you have a good separation of concerns and are prepared for possibly moving code from Python to Cython. It is designed to be modular so you dont need to bring in a physics engine if you dont need phsyics and thus you dont need to fuck with compilation of more libs etc base kivent has all the same dependencies as kivy so there is no additional compilation overhead compared to just building a game with kivy.KivEnt will give you a scheme for managing game data that scales much better than any Python based solution you will be able to come up with and an ever growing library of features built around this scheme so that you can easily add support for particles physics tiled and other common game needs.,kivy,dec62fj,1,t5_2u95x
11322015,0,t1_dffaxdu,It seemed that kv language is more precise than python maybe I should forget the pygame rules.  for my purpose  I think I should change the size and delta move distance like this.    from kivy.base import runTouchApp    from kivy.lang import Builder    runTouchAppBuilder.loadstring    BoxLayout        orientation vertical        RelativeLayout            Widget                id player                sizehint None None                canvas                    Color                        rgba                        Rectangle                        pos self.pos                        size root.size.root.size.        BoxLayout            Button                text left                onpress player.x    root.size.            Button                text right                onpress player.x    root.size.    something like that. but I still confused about the player.pos here. say if I set the pos in Line  just change self.pos into   then  when I press the button nothing happens why? and I want to change the self.pos into window pos what should I do say I change the line  to  like this                Rectangle                     import Widget kivy.uix.widget.Widget                    pos Widget.towindowself.pos.self.pos.                    size root.size.root.size.it raise error.,kivy,dffbxmz,1,t5_2u95x
