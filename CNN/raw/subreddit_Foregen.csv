7742190,0,t1_d3m67y0,It baffles me that so little feminists bring light to the subject of circumcision? We are literally being mutilated at birth here and no one bats an eye. For crying out loud we are seen as over exaggerated and obsessed people. So much for modern feminism striving for equality in both genders... ,Foregen,d3m8bin,1,t5_34ily
8395663,0,t3_4ujo7y,It really is just a matter of time before this kind of procedure is readily available. All we need to do here for is to make it happen faster. ,Foregen,d5r06m7,3,t5_34ily
8419824,0,t1_d5tyul1,Indeed and with them on the job too I really am hopeful.  With all of the organizations and researchers working in this field its going to be interesting to see all of the results and successes they have.  As well as Foregen of course!  I think when the time comes in the future they could potentially have a really awesome partnership and help end this practice in America.,Foregen,d5u0roz,3,t5_34ily
8521911,0,t1_d66qhna,Wow really?  Thats great!  We have ideas for what we can do for a video on Foregen  I can post them here.  Did you see my pm too?uswimmerbd,Foregen,d66stc6,1,t5_34ily
8846580,0,t1_d6ktt29,To give an example of the va I was about to get reconstructive surgery on my sternum because it was compressing my heart. Suddenly the va tried to pass the procedure off as cosmetic because my chest was sunken in. I took a ct scan and saw my sternum was pushing on areas of my heart with about a  inch gap and it still took them about a week to decide to insure the procedure. So from my point of view there is no chance in hell the va will ever gain the common courtesy to help people financially on getting their foreskin back. ,Foregen,d7b8f0s,1,t5_34ily
9010867,0,t1_d7qcl3n,I think about this too... Cant they use some regenerative medicine scar treatments in the procedure? I hope so.,Foregen,d7uyrxu,2,t5_34ily
9411302,0,t1_d98nv9m,This is what I came here to say. The drop in donations will be made up for in the future as Foregen starts collecting funds from investors in the digit range. The one thing holding them back was a lack of published research but that will be accomplished soon as they finish the decellularization experiment.,Foregen,d98y5ol,3,t5_34ily

10231475,0,t3_5mhx2l,No problem with ranting at all. Its disgusting what was done to us. And have you brought it up to your parents to let them know how angry you are about it?,Foregen,dc3smoq,6,t5_34ily
10429565,0,t3_5n858o,Eric was doing great until he started blasting older Americans delusions and his threat to make sure the younger generation knows the truth. That rhetoric belongs at a rally where youre preaching to the choir not in a meeting of angel investors whose penises you just dismantled. That dismantling was pitchperfect and smooth even compassionate in its bluntness. But the toopredictable switch into raging against the machine ruined Erics landing. That entire section shouldve been dropped. The only investors willing to join forces with such rhetoric would have to be militant themselves and Im guessing none of them are.,Foregen,dcq9dlb,1,t5_34ily
10690598,0,t1_ddil9m9,Could I theoretically just wear a sleeve every day? It probably sounds really stupid to people but Id rather go through that hassle and then get the real thing done instead of having to recircumcise ,Foregen,ddinmz2,2,t5_34ily
10703062,0,t1_ddjwsdm,I really dont see how it would be any different having the foregen procedure with a tight cut as opposed to a man who has restored which would just be essentially a loose cut. ,Foregen,ddjxwax,1,t5_34ily
10721088,0,t1_ddl22vg,Well that depends. Someone will legally own that technology. So you couldnt just take it and make a lot of money from it. At best you would have to buy the tech i.e. the company to do that. Most likely if someone had the money to buy the tech they have plans to make money off of it and do something with it that wasnt in its original intention. ,Foregen,ddlsuew,1,t5_34ily
