540331,0,t3_20brn0,gt Is the Art Institute THAT BAD?short answer depends! for me best decision ever!  long answer I went there. You get out of it what you put into it... like anything. I had classmates who went on to be sous at very good restaurants. A few work for the huge chains. Plenty went back to their old jobs and others that do nothing with their degree. One girl I went to school with works in retail clothing and doesnt hardly cook at home anymore but she is still one of my very best friends. The instructors are for the most part great. There are LOTS of people who seem to attend that dont really want to be there.  The big scandal about that place was that if you qualified for govt scholarships youd get accepted. Its rather expensive. The rumors I heard was that AI gave the appearance that it existed to collect the grant money that students could get from government programs.  I already had a degree so I didnt qualify for much. They did give me a lot of earnedcredit for my previous college work so I didnt have to take as many classes as my peers. I only had to take the culinary classes no historymathcomputeretc. classes which I hear you dont get out of any more.I am certain that I would not have gotten a foot into the culinary world if I hadnt attended AICLA.  I say this because Im over  married had no BOH experience and already had a college degree and Im a woman. I doubt any of the chefs here to say that theyd let someone with that background into their kitchens to start from the ground up. I could barely get anyone to let me stage. ...but when I did it was Ortolan with Eme! but the hours cut too deep and since I already had a life I wasnt prepared to give that up. I did catering jobs instead which were much more flexible and grew into creating my own business from there. I wouldnt be where I am today if I hadnt gone so IMHO best decision ever.,Chefit,cg1oxku,9,t5_2s1da

2551748,0,t3_2oxp8y, Find and utilize some kind of rhythm when you prep. Start slowly and really develop solid techniques. Learn what you can from reading and watching YouTube. Could you learn everything on the job? Well probably...but you have a whole world of culinary info at your finger tips just begging to be seen.   If the kitchen doesnt have a good sharp knife you can get a hold of regularly consider investing some of your first paycheck into a knife of your own. A Victorinox  Chefs knife is inexpensive and durable and according to a lot of chefs just as capable as many of the more expensive knives out there. It might seem trivial but a sharp knife can make a word of difference for a prep cook. Respect all your superiors and anybody whos worked there longer than you even if you hate their guts. No one cares who you are. No one cares what you know. Everyone cares about what you can do and how fastprecisely you can do it. Beyond that being someone that is enjoyable to work will earn you a lot of points.  When approached by superiors your only real answers should be Yes or No. Hopefully your managers and head chefs will be good to you. Many arent. However they sign the paychecks and as long as thats happening theyre probably right despite how wrong they truly are. Swallow any pride you have in the beginning and stick to proving yourself as a worker in the beginning. It really can payoff. Develop a taste for sarcasticdrymeangrossperverted tomfoolery.

The key here is taking it with grace write down the proper procedure and never make the same mistake again. Chef will almost always forgive a novice who makes an honest mistake he will be a lot less forgiving the second time around.Also taste everything. No sauce soup side or vinegarette should see a customer without a tasting spoon through it. Keep your standards high.Lastly if a fellow cook offers you a taste of something take it. Even if you think you wont like it it develops your palette increases your knowledge and  you might just come around to foods you thought you didnt like.

7414865,0,t1_d2kvfn6,True this is a pan sauce and it takes zero time to make but there are alternatives albeit not perfect or exact but it will get you close.If you are doing a plate up of  scampi plates you are not going to do a pan sauce because by the time it hits the dining room table it is going to be garbage. By going a similar route you can make and hold a scampi sauce that requires little other than tossing and final seasoning. This is of course you know how do it. Being a shoemaker and using a heavy roux white sauce with lemon and herbs in it isnt going to cut it.It depends on the chef. If the saut guy has an idea to speed up service make it up and run it past the chef. If it gets his blessing then do it. Otherwise pan sauce it is. Personally I would do it in the pan. However if you can make a quality butter sauce by the quart and have it withstand the steam table you can easily do this.Ive made at the request of an exec chef at a country club I was working at a faux Sauce Barnaise to be used on the hot line of a buffet.

9402969,0,t3_59egpw,Congratulations! My wife and I self catered our wedding last year and it worked out really well but there are definitely a lot of traps you need to watch out for.The number one piece of advice I would give is to try and get some outside help for serving food and clearing everything up. After the ceremony you are probably going to be emotionally overwhelmed and everyone is going to want to talk to you. Guests can be helpful but theyre also easily distracted and are there to enjoy themselves as well. This can be tough on your budget but we got around this by hiring some teenage piano students my mum teaches. We also managed to get a food and beverage manager in for the day from a local hotel where we used to work  and he was an absolute lifesaver there are always going to be a few hiccups and having someone else to quietly deal with them will save you a lot of stress on an already stressful day. Maybe you dont have any food and beverage connections but it doesnt hurt to ask around.Food wise you have done well to keep things simpleish but I think you have too many hot options that are too sensitive to overcooking. I would suggest maybe replacing the mac and cheese with a stew or something else that can be made weeks before and frozen. We did an oxtail stew with panko crumb that was defrosted the night before  re heated in  rice warmers just before we left for the ceremony.Maybe it doesnt suit the theme of your wedding but we found that dips which can be prepped up to a week before we did hommus tzatziki and a pumpkin dip are a good way to fill people up with minimum effort. You also havent mentioned quantities yet. When I asked this same question on kitchenconfidential I received a fantastic series of replies from a caterer which I will link to below. The rough guide she gave me to work off was thisgt For your mains. Work on g of protein g starch potato rice pasta whatever and about g of veg per person plus  as a contingency. For dessert each portion should ve approximately a volume of . cups. After  courses people are always stuffed full. They dont want a massive plate. And generally at weddings they have been drinking a bit so they eat even less.Are you buying disposable cutlery and plates for the wedding? We used sugar cane and bamboo ones as they are a lot nicer than the plastic stuff. For wine glasses we found buying them actually worked out cheaper than renting so now we have  spare wine glasses kicking around PWho takes care of the washing up? The venue?Prep times This may be something you already know but youre going to need a very clear idea of what needs to be cooked on what day. Break every task down and do them in bulk trying to find as much overlap between the mise of each recipe as possible. If you have family helping out its good to coordinate with them exactly how much food they are preparing and how long they are allocating to do each task. This can be a sensitive topic but if someone is prepping a crucial item you will need backups should something go wrong. The more kitchens the higher chance for problems. The ovens If you can try do a trial run of every dish the day before. Rental ovens can be a bit temperamental especially the non electric gas ones and you dont want to have to be thinking too much about each dish coming out right on the day. Edit Another really important thing to think about is the logistics of  people all trying to get food around the same time. If you possibly can try and have  or even more separate tables with identical setups or at the least have some side tables with cold starters so people arent waiting a long time to eat.,Chefit,d97w5rd,7,t5_2s1da

If you use this like a roadmap to improvement then you can easily improve and your bosses can see that you are meeting the goals they set you and the goals you set yourself.  It will get you more raises and let you move up. One of the biggest pluses in working in the hotel part of the industry is the Ability to move somewhere new with a better job.

Not sure how to put a link while Im on mobile but google cake ring and it comes up with some on amazon! They arent sharp but you can use them to cut shapes for the most part. At work we make sheet pans of cakes and cut out different sizes with the cake rings depending how big we need at the time. You can also easily assemble cakes in the rings as well. Line the inside of the ring with acetate put your layers or cakefilling. Freeze pull ring off take off acetate and there you go!

Blocked off the walkin both freezers all our outdoor space and every available prep surface we had left right as lunch started. I feel your pain,Chefit,dbtpyfh,1,t5_2s1da

10720931,0,t3_5sp0a6,Owner amp chef here. I have two partners and we have  places with a fourth on the way. One of my partners is the money guy. Handles finances legal insurance compliance etc. Love having him on board. he focuses amp handles a lot of the stuff I have no interest in so I can do what I love amp am good at which is run the restaurants. I handle operations. If a guest touches it I am involved. From booze selections to the type of paper we print menus on and everything in between. We have chef de cuisines amp GMs in each restaurant who handle daytoday operations. Our job is to assist amp coach them. I think my role is to provide our chefs amp managers with all the tools necessary to do their job help them remove any barriers they might face and push them to be always improving. When we opened our nd place I was not only chef but GM. That was tough but I had a good handle on it. Going from  to  was really difficult for me. I am not in the kitchen any more amp I honestly miss it. I have more freedom but I dont feel as connected to the life of the restaurants as I would like. I have had to reinvent myself and that hasnt been easy. I spent  years learning to run a kitchen amp now I am learning to be a restauranteur amp business owner. While the skill sets intersect there has been a big learning curve for me. I often wish for the simplicity of running one restaurant again....I am in the restaurants  days a week. Meetings updates working with chefs on menus beverage directors on booze lists and interacting with staff amp guests. Now I am leading the opening of our latest project which I love. My partners amp I are all working owners in that we are in the restaurants every day and like to be a part of what is going on. I spend the majority of my time working on the business rather than in the business but I try amp remain relevant amp connected at all our places.,Chefit,ddls9fq,2,t5_2s1da

10895832,0,t1_de2ln1x,No ones too old for sexism in the kitchen haha. Can be hard to move up if your boss thinks youre inconsistent cuz HORMONES AMIRITE and doesnt like the way you call chits back because youre a harpy or whatever. It can be rough some times trying to figure out if someone is actually sexist or if you just suck but its something to keep your ear on the ground for. Just a heads up theres a lot of ageism. Its an industry that rides you hard physically. Its hard enough on the young I have crippling back pain and I am not  yet. The young and talented grind and grind until they get to a cushy chef gig. The rest burn out because of the long hours and hard work. You might not move as fast as everyone else and you need to be prepared for how youll handle that. ,Chefit,de3tt1c,2,t5_2s1da

If he did that then its all on them for being retarded.

Depending on how your place operates i.e. you use an orderfire system or just fire everything approach. When marking fish it is helpful to mark one side of the fish to obtain the  or quadrille marking the remove the fish and transfer it to a sizzle pan saut pan pie pan ect to finish in the oven. This way you can better time your plate.Steaks too. RareMed get marked then removed anything over med stays on the grill but moved to a cooler spot so you do not burn a giant char onto the bottom. Sometimes with a large filet it will get put onto a sizzle platter and shoved to the back of the oven until it is called. Once ready to place then finish on the grillbroileroven.Once the plate is read for service finish in the broileroven. The salamander and broiler will give a nice brown crust depending on how strong the heat is.Fish is easy to tell the doneness by looking for the white protein or albumen rising through the meat. If the meat is opaque it is done. If it is clear it is not.,Chefit,dftm0st,2,t5_2s1da

11724548,0,t3_66qc9r,I went to culinary school and feel it really helped me   I was a career changer who wasnt into spending years on the line earning very little and wanted to be heavily qualified and knowledgeable ASAP my school was a mo program. Now I run my own business yrs out of school while other people in my graduating class are exec. chefs and exec sous chefs. I would talk to chefs and cooks at the restaurants you would want to work at though some chefs want to hire graduates who have a broad knowledge base and can adapt that to their kitchens others want to hire those who have a resume that shows diversity who they can teach specific techniques to. ,Chefit,dgp0an6,2,t5_2s1da
