11745538,0,t3_5wsix9, FULL War CabalGrand Coven. A purist potentially competitive list.  Summons  Daemons a turn.  Relatively safe summoning thanks to Grand Coven. Extraordianrily reliable summoning thanks to Spell Familiars just roll  dice at each summoning and youll get it. Extremely tanky thanks to War Cabal.   BASE Psyker dice. Amazing melee because of Maulerfiend and an absolute buttload of Daemons.  Okay shooting because Thousand Sons are okay at shooting.pts free at the end so I added the Athanaen Scrolls to give a sure fire unstoppable summoning in case of AntiPsyker stuff.,ThousandSons,dgrdx7b,1,t5_3hve2
