1604265,0,t3_2ckli1,Look I cannot believe I have to say this but no one really hires here. I posted here a few days ago. I havent got a single case from there but in that period I fought about seven cases and I think won  at least partially. You kind of need to understand that you need a bit of reputation you need to win some cases first. I suggest even though Im not affiliated that you go to riolpioandBanana and see if they want to hire you.,KarmaCourtAttorneys,cjhdwl6,1,t5_2vwjk

2428843,0,t1_cmbwepz,I tend to agree with you.  If there was more activity i think KCA could have use.  But its simply not there.  The only way we could boost in my mind is to hire a LARGE mod staff so that you and I could assign tasks to so that it all gets done and we dont get stuck with it all.,KarmaCourtAttorneys,cmbwudn,1,t5_2vwjk
