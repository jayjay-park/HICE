667057,0,t3_21r3as, This was a great concern for me as well when I was applying to wake. Wake gets one or two wellknown acts play at the Joel each year. Weve had Wiz Steve Aoki Tiesto Elton John...but those are few and far between. All of the good live music is usually in Asheville  hr drive and sometimes at the Cats Cradle near UNC  hr drive. Ziggys downtown is a decent scene on occasion as well. That being said there are plenty of musicians on campus for such a small school and I dont think you will have a problem getting your name out there.  The average dorm room is pretty shitty but if you are lucky you will end up in one of the new dorms. Additionally something that I did not consider as an incoming freshman was the  year residency requirement. Do not underestimate this...it is a very long time to live in a very small place.Uhh the best thing about Wake in my opinion is the academic atmosphere and how accessible your teachers will be for oneonone helpthis is hugebecause they will always be at least in my experience trying to help you succeed. But maybe you expected to hear that...,wfu,cgg3dmc,1,t5_2sj2l
