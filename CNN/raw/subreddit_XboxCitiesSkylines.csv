11707824,0,t3_671j9m,Heres a fantastic guide to traffic flow   Remember the road hierarchy from left to right on your roads menu. lane roads  one ways feed into lanes  avenues and run through neighborhoods. Avenues and sixlane roads collect traffic and express route them to the arteries of your main highway. Plan for some expansion! Its hard to do but thinking this is gonna be a main road should notify you that you want to leave room to upgrade the road later and NOT TO ZONE DIRECTLY ON IT!  Dont forget about tunnelsbridges! Its not always appropriate for roads to intersect. Going above or below other roads can really help your traffic flow! The larger your road the more complex your intersections. The larger roads utilize traffic lights which can can actually be worse on traffic congestion. Because of this you dont want to group intersections too near each other  I generally rule  or so units away from one another at least got this from YT ImperialJedi Roundabouts are a great way to keep traffic moving but arent effective for very heavy intersections. I generally use them for intersections of avenues or lane roads. Speaking of roundabouts getting a properly circular one can be a royal pain.  Especially in the case of bringing one ways together. Theres two methods that can help When bringing four square roads together    the roundabout will sometimes force an oval or odd shape due to elevation etc. By building a one way or two lane road bisecting your roundabout the game will force it to square up. You can remove the road once your actual intersecting roads are connected to retain the shape. When creating a round about with one ways create a full hashtag    with the roads. Then delete the inner box so you have  roads all pointing at one another. Then use the curve tool to connect each corner to another. The game will create a roundabout for you. If someone has images showing this method please reply! Im on mobile  Trying to match up roads but the sections you delete just wont match up? Create an intersecting road where you want them to match or near it and youll be able to delete each road to the intersection and now theyre in line! Especially useful with highways. Even early on its a smart idea to have a separate access to your highway or artery for the industry. Industry causes heavy truck traffic which can cause noise and congestion through your residential areas. Also oneways are great to use in industrial areas. Just make sure to pair one ways so your services can get in! Avenues and oneway roads are a burden to firepoliceambulancetrash service. Avoid putting your services directly on them and note that these roads can limit their effective range. Plan accordingly! Roads are the only thing in the game you cant move but dont let that discourage you from deleting and trying again. Its not unusual to have intersections or even neighborhoods that work at first and just dont later on.Thats probably enough for now. ,XboxCitiesSkylines,dgn418t,10,t5_3k3hq
