8828231,0,t3_50zc4k,Adams Morgan is good for nightlife although dont know about Sunday and weeknights. The zoo and a lot of museums are free. Ive heard good things about Archibalds. The Warner kind of sucks unless you are on the lower level. Always find it funny because there are always people with balloons on the street outside. Have fun I may try to scoop some floor tickets for one night,WidespreadPanic,d7913vd,1,t5_2rtvm
