Plus they have a bouldering wall which makes for a great alternative workout on days when you dont feel like doing a circuit.,Hoboken,cothx3c,2,t5_2rni6

4077029,0,t3_378now,I rank food by how I feel after eating great clean satisfied versus great while eating but awful after.Tier  Frans salads are generous come with a lot of toppings and still under  if you add chicken. Their sandwiches are all under  as well not to mention they have a daily lunch special. Matt amp Meera has great food under  but smaller portions. Their naan pizza and their tomato chutney are both awesome.Tier  Mamouns rice plate with a pita will definitely fill you up because youre eating all carbs. Bancock City has a lunch special thats more affordable and less busy than T Thai  the specials are pre made and served and you can choose from meat noodles veggies etc.Tier  Havana Cafe has a lunch special any sandwich and one draft for .. Decent but never blown away occasionally disappointed. After one terrible buffalo chicken wrap experience with Mr. Wraps I always stuck to bacon cheeseburgers over wraps and was generally OK but always felt like a rock after. I think you can get a burger at the place that wraps everything in pancakes thats ok as well.,Hoboken,crl09y5,1,t5_2rni6

I was able to get a place in a relatively high end building but we pay around  per month so its very expensive. Also you should consider parking cost if you need a garage my roommate pays somewhere around  a month to park. Street will be cheaper but availability can be spotty.,Hoboken,dd7fscc,2,t5_2rni6

11666227,0,t1_dghueoc,Have you seen the pictures Leo?This isnt a building that is out of scale with the surrounding buildings and reasons why we have zoning boards. They should be able to make a decision that makes sense and this no matter how you cut it makes no sense. The building is beautiful they only wanted  parking spots.

Nastasi has also posted the following on social mediaAs much as I can say and I cant say too much due to the sensitive nature of contract negotiations  which are way above my pay grade the owners have been in a preliminary contractual agreement with Shake Shack as much as you can prior to City Approvals. It was my decision with the Owners approval to go public with their signage on my renderings as part of the zoning board application. Now that we are going back to the drawing board to reconfigure the project and produce design revisions we will obviously have to rethink the economics of the project accordingly  based on the revised project metrics  before we can reengage Shake Shack.,Hoboken,dgkmwp6,0,t5_2rni6

11768984,0,t1_dgtvtap,Well the PATH costs . for a trip. PATH Trip  SmartLink.. So it does cost . more per ride. There is no real justification except the reason why I buy filet mignon vs chuck meat or drink scotch over cheap vodka or drive a Porsche vs a Hyundai. First once you get older you hopefully will have more money. Two you begin to weigh costs differently. While I am frugal in some areas like clothing and shoes and my love of Blimpie sandwiches I will spend the extra money on other luxuries like business class seating over economy seating. The ferry is a luxury class seat for a public transit world. ,Hoboken,dgu1n0m,2,t5_2rni6
