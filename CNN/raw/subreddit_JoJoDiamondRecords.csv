Basically I live at university most of the time and for some reason the game doesnt like it when I use the public wifi on campus.

11477844,0,t3_63sfx2,As a fan of time stopping DIO was disapointing for me since every skill of his that stops time also does an attack an then time flows again giving the player no saying on what to do during that time. But I was later informed that if youre lucky enough to not only get DIO but also ZaWarudos Mind Skill from Gasha you can then JUST stop time and make all enemy attacks USELESS. So theres that.,JoJoDiamondRecords,dfx0d06,3,t5_3il6o
