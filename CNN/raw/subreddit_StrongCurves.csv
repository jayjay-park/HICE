4592518,0,t1_ct8wq5w,Im thinking as soon as I finish reading the book I have yet to recieve it but I should get it in a few days at most so that I start out the program with as much knowledge as possible!Last time I was at the gym I was looking around for a good spot to do the hip thrusts since Ill be needing somewhere that has a barbell some free space and a decently high bench of sorts that wont slide backwards. I also dont really want to carry the barbells away too far from the squat racks and all. I have yet to find the perfect spot.. Will keep my searching and experimenting on this next time I go I want to be fully prepared for all exercises before I start for real! I did research on many of the other exercises and took notes on form and such from videos.,StrongCurves,ct9hbhw,1,t5_36f3j

4723784,0,t1_ctpye5q,I wish I could! I dont know if its partly the awful heat I live in Louisiana or what but Ive always had to eat before a workout cardio or strength. I may add a carb like toast in tomorrow and see if that helps. Thank you!  ,StrongCurves,ctpz10n,1,t5_36f3j

4738862,0,t3_3fscil,I typically do the foam roller section and a couple of the static stretches recommended. I work all day at a desk so I can really feel the difference in my posture and overall looseness when I roll out a bit. Nothing too strenuous though.,StrongCurves,ctrvlpt,2,t5_36f3j

6013669,0,t3_3xp9vz, |  | CW  | BF  Myfitnesspal hemichaelisWhat are your goals for this challenge? I reached my goal weight with cardio and counting calories. I want to increase my fitness level by learning how to strength train and decreasing my body fat. What are your goals for this week? Complete the Strong Curves BW workouts this week. How are you tracking your workouts? Excel Spreadsheet based on the one from the FAQHow are you tracking your other progress? I took starting photos and measurements. What else is going on? How do you feel? Im feeling pretty good but unmotivated to work out. Ive been doing well all year but my husband is currently off work for the next couple of weeks. I think Ill just focus on the SC program this week and put cardio on the back burner until after vacation. Gym Anxiety I chose to start with the body weight program so I could work out at home. I do have a little anxiety about the gym but really I just know from past experience that if I have to drive somewhere several times a week it feels like another errand to be completed.

They do take  min but I do feel warm afterwards....not sure if thats warm from embarrassment or not though Just do what work for you. I second the foam roller and mobility exercises though!,StrongCurves,cy8uyzw,1,t5_36f3j
6021474,0,t3_3xwjxd,I started the Best Butt Home workout before I had the book and after looking at the recommended warmups Ill be sticking with my initial plan. Partly because I finally can remember the exercises and partly because its very similar to the SC warmup minus the static stretches. This is the warmup I do. ,StrongCurves,cy8xt20,3,t5_36f3j

8710918,0,t3_4zasgh,I think I get what youre asking! The only B exercise is the bench press. The other exercises below it deadlifts planks etc are supposed to go after you do squatsbench sets. Definitely work with the dumbbells if thats all you have available. As far as cardio do what you want and what makes your body feel good I do Zumba most days I dont lift. BUT you dont have any rest days in the schedule you posted. Active recovery is great but your body is going to want a break eventually! If you push yourself too hard you risk burning out both physically and mentally. I would consider having at least one rest day. Good luck!,StrongCurves,d6ui1lq,3,t5_36f3j
8926825,0,t1_d7k2mjw,You didnt seem harsh to me at all. I know that spot reduction isnt a thing. And thats pretty much what Im worried about is losing my butt in the process. Im not sure how much of it is fat vs muscle but at my weight Im sure more is fat. LOL,StrongCurves,d7kvfrn,3,t5_36f3j

10173055,0,t3_5llp2u,FWIW Ive done strength training for years and have been quite challenged by BB.  Im in weeks  now and struggling hard.  But my previous experience was primarily dumbbells and I havent lifted heavy in years so YMMV.If you do BB and find it too easy just add some weight to the bodyweight exercises.,StrongCurves,dbx674j,4,t5_36f3j
10181826,0,t3_5lpgs9,Im curious about how important it is to do the foam rolling before your workout vs after. If I do roll which Im really bad at remembering to do  Im working on it though! its usually after my workout. I did actually roll based on the Workout A warm up from the SC book before my workout for the first time and I was surprised to find myself sweating after just rolling out. So I guess I see the benefit there. Anyways ultimately does it really matter when you roll?,StrongCurves,dby601b,4,t5_36f3j

10298209,0,t3_5ngj9x,Do the best you can. If you can do one squat then do just one. Keep doing one and pretty soon you will be able to do two. Same with any of the exercises in the workouts. Do as many as you can. If its one then do one. If its half of one do half of one. Just push your muscles. They will grow. If balance is an issue try doing a squat next to a chair with one hand on the chair. Try not to push on it unless you absolutely have to help yourself back up but that might help balance. On any of them that require dumbbells just use bodyweight at first. Once you can do twelve or whatever number of reps of those then try   or  lb dumbbells. Just dont give up! Keep trying. You will see strength results very soon. ,StrongCurves,dcbcvz9,47,t5_36f3j
