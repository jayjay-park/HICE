282537,0,t3_1xbxzk,The way Go is now if you see p  Person you know its going to create a Person struct and its going to initialize all the fields in that struct to their zero value and that its not going to do anything else. But suppose we take your suggestion. Then someone might write    type Person struct         Name string  nextName    where nextName is an elaborate function that picks a name from a list or something. Now p  Person could be doing anything much like a constructor in C and you dont know what its really doing unless you inspect the definition of Person. Maybe you could mitigate that by limiting what youre allowed to use as default values e.g. stringnumberstruct literals only but it would still add some unnecessary complexity I think.I dont know if its intentional but I think the lack of a default value feature also makes the language feel a little different from other OOP languages I know. Structs in Go are not like classes in other languages. Theyre just chunks of data that you can tack methods onto. No constructors destructors virtual methods abstract methods or subclasses.

917633,0,t3_24m2bc,This doesnt negate the work done in there but Id observe that in most cases the best way to concatenate strings is to not concatenate them in the first place. Most need to concatenate large strings comes from some API having in Golang terms string where it ought to have io.Writer. If possible rather than collecting strings its way more efficient to pass around an io.Writer preferably buffered and simply write the strings out to the target directly rather than collecting them all up front. An io.Writer can be converted to a string fairly easily but a string can not be transparently converted to a stream.As it happens Ive spent the last two days fighting this in a nonGo API and environment pretty hardcoded to string and I lamented the fact that a stream was not an option. So Im pretty keyed up about this right now.  Like I said at the beginning its still good to know the fastest way to do this because sooner or later youll encounter an API that gets it wrong and youll need to know how to deal with it.This incidentally isnt really a Gospecific thing nothing stops most languages from passing around an output stream instead of expecting a string. Its a common APIscalability error in many environments concatenating a few small strings together every so often isnt a problem but it doesnt scale up well and people designing APIs dont always get that.,golang,ch8la28,2,t5_2rc7j

That being said if your package did the right thing with an embedded sync.RWMutex when generating getters and setters it would have been quite useful to me while scaffolding a current project which has a fairly large number of synchronized structures especially if it generated the truly tedious    func s someStruct GetFoo foo string         s.RLock        foo  s.foo        s.RUnlock        return        func s someStruct SetFoofoo string         s.Lock        s.foo  foo        s.Unlock    That being said my other major qualm with this package is that it doesnt seem to work very well with the go generate model. The default mode of operation should not be modifying the file in place rather for a file example.go a better default would be to create a new file examplegomusha.go containing the generated code. Further I dont think that its appropriate to blindly generate public getters and setters for every private field. It would be better to allow the use of semantic comments or struct tags to determine which methods should be generated. It would also be useful to be able to output getters and setters for a specific offset in a file to stdout so that the tool could be invoked from an editor to create desired functions.,golang,cn7ywgm,1,t5_2rc7j

This has two side effects. this is why Go programs report a very high VSS on systems that care about such things on startup the GC reserves but does not allocate a large contiguous block of virtual address space which represents the heap.. because of the first property malloc or mmap will not return a pointer to the virtual address space previously reserved by the garbage collector. this is complicated in real life for windows platforms which have a very fragmented virtual address space this is an outlier that does not invalidate the overall theory of operation of the garbage collector.,golang,cnzu8nr,3,t5_2rc7j

3086660,0,t1_cohl471,Im not entirely convinced that its that much of a cop out. I think theres certainly a lot to be learned from big IDEs but that applies conversely a lot of the big IDEs are big lumbering monstrosities and would benefit from the agility of the editorasIDE style of thinking. I do think if someone has never used the debugging or other convenience facilities ReSharper comes to mind of these big IDEs one has missed a lot on developer experience and I dont think it condescending to assume so. As before though editors have features IDEs lack so this statement applies conversely.That wasnt what I meant though. Go doesnt attract JavaCC or IDE people if you will because the language isnt that attractive to them. The lack of familiar development environments only exacerbates this unattractiveness. The majority of new Go programmers come from dynamic languages.That said I dont think the IDE users voices are so silent. I have some anecdotes of people who snubbed Go because they needed that solution explorer window and projects and found Go wanting in that regard. It may have been unclear on what I meant your assumption that I was talking about using debugging for code validation was rather odd.My comment was about the often false assumption in that imperative languages with strong static typing just work if they compile though it is closer to actual reality in strongly typed functional languages due to the way their type systems are built but languages like Go which allow nil values and mutable state cannot be validated via compilation this assumption is wont and incorrect.Everybody knows code must be validated through some method of testing. I have seen a lot of cases and arguments in the mailing list IRC and blogs where people quip about being so safe when they see their code compiling and this is the assumption I attacked in my initial statement you quoted. It is not completely incorrect to assume some safety when a good compiler or linter is there to call you out on mistakes but it is nave because no matter the quality of the compiler or the strictness of its type system code will never work  properly.Unit tests will expose bugs and when you do encounter them theyre much easier to diagnose with a graphical debugger than GDB and this is where I find Go lacking.,golang,cohxim8,1,t5_2rc7j

3277441,0,t3_2xmnvs,Expanding on the existing comments it is language convention that unless otherwise documented an error return means you must not use the nonerror return value for anything. This is because its impossible to return an invalid answer for the nonerror value in general.You might think it was safe to return nil but even this is not correct. Since nil pointers can still have methods called on them and may still do something sensible a nil return may be perfectly valid!Its worth saying again for clarity In general theres no way to return an invalid object.As a side effect for better or worse I dont tend to worry too much about whether I return a halfconstructed object when returning an error. I dont do it on purpose but if it happens named arguments maybe I dont go out of my way to zero out the halfconstructed object and again thats because the zeroed object may still be valid anyhow. Its up to the user to not use the result except for those vanishing number of methodsfunctions where you can deliberately get both a valid object and an error and are clearly documented as such.,golang,cp1urz5,1,t5_2rc7j

3738447,0,t1_cqi6e9r,The proxy helps with the external repo going away problem. This is not trying to solve that problem as its not something that frequently hurts me. Actually it hurt me once  the mass migration from Google Code to GitHub.The issue with the proxy is you still have a global set of versions. Lets say my main app rev  depends on lib rev . Now in main app rev  I make changes that need lib rev  I have to update the proxy. Problem is I cannot keep this in lockstep with my main app repo. If I ask the build server to release main app  it will build it with lib  which may have changed since lib  I originally intended it to build for.My opinion here is that it doesnt matter what the mechanism is for actually retrieving the versioned packages so long as the version definitions are atomically versioned with the rest of the app code and each checkout will always link the defined versions. This has to account for multiple versioned checkouts on my own machine on the build server eg a fast incremental build may need different versions to that of a slower running full qa pipeline but theyre happening concurrently and to developers across an open source ecosystem.So actually were discussing two solutions to distinctly orthogonal problems. Can I pin app revision X to lib revision Y?. Can I isolate myself from a repo moving deletion?Really it comes down to how much do you value each of those and how much pain are you willing to go through to get it.So which solution for your needs? Standard go get cmd no no effortnone Custom checkout tools eg gogetter and others yes no effortsmall Internal proxy no yes effortmedium Proxy  checkout tools  yes no effortmediumsmall Same repo vendoring with git submodules  yes no effortsmall Same repo vendoring with git subtrees yes yes effortsmallIf you value no yes then proxy may be a good solution for your needs. Though I personally value  much more than  and dont want the added complexity which is why the gogetter script suits me. If I was more concerned with  I would use vendoring with git subtrees instead due to the versioning atomicity.I hops that explains my thinking better.edit formatting,golang,cqiensf,1,t5_2rc7j

It is also a pretty complexadvanced language and also requires investing a serious amount of time to learn and I dont think that right now theres more than a handfull of people that actually mastered it. People ready to invest that much time in learning something expect a good return  and this is currently something Rust cannot deliver to people knowing C. The only thing it brings to the table is its ownership feature for writing safe code something they long learned to avoidhandle themself. Performance is not there the toolings arent there the libraries arent there or all written in CC so why use Rust? ...Go on the other hand does bring a lot more to the table. Easy fast crosscompiled native binaries without any external dependencies is a breath of fresh air for a LOT of people certainly in the ops world where people get sick and tired of having to install ruby java python dependencies nodejs ... just to run a stupid tool that consumes a lot more resources than it should. On top of that it is a simple language to learn certainly for someone with prior experiences in CC  I spent more time figuring out how the build environment worked than I actually did taking initial steps in the language. It also provides a massive amount of libraries encourage codesharing and writing libraries  and is very clearly opinionated which keeps things very clear for everybody well  except the ugly vendoring crapNeither Go or Rust is perfect but the problem Rust faces is that it does not have a clear practical use right now for the audience it attempts to target.,golang,cr7obto,5,t5_2rc7j

Edit in other words I see your point now the following wasnt meant to disagree having to explicitly wrap things to prevent possible breakage is unfortunate at best and I was just saying it is especially bad with things like MarshalJSON.Now that you mention MarshalJSON I vaguely recall a question on StackOverflow where someone was running into a similar issue. JSON marshalling is specifically annoying since there is no trivial way that I know of to write your own marshalling that is a simple wrapping of what the default marshalling does you either use the default marshalling perhaps overridden for subfields by their types or you have to manually marshal your whole type.I.e. what I mean is that for interfaces like fmt.Stringer with type Foo string you can trivially do something like func f Foo String string  return fmt.Sprintfltsgt stringf  to ignore your String method and use the default formating in the fmt call. I dont know of any trivial way to do something similar in a MarshalJSON method.,golang,crhnjxs,1,t5_2rc7j

Converting go to c would permit to use spin by example. And also go is highproductivityoriented so I cant say to add such an analytic work.But I can think to port some ideas to golang. Not all the framework just a little piece.What I would like would be something added to the test framework which permits me to write comments like assert net.Conn   ampamp filedesc  meant that in this point we have no sockets open and no files open. Then when I import a function i can lock it like assert net.Conn   ampamp filedesc  myforward  newUpNp assert net.Conn   ampamp filedesc  this would mean that before and after this call I expect there are no file open and no socket open. Then some test framework could check if this happens or not.This would solve many problems when writing and when importing This is not a full verification neither a verification at all I am just importing some ideas Ive seen  but could be very very useful imagine I expect at a certain pont a lt  and a gt   just write it as a comment and some test tool can check if this happens.Just my two cents of course.,golang,crjevzk,1,t5_2rc7j

So I cant do a performance test using this lib.Than I made a few curl processes using negotiate which crashed the server pretty fast.  Indeed its not thread safe. I also need a way to authorize user against kerberos with a password.  As far as I can see it its not implemented in your lib yet.  I wont be able to use this lib as it is right now.

To prevent this situation create a randomly named mutex and store the name so that it can only be obtained by an authorized user. Alternatively you can use a file for this purpose. To limit your application to one instance per user create a locked file in the users profile directory.edit To be honest this is exactly the kind of problem you should just not care about.

5508454,0,t3_3qjo2q,Lets go point by point.. The author thinks that having  as a legit slicearray index is a good thing and I completely disagree. This creates the possibility that a badly written code produces a negative number as an index and this doesnt cause a runtime failure everything just goes on as if nothing happened and the code is correct. What about indices that are bigger than lens? Should they return the zero value as if nothing happened? No thank you!  It would be interesting to have some syntactic sugar e.g. sn instead of snlens but its not critical. The other criticisms about the awkwardness of deletion and inserting are rather valid but this comes from the fact that inserting and deleting in continuous blocks of memory is awkward and you should only do it if you know what youre doing.. This is in the FAQ I think most of the times confusion comes from the fact that the information about interface inner workings like urscs famous article is often omitted or not given enough attention in the beginner documents.. This is legit. I hope that in Go . shadowing is just removed completely. I.e. if you have a variable i in a scope above yours you cannot create an i of your own.. Again this comes from the fact that interfaces are secretly structs. And yes this is annoying but the author doesnt propose any possible solutions that would not implicitly allocate a load of interfaces.. Thats why ranges first return value is the index  so that you could take a reference of the element. Im not sure if something like range but returning a pointer would be useful. It certainly wouldnt work for maps.. Anyone who doesnt love the fact that in Go importing a modulecreating a variable and not using is an error clearly has not spend hours trying to decide which CSSJS modules are still used and which arent.

5944819,0,t1_cxx9kdt,NOTE After having written the following it occurs to me that subtypepolymorphism and latebound this exist because of the inheritance antipattern. If you dont use inheritance in your OOP languages you can solve those problems more naturally using composition and interface polymorphism the defaults in Go. Latebound this seems to exist to allow you to change the implementation of a methods in the child class while still permitting the child to be used where the parent is used subtype polymorphism. The fact that you want to keep the interface but change the implementation should alert you to use interface polymorphism and possibly composition if youre actually using some of the parent classs implementation instead. Personally I consider inheritance to be an antipattern in any language composition  interface polymorphism seem to solve every problem more elegantly. Any language which implements composition and interface polymorphism satisfy my criteria for OOP those which provide inheritance as well are only giving you some easilyabused syntactic sugar for defining an interface and automatically delegating to another unchangable object.NOTE It also just occurred to me that protected is another feature that is needed to allow inheritance to almost solve the same problems as composition  interface polymorphism.Im pretty sure subtype polymorphism is a solution in search of a problem. With composition just pass the inner parent element to the function that takes the parent. Maybe this has deeper implications when combined with latebound this but on the surface this works    type Parent struct  ...     type Child struct Parent Parent    func TakesParentp Parent  ...     func main         c  ChildParent Parent...        TakesParentc.Parent    Maybe I dont understand latebound this correctly but it also seems like a solution in search of a problem. Heres an example I think demonstrates its use in Java    public class Parent         protected String name        public ParentString name             this.name  name                public String Introduce             return Hello Im   this.name                public class Child extends Parent         public ChildString name             supername                public String Introduce             return Hi my name is   this.name                public class Main         public static void printIntroParent p             System.out.printlnp.Introduce                public static void mainString args             Parent p  new ParentBob            Child c  new ChildRalph            printIntrop  Hello Im Bob            printIntroc  Hi my name is Ralph            Go lets you do the same via interfaces and composition    package main    import fmt    type Parent struct     Name string        func p Parent Introduce string     return Hello Im   p.Name        type Child struct     Parent Parent        func c Child Introduce string     return Hi my name is   c.Parent.Name        type Introducer interface     Introduce string        func printIntroi Introducer     fmt.Printlni.Introduce        func main     printIntroParentBob           Hello Im Bob    printIntroChildParentRalph  Hi my name is Ralph    Of course composition  interfaces is probably the proper solution in Java as well even though the Java folks love them some inheritance.,golang,cxyw9ar,2,t5_2rc7j

8107537,0,t1_d4qznfa,I am actually using gocq at work which was also compatible with the golang SQL driver. I decided when I was building this that I would make it compatible but focus on making additional interfaces that were neo specific as well. Im going to be adding more high level interfaces that make working with it much easier. You currently have to prepare a statement to use it. Ill be adding higher level query functions to hide some of that complexity. They also will allow me to communicate with neo in a more efficient way by being able to pipeline more statements at once.Im also going to rework the readme to add proper examples and such. I released that at like  am that night so I just kinda threw it up there with the bare minimum. I got into this project because I was reading the bolt spec and I thought hey I can build this! Ive never actually built a binary driver before but golang is particularly good at handling that type of integration. It was a lot of fun.I was kinda hoping I could get a real Go expert to look over the implementation and give some feedback on how I could make it more efficient.

You might be able to write it but itll require you to release your stuff in lockstep with go.This is basically the best argument you could wish for for why using unsafe is a bad idea if this breaks itll break very subtly so you will probably not catch it with testing but at the same time catastrophically enough that you might be thrown back into Cworld in regards to vulnerabilities and stuff as you might be wildly writing into random heap locations.,golang,d6n6dn6,1,t5_2rc7j

In my limited understanding of TDD its acceptable procedure that writing the test for functionality or feature of the software may come before the feature is coded. The developers task is to then write code which passes said test  tests and then refactor and repeat. In your reply you talk about approaching the API from the users perspective. To make clear from your statement do you imagine that as a user you expect a function  for example  that colors a shape to accept a shapereference and the color and return error if unsuccessful. Then code a test which passes shapes with valid and invalid field data along with color data both valid and invalid. Next implement the ColorShape function so that it colors the shape  its primary purpose  and returns error on invalid input without crashing the application. Am I on the right track or waiting for a train thats not going to arrive?My interest and questions above result from your test of someone elses code. It may be too much to ask. But I believe an explanation in how you tested this code would add value in better understanding the process  even if its a process unique to you.

Most Go features would be unavailable goroutines anyone? unless you wrote a large enough shim to satisfy the runtime which would be big enough to well be an OS kernel running a single process.And when done I doubt the runtime would be well suited for implementing various kernel features.

9735200,0,t3_5eho8k,Probably one of the cheapest and best solutions is DigitalOcean. Even if you do not have a lot experience with setting up a Linux server they have awesome tutorials that guide through setting up and securing your server. You will learn lots of things this way but you might need to do some server maintenance eventually.If you want a free solution your best bet is probably Google App Engine which also has the big advantage that you do not have to tweak or maintain the server. The big downside is that you need to modify your code to play with the App Engine platform which depending on what you write can be a lot of work. This also means that if you later want to migrate your program to a generic server you will need to do more changes. Of course there are ways to write your code so that it plays on both App engine and a generic server but it can be quite a lot of work.,golang,dad2qhg,2,t5_2rc7j
