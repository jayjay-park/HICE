6186946,0,t1_cyssuc6,WTF cares?  Thats not the only consequence to street racing or being obsessed with street racing in fact that would actually be the lowest of the low hanging fruit event one could write into a story on the subject.  That would be the kind of thing my mom would put into any story on the subject.  Try again.The problem is most mangaka arent good writers like most of anything and most manga readers arent terribly good objective judges of story or character they only know what they like and dont like and the authors of these sorts of narrowcast subjects are playing to groups of readers who dont know any better about a given subject andor readers who will consume anything at all related to a subject more concerned with the adornments and trappings and  paraphernalia than much else.  These manga are written for kids who also buy all the tuner magazines and dream about all the things theyd like to do to the beater Honda or Toyota they got from Mom and kids in Japan that may not have access to a car until theyre an adult.What Ive seen if youre into computers then Initial D is like the movie Hackers.  The basics are correct but the authors dont always understand how they go together doing wrote retelling of something read that wasnt fully understood and they both use lyrical imagery in place of prosaic realism to provoke a feeling in the readerviewer for something abstract.Wangan appears to be more like Mr. Robot which is only technically more realistic in that the technical aspects are given more detail more elaborate exposition though it still appears the author just did more background research without actually being intuitively in tune with the culture and things theyre writing about and in Mr. Robot its clear the author really doesnt really understand much more about computers or hacking culture they just place it in a setting that viewers accept as more realistic.  Its still only a superficial improvement to a nonstory noncharacter part of the creation.,initiald,cysw35k,1,t5_2t9bc

Its the same with Mako. In extra stage  Iketani didnt want to let her go but he did because she was too into racing to bother with a relationship. Only difference is that Iketani didnt cry from that but Kyoko did.,initiald,dcvretj,1,t5_2t9bc

11320085,0,t1_dfdfvq1,No.  Its touge.  Its based on something real unlike anything in Dragonball Z.  In fact Takumi is based on a real person Keiichi Tsuchiya the original Drift King.  Hes precisely why Takumi drives an AE Trueno Sprinter and drifts while touge racing.,initiald,dff42bl,5,t5_2t9bc
11348020,0,t1_ddi37ph,I disagree in that regard Storm.The two later in the series are what I would believe separate from Emperor. They wouldnt be the kind of people Sudo would keep under his reign.Sudo He has even a mild sense of honor for being an asshole but hes smart knows what hes talking about and even is a slight mentor in a way to takumi in their brief encounters.The Second evo team are just scum putting high stakes of money on a race going out of their way to make up for a lack of skill to try and sabotage the race.In all honesty if they were a part of Emperor It would have been MUCH more satisfying if Sudo and the rest of the team came to beat the hell out of them in the end.,initiald,dfi9zyd,1,t5_2t9bc

The manga did have a much better story in my opinion but the music in the show definitely wins my vote,initiald,dgo9m6o,1,t5_2t9bc
