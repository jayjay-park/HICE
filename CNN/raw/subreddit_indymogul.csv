1722073,0,t3_2e4ajg,To be plain and simple myself I offer my criticismthe planes dont have reflections on them they look too D like. there are no clouds reflecting into the airplanesno camera shake. I know that when people think camera shake they think oh you are just an ametuer but the truth is the camera shake adds intensity gets the audience going in their seatsone of the things I do to try and make the look realistic is to add just a tiny bit of noise grain but not too much something between  at the mostthe lighting needs to match the scene if you see the tutorial from video copilot you would guess why.obviously the gun shots going into the big airplane were moving.Dont take this the wrong way but it just needs a lot of work. but its ok I have struggled to do the same things all of the time so dont give up! just keep going at it keep experimenting. ,indymogul,cjw8c9a,1,t5_2x73v
