10247539,0,t3_4yl2t6,I dont know why but it doesnt work for me.Im recording Gameplay with Shadowplay ending up with x  clips.When im using the solution above  importing a  clip in the first place  then I have the frame around my  clip like described. But it doesnt help me After that Im using my custom preset with x  and after exporting Im ending up with a clip which has an aspect ratio of  says the properties but the clip itself is still in .The only difference I see is when I do not import a  clip in the first place and I open the exported clip with winmediaplayer it is a  window. When I use a  then thex exported file in winmediaplayer is in  but showing blackbars...,shotcut,dc5m5v8,1,t5_33dzv
