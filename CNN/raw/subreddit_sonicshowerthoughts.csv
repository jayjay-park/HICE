6638968,0,t3_46lhob,I dont know that abortions would still be a thing except in extremely rare cases. Contraceptives would be free easily accessible and far more effective than they are now and our contraceptives are pretty effective. So the incidents of unwanted pregnancies would probably be exceedingly rare.In utero medical care would fix all but the worst ailments. Past that I suppose there would be an occasional pregnancy that would be unfixable and either be a danger to the mother or would result in a severely disabled child. Star Trek has always been rooted in humanism and Im not versed well enough in the philosophy to comment on its view of abortion.Suffice it to say if abortions did happen I doubt they would just beam it into space. A life was lost and life being sacred above all else in Star Trek the remains would be treated with the utmost dignity.,sonicshowerthoughts,d060yva,11,t5_3156i
6645228,0,t1_d06ks4v,Heres the thing Bodily Autonomy is very important. Its the right of an individual to determine what happens to their own body and who has access to their body.  This is the basis of why rape enslavement and many other things are wrong you are forcibly taking control over ones body from them without their permission.  This autonomy continues beyond death in order for a person to take an organ from another human being that human must have given permission before their death that their body can be given to others.  The ultimate point of this is that no one can take your body or parts of your body without permission.  Even if for some reason you are the only person who can donate something that will save the other person even if that thing is as easily given and as unproblematic as blood it is wrong to take it by force.  It is wrong to take someones blood without their permission even if it means saving the life of one of their loved ones.  Suppose I woke up hooked up to you and I were keeping you alive through blood transfusion of some sort and I needed to stay hooked up to you in order for you to survive.  If I revoked the permission for you to use my body and unhooked myself I am morally in the right.  Only I am allowed to determine who uses my body for whatever purpose.  Even if we grant personhood status to a fetus from conception even if we grant it life status denying someone an abortion means that we are giving another human being more rights to use another human beings body than we give to corpses.  ,sonicshowerthoughts,d06oabh,5,t5_3156i
