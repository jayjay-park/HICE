6902376,0,t1_d0yjdq9,Is it true that Clifford actually has been really strict on Lin more than the rest? A tiny mistake can cause Clifford to bench Lin.. ie VS Pistons th quarter a pass to Franzz and turnover. But Clifford kept on yappin at Lin during timeout.. This game vs Rockets Lin was efficient both in offense and defense.. Thats all he needs to do atm cuz he cant afford to get injured.,JLin7,d0ypbgw,1,t5_3d1t8

7449221,0,t1_d2ox0nq,His major contribution to the win against Spurs Cavs and every other strong team out there proved that he could lead a team to play at a high level but Hornets is trying their best to push Kemba as their one and only superstar of the team. His shots made is being cancelled out by his shots attempted to be honest. He had a high scoring game because he took a lot of attempts and he pretty much played solo a lot of time even when his drives didnt work.,JLin7,d2oxgvv,1,t5_3d1t8
7461790,0,t1_d2q9b6k,I dont think its contradicting at all for what he said. He wants a team that actually wanted him on the team and the only way to show that is to show how much they are willing to pay him to get him to stay but he doesnt mind giving discount if they have showed him that they really really appreciate having him on board.Imagine if youre getting paid milyear to help win a playoff game while other players get paid milyear Lamb and sit on the bench throughout the entire playoff you would feel that they dont actually want you just lending you for their own benefit and throw you into a dumpster after finish using you.,JLin7,d2qcy3j,2,t5_3d1t8
7466951,0,t1_d2qdb0t,This is his typical way to shut down questions concerning Lin. The hidden line here is shut up now. I dont care about Lin. Stop asking me about him. I didnt pay much attention to his game at all. I only love my bb stars. ,JLin7,d2qy2mb,1,t5_3d1t8

7877758,0,t1_d41dobc,The only source to that rumor is some random article where they played it off like it was a fact Lin turned down the terrible offer instead of stating it was a rumor. No sources of course. I really hate these rumors because anyone can just make shit up and make Charlotte look bad for giving Lin such a pitiful and disrespectful offer lowering his potential offers from other teams. .m is such a random number and doesnt even have the length of the contract attached to it. Literally that guy pulling a number out of his ass because he felt like it. ,JLin7,d41j6ry,1,t5_3d1t8
9127144,0,t3_556blh,Dont worry Brook is staying in Brooklyn. If Marks wanted to trade him he wouldve gotten rid of Brook when he got rid of Thad and almost the entire team before free agency started.Marks understands how important Brook is to the success of the Nets. He knows that Brook is a high character loyal and very skilled player that deserves to lead the team along with Lin. Also keep in mind Marks and Atkinson took Brook to recruit players this summer the first time Brook said hes ever done that. It wasnt confirmed but Brook most likely flew out to Palo Alto to recruit Lin at midnight.Brook has survived  years of annual trade rumors on the Nets from multiple incompetent GMs  front offices and head coaches. He will now thrive under Marks and Atkinson. ,JLin7,d88xmw1,6,t5_3d1t8
9404469,0,t1_d9827h3,Yup Ive detailed what happened in this thread which also got deleted from rGoNetsYoure right most liberals are willfully ignorant. They believe what they want to believe even if the proof and evidence that debunks their ideology is sitting right in front of their face. They believe everything theyre told via the biased propaganda media entertainment industry their friends and family etc. When confronted with the actual truth facts and statistics they either ignore it or lash out because their paradigm gets smashed and they have nothing to defend their positions with except vile words censorship hypocrisy and ignorance.Theyre also extremely intolerant of opposing viewpoints and pretend to be tolerant. They prefer to shout down their opponents with lies and namecalling. Its sad that political discourse in this country has been shutdown by hardcore leftists. ,JLin7,d982zwo,2,t5_3d1t8
9406849,0,t3_59fkvf,i thinks hes a solid PG and should be paid more. To be honest if hes not an Asian American he will be paid more. Any other bench players might get mil for  years.,JLin7,d98du4t,3,t5_3d1t8
