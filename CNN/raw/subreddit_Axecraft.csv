167077,0,t1_cexg6fu,got it out.  it wasnt a wooden hammer... but a wooden stump used like a hammer.  its undamaged a little rusty but now i need to take out the broken ass handle and  replace it plus im assuming sharpen it and take off the rust thats formed on the head.,Axecraft,cexgorm,1,t5_2ur7b

1383861,0,t3_29ygi5,Oh thats a pretty Axe.  Hope someone can I.d. it. The beard  bit projecting down   is so you can choke your grip right up to the top for finer work.  Its a woodworkers bearded Axe of some type.,Axecraft,cipr0qo,3,t5_2ur7b
1826166,0,t1_ck97xxu,I concur. That patina is a layer of oxidation that will actually protect against further pitting better than a mirrored finish would.,Axecraft,ck98sb7,3,t5_2ur7b
1914313,0,t3_2gbxbw,Thats beautiful.  Im no woodworker  so what is involved in this?  Just carve out the handle and then carve a pine piece that exactly matches the size of the cutout?  Must take a good bit of sizing and eye for detail.,Axecraft,ckjv1mh,1,t5_2ur7b
3049916,0,t1_coc1m1q,That was one that really caught my eye in this auction. I plan on making a belt hatchet out of it. It has been soaking in vinegar since the original post.,Axecraft,coe4eqf,1,t5_2ur7b
3356170,0,t3_2ylzqn,if i had an axe with a handle in decent shape or had some old label from the s on it and i was only planning on using it around the house then yes id be willing to leave it.   if its an axe i plan to take camping or hunting im changing it out. i dont want my only handle to fail  hours from a store,Axecraft,cpattin,3,t5_2ur7b
3406019,0,t3_2z87uf,I had picked up a pretty rough Sater Banko hatchet from a relative a while back and got that urge to try and fix it up this weekend.I had never intended on making official progress pics but I did grab these photos as i was sending them to a friend.I didnt do this to resell so I probably did a lot wrong. My intentions are to use the hatchet on a trail that I occasionally help with.The Butt of the hatchet was beat pretty badly and was mushrooming all around and the edge was chipped dinged bent etc.Originally my plan was to just use a bastard mill and touch up the bit and after i did that I knew I just had to make this hatchet shine!I took the bastard mill to the butt as well in hopes of removing the mushrooming and the bang marks.For the rest of it i just used what I had in the house which turned out to be a foam sanding block that I had previously used in patching some drywall in my house.Overall I do not think it turned out too bad! What do you guys think?,Axecraft,cpgietb,2,t5_2ur7b
4084384,0,t1_crlq5cm,I have been practicing on several different axes again with mixed results. What do you think about pressure with a stone? Do you push or just let the weight of the stone do the work?,Axecraft,crlufy9,1,t5_2ur7b
4431514,0,t1_csoubqe,Someone I know bought this for carving and likes it a lot. It did need sharpening when it arrived however he liked the weight and shape.,Axecraft,cspa4x1,2,t5_2ur7b
4480310,0,t1_csuhyli,Gosh thats a bloody good looking axe isnt it... Agreed though as its just plain wood I dont think it could look out of place no matter the age or condition of the head. Hope OP does a followup with it hung. I think itll look grand.,Axecraft,csvesih,2,t5_2ur7b
4827419,0,t1_cu317tf,Awesome piece of history. Just need some handles and away you go.,Axecraft,cu31b1d,2,t5_2ur7b
5249029,0,t1_cvigwp7,Some of these subs get pretty fetishistic about old things. Its a tool. It was not being used so was worthless now it is useful and being used. At the same time you gained experience in crafting your own tools. Kudos to you.,Axecraft,cvip3hd,4,t5_2ur7b
6066041,0,t3_3ympml,The Husky handle is . x .. at the base of the axe head and the Wetterlings handle is . x . at about the same point. The handle does get to about the same thickness at the point where I drew the blue line.  My concern is that it would have to come down all the way to this point. Is that an issue? Should I get a larger handle?,Axecraft,cyer04q,1,t5_2ur7b
6387474,1,t3_43507k,Im not entirely sure why people get so bent out of shape about poorly hung axes theyve bought. Your really just paying for the quality of head why not just rehang?,Axecraft,czfotqn,-1,t5_2ur7b

7545069,0,t3_4ioesa,Do not ever ever ever soak an axe in water. I really dont know where this came from you will ruin your handle for sure. I would do what the other guy suggested in soaking it in boiled or raw linseen oil. Handles can come loose depending on the environment as wood moves over time it shrinks and expands depending on the ambient humidity. Can you show us pictures? It would be easier to suggest what to do if we had an idea of what the problem is.,Axecraft,d2zu5u9,2,t5_2ur7b

9161983,0,t3_55rvx6,If you want to sell it then dont do any more work on it. A person that knows its value will see the finished product in their mind and not need you to try and clean it up. Maybe hit it with some steel wool to remove rust oil it and list it. As said already dont sharpen it. I actually use these large crosscut saws to process my firewood each year and sharpening them takes specific tools and skill. ,Axecraft,d8dck1w,2,t5_2ur7b

10653681,0,t1_ddera41,Is there an ideal for a useful tool? I got it for . Im going to reverse its damage and give it back its potential. That is a happy hatchet.  I have a project. I am a happy axe enthusiast. ,Axecraft,ddeuft7,1,t5_2ur7b

10657671,0,t1_ddera41,I use junker hatchets like this to clear small roots around the root ball of tree stumps and bushes after I cut them down if Im pulling them. Rocks. Abrasive dirt. I dont really care if I nick the edge on something like this. I file it until its sharp enough to do the task and save nicer hatchets for finer safety related work like kindling or even firewood splitting at a campsite. ,Axecraft,ddf99qz,2,t5_2ur7b
11603321,0,t3_65lil3,Tricky! Theyre not meant to come out once they go in as the steps make it virtually impossible. But! You could try drilling a series of small holes to get it to collapse in on itself. Perhaps start with a  bit as a pilot hole and move up to a th inch bit. Ive only ever done this with wooden wedges on vintage axes where I wanted to salvage the handle and it works okay.,Axecraft,dgb8v0y,2,t5_2ur7b
