1294649,0,t1_cif8hl9,Chairs and Empress equips specifically Dragon Tail. For Dragon Tail you can find Shoes Hat Robe and Gloves for  Mill then resell for  Mill. It works but try finding them with potential it helps the item sell faster. I use a website that cant be said here from what Ive heard to look up prices and it updates every minute or so. It tells me whos selling the item the name of the shop what  value is the item selling for I only buy items that are selling for  or less than the market price and in which FM they are located. Sorting your servers entire FM by market  is the best although the beginning of the list will be crap stuff so youll have to learn what items actually have value through time shouldnt take longer than  weeks. It even has an app for android dont know about other phones! The prices might vary for different servers though. Ive seen dragon tail go for the best prices in Galicia and Windia but I havent done much research on other servers.

1381295,0,t3_29x6c8,Mihile is an awful class to play really none of the skills really do much and his mobbing is pretty awful. Leveling will be a slow and painful process. The only ever reason to level up Mihile is for his Link cant be knocked back for a certain period fo time skill has cooldown which can have its uses on something with  stance. I figure eventually they will revamp him. He is the worst out of the three.Dawn Warrior is pretty good. The mobbing gets crazy as it has some of the best mobbing skills in the game. However endgamewise and bossingwise it isnt too great even with its buff. The link skill being the Cygnus link skill is pretty good and its charactercard isnt too shabby either. It works for beefing up any melee toon you make.Paladin has horrible and I mean horrible leveling. Everything outpaces you. Your skills never change its literally the same thing expanded to every element. However you will also never die. You exchange all your power for the ability to simply not die. With all the buffs you get and shields you are the tankiest thing in the game pretty much. Paladin is probably the best at bossing out of the  simply because you can do it so much earlier without care because of defensiveness. It will take longer but you can do it. After playing all  Dawn Warrior was the most fun to actually level up. It was super fast and easy. It gets harder as you push it to endgame stuff. Takes a lot more to get to the potency of a Paladin. Mihile is horrible though. Never play it unless you want that link skill.,Maplestory,cipfh0l,5,t5_2rrdo

I dont suggest getting a Necro anymore due to the fact that level  epic potentials being more common and will overtake the damage an unpotted Necro weapon can give.Plus that was when I was also talking out of my ass like you can grow mesos from trees. You cant expect everyone to be able to make hundred millions instantly and buy the end game items right at . Youll be using your stuff a lot longer than that. I suggest advice that has the most benefit for the least amount of mesos involved. However Im not a typical PQ EVO or MPE power leveler. Your prime areas to make mesos are from  to . You lose that window the chances to make mesos naturally start to diminish as you wont be able to kill elite monsters and bosses very efficiently anymore.You can get Scania reinforced gollux pendant and belt for  mil total if you scan the market once in a while. The good thing about gollux is that you need to farm coins for the ring and earrings. It isnt luck based just time.Getting  cheap Empress is a waste of mesos for little to no benefit long term. I did that on my Dual Blader. Bought Empress dagger boots shoulders and gloves. You want to know what happened to the empress? The gloves got replaced by high dimension gloves  spell trace scrolled. The boots got replaced by  luk. the shoulders are still there because Ive got nothing else and are completely overpriced just to have alone. The weapon replaced by Damacus.

And of course Assassins MarkNight Lords Mark which cause extra stars to shoot out and hit mobs around you. Leveling speed is good strong mobility paired with ranged attacks. Still a little squishy but thats the life of a thief. gt  Are they decent in PQ?Ive spent some time with HermitsNLs in RnJ and DIPQ.. Haste !

2459403,0,t3_2npm0a,Theres a few things you can do.The most profitable would be to sell the nx for meso. Do know that this is technically against Nexons terms of service However with the way that the economy is it simply is the most bang for your buck. Its not usually something that Nexon bans for but know that they could if they wanted to. With selling NX do know that it is easy to get scammed. You need to find someone trustworthy to do the transaction with. Dont trust someone simply because they say you can trust them. I also would not recommend trying to sell it by standing in FM entraceplenty of scammers wait there.The other way and usually much less profitable is to buy cash shop surprise boxes and sell the nx that you obtain from them.

2476618,0,t3_2nwaru,This game is DEFINITELY paysave timea lot of time at that. You can access pretty much any piece of content that you wish in this game without paying a penny.  People in this thread so far have failed to mention that NX game credit by paying  to nexon is not mutually exclusive from mesos the in game currency. If you look around decently enough you will find people willing to trade one or the other. Of course this is technically against Nexons ToS but frankly Nexon doesnt give two flying fucks about nx trading anymore and have really laxed their regulations regarding this issueyou can publicly broadcast to your server than you are buying NX at a km rate and the chance you will get banned is virtually zero. Im going to admit that a lot of content is actually NX exclusive and SOMEONE out there is going to be paying for it but whether it is you or not is entirely up to you provided you are in a decently populated servers with ample NX buyers and sellers. This way you go about your business in the game making profits in the form of ingame currency and converting it to NX. For example youve made b profits in the last week and youd like to use this extra money youve made on some bonus potential cubes only purchasable through NX. You would find a NX seller and lets say that the mesoNX ratio in your server is km so you would pay the NX seller b in exchange for k nx in the form of a code or a gift. You could then use the k nx to purchase a pack of bonus potential cubes.TLDR   NX  Mesos,Maplestory,cmhtx6c,1,t5_2rrdo

While most magicians are slow bulky and have very large hitboxes on their attacks the blaze wizard is faster attacks rapidly with orbital flame and has smaller attack hitboxes.Of course every redditor is going to tell you to try everyone but that honestly takes too long  not to mention that a starting account has a whopping three slots. My advice to you is to consider a other magicians or b another class type. If you want something fast in and out of combat consider Jett what you expected me not to say it? Thunder Breaker or Mercedes. If you want to destroy lots of enemies at once consider a cannoneer Angelic Buster or Luminous.Also if youre both playing as magicians youll be using the same equipment type  which may make getting stronger difficult since gear matters most of all.,Maplestory,coaapnh,1,t5_2rrdo

A good thing about Shadower is that they other hyper skill is amazing.It does damage while you are free to do more damage. Shadower mobbing skill also feel very slow compare to Dualblade.

3408825,0,t1_cpfvjhi,Currencies are defined by their general acceptance of value. Really the defining of bitcoin as currency is a matter of semantics though.Bitcoin is well spread and accepted enough that is considered a real currency all over the world. Some economists however argue that because it is relatively scarce in that very few bitcoin transactions happen daily it is not a real currency. There are problems with this though to define a currency by its use excludes anything that is in low circulation. Is the US silver dollar currency? It is legal tender but people dont buy with it. To argue that its not currency is questionable. Likewise the Vietnamese Dong is scarcely used even in Vietnam the USD is widely used in the booming economic sector. If you try to convince anybody that the Dong is not a real currency because its not widely used though most people will give you a strange look.Also the rule Cash transactions will not be permitted... I dont think it implies that noncash transactions such as the bartering of livestock is permitted. Rather I think thats just something thats implied. The rules are succinct and therefore it can be expected that not everything is covered.

3796648,0,t3_33vuh8,Leveling is viewed with a different perspective. Previously leveling was something many people did for enjoyment or rather they did what they enjoyed and then they leveled as a result of that. Whether it be questing pqing grinding etc. Most people didnt play the game for the endgame content I think it was understood that most of us would not get to that point. Nowadays leveling is more or less a barrier between you and the game. Bossing for example is a lot more common nowadays than in the old maplestory and bossing requires you to be a certain level.One way to look at it is levels  in the present day maplestory is representative of level  in the old maplestory. These levels are filled with people who are unfamiliar with the game and may enjoy playing through it the first time. However as times goes on and you make more and more characters it starts to feel like a chore.

3992884,0,t3_366zr9,My favourite combination Melee warrior with combosWho fits those roles?Hayato and Zero.I have had the absolute most fun playing those jobs out of every single other job in maplestory Ive leveled all to atleast  aside from Beast Tamer and Shade recently due to school.I was really tired of pressing one key to rule them all  i.e. Luminous and a ton of classes  just because it was their best skill and there wasnt any point in using anything else.When I picked up Hayato it was a huge breath of fresh air. I had to learn the ins and outs of how his combos worked there are all sorts of little quirks youll learn by reading devoted guides or just by playing and I actually felt like using all of his skills no matter the damage because they all served great for utility. You can use almost all of his skills to get around the map which actually makes Hayato the most fun class for me between Zero and Hayato  no flash jump either it feels great. You get rewarded with really cool hyper passivesactives later on which contributes to the end game. Unfortunately hes not the greatest bosser and can be hard to fund as weapon attack increases his range more than raw stats do as I found.Zero on the other hand is great for me because I love the combos but hes also an overpowered sonovabtch who gets free cubing on a weapon which translates into primary and secondary weapon potentials. In this sense I dont need to worry as much about funding or spending actual money to be able to boss but there inherently comes the challenge of using combos properly and effectively against bosses! Magnus is especially hard because none of your skills let you stand still and balls that  hit you fall from the ceiling.Anyways thats my insight on them Hope you find a class you like!,Maplestory,crbf7rs,6,t5_2rrdo

4752228,0,t3_3g05cu,You should always scroll your weapon first. I prefer doing it myself because it usually ends up way cheaper this way.What I do is prime but I take advantage of the reward point shop and coins shop.Basically what you want to do is get a prime scroll. Then what you would need it a protection scroll a guardian scroll and a safety scroll. These  things basically guarantee you that if something fails it doesnt affect you item or scroll at all.Protection scroll prevents your item from booming.Safety scroll prevents  slot from being consumed by a failed scrollGuardian scroll prevents your scroll from disappearing if failed. Useful for primes because they are quite expensive.In the reward shop you can buy guardians and safety scrolls for .k RP and .k RP each respectively. You can get  per months which makes you be able to use AT LEAST  prime scrolls per month if you want to play it very very safe.Coin shop usually have protectionguardian and safety available with a limit of  per character.You would then proceed cubing with Reward Point Shop red cubes and black cubes and meister cubes if you dont want to spend real money on this game. Takes a while but is doable.You could also use the  Spell trace way during spell trace fever which is saturday and sunday. That gives you  success per spell trace  amount you get from dilligence  amount you get from guild which COULD bring you up to about  per spell trace. I dislike this way because in the end you get  atk less and you also require loads of CSS. at least  from previous experiences,Maplestory,cttkaeg,3,t5_2rrdo

Depending on your crit rate and damage  shotting SDH would come at about k to k range.I think for k range you want at least either a superior Gollux set or CRA set complete since those give you  matk and  matk respectively along with the large amounts of stats on the items themselves and the other set bonuses such as  boss on each. Youll also need around  total int or around  total int.

This way you get the most out of your bonuses.In the end you wanna switch out your CRA wep for a  Sweetwater and get the missing CRA piece you arent wearing so you still get the  set CRA bonus.EDIT NVM Im stupid apparently Faf weapons give Boss Attack on themselves so you get that AND the bonus from the set effect.,Maplestory,cutap5f,-5,t5_2rrdo

So essentially your party can kill you too if they arent careful. Everyone just has to be careful when you know that she can cast DR. Theres about an  second cool down when she first casts it or  second cool down from when DR ends. this  minute period is basically your time where you can attack without being careful. ,Maplestory,cuzt80n,1,t5_2rrdo

5821996,0,t1_cxilchl,Rerolling is an RPG term that implies making a new character. Its from DampD Dungeon and Dragons old school table RPG where character creation actually implied rolling a dice to get your stats. Rerolling gt Rolling the dice again on a new character sheet.In most games rerolling simply means that youll play another character but on maplestory they made a mechanic that actually rewards you for each character you play to a certain level with cards and link skill buffing every other characters you have.I just want to add that while rerolling means that you actually level up a new character and dont actually change your character class its actually possible for Explorers th job to be switched between for one of the two other possible th job. For example  a mage end up being either Bishop FirePoison Mage or IceLightning mage so you can switch between those three possibilities. Only for explorers.

5867475,0,t1_cxoqvdm,My original reply wasnt really meant to be taken seriously just in jest as I dont have a whole lot of knowledge on NX scrolls. Ive seen a few primed branches in all honesty but I always find looking at them funny.ucyborax is misinformed though. Shielding wards protect an item from booming from scrolls as Im sure youre aware. This includes enhancement scrolls but also applies to regular scrolls. I believe some NX scrolls have limits on what other NX scrolls they can be used alongside so that may be the root of your problem with the regular shielding ward. If that is the case I believe you will find anyrestrictions present in their item descriptions.Also Superior shielding wards are for superior items in the technical sense. Tyrant and nova gear are called Superior items as it says in their tooltips. If the game allows you to apply it to your branch it is not worth the NX as it will do the same as regular shielding ward.,Maplestory,cxor9d4,2,t5_2rrdo

They try to justify the constant lowering of pallys damage with the fact that hes a super tank which to be fair he is but since every boss has percentbased damage damage reflect or both being a tank is basically pointless in this game.

The reason I put Horntail last is because of the nodeath but otherwise its not that hard. You can tank everything Hilla does except damage reflect and the same goes for Von Leon although its harder to see whats going on as the messages are delayed. Easy Magnus is not that difficult although he probably has more hp than the previous bosses. His attack animations are quite straight forward if youre close range except the dash attack. Avoiding the meteorites may be tricky if you dont have a teleport skill though and the big ones do a decent chunk of damage although not a problem with your HP vamp right?You should also chuck in Ranmaru for possible cubes I believe but dont quote me and start doing both the Gollux and Regards Takeda something questline that leads you to unlocking Princess No boss for alternative  gear with set effect compared to Commerci.If you have nothing else to do you could try Root Abyss but all I know is that  funded on other servers at this level still takes a long time on Vellum,Maplestory,cxu5542,3,t5_2rrdo

5941249,0,t1_cxyeox8,Unfortunately youd need a lot more than that.  coins from  Christmas Boxes would be a  chance from each box to drop one coin. This is not the case.Postbox nerf we do indeed only get one coin per box but the drop rate is under  less than half of what it would be in that situation. In fact someone posted their findings from opening over  boxes and I believe reported a  drop chance. Lets ignore the fact that Reboot boxes also exist for a second and look only at Christmas Boxes. Assuming this  drop chance is correct without patch notes we cant know for sure youd need to open  christmas boxes to get enough coins to buy a single ring or over  stacks of boxes.With the coinperday limit out of these boxes it would take you  days longer than the remaining time in the event just to open enough coins assuming you have an unlimited supply of boxes.If you wanted BOTH rings the belt and pendant it would take a staggering  boxes which would take you almost three months to open far longer than the event period allows.Granted we have Reboot boxes event quests christmas stockings and probably some other methods im forgetting to get reboot coins but regardless the drop rate and cape make it VERY difficult to get the revoot equips from the event store.,Maplestory,cxyff06,3,t5_2rrdo

5945613,0,t3_3wrzp8,I have mixed feelings about the free riding problem.By tracking snipers at drakes I can get a ton of boxes on link mules while simultaneously leveling quickly. Also on reboot having tons of box rewards doesnt negatively affect the underlying economy.Still youre relying on using the work of lower level players to spawn elites for you. Then you give a giant fuck you to these same players by denying one of them a second box. And the more players there are the more likely they will all attempt to nuke it as fast as possible. I will instead fame someone who gets their hit and lets me kill it because theyre so rare these days can happen on decently popular maps without this network.And time sensitivity isnt even the best counterargument. Even at drakes unless theres another dark channel when an elite spawns a level range player or small group of them can kill them within  minutes which only translates to  elite monsters. ,Maplestory,cxz00cv,1,t5_2rrdo

6028786,0,t1_cy9psa6,The problem is that most people will now break that level  barrier as they have grown up and will start to play more efficiently. They will notice that leveling from  is actually very fast and just a boring grind with chimney gallos and skeles. Unless it will be a previous version without these maps but that would mean even less content. The first time through will be very nostalgic but people will slowly realize that there is absolutely nothing to do in the game. Zakum horntail scartar pb depending on version and some minor bosses and grinding at skeles for eternity. It will turn into a ghosttown unless Nexon does add custom content that is in the spirit of the game but people will reject that because it is not nostalgic and sooner or later regret that decision as they see the game dying out. I constantly see this happen to players that I see playing pre big bang private servers for their first time. For some faster than for others. Those servers always die after the race to the top is finished except from a few longer standing servers that have also mostly reached a frozen state but barely live on because their community is still large enough.Compare that to OSRS and you will see that there were countless things to do in the older game and new content has a huge positive effect on the game.

Great for those upandcoming WH bossers who switch from mounted to unmounted combat for example killing Zakums arms and then focusing the body or killing the legstail of HT and then swapping into mounted to deal with the heads at once.ALSO if you run a little bit and then Jump  Summon Jaguar the one that calls it to your side you get a little extra boost to your overall jump height.Shade Your passive healing skill procs off of Spirit Skills cast not the number of hits. That makes Spirit Frenzy  Death Mark your best combination to regenerate HP in a pinch if the need arises. Bomb punch can also work since originally it was a multiple press skill like KaiserDemon Slayers basic attacks. After they rolled it into a single press skill it still casts its individual attacks. Basically Spirit ClawWind Clawwhatever claw is fast but heals once each time it connects with an enemy while Frenzy being a key down skill heals each time it damages the enemy since each hit from it is an individual cast. Death Mark really just boosts the overall healing output on short cooldown each tick it does also heals you since your healing is based off  of your HP not damage. Unsure if it scales off Current HP or Total HP probably Total HP.Mercedes Leap Tornado can be used in some Jump Quests that allow the use of certain Damaging Skills you pretty much walk to the edge jump it pop Leap Tornado since youre well above the  jump height needed to use the skill and it will carry you over to the next platform with ease. Used to cheese the Henesys Pet Park JQ with that.ANY CLASS IN GENERALIf you go to the guy that sells you airplane mounts for use in intercontinental flights buy one. Then you can perform the best easter eggglitch in the history of Maple. What you do is talk to the NPC for the flights. after she accepts your ticket or whatever you gotta drop k on from her start spamming any other mount that youve hotkeyed be it Jaguar Rider or TransformationBattleship whatever during the map change. Youll now be flying that towards Orbis or whatever you chose to go to. Downside to this is that unless your mount is a flying mount some day to perma mounts or has flight animations Wild Hunter Jaguar in the case of DRPQ or just looks the same regardless CorsairJob Xferd Bucc or Cannoneers Battleship it will look really really REALLY awkward when moving around with it in the inflight map.EDIT Formatting and grammatical issues.,Maplestory,cyaxh9z,2,t5_2rrdo

Hero meanwhile has a delay of  for enraged raging blow definitely not  for AS  at AS .Hero enraged blow hs  ms   hits   hs   hsAFA  activation    .  . activations per second hitsactivation so . additional hits puts current heroes at . hs at AS .Obviously this is at current values not the fixed ones which gives them hitsraging blow at that same delay if we take that into account theyre at . hs and they take k less str to cap then paladins but thats a conversation for a different day.Paladin hitss at AS  then runs at ms  . attackss hitsattack is then . hitss activation rate FA  .  .  .hs.. puts them at ..However this does not take into account having to use charge blows at  hitsattack   times every minute I dont have the exact data for charge blow attack speed and I dont feel like dealing with it but it feels slightly slower than blast well give it the benefit of the doubt though and say its only ms.s  ms   attacks of which well say  are blasts           hits attacks brings our adjusted hitblast to approximately . adjusting our calculations gives us .  .  . hs  our . hs from FA  .hsPretty close to heroes Ill admit that there are some other issues though that no one ever likes to talk about. For example a paladin at AS  has to get pretty much perfect timing to hit cvellum twice on his short attacks but most other classes dont have that issue. Effectively halves a paladins dps on bosses like that.In conclusion everyone thought paladins were op and they were briefly but not nearly as badly as everyone said they were nexon fucked us in response. Hitting cap on paladin is hard enough to not even be worth the effort comparitively  I have a list of the equips it took me to accomplish it if anyone cares and assuming you hit cap you still are going to have really mediocre hits comparatively especially once nexon finishes buffing all the other classes.,Maplestory,cym7jvt,1,t5_2rrdo

At least with the platform issues if I just treat it like I have one life I can make it through plus I have  daily keys so I can try  times a day.Gollux is while not easy for all classes fairly easy once you understand how his moves work. The first stage is mainly about bouncing back and forth right at the center assuming you dont have a super long distance attack to keep dodging golluxs attacks while killing the mobs. Second stage is about quickly using the little teleport that warps you to the left platform and getting to the safe spot before he gives you the status abnormality that switches your directional input and then bombarding him from the safe spot while killing mobs Im an IL so I have it a little easier in that regard. Then gem is all about dps while managing the mobs at the bottom. Of course depending on the level of difficulty of gollux the third stage is either the hardest or the easiest. For hardlux gem has so much less hp in comparison to the other stages. For hellux its the opposite.With the disconnecting fixed I can finally do my daily hellux runs and Ill take what I can get while still hoping nexon will fix the platforms.,Maplestory,cyyynup,1,t5_2rrdo

I know it sounds tedious and mind numbing. But here is how it all comes togetherBosses Drop the followingBoss AccessoriesThese are fairly common most of the time the come with potential if the Pot is crap fuse them together to get a new pot sometimes you get lucky and get epic tier. If you trace these and enhance them they sell for a fairly decent amount. or you can use them until you can afford your sweet water and gollux accessories.Silent Crusade Coins No one seems to understand why these are so helpful. Collect a bunch of them if you have a coin purse they simply go unnoticed. So get a bunch open the Silent Crusade UI go to the last tab and buy the envelope only need one. Then use it and it will teleport you to the hideout. Talk to the silent crusade shop npc. Here you can trade  coins for  spell traces. Fast and easy way to accumulate traces not only for yourself but you could sell them as well.Commerci as annoying as the prequests are these will allow you to help fund yourself into the next tier. Not only can you do the solo missions where you can get Superior Item Crystals Cubic Blades and Even CUBES!!! Theses missions give you Denaros not sure if I spelt that right. Accumulate enough of these you get the sweet water accessories. These come Epic from the shop. And sell for a decent amount clean. Then the second part of commerce you will need to get a party of  and with this is where you can get end game sweet water weapons and armor as well as Denaros and the previously stated rewards.Gollux Again Annoying Prequests. however HUGE opportunity for range growth here. Even lower lvls can farm Gollux coins and Gollux equips. Every day you can enter Gollux  times as long as you dont kill the head. First  runs kill everything but the head. Doing so gives you  green coins and numerous blue ones. Make sure to take the time to kill both legs and both arms for you gain willpower exp for doing so which helps you with harder bosses as well as helps you reach cap for ambition exp. Then depending on the difficulty of the final run if youKill both arms and abs  Easy Kill  of the   NormalKill  of the   HardKill nothing  HelluxDepending on difficulty is what you will receive in drops. Just make sure you buy your  advanced and  basic scroll everyday so long as you have enough coins to do so. If you fully scroll them they are Huge assests to your range as well has huge profits to you should you decide to sell them.Crap Equips These come in such quantity that it is mind boggling why anyone is poor. Dont just Drop them EXTRACT them. The item crystals are used in making cubes and other meister lvl goods. As well as sell for a decent amount in fm. There is normally always someone with an extractor set up in The crafting place on channel one. EASY PROFITSee if you get someone to take you to Hard Magnus to get you your Tyrant cape for nothing dont try to spell trace it yet until you have a decent amount of mesos because its roughly  mil per attempt.

6367002,0,t3_42tzu3,KMS Reboot consists of basically farming ToT for pieces of time. It can be fast on certain jobs once you hko such as luminous in both versions but nothing so easy as things like blackgate singapore malaysia ulu etc where you can hko without investing in the character. The reboot meso grind meta is not unique to GMS at all. Its just easier  faster in GMS. No Kannas or BT to increase spawn or drop rate either. No familiars.KMS doesnt have a lot of the transitional gear that people are using in GMS reboot  such as SW gollux alien sengoku treasure ranmaru blackgate former itcg items world tour drops etc. To some degree additional options can close in on this power gap but the set bonuses from many of those items outclasses the vast majority of what you will get from flames. Going back to farming to hko your ToT farm youre going to have to invest more into a KMS character to do it than you would a GMS character which means farming just to farm.For endgame gear of course CRATyrants exists in both versions but while GMS players will spend their mesos on cubes and star force KMS players make mesos slower and need to include the cost of flames. In addition to this KMS has no access to the higher tiered potential accessories that GMS has and continues to lack the set effects from things like gollux.tldr In KMS you work harder and get slightly less for it. If you hate the meso grind in GMS reboot KMS is not the answer.,Maplestory,czdcwjx,2,t5_2rrdo

6553153,0,t1_czx57lh,Dark Knights and Xenons have a skill that basically spins them and deals damage all around them. They are hurricane skills meaning that you can hold down the key for the skill and youll keep spinning. Its meta now that people who use this skill to farm just toggle it with a macro use a rock to hold down the button or bot with it to farm meso. You dont need to do this to farm. In fact the best way to farm is probably Northern Heights with a Phantom of a Bowmaster by using Arrow Blaster. Ive seen some ridiculous rates. Meso farming is important as its the key to buying cubes to reroll potentials that your equipment have and its the premier way to make your equips stronger and boots your damage range. Reboot centralizes around making meso so its wise to make a second character that is good for farming meso. Youll need to buy a pet from the Cash Shop as well its practically essential. Of course you can play without meso farming. Just expect slower progression. You need to do daily bosses and sell the weapons and extract the armor pieces using Alchemy in Ardentmill for a chance to get Philosopher Stones which NPC for about k. Farming ToT and looting Pieces of Time is also viable but still slower. ,Maplestory,czx5ea0,1,t5_2rrdo

6602486,0,t1_d02882c,Thanks for your response. This is really nice.One question for you Character card attack does not work with Att  according to the wiki. How do you suggest character card attack be worked into the equation? Should it be a part of flat att?Something worth noting Display range is quite different from the actual damage output. Im not sure I would trust display range over the formula given on strategy wiki for actual damage.,Maplestory,d0292bo,1,t5_2rrdo
6602881,0,t1_d0292bo,It should be part of flat ATT. Obviously display range is quite different from actual damage output because of numerous reasons.I wouldnt trust Strategywiki too much with the formulas. Theyre generally correct but I wouldnt be surprised if they get corner cases wrong. They still assert that the actual applied IED is the sum of all IED sources which is blatantly wrong. You can have  in IED if you summed all your sources incorrect calculation and still do s on a  Boss if you dont have  IED.Theyre also missing Final Damage multipliers like Final Cut and ACA which was recently officially added to the game. Not to mention certain classes like Heroes have been fixed and fixed again because of Critical Damage bugs with what is now officially known as Final Damage ACAEnrage.,Maplestory,d02ajca,2,t5_2rrdo

Next time you make another post some people may remember and downvote simply because of your name. Accumulate that and youll get  and stay at  regardless of what you do.Im not sure what you mean by those comments being hypocritical. People that already know each other for example friends in school that play together will exclude randoms out or will not be as buddybuddy. This simply makes sense. Always exceptions of course but this is how things are.As for personality difference think about it like this. On a forum like Reddit you dont see the other person facetoface. Its different ingame. Although its not straight facetoface its much closer compared to Reddit. People that you talk to facetoface become more human. For example you know those commercials asking you to donate to starving childrenpooretc? They always show pictures of them to make them seem more human rather than just having some guy tell you about donating.Its true you dont have to spend a cent to get max range... itll just take you maybe half a decade or support from someone that pays real life money.

6680341,0,t1_d0aa50u,MS iswas unoptimized as fuck. On release the game was popular enough to the point that there were  filled channels. Bossing became a HUGE chore. With  people hammering skill keys the game just couldnt handle it. FPSs dropped to sub  and DCing while bossing was all too common. I would sometimes DC  times in a fight. This usually meant that I didnt get loot ..Nexon made strides to attempt to fix the problem. They added a setting that turned off other players skill animations which helped kind of. They also released a video a few months back showing how they fixed a lot of the lag.I think the staggered level cap on release also kind of killed everyones MS boner. Nexon attempted to have the cap set at   and  over a couple month period. This lead to    players making multiple level  characters.      Waiting.      Getting these characters to .      Realizing that their  skills suck and this other previously weak class is OP now so fuck your previous characters.      Get that new class to .      Wait.     Grind to .      Now what?    I personally actually never hit  on my main. Hes still level  right now.Lastly a big turn off for the foreigners is the random banning and the difficulty involved with actually playing the game. It doesnt really add into the game not being popular now but it kind of killed the fun that we were having. There are still some people playing right now but Id rather not get my account banned personally.,Maplestory,d0ab12e,3,t5_2rrdo

Also players who are funded and cap will not be much affected due to final damage increase. Basically this is not going to be as big a deal as many people make it out to be. Easy magnus and normal hilla are so easy even with low ranges that honestly it will add a couple minutes to the time it takes to kill them not that big of a deal. and with no instant death chances other than DR it will still be beatable. Also with a lot of these changes its best to wait til they actually happen and see how it goes before getting worried. A lot of classes got nerfed and then it turned out when the update actually happened it wasnt a big deal and everyone relaxed.,Maplestory,d0wi2ln,1,t5_2rrdo

Given you already pick up a passive  ignore defence at rd job and probably  or so on your equip set effect plus Snipes  ignored given the way different sources of ignore defence seem to be mulplicative rather than additive I would expect things to be about even at low damage range with the damage bonus becoming more worthwhile as you get more damage until you start capping damage at which point the ignore would be better. I would suggest running the Battle Analysis on a stationary boss Zakum perhaps? and testing  runs of right next to him versus far away which should give you a rough idea of how it would add up.,Maplestory,d34z2vp,2,t5_2rrdo

Assuming you get at least  main stat in every pottable armoraccesory equip  attack on your weapon etc.Youll lose about k range if you use the SW Face.

However that wouldnt be the best in slot gear.

When youre without a pet it is very hard to see if a desired drop came or not and even harder to loot it as you have to pick up a pill of stuff before it and even with a pet this is still a thing at party playing. It may also be to motivate players to pick stuff immediately after defeating bosses to make everything quicker. This may also be to reduce the impact of botters since they have troubles to react at shortintervals.It may also be that they want to reduce their servers overload and yeah drops along monster spawns are between the biggest overloads.Though all in all this affect negatively the meso farming at Reboot though it isnt that horrible you can still pick up everything if youre actively playing.,Maplestory,d5d2hv1,1,t5_2rrdo

Period.Its actually sad that so many of them think such negative things are what make the game playable because at that point GMS really does become reliant on having that badbroken content. If you dont have unbalanced broken content the players quit. But having the unbalanced broken content creates such a toxic meta that players usually end up quitting anyway. They know something is wrong but dont realize whats wrong is the thing theyre choosing to take part in. They get frustrated and leave.After all these years the game still seems to be run by the exact same bratty entitled teens even if they might be well into their s at this point.

8580568,0,t1_d6e3oqc,The Weapon Shoulder and Hat are BIS by a massive range and this shouldnt be discussed at all. The remaining pieces are usually superior for giving more PDRBoss for the set bonuses that in fact scale even better in nonReboot but then this is highly variable since the th Class Arcane Cores and Arcane Force can easily greatly change your proportion of Stats VS AttMatt VS PDR VS Boss and this greatly vary with each class so it is a big whole of depends. Otakus calcs are only accounting for the current status quo in GMS.In KMS the whole set is always superior because of the feathers and how they scale with the level though and for the additional stars as well. The set is also superior there because they lack Gollux gear to get PDRBoss from and thus Arcanes ones are even more coveted. But then we might get another potential tier or something as well.Note In Reboot the whole set is BIS as well.,Maplestory,d6e5mr2,2,t5_2rrdo

8635490,0,t1_d6kq2ni,nah ive played and mained both and they are completely different. MM focus on single target damage they are less mobile and very slow attacking. WH is a lot more mobile with  key different percs.  stance which no archer based class every gets and status resist which no archer class ever gets. WH is more mobbing heavy but has the potential to be a great bossing character having a jaguar wasnt the only thing that made it unique it had a triple hurricane  stance  high status resist and great mobbing. MM has high output damage Max Crit over  and great single target damage for bossing.

For the main body what I do is put up a party shield right below its right arm and when the fight starts turn on blue aura and just let it rip with the dark shocks and finishing blows with dark gens on cooldown.

The main problem is that you need to be  for everything you want to get carried in  for your most important gear.  You can try to skip out on some equips but the better your gear the quicker youll level.You dont really need to upgrade your equips with star force and cubes but Id say at least having the appropriate level armor and weapon is the bare minimum for leveling.  Even then its always good to try and fill out every equip slot with nonendgame gear.  By around  training gets slower and mobs get stronger so youll need all the stats you can get.  Depending on your class you may not be able to level efficiently if mobs  shot you or it takes several hits to kill one monster.,Maplestory,d7xwkxo,2,t5_2rrdo

First Shark Sweeps animation lasts a total of  frames as compared to Lightning Punchs . As such Shark Sweeps effectiveness by comparison is better under higher latency. It seems like Shark Sweep is better with abilities that have lower base  making it substantially worse when you use it with Typhoon and Annihilate. Additionally Shark Sweep kind of hits that middle ground between a little more damage and a little more time to react it just isnt as good as Thunderbolt or Lightning Punch at what they excel at.,Maplestory,d96m5t9,1,t5_2rrdo

For example adding  while having  boss already gives you an increase of  end damage actually less depending on your damage . Whereas a not well known fact but ATK is not just multiplied by ATK but ALSO by Stat since Stats and Atk both multiply each other at the end of the formula and then the effects of that added punch are further multiplied by your boss  so YEAH.

9998279,0,t3_5it44x,Doubt itd be a boss or Beryl. Heres my thought from my previous post.  gtIn the latest KMST video this was shown with the line Only silence can free me...  She will be introduced along with the release of Arcane Rivers th area Arcana on February th which is still pretty far away.  The question is who would she be? A boss or a new class? Or just a pure important NPC like Kao?  What are your thoughts?    gtPersonally it may be impossible for her to be another boss while we just got our Lucid not too long ago and shes just one map behind this new area.  I think she might be a new unique class like Zero Kinesis who doesnt have a family tree and her skills might involve manipulating Star Power as in the video she is shown with a horoscopelike theme background.  gtWhen talk about moon and stars night and space it gives a feeling of a quiet atmosphere. Now she told us the line only silence can free me which I assume the word silence here could be referring to her liking to be alone with night. Heck the new area is at night time with crescent moon showing around the maps. So her power might be related to night stars moon possible galaxy effects power.  gtArcane River is a fusion of all worlds beyond time and space that was destroyed. This girl might have came from the future and she was disturbed with these sudden fusion by Lucid and wanted to leave this place and find peace or destroy the fusion and recover everything back to normal. Another reason to fight Black Mage since Lucid will be presumed defeated by players before reaching Arcana the fusion will stay forever like that so the only way is to defeat Black Mage for good so that the world will regain its peace and she will have her quiet place to live again.  gtThen again with all those things said it also bears a chance of having her as an NPC that will guide us through Arcana. Because well a new character starting at a Level  area? Probably not. Unless its another Zerotype class.      Meanwhile Beryl has blue lines of strips on her cheek and different hairstyle and Orchid has purple eyes.  Both of them have no relation to the word silence as Orchid may still seek revenge for Lotus and Beryl is accepted and living with a family of robos.,Maplestory,dbasypu,9,t5_2rrdo

10023311,0,t1_dbe2cxh,TLDR  Type in  for proper formattingActual replyFor the      like you were trying for you need three backslashes so it should look like this when you type it out     which will turn out like this The reason for this is that the underscore character this one   is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does this guy  .  Since the face of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the face this guy  .  The backslash is reddits escape character basically a character used to say that you dont want to use a special character in order to format but rather you just want it to display.  So your first  is just saying hey I dont want to italicize  so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since its just an escape character.  After this you still want the arm so you have to add two more backslashes two not one since backslash is an escape character so you need an escape character for your escape character to displayconfusing I know.  Anyways I guess thats my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lolCAUTION Probably very boring edit as to why you dont need to escape the second underscore read only if youre super bored or need to fall asleep.Edit The reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore which doesnt have an escape character doesnt have another underscore with which to italicize.  Reddits formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text then you put the text you want to format then you put the character again.  For example you would type italicize or italicize in order to get italicize.  Since we put an escape character we have italicize and dont need to escape the second underscore since theres not another nonescaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them.  So technically you could have written  but you dont need to since theres not a second nonescaped underscore.  You would need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line but not if you used a line break aka pressed enter twice.  If you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the nonescaped underscore to italicize.  To show you this you can type italicize and it should not be italicized.,Maplestory,dbe2d1y,5,t5_2rrdo

10553506,0,t3_5r3npm,Level x Kanna here on reboot. Kanna is my favourite class so Im obviously a bit biased but here goesAbout Kannas mobbing I have to admit it can be a bit tedious before th job because you have a regenerating mana pool and it tends to run out. Its easy to find a party though so I wouldnt worry much about that. Once you do get th job mobbings pretty good though youll need a bit more funding than other classes as expected.Bossing same story youll do less than others with similar funding but you have utility in return. Kannas are one of the best if not the best support class in maplestory. With the longest bind in the game an insane matt buff and bossdamage barriers etc. youre very useful in bossing parties.Then again with some effort I can still solo bosses like CRA and Hellux so its not like theyre useless bossers.My final verdict is that if youre playing kanna you have to like it. For the damage its not worth it but if you want to be a great support class both for bossing and for mobbing its totally worth it. You dont just have to be the respawn when bind is up kanna or the forever leeching kanna there is some potential there. Oh and find a guild itll improve your overall experience a lot.,Maplestory,dd4cx8n,1,t5_2rrdo

10653452,0,t1_dderyb7,That sounds fine! Since the Commerci coins dont really have a purpose after you max out the ship its totally fine to purchase a second set and use one pair as drop gear and the other pair for damage. I didnt even consider buying two sets of these but if it works why not? If it doesnt use Sweetwater GlassesTattoo for damage and Zak FaceEye for drop rate. Yep! Thats what I did for my Reinforced Pendant so far. Shoulder Accessories CANNOT get Drop Rate. Go for main stat on these. Meister isnt reasonable for most people but while using Krexel you can also slowly work your way toward Absolab shoulders by doing Dark World Tree dailies it gets tolerable if youre  with decent range but you will still need to find a group to clear Damien for you at some point.The only items that will land drop rate lines are your rings pendants earrings and faceeye accessories at legendary.,Maplestory,ddetl64,1,t5_2rrdo

10721424,0,t1_ddlt4mi,gtIm kind of a guild hopper  guilds or I was back when I was still super active and probably  of the guilds I joined were just the RgtGuild smegad ones. gtIf you really wanna find the right guild just join one. Im serious about that. In fact its probably better you join one that smegas or advertises here on reddit so you know at least theyre somewhat active or at least actively recruiting. Usually theyll tell you if theyre casualbossingwhatever. If youre more of a casualsocial player try to find one that isnt strictly about bossing or else thats all theyre gonna talk about which is cool for them but if thats not your thing then dont join those guilds. Personally I found more enjoyment with a smaller guild with active members. gtAfter you join one give it a bit of time. Contribute to the chat a little dont beg for runs ever respond to other people who talk that kind of thing. Usually people have their own established cliques especially if its a big guild. You might feel alienated at first but thats all part of the process. You can kinda gauge what the general atmosphere and people are like in the guild just by lurking. If youre into it just stay and try to make a contribution and eventually youll build relationships with other people. But sometimes the people will just be so god awful that you want to leave immediately. If thats the case then leave. If youve talked to some people or the guild leader it might be polite to explain why youre leaving but youre not obligated to and if you havent really said a word or anything youre probably just safe to leave. Then look for a new one. There are differences between each guild and you really just need to open the box to see what its like inside. gtYou arent going to find the right guild if you refuse to join any.

But a couple of responses in this thread indicate that using GameLauncher has a chance to ban you which might indicate that its a decently common problem. Theres a small chance Nexon might return the player to the rankings if diligent effort is made on their part... But only a small chance.

10943178,0,t3_5waxgk,You can buy the Empress armor set pretty cheaply now that the recent maple event gave them out by the butt loads. Most of them in Scania anyway can be bought for  mil or less. The set effect is better than the pensalair equipment as well. You can just  it End game is the Root abyss set which costs around  mil per piece to buy cleanly.For money you can slowly start soloing bosses with drop couponsspider familiar. This will increase the amount of drops you get from the boss. Now the drops are neat and all that but what youd want are the potions. If you only use power elixers for your bossing potions since we get shittons for free you can sell literally every potion you get for meso. If you solo a ton of bosses for the reward points you can make several millions in just potion NPCs. Through all the bosses I can solo I can make almost  mil per day just on potions and extra equips that I dont care about like bad potential CHT pendants and helmets from zakum. ,Maplestory,de8pmkw,1,t5_2rrdo

Because of that even though they can be top of the pack in theoretical dps they actually have consistently low dps with their inconsistency. Their bossing mobility is quite lackluster. All the have is moonwalk and a weak flash jump. Definitely not bad since they can movejump while hurricane but theres better classes.Evan is a monster bossing and mobbing.

In the low levels you will be changing from training spot frequently enough to rarely amass  combos and the tier one marbles are relevantly inferior to Mercedes and even to Evan. Combo Marbles fixed scaling begins to get worst starting with level  mobs and does not scale off from burning fields neither. In the case of Reboot it does not scale with the doubled base experience rendering it relatively worthless there.In around  months we should get the last KMS update which introduces the tier four marbles and also prevents the lost of combo during the random portals which should make the Aran link skill actually great but until then it is really an optional link at best.,Maplestory,dfslldu,4,t5_2rrdo

Total lines being between .Then add in the rank which can be rare epic unique or legendary. That being said the core difference between Potentials and Bonus Potentials are how they are approached. They differ on the cubesscrollscarvers you can use on them which is usually mentioned on the item details. Bonus potential related items are usually blue and the way to cube them generally is using the green colored cube in the cash shop.

11722377,0,t1_dgocx60,It helps to have another monitor set up to your computer so you can have maple in one screen and whatever youre watching on another. Playing in windowed mode you would set whatever you want to watch up to play then you continue farming.Otherwise youd have to farm on your computer and have another laptopiPadTablet set up to watch something.Or if you dont really mind small videos you can set maple to windowed x resolution and have the video or whatever off to the side of your screen.,Maplestory,dgorffm,1,t5_2rrdo
11723674,0,t3_67adxx,Hi! funny how i was just looking thru the mapelstory website and thought about going back and trying it out. The last time i played was about  years ago. when lv. cap was still . I was a lv. hero not sure how much the game changed since then but what would be a good class that I can solo with?at this moment i am thinking of starting either Hayato since maybe i can share the items with it from my hero Kana or Angelic Buster.Any tips would be appreciated. Thanks! ,Maplestory,dgowq35,2,t5_2rrdo

Being able to stand out of blue zone in hmag with your shields flying constantly is gold. Ultimately its up to your play style. If you dont use shield chasing at all and dont feel comfortable with your frenzy feel free to choose .edit a later post just clarified BD doesnt affect FC ,Maplestory,dgqh6tg,3,t5_2rrdo
