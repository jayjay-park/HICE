8569109,0,t3_4x51js,As far as I can tell there is an upper limit for cars of a higher tier.  For example a tier  can race against tier two cars up to a very specific pp limit.  After that it will only face tier  cars and any tier  cars within that limit.  If that makes sense.  There might be more ranges and limits within specific tiers as well.  So that a stock tier  will not face a maxed out tier two.The trick to being faster than other cars within your pp range is tuning and ep points.  There is no limit to matching against others with ep points.  If that makes sense,CSRRacing2,d6cpwtz,1,t5_3f9xo

9310660,0,t1_d8w22kz,I see that a lot in cars like the GTR or the McLarens. The have a launch RPM close to max but if you lug the engine let the RPMS drop to  you can get a better launch. Even then I might just skip first sift right into second and hit the NOS. Even with cars like the Ferrari F the launch RPM is so slow it make first to long.  Better to over rev the car and launch at a higher RPM.Even then there are cars with such fast shifts that I just sift and could care less of I hit the green zone.  There are a few cars you must drive perfectly but that being said what is the perfect time to use the NOS.  I found that some cars are better to hit NOS right away and some like the R work better with a late NOS.  Its not exactly a crap shoot of you experiment but there are those few time you do something wrong and get an amazing time.

11123443,0,t3_5ypzg2,This applies to any tier.  You will eventually need  cars per tier to finish out Tempest since at this point the assumption is there will be a total of  tempest rounds.  The cars you should be using for the time trials are the slowest cars you have in that tier that are still fast enough to beat the trial.Since time trial cars get a  permanent RP bump if you have multiple maxxed out cars in a tier you can probably burn one of them on a time trial so you have the RP bump on a car you really need it for like for instance your primary Live racing cars.Assuming of course that they ever fix the bug that strips cars.,CSRRacing2,desu00u,1,t5_3f9xo

11324621,0,t1_dffj66p,The best way is probably thru completing the  personal trophy challenges. They cycle thru different challengesprizes but several of them offer  gold upon completion. After that earning it from the season trial cup and also from daily challenge races and then leveling up usually  gold when that is the prize. Honestly though my best strategy is to not spend gold on anything but fuel refills when trading live races. Dont waste it on buying parts speeding up deliveries or unnecessary part stripping and you will be amazed how quickly it will pile up. I almost never drop below  gold and when I do its because I needed to use a big chunk for stripping parts or something like that. ,CSRRacing2,dffml2e,1,t5_3f9xo

But to answer your question as weve had players slow down and burn out weve created other crews for them so they can remain a part of the ODIUM family.  Many wanted to slow down but didnt want to leave so we created crews that play at all levels.  We have players who once earned over  mil who now play on a crew that only requires k per season.Anyhow good luck to you guys!,CSRRacing2,dfot8di,1,t5_3f9xo

Today I had  keys and a lot of bronze keys so I tried your method and nope did not get it then I decided Ill buy keys since I have iTunes credit that I dont use and got the lt on second pull and the first was a  star Porsche. The thing is on the huayra season I wasnt really active on the game and when last season started I tried to get the Acr I got it on second pull also kept pulling keys and got  or  Acr.  s season I was very active and made like .m rp and was racing a lot and ranking up fast also my goals tab became empty cuz I was finishing my goals fast so its now empty plus  silver keys and no prestige car.
