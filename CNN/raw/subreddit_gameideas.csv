There could be some benefit to letting the humans survive for a certain amount of time so they can worship you and give you points there but you have to balance letting them live  killing them off with the worship points so they dont expand too quickly but you still maintain an income from them.  You could spend those points at a certain cost to send cataclysmic natural events fuck with their stock market or introduce evil Hitlerish ideologies to make them kill each other.  The end game would be letting them live long enough to gather enough worship points to cause a  end of days event,gameideas,ch5ejx4,2,t5_2rh2b

2865459,0,t1_cntsup7,Thats good then.Dont expect much to come of this post though.  This subreddit works for posting ideas but asking for ideas is basically pointless.  People already post what they have.If youre looking for more you might check out rincrementalgames as some people post their ideas there.  Theyre generally lowquality since people almost always create their own ideas if theyre good.More advice  Look at things in real life and watch for incremental things.  Financial things are pretty obvious as are business things.  Watch for things in movies and books as well as the hot news of the day.Finally  Most clickers are based on a premise that would be ridiculous in reality.  Cookie Clicker for instance is based on making more cookies than could ever be done in ways that are just ridiculous.  And yet its very much loved.

3747672,0,t1_cqjfo5u,The problem is that there is nothing good on level below  tiling  the only hyperbolic tiling flatter than that is  which has cells of very different sizes another problem altogether.I think that  SHOULD work but heres the thing HyperRogue is AFAIK first hyperbolic game that fully utilizes the geometry without resorting to things like artificial boundaries of the game world etc. I believe that hyperbolic geometry can be used in more ways and for more types of games but the whole territory is almost completely unexplored.One thing that gives me hope is that in HyperRogue you are always moving and exploring new places which means that even now it probably has to hold significantly more location data than a strategy game would since exploration would be much slower there.I also like the way youve used purely vector graphics since sprites dont work in a game where cells can appear smaller larger or deformed and in any orientation  any hyperbolic game with graphics will probably need that.,gameideas,cqjgk95,1,t5_2rh2b

4185921,0,t1_crxe1jr,Usually the big parts of a game idea are the least useful ones.Looking at most entries here on gameideas there are a lot of survival MMO games based on an existing IP. Take away the MMO and the IP and theres nothing left thats actually Unique about the idea. Thats not a new game idea its just mashing together a few old ideas.If you can strip away the big parts and still have something unique as a tiny game then THAT is a great concept.E.g. Bullets only move when you do is a SUPERHOT game idea get it?. If that beautiful seed idea gets buried under the dream cruft of making it an MMO sandbox then the idea is wasted.Its easy to take a tiny game idea and scale it up by adding features.

4845445,0,t3_3h869d,I think a political game about being a royal in a house would be fun but there are already many strategy games that contain elements of what you describe. I dont know if you ever played something like Crusader Kings  . Most Paradox games like civ games but unlike AOE simulate battles with large stacks of units  they essentially boil down to watching various rounds play out in the form of textually described battle actions and shifting strength bars.The Total War games have the combination of grand strategic and battlefield tactical combat youre talking about I think unless you meant the fight system would be hack and slash firstthird person style rather than RTS.And I think this game idea would be much more appealing if it had been presented without the GoT stuff. I honestly think this ought to be a sidebar rule  it seems almost every other idea is some version of Wouldnt it be cool to have a game set in X universe? although I do appreciate that you have elaborated more than most with your original thinking. These kinds games will never be made except as mods and there is no reason their underlying mechanics cant be applied to a new original universe. So thats what I encourage you to do with this idea. And as it becomes separated from GoT you may find the real personal themes you want to explore in an interactive way and that will change the gameplay mechanics. Simply imagining that you are in X established fictional universe and its fun hardly even qualifies as an idea. Although again Im mostly speaking to others here and I do see you have added more of your own here. But I do think that without the GoT trappings right now this game sounds too similar to lots of games and you will need to really think about novel mechanics or unique ways to apply established mechanics.I went into probably too much detail about someone elses idea I found very interesting and I think your game might be suited to a similar system. In almost every strategy game youre watching the gameworld from heaven like god and ordering your peons about telepathically. I think it would be tremendous fun to explore the actual mechanics of medieval warfare down to their grittiest details and universes like GoT and your original one Im sure could really show off their grimdark if explored in this way.

7295994,0,t1_d271aw1,Thanks for the feedback!  I am also sorry I didnt think my answers were going to turn out so long.  There has been a lot more of the game thought through I was debating editing or creating a new post with a more detailed description about the game but thatll happen another day.  To answer your questions Some of the ghost I would really want to have their own whole side story but I am not sure about it.  Others will have been people who were killed and forced to help by the main spirit.  The main spirits story will date back to when the city was small.  He was one of the people to help boost the city a man who was nice to anyone and loved by everyone.  Just as the city started to boom people started to go missing.  There was no clear pattern or motive just random disapearance.  The man was sinking tons of money into search parties police force and things to help the families.  In the end none of the people were found and the man died of old age saying his greatest regret was not being able to unmask the greatest psychopath leaving his name a mystery for eternity.  Upon his last wishes a small catacomb was built on his property where he was then burried.  Later on in time it was discovered this man was the one kidnapping and killing everyone.  With fear that no one would want to live in a city that was built around a man who killed people the catacombs were sealed off his name was dropped from every history book and paper and he was forgotten.  His spirit came back with the sole purpose of killing the investigator who found him out but was stuck on his own property.  So he started killing the tenants of the house trying to grow stronger. Sorry for the confusion I didnt even notice when I wrote it it should probably read Spirit of a Hunter.  That spirit would probably be one of them that has the simple backstories spirit killed him while he was livinghunting? there.  Although that does make me think that having an actual spirit hunter show up would be a fun twist.  A possible helpful NPC. So in total there would be  things the player will have to maintain.  Health  hitpoints based on difficulty sanity breathing level battery charge Probably wont have to charge it on easy. Im still debating on that one.  I dont even know if I should have that kind of enemy.  Especially with a battery life it would force the player to go back inside to recharge the phone therefore undoing all the progress that was made.  A workaround is that the player would have to find a blackroom that shows pictures with the door that the ghost stands in front of and that when the picture is taken he leaves. He would actually be dead I used possessed to more or less explain what I think it should look like.  Your description of the boy would be spot on for that though. I was thinking that some of the spirits in the side missions could play a role in the ending or cause an alternate ending but I havent thought them all through.  One possible thing I did think of was at the end of the game there will be a scene where the player is in the catacomb and it starts to collapse.  In the main ending part of the ceiling would hit the player causign them to limp.  This would make escaping harder because they can no longer sprint.  However I was thinking if the player saved the dog spirit hell hound that it would come running in and push the player out of the way.  Now the player would have  extra feet and still have to get up but at least they could run. It will take place at night and there will be very little lighting the house has been abandoned for years.  There will be enough light coming in through the windows for the player to get a general idea of the layout of rooms but it wont be enough detail for the player to look around.  Most rooms wont have working lights but the player could try.  Something like the fridge may still have a working light in it but very limited rooms will have it. The game takes place in one of the upscale neighbourhoods on the inside rim of the city.  It is an extremely large house on a gated property.  The only reason the player does not have cell service is that the spirit is blocking it out. The game would take place in the timeframe of one night.  The player arrives at the property at sundown and would be finished the game beforeat sunrise. The player does not have any information yet.  Basically you just got a call about this property going up for rent and if you the player go there and evaluate it you get first dibs on selling it.  The player automatically jumps at it when they hear the address because they know the area is multimillion dollar properties.  So the player does not pick up the other information on the house before heading there. Well I was thinking of the player finding out  some information from papers or a book somewhere in the house but maybe if I add in the actual spirit hunter he could learn it from them. Yes! The player can leave doors open and it will lessen the chance that those rooms would be part of the next room mix up.  However the spirit may close some doors or a door might get closed when a spiritghost entersleaves a room.  Anything small enough to move but too big to pick up will be able to be pussed and pulled by the player.  So something like a desk could be used to stick in the doorway.  This would force the door to stay open which would help the player not feel so confused but it would also be loud to do and would draw attention.  Aternative ways out of the house no.  There are specific rooms that will have doors that lead outside.  However if a player gets themself trapped in a bedroom with a walk in closet they could go in there shut the door and wait until the room changes.  Being in a closet though chances are you are just going to end up in another bedroom. As explained neither of those two enemies were supposed to be alive just bad explaining on my part.  I dont want to allow the player to use weapons.  One of the main reasons I went with enemies that are spirits would be so that it made sense the player couldnt really fight back.  I want the player to really choose between hiding and running.Suggestions. We are good there it is in the plan There will be ways to help the player out.  They will be able to catch their breath which will also help with their sanity level.  Getting a sip of water or splashing your face would also make really good ways it would also work in the bathrooms.   That is exactly what I want with the side missions.  They will be long and more difficult.  The player wont find out much when they start it so they will have to find out how they died where and how to set the spirit free. I do think I would go with the idea of the player taking the charger and the possibility of leaving it behind.  And if it is left behind it would be fun to add in the chance of the two items being moved to another room. I know! The only other thing I thought of was some time of energy bar to help with the healthsanity but those would only be found in kitchen area and maybe a bedroom drawer for those people who like to snack late at night.  But yeah no chance of one sitting on the back of a toilet. For sure main things would always be left in the same spot. As I mentioned above your description of the boy was spot on what was in my head.  Definetly some creepy graphics.  The other thing I was thinking of was adding more visuals in when the sanity bar gets low when the player starts going crazy.  I was thinking maybe the player starts seening  second flahes of blood on the wallfloors a faint representations of the spirit in human form that form murdering some of the people in the backstories.  None of these things would be harmful to the player just there to add depth to the sanity.  The player could walk right through one of these scenes but it obviously wouldnt help his sanity.  They would start hearing more screaming and possibly start seeing doors that lead no where.,gameideas,d27i6qx,1,t5_2rh2b

Aliens come down from space to invade earth and the Earth Defense Force capture an alienmechasuit which for Anime Plot Reasons youre the only person capable of piloting it but you brush them off to study for your exams. A mysterious haunted artifact is left to you in a will by family you didnt know you had but you just sort of toss it in your room and go on with your day while everyone around you gets possessedstarts acting weird..A game where every week is a New Anime st Episode where you play the protagonist only with the goal of avoiding all things that are not standardnormal. You just want to grow up to get a decent paying job and start a family but the world keeps throwing at you crazier and crazier situations that you do your best to avoid..editso obviously immediately after I posted that I found what I was looking for this is the idea I meant where the gameplaystory could be part youtryingtoavoidbecomingaprotagonist part beingcompletelyoblivioustothecrazysituationsgoingonaroundyou.,gameideas,d2c5qwi,3,t5_2rh2b

7535174,0,t3_4iiwh1,So if you have no simulation tokens and start playing the game there is no game play for you for the next couple of days?  That seems weird to me new players should be a focus of your design.I do like the idea of a limited number of hubs and the server as a whole works together to clear those hubs out.  The situation here is that there isnt much of a desire to clear a hub besides loot.  There has to be some sort of objective in my opinion. Take Realm of the Mad God for example.  That is a game that seems endless but there is a timer.  After a certain point the whole server is shoved into a single dungeon and is forced to take on a massive boss.  Your game could be similar in the sense that clearing these gateways leads you to something greater a bigger event.Im not sure how you work with players to keep loot regulated keep new and old users in the same area without low level users feeling useless or where a user will gain a full sense of achievement.From what I am understanding you want to take the Procedural portion of no mans sky which is a huge huge undertaking depending on the application.  I would use that phrasing Procedural instead of No Mans Sky plenty of other games use it Minecraft Eve Online ect.  ,gameideas,d2ypntc,1,t5_2rh2b

7889421,0,t3_4mvqsy,Ive been working on a horrorpuzzle game idea so let me know what you think. The game focuses around phobias. You are a man with Panphobia a fear of everything so you volunteer for an experimental exposure therapy. Youre given a cocktail of hallucinogenic drugs that forces you to work your way through a series of mental challenges focusing around a specific phobia. The whole thing seems like one continuous dream though so the immersion doesnt get screwed up constantly by some real world plot.One obvious example is aquaphobia which would be a watertemple style raise the water level puzzle with lots of areas where you almost run out of breath. The idea is less about jump scares and more about emphasizing the theme of the level like claustrophobia or nyctophobiafear of the dark to make players anxious as they try and solve the puzzles.,gameideas,d42ue3c,1,t5_2rh2b

8071127,0,t1_d4n9fo6,Yeah I mean Im running into the issue of giving the player freedom.You dont want to only allow the player to sit behind a bar and work their ass off every day but at the same time how can you give freedom to someone who is supposed to be working?My thought was something kinda similar but a bit quicker.  You start out collecting items and selling them but you soon realize that your making nexttonothing.  You talk to your best friend Or another friend character and they suggest selling the stuff yourself.  You set up a little market stall in town and sell your goods for a meager price.  Things start to happen you meet some new people make some new friends and eventually as a gift one of your richer friends gives you a deed to a tiny little store.I think my little issue is I LOVE micromanaging and making a bunch of complex systems which I know I dont have the ability to make right now.  Like I want to make the player choose how to display their items where the displays go set the exact price of every item etc.  I think too grandly.  Im trying to make something thats Triple A quality as my first game.What I think would be really cool and add some replayability would be adding Skill and Story trees.  For instance you can upgrade displays to hold certain things or look nicer and attract more people.  For stories Im thinking make them Choose your own adventure like.  For instance with the scene you described where your friends purse is stolen you could choose to help to do nothing or to simply shout.  Each one would lead to different stories and different relationships with other characters.  Like maybe if you had your rich friend hate you he wouldnt give you the deed and youd simply need to buy it.And thinking about a game less mechanically is a great thing.  Its a special thing not many people can do.TLDR Im trying to make the next Undertale or Rimworld when I should be making the next PacMan,gameideas,d4n9rwr,1,t5_2rh2b

I personally may not support this kind of mechanic in games but given GWs recent habits Id bet theyd be all over it.On the plus side it might be a good excuse for them to finally bring back some of their specialist games.  E.G.

11100030,0,t1_depovc5,The draw distance is actually an issue Id say. I remember a minecraft game where I tried do a bit of exploring and build watch towers to scout fromuse as landmarks... I quickly realized that even with the distance turned up to max I just couldnt see far enough for it to matter. The radius a landmark is visible from is just too small compares The distance you can walk in a minuteI also think a procedurally generated world is actually probably not right for this... you want individual features that seem unique. ,gameideas,deq6g2r,1,t5_2rh2b
11105888,0,t3_5xyzkf,Saved much to think about. I love the concept of simultaneous turn based youve laid out as opposed to real time play.I believe dispute resolution would become its own inane metagame for many veterans so I have detailed five alternative resolution systems.. Simple solution at the proper depth  disputes always fail. Are cards and resources consumed or not? If this option seems reasonable you may want to playtest it to determine consumption rather than arbitrarily decide on something.. Simple solution at the proper depth  disputes always succeed. Example One player is trying to destroy a unit the other is trying to buff that unit which also would take it out of destruction range. Target is destroyed and gets buffed perhaps for one last attack.. Simple solution regardless of depth disputes bounce off each other which are reflected back at the player or player mitigation things in play. Example One player is trying to destroy a unit the other is trying to buff that unit which also would take it out of destruction range. The destroy spell is reflected and player takes damage equal to the units final HP that would have been lost. The buff spell is reflected and the player now inflicts the specified damage if attacked.. Complex procedural solution disputes form a combolatent effect. Example One player is trying to destroy a unit the other is trying to buff that unit which also would take it out of destruction range. Destruction is put into a special cycle setup with the buff so destruction is modified by the buff which is also modified by the destruction. Destruction card is now buffed with extra damage to the opponent and the buff card adds in a new destroy target ability. Target dies targets owner takes damage targets target has to deal with the new attack damage and targets target may also get destroyed.. Sort of a headache ruleset solution all cards have dispute resolution rules. I could see people setting up dispute decks if you did this.Ill try to get back with a critique of the concept itself. Hope you make this!,gameideas,dequcpw,1,t5_2rh2b
