8038396,0,t3_4p9qfy,Prayers are slightly different. My nonacademic take on it is that there are greater differences within the Shiah than there are between ers and Sunnis. Im Sunni and I own a er Shiah translationcommentary of the Quran. Its striking to me how often the footnotes say This is about Ali and his family. I dont think any part of the Quran is specifically about Ali. But Alis successorship to Muhammad is the foundation for their belief in the authority of the Imams and in turn following Imams vs following one of the Sunni schools accounts for our doctrinal differences.,IslamicStudies,d4jladj,3,t5_2sh8y
