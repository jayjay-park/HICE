4236493,0,t1_cs34jnv,gt From my first post but lots of other subreddits that didnt have names starting with fatpeoplehate were also banned.Come on. You have to be trolling at this point. They were banned because there is no doubt whatsoever that they were related to FPH. There is no argument here. What are you ?gt So how exactly do I go about organizing a group of people on reddit to discuss our shared hatred for fat people then? Thats for you to figure out on your own. Certainly not right after the original sub was banned. Im not here to help people figure out how to discuss their vitriolic behavior in a manner that wont get them banned.Or maybe go to a different website if you so vehemently disagree with the admins actions. I hear voat.co is super popular.,InflateGate,cs35fvm,-4,t5_38m3r
