5994467,0,t3_3xbbcf,These guys take eugenics very seriously look at what happened to the people who couldnt use cantus.   People who misbehave have a chance to wipe out humanity people who are crippled can dilute the gene pool.  My theory is that back when cantus wasnt universal there was a rigid class division between users and non users see the first few episodes. This high stress environment increases the odds of ogres and karma demons being created.   Now when you look at the general historic knowledge the average person has this information was likely losthidden to the general public and only available to the select few.   After generations of this logic being implemented it eventually became a public norm or cultural practice like the fear of spiders most people have never witnessed a dangerous spider attack but are afraid anyway due to being raised by and being around people with the same fear who also had no experience with a dangerous spider.   Tldr its a Societal practice born of logic and continued by a culture of fear of the unknown as well as limited knowledge of the pastSorry for the shity mobile formating and lack of proofreading Note if youve ever read The Giver its kind of the same concept with the whole if every one is the same then everyone is equal  concept ,shinsekaiyori,cy5elhe,2,t5_34fyj
