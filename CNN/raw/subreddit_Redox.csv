8445257,0,t3_4vbr7t,Writing software for Redox isnt that much different from writing it for Windows or Linux as long as you write it in Rust.You should try mailing infoatredoxos.org for an invite to the dev chatroom they helped me out a lot when I began using Rust and will accept anyone trying to make Redox better either by directly contributing or making software for it.,Redox,d5x716q,1,t5_3at99
11648546,0,t3_662t9y,What does this even mean in relation to an OS? I know Redox has done very well isolating both unsaferust and nonrust code to a relatively small portion of the code base.Are you asking whether the code is written in an imperative vs declarative nature? I dont quite see how that matters because any modern software is a mix of both. Its rather pointless to restrict yourself to a strict subset of Rust you use what is applicable where it is applicable.I see GuixSD claims to be written in a purely functional manner but I was under the impression that Guile wasnt even purely functional like in the way that Haskell would be.,Redox,dggdknr,2,t5_3at99
