4313703,0,t3_3adqnw,Ill be surprised if we lose by less than  goals.,melbournefc,csbvpr9,1,t5_2up5e
4462961,0,t3_3c3kcv,I know weagles are top  material but I really thought these sorts of losses were meant to be happening less and less. I mean to be within  points at  qtr time only to lose by  goals is the old Melbourne way. If we want to be successful sooner than later then even the rest of the games against big teams this year should stop becoming blowouts because it resurfaces old habits ,melbournefc,cst8gx5,1,t5_2up5e
4973449,0,t3_3iya2k,I think he would be OK there are better options though and things we need more. Also it would make me feel like we were just a dumping ground for disgruntled ex Carlton and Collingwood players.,melbournefc,culfuyj,3,t5_2up5e
6741504,0,t3_47u27h,I dont want to sound insensitive but was he really that good? He played  games in  years. Regardless from an on field perspective hed probably be retired. Dude would be  this year. That said Ill never forget that day and I feel for the poor wife. Glad she made the most of his legacy. ,melbournefc,d0gmnxf,2,t5_2up5e
7194821,0,t3_4e0hg8,Im looking forward to the Collingwood game moreso than this weeks Norf game thats for sure. Having said that we are Melbourne. You cant really bank on wins. I recommend hanging with your dad to watch the game anyway. If we lose at least youll have each other to cry with!,melbournefc,d1vzq2u,2,t5_2up5e
7832009,0,t3_4mh6ig,I think the backline was fairly solid throughout the game yet some defensive lapses cost us some crucial goals against. Frost played well down back however we played one too many talls for a wet day. Grimes has been sitting in the VFL all season and another good game today surely means he should be picked after weeks of solid form. Our defence recently has been leaky and having grimes as a rebounding halfback and Dunn as another experienced defender down back would improve the team drastically.Dawes was trying all game but couldnt get his hands on the ball much I like his pace and aggression however I do not expect him to stay in the side with performances like that.The midfield once again showcased how good they really are with Viney out Vince immediately stepped into the midfield with  touches and had a large impact when we were on top. Dom Tyson remains under the radar as one of the better midfielders in the competition and Jones is simply as always phenomenal.Disappointing we couldnt finish it off in the last quarter wouldve been a very special moment to knock them off.With Collingwood in good form as of late we need to bring our best next week to stay in touch with the . ,melbournefc,d3wdvsj,2,t5_2up5e
8208619,0,t3_4rnnjc,Pretty happy with the changes actually. Grimes earnt his spot most definitely. Dawes was beyond rubbish last week and with the likely greasy conditions I think dropping a tall was a good move. With White I think they need to give him a run to see whether he is worth keeping or not. I want to see  or  games now with him in the side. No point dropping him next week. He was good in the one game he has played at senior level. Can actually kick which is huge for us. ,melbournefc,d53mrr4,3,t5_2up5e
10936131,0,t1_de7zcz1,who goes out for Tyson then? damn.. thats a hard decision.I dont believe we have anyone on the long term injury list Lumumba is retired and the only injury I can think of is Wagner from the first JLT  but hes only missing a month so we cant drop him.,melbournefc,de7zgzo,1,t5_2up5e
11596232,0,t3_65hqlb,Disappointing but not the end of the world. This game was always going to be tight given our outs and their momentum from beating the reigning premiers last week. I think we showed plenty of heart to get back in front it really was an amazing last quarter and with a bit of luck we wouldve won. Our lack of forward targets was painfully obvious. Weideman just isnt ready to be the main guy up there. Getting Hogan back will be huge for us. ,melbournefc,dgafwee,5,t5_2up5e
