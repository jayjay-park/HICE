Its also one of the few files still served by Microsoft that can be downloaded directly from its URL without having any cookies or redirection headers set.Incidentally for these reasons and given the almost total absence of Wink boxen in production environment Id imagine it would not be unreasonable to monitor web traffic for requests for that file as a flag indicating a compromised machine.,itsaunixsystem,cigt1z7,27,t5_2xxaq

The database machine neednt know about the salt or  the logic around hashing.So yes at some point some machine did know the plain password and the salt but if security is much of a concern that isnt the same machine that stores the hashes.,itsaunixsystem,cqsmms7,1,t5_2xxaq

7982121,0,t1_d0ourc1,Halt and Catch Fire was a euphemism we used decades ago for a few reserved instructions in the  processor that were for testing the processor in the factory.  It put them in a tight microcode loop I forget why but it was intended that the sequence never be hit accidentally and that the processor be reset shortly after the test.    However if you did accidentally execute the sequence the processor stopped fetching and got stuck in this loop and got hot until reset.  It did not actually catch fire though.  Hence the Halt and Catch Fire instruction.,itsaunixsystem,d4d9kr3,1,t5_2xxaq
