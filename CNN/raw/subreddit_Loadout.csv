238515,0,t1_cf5f3az,Good arguments thanks.Indeed it wouldnt make sense to invest into a lot of overhead just for lauchweek like i wrote about in my original post. The point I was trying to make which I apparently did a poor job of is about communication not the lack of hardware which im totally fine with. I agree that we should apply different standards to established franchises although I dont think there was no reason to expect this game to stand out from an oversaturated crowd. The game exudes quality and polish and other fp shooters such as planetside  Warframe Tribes Ascend etc... at least garner a healthy amount of attention at launch.From a completely personal perspective based on preview footage my initial impression was that this game would become popular which it did. Im not saying im great at predictions which im not just that it may have colored my current perspective. I dont wish to come across harshly but the excuse came across as dishonest to me at least. Anyway I dont wish to make a big deal out of this either. I just ended a really fun couple of matches after finally being able to play.

There is so much left to explore in the game and so many different options now is the worst time to discuss balance because we dont actually have any idea about what might actually be overpowered or the different combinations that are possible. To find these things out you need a consistent mode that youre balancing the game around along with a good amount of time to see how the meta revolves around that mode and the different maps.

293662,0,t3_1x7pq3,How are you handling the bolt action on your sniper rifle? I attempted some straight sniper builds such as    Rifle Standard Stock Recon Scope Sniper Barrel Semi Auto Bolt Action     In my experience though the damage you gain does not offset the loss in magazine capacity and refire speed. My current build for sniper is really more of a DMR than a traditional sniper and is    Rifle Standard Stock Recon Sniper Barrel Semi Auto Shell Loading Mag    In my experience the extra rounds and refire rate makes this a far superior weapon to the bolt action version and allows me to get a kill in  hits. I pair this with a LMG build and end up cleaning house in most casual MM games.    Rifle Standard Stock Iron Sights Light Assault Full Auto High capIs there something Im missing about the bolt action sniper rifles? Im not sure if they arent any good until upper levels or if they just dont suite my playstyle. Additionally is there much benefit on the stocks?

Its not like TF where having visibly attained cosmetics is required for other players to take you seriously Ill admit I dont like to uber anyone that doesnt have at least a hat.  Since you can do everything in the game they are fairly justified in charging what they want for the completely unessential.  Unlike MWO where it takes a truly excessive grind to obtain enough ingame currency to make a chassis viable in a regular match even if you buy them for cash and your available chassis greatly determine your effectiveness ingame.  No amount of skill can make up for the lack of gear whereas the benefits of experience dont drastically make a player more effective not in comparison to good aiming dodging and basic weaponcrafting.,Loadout,cfq1uch,1,t5_2tm6l

467426,0,t3_1zewba,An obvious nerf would be making the Sniper barrel give the Beam chassis some scatter if youre not scoped.  Every other chassis becomes nighunusable when hipfired with a Sniper barrel the fact that Beam doesnt is why its an OP combo.  The change would keep the longrange strength which a Beam Sniper should have and at midclose range it would still be powerful but a lot harder to use.Either that or Sniper just shouldnt be available on Beam.Another possible nerf to all Beam weapons would be reverse damage falloff have some part of the beam closest to the gun that is unfocused or something and only deals some percentage of the full damage.  That distance could change with barrels.  Might even open the door to Scatter barrels or something similar on Beam.,Loadout,cftec0f,5,t5_2tm6l

640437,0,t1_cgd0kyq,Your first post which I based my troll assumption on had none of that info. The second one was half the length before you edited it well after my reply. I do like the test environment idea you edited in there though. My worry with it is if some teams know whats coming they get to adjust to it instantly when live so where do you draw the line for who gets the invites? ,Loadout,cgd2gyl,0,t5_2tm6l

673237,0,t1_cggpq4o,It took forever to get people to cooperate. I usually just pop a shield and roll away trying to survive. Maybe firing a rocket or two behind me to see if I can finish someone off.That all usually fails. XDBut thanks D I didnt think many people would like this.

678404,0,t1_cggvtxq,Just to be the devils advocate I guess I could see the double barrel performing well with a Juice or Heals launcher. Mainly because it loads like a shellloading magazine. Meaning you could still fire your launcher after reloading the first rocket enabling you to react to healsjuice for your team much quicker. But Ive never tried it myself. Maybe tonight.
