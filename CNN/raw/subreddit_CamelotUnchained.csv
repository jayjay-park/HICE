Yeah you can kill an oponent using skills but it looks ugly and your character looks ugly and your weapons are ugly and everything around you is still work in progress. They build their engine in house so you cant compare it with a game using a gameengine like unity or cryengine.

There will be less Healers than Non Healers. if there are any AOE healing spells they are very likely to be less effective than single target heal spells. There is a chance that there are no AOE heal spells that effect members outside of the healers group.

10778357,0,t1_ddrpfn0,Without control of certain objectives there are no fights.  If you dont have a town to return to where crafters are safe to repair your gear crafting ammunition and siege weapons and likely crafting whatever is necessary for the temporary respawn location mechanic its going to be absurdly hard to go on the offensive anywhere.  Youre going to have to defend critical objectives at some point.  Theyre more than set pieces that give you points when the colors change.  They actually house support functions and they actually function as force multipliers.  Objectives in this game arent going to be like anything in any other game to date.  Theres no impenetrable home base  minutes from the fight you reliably respawn at... you NEED those objectives if you want to fight at all.Which objectives you control is going to determine how far you have to run to get to the fight and which ways you can approach from.  Who controls what keep where and how secure it and what services it provides is likely going to be a huge factor in who wins fights in the longterm.  You will desperately want your realm to hold on to certain strategic keeps.  Plus doesnt your guild want a place to store materials for crafting gear repairs and craft their own siege weapons?  A place for your crafters to put down their Vox for long term crafting projects?  Unless your guild just plans to forgo crafters and buy everything it needs or force them to run halfway across the map daily its going to be practically necessary for you to hold land somewhere and with no fast travel the safer it is the less convenient it is to get to from the frontlines.  I suppose if your guild is ok with what objectives it can attack being up to the whims of your where your realm mates decide to build and never being in control of the town you are based out of then you can probably get away with just focusing on fights.Besides arent the best fights over something you actually care about?
