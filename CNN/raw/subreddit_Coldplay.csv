537524,0,t1_cg1d8d8,Oh absolutely. The thing that turned me off the most about Magic was the simple almost hokey lyrics that just seemed thrown together to a beat. The music felt akin to the instrumentals of The Album Leaf and the lyrics felt uninspired and like they followed a mad libs type structure replacing words at the end of sentences with different ones that only served to make it rhyme. I am slow to judge this album becausw it is new and I dont know much yet but quick to notice things like this.

Im pretty sure it is though he loves coldplay and has been remixing and throwing their songs into his sets forever. If true Im so stoked.

945239,0,t3_24xxlg,Overrated There really arent many underachieving Coldplay songs but one that comes to mind for me is Clocks. Maybe I just dont get the hype but its a good song. I wouldnt classify it as one of their best however. Underrated Now for this category there are plenty of songs to choose from. My choice would have to be Us Against the World. Being that its off of MX I think it gets overlooked when compared to tracks from their earlier days. But the emotional rawness and simplicity of the song always gets to me  even if the rest of the album is drastically different. I liken it as an equal to tracks like Til Kingdom Come but again thats my opinion. Im curious to see what you guys think. ,Coldplay,chbqapv,17,t5_2qmkl

986688,0,t3_25e4au,. O . Anothers Arms . Ink . Midnight  Actually wasnt a fan when it was first released but in the context of the album it just feels so beautiful.. True Love . Oceans . . Always In My Head .. Magic . ASFOS .Honestly might be my favorite Coldplay album. The whole thing in completion is just fantastic I wish I could have rated Always In My Head higher but in relation to others on the album I just couldnt. Midnight feels so natural where it is on the album and ASFOS is so perfect right after Oceans. The transition interlude between the two was so full of grace and the drop into ASFOS came as a total shock to me. This album might actually be perfect I cant believe what theyve done. Every single song feels so personal and Ive never had an album where literally album reaches me like this.OVERALL ALBUM RATING .,Coldplay,chgg00z,1,t5_2qmkl

9837708,0,t3_5g52qr,Im in agreement without of things already posted on here but I remember reading a comment back when the album first came out about the last minute of the song.  The last  seconds is just so wonderful. Every aspect the guitar with the sweet twang on it the bass drums the strings everything just fits together so well! I especially love the lyricalmusical build up I literally imagine myself as a bird. It goes in my head like this.You said well gooooooo through this together ohhhhhhh This is the part where I jump out of the nest and kinda am in a nose dive soaring towards the ground my buddy is right next to me since were through this together. And thenWhen you flyyyyyyyy wontttttttttt youuuuuuu. Here Im racing my partner as we fly faster and faster upwards and upwards kinda like Up With the Birds I know its a stretch. And the music is really climaxing along with both Chris and Will really belting out a wonderful harmony as the strings blare in the background. Its such a wonderful climax that really puts me over the edge. I think the music and lyrics really blend beautifully here.And then it ABRUPTLY ENDS with COOL! Sure the lyrics say cool but we all know its a damn BIRD pun! When I first heard it it took me out of the moment so badly but I have grown love it. I just imagine that my magical bird journey has ended with me flying into a tree or something. Anyway its my favorite song from AHFOD and the last  seconds are my ringtone. Love it! Glad to see appreciation for it on here.,Coldplay,dapvjsr,7,t5_2qmkl

9874669,0,t3_5grtu0,Aw dude your show is still going on rn must be fucking epic as always. Today is a week from my first ever CP show and Ive just started to get the nerves and excitement because I have waited so long for this show. Holy fuck am I excited. Its just going to be so incredible and I am beyond hyped for it. AHHHHH,Coldplay,dauoy23,6,t5_2qmkl
9884049,0,t1_dau59h4,I certainly agree that Fun is a terrible song definitely the worst song off of AHFOD if youre not counting fillers like Colour Spectrum. But I dont think that Tove Los addition on it was its worst feature. Its just a very bad bland song. The vocals sound decent I thought that the harmony sounded perfectly normal.,Coldplay,davwyoa,2,t5_2qmkl

Theyre great.As for the other thing I need to clarify something with people cause Im quite confused. Have different countries gotten different versions of Xylobands? Because I initially thought that all of them were like this But the one in this video is very different. And apparently that one was from the Latin American leg. Are there any other different official versions of Xylobands and where and why were they distributed like that?,Coldplay,dcu5dny,2,t5_2qmkl
10501458,0,t1_dcviix6,I know you already got this answer but just to hammer home that Twisted Logic really is the real final track take a look at the back cover of XampY It doesnt even mention Til Kingdom Come!

11067997,0,t1_demj3nk,I believe theyve gone with the samesimilar set list for pretty much all of the tour. Saw them at Wembley and it was AHFOD opening and Up amp Up closing. I personally love the three songs you mentioned but dont think they work as well for closers. I could definitely see them as encore songs but not as out and out finishers. Just my opinion though. ,Coldplay,demjp8f,3,t5_2qmkl
