3326380,0,t3_2y95ju,The razer forums and this subreddit arent exactly booming.  So the demographic is already small and the SDK group will likely be even smaller.  I can see that as more people purchase chroma gear and the number of users increase then maybe.  Right now though I really dont think its necessary.  Could just have a Flair for SDK projects.,ChromaProfiles,cp7fo3d,1,t5_35qhw

5184788,0,t1_cuzremu,I am asking for a Razer Chroma Profile that has lights on the buttons that are used for HZ. So one colour is for communication and another is for movement. Just the controls for the game to light up on the keyboard that are assigned to a category by using the same colour. Just asking if anyone would make it or if they have spear time to do something,ChromaProfiles,cvayh3x,2,t5_35qhw

8114709,0,t3_4lf10p,Sorry if this post is old but I figured out a bit of a workaround with my borderlands  profile when you press the F key all the keys except the ones you need to play the game change colors  I know that this isnt exactly what you need but its the best thing that I could think of.I made a quick mockup of what you asked for and it actually doesnt look all that bad.  Unfortunately since I have never played League of Legends before I couldnt map out all of the keys that you might need to click ingame so youll have to do that yourself. All youll need to do is clear the effects of each key that youd need to click in both layers so that you can click them without activating the ripples. This isnt perfect since when you clear the effects those keys wont light up anymore and any key that you leave with effects on will in fact light up when you press it. Hope this helps though.,ChromaProfiles,d4s60ko,1,t5_35qhw
8558502,0,t3_4wzy98,.RazerSynapse files are imported from a different menu and to be honest they are much easier than .razerchroma to import because you dont need to make a new profile and go into the configurator. To import .RazerSynapse files click import under the button with three dots shown here  Then just hit browse and find the file youre importing. The program will do the rest for you,ChromaProfiles,d6be0ue,4,t5_35qhw

11648218,0,t3_6674ro,Look in the Overwatch settings. It has been a while since I played but last I checked every character comes with a preset keyboard profile. You should be able to enable a setting that whatever character you play your keyboard will change.,ChromaProfiles,dggc8h3,2,t5_35qhw
