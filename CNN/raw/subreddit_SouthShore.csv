8238882,0,t1_d56s40v,Nice! Also near the Lucky Stars chinese place? Im hoping someone will chime in with a review of that place. Ive never dared to try it. That location is super convenient to a lot of things all the restaurants I mentioned and also the beach. Tip the beach is much quieter north of the hotel. It looks like its private in that area because of the houses but it isnt.I forgot to mention Hulls Kitchen which is on the same strip as Daddys and Barefoot Bobs. Its a tiny casual place with mainly sandwichsalad options but the food is good and you can sit on the front porch with a beer or wine and look at the waterpeople watch. It is only open in the summer and the opening date seems to be whenever the owners feel like it.,SouthShore,d57f02a,1,t5_2ua7d
