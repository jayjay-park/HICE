8127,0,t3_1u6hod,Resset? not sure i care. if it ends up giving us a better world then yes otherwise meh. i dont have much set up so it wont bother me. Gregtech? yes. i love alot of the things it adds and if id had more time to be on id love to use it and i always find it fun setting up automation using it. HardEasy? i think hard mode would be mostly pointless as other mods let us skip past it and cheat in it but i enjoyed the last time i played with it in hardmode. Honestly though with all the loud nos easy mode is good with me. BoP? not sure what it adds other than a new dimension and pretty stuff so i dont overly care. TeamsHouse plots? sure. i love the idea of a spawn we can show off and i love the idea of all the things we can do with teams and honestly well be in teams by the end anyway. id love to set up some gamesarenas and the like for everyone and maybe we can make trophys some how or something for some games. Maybe i can set up my own games and host them like an mc? would be loads of fun. I like starting from scratch so having items from the old world isnt something i care about. unless i can have my TiCo tools but that would feel like cheating. if we add any more mods may we pleas PLEASE pretty please get that mod that only half of us have to sleep to set it to day. i get tired of all the rain and trying to get people to sleep when half of them afk through the night.,KronosRR,cefd0vw,1,t5_2zcuk
