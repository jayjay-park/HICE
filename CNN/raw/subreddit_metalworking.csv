If your gate is lbs its heavier  away from that hinge so if it bounces from someone climbing it or the power goes out from a storm so the gate opens and the wind bounces it then that area of weld can tear away. so now you have the potential of the gate blocking the driveway from ambulances and fire trucks or the ability to leave your house without having to stop and pick up a driveway gate and move it out of the way...fuck that Its tear drop shaped with the tip of the tear drop for the weld location so it sometimes can be too small of a connection.  of the time its fine.

4593362,0,t3_3dwscc,Unless youre talking about a different process to the one I know by the name precipitation hardening then you cant harden  stainless that way.The precipitation hardening grades are  through .  It relies on the addition of copper molybdenum aluminium andor titanium  and  doesnt have any of those in it. is an austentitic grade steel  case hardening is not an option as the cementite formation relies on the ferritic phase.  In principle one can try to shove in enough carbon to get iron carbides in the austenite phase  but thats a huge amount of carbon to even try that   of carbon which is well past sensible.  Also no idea if the lebedurite  cementite phases would do what you want  its well outside conventional.Im afraid that if you need a tougher part in stainless you should look at remaking it in  stainless which is harder and tougher purely by being a ferritic steel or use a nonstainless hardening steel and protect it.  Precipitation hardening steels are complex beasts and if you want to go down that road you should expect a few failures before you get it to work.Note that case hardening doesnt really improve the overall strength of a part  just the surface.  Its good for abrasion and wear resistance but its not normally going to make a major difference for the sort of use case your describing.Do you have evidence that  wont be good enough for that part?  Given that you say its cosmetic it might be reasonable to just try it  the alternatives are costly in either time or materials and if it works theres no problem.,metalworking,ct9l46u,9,t5_2qkuc

5107156,0,t1_cv1l39b,Your idea isnt bad in theory but I have access to a Bridgeport mill so am willing and able to hog stuff like that out when needed.  Still a PITA doing it in steel.Might be easier to just buy some pipe with the interior radius being what you want and cut sections from that.  Combined with sheet metal skins with the same profile curve youd get close.Assuming you are making a more than few building a wood buck that can hold the inside skin and the walls the separate it from the outside skin seems a good idea.  Then you wouldnt need to machine them at all you could just bend amp tack pieces of fairly thin metal on the buck use the pipe as suggested above for the tight sections.  Making complex items like that is often MUCH easier with some such jigging.  You would not even need a full form just enough of a form to let you build  of a stool leg plus  of ring at top and bottom.  Build  of those then weld them  together.  Done that way seems worth it even if only doing a one off and it saves having to deal with making a buck that breaks down to pull out of the center of the stool.If building the buck seems like a lot of work consider this  if building it in wood is to hard do you really want to tackle doing it in metal?,metalworking,cv1lq8v,2,t5_2qkuc

7887371,0,t1_d41loxx,IF you design your mold correctly you might be able to get away with very little if any shrinkage.  Sorry I forget the technical term for it.. maybe a riser?  basically its like a sprue but sits next to your piece and is a massive area that will be filled with metal as you pour.  This area being larger than your piece will cool last.  As your piece cools it will pull molten metal from the riser? and the riser? itself will shrink and your part will have very little shrinkage.  This works becuase shrinkage happens as the part cools it actually pulls away from the mold as it shrinks but if you have more metal to feed into it as it is shrinking it ends up closer to regular size.  of course you cannot prevent all shrinkage but you may able to get it very close to original size.,metalworking,d42m3fi,2,t5_2qkuc

Line up a piece of angle iron next to that and clamp it to the workpiece at both ends so its the spacer width from your protractorcut line.Remove the spacer and make your cut running the saw along the angle iron.This would work for a few cuts but I could see it getting old real quickly.

11500234,0,t3_6450kr,gt Ive been told by rbattlebots that I need a piece of aluminum or steel round stock and a lathe. I assume you will be bolting hardened tool steel to it?  An aluminum impact weapon is kinda lame....gt How do I spin this so that I get a hole in it for the shaft that is the precise size I need it?Thats what a machining lathe is for.  You would drill the hole with a drill bit and then cut it carefully to final size with a boring bar.  This video shows such a process. gt Where would I be able to find a lathe for this like what local businessesfactories might have one? The hackerspace Im a member of has a couple in the machine shop.  Literally anybody who is in the bussiness of machining things would have something like that.  Most will have the dimensional capacity you need but drilling into the end of a  foot long by  inch diameter piece of metal on a lathe is not an easy setup.  Im not sure exactly how I would do that... I think Id have to turn down the outside to create a true round surface that could rest on a steady rest as shown in the video above.  That might mean your final part is a bit smaller than  inches or you need to buy metal larger than  inches in diameter to get a  inch part.gt Is there anywhere that would sell me  inch thick two foot long round stock?Just about any metal supply shop will.  I go to a local place called Discount Steel.  Their prices are a bit on the high side but not by much.  I keep going because they have great service and selection for my purposes anyhow and a damn good website.The only  round steel they have is L which is specifically alloyed to cut nicely on a lather or mill etc.  It can not be hardened but is tougher than aluminum and heavier obviously.  A  foot length would be  and weighs  lbs.  If you wan the final thing to be around  lbs youll be removing a lot of materialThe only  round aluminum they have is  T a good option anyhow.   feet would cost .  Yup its less than the steel  thats pretty common with big chunks because they pretty much go by weight.  Would also be a bit easier to machine and weighs lbs  so might let you hit your target without to much work.If you pay a machine shop to do the lathe work they might also be able to provide the metal.
