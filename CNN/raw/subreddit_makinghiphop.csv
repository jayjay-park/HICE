6940,0,t3_1u7c24,Try exaggerating the compression settings until you can hear them then start dialing them back slowing and listening to the change in the sound as you go. Hearing the compression turned up a ton will help identify what you need to look for when you dial in more subtle compression.Ultimately it all comes down to practice which is a lame answer but it is what it is.,makinghiphop,cef865h,2,t5_2sqw4
8462,0,t1_cefbdup,I like the kick at first but was expecting it to change as the track progressed forward to something clearer. The sounds you use including the drums sounds a bit dull.

Did you add anything besides the drums? Im trying to feel out a bassline but cant really find it. That bassline makes or breaks beats sometimes.Other then that the chops are put down nicely not super creative thats my personal opinion with it in this case but they sound clean and the drums also sound good with the sample.

I might need to rerecord them i actually played guitar on this one but it might also be the drum loop. IDK something is a bit off rhythm here. I have a few other concerns.how do I eliminate those damn pops from looping the drums and guitar samples? I want the sample to loop perfectly but obviously there is a difference between the volume at the end and the beginning which causes that annoying pop sound.should I make the drums louder? I side chained the kick to the bass and used parallel compression on everything else there are actually three drums layered two from the Maschine library and a loop from a Black Sabbath song I just dont want it to take over the mix.

The new software is dope and its pretty easy to get the hang of. As far as choosing between the mk and the mikro its really just preference.

415369,0,t1_cfnirri,Thanks for the response dude i bought a built desktop a while back and Im pretty positive its part of the problem because when I plug my setup into my laptop the noise disappears completely. My set up is a Focusrite Scarlett i interface and i run Behringer truth a monitors. The noise will only happen when I have my computer screen plugged in to my desktop and ive tried several screens.

434059,0,t1_cfp11cj,I think this track has a bit of a waiting room feel to it.  Feels like im at Macys dawg! On a real note  I think the main pad could be a different instrument something more mooganalog and a little less stocktemplate sounding.  The solo virtual harmonica can be tricky for this if you are going to present it as a template for someone to pull some vocals over.    I think the main drive of the bass can get a bit muddy because its so round in the mix maybe try it in mono to give more spaceheadroom.  If not use use some midside eq and just highpass the side up to around  hz to keep some of the wideness?Keep em steady amp best intentions.   ,makinghiphop,cfpr6xc,1,t5_2sqw4

484244,0,t3_1zn4oj,Well the drums sounds like the overheads are mixed in at a higher volume. Theres a lot of reverb on the vocalsThe main ones The vocal overdubs are the only thing that arent sitting in the middle. Everything else is in the middle since the vocals take up a lot of the sides.

638010,0,t1_cgcoh9z,lows are often an issue EQ wise. I lower about db lthz and db between hzhz. that really can help clear out the vocal. if the vocals are sounding tinny you can cut between hzkhz but just enough or youll lose a lot of that professional sounding clarity. that being said it is always more important to get your EQ right. once you feel like the vox is sounding good then worry about boosting levels and what not. its hard to explain in writing but trial and error is going to be your friend. and REALLY listen to your vox and try to point out what exactly it is youre not liking. then think of solutions to fix it or google to see if others have had similar problems  chances are they have.,makinghiphop,cgcsj9l,2,t5_2sqw4

Dont get that advice from people here its your family its your life you know the situation better then we can. Just dont make any sudden decisions and be respectful to what they say.  . Combine verses? verses are mostly  bars so if you have two verses at  when you have the beat thats... two verses still. You should really be writing the verses all together at once so they go along with eachother. Not trying to mix and match.  .  Personal preference. If your brand new you can go to the much hated and dreaded Soundclick.com but when your ready to start putting out projects def want custom beats there are some great beat makers here for starters.  I usually go in the studio once a week and get as much done as i can in that period then spend the rest of the week listening to what i did going back to edit or start working on the next.

Additionally maybe its the style youre looking for but none of the vocals have any feeling it sounds as if the vocals are just monotone droning on and not putting emphasis on anything Id recommend a rerecord and spit it like you mean it!,makinghiphop,chku3um,1,t5_2sqw4

1183524,0,t1_ci2qsyg,I like your tone!  I suggest experimenting with switching up your melodies and word spacing aka rhythm more often. Letting the music breath refreshes the listeners ears which sets them up to listen to what youre saying next more intensely.  About tones your track is so relaxed but to me it sounds like your voice is strained.  How does your body feel while youre recording?  Are your muscles predominantly tight or relaxed?  try to relax your voice.  youtube basic breath control etc.About timing Many parts of the verse feel a bit rushed to me like if you nudged it to the right ms it would marry the music better.  A common trick to giving rhymes or any rhythmic element for that matter the in the pocket feeling is to say the wordplay the note slightly later than expected.  This creates a feeling of syncopation and lets them groove harder.Overall nice song.  I enjoyed listening to it.  Id like to hear more in the future,makinghiphop,ci2rkt0,1,t5_2sqw4

1509878,0,t1_cj5is6w,Thats respectable. I totally see where youre coming from but ultimately you have to figure out where youre going to draw the line in the sand. Its a balancing act though right? How far out do I go out on the experimental sound vs. reeling it back in enough to still make it accessible?Its almost as vague as an answer to the question of AY YO HOW DO I MAKE THIS FRUITY LOOPS BEAT SOUND LIKE SOME SHIT TH WONDER DID know what I mean? Meaning striking the balance between odd sounds and something that a vast portion of your audience can appreciate is difficult at best and impossible at worst. And Im right there in the trenches with you brother. Again this is my own opinion but I would rather have too experimental over too normal because Im the type of person that wants a polarizing reaction out of the people I show music off too. I NEVER NEVER NEVER want to hear meh its alright I want you to love or hate that shit. That to me is clearer than anything because if I get a lot of love cool. If I get more reactions for the opposite end of the spectrum that means I need to look inward at what Im doing and start viewing it objectively and in that same breathe be ready to dump the track entirely if Im too far off the mark. Sorry for the wall of text but this is a meta level discussion to making music and theyre my favorite types of talks because its so opened ended. The onus is on us as producers and mcs to find that perfect balance. One that that makes us stand out from the pack but also something that you can nod your head to. SUPER QUICK EDIT I want to be the first one to point out the surface level hypocrisy in this post and the one previous to it. Really I want reactionsopinions about what I do to be gauged by the listener but I cant let everything I do be directed by casual listeners. Take a feather from every bird but never steal the entire goose type shit. I guess Ill retract what I said previously about not giving a shit about what people think. I do.

Right now the sample triggers on every down beat and the drums do exactly the same thing. Its just boring. Try switching it up a bit. Plus you really dont need to repeat everything so many times. Theres really only two main sections you keep switching back and forth between you could do it a little less and keep the beat at like  minutes long without losing anything interesting,makinghiphop,cj9q8zc,1,t5_2sqw4

The sample voice near the end sounded cool. It wasnt bumpin but definitely nice to listen to. Are you recording yourself playing drumspads live? I do like human tempo error in beats makes a beat feel more unique. Sometimes your snareclick sound would go off tempo a bit but I like it. I would try to get the kick more audible and less click. The click is on the snarechord sample it sounds like crinkling in my ear. ,makinghiphop,cjbudl0,2,t5_2sqw4

1639275,0,t1_cjl7rl3,Like another guy said some bits dont sound very good harmonically. Just be careful in keeping in your given key which Im sure youre doing but more importantly learn which degrees of the scale sound good and which ones dont. Even if everything in your beat is in c major you cant just chuck in any c major notes into a melody and have it sound good. It sound like youre going for kind of a pedal point type thing here melody stays the same while chords move up and down which is all good but you need to write those sorts of bits very carefully to make sure that you use the right bits of the scale but also that you dont make it too boring. I get that its just kinda an experiment but yeah this track doesnt justify its length hell it wouldnt even justify half its length. Something that came to mind as I was listening to this is that you could do some really cool shit with your drum patterns going off soloing in the background. I dunno it may not sound good but look up aphex twin  film if you want to know what I mean by that or what I had in my mind,makinghiphop,cjlsnhx,2,t5_2sqw4

I usually always throw a Soft Knee master on the master track maybe make some lowhigh end adjustments and then change my limiter threshold to  and boost my limiter gain up a few dbs.I dont consider it really mastering the track but more or less getting the track to a quality listening volume for exporting to Soundcloud.,makinghiphop,ckde1zu,1,t5_2sqw4

Its just money you can put away a little every week without disturbing your lifestyle too much and there will always be more money later on provided you get it duh.Do you know how aggravating it is to run up against the limitations of your gear? It fucking blows. And one day  if you are serious about following this path and use cutrate gear  it will happen. And you will be furious. Youll feel crippled. Maybe youll realize the machine you cut your teeth on has too much internal noise or is no longer supported by the company and those worn out pads can never be replaced. Maybe youll be ready to kick up your songs to the next level and you wont be able to. Maybe youll be limited by sampling time The Octatrack supports  gigs of samples FYI  DAYS of music and realize you cant realize your vision. Fuck that go all in. I say this after  years of working and performing with average gear. Its why I have  ESXs  Not enough sample time on a single ESX. Its why Ive been forced to limit myself time and time again and all the while my gear stops being supported by Roland or Korg. The original Machinedrum came out in  or . They STILL support it over at elektron.  years later. Fuck I cant even buy pads for my ESX I gotta get in there with cannibalized parts a soldering gun and a midi hookup. Honestly I WISH Id dropped real cash from the start instead of cheaping out on mediocre samplers for so many years. Id be so much better right now if Id gone all in from the start.If Id started with an Octa I wouldnt need any of the shit I have right now save for a mixer and a turntable. And My gear fills up a table ten feet long. Id be able to perform my entire catalog as a continuous mix with a machine that fits in my backpack.If you decide this path is not for you?

The way you built upon the sample was solid too the bass could be a bit more natural and have less of a synthesizer edge but thats about it.

2583260,0,t1_cmvgjix,Im not a pro with mixing but it kinda sound distorted and quiet. Make sure its not peaking above the dB meters that reduces the distortion.When recording make sure all the vocals are pretty much on the same volume levelsmeaning the visual waveform.Since you have quite much things on lower frequencies such as the bass you might wanna cut the lower frequencies on vocals and maybe boost some mid highish freqs to make it vocals sound clearer. If your bass kick and vocals are playing in the same freqrange it causes muddled sound and distortion.Make sure you dont have too much gain with your microphone. HERES an example with too much gain and almost the right amount.I dont know what software you are using but thats FL Studios basic sound recordingediting tool and i think you get the point anyway. If you have the gain set up too highrecording gear mics preamps external audio interfaces etc. youre getting the results shown on the left side. The right side shows maybe slightly quiet volume for the recorded audio so you should aim somewhere between those. Try panning some of the elements to either left or right SLIGHTLY but keep the drum elements and vocals pretty much in the center. This gives you more depth to your track and the vocals have more room to breathe in the middle.Hope this helps even a little. And sorry for any grammatical errors English isnt my native language but you probably get the point. ,makinghiphop,cmvrps3,1,t5_2sqw4

You need to remember that the primary purpose of any highquality recording is to recreate the reality of the moment in the most authentic and believable way possible. The simple fact is that the better the mic the more authentic and accurate the audio recording will be. In fact if quality was not a concern wed all still be using crystal or carbon microphones!gtHeres the difference between dynamic and condenser microphones  and it has absolutely nothing to do with a specially treated room. To discuss this in detail would take a lot of space so well cover only the basics.gtDynamic microphones use a moving coil design  sort of like a loudspeaker in reverse.The mics diaphragm is attached to a coil of copper wire that surrounds a permanent magnet. Sound waves striking the diaphragm move the diaphragm creating a change in the magnetic field which in turn creates a current flow in the mic cable that is proportional to the movement of the diaphragm. Analog sound waves are converted to electrical energy. Although some dynamic mics are very very good the mere facts that the diaphragm must physically move and that there is resistance due to the permanent magnetic field mean that most dynamic microphones have a limitation when it comes to reproducing high frequencies. The comparatively slower response time of the dynamic mic also has the effect of masking or minimizing some sounds that will be picked up by a condenser mic.gtCondenser microphones use an electrically charged stationary plate and a moving plate to replace the moving coil diaphragm of the dynamic mic.The use of two plates to store a charge is the design of a capacitor which is also known as a condenser. Thus the name condenser microphone. The two plates in a condenser mic are very thin and very close together. Instead of a permanent magnet a condenser mic requires a phantom or external power supply to provide an initial voltage across the two plates. When sound waves strike the movable plate the voltage changes thus converting analog sound waves to electrical energy. Because there is no resistance from a magnetic field a condenser mic can respond extremely fast. This is why condenser mics seem to pick up everything. They actually do because the condenser mic can hear a lot more than a dynamic mic. The faster response allows a condenser mic to reproduce a much more realistic and uncolored sound especially in the higher frequencies.gtSo why are high frequencies important? Because the nuance and subtlety of communication lives in the harmonics of speech and music. And the harmonics are in the higher frequencies. The average human voice is in the frequency range of around  Hz to just over  Hz. But the human ear can hear a frequency range of roughly  Hz to  Hz. All the details of communication reside in those frequencies above  Hz.gtThere are many designs for both dynamic and condenser microphones  and both types have their advantages and disadvantages. However when it comes to recording the human voice the more accurate the recording can be  the better.gtNoise reduction falls in the category of audio signal processing. ALL audio processing is designed and intended to either create an effect or attempt to correct for adeficiencyin an audio recording. Thinking that noise reduction will change a poor recording to one that is professionally acceptable is simply the result of a serious lack of education.gtMost producers today want recordings that are pristine and clean of the highest possible quality and without any audio processing or very minimal processing. This is why condenser microphones are the preferred mic for voiceover and why it is so important for voice actors singers and other performers to have at least a basic understanding of the recording process how their equipment works and the importance of recording in asacoustically perfect an environmentas possible.Source,makinghiphop,cn0ygxu,2,t5_2sqw4

Theres plenty of artists that make it on their own through hard work persistence focus and a genuine passion for their craft. Look at guys like Danny Brown who didnt start making waves until he was in his s. Dont let other peoples decisions affect the path you want to take youll regret it when you look back years from now. Not everybody is going to become a huge star in music and that has to be accepted too youve got to make the music for yourself and for your own enjoyment as much as anyone elses. I hope the heroin thing isnt a problem you personally are facing its a struggle and I know people who have dealt with it and it will eventually take over the users life one way or another. It definitely wont help to use if youre serious about getting any sort of a music career together. But you hit the nail on the head.

You really have no idea what your bass is going to sound like unless youre listening on larger speakersmonitors or if you have a subwoofer. In both applications placement is key. I listened to this track and have to say I really dont like many aspects of the mastering and overall arrangement of the beat and sample itself.

To be picky this is also a bit of personal preference using an equalizer on the guitar? loop that plays through most of the track and turning down alot the lows and the ultra highs would give a more natural less synthesized feel to the instrument. If you use fl studio a good example of the type of eq setting im referring to would be the radio preset on the parametric eq . Also a bit of reverb on that instrument would also help a bit. Overall though very well written. ,makinghiphop,cnj3rwh,1,t5_2sqw4

2923565,0,t1_co0df3w,first beat has a very cool minimal vibe.  reminds me of ima read by zebra katz.  only thing i am worried about is you lack of high end.  you have a lot of low freq and midlow freq with that bass  kick  repeating synth but not really any defining high end besides high hats.  that being said a rappers voice could fill that mid  high end freq range but idk if it would be enough.  perhaps some higher octave synths could do the trick.   great work though,makinghiphop,co0f2ph,1,t5_2sqw4

Would you consider this trap And the same thing can be said about boom bap. The same swing pattern. The few drum elements usually just a kick snare and a hat and the same type of bass.Its a great time for hiphop because people are drawing influences from everywhere and still making modern sounding music.

3096049,0,t1_coio5nh,Personally I prefer to make an  sub with a synth and have a bit more freedom with the tweaking. I use logic so I did mine in the ES but I would bet that whatever synth you prefer either has a sub bass preset or you could find a tutorial on how to make one.From there I most commonly tweak the release to either make it like a hit once and fade out sound or press and hold then cut off sharply sound. I also tweak the distortion or add some noise to it to give it that aggressive sound.  ,makinghiphop,coiwkpw,1,t5_2sqw4

You want to be able to build on ideas as quickly as possible. To that end the length of the sample doesnt help me much at all...organizing by the type of sound eg piano bell etc lets you find the type of sound you want a lot easier.

3294888,0,t1_cp3u0k0,In my experience Trip Hop is way way more about the samples and the sound is not something you can get from a sound font or a preset. Im sorry I know thats not much help but it doesnt mean you cant sample creatively use old sounds in new ways take pieces out of speeches or chants you find online. You can even just loop your own manipulation of anything even just using a keyboard with pieces of some preset.I really think its key that you repurpose something somewhere along the way.Other than that? Maybe... think about a potential intersection between trance and hip hop instrumentals. What would that sound like? Then you start getting into stuff like the debut album of Unkle and maybe you wonder if its all just a culture based on the projections of how others before them have been affected by the soul of HipHop how Trip Hop itself how its this chichi white third hand Hip Hop like music How its just sanitized future music readied for white mass consumption with all the sharp edges taken away and kick scratches on the downbeat.Then everyone calls you crazy and starts making fun of you.Honestly. though  bullshit aside?

3487196,0,t1_cpprjkk,and to show im not that self involved uJoeltheBard tells you how to ask questions and not beg for permissionQuestions are key and this sub is an amazing resource in that we get to ask even the ones were embarrassed to ask irl and to ask them to hiphop artists who tread same path us but have different perspectives and maybe the missing pieces to fill the gaps in our knowledge.  The vast majority of questions are great but there is one type of question that is bad. Asking permission. Its one thing to ask about methodology technique or to request feedback. Its quite another to ask if its okay to do something. Sure etiquette exists and its important to know how the rap game works but dont box your self in. Dont squander your hiphop because of a perceived limitation or curtail your style because what you want to do simply isnt done. Mostly dont ask if you or any type of art has merit value or potential. Only you can decide that.  Can you rap even though English isnt your first language?  Yes.  Obviously you should aim to be clearly understood.  Does unfocused punchline rap have any merit?  Yes.  Would it be even better if its more focused?  That depends on your listeners taste and mood. Of course there are such things as conventions literary devices and blah blah blah. Theyre all rules that are meant to be broken. Art is subjective. What matters is how you feel about your work.  Is it okay to rerecord your EP?  Yes.  Yes to almost anything. If the answer is no itll be obvious.  Im white. Should I use the Nword?  Of course not. And as obvious as that is it comes from the same rational mind that knows when the answer is yes.  Yes you may rap if youre a nerd. You have permission to spit in Portugese or Swedish too. You can make a beat tape sampling nothing but country or Hans Zimmer or Showtunes if thats what you want to do. Even if youre fat ugly white andor suburban you have the right to make any type of music you like. Even if you flat out make shitty music you have that right.  Dont doubt yourself or feel out of place. The rap game can be a dogmatic place. If nobody likes you fuck em. Dont worry about shit that doesnt matter. I did for way too long and please let me be a time saver its a fucking idiotic use of brain waves. I squandered too many years of my life not rapping because I thought that being a white Jewish guy from the suburban Midwest disqualified me. Luckily I found myself and my confidence. Find yourself if you havent. Its a process but its doable. For everything there is a process a path. And if you want to make music theres a path for it. If you want to design motherfucking birdhouses follow that path. And dont ask anybody whether its a sin to use green popsicle sticks. There are paths to Mastery everywhere you build your custom path as you travel it. Youre here so you want to make hiphop. Thats dope. But what if you suck? No biggie. Even if you cant keep a rhythm you will be able to after enough practice. Or youll decide you dont want it that badly. Thats okay too.  Dont be ashamed of your taste either. Youre you. Guess what? I fucking love listening to Enya. I even get down to artists who you could find at Lilith Fair. Sara Barelles WHAT! Bagpipes are fucking awesome and Adam Lambert KILLED it on American Idle and I was suprised to learned that I shazamed a Katy Perry song today. Im proIsrael. I play magic cards. I cant fucking wait for Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs  because the first one was one of my all time favorites. More often than not when I jerk off I just use my imagination. Make fun of me if you like. I dont care. I wont even fuck your girl because Im not mad.  Learn from Pac. Only God can judge you. If youre an atheist guess what! You dont even need to worry about that. Not giving a fuck is easier said than done of course but its necessary to free yourself of asking permission to be any certain way or to make any particular piece of art. Especially if youre gonna be an Emcee you need to own your actions and you cant own your actions if youre second guessing yourself.  If you do something that it isnt okay to do call it Avant Gaurd. Im rapping with no rhythm to ask the question... what is rap? Now youre like Andy Warhol. Bam.  Yes this is a skill. Yes its possible to flat out suck. Everybody does at first. But thats just a stage and youll progress nomatter what. Even a severe lack of natural aptitude can be overcome with work ethic. Jimi Hendrix wasnt born playing the guitar. And Tony Melendez certainly wasnt born playing the guitar with his feet.  And Im not condemning anyone for asking for opinions or wanting to know industry conventionsadvice.Youre an innovator. You dont need anybodys validation. You have the right to be an artist. Buy me a beer when you realize this. Youll know you realized it because youre getting laid more.  ,makinghiphop,cpprkkd,5,t5_2sqw4

I know a couple that just performed their mixtape at a friends venue. There are also a couple that had a lot of friends that they just shared their mixtape with and the hype spread by word of mouth. Theres also the social mediafan interaction gurus that have a lot of following online and they just know how to interact with their fans. Post Malone whos from where Im from and Flamez Fuego come to mind. Really the process is about finding your niche and what your good at just like with creating a distinctive rapping style. Read up on some stuff on marketing in your free time and treat your mixtape like a product. Nobody wants a product that the seller doesnt believe in. This mixtape probably wont be your best work but try to make it as good as possible with or without the help of others. Travi Scott Kanye Drake Father etc. etc. all sounded way different when they were first starting out until now. What they all have in common is that they had a vision of where they wanted to take their music. Have a vision and be able to articulate it to people that want to help you out. This is a lot and it probably doesnt help much but theres no surefire scientific way to guarantee your mixtape drop will be what you want it to be.

3581847,0,t1_cq0jjim,That first part is more clear. Ill have to check that website outI have known musicians and producers who know music theory and those who dont and in my experience it makes a difference!I used to go to this local ableton group learntogether thing. The guy who headed it had this method of copying and pasting chords that blew my mind with its unnecessary complexity and yielded a bunch of lousy results before anything good happened. If he had just taken a couple piano lessons hed have had a better idea of why some chords worked together and others didnt and would have been better equipped to bring his vision to life. Granted hip hop doesnt necessarily rely on tonality and is kind of the exception in that way but it goes deeper than just chords.Ive known many musicians that just dove in and never learned why something sucks or how to fix it. I guess Im saying that its as important to learn what not to do as it is to learn how to do the good things. the unknown unknowns ,makinghiphop,cq0k50z,3,t5_2sqw4

3628350,0,t3_31wxr9,Honestly you gotta go through the range to find the right zone. My suggestion is to put them on a range of instrumentals from popular artists with different styles and see which one they end up sounding the best in and then MOLD beats to that sound. For instance you might have an artist that sounds like ass on a boom bap beat but then they might kill it with a Mike Will Made It type of trap beat. You might have an artist who shines with a production of deep basses and airy vocals but cant carry a upbeat pop beat for shit. Its just all about going through the pain of several styles and finding the one that clicks really. ,makinghiphop,cq5uyfn,1,t5_2sqw4

3924077,0,t1_cr3ar7i,The intro was incredible I almost wish the entire track was like that and you just added elements on top of that beginning part. The chops were slightly iffy because they werent connected so you can hear when each chop starts which is not particularly appealing. Also the drum pattern you used was rather boring. I would try to switch it up. In my opinion you should have slowed the drums down and added some very  slight reverb to them to create a booming drum sound that would match the atmosphere of the sample.

You can find the peak frequency in any sound Mostly found in drums and fastattack instruments with a spectrum analyser or just an EQ with one built in.

Then in the maschine vst just set each groups audio out to the tracks in ableton. Then record the audio and add in other sounds or effects with Abletons features.

I think it was a success people got crazy riled up and we really brought the heat and energy. Its a challenge to be flexible while also maintaining your originality but its totally possible. Find your own way.I like some of the suggestions here too. Heres another one find a song that you KNOW will be played somewhere at this festival before your set.

4537021,0,t1_ct1w5mo,Yo thanks for listening! Im pretty sure Tuamie and Dibiase both produce on the Roland SPSP and other hardware. Those samplers have a builtin vinyl simulator effect that really saturates the sound and gives it the sidechain effect when the drums kick in. Keep experimenting with parallel compression on the MPC Im sure you will get to a sound that works for ya. Also do you have JJOS installed on your MPC? Its a custom firmware that makes the MPC super powerful by changing up the workflow and adding a bunch of features. You have to buy it but its totally worth it. I would recommend starting with JJOS  .I definitely recommend getting a hardware synth.  Microkorgs are around  and are a great way to learn subtractive synthesis. They have a couple onboard fx that work okay and you can always play synths through your MPC and use the internal effectscompression to beef up the sound. I personally use the SP for fx and processing my beats while I record it has a really warm sound and works great in a live situation.,makinghiphop,ct2itvd,1,t5_2sqw4

A lot of times Id find that the beat I was recording over was too well mixed for my vocals to sit naturally no matter how hard I tried. You might want to try dirtying up your mix on the track so the vocals sit nicer.

From there you can of course pay attention to rhymes schemes flow cadences and the sort.

I cant explain this well without giving printscreens or anything but a two bar three note arpeggio would look something like this in FL Most DAWs automate this as do many VSTs but having learned how to do music from transcribing NES songs into MIDI files I learned that doing the notes yourself give you the most control over sound.,makinghiphop,ctnfiwe,2,t5_2sqw4

Each word on its own line. So its on top a in between and Bash on the bottom. It would be cool with each letter a different color. Like those colorful magnetic alphabet letters you always saw on the fridge. With the parental advisory warning in the bottom corner to top it off.

When a graff artist paints a freight he lets it go gives it away and it travels the country spreading his gospel and style.Of course a graf artists name is an inherent part of that piece so it is tagged in a sense. But I strongly feel that you should only release previews and let go of your songs once theyre out there. When you do that the songs if good take on a life all their own that you have no control over. They might travel the globe be heard by tens of thousands. If your track is good the people who matter will track you down  believe me on that.,makinghiphop,cu4e21r,2,t5_2sqw4

The best thing you can do to get out of your head is exercise! You dont have to go to the gym theres  exercise that I want you to do everyday for just  minute a day I do it and it helped me ALOT during my own problems.  lt skip to  in that video and do what hes showing. It looks dumb af but the dumber you look doing it the more youre letting go. This exercise is perfect for someone like you that just needs to get out of there head when you do the exercise just let yourself go completely. Do that everyday or you can just dance to some music its the same thing. Just  minute a day let yourself go completely youll feel better. lmk if u need anything.p.s. in ur free time go thru that guys videos theres life changing shit in there check out his other channel called Elliot Hulse aswell.,makinghiphop,cuae413,1,t5_2sqw4

I think you have a lot of good sound in your voice I would just always make sure to work with it and not against it. With more practice and work this track could be pretty nice. The highlow voice thing mightve worked if you just did it once but it sounds a bit weird the amount of times you did it. Outro gets too loud.

5259740,0,t3_3n00nq,I agree with a lot of answers here. I think everyone feels like they hit a brick wall at times. At times I feel like Ive hit a wall and then I surprise myself by making something dope and Im like oh shit but can I do it again? But I think the point is to not worry about hitting brick walls. Every art has its walls  writers block etc. and every artist has their fears about not improving further but honestly I think if you are passionate enough and enjoy making music you will keep surprising yourself and you start to view your previous walls as just obstacles or artists block. I think the  tip I have for you after you learn to use your software and gear is to look up some of your favorite beats find their samples if you can WhoSampled is a great source and recreate them to the T. You will learn how to make better music by figuring out how the producer makes those snares roll etc. Its never easy but I dont think any art is. What helps you is practice practice practice. If you decided to continue make it  a habit. Down time? Make a beat. Just make something every day and I promise youll get better,makinghiphop,cvjznip,1,t5_2sqw4

I usually fix this in the editing stage if Im serious with the verse.I honestly dont care if people think I suck because I lack some wordplay do too little metaphors dont have enough multis etc. One person could take a look at my words and see crap while another could look and see some pretty clever lines usually not the case for joke verses.

It takes me a few minutes to write those first couple lines but once they come out its usually smooth sailing from there. Maybe before you sit down to write do the same thing or something like it.

If you wanna get real slick with it you can record a third in the center lane with a very low volume to sort of blend it all together nicely. The key to all this of course is having the ability to deliver the exact same take multiple times. Sometimes you just have to rerecord a million times.  ,makinghiphop,cwbqqz1,7,t5_2sqw4

Its generally a safe bet to stick to the key of your song  but I mean artists like the Beatles and many others do let changes all the time and I mean with how popular beat switches are these days a producer could definitely make it work.

Six months is a really short time to be a musician and one week is an incredibly short time to gain any exposure unless you have someone big putting you on.Its unrealistic to the point of delusion to think that after just one week a freely streamed selfrelease would earn you much money or success in this very oversaturated field.

5609262,0,t1_cwsb98b,It affects the high end really. You know when a sample is converted to numbers the computer takes a slice of sound and stores it in binary. The higher the bitrate the more slices per second are taken and encoded. At a lower encoding rate the computer takes bigger slices of sound more like chunks when you get to  and . Its like working with square pixels. If youve ever looked at a wave form then youve probably seen the spiking of a snare hit. Those sharp peaks get kind of flattened out a bit when you go to  bit or lower so the higher pitched sounds tend to get the nuance blunted out of them but the bass kind of stays similar. You could also use this in combination with an LPF but downrating your bits will make everything sound sort of low and crunchy which may very well be a great thing for your song.,makinghiphop,cwsdt98,2,t5_2sqw4

5626904,0,t3_3s6buy,Im in the ableton camp but I have to imagine its a similar process in FL. Take a bunch of  bar chops they can be however long you want but lets keep it to  bar for simplicitys sake figure out the sequence that you want them in and then tap out the bpm. Once you have the bpm set accordingly in FL youll want to take each of those chops and time stretch them so they match up to being exactly  bar in the DAW itself they will likely be a little bit shorter or a little bit longer but with the small amount of time stretching it shouldnt get too distorted. You should be able to loop these chops and sequence instruments over top and have it all be in time after this.The time stretching is important because even though when youre listening to the sample and counting out the beats it will sound in time but since its real humans playing instruments its very doubtful that theyre  on beat the whole time. Thats why it will sound wonky if you try to loop a sequence of these chops especially if theyre taken from different parts of the song. Theyll be very close to the same bpm but one will be a little longer than the others one will be a little shorter etc etc.Hope this helps.,makinghiphop,cwukkj5,1,t5_2sqw4

I learned that you need to project your voice but rhyme slowly and with more melody. This takes wayyyyy more vocal control and confidence than normal cases. You need to be confident with how you sound even if you dont like your voice and be able to rap in a chill way without error. I usually practice my verse for an hour or longer to work out any kinks because even the smallest things will be noticed. Vocal warmups are a must for me Ill even practice spitting aloud for an hour or so stop and drink water for half an hour then repeat to get my voice the way I want it.So what you need isExperienceConfidencePracticeSmooth FlowYou need lots and lots of all that to accomplish a lazy flow if you spit for a good  years youll find this isnt as hard to do as it once was.,makinghiphop,cwvqb15,2,t5_2sqw4

If someone were to rap over it the listener might be distracted. Take any song on Illmatic by nas for example or Slim shady lp by em. Dre specifically said he wanted to tune down the beat and make something really simple so the focus could be on eminem.just a personal thought though. ive barely tried to make beats but if thats your first i think its good. its just that you made a tank for a car race you know what i mean?,makinghiphop,cx5aaw9,1,t5_2sqw4

5865611,0,t3_3vkcg5,While youre starting out try every different approach you can think of. Everyone makes music differently so its super important to find the best workflow for yourself. The only way you can do that is to have an open mind and constantly try different things.Ive tried many different ways but generally I start with the sample. Ill go through and listen for parts I like and Ill copy them to a scratch track. Sometimes Ill go in as soon as I find something I like but often Ill go through the whole trackalbum and then review my clips. Then add drums then bass then details.As far as advantages to the order in which you do the drums versus the samples I think it more just determines the direction you go in. If you start with the sample the drums will go in a direction that vibes with the sample groove. Whereas if you start with the drums you are kinda starting with the groove already and thats the direction the sample will have to go.Ive always had the approach of trying to be open to let the music take me where is wants to and let me take it where it wants to be. If that makes any sense at all.,makinghiphop,cxoigl0,3,t5_2sqw4

The instrumental itself I think is well mixed and quality. My only qualm was the first rapped first. A couple touchy performance spots limelight? and end lines were doubled without real justification. I definitely think you have a good voice but I would touch up the performance and tighten up the actual lyric content. The second verse was very quality. ,makinghiphop,cyaof58,2,t5_2sqw4

So with that said Im going to tear into it but I really want to emphasize how dope this track could be. Try out some different sounds for your kick hi hats and particularly the snare. I dont like the snare you used but I like the drum pattern. I even think you could keep the snare but just put something else on top of it for the first hit. Try throwing some effects on your instruments to give them a more unique sound and also to fill out the space. Dont be afraid to just start turning nobs even if you dont know what theyre doing. Youll find out eventually if it really matters. Fuck around with  AND  band EQs and Limiters to boost the sound that may not be best practice its just what I do. Im still learning though. ChSepha is right about the bass too it needs to be more full and the kick needs to come up a bitbe layered. Lastly the intro could honestly start at  and try a different hi hat pattern for it something that builds to the beat drop.Really nice start though you better not give up on it.,makinghiphop,cygoe52,1,t5_2sqw4

6107002,0,t3_3z6yug,I search soundcloud for rappers I like and send them beats some respond some dont. So far Ive been able to get some really cool features and as im improving and getting more recognition Im unlocking replies from better and more active rappers who have good work ethic and promote themselves well.Hope it goes as well as it did last year. I put in a lot of grind and actually do different styles both boombap trap and others so Ill always have different beats for different rappers plus from what Ive been told my style is unique so it can also be a mix of whatever and people seem to respond well to that too.Always thrive for greatness. Sure there are people who made it by being just good enough or alright but theres a lot of variables to that. Theres a huge chance you can become the next production god and no one will ever pay attention to you until youve been dead for a hundred years.I dont really believe in spamming twitter or instagram. Ill upload my stuff to youtube and a teaser to instagram but I think if you do good work and actually seek out people that are compatible with you and put in the work itll speak bigger volumes for you.There occasionally will be opportunities to send beats to bigger rappers which is worth a try but dont base anything on that they get like a thousand beats a day and I imagine they abandon the idea of picking anything after the first few hundreds of type beats and just get some well known producer from their phone contacts.,makinghiphop,cyjsy0q,6,t5_2sqw4

6310893,0,t1_cz6ybl2,Yes it is perceived as louder and wider in the mix. I use Logic and the sample delay looks like this You just set your parameters usually keeping either left or right . Then it will delay that one side depending on where your pan is. So if its like  left itll delay  right. If its centered itll delay centered. At least thats what the Logic one does. ,makinghiphop,cz6z7un,2,t5_2sqw4

6330198,0,t3_42c032,Theres actually a lot of that in even some of the more mainstream beats. Usually it takes a decent rapper to keep the rhythm going rather than having a snare on the  and  every time. Also they can record with the metronome going or adding a temporary snare just for recording and then removing it.It seems like a lot of the really minimalistic beats that dont have a lot of harder hitting rhythmic drums rely on the hi hats. The hats act as a bit of a metronome a lot of times.Theres also going outside of the  tempo which I cant really give any advice on lol,makinghiphop,cz969ty,7,t5_2sqw4
6330277,0,t3_42aooc,I guess the best advice is practice everything. Practice writing practice spitting and maybe practice producing.

6433268,0,t1_czkpdrv,Doobie ashtray is a cool song to sample. Snare seems to hit a bit late. I do actually like drums to not be right on the grid but this is throwing me off a lot. Lyrics are pretty good. You have good intonation and the flow is all good. Nice smooth vibes. The recording is not very good unfortunately. What microphone did you use? It sounds super lo fi. Like its been recorded on a laptop mic. Also its a bit too loud in the mix which I dont usually say. Ive been giving the opposite advice to a lot of people today but this is just too present. If you record this well and the song is well mixed this could be on par with a lot of professional underground artists. Good luck man You got talent.

6564765,0,t1_czxw9m3,holy shit yes. Its super important and useful for sound asset creation. If you want to use any outboard audio hardware youre going to need a decent interface.

I listened to your track and I dont think your low end is too muddy. The only thing that pops out to me is that the snare is kind of quiet compared to how deep the kick hits. Also think that this beat has the potential for incredible build up to a big drop with some horrorstyle strings  orchestral hits but I think thats just my style bleeding into it haha.

Be ready to look up everything. You know how to use your software so now its time to find out what everyone of those settings that you skip overor never paid attention to do.

6765449,0,t1_d0j3sxm,st verse  is kind of repetitive in terms of melody and flow doesnt really distinguish itself from what i guess would be considered the chorus . Overall kind of derivative like poor mans Post Malone. I like that direction though and the chorus is close to good imho  I just think its not there yet.At some point you say I ball at the mall. You can do better man.nd verse or whatever you would call the switch of voice at  comes in but doesnt really feel like enough of a change. Like Im bored at that point and now the same vibe continues.The bridge thing that starts at  is a good idea you need something like that but to me its not that interesting. Not enough of a changebuildup or anything.Ok thats all I got. Hope that helps.,makinghiphop,d0j560m,1,t5_2sqw4

More literary devices in that one piece then there is in your entire SoundCloud.

6824601,0,t1_d0ptbnc,Great sample. Some timing issues with the way youre chopping it up though. Youre looping it back too early around . Also the tempo isnt right with your drums so you might need to adjust the tempo of the sample.

6829373,0,t1_d0qemu1,Biggest thing for me and it was noted on your page by someone else is the vocals kind of get lost behind the music which makes it tough to judge the quality of the vocals. I like the heavy bass synth though and the production as a whole  including the small breakdowns and drum stops  are on point.

6830623,0,t1_d0qfpjp,Nailed the vibe. Liking the detuning sample. I do feel like you said it is a little empty. Maybe mess around with some background synths with a minimal pattern just to keep it fresh or try a a breakdown with the drums or something. I do think if a rapper was on it though the emptiness wouldnt be an issue.,makinghiphop,d0qjvbc,1,t5_2sqw4
6831484,0,t3_499hal,Im not certain on internet radio broadcasting details so Ill go off the little knowledge I have of OTAlive broadcasting.      gt  How many channels does the mixer need?      Not sure on internet broadcasting but OTA we used  channel mixers at the least. Even if we knew we were only going to use  we always used . Because we are crazy I guess. But also we had a lot of shit to plug in multiple mics streams etc.      gt Do I need one or more computers?      You can do one computer with multiple soundcards doing different streams from my understanding but one for the radio software and a laptop or tabletphone thing for cruising the web for content to use in the podcast or whatever reason. We used a laptop to look up current news to talk about. Im not certain with internet radio if you need the computer and software running  like OTA stations so check on that. Get a UPS and backup drives either way.    gt What software do I need?      Radio Automation Software. Enco radiodj direttore tunetracker jazler sam broadcasting etc. Theres a bunch out there some free some very not free. Do some research and find out which one works best for you. Many have trial periods.  read below.       gtIm gonna get the airtime.pro Premium plan but what else do I need?        This actually comes with the software you need that I stated earlier so no need disregard my statement. And thats all you need actually. Youre not OTA so you wont need to worry about how many watts your transmitter needs or the meters and meters of coax. Airtime takes care of everything else that you would need in broadcasting as far as my skimming of it really quick goes.          gtWhat headphones to get?      Closed back over the ear referencemonitor headphones. They can be Sony Audio Technica Beats really does not matter on brand as long as they are closed back and over the ear so sound doesnt spill out into the mic. Plus youre going to be getting several headphones and a headphone splitteramp. One pair for each mic and a couple extra just in case. Our rule was always two headphones per micchannel. But you can get by with just the minimum.     gt Should I get USB mics or XLR mics?      XLR XLR XLR. I can not enforce this enough. No offense to USB they are great I use them and love them but XLR all day in a broadcast environment hands down. This is because I will never have to worry about any hums or ground loop noise of any kind from those connections. Also get a swivel desk mount boom style mic stand. The kind that clips or bolts on to the desktable. Dont get standing style like a stage performer uses or desk standing youll thank me later. And for dog sakes use a shock mount you psychopath. Get windscreens or pop filters as well depending on if you are using dynamic or condenser mic. I didnt always need windscreens or pop filters a lot of times we left the mics bare but they are nice to have if you needwant them. Personally I prefer pop filter over windscreen in a broadcast setting regardless of the mic type.    gtGonna get  or  mics I think. Do I need monitors?      The amount of mics doesnt dictate a need for monitors. I would still have some for broadcast monitoring regardless.         gt Do I need audio interface?      Yeah but thatll be on your mixer if you plan right. Get a bus mixer that includes the USB audio interface and youre good to go. An example would be the Alto Live  that I put into a club recently.         One of the audio engineering subs may have some gear heads that are in the business or have better knowledge than I you could also check them out.

6907619,0,t3_4ad33v,Very good topic and question. Looking forward to some more replies. Have you gotten into layering sounds? Personally im still in the stage where i am going through a huge library of drums to find that right kick or snare. I might just start layering my drum samples here pretty soon. I always feel hesitant about layering because from what i understand the more sounds you add to a track the more shit starts peaking and headroom is lost. I have theories to counter this roadblock though. I guess try layering sounds from your drum kit with obscure sounds you may have in your library. You might just come up with some unique sounding instruments. I cant wait to try this myself.,makinghiphop,d0zaqm2,2,t5_2sqw4

6980099,0,t1_d17irp2,I totally agree with uJWiLLii. He put some really good feedback in there for you.

6990140,0,t3_4bf4w4,The way i see it you can either learn from producing work like that or take your time and master what you already knoware learning.Producing  beats a day is like how a lot of ATL artists these days are putting out mixtapes. Its a lot of music but the mixtapes usually only have  or  songs that are actually memorableSay you made  beats a week taking Sunday off. Thats  beats a day. Out of all those beats probably only  are good skeletons that have potential. The rest are just beats that dont really hold anything special.Unless you are hitting a run like Future where you can go consecutive weeks of just fire beats it seems counter intuitive to me. Like right now Young Thug has put out so much stuff that its all starting to sound like meh. The same thing could happen to your beats. Unless youre doing a bunch of acid youre not really giving yourself enough time to be innovative thus you just keep making the same thingUnless you really can come up with idea after idea.Knxwledge used to do the same thing dropping hella tapes. His style is abstract af but rigid at the same time. Flooding works for him cause no one else does what he does that good.Basically look at Future Young Thug and other ATL artists. They drop stuff like crazy but it ends up just being riding music or background music.Then look at Schoolboy Q Kendrick Drake and other artists that dont drop for long intervals theyre work usually sounds different and like they added something to their work.TLDR Basically I think producers and beat makers should always be looking to be innovative. Just flooding out your works doesnt give you much time to be creative and you are almost forcing yourself to stay relevant. Of course when you get to a certain point where you understand your workflow you might be able to make  or so full fire beats a week as opposed to  beat skeletons a week with only a few that even have potential.,makinghiphop,d18oa9s,2,t5_2sqw4

7028635,0,t3_4bw5zh,Ive rereleased two older tracks yesterday. After a while I went back to them made a few improvements and realized theyre dope in their own way.One is a sort of lofi trap beat with a classical sample chopped to shit and drums with slight breakcore influences.The other beat is more new school hiphop influenced by late s early s adult contemporary. It has that young Bruce Willis staring at the neon reflecting off the sea after getting his detective badge suspended feel to it. Theres some crazy snare play in there too and really comforting bassy atmosphere.,makinghiphop,d1d1s6a,1,t5_2sqw4

I look up to ugly mane alot too production wise so i definitely can see what youre aiming for. I think the biggest thing with his style of shit is that he is incredible at sampling so practicing sampling trying to flip samples different types of ways and choosing the right samples are all essential to his style. Looking at other dudes similar to him and looking at the type of shit they sample and how they do it ive found is helpful. Keep on practicing and itll start to click.,makinghiphop,d1dx1ni,1,t5_2sqw4

Ive only been doing this for about two months and its cool when people like you are so helpful and nice. I listened to your beat its really good. The mixing is really crisp. I love all the subtle drums and the slight variations in the main synth chime? I dont know what it is specifically but it flows great. Especially when the fast snares ride the beat.

My monitors and headphones always make me think that the bass is coming through a lot louder than it actually does on most other speakers. I tried a bunch of different pads and they all just made it sound too busy. Thats actually how I got that last little Zeldasounding kind of melody that you mentioned. I was trying to find a pad to fill things in a little more and ended up with that sound.

Its easy to vibe too and is just really easy on the ears overall. On first listen I really appreciate the lyrics and the songwriting as whole. Writing to a beat has always been really hard for me as I can never seem to write words that fit the emotion and energy of my beats but youve got a good ear for what would sound the best over your beats. The mixing on the vocals sounds kinda off to me but my ear isnt trained enough to tell you exactly why. Perhaps too much reverb? Im not really sure. Your voice needs a little work too but thats something youll fix through consistently recording and releasing material. But yeah man awesome track great job. ,makinghiphop,d1oiget,1,t5_2sqw4

I read something from London on da track. He gave away beats until he signed his deal. For him getting his name out there with sick beats was more important than the quality of the vocalist.

7384639,0,t1_d2hkmb5,just listened to the one titled better mix. to be  honest i wasnt really feeling this melody it felt a little overwhelming almost like obnoxious by the end. those repeated chords just never really caught on for me. ive heard your stuff on here before and i really fuck with it but just not a fan of this one. in terms of the mix things were sounding somewhat muddy at times on my monitors especially when everythings in the track at once. maybe try and eq the bass and kicks to share some of the lowerend a bit better or maybe even sidechain them? hope I dont sound super harsh i just know you can make fire beats and i just personally dont feel like this is one of them. if you get a chance to peep mine that would be super appreciated feel free to rip me apart haha,makinghiphop,d2hl08f,2,t5_2sqw4

7538856,0,t1_d2z455e,I didnt really set a definition. I did say that I used the term trap loosely and that I consider anything with banging s to be trap. In my opinion the track you linked is not trap. To me those s arent banging. But maybe I typed too hastily. My sound engineering terminology is not the best as I dont make beats. I know melody has a lot to do with what is considered trap. Here are two tracks that I consider to be trap which have bangin s and contain progression.,makinghiphop,d2z4qi1,3,t5_2sqw4

7570440,0,t3_4i389f,I sample on FL Studio. I struggled to find my setup but now positive or not I cant change it. I use Edison to record a long sample then I drag the interesting part in Slicex. If you had not see it try it. It is so comfortable to work with samples with it. You can change samples lenght number start and endpoint and also normalize fades etc.To make it more natural I bought a pair of years ago a Korg NanoPad. I honestly do not need any other tool or maybe it can be useful but I have to bend my mind to put it in my workflow. My advice is to try Slicex. Maschine is cool but then you have sort of another daw that behaves differently... So buy it only if youre supersure that you need it. I bought the nanopad after  years i bought an oxygen keyboard. ,makinghiphop,d32q0af,1,t5_2sqw4

7585298,0,t1_d34d856,admittedly Im not listening on monitors so i cant give a ton of advice on the low end. but those portamento slides sound better when the samplesynth has a saturator on it to bring out the upper harmonics which it sounds like there is some either from you or the sample you used. when i make my s i saturate them and then the trick is to eq again after that to get rid of unpleasant frequencies the saturator makes sometimes. usually i lowpass at around hz after i saturate and then boost or cut to your preference. usually cut. hope this makes sensehelps!,makinghiphop,d34etgb,1,t5_2sqw4

But at the end of the day music is music. And if the music is not pleasant to listen to  I will not enjoy your music as a listener no Matter How crafty your personas are. I use Logic to record and mix but I heard reaper works well as well. You simply need something that has an EQ Compressor Reverb and Delay. ,makinghiphop,d3bgjs2,1,t5_2sqw4

But after listening to it once before I knew it was coming and it seemed a lot smoother. But that cut at  is pretty smooth even on the first listen.

Regardless yeah youre right I did finish the track up quite fast so the mixing isnt the best. As for your track for the intro it sounds like your vocals are a bit too low compared to the instrumental. Overall throughout the whole track you could have turned up your vocals. On the hook in the end there are a few times where you arent exactly on the beat but regardless you manage to be on the beat during the track. Again I dont really know what youre saying so Im not able to tell if your tone is appropriate to your content. The beat is great though but maybe the higher frequencies might need to be cut down.

7885512,0,t1_d42duff,Theyre certainly not complete shit I think some of the rhythms are really interesting. The main issue with them I think is that they all sound quite separated like theres no glue holding them all together if that makes sense. I would considering running your drums through a bus with a little bit of compression and EQ them to fit the mix neater. The main snare playing those sort of military trap type patterns sits nicely I think but I feel like theres not enough punch to that . You should layer another kick drum under that cut out the low end and pitch it up a little bit to make that bass hit harder and snappier. The ideas are there its just the technical shit that needs a little attention. But keep it up man sounding great.,makinghiphop,d42ekhi,1,t5_2sqw4

7925155,0,t3_4nodyg,I think the hardest part was getting to the point of knowledge and ability to understand what was happening in professional tracks to make them sound so good. Once you understand how the use of a compressor really makes the drums pop or the Eq leaves space for everything in your favorite track it becomes less about what is supposed to work more about what does and it becomes so much easier understand how to glue a track together.,makinghiphop,d46v26v,2,t5_2sqw4

Its not the average consumers fault they arent assholes for not paying. They have just become accustomed to music being free and accessible all over. The problem is huge for musicians because we all know nothing is going to stop the creative drive that lives in every artist even though theres hardly any money in it. Any other person would just say alright fuck it no ones paying me for this job so Ill find a different one which is a nearly impossible mindset for any artist to live with....If I didnt buy vinylrecords off bandcamp I would also be guilty of this because  of my listening happens through streaming.

8042190,0,t1_d4jupv5,that is pretty hard do you feel like it lacks something? I find that weve come to a point that the aesthetic of cover art that the general public finds appealing often has to be very minimalistic or very jam packed.examplesminimalism the cover art for panda desiigner  very basic nothing that will make you look around and find something new every time you look for itjam packed  a laced odyssey flatbush zombies  something you can look at while you listen to the music. It is to the album what a soundtrack is to a film.although these arent hand drawn I may be wrong about the flatbush zombiesanyway going back to my original thought  do you think the painting is lacking something? it seems to be a perfect blend of the  types of common art and perfect is almost synonymous for distasteful in modern hiphop. maybe Im just rambling tell me what you think...,makinghiphop,d4k0nbz,1,t5_2sqw4

8296625,0,t1_d5eiy7n,Im very familiar with their work. Mars Volta aint jazz and playing guitar in a psych rock band aint the same as being a jazz composer. Their stuff while incredibly tight virtuosic and played with wild psychedelic tones is pretty harmonically straight forward.Real jazz composers know how to reharmonize a passage in many different ways all about all of the chord extensions and how their alterations will subtly effect the feel and all about the intricacies of swing and polyrhythms. Even experimental noise artists normally come to that after studying and out growing traditional jazz.Im not trying to argue for arguments sake but I gotta disagree. Jazz at its core represents an experimentation in harmonic and rhythmic complexity from other genres from early uses of th chords the whole way through to todays incredibly complex harmonic jazz theory. You dont just stumble on that. It takes years of study. Especially for composers.Do you know of any jazz composers who dont know theory? Id be shocked. ,makinghiphop,d5emx6q,7,t5_2sqw4

While I do think it sounds good it doesnt sound all that new to me from what im hearing in that style of music these days that isnt to knock you because I know thats what you are going for.  Maybe because its not my preferred style.  The song is pretty long as well Id like to hear a switch in the sample or melody since its almost a  min long song.  Either that or maybe get some vocals or a rapper over it. Great start tho man keep it up.  Would appreciate some feedback from you since are styles are quite different.

I like itA Tru Savage is dope man I followed you after listening to that shit is mean dude. Cant really give any critiques there other than the fact that during the intro I didnt think Id like it all that much but I was wrong hahaOn the other hand on New Riot I loved the intro. The drums lack punch definitely could hit a lot harder in my opinion. The drop is interesting idk how I feel about it but its unique and its not like it sounds bad Im just not a big synth guy.

8422609,0,t1_d5ucgrd,Thanks for the feedback. I really like your track. The beat is solid. The lyrics have a good amount of humour. Only thing is the vocal quality. Are the low quality vocal recordings done on purpose? I think this low quality effect would work well in the interlude of an LP or something. It could be a great way of telling a story. I think if the track isnt going to be part of a themed collection of songs a higher quality vocal recorded might be beneficial. ,makinghiphop,d5ud9fo,1,t5_2sqw4

Vocals usually meet this criteria as does the master in the final stages.

8674844,0,t1_d6n72tm,Nice job taking the first plunge man this shit is addicting when you get into it! Id recommend you firstly focus on flow and delivery keep it basic for a week or two and really aim to get your flow riding comfortably on the beat. Your delivery should sound like you mean every single word and youre saying it with purpose. This comes with practice and comfort tbh but to guide you along try playing back your vocals then immediately after they end start listening to someone really confident like Kanye on a track like Power or whatever artist you like the difference in delivery should be clear as day dont be afraid to rerecord lines until you get that perfect confident sounding one. I used to do upwards of  takes to get something i liked its part of the process until it comes more naturally. Keep at it man!,makinghiphop,d6pz82a,1,t5_2sqw4

Chops are pretty on point. Kick could punch through more. Sounds like youre using a drum break so Im not sure exactly how you could do it but maybe if you split the track into a high and low pass and then just compressed the shit out of the low end you could punch the kick through more.,makinghiphop,d6y3bgd,1,t5_2sqw4

I didnt like my notsampledfromvinyl drums until I got a grasp on mixing because that shit just sounded like a bunch of sounds thrown together it wasnt cohesive. Choosing the right samples is important as is pitching them and mixing them nicely. A big factor here is compression on the drum bus and maybe even a touch of reverb can help bring everything together. If this isnt your issue then well damn lol. ,makinghiphop,d72dcmw,5,t5_2sqw4

It gets a little rough in the second half in terms of staying in the pocketThe lyrics are a pretty unfocused theres sex and not giving a fuck getting high and something about trap beats. It kind of sounds like a freestyle. All of those things can be in a rap but you should try to tie them together into a shared theme.

My sample game is mad weak but I completely agree a lot of beats sound raw because of the dusty and old samples producers find. I dont want to completely switch to analogue equipment because lets face it its  and computers are a necessity for almost every beat. I just want to know if I did continue to pursue old school production what equipment to buy. I understand it is totally economically inefficient to say fuck it and buy a ton of equipment but I feel like there are some controllers or samplers out there that could really help me out with all this. ,makinghiphop,d7mn7hm,1,t5_2sqw4

I like the frenetic flow but sometimes leaving a few kicks out is a good idea as your brain and ear fills in the spaces between if that makes any sense?

9119128,0,t3_555b8k,Practice practice practice. How many times do you record until you decide to call your track a finished product?  I never publish my first take..keep on practicing your written verses until you get good flow. Once you get a hang of the lyrics and the way the syllables should be laid out on beat your delivery will start getting more fit with the beat. I know it can be tough sometimes I used to just record two or three times and then Id think I would be done and get negative feedback in the DFTs about my flow. Forcing myself to continue redoing verses even after the first recording really helped my flow.,makinghiphop,d87yz15,2,t5_2sqw4

9168244,0,t1_d8dgoyd,Just gave this a couple listens. I really like the melody and I noticed a couple people saying the piano sounds out of place with the leading flute but I sort of like the differing sounds you have going on I think in music theory its properly called a fugue? The vocal samples are great too nice and dusty. You also did a good job creating space with your snare and hi hats hitting on the side and everything else in the middle. My suggestion would be to maybe pan the flute slightly left or right and the piano panned slightly the other way to create more space in case you want a rappers voice to sit in the middle of the track.  Other than that it was mixed really well and sounds great. Keep up the work.,makinghiphop,d8e54z7,1,t5_2sqw4

9346785,0,t1_d90r1cl,this is dope man. intro is super captivating and those little plucks ur playing chords with sound awesome. that breakdown u have at like  is dope when the high pitched kinda floaty plucks come in. i think u should use those more throughout it gives the whole beat a really dope feel. i think this is a super good track but i think its lacking some complexity that could turn it into a DOPE track. little things like risers impacts fills and cuts. for instance when u have that intro it leads into the main melody of track but it kinda feels empty. its like  seconds in. it could be as easy as throwing a white noise riser up to that point then having it cut out once that melody starts. other than that man this is super airy and really nice to listen to,makinghiphop,d90rt6b,1,t5_2sqw4

Its really a simple matter of googling free vst and going about looking through the options. Theres free producer packs online everywhere man you gotta look for it.

9521070,0,t1_d9mnkns,I actually quite like the chords and the hihat pattern. I the first thing I would do to improve this is definitely remove the sound effects. Secondly I think the clap is a little weak it might need some messing around with to improve perhaps some layering too. Thirdly I think perhaps you could do something to the main instrument to make it sound a little more exciting perhaps adding reverb and such?. Fourthly I think if you want to make it less simple some things to consider adding are a bass synth some higher sounds a pad or something with a shorter attack like a piano or bell etc maybe vocal chops etc. The kick sounds nice I would definitely keep that. ,makinghiphop,d9mo9x7,1,t5_2sqw4
9532774,0,t1_d9o2iem,track starts off a bit quiet which i think is fine but it goes on for a while i had to turn my volume up all the way to really hear it. really really dig those rhodes man the panning is on point and the second rhodes that come in at around  are dope as fuck. drums are nice though more variation to them wouldnt hurt. maybe add in an extra hit on the snare before the end of every other fourth bar. what you have here is dope already but i think its missing maybe just one more instrument to really meld everything together. maybe a muffled trumpet crescendoing at the beginning of every loop. besides the volume the mixing seems on point just get that volume up haha. good job bro.heres mine let me know if theres anything you would do to improve on it. thanks homie. ,makinghiphop,d9o44ih,1,t5_2sqw4
9533614,0,t1_d9o7eks,Listened to wanted.  The piano has a nice sound to it very wet and kind of ambient.   I like the delay on the snare and the kick sounds nice but I dont like the  used.  I think a slightly dirtier  would sound better.  I also think it could use a bit more filling in around the mid frequencies it has a nice vibe but it is a bit empty.

9576905,0,t1_d9tfkyw,Aight so the beat has a good vibe and the sequencingarrangementorder of it playing was good. But the drums are far to quite. In the mixer of your daw turn down the volume of everything and make the loudest thing the kick and folow it with the snare and the bass being the second and third loudest. Set the rest of the volumes off of that slightly quieter. Take a look at where panning wise you have the samples. Also dont be afraid to put your ryhme scheme more outside the beats and bars if that makes sense. It felt like some where forced or awkwardly timed but lyrically the content wasnt half bad just didnt flow,makinghiphop,d9tjruq,2,t5_2sqw4

9717752,0,t1_da963eb,This is dope! Super catchy! Id agree with the comments about the vocals. I think carving out space in the beat will be cleaner in the end. Listening again it sounds to me like above hz is a bit crowded in general. A lot of the synths have high end stuff going on plus the vocals and percussion. Id advise being more aggressive with the high passes and low passes. Comb filters can help empty out the high end of synths while still keeping them present. As long as you set them right theyre pretty stealthy and can help a ton. You could also just get rid of the high end of all your synths and make parallel channels with band passes on them as well. Just remember to keep k open for the vocals and sudoku that shit together.I think the drum samples could be more interesting? That snare in particular I feel like Ive heard a bazillion times. Even just adding a layer to it would go a long way! The kick could use a bit more high end its got nice punch to it but itll cut through the mix a bit more with some extra sizzle to it.If the vocals went up an octave at  thatd be hype. Feel free to hmu for mixing as well!,makinghiphop,daax9lb,2,t5_2sqw4

9844924,0,t1_daqomsr,Wow. You are legit made for hip hop. This beat shows so much depth and potential its crazy. The way you transition into the sample at around  seconds is dope af and the way you incorporate all the different elements of the beat is insane. I proper like the way the tone of the sample changes like its dropped an octave on some points and the outro works really well. Personally I feel the sample should be quieter as can overpower the verse portion of the beat so could be hard for vocals of a rapper to be on top only telling you cause you wanted honest feedback and with a beat like that think you can handle it.Appreciate if you took the time to check out our latest track. Were a UK hip hop collective and have been grinding for a while now. This is one of our more chill tracks so give us a like or follow if you enjoy it ,makinghiphop,daqtenv,1,t5_2sqw4

9858810,0,t1_darsqlx,I really like the beat. Your voice goes really well with the beat and I love your flow and lyrics. At times your voice slurred a tiny bit so Id work on articulating a bit more but thats hard to do in one take for a whole verse haha. The adlibs are really good. The second verse was sort of quiet so that could be turned up the ad libs felt like they overpowered it. The hook is awesome I really like every part of it. The last dude could have rapped to the beat a bit more the timing was sort of sloppy imo but the flow wasnt really bad. All the vocals could be mixed a tiny bit better though and eqd a bit better so they sit on the beat a little bit better. This is a really cool track though good job yo!,makinghiphop,dasmjpo,1,t5_2sqw4

9869739,0,t1_datu04x,I like what you do with the vocals and also how sparingly you use elements in the beginning. Creates a nice intro that teases all different parts of the beat before dropping in.I think those extra synths that come in around  are either mixed oddly or they just sound a little stock. Theyre kinda muddy and in the back there and dont fit right in my ears.I like what you do here in general though its got a nice progression and has a pretty typical trap vibe while still adding your own unique touch to it.

9890836,0,t1_dawscc2,the drum patterns you choose to use are super on the grid feeling imo and take away from the groove the back sampleinstrumentation has going on. I think if you gave your drums a little bounce in your patterns you would get more of a less rigid more of a cohesive feeling and the kill bill siren is a little played out i think you easily have had a more creative transition sound because the back instrumentation is super dope and if thats not a sample and made from scratch you are definitely headed in the right direction!,makinghiphop,dawsrx5,2,t5_2sqw4

10013196,0,t1_dbcqjps,Very true I remember when she put up that vid she was crazy good. I dont know if my covers stand out very much but I picked those two songs to do first Rigamortis and Speedom for a specific reason. I mean Kendrick Tech Krizz and Eminem are some of my favorites anyway but Ive read a lot of stuff around the internet about those two songs. Rigamortis the last verse especially is said to have been more than one take edited to together to make it sound like one crazy long breath basically making the song sound like he did it in like  breaths. I practiced that shit forever thinking well if Kendrick can do it then obviously its not impossible and by the time I could actually do it I found out that theres a chance it was just editing trickery lol and same thing with Speedom. Loved it since the first time I heard it by the time I could do it all with no mistakes I read that Eminem actually admitted to slightly speeding up a couple parts. So I can do those two songs as they sound no editing or speeding up but Im sure there are many other people that can do that as well so I dont know if just those two songs would be anything to make someone look twice lol,makinghiphop,dbcqy3s,1,t5_2sqw4

Add a shit ton of reverb on it add a flanger just mess around and know that your voice is an instrument too.Id add some higher quality drums which could make it lot more interesting. If you dont have it already Id recommend getting the cardiak drum kits you can download them off of rdrumkits.But overall I see potential in using your voice to create something truly unique and dope.

I like it when the beat drops but like I dont know man all of the instruments seem to just be separately played at the same time not really meshing together. Maybe some reverb and eqing might help with that but I dont know enough to really say.You got the tools to achieve more though so keep going,makinghiphop,dbqhm54,1,t5_2sqw4

Most likely two things are going to happen either the producer will gladly let you use the beat without charging you or they will have you get a lease for the beat.

I understand that hip hop is highly supportive of the egotistical Im fuckin hot shit mentality but dont kid yourself. Youre just going to be disappointed.I see too many selfproclaimed rappers coming out of the woodwork talking about how the shit they dropped is super hot fire and how they got mad skills. I go to listen and what do I get? Unmixed unmastered sloppily delivered offbeat hot ass garbage.Who told you that this was good? How long have you been training? And yes I said training. You think rap is different from any other highly complex musical art form? Could you pick up a guitar for a year and start composing your own shit and claim that youre Hendrix reincarnate? Ive been rapping for  years and for a while all I wrote was garbage. But I kept going. Studying the hell out of any style that I hadnt already learned. If you cant emulate someones style and make a song that sounds like said rapper wrote that shit for you then youve got some work to do. Yeah I get it. There are sooo many rappers in the mainstream that have made it without training and emulating styles. Some are like I just started rapping yo. All these young dudes riding this mumbletrap wave come to mind. But thats not you. You wanna have bars? You wanna be recognized for more than just your level of hype? You want to blow minds when you part your lips and start spitting because of the sheer level of skill youre portraying by speaking WORDS? Dont follow the mainstream for that. Thatd be like trying to beat Beethoven by copying Top . Just... do better. Words to live byIf you think youre good youre not good enough. If you think youre good enough you can be better. If you think youve gotten better youre far from the best. If you think youre the best kill your fucking self.

10311651,0,t1_dccvdub,Thanks bruh!  Preciate it!  Your track was pretty dope as well!  Drums were great!! They may have been slightly too loud though specifically the hi hats and the cymbals I would probably turn those down a bit and let the snare carry the drum pattern while letting the melody shine thru because it sounds very nice.  Other than that this was really nice great sounds!  Keep it up!,makinghiphop,dccvr5x,1,t5_2sqw4
10320676,0,t1_dcdvugj,what do you mean didnt turn out good? for your first time this isnt bad.  Basskick sounds a little muddy and snare could be very slightly louder. good beat structurecreepy melody. Make sure to pan your hihats like  left or right and other melodies like  with the main melody in the middle. atleast thats how i do it. thoughts?,makinghiphop,dcdwlp5,1,t5_2sqw4

10447428,0,t1_dcsafkv,Im digging it. The one thing is that the mixing with the vocals feels odd for whatever reason might be the mic as others have mentioned. I do think that with a beat with as much empty space as this you might want to fill that space more with either more layered production or more fastpaced delivery and your delivery as is works pretty well with the beat. But overall I like it.,makinghiphop,dcsb06b,1,t5_2sqw4
10447624,0,t1_dcsak44,I dig it that voice that comes in every once in a while is a little annoying though tbh. It doesnt do anything for me and just kinda distracts from the track as a whole. I think a sub bass might do you some favors the bass you have right now is kinda ostentatious but it works. I think a more subtle bass would give you more melodic capabilities and that could set this track apart. Which isnt to say it doesnt work as it is and it does.,makinghiphop,dcsbtjc,1,t5_2sqw4

10558082,0,t3_5r6hd0,Ok so Im a manager of sorts nothing big is happening as of yet but I still have a lot of contacts in the music industry locally that some of the artists Im involved with dont necessarily have. So what I do is get a good knowledge of as much of everything as I can. Im no producer good writer not the best photograpercinemtographer not the best advertiserpromoter but Ive learned the basics of everything or am in the process of learning. This helps and I think is useful for everyone involved in the process because it gives you the ability to know the capabilities of whatever you are working on writingphotographyproducingetc. This way you may find something you excel at photography for example and that way you can handle some aspects of things yourself and therefor save yourself money. Long story short while I do not think its necessarily a good idea to do everything yourself. I do think you should at least attempt to learn how to do everything to the best of your ability because when you get the oppurtunity to collab with other parts of the industry you can communicate what you want and be more precise understanding concepts of all these parts and in return get more quality material that reflects your art for lack of better words more accurately as a whole.Or who knows you may be a whole do it yourself guy.

10615384,0,t1_ddaw2ry,That vocal sample is dope and works really well with the synths. I think less might be more with this sample use though like if you just had it coming in for a stab or two instead of having it be like a melody like just one stab every  beats or something. Maybe try it for a switch up. Like as is the sample definitely works but it might be a nice counter point having it hit infrequently at some moments as well. You do that already by bringing the sample out entirely and then bringing it back in which is what gave me the idea of just having it start to stab after that because at first I thought thats what you were doing and I was like damn this slaps. Cant really think of anything else Id change I really like this.Mine ,makinghiphop,ddawadb,2,t5_2sqw4

10919839,0,t3_5w08li,Gsnap is a pretty good start for a free plugin to play around and see if you like it. Its important to note that autotune will only really kick in if you are holding tones long enough for it to detect and correct them though. I think there are more sensitive ones. I particularly like MAutoPitch for it.

I personally think some gear is essential for example My first  months or so I clicked and dragged everything on my DAW. After I got a midi controller and became comfortable it enhanced my creativity immensely and improved my beats in many aspects overall. Just dont go crazy with a bunch of gear at once and learn piece by piece and slowly upgrade And i personally think it will enhance your creativity to have different tools at your disposal. ,makinghiphop,de7coa4,2,t5_2sqw4

10967639,0,t1_deb7fo4,The chorus is not mixed very well at all. It sounds really..... off. I cant put my finger on why but I think the volumes are proportionally off so they dont blend well at all. Also that third verse is hard to hear due to the high synth that comes in at that point. Last thing maybe less double tracking all over the place. It doesnt seem as necessary the song makes it seem. Using it this much kinda lessens the effect of it. I like the verses though for the most part. Fun listen. ,makinghiphop,deb8gbz,1,t5_2sqw4

10976677,0,t3_5wlncz,My town is pretty old school  people but the biggest thing here is rodeos. There is a small HipHop scene pretty much consisting of people I went to high school with and they make very mainstream music. Also my local is very small. Two hometown artist collated and got about k plays on a song within a month they post it on FB and such. The same guys then drop a song without posting it to FB and got about  plays in a month. with that said I dont really want to join my community i know the whole scene and my style of hip hop is way more dark and not something i think youd want to hear at a show. I use twitter to talk to other artists and producer and to give my self a voice and then i use two soundcloud accounts to promote myself by kindly asking people if they would listen to my shit. My most played track is at something but I feel that i am very slowly building up a core internet fanbase by engaging and communicating with people.

10993771,0,t1_dedvqfp,Your style is really dope and you are really dialed into how to use autotune. I think if you varied the notes you were hitting a little more it would be hotter sometimes you gravitate to the same note too much. I think your ad libs arent nearly as good as your main vocals are like your main vocals sound dope af and on some next level shit compared to the ad libs that are complimenting them so pay some more attention to making the ad libs more interesting. How to do that I have no ideas nor suggestions but Im sure you can come up with some hot shit. Those s are hot af.  I think the kick could be more present. I think the ambient synth is kind of drowning out the rest of the beat and could be lowered a tad to give some more room to the keybell synths.

11012026,0,t1_deg4fyt,I like it. I think you achieved the PND vibe pretty good. I would recommend increasing the attack on the pad itself because the click to me is distracting and a sign that it wasnt properly done. If that was your goal then its ok but I feel like thatn dipping click is very distracting since it clashes with frequencies. To eb honest the volume ratio from beat to vocals are the same as PND so I wouldnt worry too mcuh aboout it. I would try panning some stuff so it doesnt seem so stale though. Pretty cool idea.

Snare could also probably use a few more dB.  If you fattened up the lows and made the snare a little bit more prominent this would be a dope ass track.  If you want to add a little more complexity a few extra drums probably wouldnt hurt.  Good shit tho keep workin on it!  Definitely impressive if youve only been making beats since January.

Sounds highly suspect I know but in short samples.If youre afraid of getting sued like I am record yourselfothers singing and play around with the vocals. Its a cheap mimic but Im slowly getting better at it and it works as well as it sounds like it would. If you want that genuine vibe though look through some soul samples maybe you can pull a Drake and find something not associated with anything so you dont have to get it cleared.

11157267,0,t1_dev2cya, is nice and tight and the melody has a good feel to it the  line I mean. I like your main melody as well with the piano  keys. The pads in the background arent really noticeable until you focus on them which is perfect. They add a ton of ambiance though. Good sound choices and progression. I dont really have much I can critique dude! The one thing I can offer is that after your bridge around  maybe come back in with a slightly different melody or a new element? I think theres room to add some kind of higher pitched thing there or like some vox chops that match your melody. Ill happily throw something over that part quickly for you if you have any interest in hearing what I mean. Otherwise the track is dope!,makinghiphop,dewnxei,1,t5_2sqw4
11159672,0,t1_dewx5r3,Cool track idk how well those vocal samples fit if its a regular beat though. Also the piano in the first part feels like its lacking some lower end frequencies Id try to fix that. The second part is cool but the strings just swallow the entire mix. Id lower the volume on them it would improve the clarity at the end. Overall a cool track I like how the piano is contrasted with the record scratch effects it sounds nice. ,makinghiphop,dewxqg9,1,t5_2sqw4

DErricoA thesis study into  prominent hip hop artists DJ Shadow Madlib and Flying Lotus. He mainly focuses on MPC techniques and uses over time. For me I found the DJ Shadow chapter not as helpful as the others. It still helped provide a nice frame for the others.Lateral Dynamics Processing in Experimental Hip Hop Flying Lotus Madlib Oh No JDilla and Prefuse An peer reviewed article on the use of compression in hip hop. Though these techniques will not be anything new to an intermediate level producer it is still good to see them in print and that the scholarly community is looking at us and studying our use of extended sound design as a form of musical expression.This whole Journal is great but there are a few other gems that are great reads. The Brazilian Electronica Of Csar Camargo Mariano And Prisma  Hybridization Or Tradition?A look into early adoption of new technology in Brazil and how they were adapted to suit the Brazilian aesthetic. This article also confirmed for me that some of the best digging is not only done in the record store but in books too.What is a Jazz Record Anyway? Lennie Tristano And The Use Of Extended Studio Techniques In JazzA look into the controversy Lennie Tristano caused by using overdubs in his recordings. An interesting look at what makes a certain style of music authentic or not.Making Beats The art of sample based hip hop Joseph Glenn Schloss bur.stdroxmyspacehiphoppaper.pdf Edit Sorry reddit doesnt like this linkIm currently reading this so I cant comment too deeply. So far it has broadened my understanding of the history and the issues being faced at the time. Feels a bit outdated but still an interesting read.RESOURCEBOOKPDF Behind the Beat Hip Hop Home Studios such as DJ Premier J Dilla Madlib and DJ ShadowA look into the home studios of notable producers  from the last decade. Published in  it is quite dated but still a great book. A reflection of the times. What I love most about this book is that I found it here.Edit Fixed broken linksEdit Id like to include bit music theory Adam Neely Bass Lessons and Sideways as excellent youtube channels for understanding music theory and extended techniques and issues related to music.bit music theory explains a concept of music theory through the analysis of a video game soundtrack. He is mindful of people new to music theory so explains things well.Adam Neely not just bass lessons but more the greater world of music making and the issues that arise from it. Sometimes hell do something more in depth composition or other times hell talk about a specific issue. He is very knowledgeable and will touch on many topics.Sideways this guy does amazing content. Its a pity he has done so few videos. He mainly looks at music in film but dont let that stop you. Analysis of a certain device and how it could be done better. He uses fairly intermediate music theory terminology so dont worry if you have to look up a word or two. ,makinghiphop,dezpmu3,5,t5_2sqw4

11203138,0,t3_5zvmz5,try flipping a sample that you find that you think doesnt fit. you might be surprised at how it turns out. the style of sound youre going for whatever that may be comes more from how you flip it rather than the source. when I really practiced chopping and started to get better at it it was like it opened a whole new door for me. things that I never used to think were flipable suddenly seemed like they could work. Getting a Maschine which makes chopping and playing chops fast and intuitive helped me personally with this too,makinghiphop,df1v0jy,2,t5_2sqw4

11263325,0,t1_df89tkp,Ooh  that arpeggiated synth is dope at the beginning.  Especially how it fades in for when the first verse hits.  I like how you leave the drums empty at first with just the bass and then bring in that snare and triangle and hi hats  sounds great.  Bass line is dope  I really like how you use the pitch bend? at some points.  Not a giant fan of how the horn hits throughout the track  just personal preference though.  Dope beat  nice fade out at the end as well..,makinghiphop,df8ojjb,1,t5_2sqw4

11291113,0,t3_611wqy,Got two gigs over this weekend on the sp. I love rocking in with a little sampler and playing a full set.As said by everyone else you have to find your own way. I would suggest using only the SP and a turntable by itself for a month or so. This will speed up your workflow and make you familiar with all the effects.Khyros set had the opposite effect on me I didnt want to do what he was doing. Why do whats already done? That was my reasoning. So instead of asking Khyro what to do I asked myself. Its the longer route but more rewarding. Feeling now that that decision payed off,makinghiphop,dfbtxsr,3,t5_2sqw4

11316385,0,t3_61i4sj,I flipped through your last beat tape you got solid skills and was a good tape from a quick listen didnt have much time. Id say its mainly because with blogs you have to be really good and fit a certain soundqualitypopular style at the moment. You made a good lofi tape but there is also a ton of artist doing short lofi tapes atm. So even if your good at what you do they are looking for the few great people that stick out from the thousands of others. TAs for reddit most of the subs people  want people to listen to their stuff just like you but the majority could careless about the music from their peers and ignore it. I noticed your tape got overlook on here too which is weird consider it was pretty solid. Normally it would of gotten a view upvotes and replies might of just been a bad time. Could also be because your a newer name around here so no one really recognized you so they didnt pay attention.Id recommend if your not already doing it do some of the beat challenges and just keep contributing to the sub and people here will definitely give your music some attention. Like I said your tape inst bad I wouldnt take it personally just the nature of the internet. I dont have much of a following myself so I cant really give you much more feedback than that but trust me many other have your same problem all over the net.,makinghiphop,dfeozpm,10,t5_2sqw4

As weird as it is to say this is the one time I where I really noticed the difference between wav and mp files. The wav file has the vocals sit much better with the rest of the mix.As for your trackI always dig lofi tracks and this is great! The kick and snare are delicious and I loved the bird sounds you layered into the track. The piano felt a little too distorted but thats a personal decision.

11688408,0,t1_dgkul87,I was waiting for the chord to change to be honest. If you would do that you can return back to the original chord so it sounds fresh again. If that makes sense. The drums are a bit to clicky for my taste. You could saturate them a little to soften the attack without losing any perceived loudness. And maybe add a little bit of sustain by using some parallel compression. The drums also need more low frequencies to beef them up a bit. I would use a medium tight notch and boost few dB in the low mids on the kick and the snare. And while listening the second time I thought you should balance the mix a bit more toward the drums and make them a bit louder in relation to the pad sound. I like the little fillsbreaks maybe you could do some more of them to bring some extra dynamic in your beat. If you want you can return feedback here ,makinghiphop,dgkwdb4,2,t5_2sqw4
