3627331,0,t1_cq5q66o,a I agree completely. The fact that this wasnt mentioned was a huge mistake.b IFC was not in the original package when the product launched. IMO because it could be called a free addon to the base package there wouldnt be any reasonable expectation to lower the price. The price you are paying now was the price it was before IFCAMC were added. Not saying I agree with this but it would be a decent argumentc I dont personally think this would be a reasonable request. Maybe they give everyone a free week of HBO and then change the wording on the site to something like AMCIFCAEHistory available with reservations. Im probably giving way to much credit to sling and maybe Ive started to become too much of a fan boy but the fact Sling was even able to get these networks on a platform that could hinder cable is pretty stunning.

5442399,0,t3_3pdf61,Ive been using Sling on my Roku LT and HTPC since launch. Neither has been ideal but not bad enough to make me cancel either.  I wanted Sling primarily for ESPN and other sports viewage secondarily to spite Comcast et al.  Roku LT It works but feels sluggish and janky.  It takes  seconds to switch channels measured from button press to start of new stream.  Scrolling through channel listings and viewing program details is an exercise in patience with response typically coming a second or more after pressing a button on the remote. The Sling app sometimes spontaneously reboots not too often for me maybe once or twice a week.I believe the LT is the lowestspecd Roku supported by Sling so Im not too surprised by the slowness. And for the most part its tolerable because month.During my first several months of Sling ESPN and ESPN streamed at .Mbps on the LT delivering a wonderfully smooth especially important for sports and crisp picture.  No other channels appeared to do this at the time maxing out at .Mbps for a choppier framerate but one perfectly adequate for Law amp Order reruns and reality TV.  Sadly but hardly surprisingly framerate wasnt dialed up for sports events like March Madness on TBSTNT.Strangely the quality of the streaming itself seems to have gone downhill in recent months particularly on ESPN.  I can no longer achieve .Mbps ESPN and all other channels max out at .Mbps.  Has anyone else noticed a similar change in quality?  My internet isnt terribly fast Mbps down but it worked fine and dandy for months why would it suddenly degrade?Ive also had a devil of a time getting ESPN to stream on any Sling device during Monday Night Football games.  WatchESPN is an adequate workaround but I shouldnt need to do this!HTPC Much more responsive than the LT in all ways.  My only complaint interfacewise is that I have to navigate with a mousekeyboard as far as I know remote control support would be fantastic.However the HTPC has an Achilles heel a very noticeable stutter in streams that would otherwise appear to be as smooth as the glorious .Mbps mentioned above I cant find a way to display the current connection speed on the PC app.  This has always been the case in my experience no odd drop in quality recently as with the Roku LT.  But that damned stutter!  It happens about every second  its most noticeable when watching the ESPN crawl which will move backwards for a splitsecond.  This makes Sling on my HTPC all but unwatchable I cant stop fixating on the blip.Has anyone shared measured resolution target bitrate and framerate recently?  All I can find is this wonderful report but its from February.  If Sling is lowering quality thats pretty darn disappointing.  If the reduced quality could somehow be an issue with my setupconnection Im open to suggestions!,slingtv,cw7bi1p,1,t5_35q6u

9120658,0,t3_54b2y9,FXNow works on Android for me including Chromecast but there is a trick to it. You wont see Sling as a provider in the app. You need to sign in to the FoxNow app first then when you open FXNow you will be automatically signed in. Im really hoping they work out deals to get other networks apps working too. ,slingtv,d885kje,2,t5_35q6u

9399982,0,t1_d97f1sp,Yep. I had the same experience with Vue. Worked fine sometimes then terrible on peak periods or popular content. Everything else I have works perfect and everything tests fine. I feel like theyre trying to somehow do this without actually sinking too much into it. Or maybe in the case of the TV providers they figure this will satisfy the people who hate cableDBS but if it sucks and they come back... fine with them. But I do hope it improves because overall its a good thing.,slingtv,d97ii0o,2,t5_35q6u
9411944,0,t3_59j1h2,Exactly!! I tried my hardest to like it on my apple TV but its horrible. For me its a combination of Apple and Sling but more on Sling.  Why do I blame Apple... well they talked about it in there key note as a flagship app and its was HORRIBLE unwatchable when it came out.  Then they fixed it and now this past week well I bought a fireTV yesterday cause wow almost broke my TV.  In the end when I PAY for a service I kind of expect it to work ,slingtv,d9912zp,3,t5_35q6u

10910711,0,t3_5vuyri,I did but it was well over a year ago. I was using the PC version with a VGA to RCA breakout box and it worked fine even at the tvs native resolution from what I remember. I dont believe I had to do anything like setting the computers output to a higher res and letting the box downscale which is necessary for a lot of other stuff because certain ui elements just wont render at low resolutions. And I mean basic important things like the full screen button on cbsnews.com. Caveat this was with an older version of the Windows app. I have no idea if it still works that well and I doubt say the Amazon Fire version with an HDMI to RCA box would work as well because I really doubt you can knock the resolution low enough for the ui to work well in standard def.  Edit actually now that I think about it there was one quirk at x. I could only get the window big enough for the full screen button to show up by stretching the window onto my main monitor. As long as most of it was on the TV thats what it went fullscreen on and once it was fullscreen everything worked.,slingtv,de5d265,1,t5_35q6u
10935385,0,t1_de7r181,Yes the AirTV. Now by coincidence I picked up another one and plugged it in last night to preset it up so to speak for use in a few days and it behaved the same way. I cleared cache stopped and started the app again and it was still mostly empty ribbons under whats on now and some empty placeholders elsewhere. Maybe its their boxes. Its tough to accept because that box was supposed to be a DishSling tuned partnership. In reality though its nothing more than just another Android TV box.I have zero problems on the same box with any other app including Vue Hulu Netflix. I did just check out my laptop on wifi only  and the program runs great. The only other app that runs rough is that bootleg Directv Now.Crazy frustrating!,slingtv,de7wp9y,1,t5_35q6u
