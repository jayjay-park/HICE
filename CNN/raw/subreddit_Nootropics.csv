Im not saying it should be but it is and this sub doesnt have a problem with helping people obtain scheduled drugs without a doctors prescription.    So I dont think its the law or ethics of listing banned substances but maybe the assumption that just because they are banned they are effective good healthy or something to try out for fun.

26573,0,t3_1uav8c,Ive been taking it daily for about  months. I got it from alldaychemist. I dont take amphetamine regularly so I get pretty profound effects either way. But memantaine is supposed to reduce tolerance and return that initial amphetamine awesomeness.The effects I get initially were an increase in energy and a perky mood in general with some very vivid dreams. This would happen for  days whenever I adjusted my dosage. I started at mg and went up to mg. At mg I get a sense of contentedness and okayness with life. Sort of like I am in my safe bubble from the negatives of the outside world if that makes any sense. I also notice much less rumination and worrying about bullshit. I reduced the dosage back to mg because I was getting a little too content.But overall its a pretty good medicationnootropic apparently it has neuroprotective properties as well?.

95093,0,t3_1v6c2k,I know you asked for nootropics but as someone who has struggled with feeling motivated to do anything worth while damn you ADHD brain I would like to ask if you work out regularly and if so what you do? Amphetamines and other stimulants are a good short term fix but personally I find that by flooding my brain with dopamine arbitrarily eventually leads to motivation to do nothing for example when I first started taking vyvanse I was incredibly productive but within  months I was ore likely to focus in on reading  hours of reddit threads than accomplishing my goals. Testosterone and adrenaline both have significant affects on my motivation levels and since I got my home gym set up thanks to my awesome wife the first thing I do very morning is lift some heavy shit and mark off the weights etc on my calendar. After that I tend to feel like superman and am ready to take on any challenge I also tend to eat better afterward which results in more sustained energy and motivation.Iv also found that intermittent fasting helps me in a similar way I imagine this has something to do with steady energy levels using fat as primary energy source and resultant gastrin levels.Not trying to dissuade you from taking noots I take a hell of a stack myself I just feel like motivation is hard to manufacture artificially without negative consequences and a lot if it is hormonal which can be influenced fairly easily with behavioral changes barring some pathological hormonal deficit which requires medical intervention.,Nootropics,cep98pj,29,t5_2r81c

293824,0,t1_cfb6d4i,Hey no problem!  Glad to help.  www.nootropicsdepot.com will ship to the UK you shouldnt have any issues.  I have depression as well and have tried many treatments so hopefully I can dish out some advice on your SAD as well.  St. Johns Wort is pretty good for SAD.  I personally dont really like most of the traditional treatments for depression.  Although St Johns Wort has been shown to be just as effective at treating depression as traditional SSRIs SSRIs honestly dont have that good of a track record themselves.  You could try it out if you want though.  Keep in mind it is a pretty potent inhibitor of CYPA in the liver so like you said you need to watch out what you mix with it.  I tried it for about four months and didnt feel much of a difference but many people swear by it.     However there are other approaches that I personally believe to work better than St. Johns Wort  and even SSRIs for that matter.  First and I know it sounds like I am raving about ashwagandha but it has been shown to relieve depression.  Now I dont think its the best treatment for depression its more for antianxiety but why not kill two birds with one stone?  Heres more information on all the awesome things ashwagandha does  Second you could try Tianeptine which is sold by nootropicsdepot.  Many say that it is very effective in relieving anxiety and depression.  I have tried it and absolutely loved it.  It definitely gave me a noticeable mood boost relieved anxiety and really made me feel at ease with the world and everything that was going on around me.  The thing that sucks is that you need to take it three times a day .mg.  Check out the wikipedia page and see if it is something that interests you.  I think it would be well suited for you because it also has significant anxiolytic effects.    I have been on St. Johns Wort Mirtazapine Trazodone Zoloft Bupropion Tianeptine and several others.  The only ones that worked for me were Bupropion which you need a prescription for and Tianeptine.  If you want more information on any of these drugs let me know.  Most would require a visit to the doctor in order to get a script.    Also uparmatrix works for nootropicsdepot.com and has a lot of really good advice on their products.  They try out all of their products before they put them up for sale and he has referred me to some really awesome supplements that have changed my life.  Hes a really friendly guy so I would shoot him a message confirm that they ship to the UK Im almost positive they do and you could even ask him what he would recommend for your SAD.,Nootropics,cfb7xpi,3,t5_2r81c
302125,0,t3_1xhl1w,To my knowledge no studies have been performed on the combination of Amphetamine and any of the racetam compounds. Therefore the answer is that we dont know. Anyone who tells you otherwise is merely conjecturing.Keep in mind that we still dont even know if amphetamine Adderall alone is free from neurotoxic effects. We know that its neurotoxic in rodents and some nonhuman primates often at levels that are seen in treatment in humans. We also know that people who have a history of amphetamine exposure in their lifetime have a higher incidence of Parkinsons disease for example. None of this is conclusive in humans of course but its worth knowing.Personally Id recommend steering clear of Adderall unless youve legitimately exhausted all of your other options. Combining Adderall with poorly understood compounds Any of the racetams seems like one step beyond that so Id recommend against that as well.,Nootropics,cfc2xsf,1,t5_2r81c

459675,0,t1_cfsif71,I downvoted not because I dont think your intent is good but because I think you should provide more information about htp.From what Ive read theres not a lot of evidence that its helpful or that it effectively increases serotonin in the right places. Its also worth asking the OP why they think they want more serotonin. If they are being prescribed Wellbutrin they may ask their doctor for a low dose of an SSRi.What they might expect from an SSRi is slightly more anxiolytic effects.  Actually I shouldnt really say that but some SSRis are more suited to a  sort of anxious depression. My experience on wellbutrin months was that it was like a strong coffee and also made me a little irritable but at the time was useful for getting through the lethargic portion of my depression before I really started working on it and while I was coming out of the very dark parts.  But ultimately I do not like wellbutrin. ,Nootropics,cfsijfm,2,t5_2r81c

Green tea extract is prepared from the dried green leaves of Camellia sinensis with a drugextract ratio of . ..  mm polyphenols highpressure liquid chromatography HPLC ..  mm caffeine HPLC ..  mm theobromine HPLC and ..  mm theanine HPLC. One gram of extract corresponds to . g of green tea leaves.That makes it seem like the drink is . extract standardized but the control drink also seems to have that amount but then again it probably doesnt. lt Rivella is a commercially available carbonated soft drink on the basis of milk whey.

614741,0,t1_cga3ktx,Ohh god dont make me the poster boy for this movement too! I already have enough arguing to do with other people. My point was not that taking fat with some fatsoluble vitamins will not help in all cases. It was that the idea that a fat soluble vitamin needs fat to absorb is patently false. Take vitamin D for example. It is a fat soluble vitamin and has poor absorption through the GI tract. And yes taking fat with it can help increase that absorption. However that is not because it gets enveloped in the fat allowing it to pass your membranes. Its because fat slows stomach motility allowing for more time to absorb it before being excreted. Take fat with another fat soluble vitamin like vitamin A and it does not increase absorption. Other poorly water soluble vitamins can have their absorption increased by having a fatty meal with it by signaling the release of bile salts which can then bind to the molecule and facilitate transport across the membranes. But on the same token some other fat soluble vitamins can actually have their absorption rates decreased by bile salts. So it really depends on the specific substance as to whether or not fat or protein for that matter will help with their oral bioavailability.So no a molecule being fat soluble does not automatically mean that it needs to be taken with fat to absorb. However some poorly water soluble molecules can have their bioavailability increased by taking fat with them due to downstream mechanisms relating to digestion while others may have their absorption lowered. Plus there are things like pH that need to be taken into account as well.You can read my rant on it here if you want. It says basically the same thing in more words.,Nootropics,cga5bgy,5,t5_2r81c

Again this isnt to say for a fact that it isnt more toxic than regular amphetamine however its hard to just trust this one anecdotal bluelight report in the absence of actual research. and. You gotta consider the source. Were talking about bluelight here. This person supposedly had an adderall script which he used fma to replace. This implies that he was already a regular user of amphetamines before he began using fma EVERY DAY. I would personally never use any sort of amphetamine regularly. Again he states that his friend suffered from signs of amphetaminelike substance overuse and I quoteIts actual similar to normal amphetamine overuse ...And he goes on to place the blame squarely on fma of course but with his friends extensive amphetamine history I would guess it isnt solely to blame. Like any RC it should be used VERY RESPONSIBLY if at all.,Nootropics,cgbd9hn,1,t5_2r81c

774361,0,t1_cgsa319,Tolerance stems from immediate early gene expression which is a downstream mechanism to calcium influx through the NMDA receptors. Decrease the calcium influx upregulate the IEGs that were downregulated from overstimulation.Sure a full antagonist like dextrorophan will be more effective at reversing that tolerance but memantine can help speed the process up during a break. If you are really serious about trying to fully reverse tolerance to stimulants I would suggest looking into stronger NMDA receptor antagonists. However its hard to function normally on those. That is why memantine is useful. Plus its  hour half life means that it can modulate the influx of calcium in a more steady fashion.gt Is the perception of tolerance reduction more reliant on the nAChR antagonizing effects?I guess that depends on what tolerance you are talking about.

If you feel like giving phenibut another try I recommend titrating up by mg at a time with ample time inbetween every dose. The warnings have been repeated ad nauseam so I wont repeat them here.I guarantee you that at a larger dose you will notice a pronounced effect. But whether that effect is what youre looking for is another sake. Taking too much isnt much fun it feels like being both drunk and hungover at the same time. Taking mg or whatever and expecting a pronounced effect is a little like drinking one or two beers and complaining that alcohol has no consciously noticeable effect. Some people are unusually sensitive but I suspect they are a minority.Its also worth it to take a sort of retrospective look at the effect. I could take my usual dose in the morning and forget all about it but come evening Ill usually notice upon reflection that its been an unusually good day.

1066409,0,t1_chpftmt,I could be wrong but my understanding is as follows Under normal conditions the brain is constantly rewiring itself by forming new neural connections and getting rid of old ones that are no longer being used as much. Ampakines increase neural plasticity accelerating the rate at which new neural connections are formed and contributing to faster learning. However the mechanism involved could also impair the pruning process which would result in learning that is less selective and hence more noisy.My personal experience with racetams is that they dramatically increase the rate at which I pick up everything. This includes valuable knowledge and skills but also useless knowledge bad habits etc. Things begin to move at a rate that I can no longer regulate properly through conscious attention and the end result is often bad. I may feel that the day is going well but by the next day Ill realize that I picked up a new pattern of behavior that I really dont like and it can then take an entire week for it to recede.,Nootropics,chpi7b3,12,t5_2r81c

1341270,0,t1_cikiaoo,ampampamp Neuropeptide sfw gtgtNeuropeptides are small proteinlike molecules peptides used by neurons to communicate with each other. They are neuronal signaling molecules that influence the activity of the brain in specific ways. Different neuropeptides are involved in a wide range of brain functions including analgesia reward food intake metabolism reproduction social behaviors learning and memory.gtNeuropeptides are related to peptide hormones and in some cases peptides that function in the periphery as hormones also have neuronal functions as neuropeptides. The distinction between neuropeptide and peptide hormone has to do with the cell types that release and respond to the molecule neuropeptides are secreted from neuronal cells primarily neurons but also glia for some peptides and signal to neighboring cells primarily neurons. In contrast peptide hormones are secreted from neuroendocrine cells and travel through the blood to distant tissues where they evoke a response. Both neuropeptides and peptide hormones are synthesized by the same sets of enzymes which include prohormone convertases and carboxypeptidases that selectively cleave the peptide precursor at specific processing sites to generate the bioactive peptides.  gtNeuropeptides modulate neuronal communication by acting on cell surface receptors. Many neuropeptides are coreleased with other smallmolecule neurotransmitters The human genome contains about  genes that encode precursors of neuropeptides. At present about  different peptides are known to be released by different populations of neurons in the mammalian brain.  Neurons use many different chemical signals to communicate information including neurotransmitters peptides and gasotransmitters Peptides are unique among these cellcell signaling molecules in several respects. One major difference is that peptides are not recycled back into the cell once secreted unlike many conventional neurotransmitters glutamate dopamine serotonin. Another difference is that after secretion peptides are modified by extracellular peptidases in some cases these extracellular cleavages inactivate the biological activity but in other cases the extracellular cleavages increase the affinity of a peptide for a particular receptor while decreasing its affinity for another receptor. These extracellular processing events add to the complexity of neuropeptides as cellcell signaling molecules.gtgtImage i  Neuropeptide YInteresting Neuropeptide Y | Neuropeptide Y receptor | Neuropeptide S | Neuropeptide FF receptor Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcikib oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeletecikib.

Did you have blood plasma levels measured periodically?  There are quite a few significantly different types of tricyclics out there.  Unfortunately people usually first line usage at least here in US are the older imipramine and amitryptaline  they tend to have the worst anticholinergic sideeffects sweating constipation urinary hesitancy.  Personally I have had luck with clomipramine a third generation tca that is basically the strongest fucking thing out there save for the nonselective and irreversible MAOIs mentioned above  they are in a league of there own  its as strong a SRI as many of the now popular ssris it is a strong antagonist at many of the individual serotonin binding sites this helps prevent the nausea and anhedonia common to many ssris its metabolite  desmethylclomipramine  is a NRI as strong as nortryptaline.  The sweating constipation lasted for quite some time.  the constipation subsided after  months the sweating continues but frankly its not that bad of a trade all things considered.Oh also look into mirtazapine as an adjunct if you are currently taking an ssri or snri.  Monotherapy w remeron doesnt seem to have much evidence supporting it but as an auxiliary to ssrisnri it basically adds a good booster via norepinephrine release and antagonism of individual serotonin receptor sites different that serotonin reuptake inhibition.  Also try and titrate up to the mg range.  In the US most dose it at mg but in Europe specifically Scandinavia a good amount of evidence shows the mg range to have the most effect.

Any impression any thought it doesnt matter  and do not judge your thoughts. Save the recording but dont listen through it. Do this for a week. Then find themes or listen through them with someone you trust or a therapist and then find ways to deal with the issues that keep coming up. What else? Meditation and entheogens. Psychotropic drugs  nootropics in particular  will not significantly help you or give you an advantage if youre dealing with emotional issues that are stopping you from using your own potential in the first place.

1730460,0,t3_2e8ngy,Through the use of stereological counting methods we observed a significant reduction  in dopamine neuron numbers in the substantia nigra pars compacta SNpc following chronic administration of  mgkg MPH. This dosage of MPH also induced a significant increase in the number of activated microglia in the SNpc. Additionally exposure to either  mgkg or  mgkg MPH increased the sensitivity of SNpc dopaminergic neurons to the parkinsonian agent methylphenyltetrahydropyridineMPTP.Collectively our results suggest that chronic MPH usage in mice at doses spanning the therapeutic range in humans especially at prolonged higher doses has longterm neurodegenerative consequences.  ,Nootropics,cjxaf6a,4,t5_2r81c

Longer sustained small doses would maintain a presence in the body whereas psychiatric level doses would diminish quickly.But psychiatric patients may take their huge doses for the rest of their life.gt Perhaps it helps psychiatric patients to have a higher dose because their body is metabolizing lithium they get incorrectly or they simply have very low levels so a higher dosage would get them back up to threshold that everyone else is already at. If this is the case then it would be obvious to say oh yeah look the lithium is fixing their problem when perhaps their problem to begin with was lower than normal lithium levels.Sure something like that might save the appearances but is there any particular reason to think so?gt Im not sure where people would get Lithium naturally now since we dont drink groundwater anymore it isnt put into our water and I dont think there are any food sources containing it maybe fish.People drink tap water all the time they bathe in it and plants amp animals accumulate it. One of the objections to the studies runs that since people tend to not eat local produce so much any more the variation from region to region should be swamped by the variation in lithium from foodstuffs and the measurement error makes the correlations worthless.,Nootropics,ckig5sa,3,t5_2r81c

Perhaps it has something to do with calcium deficiency one of the symptoms being insomnia.  I wonder if magnesium supplements alone will throw calcium levels off further.  Magnesium taken with calcium will aid in the absorption of calcium.  The ratio I am taking is far below the suggested calcium to magnesium ratio.  My guess is both calcium and magnesium are being absorbed at this ratio.All I can say for sure is that it works for me and the results are dramatic enough that I have ruled out the placebo effect. ,Nootropics,clsfl0u,1,t5_2r81c

Used twice a week I dont develop phenibut tolerance with or without faso.  ETD I lose some of the euphoria from phenibut wo faso but keep it with faso I actually had to lower my phenibut dose because my original dose it made me irritable.EOD No real tolerance build up with faso but I psychologically become more used to the experience and it thus becomes less special.ED tolerance increased from . g to g over the week.  Got diminishing returns so I tapered off over the next  days.

2477356,0,t3_2nvsea,Yo this guy. What this guy says  OP please take note of this what brainsandbrawn is saying and also let me clue you in on a little personal experience.I am a regular drug user and have tried every substance out there bar most of the RCs and Heroin... I know how substances feel and have managed to pull myself away from crippling addiction so with that in mind...I am  was in a state of manic depression. I say I am because I believe I am only keeping it at bay as soon as I stop being active it will come straight back. I took up the Gym in January. New years resolutions and all that. Like I dont care much for weights so I was mostly running in a spot.The first time I got on the treadmill I just pegged it for as far and as long as I could. I got off pretty knacked but felt amazing.The day after the next would have gone the next day but muscles not used to all the movement I did the same thing really pushed myself and went as far as I could again at about .  . MPH. Forced myself to run miles.I dont think I quite made it but when I stepped off that treadmill I wont ever forget it It had to have felt like a pretty heavy roll mixed in with a meth high. All my joints joints were loose and felt like they had no friction comparsed to the peak of my depression  where they felt like I had lead weights attached. I had energy from nowhere and I felt like well the best I had ever felt in a long time sober or not.Obviously I was panting and tired but Oh my fuck from that point on I was promised myself I would make the gym a regular thing. I felt satisfied and fulfilled like I had accomplished something huge.After getting changed and going home I still felt energetic. Did housework was in an extremely happy mood with like No anxiety at all. To be without worry for once was a totally new concept for me. I felt motivated to do tasks I would have otherwise required to be on amphetamines and even had the focus for doing them.The next day I got out of bed as soon as I woke up  that struck me as incredible as I would usually liein in a depressed Fuck it cant be bothered. mood for as long as possible.   months down the line and even though I couldnt afford to keep my gym membership going for the past  months I still feel fucking amazing compared to how I used to. TO maintain these feels I strive to be as active as possible. Even when I have nothing to do for the day I make a point of meandering around town going out to eat breakfast and interacting with people  strangers who serve me at shops. Little things help me get through the day such as small talk stopping to talk  listen to buskers  trolling people on video games  but one of the most essential and simplest Ive found is getting up and having a shower  looking after yourself. Also  from my experience and having been on numerous antidepressants I can tell you  that there is no Miracle Cure that can be sustained for long periods of time nor anything remotely effective against depression caused by loneliness. Socializing IRL not over games is often the best way to reducing your depressive symptoms It gets you out of the house talking and joking with others  which gets all of your cognitive synapses firing.Antidepressants should be used short term to give you the drive to go out there and do something to better yourself then weened off of  they are not something to fall back on or a allfixingcure. Particularly in the case of serotoninreuptake inhibitors such as Prozac and Citalopram. They can really fuck with your libido and make jacking off more of a chore. How can something designed to make you happy take away the best bit of jacking off!? Finally OP when down remember something I always remind myself sometimes aloud and with company resulting in some odd looksI am the result of billions of years of evolution I am the absolute latest generation of my species and the best there is to offer. Humanity literally does not get any better than me. Its true you really are something special and you should start having a positive self image. Youre no better or worse than anyone else out here and Its unfair for you to beat yourself into a pit of absolute depression because youre worth so much better than that. Start doing yourself a favor take pride in yourself. Youre worthy of respect from others but especially yourself.PM me if you like OP Im always on reddit and down to talk to you whenever.,Nootropics,cmhxejm,2,t5_2r81c

Reasons a health nut could be going to five different gyms a night has the fitness equipment they want and nothing else like a crossfit gym has a sauna but nothing else they want  has a pool but nothing else that they want offers cryotherapy but nothing else that they wantand  is a very basic gym with the essential freeweight equipment and is close to someplace theyll be when they want to do their second workout of the day. Alternately  offers an indoor track and nothing else that they want.

It seem to accentuate rather than induce anxiety.  There are times when I hit a sweet spot with yohimbe where it acts as a fantastic fast acting antidepressant when Im in a depressive episode or just a strong stim.  However if I have negative or anxiety provoking situations come up or take too much of it it often times makes me much more prone to anxiety.

2645230,0,t1_cn3som0,Yeah when I was diagnosed it was a huge relief. Im still learning how to take care of myself but this is something I can actually do now that I know whats wrong with me. Before it was just hopeless. Ive also been obsessive about research. Honestly I would be shocked at an aspie that didnt get obsessed with it when first diagnosed. Everyone Ive talked to seems so knowledgable about autism. I recently read a book called aspergirls by rudy simone and felt as if it was written about me. Ive never related to anyone my whole life and now there is this whole world of people online that are very similar to me. That is pretty much the greatest feeling.I definitely agree about pharmaceuticals. I would like to get off all the drugs I take eventually. I dont even think they help at all. Your comment makes me hopeful about trying alternative methods. When it comes to these types of things I trust other aspies more than doctors. I realize many people would think this was stupid but the truth is that my doctors have always been wrong about me. Part of this is my fault of course because of communication difficulties but they dont trust my instincts and they always treat me like a child. I know for sure this is because of my autism. Also I believe us aspies are all so sensitive that we are less prone to the placebo effect. I tried a dozen or so drugs for my migraines years ago and not one of them helped in the slightest. Then I found out magnesium helped and my pharmacist friend said well who cares if its really a placebo if its helping you right? It really upset me at the time. Keep in mind that I actually expected the meds to work and I didnt expect the magnesium to work. If it was placebo wouldnt the meds have helped even just slightly? Ive read that autists should take a third of the recommended dosage of any drug just because we are so sensitive.I dont think your comment is disorganized. I totally get the attention to detail part. I think most aspies are like this and I can always follow their train of thought if its typed.    Im going to look into the things you mention in your last paragraph. Besides potentially helping me this is all incredibly interesting. I definitely want to learn about the relation to gaba b function. I dont know what my magnesium source is or even the brand but I will definitely look into it. The baclofen description on wikipedia sounds kind of amazing Im going to research it further.

2728584,0,t1_cndgrf5,Without a whole lot to go on in English at least I would personally exercise caution but would imagine no contraindications to exist. The drugs main effect seems to be increasing LDOPA and dopamine in the nucleus acumbuns. From what I can tell it achieves this by increasing the levels of tyrosine hydroxylase. It increases the sythesis of dopamine. Tianeptine seems to cause release of dopamine in the nucleus acumbuns so there may be an increased effect when the two drugs are combined.Some literature mentions increases in serotonin in the PFC from bromantane. Tianeptine has been used safely with ssris so this should be ok.Based on its adamantane backbone Id imagine bromatane may have some anticholinergic effects as well as some NMDA antagonism. If it does this shouldnt be a problem.No controlled studies exist showing safety in combining the two drugs.Based on whats known of the mechanisms of the two drugs keep in mind we do not know the exact mechanism of either drug I would say to exercise caution. ,Nootropics,cne88ll,3,t5_2r81c

2833106,0,t3_2sf1r7, Dosages should be adjusted until desired effects are met. Although you want to dose as small as possible. From my research there are two ways to loaddose racetams. You can start at a moderate dose for your weight and taper up or you can megadose and load up the brain with racetam and taper down. I did a mixture of both. I started at g Piracetam with mg Centrophenoxine BID. This stack was continued for  days to ensure I actually liked the substance and there were no side effects or bad reactions. Then I megadosed the Piracetam to g with mg of Centrophenoxine BID. I have been taking this with great results for  months with weekends off. Aniracetam is great too. I find its a little more relaxing. I take this sometimes with my PM stack to wind down after work. As for dosing see above. Keep in mind Aniracetam is fat soluble slow acting and has a long half life. Aniracetam must be taken with some kind of fat or oil to absorb best. I have read taking Aniracetam with milk works and doesnt taste any different. I usually take all noots together with orange juice my multivitamin and fish oil. The fish oil allows the fat soluble noots to absorb.  Seems as though we are using noots for the same purpose. Im trying to dive into music production again. I take Piracetam Centrophenoxine and ALCAR daily. Also I have been an MJ smoker for years. I feel that helps a ton with creativity and feeling music.

2845350,0,t3_2sokf2,Dopamine is the neurotransmitter of approach released when your brain wants to condition an affinity for something so it makes sense that it would also produce an analgesic effect Combined with the opioid agony of tianeptine I would say it could make a potent painkiller in sufficient doses.Im very glad youve found a means of relief. I would try to understand the chemical interaction going on as best you can and try to find an alternative without the tianeptine as Ive heard it can cause tolerancedependency if used chronically.

I look at the weight lifting community as a good example. The studies they do have are almost all very low N studies without good compensation for confounds. But if you watch their community over time after the first couple of months of Wow this new thing is amazing! it evens out and their tribal wisdom turns out to be pretty spot on. They have it easier than us though because their thing has pretty clear cut measures. You gain X on your lifts over time or lose Y of body fat. We dont have such clearcut measures but are in the same boat. There is very very little research out there on cognitive enhancement except in pathological cohorts. So we have to extrapolate from animal stuides effects on alzhemiers patients and the overall tenor of ancedote from our community.And in the comments he made a think of the children! argument.

3101385,0,t1_coiv4uj,That is true to some extant the extraction process used is very important. As well as the fact that the mycelium and the fruit bodies have very different chemical make ups. Making a tea from the fresh or dried material and dumping the solids is definitely a waste. This holds true for Reishi mushroom as well. All of this is in addition the genetic lottery that is mycology. If these mushrooms are wild gathered the variation can be even greater. Luckily this is usually not the case. Most suppliers have contracts with cultivators who have a very large degree of control over the genetics that their farm uses. Remember however that nootropic usage is not the main commercial concern for these companies. Immunostimulant effects are often what has been selected for. If your supplier does not spell out the fact that they are interested in hericenones  and erinacines then trial and error or customer reviews are your only recourse. Dont write off a company because they do not market to nootropics users...there are some wonderful house strains that have been around for decades from ATCC and Aloha and others that suit our needs perfectly. But in the last few years a few of the larger suppliers have begun to offer products with different chemical profiles based on different extraction techniques as well as different genetics.So in my opinion and experience when you find one you like...stick with it.,Nootropics,cojggyk,2,t5_2r81c

3248414,0,t1_coygabo,Alright so I briefly read over the PhenibutBaclofen articles again. I think I know why I am getting extremely confused. You kept saying Phenylalanine but did you mean PEA Phenylethylamine? If so yes a rebound in PEA is likely to add do withdrawlanxiogenic effects. Though I believe the true problem with Phenibut withdrawl is attributed to over use of GABAB. As well Baclofen has a myriad of withdrawl effects similar to alcohol and Benzo withdrawl. These are also attributed to GABAB. Since it is an inhibitory neurotransmitter metabotropic and has an usually low hyperpolarization value ? Or something this is what Im betting is the cause of its potentially severe withdrawl symptoms people have reported.Baclofen is not as effective orally as Phenibut and is excreted unchanged. Phenibut is less potent per dose but does achieve higher levels within the brain than Baclofen. Also when comparing the two I think it is important to note the dosage differences used. Im referring to the dose of Phenibut that is manufactured in Russia vs. the doses many individuals that experience these side effects are using. Similarly if we were to look at Baclofen and take doses much higher than what they typically prescribe or what they are proposing for alcohol withdrawl treatment s of mg we may see a number of similarities that we do not see currently. In the article they do speak about the problematic effects being most common in intrathecal administration and also that this is the only route where some dependenceaddiction issues are more frequently seen.Sorry for dragging the thread a little offtrack. I just wanted to clear up the confusion. Lastly when I said that people take higher doses than prescribed Im not at all saying that the Phenibut doses people take are irresponsible rather to compare Baclofen the doses would need to be supratherapeutic.,Nootropics,coypgdx,1,t5_2r81c

Simple constipation can cause a feeling of depression bowel problems as a result of inactivity and bad posture can most certainly absolutely cause prolonged feelings of depression. The resulting depression could certainly cause some people to eat less resulting in malnourishment. With the proper stretching it is indeed possible to get almost immediate and astonishing levels of relief the exercises are relatively simple and its certainly possible in the age of the internet for someone to stumble across a combination of stretches massage and rehabilitation exercises to make an immediate and incredible difference. That being said it will require focus dedication and daily rehab to get prolonged and sustainable results.I think OP should carry on his path to healthier living if he is unable to sustain a healthy lifestyle and falls back into depression then I would agree that he should seek outside help. Frankly I think that while most professionals would recommend physical activity they may be quick to medicate.

3398696,0,t1_cpfmbyk,I believe this is itSo essentially this author suggests that oscillation between high and low acetylcholine states during sleep as one transitions between slowwave sleep and REM sleep are required for memory consolidation through a process of transferring information between the shortterm hippocampal memory banks to the long term cortical memory banks.My concern with AlphaGPC or CDP late at night would be the artificial sustained elevation of acetylcholine in the hippocampus during slowwave sleep which would theoretically lead to a reduced ability to return information to the cortical longterm memory storage from the hippocampus.  Based on additional discussion in this article this may effect declarative memory more than procedural memory so basically your rote facts memorized in short term during that day ie. new vocabulary trivia the recall simple events etc.  However the author also concedes this may extend to all forms of memory including complex declarative and procedural.Further this makes me curious if an anticholinergic like benedryl might improve declarative memory?  However since REM still depends on high cholinergic signalling and complex memory consolidation apparently relies on REM this would be a tricky balance dose to hit and not overshoot.,Nootropics,cpfoean,1,t5_2r81c

3488952,0,t3_307tau,Several years back as my life partner was onagain offagain with vaping he had been prescribed nicotine patches which were causing a rash. I also looked into nicorette gum but did not like what I was turning up in regards to many people reporting dental problems. I myself rarely vape having never been a smoker. Sometimes its nice because I enjoy the experience of trying different flavors and it does seem to distract me away from nervous snacking. I can say if I vape a lot for me that I get a headache that is short lived because I stop vaping has not happened in a long time. When I would regularly have caffeine late into the night and would vape some to try out new flavors I would have a hard time sleeping at night whereas my caffeine input was high enough that it would rarely cause problems.Now that I am caffeine free I recently had to bottle some DIY vape juice in a variety of nicotine levels. It would get on my hand and most of the time I would immediately wash it off but sometimes washing my hands would have to wait a minute or two. I found that doing this activity in the afternoon would lead to me being awake later at night. So certainly transdermally eliquids work. I will occasionally also test flavors by putting the smallest dot on my hand and licking it. I have seen this recommended to others previously who had lost their vapestick or ran out of batteries and were going through nicotine withdrawals.For me nicotine feels like a cleaner more effective stimulant than caffeine. It feels smoother going up and I dont have a case of the cranky irritation coming down. I dont actively seek it out but unless I mess with it late enough to push back my sleep schedule I find the effects enjoyable while I would not say the effects were subtle they did not feel as jagged and in my face as caffeine.I also found that it paired very nicely with tianeptine. note Ive written several times about my problems with starting tianeptine. The problem was that I was not drinking enough water even though I was drinking more water daily than I had in a couple of months. This has smoothed out so long as I try to follow the pounds weight x ounces e.g. lb personoz waterp.s. nicotine does not seem to have any effect on cold feet. keto diet seems to positively affect that though.,Nootropics,cppyruw,2,t5_2r81c

3606553,1,t1_cq3cmnh,Yeah...if you consider neurogenesis in the striatum to be conducive to anything more than paranoia. I dont believe they promote neuronal growth in areas that improve cognition and if they do I would argue that the benefit is cancelled out by the growth in the limbic system which growth just makes you go for instant gratification.Lets take adderall as an example do people learn how to be productive while on adderall in a natural sense? No once the drug is gone theyre at lesser place than they were at before they even took adderall. In essence they totally rely on the drug for cognition and the lack of cognitive ability when the drug is withdrawn speaks to its lack of improving neural plasticity.The definition is loose  its not really an officially sanctioned word.

3699798,0,t3_32ehwv,Hey this is the older brother that my younger bro posted for. I was experiencing the full blown psychosis. Im just now getting around to being able to walk and function on my own without extreme difficulty in breathing or rapid heart palpitations. I just wanted to thank Some of you on reddit for your suggestions but I can tell you I really thought at the time that the AFA Amfonelic Acid was helping me feel clear headed and I wasnt intending to abuse it I just notices that it was really finicky as far as when it worked or not and at what dose. Sometimes I could take mg and it would work other times I could take  and It wouldnt or so I thought. I cut myself off of every medication and nootropic I was on after the family noticed me acting strange. In hindsight of course always  I should NOT have been cut off of phenibut tianeptine Zoloft or Klonopin from the amount I was taking to nothing. I am almost  sure that such an abrupt stop shocked my system and caused what was already forming to be psychosis into .... Idk super psychosis. I will say I am thinking of going to get the genetic test done just to see if tassadarbot might be right. I extensively studied the effects of all the nootropics along with AFA which is NOT A NOOTROPIC though at the time I thought it was in trials on Pubmed and all over the internet. My advise it for NOONE to touch AFA due to its instability and inconsistent dosing. Its been nearly   days and Im still having trouble sleeping and found out my body was still withdrawing from Phenibut and Tianeptine so Ive started using Very VERY low doses of both but only as the WD effects start to interfere with my every day living. Let me know by voting or commenting if anyone wants to hear the story of exactly what I had though was going on in my head and about the alternate reality of hell that I lived in for a while.

3818012,0,t1_cqr6uo4,Semax is known to cause increased expression of BDNF or brainderived neurotrophic factor in animal studies. This protein encourages nerve growth and has various roles in synapse transmission and signal relaying. While the mechanisms of this arent well understood and havent been conclusively demonstrated in humans it is possible that the semax may be responsible for some improvement in working memory as well as recollection. Much of the research into semax is limited to a small number of research groups in Russia at the Institute of Molecular Genetics at the Russian Academy of the Sciences which understand it was recently made a property of the state and is having issues with funding and going through many budgetary and faculty cuts. Another thing to consider especially if youve relatively recently reduced or stopped your cannabis use is that use of cannabis causes causes neurological depression in endocannabinoid pathways associated with synaptic formation. Its important to note here that neurological depression refers to the downregulation or desensitization of receptors in the brain which means they require increased chemical stimulation to function normally. This is not synonymous with or related to the depression referred to in mood disorders. This downregulation can impair short term memory and the ability to form new synaptic connections. However it is temporary contingent on use. Cessation and reduction of cannabis use sees these pathways return to normal levels of activity. So it may be the semax it may be a change in your drug use or a combination of both could also be a change in mental or emotional circumstances as well behavior and mental function is never a simple thing to assign causeeffect relationships to. If I were still in contact with some of the researchers in my lab who worked on endocannabinoid and neurologically active peptides I could provide more information but the group who worked on these things has since changed universities and Ive shifted to a different department of study.I hope I was of some help or interest. ,Nootropics,cqrhfo3,3,t5_2r81c

I would guess that the closer somebody is to the research to the point of actually conducting studies and writing papers themselves the more theyd say we need more studies rather than speculating based on what we know so far about drugs mechanisms of action and pathways.There was a post here a few days ago that suggested that there might be some counterintuitive effects involved in how drugs interact with PTSD treatment.  Basically the gold standard treatment is exposure therapy in a safe environment with someone you trust just face up to the thing that triggers you and observe that the panic response as bad as it is comes and goes with time.  Some people get better from that more than with any other known treatment methodology but not everyone so researchers are looking for drugs to help.  The ones that do help seem to be those that help reinterpret or extinguish memories that arent useful to you anymore.  Anxiolytics might actually be counterproductive if they get in the way of recalling and interacting with your triggering memories.How all of this stuff interacts with epigenetics is way out past the current state of the research at least what Ive seen.  We know some of the epigenetic markers involved in human PTSD  but note how that article doesnt mention the three genes that showed statistically significant differences in expression in the article in the OP.  Im not an expert maybe theres some research that covers them but there might be some gaps to bridge.My wild ass guess is that if you think youre vulnerable to PTSD but havent actually had any triggering situations imprint themselves on you you might as well take some Ltheanine or drink some decaf tea.  Its so safe otherwise and lower baseline stress levels are so much a good thing for you and everyone around you that it almost seems dumb to me that more people dont take it.  ,Nootropics,cqvfgor,2,t5_2r81c
3852837,0,t1_cqs5v77,Its true some antioxidants in plants tea etc are actually very mild prooxidants such that they cause a hormetic effect to increase antioxidant capacity. What happens very often Ive read numerous studies on this is that many molecules in coffee broccoli tea so on actually upregulate our endogenous NRF production which is like a master gene controller for longevity and it upregulates the expression of a plethora of genes involved in antioxidation amongst other things improves proteostasis etc etc. This is where I doubt thered be much of a feasible limit on intake because its not impeding our natural antioxidant system as that is its MOA. And true about exercise. Though I feel that from what Ive read your endogenous system probably wouldnt be so heightened as to disrupt exercise benefits. Supplementing with a lot of exogenous antioxidants could however. Theres the distinction Id say. I mean exercise itself strongly upregulates these factors anyway in part due to the large burst of ROS production. I agree its pretty convoluted especially as to specific recommendations. I dont think theres an answer to that currently. I think most likely theres no real reason to avoid a high intake of fruits veggies etc just a generally healthy diet because they often work through our endogenous system. Same with exercise coffee and so on. Theres other ways to induce mitohormesis as well say transient bouts of cold like a short cold ass shower or even hot dry sauna use is starting to emerge as a great tool for healthlongevity. If youre doing these things that work via hormesis and upregulate our endogenous capacity its where I think supplementing with a lot of exogenous and unnecessary antioxidants would be a problem and probably have deleterious ramifications. However during old age for instance you wont have the same efficacious system and it may be worthwhile to ramp up antioxidant supplementation.Hope this helped any. ,Nootropics,cqvgiv6,5,t5_2r81c

I graduated ranked  in my college class from a top  school. One might think that alone would be enough to propel me into the upper echelon of my field and society. However the negatives outweigh the positives. My anxiety and depression are so crippling that even treated I have not and likely never will be able to take advantage of my gifts.

This means its hard to say anything concrete about the safety and health impact of all devices based on the research we do have.gt The major appeal of ecigarettes is that they dont contain tobacco and the exhaled vapor carries no harmful smoke tar or carbon monoxide. They also seem to have significantly fewer toxins and carcinogens than regular cigarettes.gt Bigger questions center on the toxicity of ecigarettes aerosol and liquids  and their potential longterm effects. Maciej Goniewicz of Roswell Park Cancer Institute is one of the leading researchers in this area. In one study he looked at  brands of ecigarettes and found that their vapors were mostly composed of nicotine and a nicotine solvent propylene glycol or vegetable glycerin. Also the levels of toxicants and carcinogens in ecigarette vapor were nine to  times less prevalent than in conventional cigarette smoke.gt Though propylene glycol and glycerin are generally considered safe substances not a lot is known about the longterm effects of daily inhalation Goniewicz says. Theres some evidence from theater settings  in which propylene glycol has been used to create fog  that suggests it can be a lung irritant. Goniewicz has also found toxic substances and cancercausing compounds such as formaldehyde and acetaldehyde in ecigarettes.Bolded some bits to save you some time.

4768041,0,t3_3g4nib,Yes of course. Cannabis is known to positively or negatively effect just about every psychoactive drug out there.From my personal experience Ive found it to typically cancel or reduce the effects of the few nootropics Ive tried though sometimes there is synergy in addition to the cancelling. For example a decent amount of modafinil with cannabis makes me feel less mentally hazy which in some regard lessens the high but in another sense results in a more clear high where I am still creative and stimulated but not couchlocked. Same goes for combining adderall or caffeine with cannabis. Just depends on what kind of effect youre looking for.I doubt you would encounter any damaging effects when taken in conjunction with those substances but it certainly could negate or lessen the effect of the substance. Everyone reacts differently so I would advise just giving it a try and making note of the results.My guess is youre really looking to see which of them create enjoyable combos though and for that Id have to defer to other commenters whove experiemented more.,Nootropics,ctvjztb,3,t5_2r81c

Gabat converts gaba to glutamate which is an excitatory neurotransmitterNT and a dirty one if not accompanied by the proper  NTs IMO.  Lemon balm is a strong inhibitor of gabat thus prevents the conversion of gaba to glutamate. Look into other gabats and try mixing gaba with the lemon balm sometime.

Bought some Kratom and Im telling you Kratom is VERY HELPFUL when going through Tianeptine withdrawal. I was able to quit cold turkey with Kratom a week later or so Kratom ran out and I was back to normal felt like I was never addicted to Tianeptine. If tapering doesnt work for you buy some Kratom. I did a lot of reading at rKratom and rKratomKorner and decided to try it and it works wonderfully. I experienced bad withdrawal first day because my Kratom was still on its way to my house felt like I had terrible flu anxiety attack every  minutes sweating diarrhea all day didnt want to eat or do anything but curl up in my bed then Kratom finally came next day and I pushed myself to cap these and took g of it nearly all withdrawal symptoms went away. The only one thing that was little annoying was that I couldnt still really sleep that well but I was able to function normally.Quitting Tianeptine with Kratom was so easy. Hope this helpsOh and Kratom is WAY less addictive than Tianeptine so youd be able to easily stop using Kratom after the withdrawal go away.,Nootropics,cud1rq8,-1,t5_2r81c

I was off work and had no idea how to cure this evil that had taken over my digestive tract.That until I switched to a ketogenic diet rketo is your friend.

Aspartame is extremely sweet so the quantity of phenylalanine produced is inconsequential unless you have congenital phenylketonuria. In that case the phenylalanine is toxic can cause permanent brain damage hence the need for labels.Also because phenylalanine is an essential nutrient tolerance and dependence dont really work the same way as for caffeine. The amino acids compete for absorption through the bloodbrain barrier so increasing the intake of phenylalanine without increasing the intake of other amino acids allows for more dopamine production but does not otherwise subvert your normal metabolism. ,Nootropics,cuprn01,2,t5_2r81c

5182850,0,t1_cva99x2,I am short for time today but the general gist is that noopept has a dose dependent curve that generally decreases when you have too much so you are probably not receiving the best effect you have even if you are getting some effect. See this graph which corresponds to the following quote taken from the first study below gt Oral administration of GVS produced an antiamnestic effect Fig.  a. The doseeffect relationship in a .. mgkg dose range was described by a bellshaped curve with a peak at . . mgkg. The anti amnestic effect disappeared at a dose of . mgkg and appeared again at higher doses. The second peak corresponded to  mgkg while at  mgkg the antiamnestic activity decreased. Therefore the dosedependence of GVS effect was described by a two peak curve.I would revisit your decision to take such a high dose especially for the longterm which noopept is usually great for. There are more papers but dont have time right now to post them...if you need more reassurance that mg is way too high of a dosing let me know but even the creator of noopept takes just  mg per day in divided doses.ProlineContaining Dipeptide GVS Retains Nootropic Activity after Oral Administrationgt There are data that dipeptides are more resistant to intestinal brush border enzymes compared to peptides with a more complex structure . The presence of cyclic amino acid proline and stabilizing substitutions at N and Cterminals may increase GVS resistance to these enzymes. The results of the present study confirm this assumption. Our data are in line with the data of pharmacokinetic studies showing that GVS after oral administration is rapidly absorbed and enters systemic and cerebral circulation and that its concentration in the brain far exceeds its plasma concentration . This attests to neurotropism and high bioavailability of GVS. Oral GVS in single and subchronic administration was effective not only in passive avoidance test common for the screening procedure but also in our version of active avoidance training. In this situation GVS stimulated memory consolidation and promoted attaining of learning criterion in poor learner animals.Pharmacokinetics of New Nootropic Acylprolyldipeptide and ItsPenetration across the BloodBrainBarrier after Oral Administrationgt GVS rapidly permeated BBB. Its brain and plasma kinetics were very similar brain concentration of GVS also peaked after  min but its content was higher than in the plasma Fig. . The brainplasma ratio exceeded  at all terms after attaining the peak concentration which attests to high tropism of the peptide to the brain tissue and its high specific bioavailability. The permeation of unchanged GVS into the brain after oral administration can be due to high lipophilicity of this molecule. Dipeptide permeation across BBB can be predicted by its lipophilicity. At the same time active transport of GVS across BBB membranes cannot be excluded.,Nootropics,cvaq1o6,6,t5_2r81c

5229551,0,t1_cvgbpyr,gt And also of course introversion has to do confidence the confidence to be on your own and enjoy your own company.I dont really agree. The difference between introversion and extroversion in my opinion is how youre affected by interaction with other people and not so much your attitude toward it including stuff like confidence levels.For an introvert dealing with people drains energy. It seems like the opposite is the case for extroverts theyre energized by social interaction not tired out by it. So regardless of confidence levels an introvert is going to need rest and solitude to regenerate after dealing with people.gt I think a nicer way of saying this would be that if you want to be extroverted then you arent really introverted you have an anxiety problem.Sorry but I dont agree with this either. There are definitely benefits to being an extrovert so someone thats introverted might desire those benefits without having any anxiety or confidence issues in play. Im sure there are also situations where an extrovert might desire to be more introverted  for example if for whatever they cant get the level of social interaction that makes them happy.

But there was a scare a few years ago because a study tested its carcinogenicity in ratsit encouraged multiple cancers even in the lowest dose tested.Theres conflicting information about itand lots of people with a vested interest in the drug will angrily make the claim that the doses tested were unrealistically high and that mice are too different from humans to draw comparisons.But interestingly there are actually other studies which find that PPARdelta agonists inhibit cancer. Heres a review article on it Either way IMO its too controversial to be worth the risk. But GW is more along the lines of dinitrophenol and other shit like that. It upregulates glucose uptake by mitochondrion.Androgens generally speaking dont contribute to cancer risks except prostate cancer. But the medical community has slowly come to realize that people generally die with prostate cancer rather than from it. When it comes to these compounds I would be most concerned about hepatoxicity.

And I get serious endorphins from it too almost opiatelike  during the workout after the workout randomly during the day. Its like a feelgood drug without any negative side effects. I look better. People notice and seem to act more interested in me now than they did before and I get more attention from women Im a straight dude so this is nice. Im happier with what I see in the mirror every morning and Im excited about how that will change as time passes. Im more physically capable. Work chores sports.. any physical activity is less of a nuisance and more of a fun challenge to me now. Increased power to exert your will over the laws of physics is great. I sleep better and get sick less often. And Im just happier and more confident this ones kinda a result of all of the above I think.

5397589,0,t1_cw1izii,Q.  I dont really notice the effects of racetams.  I take them long term for the brain protective and enhancement effects.  I think a lot of people are missing out on the benefits of these because they are looking for short term noticeable effects when the benefits are really subtle long term ones.Aniracetam is the only one among the main three piracetam oxiracetam aniracetam which is classified as an ampakine and its considered a weak one.  Even if there was reason for exitotoxicity concern with it which I strongly believe there is not  those concerns would not exist with the other two.  Oxiracetam has given me a profound feeling of comfort and relaxation when I started using it after a year or so of speed use without it but thats about the only short term acute effect I can relate to a racetam.Long term though I do credit them for enhanced perception memory dream recall verbal fluency executive function coordination and general resilience.Q.  Pretty much always mg of oxiani and mg piracetam.  Ive played around with mg oxiani and up to mg piracetam but havent noticed much difference.Q.  No but I have always taken them with alphagpc and I always recommend taking it with them.  Additionally I like to include good choline sources like eggs in my diet.  Regarding inconsistency of effect I believe piracetam and aniracetam are fat soluble while oxiracetam is water soluble.  If you dont take the fat soluble ones with a fatty meal youre going to get inconsistent absorption.Q.  All I know about Bacopa Monnieri is that it helps with neuroprotection memory and the serotonin system.  Its such an important herb in Ayurvedic medicine that infants were traditionally anointed on the head with it at birth to promote intellectual capacity not that such a thing would likely have any real effect its just a symbolic representation of how important the herb became culturally due to its medicinal benefits.The primary anecdote I have about this herb is from a friend whose grandmother died of brain cancer.  She told me that during her grandmothers final period of mental decline the grandmother was given Bacopi Monnieri and it had remarkable effects on her lucidity and memory allowing her to converse and function for while far beyond what she had been capable of without it.Q. I think its best in combination with the other racetams.Q. I take them all once at lunchtime but DebonaireDeaths suggestion of early was a good one.  That way you can play around with taking a second dose at lunch to see if it works for you.  Twice your current dosage is not at all dangerous but split between your first two meals of the day makes sense.  If you take it twice consider a second choline supplementation as well.Q.  Well some people justifiably think this rat race of piling on as many supplements as you can is a fools quest but I think youre definitely going about it the right way being careful to add one at a time and observe the results.   Keep in mind though that some of the things you liked but found to have undesirable side effects may actually become useful if combined with something else that cancels the side effects.  For example you may find that the ltheanine makes the ltyrosine more manageable in combination.  Adaptogens are great for this I recommend taking all of them in low doses all the time they can really keep your system balanced in remarkable ways.  The fish oils magnesium calcium and b vitamins are other things that should be generally supplemented but dont go crazy with the dosages because for example the b vitamins are cofactors in all sorts of enzymatic processes related to metabolizing all sorts of things magnesium deficiency is implicated in several neurological issues and fish oil helps with all sorts of nervous system inflammation related cases etc etc.  You really dont have to worry about combining reasonable amounts these things with any thing else theyre going to be good all around.I would note that much of my advice may be less helpful for you as Im almost certainly not genetically ADHD.  You can see the difference in your mention of how your symptoms manifest weeks after quitting whereas mine ended after weeks of quitting.  If you do have the right kind of genetic mutation related ADHD fasoracetam alone might be sufficient in your case.  Its way newer than the others and still carries a highrisk tag around here however its currently in Phase II or III trials for ADHD treatment.  There are people here and on longecity that swear by it for ADHD improvement.Regarding the phenylethylamine I believe it works at higher brain centers which regulate dopaminergic systems cant cite any sources though whereas Ltyrosine is a precursor of dopamine.  Once youve experimented with PEA I would suggest trying the ltyrosine in combination with it although maybe starting with half as much ltyrosine.A decade ago many of the substances talked about on this forum were unknown or nearly impossible to find.  You had to trawl through some crazy forums just to have a chance at learning the tiniest bit of what is discussed openly here today.  The most important thing I ever learned during that period was told to me by a genius steroid freak in response to my incessant questioning.  Basically he said to always remember that none of these substances are the end goal.  They are meant to be used to facilitate the development of useful habits and behaviors to help train intelligence just like bodybuilders use supplements to help train their muscles.  None of these nootropics will make you one tiny bit smarter by themselves.Finally regardless of future challenges no matter how bleak things may look at any moment you should be proud of yourself for taking personal agency in your own self improvement and quality of life.  Thats already more than many people can manage.  Exerting attention can be literally painful people generally try to get away with the minimum they can.  Always push a little harder dig a little deeper and dont accept the easiest answer for anything.  Devote yourself to relentlessly keeping that up as a habit and some day you will find yourself far more capable in many ways than the norm.  Just dont forget to devote a modicum of effort to helping others do the same.PS  Dont mind my name Im just rabidly antichristian.,Nootropics,cw1lo83,1,t5_2r81c

Then on nights when I work I abstain. On nights when I do use it I feel like I have less tolerance and on the  nights off I definitely feel that my overall mood composure and baseline is still improved. In fact I entertain a vague hope that after a while of doing this I might just make some permanent positive changes to my brain that will last well after any Moda use stops.

5801354,0,t1_cxf79e5,Not quite. It differs quite a bit based on ph. The acidic molecule in an acidic environment stomach renders it largely unionized allowing it to be absorbed. The majority of absorption typically happens in the small intestine sure but thats only due to such a large surface area. Thats only one facet and plenty of drugs are largely absorbed from the stomach contingent on ionization state. Lol it would make it more stressful though? Please. That would inhibit its absorption outright goodluck having adequate absorption when in an ionized state. As the start of the duodenum still has an acidic ph that becomes increasingly alkalized Id imagine a large portion of the absorption also happens there at the most proximal aspect. But increasing acidity of the stomach would also absolutely augment absorption by decreasing the ionized form of the drug. As for the coffee diuretic thing eh its a quasidiuretic at best and doesnt work like youre suggesting. At best coffee dilates afferent arterioles to the nephron which will thereby increase GFR and thus induce mild diuresis. This effect is largely attenuated in chronic users however. Further again HCl secretions would happen because of the coffee which directly stimulates its secretion as do other things. ,Nootropics,cxg7oim,1,t5_2r81c

There was a joke that went something like it really helps improve my memory when I remember to take it. Basically though Piracetam and Oxiracetam worked for some Aniracetam and Pramiracetam worked for others. Lucky individuals got effects from both. Ime its a little more complicated than that with varying effects from each. The fat soluble racetams are more subtle. I didnt notice Aniracetams effects until I compared writing samples from it and control. For a few years I used it when I needed to arbitrarily expand my perspective in situations that called for such a thing. Pramiracetam had excellent visual recall for things I wasnt trying to remember. It was like a daydream enhancer with the side effect of emotional numbing.

Longterm use of LDopa in Parkinsons patients and thus likely mucuna usage can cause motor symptoms. Unfortunately LDopa is subideal without carbidopa. Its worth noting that in at least one small study mucuna performed favourably compared to ldopa even though LD was paired with carbidopa so its likely worth looking at.Sadly Parkinsons is a complex disorder that we dont really understand. We dont even know if Parkinsons itself is an actual true disorder in the sense that it may theoretically be the result of any number of given things. Neurogenics antioxidants and antiinflammatories may all theoretically hold promise in the prevention of Parkinsons but are likely of limited usage for those who already suffer from it. Furthermore test results in the more typical medications ie piracetam have generally found no good results.

In a living person there are a lot of messy factors like whether the two substances have different absorption and excretion rates meaning they wouldnt always be present in the liver at the same time. You also probably want to know what dose of the protective substance is needed to be clinically effective otherwise you dont know if youre reducing your risk of liver failure by  or .For that reason I think a lot of protective substances really just give a false sense of safetyconfidence.

6398588,0,t1_czf5eem,Ive given up on fad diets or diet theories. The reason is that the variance in responses is likely very explainable by genetics In the end the space of exploration for these different diets is quite limited vegetabletomeatratio and viceversa fattocarbtoprotein ratio and vv and caloric intake. Plus the subtraction of all nasty foods which are by common sense pretty bad for you or otherwise harm you through an undiagnosed allergy.If those are the three systems in play then you dont really have to theorize too much about what it is you should be doing. So assuming you know your target basal metabolic rate and thus your calorie count youre exploring  x !   possibilities. Meaning that if you were to try everything once for about  months youd figure out your most optimal diet in a couple of years. One year if you want to be hasty and have ready access to your bloods.The benefit of fad diets is that they reduce the possibilities to  possibilities VeganVegetarian Mediterranean Paleo KetoAtkins and whatever it is youre generally doing right now which is typically crap or else you wouldnt be switching your diet. But the state of nutritional knowledge is so poor and selfcontradictory that youre almost better off tinkering knowledgewise.The only concession Id make is that a lot of people have already tinkered for you and if youre anything like those people then it will also work for you and youd find out with less effort. But real theories arent important for that just fake ones.EDIT In case its not clear Im using the royal you.

6409469,0,t1_czhg3l6,Thats a source of continuing work.  Theres value in it.  I happen to think theres more value in rational drug design because of how few uncharacterized species are left in the wild.  Rational drug design starts from the desired physiological response identifies a receptor or several receptors to evoke the response and then uses largebatch testing computer simulation and careful consideration of the interaction between the drug and the receptor to identify substances that would work.And youre actually wrong.  The reason we have so many studies on manmade molecules is because in order to bring them into the market companies must demonstrate to regulatory agencies a higher degree of safety and consistency than would be expected of a natural source.  Sure the end goal of a largescale pharma initiative is to make money but the end result is compounds that are held to an unbelievably higher standard than a natural supplement.  Just because the goal of the pharmaceutical company behind the drug campaign is to make money doesnt mean that the studies are all faked or somehow suspect.  Thats why we have at least in the US independent regulators that are mandated to control the drug development process for the public interest.I think you are correct in that there is value in searching for asofyet undiscovered species in the hope that they contain new compounds.   As someone with knowledge of the drug development process and the effectiveness of RDD I can confidently say you are overestimating how useful natural products are as lead compounds in the process.  That period in scientific history is essentially over love.,Nootropics,czi6x79,1,t5_2r81c
6413622,0,t3_43hxni,Look up opiates. Their main mechanism for depression is thought to be from neural plasticity and hyper learning. I think even opiates are good for intelligence. I think most drugs are though. Any novel drug that you havent become familiar with will induce learning states. Have you heard how listening to some specific song while studying then playing it while taking test makes it easier to remember? Drugs are like this too. Our lives can often be too familiarized which makes us stuck on autopilot. Many of these drugs can snap us out of the fog. It is my opinion that being conscious during an activity makes you more capable of finding new ways of doing stuff. Whereas autopilot helps you easily do repetitious behavior. But I think its not the repetitious behavior that we struggle with. So I think acetylcholinergic drugs help you become repetitious faster. Essentially learning a specific thing. But anticholinergic drugs can induce a novelty mode where you become conscious and deeply aware of an activity your doing. I think when people have difficulty doing stuff on anticholinergics its because they cant do stuff on autopilot. Its benefits are probably dose dependent.  Use just enough to stop autopilot and allow a creative and conscious state. Not too much tho. Have you ever done painting? And then you become so familiar to the painting that you feel blind to it? So you need to stop working for a while in order to have more objectivity again. This could apply to any work. I think cholinergics induce the familiarity and make it difficult to move forward. But then anticholinergics Ive found I can work without my abilities declining. They block memory sort of. But also recall or maybe only recall. Sorry for the rant. But I think there is a lot of facts that are overlooked here. ,Nootropics,czinwta,2,t5_2r81c

NOOTROPICS are much too weak for ADHD even modafinil barely works for it .I will repeat my other advice nootropics are too weak for ADHD adhd is too severe. It doubles your mortality rate for fucks sake.By adolescence these chronic and cumulative experiences with school failure learning disorders school misbehavior and sometimes lower intelligence begin to generate other adverse educational outcomes. For instance the academic outcome of the hyperactive ADHD adolescents was considerably poorer in Barkley and Fischers Milwaukee followup study at the teen followup than that of the typically developing adolescents followed concurrently. At least three times as many hyperactive ADHD children had failed a grade . vs. . or been suspended . vs. . or expelled . vs. . Fischer Barkley Edelbrock amp Smallish . Others have also identified such high educational risks in longitudinal studies dating back as much as  years Ackerman Dykman amp Peters  Mendelson Johnson amp Stewart  Stewart Mendelson amp Johnson  Weiss Minde Werry Douglas amp Nemeth  Wilson amp Marcotte . In another sample of clinicreferred teenagers with ADHD a similar risk for school retention and suspension was documented Barkley Anastopoulos Guevremont amp Fletcher . Almost  of the hyperactive sample followed into adolescence had quit school at this followup point in the Milwaukee Study compared to none of the normal sample Barkley Fischer et al. . Fischer and colleagues  also found that the levels of academic achievement on standard tests were significantly below normal on tests of math reading and spelling falling toward the lower end of the normal range standard scores between  and . These findings were reaffirmed  years later at the age  followup Barkley et al. . In the Canadian followup study approximately  attempted a college program yet only  completed a university degree program compared to over  of control children Weiss amp Hechtman . The longest running year followup study of hyperactive children into midlife likewise indicates that less education is an outcome of childhood ADHD with  either not completing high school or getting a general equivalency diploma GED compared to just  of the control group Klein et al. . These findings demonstrate that the educational domain is major in terms of impaired functioning and reduced attainment for children growing up with ADHD.Quoted from the th edition The mean is much higher for adhd vs controls remember its normally distributed so a mean that much higher is actually a severe consequence.I own almost all of Barkleys books and have poured through the literature glance through his fourth handbook. I will repeat once again.Why would you all downvote me if its that bad? Just take the meds I guess I dont feel too bad getting downvoted because this sub did upvote something that doubted the validity of a mental disorder that is extensively corroboratedover k studies done on it alone.

6746950,0,t1_d0h1g8q,GI isnt that relevant if you have a moderately active lifestyle and dont have preexisting metabolic issues which unfortunately covers a lot of Americans. For instance potatoes are high GI but contain fibres that are awesome for gut health. They are also very nutritous and delicious. Most people should ignore GI to the extent that it reinforces silly statements like refined doesnt make a difference. Fibre and nutrition content obviously make a difference. Among other things they indirectly regulate blood sugar and prevent crashes. ,Nootropics,d0h6w7g,2,t5_2r81c
6747017,1,t1_d0h6vaq,I would say so as NE is implicated in attention and motivation and has several functions in the pfc i havent fully studied it but ill keep this thread updated.one of the studies a quick search turned upNew perspectives on catecholaminergic regulation of executive circuits evidence for independent modulation of prefrontal functions by midbrain dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurons.Chandler DJ Waterhouse BD Gao WJ.Author informationAbstractCognitive functions associated with prefrontal cortex PFC such as working memory and attention are strongly influenced by catecholamine dopamine DA and norepinephrine NE release. Midbrain dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area and noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus are major sources of DA and NE to the PFC. It is traditionally believed that DA and NE neurons are homogeneous with highly divergent axons innervating multiple terminal fields and once released DA and NE individually or complementarily modulate the prefrontal functions and other brain regions. However recent studies indicate that both DA and NE neurons in the mammalian brain are heterogeneous with a great degree of diversity including their developmental lineages molecular phenotypes projection targets afferent inputs synaptic connectivity physiological properties and behavioral functions. These diverse characteristics could potentially endow DA and NE neurons with distinct roles in executive function and alterations in their responses to genetic and epigenetic risk factors during development may contribute to distinct phenotypic and functional changes in disease states. In this review of recent literature we discuss how these advances in DA and NE neurons change our thinking of catecholamine influences in cognitive functions in the brain especially functions related to PFC. We review how the projectiontarget specific populations of neurons in these two systems execute their functions in both normal and abnormal conditions. Additionally we explore what open questions remain and suggest where future research needs to move in order to provide a novel insight into the cause of neuropsychiatric disorders related to DA and NE systems.with regards to cafeine ill look info studies look this and post more when i know moreAdenosine caffeine and performance from cognitive neuroscience of sleep to sleep pharmacogenetics.Urry E Landolt HP.Author informationAbstractAn intricate interplay between circadian and sleepwake homeostatic processes regulate cognitive performance on specific tasks and individual differences in circadian preference and sleep pressure may contribute to individual differences in distinct neurocognitive functions. Attentional performance appears to be particularly sensitive to time of day modulations and the effects of sleep deprivation. Consistent with the notion that the neuromodulator adenosine  plays an important role in regulating sleep pressure pharmacologic and genetic data in animals and humans demonstrate that differences in adenosinergic tone affect sleepiness arousal and vigilant attention in rested and sleepdeprived states. Caffeinethe most often consumed stimulant in the worldblocks adenosine receptors and normally attenuates the consequences of sleep deprivation on arousal vigilance and attention. Nevertheless caffeine cannot substitute for sleep and is virtually ineffective in mitigating the impact of severe sleep loss on higherorder cognitive functions. Thus the available evidence suggests that adenosinergic mechanisms in particular adenosine AA receptormediated signal transduction contribute to wakinginduced impairments of attentional processes whereas additional mechanisms must be involved in higherorder cognitive consequences of sleep deprivation. Future investigations should further clarify the exact types of cognitive processes affected by inappropriate sleep. This research will aid in the quest to better understand the role of different brain systems e.g. adenosine and adenosine receptors in regulating sleep and sleeprelated subjective state and cognitive processes. Furthermore it will provide more detail on the underlying mechanisms of the detrimental effects of extended wakefulness as well as lead to the development of effective evidencebased countermeasures against the health consequences of circadian misalignment and chronic sleep restriction.,Nootropics,d0h7565,0,t5_2r81c
6752012,0,t1_d0c7giz,For the purpose of devils advocate No stealing as a lone moral rule is fairly non comprehensive.

I can see how one might think of murder as stealing someones life but does intentionally breaking a dogs leg steal anything from anyone? no and saying it steals the dogs ability to walk isnt valid.

6896058,1,t3_4a1oq2,I understand PCs decision to remove tian .. they dont want to get introuble with something like that because of the programming in our society... DONT Keep escalating doses of drugs to higher and higher and higher!!! Stick with the proper dose and whatever it does it does...Someone said its a shame I am being downvoted  let me respond and tell you why I am being downvoted  because the natural Wellbeing feeling that millions of people get if they have the lucky genes for it is matched by someone with bad genes taking tianeptine hardly a high  The person who said tian feels like a weaker version of tramadol is a wise person who is not overstating tian pretending tian is some sort of recreational agent that gets people highPlease tell me if Tianeptine gets you high describe to me what hallucinations you had or how many times you laughed hysterically at something that isnt that funny  or how slurred your speech is as you are smiling and talking in incoherent sentences. Because those are examples of what a High is. Give me a break when a person with depression amp anxiety takes tianeptine they are STILL feeling worse than a healthy person on no drug so how the fuck is that a high or recreational?Oh and if someone happens to be unwise and take a little extra tianeptine so they end up in bed and meditate extrawell kind of in a hypnotic state thats still not a big deal because other people do that naturally without any drugs. Also what the hell is someone supposed to do if they were born with a dysfunction of the Mu and AMPA pathways of the brain?? are they supposed to suffer until their death because you people are programmed to think medicines are socalled recreational or get you high? I mean an SSRI SNRI Benzo or dozens of other classes isnt going to treat a person who has sluggish endorphin transmission because the phosphorylation of their mGluR is in dysfunction  they will simply suffer to until their deathSo you can make fun of be for appearing to be neurotic because I use phrases like SatanicDisinfo but are my phrases really idiosyncratic and eccentric? Satanic is not just a spiritual thing its also a generic adjective meaning selfserving sociopath because that is the philosophy of satanists. So Ive adopted it as a nonreligious generic adjective and im not actually referring to actual satanists.Ever see someone who was raped repeatedly as a child? That person has psychological damage but they still drive cars go to work at jobs go to school at a College hang out with friends laugh and talk. A person with very severe depression and anxiety is suffering farworse than this and cannot function to do these normal things taken for granted because their dysphoric setpoint state of consciousness is so bad it destroys their life and the ability to do these things. SO THEREFORE Is it not true then that Authoritarians who setpolicy to ban restrict and pressure away helpful meds are technically worse than childrapists? Yes they are worse than child rapists because  people with severe dysphoria suffer worse amp are far more damaged than those who have been raped.  the DarkAuthoritarian Sociopaths who set these policies affect millions of lives not just  or a few rape victimsTherefore it is logical to point out that DarkAuthoritarians that destroy HealthFreedom by setting antidrug policies are in fact worse than child rapists. To answer that other person further The reason why I am voted down is because stating the directtruth in regular wording to accurately describe things as they are instead of beating around the bush with extraweak wording makes people have PsychologicalDenial and Cognitive Dissonance that then gets them angry. People are very weakminded with watered down wording about every thing. They bend over to get it good from Authoritarians then talk about it as if its halfgood halfbad instead of the destruction of health freedomWith that said  its not good to become addicted to a substance and keep esculating your dose. Dont do that. Your supposed to taper up your dose a few times to an Ideal level then stay at that level foreverWhat we need in this society is to allow agents like tianeptine an unlimited supply of them and devolop agents that reduce the brains ability to get tolerant. You never get fully tolerant to most medicines. For example when i was prescribed by a doctor and took tramadol for  years i never got fully tolerant to it and my life was better on it than it was now. I cannot get tramadol anymore because satanic authoritarians have a LoveAffair pain amp Suffering and are ignorant to what dysphoria feels like because they never had it once in their life. And they influence doctors and make doctors refuse to write meds that help so that one suffers from birth to death.They do not care if other peoples lives are destroyed so long as its not their own life or their familys life that is destroyed its ok to set Authoritarian extremist policy and destroy other peoples Lives. Thats just fine to them. Theres no deterrent in place because there appears to be no such thing as karma or instant karma. If there was their own evil would be reversed back onto them and they would suffer from the the suffering they cause or perpetuate on others. Therefore they can get away with Authoritarianism by destroying health freedom and other freedoms so that life being already hard to begin with as a fragile physical being gets even harder with even more pain amp suffering. Start thinking about HealthFreedom and how alien Authoritarian is. Do you realize how insane our society is? Drugs are banned and then that banning is backed by deadly forced with automatic weapons and submachine guns. If a company made something controlled and sold it they would be met by deadly force to be brought to prision and torture and resistance would result in their immediate execution with automatic weapons and submachine guns. Does that not sound insane?Start pretending you were born yesterday and view things in a new light so that you get rid of what you take for granted and start using logic and stand for Light amp Ethics instead of Darkness amp Apathy.I apologize for using this thread to say all this i could have just as well said this in another thread. Ive always spoken like this when I have rarely posted anywhere. In otherwords Im not on any drug that is making my hypomanic or anything like that. ive always typed like this and this is what it looks like to type a post on an issue when you arent brainwashed and not using extraweak wording wateringdown everything. I will now leave this thread and discontinue my reddit posting until i feel like posting again which would probably be a year or so. I hardly ever post anywhere and lack the motive. Its difficult because I will get tons of negative psychopathic energy thrown at me due to being tooreal. Matter of fact when someone is real they look like satire sarcasm or trolling when they arent doing those things. Thats how used to being fake we have become that being real and using nonweak wording is now only done in sarcasmIm not a Person who escalates Tianeptine or other drugs to higher and higher doses endlessly. Im just defending HealthFreedom for those who take Low Medium High or Extra High doses of something no matter who they are. Please stop wording everything so weakly and start calling out this darkness amp evil that disallows people from getting mental help. The mainstream meds that are sactioned in Psychiatry are false meds that dont work only suggestible people who are well to begin with say they work. Those are people how naturally have a mix of constant hypoeuphoria and foul moods who say SSRIs and others work. No one with real actual dysphoria has ever gotten help from the meds they allow in psychiatry. They are forced to suffer or try to find alternatives while Satanists try to block them so they suffer torture from birth to death.,Nootropics,d0xzj5b,3,t5_2r81c

Ipidacrine is a legal fraud from doctors that try to treat elderly  dementia with combination of piracetam infusions vinpocetine wtf seriously ipidacrine and other medicines instead of doing a proper diagnosis and proper treatment trying out ginkgo memantine donepezil or their combinations in case of serious issues.I suppose you wouldnt like effects on smooth muscle because that most probably means issues with normal intestinal motility constipation or diarrhea at least maybe a slight desire to vomit.I wont advise any use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors of that class be it donepezil or ipidacrine or similar thing because their usage usually goes together with strict control procedures from doctor they counteract with many things in human body.There shouldnt be any profit from using acetylcholinesterase inhibitors for young or adult people because of ceiling effect though not without any choline transportation modulators like coluracetam or piracetam.,Nootropics,d1gk0zh,2,t5_2r81c

Locating one that is still operating would involve considerable time in the waiting room like all day before asking a trivial question from a overworked doctor who is most likely donating their time. And yes asking if mixing LTheanine and Adderall is trivial. That is why people come to rNootropics  to SHARE information. Chances are any doctor in the US that you would ask about LTheanine would give a generic warning since they most likely are not familiar enough with it to answer specifically. And Adderall and the other SSRI whatever it is are usually not incredibly expensive in the US if you have the sense to buy generic or belong to some sort of insurance group or medicaid. Not many people in the US pay full retail price for medications. But you did a Google search so you know.Telling someone rNootropics to talk with your doctor and acting like that should be the default response IS pompous. Of course talking to a doctor is usually beneficial. Although theres a lot of shitty doctors in the US with dubious foreign diplomas. Wait all day at a free clinic you may meet one.

Of course many factors may play a role in doing tests which measure very specific cognitive capacities that may be under or overdeveloped due to the individuals work and life and IQ is not the sole predictor of academic success as EEG plays an even greater role but that doesnt mean that IQ tests are not pretty good measures of intelligence.Besides that IQ scores are strongly correlated with academic success.

Looks like Im just going to have to suck up some cadmium lead and fluoride with my rubidium.Just a little cancer catatonic schizophrenia and depression Im sure Ill be fine. Not like Im freebasing hexavalent chromium or something like that. Ill probably not do this with tea bags again need to buy some higher quality tea like the large leaf mid grade stuff probably is the best for my purposes. Maybe g of tea a day rubidium accumulates if you eat nitrates apparently and I love my bacon.I can eat bacon without fearing of nitrosonornicotine being formed in my stomach now Im off nicotine.Side note nicotine is a major depressant as in induces major depression with chronic administration not as in its a major tranquilizerneuroleptic. It is also antinootropic but similar to how low doses of a psychdelic help psychosis in the long run by giving you a tolerance to psychosis you do have better task performance on nicotine because it gives you a tolerance to antinootropics so in the long run its regulating your brain towards nootropic more or less.But the problem is nicotine is really specific to  over   which really fucks over your whole limbic system.Selective ligands tend to have unpredictable effects these happen to fuck over reward other acetylcholine receptors are also targeted but its primarily at that specific acetylcholine receptor concentrated in portions of the basal ganglia. Its important not to confuse productivity enhancers with nootropics.Nootropics tend to be dodgy as fuck and barely drugs at all productivity enhancers are just moderatehard drugs with some sort of broad spectrum stimulatory effect.Stuff like somethingnsomethingbuproprion and hydroxynorketaminea nicotinic antagonists responsible for some of the parent drugs effect are both antidepressant and nootropicin the short term but antinootropic in the long term. Its really easy to kick start your brains nicotine system through starting up on a pretty good dose of one of these and cold turkey withdrawing from nicotine. You barely notice it if it completely shuts off rather then just partially being activated far below baseline its quite an odd phenomena.As long as you only have dependence on nicotine and not tobacconicotineharmala MAOIs buproprion or ketamineor rather their active metabolites snsbuproprion and hydroxynorketamine can kickstart your nicotine system and you just kinda go through a few weeks of restless legs and then boom no more nicotine. Again its key not to try and quit  drugs at once and tobbaco is multiple drugs.Its purported that the novel highly efficacious partial agonist at NDMA NRX is structurally homologous to hnK and possibly may be hnK itself.,Nootropics,d34meps,1,t5_2r81c

7667392,0,t1_d3dhf3q,Okay I think I get it.The heteroreceptor is activated by mediators from other neurons hence why its post synaptic. The autoreceptors is mediated by its own neurotransmitter release which undergoes a negative feedback loop when serotonin in this given example is released from the presynaptic neuron. Binding of serotonin to post synaptic neurons functions in a positive feedback loop activating the release of further neurotransmitters downstream from it yeah? So in a sense its all a negative feedback loop because the presynaptic neuron determines the level of activity of the post postsynaptic receptor...?

7729269,0,t1_d3kr46v,I imagine there is some sort of removal that happens over time but the major issue with the carbon nanoparticles is how long it takes for alveolar macrophages to remove it. In the process the particles seem to interfere with the proper maintenance of the elastin fibers that deflate the millions  of tiny balloons that make up your lungs preventing you from properly removing old air a.k.a. emphysema.So I think that yes Im probably not even at risk for emphysema. I should think that the degradative effects of the nanoparticles on elastin require a certain concentration level to exert complications for the bodys natural reparative  systems and the macrophage likely become overwhelmed by higher levels of nanoparticles because they take so long to remove.I dont know though.  Im certainly no expert in respiratory pathology but thats my take.This is more of my intuition speaking but I would also say that regular exercise would likely improve things significantly. Higher body temperature increases the metabolic rate of cells which would give the macrophages the boost they need  to help with any residual particles and the increased gas exchange and blood  flow in the lungs  will cycle surfactant moisture and solutes throughout the entire system expediting  the removal  of any debris  or toxins.,Nootropics,d3krhef,1,t5_2r81c

I suppose it depends on what youre using it for.Examine also has dose ranges for CDP Choline and things like Uridine monophosphate at MG but both of those are extremely effective for me at doses lower than MG.

8198296,1,t1_d527164,gtThis would be better off without the current issues thrown in...which trivialized the theory of emotional granularitygt I think emotional granularity would be far more applicable on a personal level... In comparison to the goingsons of the events in my own life Im extremely apathetic when it comes to the news I read and seegtObjectively seemingly unimportant events that impact you personally and immediately are what can evoke your full range of emotions with vast precision not some bullshit that you watched on the  Oclock news.How exactly did those examples trivialize the theory? They did no such thing. It seems that you lack empathy and have an embarrassingly narrow worldview so its no wonder that you are apathetic in the face of human suffering that goes on around the globe. Fortunately many people are not so selfinvolved and are able to take an emotional interest in the lives of others. For such people remote issues can be personal issues meriting serious concern. The fact that you have a stymied affective capacity does not entail that the rest of the world cant feel fully and vividly the impact of a problem occurring beyond the scope of their own small lives. Plus do you really think climate change and terrorism are bullshit? If you do I recommend with urgency that you educated yourself. These are phenomena with wideranging  or better yet global  ramifications that should inspire fear dread insecurity confusion and a whole raft of other emotions in everyone currently living  including you. The thought that events covered in the news are irrelevant to our own existence simply because they are geographically distant is so ignorant and so brainless that Im surprised anyone could espouse it with as much foolish confidence as you have.

8223716,0,t1_d549w76,Actually I would point out Machiavellians are often high achievers or at least many wealthy people are Machiavellian. Machiavellianism shares certain traits with psychopathy and is considered a member of the Dark Triad personalities along with narcissism and psychopathy.Its usually not enough to interfere with the persons life and often benefits it so it isnt diagnosed as a disorder though Im fairly certain it is recognized as a legitimate personality trait in psychology. The myth that psychopaths are good manipulators is sort of a distortion between its traits and Machiavellianisms traits. For example psychopaths can be callous about their treatment of others and more easily just use someone than another person but they often times have difficulties with actually understanding peoples feelings and this contributes to their callousness. Machiavellians have also been thought to possess heightened social skills of some sort but its usually shown that they dont but the means and motivations by which a Machiavellian seems to be driven to handle a situation often seems to bleed into the publics understandings of how a psychopath does though.Also err that last statement doesnt seem wise.,Nootropics,d55ir1t,2,t5_2r81c

NaB but not sodium formate was found to upregulate plasticityrelated molecules stimulate NMDA and AMPAsensitive calcium influx and increase of spine density in cultured hippocampal neurons. NaB induced the activation of CREB in hippocampal neurons via protein kinase A PKA which was responsible for the upregulation of plasticityrelated molecules. Finally spatial memory consolidationinduced activation of CREB and expression of different plasticityrelated molecules were less in the hippocampus of poor learning mice as compared to good learning ones. However oral treatment of cinnamon and NaB increased spatial memory consolidationinduced activation of CREB and expression of plasticityrelated molecules in the hippocampus of poorlearning mice and converted poor learners into good learners.

8422965,0,t3_4usgus,I would encourage you to continue experimenting with LTheanine. I personally never bothered with the capsules I went straight for bulk powder to save money I buy it from Liftmode theyve been extremely reliable for the  years Ive used them.So the recommendation is to not take more mgday but Ive found that taking somewhere between mgday works really well for my anxiety. I take mg in the morning with coffee mg when I get home from work and mg before bed. Ive been doing this regimen for over two years and can say that its given me my brain back.In the morning it helps reduce racing thoughts and worried about how the day may or may not go. It lasts through the morning and stops me from crashing from the coffee. Im able to speak more easily and look people in the eye at work without feeling uncomfortable. There are a lot of loud children at my job and it keeps me from becoming overstimulated. I also have to type a lot of notes for my job and with LTheanine I can really focus and hammer through them much faster.When I take the second dose in the afternoon it just helps me let go of the day and focus on being home and really engaging with my spouse have fun conversations cook clean grocery shop etc. I dont hang on to stressful things from earlier in the day. Its kind of like a mental lubricant.At night nothing helps me fall asleep like LTheanine. I take it I lay down within  minutes afterward and I just drift away into sleep. No more wandering mind no more anxious thoughts I dont think Oh no I forgot X and Y and Z today! I just fall asleep in about  minutes where it used to be  minutes to an hour of tossing and turning. I really suggest you keep experimenting with it I believe it will help you.TLDR My favorite nootropicsupplement Keep trying LTheanine bulk powder Try highermultiple doses  Consistent personal experience for  years includes     Greatly reduced anxiety     Prevents overstimulation      Improved focus     Improved sleep     No negative effects,Nootropics,d5ueuyq,2,t5_2r81c

But were most likely still having vivid dreams that we dont remember for more than a couple seconds after we wake up.

8650835,0,t1_d6mxoqc,Im not rude i just point out nonsense.You said that insulin creates fat cells when wiki doesnt say so.Absorbing triglicerydes from blood doesnt mean creating fat cells it clearly shows you dont understand what you talk about.Also article is from site that clearly sells keto related stuff and still this article doesnt use single science study to support its claims.Its just bullshit article without any value.I will give you clear example how wrong is your thinking  what will make you fat a.eating g of sugars dailyb.eating g of butter dailyExplain answer to me using your insulin theory.Science adapted long time ago and insulin theory was proven to be wrong long time ago.Dietary fat stimulates mTor path which is ultimate anabolic path insulin is just minor player here.You can gain fat without spiking insulin too muchAn enzyme called ASP Acylation Stimulating Protein. This little jewel has the ability to directly store fat in the fat cells completely bypassing the glucose and insulin pathways.On a zero carb diet excess fatty acids not immediately needed for energy will be directly stored in the fat cells through ASP. This stored fat will then be called upon as the body needs energy and is mobilized out of the fat cells through Hormone Sensitive Lipase HSL which will only allow body fat metabolism if insulin a hormone is low hence hormone sensitive.As long as the total fat stored is equal to the total fat consumed body fat will not accumulate. However if on average less energy is needed than was stored not all fat stored by ASP from the ZC meals will be remobilized by HSL and body fat will rise.BTW fat also impacts insulin resistance and considering that keto promotes eating a lot of saturated fats its bad newsOne point that you made is important without insulin its literally imposibble to build muscle because there arent any efficient pathways to stream aminoacids and glycogen to muscles except insulin.But there are efficient ways to build triglicerydes into fat cells withut insulin and people fail to know this.Also one more point insulin doesnt make glucose fat thats just plain bullshit.Glucose can be changed to fat by reaction called de novo lipogenesis but in humans its extremely rare,Nootropics,d6myu76,2,t5_2r81c

Please forgive me lol  Just skimmed over the list but it has the major ones BPA Polybrominated biphenyl ethers PBDEs  flame retardants Benzophenone and Methylbenzylidene camphor MBC  these are found in sunscreen lotion  I think sunscreen is unnecessary outside of early childhood and then theres other ones found in building supplies and pesticides. You probably wont have to worry about those unless youre in construction or agriculture but stuff like sunscreen and shitty plastic products are ones you can avoid.Im not hyperparanoid about that kind of stuff but I know that its in the environment. And I know that companies skirt the issue and fail to report things so its just another reason why I feel comfortable with HRT and not permitting myself to fall victim.I have a few savage kicks to the nut sac as a younger age too and combined with some medical issues I think I may have had a bit lower test levels to begin with.

I will happily upvote when you can give evidence that the FDA has rejected the mentioned EpiPen competitors due to actual corruption instead of vague allusion to unnamed conspiracies by partisan organizations outside the medical field.Edit Not to mention the sources your trash references explains why many things are. For examplegtEpiPen Adrenaclick Twinject and the authorized generic to Adrenaclick have an FDA Orange Book rating of BX indicating that insufficient evidence exists to determine therapeutic equivalence. This rating indicates that these epinephrine autoinjector products are not therapeutically equivalent to each other.For example the other products should not be substituted and dispensed when EpiPen AutoInjector is prescribed unless the prescriber is consulted and agrees to change the prescription.gtIn addition to the lack of therapeutic equivalence among epinephrine autoinjector products differences exist between the autoinjector devices appearance administration technique and dose verification Table. It is important to understand these differences as they may have important clinical implications for patients and their caregivers.Does a pretty good job of why the FDA has said that the various autoinjectors cant be switched out when the prescription is filled.

I was using a mood tracking app to track nootropics for mood and discovered that these minor issues actually affected my mood a lot more than I realized.  Ive run into many similar stories here as well.I also had very little luck getting medication for pain or allergies that didnt have side effects arguably worse than the actual issues and that didnt treat the root cause only the symptoms.

8861462,0,t1_d7ctl6v,Yeah.  Most drugs are extremely cheap to manufacture exceptions can include large complex molecules like antibodies when manufactured on a large scale.  Consequently generic OTC drugs tend to be extremely cheap.  For example you can get  pills of ibuprofen for .  As a rule high drug prices indicate that some law or regulation prevents competition.  The patent system does this but patents are the carrot on the end of a stick.  The possibility of a patent or exclusivity induces pharmaceutical companies to invest the billions of dollars necessary to bring a drug through the onerous FDA approval process.  The problem is when laws and regulation bar competition for drugs that were developed a long time ago.  There is no reason for consumers to pay  times the cost for Colchicine when doctors have been prescribing colchicine for millenia.  We know what it does and we know what its side effects are whether or not theres been an official government FDA trial. It is not in the publics best interest for the FDA to an exclusivity agreement to a company for testing colchicine.  That the FDA would grant such an exclusivity agreement tells me that FDA has grown deeply dysfunctional. ,Nootropics,d7d0u46,2,t5_2r81c

8946488,0,t3_52tjda,I definitely wouldnt recommend klonopin as a regular appetite stimulant as benzodiazepines have a high risk of dependency and tend to make people too sleepy to work out but heres some other ideas.Are you taking ADHD medication? Those can really make your appetite disappear. If I were you I would first consider talking to your doctor about slightly decreasing any ADHD meds that might be interfering with your appetite small change not stopping completely as that may increase ADHD symptoms and focusing on eating calorie and nutrient dense meals peanut butter banana and whole milk shakes olive oil over sauteed vegetables with your meals a whole avocado cut up over a salad. Things that are healthy but also rich in calories. Do you use tobacco or lots of caffeine? The evidence for caffeine is mixed but smoking cigarettes can definitely interfere with normal appetite. If its legal in your state you could also try a marijuana strain that can help stimulate appetite in the afternoonevening once you finish your ADLs such as Girl Scout Cookies or Pineapple Kush. Lastly mirtazepine is an antidepressant used for people whos depression interferes with appetite but it will also probably make you sleepy and thats a pretty big gun for your problem something to talk to your doctor about if other options fail. Good luck with your bulk stay healthy hope I could help. ,Nootropics,d7n8i13,2,t5_2r81c

8991116,0,t3_52i9n5,This has got to be the first place Ive ever seen such widespread acceptance of the idea that psychedelics belong beneath the nootropic umbrella.  Dont get me wrong LSD and DMT have taught me far more about myself the world and how the former relates to the latter than any classic nootropic Ive ever taken and it seems as though thats how most here interpreted the question. Ill be the first to admit that those experiences have had a far more profound impact on my life than any cognitive or mood improvements I have realized from use of any actual nootropics. But I have a very hard time classifying LSD shrooms DMT mescaline MDMA or any of the other substances that are being tossed around here as nootropics.  If I stay within the scope of the OPs question Id have to say noopept and its not even close. Within a few days I had noticed marked improvements in verbal fluency and recall that have persisted well beyond continued daily use. I dont know if it actually improved cognitive function above my theoretical baseline or whether it simply helped to reverse some of the damage that I had inflicted through recklessness and stupidity in my younger days. Either way though noopept was a godsend for me.  ,Nootropics,d7sldsu,1,t5_2r81c

Its a been over a year and my mood is more stable now also was diagnosed with lyme disease so I have experience severe brain fog and anxiety. Nicotine off and on has been helpful to me. I have have also noticed a lot of benefit from using the following medications and they dont just apply to people who are diagnosed with lyme but many people experience benefits from these supplements I guess you would call them. That would include Ginko Biloba LDN and CBD or cannibis oil with  CBDTHC ratio or higher CBD but CBD alone is fine as well depending on the person. LDN is an interesting one. It temporarily blocks your opiate receptors and once its gone it helps to re balance your endogenous opioid activity which plays a role in your overall mood.

9535746,0,t3_5bgs1m,Absolutely. I got a andme test back on friday and Ive spent most of my weekend coming through all the data and getting it analyzed through nutrahacker livewello and few others. The amount of insight ive gathered already has been tremendous and eye opening. There have been several ah ha moments that Im still reeling from. Heres my storyIve always struggled with anxiety depression anhedonia and relatively bad skin. Ive spent a fuckton of money on different noots supplements diets and I still found myself struggling with all the symptomsalthough INI has been pretty helpful lately. Being able to associate certain gene mutations to problems Ive been struggling with has given me an extra kick of motivation to continue my goal for happiness and good health. Here are a few examples of what ive found.I have  NRCrs rs genetic mutations that are associated with glucocorticoid resistance high cortisol and chronic fatigue syndrome. I had a blood test a month back and my cortisol was very high at . ugdl  range being .  .. My insulin was also very high  I tested at  uUmL and the at risk range was anything more than . Im a skinny guy who eats relatively well and it made no sense to have that level of insulin with a blood glucose level of  while fasting. Turns out I have a relatively common mutation that relates to high than normal fasting blood glucose levelsI also have  VDR mutations that are rarers rs that cause downreulgated vitamin D receptors and can effect my dopamine levels. My last bloodtest had my levels at  which is lower side of normal. I dug more into this and while my blood levels were barely above normal my actual serum levels were probably too low. Here is an excerpt from foundmyfitness report. It is known that supplementing with  IU of vitamin D per day generally raises serum hydroxy vitamin D levels by around  ngml. This may not be the case for people with the affected genotypes rsAC and rsCC which may require higher vitamin D supplementation doses to achieve the same serum levels as individuals without these polymorphisms.There are many more mutations for phosphatidylcholine levels being too low MTRR mutations that say I need to supplement hydroxycobalamin GAD mutations that tie to high glutamate and low GABA low conversion of betacarotene to retinol and a bunch of others. While I know these SNPs arent an exact science its still given me a crazy amount of insight to the problems Ive been struggling with and ways to treat it with supplements and diet. For those of you who have the cashancestryandme is  ancestry has a newer chip so id recommend that one im considering getting another test through them Id highly recommend doing this. I plan on talking with an endocrinologist for some more insight into my issues but I now have some real direction to go with my health diet and supplements and boy am I excited to get started. ,Nootropics,d9oha2b,9,t5_2r81c

9560532,0,t3_5bmm1a,Theres a few RC amphetamines that have a higher Nootropic profile than the amphs that are typically used for enhancement purposes specifically FMA in this case but there are others I just havent used them. FMA is unique because it provides zero euphoria but also has zero crashcomedown and my Fitbit reports that my heartrate doesnt even increase so theres no jitters. The broscience explanation that Ive cobbled together is because it acts almost exclusively or completely exclusively on dopamine but I dont know if thats valid or if we even have enough data on the substance to really know either way why FMA in particular has none of the typical amphetamine side effects and all of the Nootropic benefits. There is also pretty much zero data on safety but the presence of Fluoride in this case based again entirely on reddit broscience appears to actually make this amphetamine more safe owing something to the exceptional bond strength of Fluoride causing a lesser amount of neurotoxic metabolic waste.,Nootropics,d9rj5n4,1,t5_2r81c

However its not a drugged feeling or anything it feels like your brain is partially lazyhappy and thought clarity remains mostly intact.These effects can be good for particular kinds of depression that dont involve high anxiety or psychoticdepersonalizationderealization symptoms since a lot of depressed people are stuck constantly selfassessing and this might be just the right supplement to help. Its not as useful for anxiety and it interacts with the dopamine system so in the nogo cases their comorbid symptoms might have delayed recovery time or worse.Also CAUTION BIPOLAR DISORDER MIGHT BE INVOLVED WITH INOSITOL IN PART. Do not use inositol if you suspect or have been confirmed to be bipolar.I would recommend recommend to cycle this if used nonacutely.

10105821,0,t3_5klc0g,Generally speaking Rx antidepressents are not going to be eas ffective as an MAOI inhibitor such as Parnate or Nardil or something like Ketamine. However before you go down those routes you could also have a go at a TCA like Clomipramine. Here is a good page about Clomipramine Quote gt Clomipramine is usually thought of by doctors as a treatment for obsessivecompulsive disorder OCD. But it is a potent antidepressant with dual SNRI action see tables of comparative receptor affinity data below. There is better evidence for clomipramines superior effectiveness for refractory depression than for any other drug. The frequency with which it is ceased because of side effects is no greater than SSRIs and probably less that venlafaxine see below. It is less toxic in overdose than venlafaxine see my TCA review for further details .I would also recommend reading other pages on this website in particular his Thinking life stress and depression pagesIf you want to try something else first you could also have a go at SEMAX. There is no evidence to support this recommendation simply because the studies havent been done... however anecdotally it did get me out of a depression and the effect was acute and quite strong. Polygala Tenufolia also seems promising from the anecdotes. ,Nootropics,dbost8g,3,t5_2r81c

I just got out of medical debt and its set me back financially so bad that Id rather not drive myself back into it just for the results I had before. The only way I will ever get it to show up is if it happens while they are testing me and everyone is doing their job right. Since both can be highly inaccurate probability tells me I would have to be lucky. The only luck I found was while I felt like it was going to happen I was in front of a nurse and kind of pushed it myself cause its now or never... and dropped. She was freaking out and said she couldnt find a pulse and I turned white. This wasnt during anything meant to be stressful. I had just checked myself into urgent care and they kept asking me if I was ok because I was pale and had issues walking. I then looked up at them to speak and landed on the floor.

10408750,0,t1_dclsq8b,What I mean is that the growing pains are associated with NGF and BDNF release. Sometimes it radiates through the legs and you get the same emotional swings as are being described by NSI.Its a classical feature of NMDA antagonostic substances to cause growing pains anxiety and sometimes extreme mood swings because cells in the hippocampus are growing at such a fast pace that it affects the amygdala that is interconnected with the hippocampus. Other side effects are being remarkably tired because the cells are growing.Ive been taking ltheanine since second of january and I definately feel so good that it reminds me of how I was when I was like  years old.. It is very ironic that I am going back to the same behaviours that I had back then and the same mindset.. This is coming from someone who had extreme flashbacks due to PTSD of not as long as . months ago.I take  mg a day. Sometimes the effect of dopamine is very pronounced. Sometimes its sedating. What theanine is absolutely fantastic at is making the act of socializing very very pleasurable. You are so eloquent and so fluent that its just.. I dont know how to describe it.Magnesium lthreonate mg Zinc  mg Ltheanine mgThats it. Sometimes I add caffeine to counter the side effects.. But thats it. That is my stack and it works fantastically.Read about sleep to and you will see that sleep is very important for the regulation of BDNF in the hippocampus and a decrease in sleep is associated with decreased levels of BDNF in the hippocampus.Its quite fascinating that sleep deprivation is associated with hypomania psychosis and ADHD  symtoms.. Ironic that some meds we prescribe to these conditions have side effects that actually disrupt sleep architecture and just create a vicious cycle of being put on more meds creating a lot of profit for big pharma..I mean how many of us have had some anxiety been scared and started Googling  mood swings   cant focus   scared.WebMD is one of the top ranked links in Google a website that is notorious with their affiliation with big pharmaceutical companies and suddenly you are filling all criterias for Bipolar disorder ADHD and anxiety disorder.Not very people seem to know the history of the DSM and how unscientific psychiatry actually is.Read this e.g.You are then put on olanzapine SSRI and Elvanse.. Thats how it all starts. When in fact you just needed some sleep.. A huge amount of all psychiatric disorders are associated with a loss of neurons in the hippocampus and usually if you look at all psychiatric diagnosis they are usually comorbid with insomnia.If you are American then I feel truely sorry for you guys. Because your foodculture is completely fucked up. You do not eat any vegetables good meat or fruit..

10505784,0,t1_dcyr363,I would personally start with piracitam andor aniracetam. Those two are pretty darn safe as far as Noots go and cheap. They also seem to work well. The effect is mild for me but present and helpful. My personal favorite racetam is Phenylpiracetam. Its more potent and has other effects. I dont seem to develop a strong tolerance for it luck? and the effects are helpful for work. As a warning Phenylpiracetam is pretty potent. You will likely get a high off it when you first take it especially if you go too high in dose. I was talking about mg mg x a day a day for a few months I am cycling off for now mostly to remember what it was like without it. I started at mg dose. You need to figure out what works for you. mg is much more than most people take but for me it has felt fine. And I was able to find studies that showed that a  milligram dose should be safe. Another thing Phenylpiracetam is really good as a preworkout supplement. I dont know how to explain it but phenylpiracetam makes it way easier to push weights. I dont know if thats your thing but just a thought. I believe it was even added to the list of Controlled Substances for the Olympics. Now they are pretty strict so that doesnt mean that much but its notable anyway.Also for racetams it helps many to take choline with it. For me that is helpful but not essential. I never get Choline headaches really but it does seem to work better with a Choline source. That could also just be the fact that choline has a little bit of a nootropic effect as well.I do have another recommendation along the racetamcholine lines... kinda. You might consider Centrophenoxine. Its cheap and there are cases of people taking it for  years and having decent benefits. Its not the most powerful stuff in the world for me its a really subtle effect. I have taken it for quite a while now. Different nootropics come and go for me but Centrophenoxine seems to stick around. Using Centrophenoxine I just always seem to feel better its mild but I can tell when I missed a day on accident its good stuff.Good luck!,Nootropics,dcyxxey,2,t5_2r81c

A good psychiatrist should be able to solve your problems  and provide you with the RX needed to purchase these medicines at the store.The psychiatrist has the right knowledge to help you. The advantage of doing this with the help of a doctor is that you wont waste a lot of time and hardship experimenting. Yes experimenting by yourself mostly with supplements that dont work is difficult and a big waste of time. It is difficult because you have to take substances and then expose yourself to the social situations which you are already scared of.Make no mistake  the medicines which are usually prescribed by mainstream medicines for social anxiety  such as zoloft sertraline and xanax alprazolam are also the most effective for most people.The problem is finding a good doctor one who has experience and who will not use excessive doses.Memantine is a very powerful substance with a very long half life. Its effect heavily depends on the dosage  take too much and you will feel very depressed for a few days or so. Take a small dose and you may feel slightly relaxed. I would not take it for social anxiety tough.I have no experience with the oxytocin nasal spray. You can find oxytocin on sites such as Ceretropic and you could make a nasal spray.

10596508,0,t3_5rosjf,Interesting theory. Let me challenge you.SSRIs inhibit the serotonin transporter leading to elevated extracellular serotonin levels. This causes depressionlike symptoms acutely increasing anxiety and stress in most people most people who start SSRIs report worsening of depression in the first few weeks. So far in line with your theory that too much serotonin can cause depression and anxiety right?MDMA is mainly a serotonin releaser. However the serotonin release by MDMA doesnt cause depressionlike symptoms rather it causes antidepressant effects. How can this be? Why does more serotonin from SSRIs cause depression but more serotonin from MDMA does not cause depression?,Nootropics,dd8y5bq,6,t5_2r81c
10598117,0,t1_dd920ys,gtYoure derailing this threadNo Im proving you wrong.gtIts not about MDMAMDMA is a drug that greatly increases serotonin and typically leads to profound euphoria.gtit was about excessive serotonin causing social anxiety and depression at least in rodents.Your entire argument is moot because youre trying to connect mental disorders like social anxiety and depression back to one neurotransmitter serotonin. There are millions of different things at play when it comes to mental disorders.gtI dont know about these drugs youre asking aboutBut I do I have personal experience with them and I understand their mechanism of action very well. They all increase serotonin.gtbut Ive already linked something about druggiesGreat looking a bluelight thread and calling everyone druggies is really helping your argument.gta similar drug to MDMA MBDB that doesnt have nearly the same euphoric effect due to less dopamine release the neurotransmitter responsible for much of the euphoria.Three things. MBDB is considered weaker than MDMA. MBDB still produces feelings of euphoria lowered social anxiety and overall increase in mood...While it almost exclusively works on serotonin as you mentioned. . Obviously increasing dopamine will produce a feeling of euphoria.gtHTP obviously doesnt cause euphoriaI have first hand experience with HTP.

10866866,0,t1_de0ml1k,Its a very blurred line between helping yourself and hurting yourself with substances but alcohol is probably not going to help in any way.  I find depending on what it is something that eases your anxietyopens up new avenues of thought can detangle your mind from the cognitive impairments of anxietyetc allowing you to think about the situation from a less emotional and more rational view.  Afterwards you can recall back to when anxiety was at a low and not only know but genuinely accept that theres no logical reason to care.  As a counter if your issue was say that you have schoolwork to do and you take something to feel okay about avoiding the schoolwork then youre making yourself feel okay with avoiding schoolwork temporarily which is something that will affect your wellbeing in the long run.  I struggle with this as well.  Part of my personality is addictive when Im fine Ill want more anyway unless I constantly keep in mind why I should be fine with fine all the shit that more attitude had got me into especially in college.

We live in a polarized world and the general opinion of drugs is theyre bad as a single entity which is absurd.  drug is a word for substances that carry one single characteristic in common.

Not because I think you have some sort of disease that the doctors are just going to treat symptomatically but because you may have a vitamin or mineral deficiency that would easily explain this and you need a blood test to confirm it. My friend was in a similar condition as you though it didnt get as extreme where hed sleep for long periods of time but still feel fatigued all day no matter how much coffee he slugged. Turns out he had an Iron and B deficiency. His was caused primarily by Crohns Disease which was diagnosed shortly therafter. Yours couldve came about simply because you overworked your body so long. As for your sleep debt fears dont get too wrapped up in it. When they say sleep debt cant be paid I think theyre talking about the logic of I slept  hours tonight so Im going to sleep for  tomorrow. In your case I think if you manage to return to a healthy sleepwake cycle your quality of life will seem as good as it was before this whole clusterfuck started. Even if it isnt AS good as it could be because of this rough patch youll be feeling so much better that I dont think youll even detect that you arent quite at your best in this regard.

Physiol Behav. Tenuigenin ameliorates learning and memory impairments induced by ovariectomy.Estrogen deficiency is associated with cognitive impairment. Hormone replacement therapy HRT has proven to be effective in preventing and reversing the memory and learning deficiencies. However conventional estrogenic treatment could increase the risks of breast cancer and venous thromboembolism. Tenuigenin TEN is putatively believed as the active component extracted from a Chinese herb Polygala tenuifolia root. Although TEN has been shown to enhance learning and memory in healthy mice it remains unknown whether or not TEN could ameliorate learning and memory impairments. In the present study mice were divided into four groups shamoperated sham ovariectomized OVX OVXestradiol benzoate EB and OVXTEN groups. Stepthrough passive avoidance and Ymaze tests were used to assess learning and memory abilities and the number of nitric oxide synthase NOS positive neurons and the synaptic measurement of hippocampal CA area were examined. The results showed that TEN was given orally to OVX mice leading to the improvement of learning and memory in stepthrough passive avoidance and Ymaze tests. TEN could reduce the loss of NOS positive neurons and prevent the synaptic morphological changes induced by ovariectomy. Our results suggest that TEN may exert a potential therapeutic value for menopause cognitive dysfunction.Downvoted for troll or idiot you may choose.  ,Nootropics,df631kz,6,t5_2r81c

11348310,0,t1_dfi79o9,Upvoted for the second portion of the reply. Physical activity modulates catecholamine activity. Interestingly dopamine betahydroxylase DBH is inhibited by disulfiram tropolone and most selectively by nepicastat. Disulfiram Antabuse is used in some cases for the treatment for alcoholism but also inhibiting DBH would reduce the concentration of norepinephrine and epinephrine. Heres a biosynthesis diagram   IMHO I think increasing physical activity is the best response to this question.,Nootropics,dfib6ft,3,t5_2r81c

11457472,0,t3_63g4s8, Anything that improves processing speed should probably help with that. Likely bets are amphetamine caffeine nicotine. These substances almost surely increase processing speed which mediates verbal fluency.Other bets can be piracetam phosphatidylserine supplementation ALCAR. I think these have only been shown to increase processing speed in aged or unhealthy subjects so YMMV. To the people saying reading I say bullshit. I can recognize a shitton more words than I actually use. If there is a conversion factor from recognition vocabulary to use vocabulary its not very high. Ive had much larger changes from various supplements or changes in situation than Ive had from years of steadily increasing my recognition vocabulary.,Nootropics,dfup2x3,1,t5_2r81c

11483888,0,t1_dfweihd,Peptides typically have near zero bioavailability and generally do not cross the BBB well either. Like how to effectively make oral peptides into usable medicines as a general solution that could work for nearly any peptide is so difficult that no one has ever managed to do it yet. As a sub problem depending on the size of the peptide and its properties they may be unusable in through typical cellular transport at all maybe their interaction with a ubiquitous enzyme or how they are treated by first pass metabolism the reasons vary greatly between peptides meaning that they may not be useful outside direct injection into a target tissue. So not just the BBB but all kinds of barriers are present to making peptides useful. At best typically effective peptides are useful only when administered by IV. Most research that Im aware of particularly in my own field of expertise uses direct injection because its the most effective or only effective way to administer and to standardize dosage since metabolism is too complex to deal with on an individual basis.Delta sleep inducing peptide is a great example. Very cool peptide. I bet a lot of people could benefit if its effects translate from murine models. But youll need to inject it. And there is some debate whether even that is effective vs direct injection to the endogenous portions of the brain. ,Nootropics,dfxp3hv,4,t5_2r81c

11520798,0,t3_64bhwl,From my experience ltheanine is the best nootropic that effects relaxation. It is considered a nondrowsy relaxant. Taking doses of ltheanine will lower stress and can in my experience take the edge off of taking caffeine as a stimulant. It helps prevent jitters and lets me focus. The newest product I take combines  mg of caffeine and  mg of ltheanine. This helps wake me up but without the jitters a big cup of coffee or an energy drink would give me. Usually lasts me around  hours of increased productivity and focus and I have no issues going to sleep after having this. I highly recommend this.,Nootropics,dg1vu7a,1,t5_2r81c

11674877,0,t1_dgjceqy,gt But fermented foods are cheaper and will do the same thing. I think its a little misleading to equate variety with multiple strainsspecies. Ive never spent more than mo on probiotics.Your post on the rmicrobiome seems to say differently. The benefits of fermented foods are typically WAY oversold by health advocates. They do have some benefits but they are not the right strains that live natively in the human gut. Their primary mode of action is producing compounds like hydrogen peroxide acids amp alcohol that suppress other microbes thus a beneficial affect on pathogens. But they will not colonize the gut or perform the necessary roles of native strains. Remember that fermenting cabbage sauerkraut is done to preserve it.gt Thats non sequitur and shows a misunderstanding of the significance of brands amp reputation.Now youre just sounding combative. This is subjective. People respond differently right? I had great experience with the GOL probiotic so have many others. Ive also recommended VSLwhich is an excellent probitoic Hyperbiotics pearlsalso great even though they have low CFU. Better survival rate and the NOW brand which is a well known and reputable. Im sure there are many more brands out there that are subjectively better for some people because again... everyones microbiome and response to probiotics is different.

Have concrete plans together in advance for where you can go where you can be away from people or maybe with people who you know can be comforting towards you.  Set the environment there up in a way that youll find calming but not distracting so that you can feel the tail end of the anxiety and let it wash away.Looks like theres some evidence that propanolol might be particularly helpful for this   Potato starch and possibly probiotics with it for HDACinhibiting effects might be a good safe addon.,Nootropics,dgnamwo,1,t5_2r81c
