I agree on the part plan too  you wont see all the artists you want to see and thats awesome  youll discover new sounds new artists. Yeah. Terrible. I was at the camera split on Mainstage and someone was just turning his back to Kaskade literally not giving a fuck. But when camera guys arrived he was like hes having the time of his life. God if I see him on the aftermovie.. Nobody can stand a full day. Its physically impossible ! The food was AWESOME. And Im not kidding. The pizzas were hand made and cooked in a wood oven the asian food was awesome burgers were lovely.. it was way beyond expectations and way better than in any european festival Ive ever been. Bad side is the price  for a Burger.. Totally. Got randomly hugged by beautiful girls sang with people I dont even remember had amazing times. BUT there was assholes too I can confirm that. The kind of people who buys a beer just to throw it on people pushes you to be in front or being totally rude to people. You have the chance that millions of people want dont act like an asshole ! Well Im not with you on that one. I know they make beautiful photosvideos but I really love having mine. Id definitely ban people who only films though. I saw some asses getting seriously kicked because of that. They really care about the decoration.  true. I was thinking that it was overhyped.

3670677,0,t3_32907w,I stayed in Brussels in  and Antwerp last year. The problem with Brussels was that the official shuttles around euros a day left between am only. I guess thats not so bad if youre only going for  day but it was hard work getting up that early each day when you werent getting back from the festival til am each night. It took over an hour to get there and there was plenty of buses on the way home. Last year staying in Antwerp was easier just because we got to catch up on our sleep more and it was closer. We got a free bus there one day and a train the other  days for a few euros. It took around half hour to get there and trains and buses ran regularly. However trying to get home was a complete NIGHTMARE. None of the stewards knew where the buses home were or where the bus to the train station was. We literally spent  hours on the first night walking around and every steward sending us in the wrong direction. They were completely clueless. At am after a long day dancing you dont want to spend  hours walking aimlessly in a foreign country in the middle of nowhere. The next night walking again trying to find a bus we got speaking to a guy who was working at the VIP bars and was a local heading back to Antwerp so he let us go with him and got us onto the right bus and train. The trains didnt leave at the time scheduled they just seemed to leave at any old time. It was a disorganised mess. We did have a little issue first year too as the coaches back to Brussels dont leave from where they drop you off. You had to get onto a free public bus put on for the event which took you ten minutes down the road to a big field with all the coaches. That took us quite a while to find out too as we were looking for the coaches and again were told different and wrong information by the stewards. I would however opt for staying in Antwerp just because it was closer cheaper and I didnt have to drag myself out of bed like a zombie early each morning. I guess its not too bad what you choose if youre only going for one day. There was nothing in Antwerp to do though I didnt find it a nice place as someone else on this forum has said. We stayed in an Ibis next to the railway station. Convenient and cheap but a horrible place to stay in. Worse place Ive ever stayed. OK for one night but hell for  nights like we had to endure! ,Tomorrowland,cqaoja4,1,t5_2thj2

4235419,0,t1_cs2tilw,Yeah I understand the whole Europe doesnt care for trap bit. But I guess I was referring to the vibes. Like I come in here pretty often and anytime anyone mentions mad decent or trap its automatically frowned upon. I believe that trap has its place in the edm community just as much as any other subgenre. And to generalize that its just filled with douchery is wrong but I get how you saw that at EDC because I saw that as well. I cant stand the douchy bros either but they are at every festival so you cant let it ruin a whole genre! I love love love trap but I also love hardstyle and hardcore! Mad Decent isnt just trap anyway what about that moombahton? Nobody likes to move their hips in Europe? Everyone just wants to jump up and down till their legs fall off?All I am saying is I am feeling some genre racismfor lack of a better word on the boards and I hope I dont see that at the festival because I was really hoping for some plur and good vibes. ,Tomorrowland,cs30z16,2,t5_2thj2

Yes heard lot of horror stories About camping last year. I have booked a real lovely apartment with a big living room and one of those really long group l shaped  sleep plush couches and a separate bedroom. Actually looking for  or  people to split the cost maybe. When you dont camp it solves lot of issues like hygiene proper food and plenty of rest so you can rage to the fullest when the time comes and not feel like the walking dead for the next few days after.

4808494,0,t3_3gmsso,We did Global Journey which is a lot better chance of getting tickets as its more expensive. We had  computer  laptops  iPads and a phone all trying to get tickets you can use the same link more than once  its just linked to your name for when you buy. We got into the site on  laptops by refreshing at  and  even though the website wasnt supposed to be live until . Best method I THINK is to open your link in Chrome thats what we used and DO refresh on that one and also open your link in Firefox or any other browser but DONT refresh on that one just wait for it to refresh itself. Some people like me have luck refreshing while others have luck by staying in the automatic queue so by using  browsers you can try both methods and hopefully one will work for you! Another suggestion was that on the browser that youre NOT refreshing open your link at  then open another tab at  then     and . Keep all these tabs open and one might refresh! Someone online managed to work out their certain timer system or something and those who opened the link at a certain time before  got into the site first so its worth trying  So one browser  keep refreshing the page. Another browser  just open the link in a new tab once a minute until  and dont refresh any of them! Hopefully youll get some luck and get in! It also might be worth you looking at GJ goes on sale  weeks before worldwide sale if you dont get tickets in that then you still have a chance at worldwide sale ,Tomorrowland,cu0nf51,1,t5_2thj2

6449998,0,t1_czm55lm,Depending on how much data you use will depend on how much you spend. The base cost is  euros and it gives you unlimited sms  minutes of phone time and gb of data. The sms is only Belgian based though so keep that in mind. My recommendation would be to buy the  euro card then go and instantly put an extra  euro top up on it while youre there. Itll add an extra gb of data to it. This year Im probably going to add a little more than  euros to it as last year I ran out of data around the last day.Also take into account that this was including a  day stay in Belgium prior to going to the festival where I was using the data moderately. If youre looking to mainly use snapchat instagram and facebook to add people you meet there depending on how heavily you snap chat you will probably need at least gb.,Tomorrowland,czmgxxu,1,t5_2thj2

Heck if insiders within the travel industry use it why not take advantage ourselves? I now get to fulfill this dream because my travel buddy did that for me.I dont know about you but for many of us its crazy expensive to leave the US and its why so many of us dont. Azul told me that America is sadly known as the No Vacation Nation. I truly believe if the world traveled more we would be more connected and not fear or hate each other. That same beautiful feeling that occurs in Tomorrowland.I just wanted to help others like Azul helped me. But he is right he says that you cant help people who cant believe there are people who want to help. So we should first change that. I should first change that! I should do something about it so that next year this wont sound like a scam but an accepted fact!If Azul can do it then perhaps we all can. The challenge to make travel really affordable without fear or skepticism. It does sound crazy and it will continue to sound crazy until someone decides to change it. Decides to fight the status quo.

I knew it was worth sticking around solely due to the fact they werent streaming it. I checked out Alessos set on YouTube and it was pretty much your standard mainstage set.One thing to note though is that it definitely did pick up as the set went along it wasnt just a general repetitive beat and they were playing and mixing their own songs.

10852612,0,t1_ddzd2ds,Last year they had really good strawberry daiquiri cocktails which were like a slush and they tasted so good especially since it was boiling hot but other than that yeah I pretty much ran off Red Bull the entire weekend lol. I guess you can have a few drinks in the campsite before going down but probably not enough to get you drunk especially if youre going down early.,Tomorrowland,ddzdc0t,2,t5_2thj2

11100971,0,t1_denhacl,dont think they are pretty sure the locals pick them up and do with them what they please or they get thrashed i remember seeing in one of those local news stories that locals get free range of the camping the day after and can take with them whatever they please of the stuff people leave behind.After that TML cleans the place up and just bins everything they find atleast thats what they do for the MG the easy tents might be reused.,Tomorrowland,deqaa8r,1,t5_2thj2
11108889,0,t3_5ymca5,Honestly its very much okay but during my four years Ive seen a few people being in very bad conditions and some people being carried away on stretchers. Most likely they didnt died but yeah things do happen. A lot less than in other festivals. Keep an eye out for brothers!,Tomorrowland,der6lf5,4,t5_2thj2

11422706,0,t3_62w16w,This year is the first year that Tomorrowland offers tickets with included tent for the Dreamville the big camp area. So its hard to say anything about those but if the pictures on the website are accurate it looks like you are gonna get popup tents and they suck really badly. They are super easy and quick to set up but cant handle anything other than perfect weather conditions.If you on the other hand are asking about the easy tent area those are more premium and can handle rain without any issues. At least in my experience from the last two years Ive been doing easy tent.,Tomorrowland,dfqr39i,2,t5_2thj2
