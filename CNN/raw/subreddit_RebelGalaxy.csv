5450140,0,t1_cw815dk,If thats the problem then there is no problem.  The game is not graphically taxing at all.  The second card adds nothing.,RebelGalaxy,cw8b3a0,-2,t5_3410k

5480032,0,t1_cwbu5uc,I too have flown and loved the Scarab. Made my first million in that little ship. Around the time systems started getting to Mk. it started to feel like it couldnt quite hold its own in combat missions. Still a great little hauler though. Im running the Arcturus now with x Mining Lasers Mk. under the nose and along the sides and aft to knock down shields and shred fighters with x Particle Lasers Mk. along the forward dorsal spine and x Shieldbuster Mk. atop the conning tower. I tried going full Particle but I couldnt get shields down fast enough to get my Neutron broadsides in without spamming the Shieldbuster. Also Mk. Particle Lasers are k more expensive than the same tier Mining Laser.  My Neutron broadsides outrange and outdamage the particle lasers by a fair bit anyway so Ill hit them with a shieldbuster and a few broadsides before boosting in on a strafing run. The  particles are still great for longer range fighter defense and adding that extra bit of hull damage to capitals. All that combined with Mk. Dumbfire Torpedoes absolutely annihilates any capital ships. I highly recommend the Arcturus to anyone once you get to about mil net worth. Had about mil in cash from running Merchant guilds in the first  systems when I picked her up and outfitted with Mk.. Im up to mil net now and shes running strong. I could afford a McKinley right now to start hauling again to save up for a dreadnaught but Im not ready to give up my Star Destroyer just yet. Just wish I could paint it somehow.,RebelGalaxy,cwc4iyg,2,t5_3410k
5480914,0,t3_3q5nu7,just so you know Head to Zenon systems guild traders station immedietly. only applies you your save as the maps for every playthrough is randomized saying head to the merchants guild station in a system that sells mkgtmk parts would let people find an equivalent system in there map.,RebelGalaxy,cwc8l0o,7,t5_3410k
5503798,0,t3_3qgwc6,Its biohazardous waste and can be refined into weaponsgrade boomfood. Thats why stations at war want it so bad.,RebelGalaxy,cwf5tus,14,t5_3410k
5510177,0,t1_cwfrwxf,I freaking love doing that pulling up to a ship so close their turrets cant hit you then mashing the broadside button.  Even though you arent charging the shots the DPS is insane and it looks so awesome sending wave after wave of broadside rounds into their hull.,RebelGalaxy,cwfz4bv,2,t5_3410k
5520258,0,t3_3qel7d,This happened to me last night. Wasted an hour hoping it would work and hed turn in his goods so I could earn that k. No dice had to fail mission and move on.,RebelGalaxy,cwh9h9u,1,t5_3410k
5524643,0,t3_3qni0b,What is it from?  I have yet to hear that one I think.,RebelGalaxy,cwhtmr8,1,t5_3410k
5530258,0,t3_3qu79j,Im approaching end game I think.  Running a Radovich right now with MK beams for broadsides and  MK  particle and  MK plasma turrets.  MK EMP flak as secondary.  MK shields and MK hull.  MK ramming deflectors that I rarely use.Im saving up for a Blackgate.  Just a few more missions.....,RebelGalaxy,cwijf6l,2,t5_3410k
5535260,0,t3_3qvyjk,I found the easiest way to make money while loosing a bit of citizen rep. I have the large merchant guild cargo extender. I went to the system next to midway and bought  pure water. Then I started looking for distress signals killed the enemies and hailed the traders. IF you had only pure water in your cargo they would try to buy the  pieces for kk. Then you would just demand the cargo back and try the next guy. I found  distress beacons with  and  traders and made  mil in  minutes. Then I went to midway with full load of pure water and sold it for another  mil. I tripled my value in an hour with this and didnt have any money problems after that one run,RebelGalaxy,cwj6fh3,2,t5_3410k
5551099,0,t3_3r4xs0,I came to ask this question as well and saw this post here. I want to play as a pirate but everytime I think about doing it I think of this frustrating game of neverending tag where your target and you are stuck in space not moving. happened in the first system when I came back with mk gear dont tell me were going the same speedThe game needs to explain how to intercept and stop this neverending standstill BS. Ive tried going around and killing warp to try and break his warp. Its hilarious. Im at a standstill best guess for the right location to break his warp and he just blows by in the blink of an eye and Im off chasing again. Bad guys sure dont have this problem.,RebelGalaxy,cwl5y8y,2,t5_3410k

5801033,0,t3_3ummsx,Ships already have a snailspace reverse Kill your speed then hold back on the stick.  Not sure what the equivalent key is for keyboard amp mouse.I also was slightly disappointed when I tried to fly directly through a jump gate and nothing happened.  I mean you can autodock at stations if youre close enough.,RebelGalaxy,cxg68z9,2,t5_3410k
5810012,0,t3_3ur5f4,Best way to avoid being mobbed when grabbing a dead drop is to tractor it in when youre near maximum tractor range and then boost the hell out of there the moment it locks on without draining it completely.The more distance you can put between the drop site and your ship by the time it enters your cargo hold the less likely you are to get surrounded.,RebelGalaxy,cxhace9,3,t5_3410k
5828818,0,t1_cxjhcw8,Hate that it is scripted because they just spawn completely surrounding me. Gives me no chance...,RebelGalaxy,cxjomn9,3,t5_3410k
6016912,0,t1_cy1z6h0,If you want to feel a little more involved you can stick with one of the smaller faster ship classes.  That way you still have to press some buttons to make the bad guys asplode.  I find the Red Devil Damocles to be the best middle ground and its very much the big brother of the starting Tennhausen in styling.,RebelGalaxy,cy8cdbs,1,t5_3410k
6161178,0,t3_3zwf4o,From my experience using the Fault Tracker software I never got more than  item from an asteroid when I had a mix of beams even when targeting weakspots. When i went for all mining lasers I was back to getting  drops per asteroid.,RebelGalaxy,cypynou,2,t5_3410k

6321852,0,t1_cz87ldn,I feel like were pioneering here in a good way. Learning slowly and discovering the bits and pieces of a good game before its all been diagnosed and documented... thats pretty fun to me.,RebelGalaxy,cz8846h,2,t5_3410k
6513512,0,t3_44ol1p,Right there with you bud this game reminds me of Freelancer its great. Would be nice to be able to keep track of how much you payed for certain commodities.,RebelGalaxy,czt1qjt,3,t5_3410k
7823638,0,t1_d3v3e5s,Thats odd  I havent yet encountered a situation where either A abandoning the Mission didnt remove the cargo from my hold or B I couldnt jettison it. How many systems into this playthrough are you and do you remember which Mission it was?,RebelGalaxy,d3vfzef,1,t5_3410k

8498863,0,t1_d63138b,You have to get there by doing the missions. In reference to my comment I was talking about the world closest to Charon not Charon itself.,RebelGalaxy,d63wqy5,1,t5_3410k
8510466,0,t1_d65czzv,I havent done one yet but I imagine its much like the rescue missions. I assume you have a mercenary with you too? They certainly come in handy.,RebelGalaxy,d65d4ck,1,t5_3410k
8532720,0,t1_d685ez0,Trust me I understand yet this card still does meet the requirements so that really should not be the issue.  Other computers with older intedgrated HD graphics runs the game fine.  ,RebelGalaxy,d685l1q,1,t5_3410k

8803055,0,t3_50pvct,Congrats on the big upgrade! The cargo hold wont change difficulty significantly. If you bought your way up to Vanguard right now it would probably hurt a bit. Were talking about millions of credits in upgrades.,RebelGalaxy,d760ab7,2,t5_3410k
