2559477,0,t3_2p1n9w,The E video wasnt rendered on PC nor does it look any better than the demo on a technical level. The reason why it looks looks more visually pleasing isnt better graphics its primarily the darker lighting and the wetter environment. The fact is things look bloody awesome when its night and everythings dark. Thats why Jurassic Park did most of their CGI like that. It makes things look so much better. Thats why those effects still hold up today. Look at their daytime scenes by comparison and they look significantly worse although the good animation masks some of their problems But the polygon count texture resolution AA effects lighting and shadow quality etc is all exactly the same.Furthermore a lot of the comparison screenshots are deeply flawed. They use low res highly compressed screenshots from the PSX livestream which also had incorrect black levels. Use the high quality download from gamersyde.com with the corrected black levels and its a far more fair comparison. ,uncharted,cmsnsxy,6,t5_2s8ye

7599915,0,t1_d362hea,I know why Sam died im saying the fact that they put his fake death as an integral part of the story played with his character being expendable. A lot of people commented on how much they enjoyed the game simply because the chance of one of the characters dying kept them going.Its not always bad for a company to take a leap instead of being obsessive about doing everything the kosher way.You said it yourself if the main lesson you got out of the story is that greed ultimately becomes your downfall then what better way to enforce that lesson by killing of one of the characters? Think about this For the past two games some of the best parts involved when Nate was on the verge of death or Sully was believed to have died. Death gets your emotions going!Now if they killed people left and right that would be just as bad as what they did. The key to not being cheap is to do it sporadically and carefully. Something they didnt do.That scene playing as the daughter at the end was CRINGE CITY. Shameless milking for a future franchise made by another dev. ,uncharted,d362lxk,-1,t5_2s8ye
7601663,0,t3_4jcmk9,I was afraid judging from the trailers that they were gonna write her as the nagging wife that wants her husband to stay at home with her and have a quiet life. And that wouldnt have sit well with me because thats not who Elena is. But I absolutely loved that they clear that out of the way right at the beginning when shes the one thats trying to push Nate to take the Malaysia job and call Sully and hes the one afraid to do so. Even after she found out about the truth she never once said she was pissed Nate was risking his life or taking on a dangerous adventure she was pissed he lied to her about it and about having a brother. Sully pretty much predicted that reaction after the auction when he says that Nate isnt giving Elena enough credit. And I also loved the way she was sucked back into the action had fun with it and in the end was the one to admit that they couldnt give up a life of adventures because that would have destroyed them and was already doing so.I just absolutely loved Elena in this game she felt so real.,uncharted,d369qnb,9,t5_2s8ye

Moreover it often carries a repressed knowledge that the object of longing might never return.

8263799,0,t3_4jcmk9,I fully agree with everything thats been said. One thing of note though. There are many points where you as a player are expected to solve an environmental puzzle and only rarely did I experience one of the companions giving a hint for how to solve it. This is a shame as pressing a button for a hint seems out of place in a Naughty Dog game where immersion and characters interacting is so important. However cue the arrival of a female character in the form of Elena and suddenly she is solving things left right and center. This to me had a slight feeling of trying to make up for years of useless female characters by making them excessively good at looking after themselves and solving problems. This has come up often in more recent media take The Force Awakens as another example. As such I felt zero tension in the build up to trying to rescue Elena when she was in the jeep on the lift as there was no doubt in my mind by that point that she would take care of the situation and that I would hear an obligatory comment of surprise from the male character. ,uncharted,d5aj6f7,1,t5_2s8ye

8743942,0,t1_d6ymlex,I know about the issues behind the scenes. Either way when closing out a series known for its own supernatural elements regardless of Indiana Jones it seems weird to drop it when this is for all intents and purposes the last game in the series. Sony may decide to continue it but in many ways it may just not be the same. It could easily be made by people who just dont have the same passion for it as the original devs. Were seeing that with the new MGS Id argue something similar happened with Halo  and  at least in terms of plot.But in regards to the human component and focusing on that as opposed to including a potentially distracting supernatural aspect Id debate this. If that was their goal and it very likely was considering TLOU I have to wonder why Sam was necessary for that. It feels weird to suddenly introduce a character who would have been mentioned at some point and act like he was always there since the beginning and push him so hard that Sully and Elena characters who have always been in the seriee are overshadowed by his presence. Of were talking about the human component and growing up and Nate finding what he truly wants in life..M then why oh why wasnt Elena hardcore in this? The absolute best parts imo were Nate and Elena. Whether it was the beginning at home or when hes actively lying to her because he promised he was done to when theyre reunited and tensions are running a little high because she just cant handle this... to her realizing just how much she missed it. Yeah Sam just complicates things in a fairly unnecessary way. I liked him I liked the flashback levels but again was his creation truly necessary? I dont think it was. First of all they could have made Sams role anybody else and itd be more believable. An old treasure hunting buddy or something. Having a random character introduced who is supposedly an old friend of Nates but was never mentioned before this game is waaaay more believable than his brother.So if the aim was to drop the supernatural and even have the plot itself take a backseat to character development and character arcs then why in the heck wouldnt you focus on the series actual main characters instead of trying to suddenly create a brand new main character and shoehorn his importance into the Uncharted universe? Sam has a bigger presence in this game than the old mentor buddy weve come to love whos been in all three previous games. Or his wife and love interest in all three previous games.Drop supernatural in favor of character development? Fine. Then truly close the book on the series main characters. I mean really focus on them. Aside from the new villain dont even introduce any new characters at all. You know what dropping Sam would have also opened up? More time to flesh out Rafe who I also think is one of the best villains but like always didnt get too much time to shine. Though that final duel was great.And again a curse is far less in your face than the previous games. And Id even be okay if it was more just suggested. Like if some of the journal entries from Burnes expedition discussed an otherworldly chill in the air and then as you go the author talks about the madness overtaking the crew and how the treasure is cursed. Nate and co. discuss the potential curse. Then we see what happened to the Founders then Averys progressively worse madness in the caves of body parts then finally what happened to Avery and Tew at the end. If it had simply hinted at but left it ambiguous that would have been just as good as having pirate ghosts come out of the mummies at the end. And in fact would likely be a lot better for the more character focused approach without totally sacrificing a staple of the franchise. I mean  already made it far more ambiguous than the first two and that was alright?,uncharted,d6yn9ef,1,t5_2s8ye
8786682,0,t3_50fpjs,I enjoyed the series as well. Id like to play them back to back like you did. The collection is so nice and I kind of hope the do the same thing for more series in the future.

10058399,0,t3_5jslzi,I think its fine Im sure well get more justification on why shes doing this maybe shes more interested in the antagonists reason for destabilizing the region looking for the maguffin. Dont think Druckman is involved in LL he wasnt in the panel at PSX. I wasnt a fan of how Nadine was presented in some parts of the story made a whole post about that but I like her as a character. The fact that shes paired up with Chloe is brilliant imo and is going to make for some great interactions. I doubt theres some sort of feminist or SJW agenda with the focus on female characters. I will concede that they were pretty heavily focused on in U in general though.,uncharted,dbimtpt,9,t5_2s8ye

10138987,0,t1_dbt3wh1,Yep they said it will be on shelves.  Also no DLC is an addon that gets added to an already installed game. Standalone DLC would only exist in the context of content thats also available as an addin to an existing game. AC Freedom Cry and TLOU Left Behind would be examples. First Light would not be DLC at all for example since you cant download it as an addin to Second Son. ,uncharted,dbt44mc,1,t5_2s8ye

10814016,0,t1_ddv6w9p,Sorry I wasnt trying to be passive aggressive.  I could never get into Tomb Raider for a couple reasons. First I didnt like the way I could be attacked out of nowhere by a bear or a pack of wolves. I like the way Uncharted  handles is better where you go into combat sequences and then come out of them. I like to relax while I work on the puzzle room and not have to worry about being attacked.The second thing was the mechanics. Just trying to get around was a pain at times. Which really didnt help when I was suddenly attacked.  That having been said Ive not played TR since number . Of course the mechanics have improved but what about combat? Is it still kinda sudden surprise fear attack? Or is it easier to tell when its time for battle vs time for puzzle?,uncharted,ddve18k,1,t5_2s8ye

Its not as if theyre bad games and not worth playing except for maybe UC that one has aged like shit and is a bit of chore for me to play after playing UC But UC is still my favourite of the series and UC is great fun as well. ,uncharted,dg66ezo,7,t5_2s8ye
