3168844,0,t1_coqfksy,Command center would get support abilities and detected hits would have such a huge margin of error that itd be extremely inaccurate. The realistic effects on vehicles would have to be manually controlled and since its not very game changing I dont think my teacher would give that good of a grade on it ,MilSim,coqg6ob,0,t5_2rewc

9464644,0,t3_5adk14,I use . It really depends. If Im in a firefight Im probably burning through  mags depending on the intensity. Ive had situations where we are holding an objective or holding off a large force. Other times maybe Im burning  mags in situations like cqbbuilding clearing. In any case you should not depend on using  mags max. Theres usually a point in which youll need to resupply but  has never failed me. You also take into account your squad and their output. If you have an automatic rifleman in your squad they can suppress easier so you dont have to use up so many mags. Hopefully your ftl or sl can delegate and pick and choose your battles. Edit also in my exp sidearms are pretty useless unless you actually do run out of ammo.  mags is plenty for that. Id even stick with  mags since I highly doubt there will be much use for it.,MilSim,d9fpkzd,2,t5_2rewc
