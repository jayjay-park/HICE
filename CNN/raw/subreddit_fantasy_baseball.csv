7143275,0,t3_4d68dr,I hav Marte on  of my teams.  I like Story too but his nd spot in the order can be taken away by LeMahiue where Martes spot is pretty firm.  ,fantasy_baseball,d1q4507,1,t5_2wrlk
11668407,0,t3_65zlus,Im a huge Paxton believer but I always preach bats over arms long term.  The metrics we have right now are better a projecting hitting stats and pitchers especially Paxton are very injury prone.  I like all of Thames peripherals at the moment.  They will certainly regress to the mean but stats like K and BB have been proven to stabilize over smaller sample sizes than other ratio stats.  So I think you can safely pencil Thames in for . BA and HR with decent walk rates.  The home ball park is great for him Hes been playing against LHP and the Brewers have some really talented bats around him.In the deepest of leagues its usually easier to find high impact high upside pitchers as opposed to hitters.  Or at the very least stream able starters.  The KC starters have been putting up surprising numbers if you really need to look deep.  Also some of the Reds middle relievers will get starting opportunities at some point.,fantasy_baseball,dgimo8f,1,t5_2wrlk
