The adaptions are faithful only changing gags that only work in manga hitting someone with a speech bubble the filler is good enough that you usually cant tell what is filler and what isnt and the animation while sketchy during the first few episodes is consistently good and the fight scenes are amazing.I usually recommend the manga but with Gintama I recommend the anime every time.,Gintama,cohbnv0,1,t5_2sc2h

5732152,0,t1_cx7m7ed,I suggest you reread the comic again Hijikata is very sharp in combat instinct became his weakness by carrying such a big plate makes his  instinct even more sensitive as usual. Kitaooji seen that as advantage so he was able to bait and strike Hijikata multiple times. In short Hijikatas sharp instinct strength became a big weakness against Kitaooji when he was carrying such a big burden the plate. If that was a real death combat then Kitaooji perhaps is no match against Hijikata and Itou.  Actually Its most likely Hjikata was holding back thorough the end Read this  .   He became fatigue and injured after dueling with Kitaooji even if he decided to went for it anyway it was perhaps too late  as his injure became more severe after Kyubei smashed him in the head. ,Gintama,cx7moez,1,t5_2sc2h

I made the same mistake a while back with the Berserk anime  suddenly I was being told to go and read the manga because everyones got time for that.Now Gintama is my favourite anime so you can guess what my answer would be but Im not going to say it. Instead Id suggest checking out this pageIts got episode numbers and short synopses alongside each one so you can at least decide for yourself which episodes sound like theyre worth watching.

It is weird though that Tsukuyo and Yoshiwara have been left out of this final conflict for a while. I know Sorachi has some shit planned.,Gintama,db98n34,3,t5_2sc2h
10019210,0,t1_dbdgfas,Considering the narrative structure Sorachi uses in his manga while Gintoki is a recurring protagonist of the whole story every lesson or arc the protagonist changes. Sometimes the protagonist can be changed during the course of the arc  in the first part of SA arc the protagonist was Zenzou while in the second part it was Gintoki. Thats why it feels like everyone is important  because everyone has their own time to shine during certain arcs  this especially applies to Hijikata who has the huge amount of centrics.But if are looking for recurring deuteragonists its definitely Shinpachi and Kagura. Both of them serve as deuteragonists in a different way though.Shinpachi serves as a narrator and has a lot of screen time due to his staright man routine but at the same time his character does not have as much focus as of late his last character arc was Beam Saber which he shared with his sister.Kagura is the direct opposite  she rarely serves as a narrator but like Gintoki she is central to the recurring plot Yato plotline she has her own foil Kamui she participates a lot in Gintokis antics during comedy arcs while Shinapchi mostly reacts to them and she even has influence on other characters especially on Okita  he is the only character whose arc was not directly influenced by Gintoki  every time he has an important character moment its either Shinsengumi or Kagura who are there for him.,Gintama,dbdj51c,4,t5_2sc2h

10653818,0,t1_dde4zpk,Episode  is my favourite anime episode of all time simply because of the flashbacks I shed a couple of tears.In most long running anime such as Naruto Bleach One Piece DBZ etc. youd generally hate flashbacks during a fight scene because it takes so much away from it but BOY Gintama is different. The flashback to when they were children just made the fight x better because of the added emotion and feels to when Shouyosensei was killed.,Gintama,ddeuy4z,3,t5_2sc2h

11279160,0,t1_dfa8vax,I agree with you. Its not the majority opinion but the movie had a lot of pointless scenes from a storytelling perspective added to make fans happy squeezing the Shinsengumi in Kamui and Abuto making an appearance that doesnt actually make much sense in the storys sequence of events etc.The cuts are there theyre not huge but theyre there. And what annoyed me was how they cut down one of my fav. scenes from Benizakura when Takasugi turns around slowly and Kagura starts realizing shes in trouble.  I think most people will prefer the movie in the end though. Im just not one of them.,Gintama,dfah5pu,2,t5_2sc2h
11289609,0,t3_60wocg,How much of it is good writing? . Even with all the comedy there a LOTS of little pieces of foreshadowing world building and subtle character development.

This to me reminds her the way Kamui left Kagura and her mother to join the pirates and Kagura felt it again when Gin did that. ,Gintama,dgjtzck,1,t5_2sc2h
