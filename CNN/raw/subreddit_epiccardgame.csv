Singleton Palace GuardFrost Giant feel like they could be focused one way or the other maybe ditching singleton Angel for x Giants to support a little more for Sage. This would give you the option for Arcane Research in Muses slot might be helpful to remove reanimation targets or dig for answers. ,epiccardgame,d3d4erg,3,t5_38i6z
7689949,0,t3_4kmya4,Ueomeyr has a good breakdown. Theres a really helpful flow chart on Board Game Geek that breaks down the flow of the game well. Ill post a link once I get to work. Some advanced detailsThe blocker and attacker choose how they deal their damage. So if I attack with a  and you double block it with a  and a  I can distribute the damage however I want.  and   and  or  and  if I want or even  and . Same for blocking a double attack. Breakthrough is a bit tricky with team attacking but it makes sense. Pretty much you subtract defense from possible breakthrough damage before applying other damage. A  breakthrough attacking with a  non breakthrough that is blocked by a  doesnt deal breakthrough damage to your opponent. This ties into the below.Another thing to note if you double attack your champions can be blocked by  champion and they are grounded to the lowest ability. So if you team attack with an airborne and a non airborne the total attack can be blocked by a non airborne.,epiccardgame,d3gaqfm,2,t5_38i6z
8078234,0,t3_4pr29i,As a company we dont have the resources to get into every online nook and cranny.  Were still pretty small and our time is taken up with making awesome games where gorillas punch minotaurs in the face and dinosaurs are eating minotaurs and minotaurs are dying to horrible horrible magic.I swing by Reddit because I like Reddit but its usually when I have downtime.  Its not technically part of my job.  I just really hate minotaurs.,epiccardgame,d4o2hme,3,t5_38i6z
8982665,0,t3_53b0hz,Hello and welcome to Epic!I got into it for the very same reasons you stated. This game is very good but needs more supporters for sure. Im struggling to find players in Las Vegas.To answer your questions Yes all Kickstarter promo cards are illegal until they are sold via retail by White Wizard Games. Kickstarter backers received  extra cards per faction  Total and  demigodEldergod cards. Atm all of these cards have not been put into anything retail. From various comments on BGG it seems future expansions or new sets will contain these cards. My guess is they may even have new artwork by the time they see a retail release. Currently the retail cards are limited to Epic base set and the EpicTyrants expansion.Demigod cards most likely will follow a similar release but are not actual cards but more a format. You could easily look up these cards and rules to play without having the actual demigod cards. When playing with these cards you the player and youre opponent receive once per turn abilities. Each demigod also has a suggested deck list.Funny story I literally just acquired  copies of all Kickstarter promos and demigod cards earlier today! I have not yet played them myself but it looks to be another fun addition to the game and I look forward to the promo cards being retailed. Go on boardgamegeek.com for a stronger community. The developers of the games tend to post comments clarifying and hinting at new announcements.Also be sure to take a look at White Wizard Games official site. It lists every single card and many supplemental information regarding rules AND... printable tokens!Enjoy the game!,epiccardgame,d7rkuau,4,t5_38i6z

10469220,0,t1_dctfwvf,I agree. For the most part the game play seemed to be about letting you make any valid play as opposed to making the  selection automatically. For example when Rob had several triggers at the same time he had the choice to order them. Many were free and had no decisions when would I not want to gain  life?. Where this Star Realms many would be handled with no user interaction.The fact that game instantly passed seems like a big diversion from that philosophy of allowing any valid play no matter how rarely you would want to not take the logical decision. This case there is no real decision but there is information to be gained in how you make that decision.,epiccardgame,dcuskg4,2,t5_38i6z
