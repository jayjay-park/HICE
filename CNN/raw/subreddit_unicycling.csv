639082,0,t3_21gcju,I can help you! I own a Nimbus Signature Trials unicycle. The Impact and Nimbus unicycles you mentioned are very very similar and you cant go wrong with either. Most people like the handle on the Nimbus much better. It is the same handle as on Kris Holm unicycles. It is extremely comfortable and is not prone to injuring fingers like so many other handles. The cranks on the Impact are slightly better than the cranks on the Nimbus. Also if I remember correctly the cranks on the Impact are  mm with is better for trials and the cranks on the Nimbus are about  mm which is better for streets and flatland. Also the frame of the impact might be slightly better because occasionally I hit my knees on the vertical portion of the Nimbus frames crown. It looks like the Impact frame wont have this problem. And both models weigh the exact same so weight isnt an issue. You cant go wrong with either model. If you do decide to go with the Impact consider ordering a Kris Holm handle I think it will fit but you should double check. Also another unicycle to consider is the Koxx One Devil which is sold on Renegade Juggling. A lot of people say that this is a superior unicycle. However the company that makes it is no longer in business so there arent a lot of places you can find this brand. I hope I was helpful! Btw is this upcoming plane ride for Unicon  in Montreal? If so see you there. ,unicycling,cgcwxed,6,t5_2rf91

893497,0,t1_cgywm5o,The same length cranks will feel different on a  than a . There is more mass to move and more distance to go for the wheel with the same leverage on the pedals.My muni came with mm cranks which felt ok but a bit awkward almost. When I changed to mm it felt like that gave me better control and a smoother ride I am now using mm which feels a lot faster but I also feel like I have less control. On the plus side I am getting much better with my static mounts on the mm cranks than I was on my mm cranks.,unicycling,ch5uf3g,1,t5_2rf91

1796198,0,t3_2f3fsu,Hard to tell from a photo but I suspect bike shop guy is right.That appears to be Meccanostyle Schwinn which I presume is a cheap uike which seems to be borne out by the other visible components so I think you have three main options . Go with bike shop guy and let him rethread it for you. Outcomes unknown but the worst case is you permanently break your cheapo uni.. Get a new axle and have bike shop guy rebuild the wheel. Axles go from dirtcheap to stupid. This will be the most reliable fix but certainly not the cheapest and Im not at all sure the rest of the uike is worth the expenditure.. Get bike shop guy to weld the crank back on. Irreversible  which could be a ballache if you strip the pedal thread in the same crank  but a quickndirty fix and its only a cheap uni so the worst case is the same as point .,unicycling,ck5k5fa,2,t5_2rf91

6797795,0,t3_48tbm5,It doesnt matter. Seat height would be most important for comfort but in my mind the main reason to go for a bigger wheel is to go faster. The bigger the wheel the faster it rolls. Therefore   StreetFlatlandTrials.  Entry size into Muni.  great for Downhill muniFaster single track. I love my er for fast cross country and commuting. and finally  for full on road riding most comparable to a bicycle rolling speed.Im about  and I learned to ride on a tiny  wheel. I upgraded because going that slow was super tiring for the distances I was rolling. plus I broke it.If youre trying to decide what to buy think most about what youd like to do with it as your skills develop. Its kind of like deciding between a BMX Mountain bike or a Road bike. ,unicycling,d0mtlqg,4,t5_2rf91

9306247,0,t3_57v4y4,Is it possible that sitting on the saddle upright hurts and this causes you to lean a little more sideways? You dont have to answer that just bringing it to your attention. I used to ride a bike like that because the saddle hurt.,unicycling,d8vmu2x,1,t5_2rf91

9997553,0,t1_dapfpea,I was able to ride half a block in about  hours of practice and down the street  hours of practice practicing  hour a day.I started off in a hallway for the first few days so I could use both walls to balance. Then I moved to a fence. I rode along the fence for a few yards until it ends and kept riding as far as I could. I recommend using a side walk or something not too wide so you have incentive to ride straight. Time and effort is the best way to learn and you will naturally get it as long as you are actively trying.,unicycling,dbapk8t,1,t5_2rf91
10183398,0,t3_5lqbpg,Most giraffe unicycle riders Ive seen usually have people helping them up and down.  Either holding the uni still while they climb up amp down or having some kind of raised platform to get onoff.Riding should be as normal but youre probably dealing with a gear and chain so if theyre not at the proper tension you might be experiencing more play than normal.,unicycling,dbycewz,1,t5_2rf91

10286486,0,t1_dca12o9,gt As WillieFastuWillieFast already explained the slash means its a dualhole crank so you can have the pedals at a shorter or longer crank length depending on the type of riding.    For the stock crank lengths I dont think any of those are ideal. And I dont think you need to pay the extra  for the Kris Holm Spirits. Theyre nice but its overkill for your purposes.    So I would really recommend calling UDC and chatting with whoever picks up Josh or Amy and see if they can rig you up a stock  Nimbus with the mm Venture cranks that I think are in stock right now. I dont think theyll make you pay an extra fee for the crank switch but dont quote me on that. Plus theyre nice people and its always fun to chat. ulifeofajenni,unicycling,dca12s3,1,t5_2rf91

11052511,0,t1_dekj1s3,Locked together. And we have to control our torques to work together and not against each other. This is a big problem when you start to learn riding the tandem unicycle. When you ride a normal unicycle feeling a torque means you are out of balance or there is some disturbance from an uneven road surface. In both cases you have to react with a countertorque. In case of  the tandem unicycle the perceived torque can also be caused by your partner. And in this case do not react with a countertorque. And the hard part Learn to distinguish between both.,unicycling,deks7bt,3,t5_2rf91
