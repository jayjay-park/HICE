6807320,0,t3_48uyjf,Some of these may not work for everybody but the ones that have not given me any problems are Bean sprouts Bell peppers Carrots Chile peppers Cucumbers Eggplant Green beans Kale amp other greens Lettuce Potatoes Radishes Scallions green part Spinach Summer squash Turnips ZucchiniI also do ok with small amounts of broccoli cabbage celery mushrooms and tomatoes.My favorite ways to get a good serving of veggies are Cut big chunks of potatoes bell pepper carrots amp zucchini. Toss in a little bit of olive oil and season with marjoram rosemary thyme salt and lots of black pepper. Roast at  for  minutes flipping every  minutes so they dont stick too badly or until theyre good and browned and cooked through. You can roast green beans the same way as above but they cook much quicker so keep an eye on them. Its my favorite way to eat them. Theyre really good with a little parmesan cheese too. Fried rice with carrots scallions and zucchini egg and whatever meat I have on hand. I eat a lot of fried rice. I also really like veggiestuffed twicebaked potatoes. Bake or microwave some potatoes and while those are going saut down some spinach zucchini and bell peppers. Hollow out the potatoes and mix the scooped out filling with the veggies and some chicken or bacon or shrimp or whatever sounds good plus a little butter and shredded cheddar or parmesan. Pop them back in the oven or under the broiler until they get brown on top. These make great leftovers. An easy quick side dish that I make a lot is just sauted zucchini and spinach with garlicinfused olive oil.  Tacos amp quesadillas are really good with bell pepper scallions and zucchini sauted with generous amounts of cumin paprika cayenne cilantro and black pepper.  You cant go wrong with a good salad. Lettuce spinach cucumbers carrots radishes bell peppers tomatoes if you can have them boiled egg chicken bacon shredded cheddar spicy mustard vinaigrette.  Or a nicoisestyle salad with lettuce tuna boiled egg green beans boiled potatoes tomatoes kalamata olives and a good vinaigrette.I hope any of that helps! I try to find creative ways to sub ingredients in regular recipes and it helps to get some variety so the diet doesnt feel too restricted.,FODMAPS,d0nwm11,2,t5_2sxvy
6829595,0,t1_d0qescl,Including veggie sushi the only reason why one couldnt live on sushi is the price. You can get the short grain rice and toasted nori the seaweed wrapper stuff at any Asian market and many conventional groceries in the international section to make your own though. I dont know if Id recommend doing fish sushi at home but I used to make mushroom or avoandcarrot all the time. For low fodmap veggie sushi you can do tofu and carrot cucumber bell peppers if your into it lettuce or spinach smaller amounts of zuchinni whatever wont set you off. I bet zuchinni and carrot would be a great flavor combo actually.,FODMAPS,d0qfo1y,3,t5_2sxvy

7786918,0,t1_d3qluq8,It can be. The problem is that FODMAP carb intolerancefermentation is relative to your gut bacteria profile  certain populations will ferment more undigested carbs than others in various quantities and create different gasses as a byproduct. Its not a very well understood area yet unfortunately so there is a lot of trial and error.E.g I have problems with long fiber chains more than polyols some folks are the other way around. Theres quite a lot of variation across peoples optimal low FODMAP diet hence the advice that people should relax and adjust from the base diet once they establish a baseline.You might find your reactions change after antibiotics whether temporarily or long term or infection.,FODMAPS,d3rb0sb,3,t5_2sxvy

8426961,0,t1_d5uvltl,I will take it if it means I can enjoy some scampi! lol Yeah I was told to be on the diet for at least  weeks to see a full result. I am almost positive it will work. I will be honest I am not the best eater and have a sweet tooth. In the same respect I have also kicked everything to the curb and went dry just to figure it out.

8589638,0,t3_4xcblk,Everyone here with FODMAP issues please get a hydrogen breath test for bacteria overgrowth.  Almost always its a GI infection.Many years ago my wife was diagnosed with IBS and told itd be for life.  I called bullshit and got her some tests that showed it was an GI infection.  Doctors dont seem to want to treat IBS but every person whos come to me with this issue turned out to have a GI infection often Candida.Antibiotics antifungal medication and a heavy dose of probiotics over time can get rid of it but its a stubborn affliction.  ,FODMAPS,d6falll,3,t5_2sxvy
8714642,0,t3_4zdmw2,I usually try to find a dish that isnt a mixture of ingredients where FODMAPS can easily hide and cannot be customized eg. pastas casseroles risottos etc. Any dishes with a simple protein and a side of veggies is the easiest because the restaurant can easily remove any FODMAP ingredients. For example there is a salmon dish with side veggies at one of my favorite restaurants.  I ask them to cook the salmon with oil salt and pepper only.  Same with the veggies and I have them sub veggies I can eat if they arent on my diet already.  I do the same with chicken or steak dishes. With salads I ask for any protein to be cooked with salt and pepper only ask them to exclude any veggies I cant eat and ask for oil and vinegar for dressing.  A hamburgers with a gluten free bun is usually safe for me.  I get it with no onions and no sauce or just mayo.  Also sushi and sashimi are always a safe bet.  Ive found customizing something to fit my diet is much easier than trying to find something in the menu that meets all the requirements. Its a little tricky at first but once I got the hang of it I can usually find something at most restaurants.,FODMAPS,d6uyv03,3,t5_2sxvy
9454592,0,t3_5a680f,Does beer actually affect you? According to most guides Ive read and that Im currently following beer is pretty OK. Alcohol in general fuck me up to a moderate degree but beer is better than any kind of drink mix and wine. Try GF beers.

10386833,0,t3_5oqaz7,I make garlic and onion infused ghee and keep it refrigerated. basically make a pound of regular ghee or start with it if you can find it locally. rough chop half a medium yellow onion and  cloves of garlic into their own piles. get the ghee to low temp on your stovetop and toss in the onion. if needed bring the temp up slowly until the onions are bubbling so their water is cooking off and leave it there for about  minutes. drop in the chopped garlic and leave it for another  but keep an eye on it and stop if the garlic starts to brown. then filter through cheesecloth and store.  this is acceptable for my tolerance. if you are more sensitive to onions run the hot ghee through a paper filter like a coffee filter to remove finer particulate matter before storing. it has to be pretty hot so it doesnt solidify on the filter blocking filtration. I recommend setting up the filter in something microwave safe so if things chill too much you can pop it in the microwave for  seconds to get things flowing again.,FODMAPS,dcleuoe,3,t5_2sxvy
