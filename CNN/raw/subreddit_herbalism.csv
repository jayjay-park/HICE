1060869,0,t1_chov5ky,I see. I think im going for stone since porcelain looks very fragile... The tricky part will be getting it since I do not know any mexican marketnot buying in Chinese shops since they arent known for selling high quality things if you know what I mean...in LisbonI study thereand next to my area.Since it is made of stone isnt there a risk of the stone to shatter into smaller fragments as I grind making the products get full of them? Just curious. ,herbalism,choviix,1,t5_2qy4h

3091759,0,t1_coeq0vs,I would love it if I could do this but it isnt an option for everyone. I have very limited space and I share it with a cat who thinks his sole purpose on earth is to destroy every plant so growing stuff not so much an option. I can grow a few things on my own but not nearly everything I would want. Plus I dont know how to make all the things even if I had the plants sometimes its just easier and safer one would hope to buy someone elses work. Having corporations actively deceiving people hurts everyone. ,herbalism,coigjuf,1,t5_2qy4h
6174435,0,t3_400jm2,Sending you good vibes!! This is more nutrition oriented than herbal but I would suggest eating things high in anthocyanins. Wild blueberries are very high in this constituent.  Bilberry is as well but youll get more bang for your buck just eating a cup of wild blueberries everyday. Hawthorne may also be worth exploring. ,herbalism,cyrgx0g,3,t5_2qy4h

10116769,0,t3_5ki6ru,I will sometimes look things up in pubmed  for instance that was where I found good info on elderberry for colds and flu and vitex for menstrual issues. It doesnt always have everything and some herbs may be too obscure but its a good place to start if you are looking for healthrelated studies.,herbalism,dbq8166,1,t5_2qy4h
