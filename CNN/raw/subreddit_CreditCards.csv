6262477,0,t1_cz1gikb,No problem!  Both these cards are relatively easy. Ive heard that Chase prefers at least one year of history while Citi is a bit sensitive to inquiries when you start out.  However those are both pretty general rules since I eked out a Freedom at  months of history. No clue how but its possible.I suggest waiting til you reach one year of history with your CU card.  By doing that youll give the chance for the credit bureaus to remove the records of those AU cards some may report as closed but theyll stay on your report for a month or two until they disappear.  In addition waiting would remove the relatively minimal negative impact of past inquiries but you shouldnt have too many at this point yet.   Good luck!,CreditCards,cz1h2st,2,t5_2qmhl

6427231,0,t3_43q1w6,Inactivity can hurt your score but only a very minor amount you shouldnt lose sleep over it.You should look into the terms amp conditions for your credit card to see if they mention anything about inactivity.  Ive heard of inactive accounts being closed but that must be a rarity.  Check the terms amp conditions of your card or simply call up the member services hotline.  A closed account will have a much more pronounced affect on your credit score.Freezing an individual credit card depends on who issued it.  If the issuer e.g. bank doesnt have any kind of mechanism to freeze your account the best you can do is just put away the card and maybe setup an emailtext alert when ANY transaction e.g. any purchase over  is made.  Ive found this to be a common alert option with credit cards.,CreditCards,czk43c9,2,t5_2qmhl

7361505,0,t3_4g69cd,. A balance reduces your credit score while you hold it. As soon as you pay off your balance that affect will be removed. The effect of the balance is usually very low or negligent at low levels of balance  of your total credit available being used but gets much worse as you get closer to your credit limit.. Holding a balance does nothing to improve your credit score long term. The two things you have to do are anever have any late payments and bhave a long credit history with different types of creditcardsetc.Deciding to hold a balance should be a decision about your actual financial situation not a decision about your credit score.

8027900,0,t1_d4ibfy4,wow! thanks for the awesome write up.sadly Im not sure if Ill be able to hit the bonus point for my AMex.  weeks before signing up for it I had a  purchase that wouldve easily covered the bonus requirement. However I dont foresee myself spending that much money in the near future. To your th point thats good to know. Ive been doing research on AMex cards and just like you said they tend to focus heavily on traveling. I wanted an Amex card just because it seemed nice to diversify from my visa or mastercard. But looking back this isnt my investment portfolio...so I should be focused on the benefits of the card and not the label on the plastic. With that in mind I think that Ill probably ask to downgrade the  card is that possible? I havent looked into it yet once the year is up. Its nice to have the k limit for large purchases since its a limit that I know I most likely wont be able to get right off the bat if I signed up for a new CC with another provider. Ill also look into the cards you mentioned for the large purchases. That may prove to be extremely helpful!I really appreciate it!,CreditCards,d4iet9c,1,t5_2qmhl

With a  credit score youre going to mostly be looking at secured cards not a bad idea but they wont increase your available credit much over what you have with the QS.One option to consider is the Amazon Store Card.

9537857,0,t3_5bifvr,It means you can spend up to  before having to pay them some money. Periodically they will raise your limit as long as you make on time payments and keep a good credit history for me they raised my limit after  months and then  months after that.Your statements will come once a month and whatever you owe on the card will then be due by the due date on the statement. You can then pay the amount in full which is the best thing to do. You will not owe them any interest and not carrying a balance will help your credit credit utilization is taken into account. The minimum payment is if you dont want to pay the full amount. You have to make at least the minimum payment every statement or you will likely get a late payment strike on your credit. If you make just the minimum payment you will then owe the remaining balance plus interest. You said your interest rate right now is  but once the  months is up it will likely jump to somewhere around  so making just the minimum payment will cost you quite a bit of money in the future.,CreditCards,d9oqmsh,2,t5_2qmhl
