Our household just switched from  DVRs to the DVR Plus which cut our bill by  a month.  We can watch recorded shows from any room with a cable box and we can record up to  shows at a time.

2397990,0,t1_cm7rfyr, and my wife is  and we basically marathoned the first  seasons in a week. Good story lines and character development. If I could levy any complaints about the show...we havent watched season  yet so maybe some of this is no longer accurate The production value seems low. Maybe this will improve if the show continues to be a financial success? Subpar acting. Or maybe I just havent watched any prime time dramas in a while. But especially supporting roles the widow who is all over Walt they guy who runs the tribal council sorry cant remember their names right now. Honestly Walt and Ferg are the only characters who nail it and dont appear to be acting at all in my opinion Whats up with Lou Diamond Phillips dialogue? I cant stand how we wont use contractions. Always saying can not instead of cant. Is this an attempt at authenticity of how Native Americans speak? Also LDP has some acting chops but they dont show up in this show.,netflix,cm83l8a,2,t5_2qoxj
2408020,0,t1_cm9bzgv,Completely agree. Putting ads in the middle of content could get awkward especially if its automated. Being at some pivotal intense scene that all of a sudden cuts to an ad for McDonalds would be frustrating. That said every show is made with ads in mind. For example I believe HBO doesnt have ads right? But they know that not every international territory is going to have HBO in their country and who they sell the local rights to might need to have ads so theyll still follow that basic structure but its a lot more hidden than a show that actually does have ads.But yeah like you said if they had an ad at the start and an ad at the end it wouldnt be the worst especially if they were skippable after five or so seconds.,netflix,cm9c99o,1,t5_2qoxj

3287560,0,t1_cp2ylpo,I see your logic but I have more than a little knowledge of the FBIs Internal Fiction Detection System and can illuminate what is going on in more detail.All FBI internal fiction requests are routed through a local detection system set up in each fictional office and put through a number of sequential checks. The first check is if the requester is in the credits of the show or not. If not their request passes through. If yes then the request is passed to the viewpoint module which checks to see if the requester is currently a viewpoint character. If they are then then the request is checked for drama level. If the drama level is higher than a predetermined cutoff point then one of a random number of different blocks are placed on the request depending on what scary screens the art department has pregenerated at the time.Note that this system was originally developed for the CTU and proved so successful there it was later rolled out to the FBI all in  hours with only  techs being tortured and one city shot to hell in order to get the job done in that time.

4294429,0,t1_crsjkyi,Why would it not? In the time spent avoiding watching the ad I could click on a torrent and already be watching it since you can stream torrents. You even have say it would be not that bad. Which means you acknowledge it is something bad. Its just an annoyance that serves me absolutely no purpose. Im already paying for the service so showing more shows does not in any way get you more money. And I already know about what other shows I might want to watch because thats a service they already offerwhen I specifically ask for it and not while Im trying to watch something else.In fact doing it with first party ads makes less sense than third party ones. At least third party ads get you more money.  Thats why people assume this is just a stepping stone to first party ads which would actually serve a purpose for Netflix. Of course most people would rather pay the extra  cents than watch a months worth of ads so third party ads are still stupid.The only reason why people use Netflix is that it is more convenient than torrents or illegal streaming sites. You inconvenience people they are going to want to go elsewhere.I already dont use any other service because of adsunless my adblock can successfully get rid of them.,netflix,cs9pdax,1,t5_2qoxj

I would browse through the list open anything that I found interesting in a new tab and then look through the tabs to decide what I should watch. The new interface doesnt seem to allow this. If you click on a show it just expands the options for that show unless you click on the wrong place then it just starts playing that show. I then need to browse back and it kicks me to the top of the page instead of where I was.The icons for the shows are even smaller then they were. I have a TV thats connected to a computer and thats how I watch the majority of my Netflix. I could barely see the writing on the descriptions of the shows before the redesign now its all but impossible.

They have a couple competitors here foxtel and two other internet streaming services but I dont think they really compare at all. I have no doubt in time netflix will push forward though marketing wise the others are pushing hard I cant imagine them holding onto that share of the market for too long given how quick netflix is expanding. Itll likely be easier for content creators to just give rights to netflix in many places instead of dealing with netflix in america and others in Aus. ,netflix,ct5rdwc,0,t5_2qoxj

4712419,0,t1_cto6mb1,Part of me thought that other companies were using some deceptive PR to make it seem like there was a huge outcry. I mean who measures how massive a public outcry is? I dont think if they are mail sent to Netflix that it would be Netflix telling everyone. It seems like it comes down to just bloggers and journalists. Frankly the blogosphere can have ideas spread like a virus very quickly and from unreliable sources. Journalists even pick up stories from blogs or reddit and print them as real news I saw this happen this week with a story on Metal Gear Solid of all things Vlog said something it was summarized on a Reddit post and a lot of journalism websites began to run the story. The Vlogger in question eventually addressed how everything was misinterpreted and that he was never even contacted about the information he was shared etc.So what stops major companies from planting little seeds like that? Im not delving into conspiracy here but I imagine it has been researched pretty well. With their resources they could have a few voices say what they want and then watch the it spread.I dunno its just an idea. I see outrages on the internet a lot that I dont really feel are actually as felt as they say they are. But they eventually influence people to think that that IS what people are feeling and that they should feel the same way too.Maybe?,netflix,ctojf72,2,t5_2qoxj

Just look at how Amazon have had to limit Prime sharing now the streaming service can be shared.

Blocking people from accessing other regions is counterproductive to this goal. This is also why they dont care if people share their password either.

If Netflix goes ahead with this it will see an immense rise in un subscription from customers throughout the world as people only use Netflix because they can use their same account to access different libraries especially when they travel abroad.

I can see in the future a service that provides on demand choices with live events.  For example lets say there is a company called StreamSports and they buy the rights to televise NBA games.  They could have an NBA selection you pick that shows all active live streams for games that day which updates automatically.Bulls vs Heat doesnt start til  the icon could be there with small identifier that it is not livescheduled later.  You click on it and something says This game is scheduled to start at  or whatever.  Then at the specified time the stream starts which you can enterleave at any time.  A service like this could still offer on demand choices for past games sport documentaries etc.  This could even be content on a general streaming service that could exist or an existing one today.,netflix,d0m5yc6,2,t5_2qoxj

If you feel like experimenting try the free version since it has all protocols and options see if that works. If so then Pro will work. Then see if PPTP does what you need it to at your gym. Keep testing peeling back the layers till you reach what Basic has to offer. If everything seems to work then Basic should do you fine. But if you want a no fuss set it and forget it experience after seeing that the free trial did what you wanted just go with Pro. ,netflix,d0sha8u,1,t5_2qoxj

A measly customer service representative cannot possibly speak on behalf of the company as a whole nor can you sue on behalf of any incorrect information a customer service rep may have presented. If the original rep was incorrect it is still YOUR FAULT for not reading the terms and conditions properly and not understanding what you were signing up for. If you want some sort of guarantee reach out to the Netflix headquarters by mail not calling some measly customer service rep who is there to help you understand how to sign uphow Netflix worksactual App issuespoint out that your internet is just not running well.  I am no legal expert but I just looked up the Netflix Terms of Service which I guarantee that guy did not read and spent  seconds to find thisYOU AND NETFLIX AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further unless both you and Netflix agree otherwise the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one persons claims with your claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that partys individual claim.If I am reading this correctly doesnt this say you cannot file a class action suit against Netflix? AKA stop crying about your  dollars that you dont want to pay. Dont pay it. Netflix has way better content than it used to and gee I wonder what the price change years ago was for. Additionally why would you need a classaction suit against Netflix? The only ones who would ever need to sue would be some big studio whose rights were infringed upon if that ever happened and... that wouldnt be a classaction lawsuit. Baloney. ,netflix,d4uyeco,1,t5_2qoxj

I checked over at Amazon and they dont even have The Civil War as part of the streaming with prime. You have to buy each individual episode. You can however watch The West with a Prime subscription. I dont have one so it doesnt help me out.I think the only Ken Burns documentary left on Netflix is The Roosevelts series that aired on PBS last year. Im irritated that two days ago they showed MacGyver being renewed well they removed the expiration date anyway and then they removed it today anyway. Guess their deal with CBS Distribution is over and you can only watch them at Prime and CBS All Access.Pretty soon all that will be left on Netflix is their original content which I feel like is exactly the way they want it ,netflix,d4vlyx7,2,t5_2qoxj

8390149,0,t1_d5q62e5,They can do it with something like Orphan Black in the UK because with the move to take BBC online only they passed on any bought in content so it no longer had a broadcaster as its not a big enough hit for any of the UK channels. If you dont have a broadcaster in a country it also kills any real chance of selling DVDs or digital downloads In the US though BBC Amercia commisioned the show and as they are funding the majority of the production costs they want to be able to fully exploit to get their moneys worth so Netflix cant get access until the primary window has expired.

Someone has to handle and make sure that tax money gets paid to the government. So who pays for that extra expensive. We do. Its not much of course but in Netflix or Amazons case they are doing business in the state in one way. They have a shop online that we visit and buy from. They arent IN the state.

Those with cable get to see it first because they are paying for that privilege those of us who are cordcutters just have to wait a measly   months to watch it and those who have cable but missed it can catch up in the  months before the next season. Wish more shows did this because the problem when they dump a previous season just before the new one starts is that sometimes you dont have enough time to catch up unless you want to binge the whole thing in a week and for many of us we just dont have that kind of time.

9870534,0,t1_datxdat,Not every show they create can be a hit or have big name starsbrands attached. They probably get hundreds or thousands of pitches like any other network and have to whittle it down to what they think can work. A few all around quality shows that have mass appeal some mediocre shows in certain genres to fill out their lineup and then some niche shows.  Netflix is probably the only place where a show like Stranger things is possible or where you can bring someone back from retirement like Dave Chappelle and give him the full creative control that appeals to him. No is forcing you to watch the shows you dont like. Sure doubling their content means more mediocre and niche shows but it also means some great shows as well. Netflix has only been doing this for  years now and they already have a strong lineup which leads them to be compared to HBO and not the alphabetical networks. In fact if I did have to compare them to a network I would say they are most like USA with some SyFy mixed in,netflix,dau5j9x,4,t5_2qoxj

11229708,0,t3_60998m,What utter selfserving BULLSHIT.Popcorn began as a snack that was purchased outside the theaters most didnt have the ventilation needed to cook popcorn from vendors on the street. The Great Depression is what pushed theaters to install poppers and cut out the middle man the innovation that Reed Hastings belittles.What have theaters done since the mids to improve the theater experience?  Air conditioning Wide screen films both standard . and wider . to . Stereo sound Convert almost entirely to color excepting artistic choice. Instituted film ratings which allowed filmmakers to break the Hayes Code for content. IMAX Switched over to stadium seating in every new cinema built for the last  years. Installed better seating much of it intended for couples like moveable armrests. Are currently introducing reserve seating and advanced tickets sales. Installing bars amp cafes serving full meals both of which can be carried into the auditoriums. Or brought to you. Many of these innovations were spurred by the competition from television. So Netflix is simply the latest iteration of the boob tube which will no doubt motivate theater owners to add other features to improve the cinemagoers experience. UPDATE And Reed why dont you clean your own glass house before throwing rocks at others.... Give Netflix users ADVANCE monthsweeks notice of titles that are expiring.  Give users advance notice of upcoming titles and WHEN so we dont waste money renting them. Allow users to disable recommendations Easily hide user history.  Set recommendation parameters  namely exclude every showfilm below a certain suggested rating.  Hide all films that were direct to video oh but that would make your content library plummet wouldnt it?,netflix,df4vf4v,42,t5_2qoxj

I did watch the leather special in its entirely.  Me and the wife occasionally thow on standup comedy when we have time off together.  It was really not funny.

Nope. Im triggered and putting my money where my mouth is. This move is so transparent I had to do something responsive to the insult.

As Netflix have said there is a disconnect between enjoyment and quality look at IMDB ratings for something like Sharknado. It has . average but lots of poeple seem to love it hence why its about to have it th outing. No matter how much people like it its never going to get ratings towards the upper end because the production values are low and its cheesy so it doesnt matter how enjoyable people find it its going to take a ratings hit. There are other things that production wise are quality but you may not personally enjoy as much if at all but the quality of the production will get it a boost. So even if everyone did rate and tried to do it in a consistent manner its not going to be a reflection of enjoyment. Asking what you enjoy and then weighting it with the meta data it collects when you watch things allows for a better representation of the type of content you like that isnt influenced by other nonenjoyment factors ,netflix,dg66tzg,1,t5_2qoxj

If you give Office  stars and Friends  stars do you think it would be able to predict whether or not you like parks and rec now? The problem with the  star system exists between the keyboard and the desk. Netflix has years of data of people rating documentaries  stars and shitty comedies  stars and then watching the comedies over and over again while never watching the documentary. And its not consistent  some people rate  stars for everything and some rate  stars for everything. They will probably get more useful information from the likedont like system than  stars because people will use it properly.

11799380,1,t1_dgxczfk,Life is far too short to let bad entertainment permeate.Simply put this is post modern propaganda falsely representing itself as social commentary. The show represents equity as equality the supporting characters are all unrealistic tropes the show paints a segregated society as depicted as it were allegedly the same society we live in and generally speaking there is a shocking divide of intellectual capacity far below what is normal characters in this show are generally speaking fucking morons. It fails as a show and the message itself is quixotically hateful and divisive. If you seriously dont believe me when I say its hateful and divisive I want to to exercise one moment of clarity and answer this question as truthfully as you can Are people reacting to this show in a divided manner?That is not a loaded question. Youre personal subjectivity can stretch the concept of divided but at some level you have to admit that the answer is undoubtedly yes. Just because its the conservatives that are mad yes theyre assholes most of the time doesnt mean the shows message is meritorious. If the show succeeded on its premise conservatives would be more likely to give the show a honest chance to alter the opinions. People would come together. No thank you I want no part of it. This is a genuinely bad show poorly written at best and the message is one I cant even support because of the damage this does to my belief that reconciliation and acceptance is the path of unity. Also its paced like shit and edited by a gorilla with two scissors. ,netflix,dgxi0wf,1,t5_2qoxj

11803159,0,t3_68cd6w,I quite often download Netflix shows even though I pay for Netflix. I find the Plex ui much better and I can manage my episodes easier. The Netflix auto play pisses me off and there is no next episode view like in plex. I dont feel bad about it since I pay for a sub. ,netflix,dgxxgh1,2,t5_2qoxj
