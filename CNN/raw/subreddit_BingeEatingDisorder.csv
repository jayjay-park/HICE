10620924,0,t3_5rz12n,Dont buy any junk food that you cant control yourself around to put at home. Get some veggies like spinach or miso soup in case you need a small snack or something. Youre less likely to binge on those and even if you eat a lot of those its still fine caloriewise. Get rid of junk food at home.,BingeEatingDisorder,ddbguqc,3,t5_33q99

10811642,0,t3_5uliv2,I recently started therapy for binge eating first thing they had me do was throw away my scale.  I have no idea what Im at now. Over the last  years each time I would reach a new s digit I would swear no more.  .  .  .  .  .  .I finally realized that restricting calories wasnt fixing the deeper issues and sought real help.

11281348,0,t3_60yknq,I didnt binge or even over eat! I left food behind after each of my  meals! I need to start recognising that the morning you wake up after a binge free day feels infinitely better than binge eating. ,BingeEatingDisorder,dfaq2zg,2,t5_33q99
11401952,0,t1_dfn1fa9,No I like to distinguish between overeating and binge eating.  A true binge has such a different feeling than eating an extra cookie or two.  Downgrading from binging to slightly more normal overeating is kind of a victory to me still as pathetic as that might sound. MaybeIjustfeelpathetic,BingeEatingDisorder,dfoeaz9,1,t5_33q99

11589411,0,t3_65a05p,I completely understand that feeling and Im sorry you had to deal with it recently . Sometimes it can be so hard and its such a viscous cycle. I hate my body and myself so I binge to try and feel better then I only end up feeling worse and Im not doing my body any favours by eating like that. Its so hard to keep control of it. There is one idea that Ive had but havent actually tried that may work for you. Its important to eat but I understand the fear that trying to eat healthy might lead to a binge. Have you ever heard of this thing called Soylent? Its basically like a food replacement drink that has basically everything you need. I thought about buying some of those because its not really food its not something to binge on. I thought it could be like the bingers equivalent of a nicotine patch. Like I said Ive never actually tried it but I thought I would throw the idea out there as something that could help you. If you DO try it definitely let me know how it works. And either way good luck in the days to come . I know it gets hard but it does get easier too. Its about balance and taking it a day at a time. ,BingeEatingDisorder,dg9o1ba,1,t5_33q99
