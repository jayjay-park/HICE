Since this is not on its face a taking it would have fall into the tricky category of regulatory takings. But this would not work here anyway because as far as I know there has to be some change in the law to even get into this area.tldr  sovereign immunity absolutely can prevent a tort claim and this has nothing to do with the Takings Clause.,badlegaladvice,cqw8w93,10,t5_2y6sh

5964426,0,t1_cy19h6k,First off while a love potion would be more effective here I feel that its too blunt to use in divorces because divorces almost always involve super complicated emotions and love potions just beat all those emotions into super strong infatuation. This can and in my experience often does lead to unpredictable consequences. Love potions are a sledgehammer when preventing a divorce requires a scalpel.I think King Beleth is a better choice for this client than Prince Sitri. While Prince Sitri is generally considered more powerful than King Beleth Sitris abilities lie more in the realm of provoking lust between two people and revealing their secrets. Of course I would need to know more about why the clients wife is seeking divorce but I dont think its very likely that a disappointing sex life is whats provoking her to seek a divorce. On the other hand Sitris powers of revealing secrets could be the key to stopping the divorce before it begins but I feel that would only be successful if Client and Wife can actually overcome whatever secrets will be revealed.King Beleth seems to be the better choice because he seems to be easier to summon and control and his powers seem to make people actually fall in love rather than lust. I think that if Beleth can make Wife and Client fall in love with each other again since they must have gotten married for a reason the divorce will delayed long enough for the kids to grow up. If were lucky it may permanently save the marriage.Therefore I would choose to summon King Beleth.,badlegaladvice,cy1gtx3,12,t5_2y6sh

Any private citizen can fully infringe your right to free speech on their property. If you demonstrate on my lawn I can have you arrested for it. Many naive or ignorant protesters find that out the hard way every year then moan and bitch about it online.If a property owner complains the police will usually be the ones to do the enforcing of the owners private property rights. Your free speech rights are not being unconstitutionally infringed by government when that happens.I dont know what happened in this case but the use of outside leaves open the question of where the guy actually was which leaves open the question of whose and what kind of property he was on.Likewise you cannot use the protection of public property to harass people on private property. You cant stand on a sidewalk and scream at people in their private homes or yards.Most laws really come down to some version of Wheatons Law Dont be a dick. If youd consider the conduct unacceptable if you were on the other end of it dont be too surprised if you discover that it happens to be illegal in some way. If often is.All that said thats entirely hypothetical. I dont know what happened here. If the mans lawfully preaching and the cop is responding to a complaint that someone was offended by the content of his speech Id assume that was protected as long as he wasnt being deliberately abusive or disruptive about it. Screaming at individual people for example. That can often be subjective but its fairly commonsensical. Most of us know a douchebag or troll when we see one. There are ways he could be otherwise lawful but out of line due to his conduct.The outside detail caught my attention because it suggests he could be on private property. But I think thats not very likely. I think its more likely that his conduct attracted attention.At the same time the officers use of offended suggests to me that the complaint was more about content and thats a very touchy area for anyone to go before running up against the First Amendment. Again all other considerations being satisfied. So Im definitely not taking sides here. I dont know anywhere near enough facts to form an informed view of the situation. Im just pondering the maybes.EDIT I could have written that better sorry. Yes I believe youre right about the trespass part. The private property owner does not need a specific reason to eject merely express the desire that you leave. In that case its got nothing to do with speech just you being there at all. However a private property owner can still call the cops on you for disturbing the peace harassing them or such even if youre not on their property. Crank calling would fall under that never mind the applicable communications laws. Throwing turds on someones lawn all those teenage hijinks. Probably even just standing there menacingly and staring.,badlegaladvice,czy9gv3,-10,t5_2y6sh

6605536,0,t1_d02fbik,Im being unnecessarily pedantic but it seems interesting to distinguish between them in this manner. gtexecuted upon opening the packaging and beginning to use the productWould the terms not have to be brought to the attention of the user prior to use in all of the examples?  So Im on your site and unbeknownst to me I breach several TOS conditions I am then shown the TOS and agree and from this point no further breach occurs. Is the prior still breach? How could I agree to adhere to terms I was not aware of? In the UK its pretty strict on matters of timing terms must be made available prior to agreement.The distinction between clickwrap and browsewrap in the UK would probably be expressed in terms of demonstrating the terms were brought to the attention of the offeree and the click accept signifies this that the terms are legal in nature legal intention and a willingness to be bound. The reason I say this it seems possible to me that a click at the top of the page above the TOS would be weaker to rely on it isnt so much the click as the fact youve had to scroll past all the legal shite?,badlegaladvice,d02kfug,3,t5_2y6sh

There was a tooprovocativelytitled article in the New Yorker or Atlantic called is science a scam and if you can get past the title it just sort of traced how science is presented as the linear march towards progress and understanding but all the mistakes and missteps and foolish conclusions are swept under the rug like planet Vulcan or eugenics.  Sort of like if you took Dred Scot and the other horrible legal decisions out of legal education it would look like its always correct and infallible which of course its not. Edit.

Her explanation was that writing involves more thought than speaking and so its one thing to say it accidentally but in writing you dont really have any excuse.

8170662,0,t1_d4x5g6v,gt As far as anyone including Edward Snowden knows the basic Tor protocol is sound.I think the devils in the details. We acknowledge that over a normal HTTP connection the server can log IP addresses and that those IP addresses can be correlated to real subscriber identities. But we also acknowledge that if the browser is configured by its defaults it will give up user agent information as well. And websites can be configured so that they get a lot more information from you through clientside resources like cookies CSS javascript flash previously visited sites screen resolution screen size OS loggedin social media accounts etc. Some websites actually gather location information for locationaware devices. A website that gathers this information from its visitors isnt really considered malware even if a lot of these techniques require the execution of code on the visitors computer without the visitors informed consent.So while the Tor protocol itself might be secure it matters what higherlayer protocols are running over that lowlayer connection. It doesnt matter what level of encryption youre using if the other party to the communication is the government and you type out a message that says My name is Alice and my address is  Main Street. In that case a warrant wouldnt be required.,badlegaladvice,d4yvrm9,1,t5_2y6sh

9169662,0,t3_55vg19,I dont think this is really badlaw just a poorlyexpressed  but basicallysound  point. The way I read it mikeisrelic is making a policy argumentpeople ought to be able to vote in whatever primary since their taxes fundthe primaries. When ghastlyactions says that courts have ruled against people having alegal right to vote in whatever primary this is correct but its alsocompletely irrelevant since courts arent authorities on which policies oughtto be adopted.Thus Anticept distinguishes between citing courts as an authority on what the law iswhich they accept as perfectly appropriate and citing courts as an authority onwhat the law ought to be which they rejectgt That walks dangerously close to an appeal to authority. In the end law isgt still made by people with opinions and the judges on the court are nogt different. Their experience may make them more qualified to frame the decisiongt within the context of law but that doesnt automatically make the argumentgt itself less valid because its still an opinion.gt If the prior poster said legally since tax payer ... THEN the argument isgt made less valid by the courts ruling because it crosses into interpretationsgt of law. But they did not they stated their opinion on the matter one that Igt too share.Emphasis mine. The poster clearly has in mind that they are talking aboutsomething other than an interpretation of law so that they are quite correct tothink that judges  whose expertise is precisely on the interpretation of law are an irrelevant authority. So they are in fact explicitly appreciative of thepoint that udoublefloat raises here.I think part of the issue is that while someone initially raised the question of what the legal basis for the suit is at some point some people got to talking about what the policy basis for demanding a right to open primaries is and it seems that not everyone in the linked discussion is on the same page.,badlegaladvice,d8ebmzu,5,t5_2y6sh
9287119,0,t3_57mtj7,Let me start by saying IANAL mostly here for the learning but this was too terrible to not bring up.Context A few weeks ago there started popping up reports in South Carolina or somewhere in that area of people dressed as clowns hanging out in the woods and scaringharassing kids. Over the weeks this has stretched to most of the country. In my local area Omaha Nebraska were reaching peak idiocy of this phenomenon Someone was arrested recently for threatening to dress up like a clown and shoot up a school I cannot find it but I think Ive seen some similar threats being made regarding other schools. Point is the local cops are not fucking around when it comes to people dressed like clowns messing with kids.Enter this article about two idiots who decided to dress like clowns drive down a residential neighborhood and get out to harass some kids in an attempt to scare them The police are called they decide if they catch the idiots theyll be charged with disorderly conduct. I dont know if Municode is a legitimate source on Omaha laws but its the first thing that comes when I search for disorderly conduct omaha that isnt about MMA but they cite the Omaha definition of Disorderly Conduct asgt It shall be unlawful for any person purposely or knowingly to cause inconvenience annoyance or alarm or create the risk thereof to any person bygt a Engaging in fighting threatening or violent conduct orgt b Using abusive threatening or other fighting language or gestures.So what the idiots did was almost definitely disorderly conduct they were trying to create alarm by acting threateningly and this is before bringing up the recent high profile threats involving people dressed as clowns. Now enter OLF. He initially claims in the title that arresting the clowns is a breach of civil rights but provides no reason to think that. His comments in defense of his position is pretty repetitive breaking down to two ideas both in his first commentgt Have fun proving that intent. What else are people not allowed to wear in public?So theres no intent and why are they going to arrest every clown every where and where does it stop?Regarding intent Im pretty sure the prosecution has to prove to a jury that the idiots intended to create alarm by dressing as clowns while harassing and trying to scare kids. Since there have already been people arrested for doing an illegal thing while dressed as a clown and that was fairly big news locally I think that would be pretty easy to prove actually. Aside from the whole was harassing kids thing.Also its not just dont dress like a clown in public. The problem is dressed like a clown while harassing people after a series of high profile incidents involving people dressed as clowns. ,badlegaladvice,d8t7jmd,14,t5_2y6sh

10665294,0,t1_ddfz7gq,Oh yeah.  I once had a sovereign citizen case involving a prison inmate.  He didnt want to cell outside his race so he stabbed his black cellmate so he could be moved to segregation.  He represented himself in the case charging him with felonious assault and having a weapon while in detention.  You should have seen the jurys faces when he argued in closing that he JimBob of the Family Doe natural man is not the person charged in the indictment that is his corporate entity.  There was something in there about the indictment naming him with all capital letters.  The State is a corporate entity.  His corporate entity is engaged in contractual relationships with the State but his physical entity has not therefore the State has charged the wrong entity.  Ergo he is not guilty.
