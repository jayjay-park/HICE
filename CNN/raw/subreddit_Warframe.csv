8649,0,t3_1u7s0f,Too much of a difference between supercharged gear and not and pretty much impossibility to get orokin reactors and catalysts. I can understand that devs want to make money but this is well.... pretty much pay to win. Started playing about a week ago almost instantly installed alert app on phone. Not a single alert rewarded things required to supercharge your gear or I missed it during sleep. I got a  discount for  day as login bonus and bought some. The difference in power from supercharging something is insane.  Also some mods are just too damn rare. Serration is one but its obtainable. But multishot for rifles? I have over  Tethys runs and nothing. These are too basic mods to be this rare. I can understand mods that say convert other ammo into one specific ammo type or some auras and corrupted mods to be rare  its not a must.,Warframe,ceff5it,1,t5_2urg0

38618,0,t1_ceio4sj,This discussion has been had indepth in other places. But heres the quick summary Ash is a solo frame Ash does a little bit of everything He does it all decently well too but not stunningly well Endgame is focused around teams with each member doing some one thing very very well. Thus having team members with different strengths brings a diversity of power and lots of power to the team. Can you see how Ash fails to mesh well with this?Further if you try to focus on one aspect of Ash and buff that part really hard youll find that you could have picked a different frame to do that one task and result in better performance at that one task.If you really want to try Ash in the endgame my suggestion is to go for flexibility and utility and work very hard on finding your teams weaknesses and shoring them up.,Warframe,ceitsy4,7,t5_2urg0

267322,0,t1_cf84joj,I completely agree. One thing that I think a lot of people disregard when talking about rhino is that he is SUPPOSED to be a tank. Rhino is supposed to soak up damage like nothing. Rhino is supposed to draw aggro away from other lighter frames. And yet people mistake this for op. I think its more that other frames are so bad at taking them I.E Oberon is supposed to be a paladin yet cant survive on front lines valkry is support to be a bezerker yet is severely lacking damage.

Its a defense polarity slot only shared by status chance mods and Hammer Shot so when polarizing there isnt much reason to defense polarity if you dont always want to equip a cold damage mod and Cold damage can really screw up your damage depending on faction and other elemental effects e.g. Magnetic vs Grineer.

327251,0,t3_1xtzaa,I like it. The website looks good too. Comments You can also get a Furis blueprint from the Marketplace. I think another important thing for newbies is to note that elemental mods for weapons can help optimize damage for factions regardless of physical damage type.Build costmaterials is something to bring up  the Vectis requires multiple Orokin Cells which are only more common drops after Saturn and later. Endgame content looks fairly sparse but thats no problem. Newbies just need to know that the Rank  weapons are fun but not necessary for doing very well in the game.Personally I think the Embolist is a fun secondary. MiniIgnis with about half a third the range and double the damage output. Have you tried it out? Edit Range is everything. The Ignis is an actual gun  a good ranged flamethrower. The Embolist is a handheld melee weapon with ammo. Embolist is slightly more viable at higher levels because of its damage output... but burning  enemies at the same time is fun.,Warframe,cfeouxq,2,t5_2urg0

400219,0,t1_cfm8f9b,gt The first bit is an appeal to authority fallacy.It may be howeverOne should not reject the opinion of those that have an understanding of how things work unless you also know how those things work. You dont know how the Warframe generator works or what the programmers attempted therefore you cannot reject this claim which is their claim not mine.  You are refusing to believe that the guys at Digital Extremes worked for a while on this and couldnt solve it within their particular systems and other constraints tile size dynamic location of objective and number of objectives number of doors per tile general consistency in layout etc because you assume you know better due to whatever background you have that you think gives you a higher level of knowledge than the guys at Digital Extremes have about their own systems.  This is stupid and pointless. The maze problem may have been solved for a simple maze but I have yet to see it solved for a game engine with variable tile size like Warframe. Diablo  had very little random generation and I believe Path of Exile functions the same way although I have not played that. Still while looking I have not seen even one solution for a simple maze. The algorithms that exist function only along one path at a time.EDIT Relevant presentation As you can see their tiles are all of the same size which means the multiple paths system is easier to implement due to how they made the connection points. However tiles in Warframe vary a lot in size so a similar system would not work as easily.

The problem that I feel most needs to be addressed as far melee damage is concerned is to eliminate chargenormal attack specific damage mods. The separation of these damage types make players choose which they are going to use in missions and effectively encourages them to ONLY use one of the attack types. For me the choice was easy I chose normal attacks because there are multiple animations. Its boring as hell to see the same animation over and over like you do with charge damage builds. Players should be encouraged to use ALL the different types of melee attacks. ,Warframe,cfph2xp,4,t5_2urg0

The data will be skewed because people who do a few runs and are happy with what they get wont keep track or post and the complainers are far better represented.

531882,0,t1_cg0nabb,Whats weird is they said they will make status mods useful and buff them. I guess their idea of buffing is making a new set of mods that are x stronger than the original mods that could have easily been buffed.The worst part is this wouldnt be so bad if it wasnt for the way you acquire mods. Adding  new mods that all have a near identical effect assuming we get these mods for all elements would just dilute the drop tables further if they ever make these obtainable to the public if they missed the event. I dont think these mods even needed to exist. Thy could have just buffer the chance of status mods to like  or something like the crit rate mods and lower status chances on some of the more ridiculous weapons so they wont have  with  mod and create some actually interesting mods.Worst part is these status mods limit you currently since they are the only useful status mod and their element gets in the way.

This is then reduced by enemy armor.  A single shot from my Dread will do anywhere from three to six times that and it doesnt cost energy I could be spending on say Radial Blind which effectively stuns the entire room for my team to take advantage of.The best powers are those that work independent of enemy strength.

926569,0,t3_24p4ct,. I dont quite get what you mean. Yes obtaining keys is another layer of RNG but removing them would dilute the current nonvoid pool too much. Unless you are saying that the void should just be accessible to anyone then No  lorewise. You can complain that for a game to prosper it has too veer away from the lore sometimes and I would have to disagree. Have DE create another farm spot but never veer away from lore.. The only reason this is an issue is because of key sharing. This could easily be fixed if you couldnt share keys and would need your own key to access the void so  keys spent in total if you have a man void run Or once you start a mission you can leave but not still have the key.. Not everyone has plat and certainly not everyone wants to hang out on trade chat for potential plat gains. Some players dont even want the trade tab to be open at all..

995418,0,t3_25i9ft,I see where youre coming from... but I really cant agree no matter how much I want to. I think Primes could MAYBE use a SMALL buff but I think they work fine as they are.And even if they did need the sort of buffs youre talking about there are some pretty big problems with the implementation.First of all people who ALREADY have Primes without all the extra work your suggested changes would entail would suddenly have MUCH more powerful Warframes at their disposal. Second this would really only be fair if EVERY Warframe had a Prime version as this would some objectively better than others even moreso than is already the case.  Third the whole tests thing is awkward and quite frankly seems like a terrible idea. Someone can use a Warframe well without using all of its abilities and not everyone has the same idea of what using an ability well means. Fourth the whole fifth rank idea is just weird and doesnt work with the mod system at all.tldr I see where youre going with this but I dont think it could be implemented well at least not how youre describing it. Could Primes use additional perks? Maybe. But this goes overboard and makes to many changes to how DE wanted them to work in the first place.,Warframe,chhfpp6,5,t5_2urg0

1103178,0,t1_chtm0oo,When you go into any of the research rooms the first research is always a... Ill just stick with research piece. Basically its an item that you craft whose sole purpose is to be used in the creation of one of the clantech guns. A Fieldron bought from the corpus research lab requires Fieldron Samples to build. So you collect basic resources and Fieldron Samples from enemies then you craft the Fieldron. It has no use of its own but it is a resource required to build the Prova Dera Supra Lanka any of the Corpus Clantech weapons. You seldom need just one for most weapons youll need  of the research piece built one at a time.In your case you need Mutagen Masses for the Dual Ichor. Assuming you join a clan with all the research done buy the Dual Ichor blueprint first then look at it in the foundry to see how many MM you need. Then go back to the dojo and buy that many MM blueprints. Youll spend your time from then on farming Mutagen Samples dropped by Infested enemies. Theyre the blue drops. Youll use those Mutagen Samples along with X amount of other resources to craft all the Mutagen Masses one by one. When thats done you use the Mutagen Masses a Forma and X amount of other resources to create your Dual Ichor.Clantech is a long process. It takes days or weeks to complete a clantech weapon from scratch even assuming you already have the labs ready and the research done. Making a gun Clantech means theres at least a day waiting period for anyone not willing to buy it with platinum while all the clans wait for the initial research to complete. If youve noticed any players getting angry about new weapons being clantech this is why. After that anyone who doesnt already have the required number of research pieces just lying around need to go and farm for them. For the average user that means that it could be up to a week before theyre able to get their hands on the new clantech weapon. Lucky for you many clans already did the research so you dont necessarily have a day waiting period to get the blueprints you need.Now on to the Karak. As with most Grineer guns the high impact damage brings with it a decent chance to stagger and a bonus against corpus units Impact does extra damage to shields which is a favorite health type for Corpus. The Karak also has a decent amount of Slash and Puncture damage making it an average weapon when used against Grineer and giving it a small advantage against Infested and Corpus Crewmen health.Serration Hornet Strike Pressure Point Redirection and to some extent Vitality are the mods you want to rank up first. Youll use them on virtually every weapon and Warframe. Redirection goes on every Warframe except Valkyr for whom I have a strange build because her stats are odd. The base damage mods are well the basis of every weapon. Vitality is great on Valkyr and Rhino but YMMV on most of the other frames. Any castertype frame is going to get little use out of Vitality. If you can only bring one bring Redirection. Your shields will come back health will not. Better that your shields never break than to rely on Armor mitigating damage or buffing your health to prolong your inevitable downing.Beyond that I would recommend buffing what is already good rather than modding to try and make up for deficiencies. If you only have  armor adding  armor will only give you a total of . If you have  Armor that same mod will give you  armor total. Its the same for any stat.On your Karak focus on buffing Base damage first because that buffs every other mod you put on the gun. After that I generally put on a damagetypebuffing mod. In Karaks case Id recommend Rupture to further increase Impact damage. If you choose to move into elemental damage from there that will give you the highest possible elemental damage. All elemental damage is a percentage of your base damage after Serration and damage type buffs. You can never go wrong with Radiation because its extra powerful against half of the midtohigh level Grineer armors and it gets a small damage boost against shields and robotics. Its proc does pretty much the same thing as Nyx Chaos ability though it doesnt seem to be quite as effective as the ability.Alternatively for a more general build you can use Piercing Hit and Sawtooth Clip to buff the other damage types. This produces a slightly weaker but more consistent rifle that you can chip away at enemies with. Karak has a pretty good chance to stagger so you may be more inclined to stunlock an enemy to death rather than attempt to kill them in a single burst. Also its important to remember that although the damage numbers seem a bit low thats for a single bullet. Karak fires in five round bursts IIRC so youll be dealing a decent amount of damage per burst despite what the stats may suggest. Dont bother increasing the fire rate because that only affects the time between bursts not the speed of the bursts themselves. Youll get a very small return in exchange for that mod slot and its cost. I would recommend reload speed and definitely stick an unranked Ammo Mutation on it if you have one. Ammo Mutations are great youll really only need the unranked mod unless youre using a machine pistol or one of the really ammohungry primaries. Karak has pretty decent supportive stats so things like reload speed fire rate and ammo capacity are all pretty much fine unmodded if you want to free those slots up for elemental damage. I wouldnt recommend going for a crit build most Grineer guns have high fire rates but obscenely low crit rates. Vipers are an exception but for guns like Karak Gorgon and Grakata its not generally worth the investment to give them a crit build. You may have extra slots so feel free to fool around with stuff like Split Chamber Metal Auger or Hush. YMMV on Hush it makes your guns silent but for most automatic weapons the enemy will shout before you can kill them and all the nearby enemies will be alerted by that rather than the shots themselves. Highdamage single shot weapons benefit more from Hush than automatics but like I said you might have some free slotspoints to fool around with.Now on to Rhino. What I love about Rhino is that hes insanely durable. Hes perfect for the solo player and he makes it much easier to get yourself into highlevel content and hold your own until your mods and weaponry catch up. IIRC and the math is still the same a maxrank Iron Skin should give you  damage before it breaks. Thats a ton. You can stand around getting shot by  lowlevel moas for minutes before it goes down. Intensify can boost this even higher though the math was a bit nebulous at that point. Id guess that somewhere between the original  and  is where the number caps off. During this ability youre immune to all damage procs hazards knockdowns staggers and knockbacks. Rhino is an immovable object. Even when that shield breaks a maxrank Rhino with a maxrank Redirection comes out to nearly  shields. Under that my Rhino has  health with  armor. When it comes to durability Rhino is the name of the game. Intensify also buffs every other ability giving Rhino Charge and Stomp more damage and increasing the damage boost provided by Roar. Duration and range will positively affect his other stats but I dont bother with that. Instead I built him with maxed abilities maxed Redirection maxed Intensity and the highest Vitality and Steel Fiber I have. Vigor further boosts shields and health Diamond skin reduces your shields weakness to lasers and Fortitude helps you recover shields and resist knockdown whenever Iron Skin is down. Building yourself into an insane tank is pretty much the best way to play Rhino. Free from the fear of dying Rhino is able to hold his own under withering enemy fire and can even solo bosses and minibosses like the Stalker or Zanuka.If youre building him from scratch Id recommend Iron Skin then shields to a point after a few ranks Redirection will eat up a ton of mods cores and duplicates in order to reach the next rank then the rest of his abilities Intensify and finally mixandmatch your favorite defensive mods. Forget sprint speed. Forget most abilityboosting mods that arent Intensify or Narrow Minded which will shrink Stomp and shorten Charge but boost your power strength. Dont even bother with stuff like cold or poison resist thats what Iron Skin is there for. Be the best tank you can be and hell carry you all the way to the highest levels of difficulty. Youll end up relying on your powers to stay alive and your weapons to deal damage but its a great way to learn the nuances of the game and break into LateGame content early. He doesnt have any real CC besides Stomp but playing him is like playing on Easy Mode. Youll virtually never die because nothing but the most punishing situations in the game will ever break Iron Skin.And to wrap this up yes your shotgun mods will work on Carriers shotgun. Its actually a pretty good shotgun its damage is on par with a primary weapon. It deals impact so in some situations Dethcubes rifle is slightly better but on the whole Carriers shotgun is the best Sentinel weapon to have. Remember to unequip any sentinel that isnt Shade if youre attempting a stealth run. Any Sentinel with their attack mod equipped will automatically attack any enemy it can see unless theyre shade with Revenge. If you want the benefits of Guardian automatically instantly refills your shields when they go down limited by a cooldown andor your sentinels available energy but you dont want the sentinel to mess up your stealth run either unequip their attack mod or equip shade instead.,Warframe,chtormf,2,t5_2urg0

Trinity has Link and EVWoL Nekros has SOTD Nyx has chaos and absorb and Mag has shield polarize. All these abilities will do increasing amounts of damage as your enemies get stronger.

With an intensify alone maxed out it is a  damage increase to everything you do.  with a few duration mods on you can have it lasting for  seconds at a time and it can make leveling those super weak weapons that you cannot stand a bit easier.However if you are just using him to progress through the star chart build him for Rhino Stomp.  Build Efficiency and Range and again throw an Intensify on I have not yet found a reason to not use Intensify on Rhino.  With this build you can just run in to an area throw down a stomp and move on to the next room.  simple as that.  nothing on the star chart until you reach like Pluto or Eris will survive a maxed out rhino stomp.  on the off chance they do throw a few bullets at them and move on.  simple as that.Seeing as it can be rather difficult to obtain the arcane helmets now I suggest you pick up a coptering weapon of some sort. Dual Zorens Dual Cleavers Dual Ichors Amphis Scoliac all of em are good.  The extra mobility of having one of those weapons makes up for his slow move speed big time.  I personally am glued to my amphis and when playing rhino refuse to use a melee weapon that cannot copter which is almost sad because my orthos prime had  forma in it.Shoot me a PM if you want my Rhino builds for Stomp or Roar.  Also big suggestion forma his polarity out for Energy Siphon.  Regardless of what build you are using Energy siphon is a fantastic addition to any frame and makes worlds of a difference when running around spamming  energy rhino stomps.,Warframe,ciai79w,4,t5_2urg0

You end up getting more reactors frm alerts than you need. Forma bps drop in void missions so no reason to buy that either. If in doubt get more slots. Edit If you have appetite for risk and skill in sales you could use market arbitration buy stuff that cheap on pc and sell on ps. Confirm that the account transfer moves everything including built weapons helmets mods etc almost certain thats the case. You may have a unique opportunity to not only transfer you plat but even make a significant profit. Do your market research to find high demand items that sell for a lot more on ps than on pc.

I dont think an unstuck button would hurt... Just make it sortof like how mods spawn on a platform after falling down into a pit. Or if in a boss area put you right in the middle.Or at least maybe add a command to log your location when you are legitimately stuck so devs can investigate it.

1542727,0,t3_2bwpnk,Space Confederation has had control of the Sechura node on Pluto for a long time almost as long as Dark Sectors have been around and have been kind enough to host the node at a  tax for the community making it easily the most profitable node to run in terms of affinity and credit farming.ICE is an alliance comprised of former members of Eclipse from my understanding. Eclipse is notorious for overtaxing nodes putting up to a  tax on some of their rails. They manage to maintain control because the average user doesnt know anything about the policies of the rails owners just how much they get paid during the conflict.As it stands right now ICE has a  tax on Sechura. Now while thats certainly bearable any higher and they would risk a slew of other alliances deploying rails to try and knock them off the node its probably only temporary. I have no reason to believe we will not start seeing  taxes on Sechura in the near future from this Alliance. Its in the communitys best interest to support Space Confederation should they attempt to regain control of Sechura because they have proven to be the most benevolent owner of the node.,Warframe,cj9nkzr,16,t5_2urg0

1549336,0,t3_2bywdk,One optimized Hysteria build coming right up! The things that affect Hysterias damage output the most are Attack Speed Critical Damage and Critical Chance.  Dual Zoren and Dual Ichor are ideal I use Dual Zoren because they look better and because they Zorencopter faster outside of Hysteria.  I have Life Strike on in case I want to heal without entering Hysteria and I have Slash damage mods to replace Elemental mods because I dont like Elemental FX and I dont want anyone else seeing my weapons carry Elemental FX. All other mods are necessary. Only Attack Speed mods on the melee weapon affect Hysteria the melee weapons base Attack Speed does not matter.  Warcry will further boost your Attack Speed  just the base maxed version brings you pretty close to the Attack Speed cap. Hysteria is also affected by Power Strength Melee Base Damage and Power Efficiency.  Unfortunately Power Strength has a very limited effect but still noticeable on Hysterias damage output. I suspect this is due to Hysterias large base damage on the claws so any bonus damage from Power Strength  Melee Base Damage is comparatively little and not worth the sacrifices necessary to optimize.  Power Efficiency will be mostly up to your own personal preferences. It depends on how long you want your powers to last and how you spend your energy. My Valkyr has Enemy Sense and Reflex Guard on to enhance her combat performance outside of Hysteria for those times when I absolutely have to use my guns.During Hysteria use the Right Click combo spam melee while you hold down rightclick to kill tough foes.

Its just too hard to do well and conflicts too easily with other mechanics and features in the game. Especially when you hit the mandatory combat in bossbattles and defense missions. gt Instead have multiple small fights as you travel where stealth is part of the opening to each skirmish a way to tilt the battle in your favor before the real fighting usually starts. Each of those fights then needs a way to recover some element of surprise inbetween rather than a continuous tide of everalert enemies.gt  Guards shouldnt be going Hum de doo de doo what a boring day guarding this ship.

Level  as well. New shinier grenades are easy to dodge but I got knockback spammed. Bam.CHALLENGE FAILED.  This is how I meant to do it. Youre going to either need to have really good jump timing some kind of knockback resistance or enough damage so that you can finish off Jackal once he decides to start chaining stomps.

1644001,0,t3_2d5ntw,Upgrade your mods.Specifically you want to focus on upgrading core mods that Ill list here.Core Mods Vitality and Redirection on your Warframe since those give health and shields respectively.  Serration Hornet Strike Pressure Point and Point Blank if you use a shotgun since those increase base damage.  Elemental damage mods Heat Cold Electric Toxin since those add to your base damage as well but check out the wiki for elemental combinations and weaknessesresistances.  Dont worry about Impact Puncture and Slash damage IPS for short mods as they only increase damage of a specific type rather than as a whole.Damage CalculationFor example if you weapon has I P S damage  unmodded adding  slash would make it I P S damage  with that mod whereas adding  heat damage would make it I P S H damage . If that didnt make sense dont worry. Just focus on straight damage first and elemental not IPS second. Upgrading ModsWhen fusing mods fuse duplicates as this is the most cost effective way to upgrade mods. When you have a lot of mods you can also fuse mods of the same polarity for half the exp that duplicates give but I dont recommend this when starting out. I dont want you to accidentally fuse a mod that you shouldnt have. Fusion cores give more exp than duplicates but cost proportionally more. Use them if you have the credits and want to level a mod quick. You have unlimited space for mods so dont feel pressured to sell any. The useless ones are good for fusion fodder anyway. A lot of the mods I listed above have  ranks to them. You can tell by the notches on the left side of the card. Each rank takes double the experience of the last to level up. You wont be maxing Serration any time soon is what Im saying. This is basic advice for beginners theres more complex stuff as you learn the game. Check out the wikia on your free time as it has quite a lot of info on just about everything. Also look at the reddit wiki that has a FAQ section and a section specifically for new playersIf you have any more questions ask away ,Warframe,cjme2c0,8,t5_2urg0

1673333,0,t1_cjpx15j,Thank you very much for your feedback uSilentMobius!  Youve once again put a fair bit of effort into your critique so bear with me while I try to address each of your pointsgtAsymmetry Many of the Warframes have notable chest asymmetry this is because the chest is a large canvas and it needs breaking up in a manner that suggests a suit rather than simply muscle groupsIm not sure what you mean by most here.  The Warframes with zero chest asymmetry are Ash Banshee EmberPrime ExcaliburPrime Hydroid MagPrime Mirage Nekros Nyx Oberon Saryn Trinity Vauban Volt and Zephyr.  The Warframes with some less obvious chest asymmetry are FrostPrime RhinoPrime and Valkyr.  The ones with prominent chest asymmetry are LokiPrime and Nova.gtDont use interlockingstyle plates on the abdomenneck. Warframe armour is much more like a flowing solidgtDeviate from human body but bigger lines in the forearms calves and shoulders. If youre putting more plating that just the suit then what shape are you trying to make? Most Warframes try to break the human shape rather than accentuate it.Ash and Valkyr spring to mind with regard to the plated spine motif.  Some Warframe armor flows some doesnt.  Their designs share many qualities yet vary greatly.  My decision to opt for armor plating and accentuated musculature was a conscious one.  I chose this direction precisely because it deviates from the tendency of existing Warframe designs to appear fleshy and inhuman.  ARMA is intended to look heavy muscular and clad in armor similar to a knight.gtThe feet look too much like feet. Most of the Warframes have stylized boots MirageBallet shoes Saryn Heels Banshee Arabic shoes what do armoured toes add to the design aesthetic of this suit? Given the inverted triangle shape of a bull from the front Id minimize the feet.Again this was a conscious design choice of mine.  I like the bare foot look on Excalibur Nekros Nyx Mag etc. and I thought putting it on ARMA would give him a more brutal animal appearance.  As discussed elsewhere in this thread I cant go for the hooved feet look because I feel its too similar to Oberon and Loki but I am working on an alternative design to make ARMAs feet appear less catlike as a handful of redittors have suggested.gtFocus on the nontypical features of a bull The thick wattle. the back of neck hump high an huge glutes rather than the humancompatible onesRemember that first and foremost this is a Dark Knightthemed Warframe concept.  The inclusion of bullthemed elements is meant to be more of an accent rather than an overarching motif.  The elements Ive chosen to communicate the bull accent are the horns the prominent scapulae and vertebrae which should address your neck hump suggestion and the exaggerated musculature.gtTo sum up IMHO the aesthetic of the DE Warframe is how can we disrupt the perception of humanity whereas the aesthetic of your design is human with bull head the silhouette of it would be described as Minotaur without a second thoughtYou seem to be laboring under the presumption that art is received in the same manner by everyone.  Ive heard a wide range of responses to my work and not just about the ARMA design and yours is just one of hundreds of varying interpretations.  I say this not to diminish the value of your opinion but rather to highlight that you seem to have a very specific vision of what a Warframe should look like.  This is the beginning of an original concept and as before I once again sincerely invite you to show us your idea of a good fan concept Warframe.  Im genuinely interested!It seems obvious but I think its worth stating I am not Mynki.  By that I mean I am not trying to duplicate the art style of Warframe here.  I am trying to emulate a few common aspects of the games visual style but the bottom line is that I am fundamentally a different person a different artist whos been cultivating his own style and approach to design over his entire life.  When I design a character I like anyone else am going to include elements I personally enjoy drawingseeing.  Ill put my own spin on things because its fun for me and it gives people Im collaborating with a perspective they may not have considered before.  I think its more important for artists to be different rather than the same in order to develop the most interesting ideas.  The ARMA Warframe concept is simply me injecting a bit of my own style into the Warframe universe.  Not everyones going to like it but I dont expect them to.  I expect only to have a good time doing what I love.Thanks again for your input!,Warframe,cjq33bd,2,t5_2urg0

1780603,0,t1_ck3iohe,Only bad decision I have encountered in terms of the UI was the recent . update making it difficult to easily identify mods. Ironically all of the other UI updates went from a more textual to graphical ingame representation for the UI  the opposite of what the Mod UI update did! The ingame UI makes it more immersive and the visual aspect makes it easy to quickly navigate and find things.The previous mod UI adhered to this even if it was outdated. Every mod card had easily identifiable visuals frontandcenter with their own unique colourizations. Drain rates and polarities were fairly large making them easy to skim over. There was a large contrast with the old rank visuals. Compare that with the new system that uses primarily text in compressed view which is the view you will be searching for mods in has important information in a smaller font size lacks colour variation between mods of the same rarity and uses prettier rank indicators that tend to blend in with their backgrounds making it harder to quickly acquire that information on a first glance.The mod capacity details are also in the upperleft now which is fairly disjointed from the mods themselves now that the selectable mods are at the bottom of the screen instead of on the left.If youre going to criticize the UI team please be consistent and constructive with your criticism. And if youre going to say they are not in the right part of the industry you should give some credentials to back up such a heavyhanded statement.,Warframe,ck3lkwq,3,t5_2urg0

But console users dont have these input methods readily available no mouse limited amount of buttons not to mention that they dont sit in front of a computer screen either small fonts become impractical. The only option left would therefore be to design and implement two entirely different UIs which as you might imagine is quite costly for the dev team.

1978732,0,t1_ckrmf9w,Again Id contest this.The unique way in which Warframe makes its money makes its player base just as unique. You dont have hardcore fanatics that buy the game after watching  trailers you have a player base that largely consists of casuals who thought to try it out and ended up staying because it was fun. People dont play the game because the spent  on it and want their moneys worth they play it because it is genuinely addictive.The problem with having a player base like that is that it is easy to get them the game is free and it is pretty fun and very hard to keep them at the first sign of mehness the player will feel no loss in just letting go of the game. This ends up in having a MASSIVE but constantly changing and flipping player base. You will always have a large number of noobs invited by veterans or they just saw the game is free and a large number of veterans. The noobs are easy to please as they have everything to gain. The veterans are harder to please because at a certain point the game ceases to reward you. Mods become sooooo expensive to rank up. Items that are worth a damn become soooo difficult to acquire. To achieve anything better you have to lock yourself into a play style and forma your item to suit it. This is reinforced by the fact that the rare items are so rare that you just want to annihilate everything as quick as possible to speed up RNG. The game loses the fun factor. The other part is that you create a disconnect between the veterans and the noobs. The noobs want to rank up and have fun and the game bountifuly rewards them for it. Veterans just want specific items and are locked into mundane grinds to get it. Veterans wont play with noobs and help them out. Try having a conclave of less than  and trying to get into a T Exterminate EVEN if you are a veteran player.This all goes back to my point If the rewards were worth the grind everyone would be happier but they arent and more and more people are realizing this and complaining. They can either address this now while they have their player base or start losing business to the competition and address it when it is too little too late. If you want to create a pay wall which is your right make it reasonable.  for Nyx Prime and accessories and I guarantee you more people will buy it and net profit will be higher.Edit Please dont downvote uFubulicious s comment.

Perhaps there might be a story eventually attached to the mission flow.

Actually The Arbiters might make a better opponent for Steel Meridian in a way after all the Tenno are extremely powerful and the Arbiters of Hexis seem interested from a very shallow perspective mind they are probably a bit more nuanced in removing the Tenno from the fight. And where would that leave the colonies then when the Tenno arent taking the Grineer and Corpus apart?PlusgtThey may be extremists but their goal IS to bring peace even if they have to cause a lot of collateral damage. This is true of extremist groups in real life even. At least to some extent the leadership may or may not just be doing it for their own gain but the lower rungs genuinely believe that doing the awful things they do is somehow the right thing. Theyre nuts obviously but most people do the things they think are right not the things they think are evil.But yeah I do get that a lot of concessions were made in the name of balance but... well Im not sure the way it was done makes sense otherwise.,Warframe,clkqvim,1,t5_2urg0
2211000,0,t3_2kfavh,. Mag is an excellent frame. Trinity on the otherhand has lost most of her usefulness since now her blessing is entirely reactive instead of proactive. . Thats why you have  ranks on a frame.. to learn the abilities and how they work etc. You shouldnt even consider moving on to a new frame until you maxed out your original.. Trinity is on one of the HIGH level planets for a good reason. You wont get it anytime soon unless you basically leech off someone else kind enough to taxi you there  times so you can get all the pieces you need. . Healer is NOT a playstyle. You dont need a healer typically and even when you do theres minimal amounts of it needed. This is a run and gun game. If you think you can just sit back and heal people.. this is the wrong game for you. ,Warframe,clkve4p,2,t5_2urg0
2211282,0,t1_clkwjby,Arbiters are... interesting. The description implies that Tenno can become something more powerful than mere warriors and their potential is limited. What can be more powerful than a superhuman battlemage? A god. On first impression that sounds kind of worrying unless the only Warframes theyve seen are healers. Most other frames are designed for combat and making space wizards into deities doesnt exactly seem like a good idea since the lore makes it seem like many Tenno are kind of unstable. I can see how they could be looking for knowledge but that initial splash along with their ranks Crusader Maxim remind me more of videogame religious zealots than academics. ,Warframe,clkwolg,1,t5_2urg0

2218019,0,t3_2kilqp,The UI while cleaner than before does need to be improved yes. I do think DE has a lot of feedback on this so hopefully well get improvements in future updates. I think melee . adds depth to the game and makes melee combat a lot more fun and a little bit less spammy. I think its a good start but a lot of the stances only have one or two combos outside of the basic combo. Its a start but a far cry away from the variety you see in spectacle fighters.  I think that there should be aerial combos juggling and launchers perhaps we could repurpose quick melee when we equip our melee weapon? I dont think it does anything when we equip it. Or we could remove channeling and replace it with the old charge attacks?. I think parrying should be simplified to being a regular timed block. To make it useful for ranged enemies timed blocks should be able to reflect projectiles and bullets. Also the cost needs to scale on a smaller level since blocking absorbs too much stamina in my opinion. ,Warframe,cllrhwq,1,t5_2urg0

I mean there are more game modes than i can actually remember. And all the new content DE brings like Archwing and weapons and events etc. should give long term players at least some thing to do for some time. Still I do think some changes are unacceptable like the hidden Viver nerf and other stuff but this game is constantly changing. And thats one of biggest things i love and hate about WarframeDE. I dont play this game every day but I love to keep track of the changes being made and to come back after some time and see what this game has become. What I do not get is people that do not want more content but more bug fixes... I mean i would agree with that and also enjoyit a lot but wouldnt the other endgame players cry out even louder about not having anything to do? I think the playerbase of this game has just gotten too big to satisfy them all...So to come to a conclusion I have to say DE is doing a great job I enjoy the game a lot as a FP title but if i would have to pay a monthly fee I would criticize them a bit more. ,Warframe,cm0bxph,-4,t5_2urg0

2341981,0,t1_cm169uj,I assume youve played highlevel Interception? If not then imagine dozens of highspeed motherfuckers who hit like a truck lock you to a specific distance so you cant dodge take a fourth of an Imperator magazine to kill and have perfect aim. At that point surrounded by twenty or so enemies the only solution you have is Shield Repel Repel. This discourages gun use. I want to encourage gun use.I agree. Its possible to get better at aiming. But in Archwing mode it isnt enjoyable. Its fairly easy to get better at hitting when youre in a Warframe not so similar when youre trying to track an enemy in a horde of dozens of identicallooking ones just so you can finish it off. The way things are is that with the difficulty of hitting theres no incentive to learn aiming in Arch mode when you can just Repel.See you cant assume that everybody operates the way you do. You may have found it easy to do all that I mentioned above but many dont. Should we alienate that demographic of the player base entirely? Some people learn quickly others more slowly and others slower still. We want them to improve but at the same time we dont want them to see improvement as a chore if games were like that Id study violin instead. Its also a case of exclusion.

2516369,0,t1_cmmsbjr,The more I think about the more Trinity seems like a balancing nightmare to me. Shes a force multiplier Not very strong on her own but she makes everyone else on her team perform better. That makes her very difficult to handle. Not only do you have to do a very careful balancing act on the edge between overpowered and useless but the release of another frame has the potential to tip that balance. That potential exists for all frames but is particularly pronounced with Trinity because she is so uniquely capable of making up for another frames shortcomings.So Im not surprised DE seems to be having trouble with Trinity. The only easy way to balance her would be to either not worry about her being overpowered which would mean accepting that she might become all but mandatory for any organised group or not worrying about her being underpowered which would relegate her to garbage tier.

That might just be my love for lots of colors to swarm the screen haha. But A Pure dmg build is good if you focus almost solely on youre secondary fire explosions I Dislike only using one half of the weapon so I build high dmg and status so i can explode and laser some faces.Anti Grineer buildAnti Corpus A blast proccing build I made since you said you enjoy blast procs hahaIve put in many formas and a potato and might throw in another forma but without formas or potatos you can still get it to deal good dmg What youd mod it without any extras  for anti corpus at least  no status procs hear really since without the formas and event mods and split chamber its hard to make  status do much       Amphrex Here is my one of my amphrex builds  Crit chance gets you up to dem double crits . crit dmg takes that  dmg to astonishingly high numbers  I myself almost soley use my amphrex with volt And am still in the middle of testing more status and dmg of an event mod vs Hammer shots same status but crit dmg increase as well as just straight dmg of a  elemental mod might need to forma my amphrex againSpartan LaserSamus cannonBFG          AKA Opticor Mine is currently Built as a fast one shot cannon As the splash dmg unreliably procs or doesnt proc on hit for me I prefer line destroying I have the  fire rate mods on there because at high level play  second is the most you can really spare to kill something before it kils you. I also Built it this way to fuel my nova anti matter drop explosions. I swap out the Elemental mod depending on which enemy i will face.        Using Burston Prime as a blast machineMay require you to make your scroll wheel a fire mechanism to work to all its glories but it will work fairly well as a blast proc midrange machine gun granted its not full autoI personally wouldnt use this build as i Have a syndicate mod for the weapon and Usualy dont find blast a good dmg component.And sorry I dont have my braton prime to show you Mine is currently Lvl  and in line to be made into a monsterIts only like rd thoughFinally As closure My mirage Bringing the night with quanta splosions Then the rave with supra shots unfortuantly im on seimani which screws with all color shoulda thought about that ahead of time but you get the picture... get it... oh insert religious figure that was bad...

2579662,0,t3_2pc36n,gt Specifically a clan built on the idea of being open to teaching newer players the ropes of the game and to provide a fitting concept for a Tenno clan. I enjoy helping people learn how to get by in Warframe and Ive wanted to open a clan where new players can go to look for a hand when they need it.Thats a pretty neat idea! Heres some news that might be related DE will slowly be phasing in the Guides of the Lotus system in HUBS which will be a special sigil given to players who then enter Relays across the system and provide tips or guidance to new players. Once this system is further developed perhaps you may be interested in joining!gt But Im really not sure if its possible or plausible to build a clan from the ground up since most people will prefer for obvious reasons to find or stick with a clan that has all the research complete and available trading posts.Well costs to build clan stuff are based on the max number of players your clan can support. I believe the smallest and starting clan size is . If you keep the clan at this size then your build costs for everything is significantly reduced. Granted it will still take much of your time to farm the materials and spend the resources but far less overall than the  member clans.Overall I personally wouldnt recommend it given that its a large use of resources that may be better spent on weapons and warframes. Unless youve got a few friends to help you out or are very comfortable making new friends with new players the clan might take up more of your time than just offering your help to new players asis.,Warframe,cmvaska,6,t5_2urg0

2615326,0,t3_2ptqex,I have to agree with you. It feels like DE is trying to force us to play archwing missions. I just think archwing weapons should be craftable with normal resources because that would make me at least want to test them out in archwing missions. By putting archwing stuff in archwing missions there is no incentive for me to waste my time grinding a play mode I do not like for weapons that apparently are not fun to use velocicrap dual decurmisseseveryshot.Edit To the players who replied to my statement. What I meant was that if SOME of the archwing weapons can be made with non archwing exclusive resources that would be more than enough incentive to play archwing missions in order to test them out. But as of right now I really really do not like grinding archwing missions for weapon parts. But like you said thats just my opinion and I am sure what I think is not going to take away from your archwing experience. You like Archwing missions? That is great!

2670981,0,t1_cn77uoi,Adding to your statementI believe the reason why he likes only putting one defensive mod on is because in the high level content T void for example the mobs start chunking you hard. So he much rather use the extra slot for more powerefficencyrangeetc since the HP or Shield from the defense mod is moot when facing a squad of Corrupted Nullies and Bombies flanked by a platoon of Heavy gunners. Higher level players are more adapt at using movement and their frames abilties to counter some of the damage but newer players should not feel bad about equipping more defensive mods at least until they get a better feel for the game.,Warframe,cn77xs2,0,t5_2urg0

2737194,0,t3_2reumy,Honestly I have been playing this game from a year and I can tell you out of all the frames I play Banshee has to be one of the most fun to play for me. I use her as the ultimate crowd control frame as her moves arent too focused on damage as they are range. I would honestly recommend a high power efficiency and max range build for her and relying on resonance to increase the duration of sonar. I mainly use her with my Hek or another shotgun so it will be hard for me to miss the sonar spot. This  is my personal build for banshee and Ive enjoyed ever single second of using it. With max range you literally have a m stun lock and a m pushbackknockdown which is absolutely devastating and then the strength from transient still makes sonar a force to be reckoned with. Resonance and the prime continuity are there to make sure sonar lasts a decent amount of time and with max efficiency it becomes a spammable move. Her silence also more makes a good panic stun as it stuns an enemy who comes in contact with it. This is very situation though for example it can be handy when needing to get through an area fast with taking minimal damage or when you get surrounded it becomes a get out of jail free card. Overall I feel like the build I use makes Banshee a great support cc frame that can boost your teams damage. ,Warframe,cnf7gr7,5,t5_2urg0

I mainly only talk to other WF players on Reddit and Steam though I didnt spend much time here until I picked Warframe back up heavily in the past few months.gtHow often do you visit and participate on this subreddit? Are there any factors that would affect your participation?I visit every day and I comment here and there if its something I know well enough.gtIs there anything on the subreddit would you like to be involved with in particular? Contests and events? Weekly thread maintenance? Helping style the CSS? Other?I have some experience with CSS but as of now the subreddit is quite nice as it is.  If anything Id like to see more visible moderating rather than less.  Apart from meta threads I dont think I see moderators speaking officially much.  I think having a visible presence is beneficial to the community and the sub as a whole.  Its a lot easier to reply to a mod comment than to message the mods specifically.gtAre there any concerns with the subreddit right now that you would tackle as a Moderator? What are they and how would you go about addressing them?Not particularly.  Maybe a little more comment moderation the other subs I mod usually remove low effort  troll posts pretty often.gtDo you have any new suggestions for current moderation standards new weekly threads or other improvements? Yes or no will suffice here were not here to steal your ideas unless you want to share them anyway thats cool too!As I mentioned before more community interaction here is better.  Its good to see that the ones running the sub are participating too.gtBecoming a Moderator will increase your interaction with the community as a whole not just particular users threads topics or mediums. Are you ready for the entire community to see you?Yes.  I have no problem with moderating.gtDespite best intentions and efforts there will always be users who will criticize your actions make false accusations or otherwise put you down. How have you dealt with discontent disapproval or disagreement in the past and how are you prepared to handle this criticism in a position of power?Trolls will be trolls.  The admins prefer that we simply ignore them.  Some others just want to be offended by something and sometimes you just have to let them vent.gtDo you have any prior moderation experience on reddit?Yes.

2892816,0,t3_2t92t5,Ive been thinking long and hard about how to fix Embers problems. The fact she requires all four stats strength duration range efficiency is untenable since all current highend builds on all frames rely on corrupt cards to discard one stat in exchange for buffing the others.The proper way to fix her would probably be to just redesign some of her powers but I dont think DE wants to spend the time for such an old frame. Theyd need to do a complete Frames . to make this actually worthwhile.However.I think there might just be a way to make her a very interesting frame with the current abilities and just minor changes. First Id eliminate the max duration on World on Fire. It should be Embers Peacemaker a toggle that keeps draining. Second and thats the key Id make it so enemies killed within WoFs range have a higher chance of dropping energy orbs.If you think about it youll realize this suddenly changes everything. Embers design encourages her to get in the thick of it and her upgraded armor further emphasizes this but she quickly burns out ha due to lack of energy. With this modification the M.O. for Ember would be to cast WoF then aggressively run for targets to kill so she can sustain her casting. The more she kills the more she gets energy the more she can sustain herself. If no enemies are in range you toggle out of WoF and regen for a bit. It also means you can focus less on energy efficiency in favor of the other stats. Bonus points if the amount of orbs is tied to another stat.If energy orbs are too overpowered with other frames leeching them then Id make it so the enemies directly replenish a bit of energy when they die.,Warframe,cnwx0wg,26,t5_2urg0

2982931,0,t3_2ucjqn,Excalibur needs max range Stretch Overextended the maximum damage you can get Blind rage Transient fortitude Intensify maybe Pendragon if youve the plat to spend and Natural talent. Add to that some efficiency fleeting expertise streamline if you can fit them but if the Trinity knows her job and is well built its not needed. Natural talent is often overlooked but Is crucial to get the most affinity possible. Also theres nothing more painful as an Excalibur when the other Excalibur doesnt have it and barely kill half the enemies you do resulting in you missing a lot of shared XP for your weapons.Rank  mods are not necessary you can stop at rank  or  and youll have enough killing power to one shot with the Rhino buff.For Trinity you need max range Stretch Overextended the most strength you can get Blind rage transient fortitude intensify and the most negative duration possible fleeting expertise transient fortitude. Negative duration is super important for Energy vampire dont overlook it.Your job will be to stand on a crate and aim at somewhere you see enemies coming then spam Energy vampire at the edge of the excaliburs Radial javelins range.This way you and the rest of the party get lots of energy constantly. Same as for Excaliburs Rank  is good enough.For Rhino Ill let to other players with more experience talk.Corrosive Projection s really welcomed in the aura slot making everything go a lot smoother and making a big difference in affinity gains.From my experience Trinity is the hardest to play for that while Rhino is the easiest. Im not talking about builds but actual playing during the farm.It should also be noted that while the Excaliburs get the most Reputation of the party theyre getting half as much weapon XP as Trinity or Rhino. They usually need  full rounds or good full rounds to cap their weapons while Trinity and Rhino cap their weapons XP in  notsogood full rounds.The entire thing works as killing an enemy in high level interception makes a new one spawn so in Draco Ceres or Stephano Uranus? the Excaliburs radial javelins covers pretty much all the map killing instantly the enemies and making new ones spawn resulting in tons of kills by the time the round is ended. The rounds take times to end because the party usually takes only  points then neutralize a third without capturing it the time it takes to get a short lead. This way both the enemy and your progress bar fills slowly at the same rate meaning the party will win the round. Enemies never have time to capture a point as they die super fast.There is some variation to that with MirageOberon instead of Rhino or with only  excal and Nekros to get more ressources mods per rounds.It should be noted that its more of an endgame type of farm when youve already done too much of the normal leveling process and youre leveling mastery fodder weapons multiformaed weapons or just getting quickly your reputation cap before doing something else. The builds are quite strict and need lots of rare mods potatoes and some forma.,Warframe,co76bfi,2,t5_2urg0

You want access to everything. Good for you.I hate to break it to you though that isnt really how this game works. If you want the new content youll have to grind the old content in the majority of cases. If you want a specific type of Kubrow Ill pretty much just lol at that. Ive found one kubrow egg during my  hour stint in warframe and I have this odd feeling that eggs wont be seeing a buff to drop rate in the near future. I did of course buy  more eggs after the one I found during the quest so it barely counts in the first place but I still have only bred  kubrow breeds successfully.This game takes dedication and finesse or it takes money. Pick your poison but if youre not willing to pony up the cash then dont complain to me about how youre pissed off that your last paris prime part hasnt dropped for you in your last  runs because Ive run single void missions  times with no result and Ive butchered thousands of kubrows and demolished hundreds of their homes only to find one single egg.A side note for you beginners this game has one of the most excellent and supportive playerbases you could hope to find in any game much less a freetoplay. If youre really having trouble with some of the content and provided that the content in question is not a questline that most players before you have played through already and thus cannot help you there is no end to the number of players willing to help you out. Ask around in region chat recruit chat join a clan or found a clan and join an alliance like I did and you will find people willing to help you. As it stands you have a mountain of content that you really ought to go through anyway like the star chart before you start complaining about the complexities of  minute survival runs and how you cant survive that long.TLDR who the fuck comes into this game with the entitled attitude of I deserve a Rhino Prime and a Boltor Prime as starting equipment so I can farm all the content? If the answer is you then youre a damned idiot. You have to earn that gear build it develop it and invest in it before itll give you the output you want... if you dont like that idea its time to throw money at the problem or GTFO.,Warframe,coehbn0,1,t5_2urg0

Torid is nothing  fantastic even with a bit of formaing and its the most situational the rest are very good by themselves You can still get a lot out of a frame without a forma if you are willing to tolerate an aura that matches the slot and I just dont feel the need to forma sentinels. Never even put a reactor in one.Opticor on the other hand has some wonderful potential but it needs forma in it. You can pump out a lot of damage and pretty quickly once you have things like speed punch through which is highly important for that gun and a bunch of damage mods but until then it can feel a little sluggish and ineffective.,Warframe,cojt6bs,5,t5_2urg0

WHAT?The Mag is just as good as any other warframe but you want to drop the starter gear ASAP and get a Lex You can get one prebuilt for K. The starter gear is total shit and beyond that the Dread is best against Infested the Corpus will just giggle at you and keep charging until youre dead.Youre having so much trouble because youre clearly not geared up for antiCorpus. Clearing the map is a bit of a stretch goal youre going to want some decent gear before then. My suggestion is the normal Braton and the Lex. Both can be bought with credits for relatively cheap and theyre reliable guns. Dont expect them to start shining in high level missions until you at LEAST max them up and get some decent mods on them. Potatoes advised clearly. After that find gear that looks interesting and go for it. Anything from frames guns to mods. Seriously dont skimp on your arsenal. Its your life blood.

Indeed Soma Prime is mostly Slash for physical damage but it also has a decent amount of Puncture. I would argue that Boltor Prime is more versatile because its not limited by a crit build but it really depends on your build. Drop Vile Acceleration into Boltor Prime and optimize Soma Prime for singletarget DPS. Boltor Prime wins in burst DPS in a landslide but damage per shot is only slightly higher. Soma Prime?

Screw it.Yeah the game makes the mistake of presenting the Kubrow quest early. Its meant as more of a lategame thing.gt  I also got another Archwingthing quest but its also a huge grind so I quit it. Archwing is also meant to be more of a midtier goal for players who are more comfortable with the game mechanics.Basically your entire first paragraph is all stuff thats meant for players who have overcome that newness of the game and are generally experienced. The issue isnt with you the game presents all of these options as potential avenues when the reality is that players need to really get truly acclimated with Warframes systems before pursuing all the complex loot and game modes.gt What the hell am I supposed to do in that game? Just play every map without a real goal? No quests just grinds no item progression cant get resources for any damn blueprint nothing.The game is all about selfmade goals TBH. It doesnt work with everyone. Basically look at the weapon Blueprints you have access to and make that your longterm goal.Your short term goal should be getting weapons and Warframes to get you where you want to be. Rhino from VENUS is an obvious first Warframe goal as well as a weapon upgrade such as the standard Braton Burston Strun or Latron as all of those primary weapons cost credits rather than resources to obtain.As you get more comfortable learning the mechanics you will be able to branch out to the other planets. Playing PUBLIC with other players knowing to fuse mods together and install them on your items and slowly becoming more familiar with your Warframe abilities and general gameplay are how to tackle the games start.Progression in the beginning is slow and like I said its not for everyone. But the game truly opens up in the midgame once youre about halfway through the starchart because suddenly everything is attainable. You could go in any direction you want but its only after youve built up that collection of resources bit by bit. If there isnt patience for that then other games will have more structured progression models than Warframe does.,Warframe,cp72twz,2,t5_2urg0

3349995,0,t3_2yj5r2,Well... i got my oberon up to level . And honestly i didnt like him.Instead of doing one thing and doing a badass job at at he tried to half ass every single one you could do.His smite barely does damage sure it was usefull for knocking people down for capture missions but then again it barely did damage only time i used it for was for the knockdown it couldnt even take down the ospreys with a single Smite.Hallowed ground i found only one use for... ever. A guy was stuck inside the wall in an Exterminate mission of mine so i used Hallowed ground and made it go through the wall and kill him there otherwise it does too little damage too slowly and even in defense missions it was not that good because the enemies were too much on the move for that little spot.Renewal was the thing i used the most because on early levels he is kinda squishy and having a healer is always nice. But this is the only thing that was considered by me usable.Reckoning did absolutely nothing. Sure it could spawn health orbs but I had to have Flow and use all of my energy to take half the health of a level  Infested Charger.

If the blue line is all the way up it should flash and this means you are ready to do the Rank Up test.

3444561,0,t3_2zoszl,I feel like DE has created an us vs them scenario. This has lead to very heavy handed changednerfs. Its as if they are saying Ill give you something to complain about They are making it a point to balance weapons and such for pvp and for the life of me I cannot fathom why the weapons are not balanced for PVE. This game is supposed to be about choices and yet we still have tiers of equipment. There are a lot of weapons I would love to use instead of the meta but I honestly cant justify it.There is no sense of direction with anything they are adding into the game. They come up with an idea add it in and move on to the next thing. I dont think kubrows or archwing were as popular as they were expecting. The kubrows are neat but they dont bring the kind of utility as the sentinals. Archwing really serves no actual purpose to the game other than mastery fodder you dont gain anything for the base game other than points. Maybe someday they will incorporate them into the regular missions but who knows how long that might take. The starter archwing is boring and the grind can be very frustrating when trying to get new equipment. Tellurium and other new resources are added in simply to make sure people have to farm to get the new stuff and not just use older materials you have already stockpiled.Prime mods are there to sink mods and credits into. Get people playing and farming and spending money.I have over  hours played time and nowhere near having everything complete. I could not even imagine how daunting it would seem for a new player. Maybe Im cynical but this is a business and I feel like they are doing everything in their power to frustrate people and bring in revenue by pumping out as much content as possible and moving on to the next thing.,Warframe,cpkwlj9,16,t5_2urg0

For example she can oneshot any enemy in the game with her  ability combo and is functionally immortal if played correctly  damage reduction for her AND the entire squad plus Link plus armour.Chaos lasts much longer than the radiation proc from Disarm and allows units to use their weapons against each other often pretty effectively.

3502712,0,t3_30e01v,Boltor Prime and Soma Prime have the highest sustained DPS in the game AFAIK. Personally I use Soma Prime and even with just one Forma on it it wrecks a solid amount of face. If youre not in a group of  people you might run into some ammo conservation though.For secondaries its hard to go wrong with a Syndicate secondary. Synoid Gammacor is still strong despite the nerf Rakta Ballisticas Syndicate proc is extremely strong radial automatic viral proc. Yes please. and Vaykor Marelok has very high damage per shot and status chance. I havent seen the others in action so I cant comment on them.For end game material melee is mostly a utility slow for getting around quickly and avoiding fire. Dual Ichors works if you like crits andor are running Valkyr. Scindo Prime with Tempo RoyaleCleaving Whirlwind if you like big numbers. Tipedo if  you just wanna go fast or want to run a Zephyr who pretty much never has to touch the ground.,Warframe,cprj8he,2,t5_2urg0

I do stop shooting as soon as I see a message in chat I would think most players arent total arseholes who kill targets just to annoy you buta it happens in less than  of the missions I run no targets in void as far as I recall it makes up . of the targets I kill.  Its not really something thats in a nonsynthesis persons mind.  b synthesis people like to remind you not to shoot about  seconds before the target is dead do you honestly get no warning before the target is already being shot at or are you expecting everyone to be a synthesis person?  This game has a momentous grind for newer players Id really rather not be sidetracked with ancillary grinds for now.  Unless Im missing some big advantage from scanning I would think it us up to the synthesis person to not expect players still grinding for gear to have explored synthesis too and for the warning to come near the start of the mission or earlier than we start shooting at it.,Warframe,cpvfe3l,1,t5_2urg0

I think at least some of the time they try to overcome the already existing walls like needing . million credits for fusing ONE mod.  Or the one needing to play a whole lot with a frame they dont like to get it to lv. Or needing to play a whole lot with a frame they like to forma it  times. List goes on.I dont want to complain or something but back in the day one thing I really liked in this game that even grinding was fun. I played a whole lot time on the earth defense mission for no good reason  I had enough credits I had enough resources I could have done something else but I simply enjoyed the game.

3553374,0,t1_cpxa704,The whole movement system does need a rework I agree. But there are other ways to get around the map quickly if you know how to manage your momentum well. While coptering was an unintended mechanic you still have the choice of using those weapons. Besides many of the greatest inventions have been accidents. Getting around may be a little slower than if you were using the tipedoceramic bladesdual zorenetc but it is still possible. I often choose a weapon for the utility of being able to move around quickly for when I am using a frame that does not have an optimal movement speed.

3739290,0,t3_337yfv,Blade Storm was changed a while back. It used to be that Blade Storm picked  targets and attacked them until both Ash and his holograms had attacked  times. So this means if you Blade Stormed three targets youd use up those  attacks on those three targets meaning  attacks per target. If you used Blade Storm on a boss or enemy player youd keep going until youd hit them  times which did a load of damage that ignores armour and causes bleed procs.Now it only allows one attack per target except Synthesis Targets which for some reason will soak up your Blade Storm attacks as it used to.Personally it wasnt really a nerf Ash needed. It let him Blade Storm a large group of enemies and take a second run at that Bombard that survived without waiting for the bleed proc to kill him. But I guess its use on a single target was considered far too powerful.,Warframe,cqii4ls,3,t5_2urg0

3879881,0,t3_34toqu,ExcaliburTenno ArmamentDuration Cooldown Excalibur Arms himself with one of three unique weapons based on what he is using currently for. His primary weapon is replaced by an Orokin marksman rifle think a fancier tiberon which is a single shot high accuracydamage weapon with some minimal punch through. His secondary is replaced by a pair of Pyranas with notably increased damage output. His melee is replaced by a significantly larger Skana with a significant damage enhancement. Effected by strength and duration.Martial MasteryDuration Cooldown Excalibur channels energy to push his combat talent to its limits. While in this state he gains a damage buff and another buff based on his current equipped weapon. If used while holding his primary it grants significant punchthrough and reduces recoil. If used on his secondary weapon it gains a  chance to deal a random physical damage proc with each hit. If used while melee is equipped Excalibur gains infinite stamina increased attack and movespeed and channeling has no cost.Hold the LineDuration Cooldown Excalibur and all nearby Tenno gain fire rate and attack speed. Weapons no longer use ammunition for the duration.Arsenal BarrageCooldown Excalibur calls on the spirits of fallen Tenno to rain weapons from the sky. Weapons that fall are randomly selected from the arsenals of all players in Excaliburs party. Enemies struck by the weapons take damage and are pinned to the spot for  seconds. Allied Tenno and Excalibur himself may pick up and use weapons which are consumed after using a single magazine melee weapons do not expire. All weapon damage is normalized based on type and scales with power strength.So the idea here is to take Excalibur and make him a frame thats really based around doing what Tenno do destroy people with awesome weapons.

For DPS you want Strength blind rage transient fortitude intensify and Range overextended stretch.All in all its up to you and where you are in the game.

3909301,0,t1_cr1brmv,Its a tough call. Ive been playing for maybe  months now and my mentor clan leader I met my first week playing through the reddit clan page gave me tons of free mods to get started like serrationflowstreamlineetc said the same thing. Complained that Vauban took him  months to get. So I bought him. Then got all the parts within  weeks. But that was a full month of wrecking ODDs and trolling the hell out of PUGs with Bounce that I otherwise wouldnt have had. Good times. To be fair I knew by my second day of playing that the game was amazing and had purchased both prime access packs right away NovaSoma Prime totally worth it credit affinity boosters almost moreso and had a ridiculous amount of platinum and no idea how quickly it disappears. Had already bought Ember Volt Loki  clan weapons and a couple cosmetic helmets. While I feel a little dumb for buying the clan guns and Ember I dont regret it. Venka looks amazing and Loki still gets some use if my prime runs out of revives. Im lucky enough to be a whale though and have spent over  on the few FP games I really like  WF so far! Will spend more for sure gt on Path of Exile since closed beta and close to  on Marvel Heroes. Its fools like me that allow most others to enjoy a free game and Im okay with that. ,Warframe,cr1w8jp,2,t5_2urg0

3916736,0,t1_cr2nfrk,IIRC there should be some information in the sidebar related to returning players specifically.Most of Warframes combat should remain familiar. You shoot things you jumpkick you copter. Melee attacking while in the air will now either do a momentumboosting Air Attack or the good ol Ground Slam depending on whether youre looking up or down.Abilities have been altered slightly so read up on what your frames actually do now on the wiki or in the Arsenal. They also changed where abilities are and how they work. Instead of being mods that you rank up they are a part of the frame themselves. They are upgraded automatically as the frame ranks up from  same as health and shields. Our mod pages lost the four ability slots but gained two additional blank slots. We may have lost the extra slots on frames like Rhino where everyone only ran Iron Skin but in return every frame now gets free ability upgrades instead of having to spend coresduplicates on them and there are more slots for mods that increase your frame and your abilities stats.Artifacts have been renamed Auras. They are mods now and theres a special slot in every warframe that allows you to equip them. Instead of consuming mod points they increase available mod points. Polarities either double or halve the number of mod points added to the frame. This means that if you ranked a frame up to  and stuck a potato in it an Aura will push you above  mod points as far as . Equipping a maxrank Aura on an Unranked frame also makes early leveling easier as you can equip a lowranked Redirection andor Vitality from the outset.There are quests now you can activate them in the codex to run a series of interconnected missions. It looks like going forward new frames are going to be implemented using this system and old frames may eventually get their own quests retroactively added. It has its pros and cons but overall I like it better. The added lore is nice the missions feel more important and occasionally have extra quirks. The best part is that you only have to do them once and youre guaranteed the items you want. Even though you have to build each part before the quest will let you get the next part Id rather have a reason to come back and play Warframe for the next two weeks as opposed to spending all day killing Sargas Ruk backtoback then  hours to assemble all the pieces then log in for a minute just to claim the parts and set the frame to build for the next three days. The missionbuildmissionbuild structure pads out the length of these quests but it gives you a reason to come back. It works like a daily dose of Warframe story and the stories are actually pretty neat.That brings us to Kubrows who are acquired through a quest. Yes you want a Kubrow.Its not really a spoiler to tell you that youre going to be stealing a Kubrow egg from their dens on earth raising your little one to be less ugly than its biological parents and then performing a riteofpassage with them once they reach adulthood. Every Kubrow feels personal to me even when they didnt all grow up to be thick and fluffy with a lotus symbol on their head.From a gameplay perspective they work like bigger tougher harderhitting meleeonly revivable sentinels. The biggest downside is that only one breed of Kubrow has an ability comparable to Guardian which means that youre going to have to actually pay attention to what youre doing or things might down you.You have  Kubrow breeds typically chosen at random Raksa the Kubrow that refills your shields. My favorite breed though pretty much default in every way Huras the Kubrow who functions like Shade. nuff said. Sahasa the loot Kubrow. Theyll dig up ammo energy health credits... just random stuff every once in a while. They also get some kind of grapplefinisher ability as well but its nothing too fancy. Many people dislike this breed but for those lootminded players you can equip a generic lockeropening ability as well and really get some extra stuff out of a mission. Sunika ostensibly the combat Kubrow. I forget what the actual abilities for this one are I dont think theyre actually as useful as the lore or their descriptions would imply. This one doesnt buff you hide you or give you loot is all Im saying.Thats all separate from the look of the Kubrow which may be short tall thick skinny or some kind of crazy llamalooking thing. You can buy and trade genetic imprints of your Kubrow to try and influence the appearance and breed of your next Kubrow. If you somehow manage to snag a big thick Kubrow with the lotus pattern out of random hatching those imprints will sell for serious platinum. Bear in mind that you can only make two imprints of any given Kubrow ever and also that you need two imprints from any source in order to successfully hatch a Kubrow influenced by those traits. You can also view your owned imprints so if for any reason you lose or sell your Kubrow to the lotus you can still view them whenever you want via the genetic imprint.Gameplaywise Id say get one. While they may be weak when unranked they will eventually grow into monstrous killing machines. You should view your Kubrow as a longterm investment they will require multiple forma and upkeep via gene stabilizers in order to remain healthy and reach their full potential. With that said a multipleforma potatoenhanced Kubrow with upgraded mods becomes one of the toughest entities in the game. The Maul ability sends their slash damage through the roof easily  dealing  damage before even being fully upgraded. Their base stats are higher than sentinels by the time they hit Rank  before mods. Link Armor Link Health and Link Shields all add a percentage of your shields to your Kubrow meaning that the tougher you are the tougher your Kubrow becomes. Whats crazy about these mods is that they actually go beyond !When equipped with fullyupgraded Link mods your Kubrow has  of your shield value  of your armor value and  of your health value added to their shield and health values!Granted its a serious investment to get your mods ranked that high or to polarize your lil buddy enough times to equip a bunch of highranked mods but you get out of them what you put into them. Ive heard rumors of people with Kubrows that oneshot enemies well into T content the highestlevel content in the game.To end on the top tier frames its really not a big deal who you choose. Frames are typically Flavors of the Month and most of them fill some sort of niche. Loki is and always has been a great frame for lategame staying invisible and casting Radial Disarm. Frost is always in high demand for Defense missions at all levels of play. Nyx has fantastic crowd control shes a little on the squishy side but she can get by in content of any level because her  and  distract all the enemies. Her  works as a panic button allowing you to soak up unlimited damage and then reflect it. Rhino hasnt changed much at all in two years so hes still just as solid of a choice as he ever was. The difference is that now he absorbs X damage in one cast instead of unlimited damage immunity over a duration. Mesa is one of the current Flavors of the Month shes a gunslinger whose ultimate locks her in place while she does some kind of crazy matrixstyle trickshots to instakill enemies she has LOS to. Its pretty OP at range but youll get downed really fast if enemies land their shots or a melee enemy gets in close enough to smack you.Honestly dont let this massive wall of text discourage you. Jumping right back into Warframe should be relatively smooth and the ingame community should be just as friendly as the subreddit in answering your questions. If you dont want to brave Region chat try going to the Larunda Relay node on Mercury to ask some players questions in the Relay chat. Half the people there just use it as a chatroom with avatars they of all people should be the most open to answering newreturning player questions.EDIT If by mod crafting you mean transmutation then just ignore that. Fusion should be your main use for duplicate mods and fusion cores. You used to need a separate mod for every single frame and weapon. Now you only need one. If you have a Serration or a Redirection you can equip that same mod on every single frame or weapon you own. You can use Fusion to rank up that mod. This consumes mod cards or Fusion Cores in order to increase the effectiveness of a given mod. Be aware that this also increases the number at the top of the card which means you need more mod points on your frame in order to equip it.,Warframe,cr2qsb9,5,t5_2urg0

3920673,0,t3_35bprk,I think the only lore wise sane reason a corpus crewman wouldnt fear the possibility of a tenno attack until they witness one is this.A tenno has no revives and is stuck with the frame it was found in. And they all start how we all started I feel as if that very few tenno would live to the point of most players do now. How ever that doesnt realy change the fact that pretty much no one sane would want to be in a Crewmans Grineers position of facing a tenno no matter the chances of it being a tenno with  hour of combat experience.Dam makes me feel sad for corpus civilians back at the gravidus Dillema like imagine thousands just hearing that the Tenno just took a bribe and slaughtered all hope of your escape from mars and not knowing how long until the grineer show up to deal with you and your friends and relatives thats why I never side with the grineer in invasions.,Warframe,cr36yd1,3,t5_2urg0

3925949,0,t3_35dnnv,Im thinking the middle ground here with this star chart nonsense would be to have  nodes.SET mission nodes for the bosses core factions planets and only have some of them go random. Have Relays and Specific alerts be separate nodes so in reality we would have something like ?  mission  relay and  alert  for events probably breaking down those  mission nodes to one for each planet set nodes and  rotating nodes. So every planet would have a dropdown for the node for anything applicable on that planet asteroid base or hostile environment survivals ext. or you could condense the  planets down to tilesets in generalugh. archwing is the real problem with this though. Im guessing add a layer to the dropdown to see if you want to go archwing or not would probably be best.This would still be a bit cluttered but not NEARLY as bad as it is now. Keep in mind this is my attempt to play devils advocate and find some sort of middle ground on steves idea.,Warframe,cr3slf9,1,t5_2urg0
3926361,0,t3_35ety3,Ive got two posts on this which explain the problem.Theyre tring to hide the grind immensely and make this game so random that its beyond ridiculous.  What theyre doing here is a random daily event that they have control over without people working on what they want.  The rewards given the tilesets given everything is DE controlled.  So the experience of this roller coaster is that DE expects you to like the pain of a long grind which harms far more than it helps.  Need money?  We dole out a bit of it and if you miss the treasure chest too bad for you.Want to go for a Frost Prime part?  Well no we took it out of circulation and get to decide when the chassis falls out.Want to go for a certain boss fight like Mesa?  Put in x the RNG and you better not miss the opportunity we gave you in having her or else!All theyve done repeatedly is hide the grind and think that people wont call them out on the bullshit scamming theyre doing.  I dont NEED to collect everything but DE has a ton of ways to go about this issue without going to the same thing in the bag of tricks which keeps getting them caught in the first place.STOP PUTTING IN RANDOM NUMBER GENERATORS FOR THINGS PEOPLE DONT WANT AND FIX THE THINGS PEOPLE DO WANT!!!Its honestly that simple.  Why not tell a story about Primes and their release?  IE you get an opportunity to change your regular into a prime after rank .  But the requirement is for it once a year with your most used Frame.  Then a story unfolds about that particular WarFrame based on your experience.Why not fix something like that instead of diminishing the star chart and giving us more of what people already rejected in other circumstances?The more they push for this the more they start looking like Wildstar and thats going to be the day that DEs Golden Goose is beyond cooked...,Warframe,cr3ua75,6,t5_2urg0

3936998,0,t3_35j4rm,Probably to avoid power creep and actually give some utility to some of the less powerful weapons and give them purpose again.Like you said or meant I think no one would use a single Bolto despite it having an advantage in both accuracy and reload time. Even considering the fact that Akboltos fire faster than you can click the advantages are simply not enough to justify use of a single Bolto. So DE gave players a reason to use it.I put  forma on my Furis pistol and it can whomp pretty much the entire star map while practically refilling my health with every landed shot. Dont forget those syndicate effects are quite powerful in their own right. When Im using a high damage caster frame like Ember I usually have a syndicate weaponmod equipped for the buffs and powerful ranged procs.For the record I seriously think that a Dex Furis with a Winds of Purity mod would be OP. Not being sarcastic. You can turn Dex Furis into a very respectable sidearm without much effort something that is more difficult and requires more investment with the Furis.,Warframe,cr51wb0,1,t5_2urg0

3941005,0,t3_35lbrt,Since Nova Prime Access came out the following weapons have been released Soma Prime Centaur Fluctus Imperator Vandal Tipedo Panthera Prisma Gorgon AkJagara Prisma Veritux Ether Dagger kind of Tonbo Kohmak Ripkas Dex Dakra Dex Furis again kind of Aksomati Dual Razas and Tonkor.Based on the weapons you gave as examples Im assuming you meant more are any of the new weapons super crazy powerful since most of the weapons in the game are worth investing into if you like them. The answer to that is ehhhhhhh. From that list Id say the only truly must have weaopns are Tipedo Tonbo I think? Tonkor until they maybe probably nerf it and Soma Prime. If you want Tipedo for just its best mobility in the game because there are better damage based polearms out there I havent even put a potato on mine and I use it just fine since all you need is Fury and maybe Berserker if you like hitting walls. Tonbo Im unsure about but Ive heard that its kind of like a harder hitting Orthos Prime but take that as you may and it may not be true. Then like others have said Tonkor is just a ridiculous powerhouse albeit slightly difficult to use easily due to its  shot magazine.

We introduce time in the D projection just to show different aspects of the intersection.Basically the Hypercube exists in a D geometric space it doesnt change with time.Its projection in the D space is shown in the model however depending on how and where the D space intersects with the D space the projection we see changes. So the D model  time is required to see how the projection changes by changing with time the way the  spaces intersect.Say if you have a cylinder intersecting a D space a plane depending on how the cylinder moves in respect to the space the projection will change say rotation around the short axis of the cylinder from a circle to various ellipsis to a rectangle and back to ellipsises and again a circle roughly probably there are intermediate phases Im missing.,Warframe,crmd6xe,1,t5_2urg0

4099668,0,t3_37kgxe,. Wrong. Every single frame and weapon you can buy for Platinum is also grindable. Only some frames require you to do quest or clan research to get the parts and blueprints needed.. Only very few weapons drop from bosses Seer Miter Twin Gremlin Cronus Brakk Detron Hate Dread and Despair. Soon Nef Ano will also be dropping his axeampshield.. Wiki is your Bible your guide and your friend. Yes Warframes differ in powers and base stats mostly. Some of them have some hidden bonuses though. Like Zephyr that has lower mass or Mesa that has some cool bonuses to some weapons and has higher health if she doesnt equip a melee weapon.. The most common mistake is buying anything besides Warframe Slots and Weapon Slots for starter Platinum. The other common mistake is wasting Catalysts for weapons that are to say the least subpar. Bows are really really good but niche since you are swarmed by masses of fast enemies so a singletarget weapons will always be less desireable than spraynpray ones.. Close range combat is viable but hard to master and mostly requires certain hightier weapons and certain frames with certain builds. Its not more viable than range combat though. You can do missions sword alone but what for if you can do the same thing ten times faster spraying enemies with bullets.,Warframe,crnl5h5,1,t5_2urg0

Dont be absurd.gtAll of the glitches where enemy gets stuck inside a wall  Ive had plenty this week.Thats not a gameplay mechanic.gtNot needing to do costly simulation of flow for skills where flow matters  stuff like Miasma unlike BlindJavelin should be able to hit enemies behind cover and trying to do it through punchthrough will result in inconsistencies like enemies diagonally behind cover not getting hit.This not only isnt a gameplay mechanic but its not even an implementation issue given my sizable recent playtime with excal and dealing with his LOS changes.gtTeammate has crouched behind an obstacle to not get hit by enemy fire. SUPRISE NO BLESSING FOR YOU.Teammate walked through a door encountered detron crewman door closed behind him. SURPRISE NO BLESSING FOR YOU.Maybe trinity shouldnt be leading the charge? Maybe in risky situations the group should stay grouped? Literally none of the surprises you listed would be surprises to someone who is halfway awake while they play the game. I realize that this may be something of a paradigm shift since most gameplay right now lends itself toward zzzzzzzrolling but its a worthwhile change to make.gtWarframes healing is already pretty gimped it doesnt need to be made worse by LoSing Blessing  instead more methods of healing need to be added that bridge the gap between health orbs and TrinLife Strike.I dont even disagree here. LoSing skills isnt being suggested to gimp healing though which is what youre implying. There should be more support options given to frames no question. Those options shouldnt encourage teams to stick someone in a closet and hit the save party button once in a while.gtYoure welcome to persuade DE to revert Iron Skin to flatout invulnerability.but that would be a terrible idea! No skills should grant flatinvulnerability that sound you just heard was a dozen valk players REEEEEEEEEEing at their computersgtThen Ill think about getting surrounded by enemies which collectively can do far more damage per second than current Iron Skin can ever withstand. This is literally only an issue at m on tt endless or maybe m on lower towers. If you arent able to kill enemies in tint before they tear through your rhino skin put mods on your mk braton or something I dont even know.gtAlso Im pretty sure some AoE things already work through LoS  like Arson EximiFire Blasts wall of fire. Its pretty hilarious when player evades one by moving behind a tiny pole... and pretty frustrating when enemy does the same.That happened a lot when they first implemented LOS. It does not happen any more Ive tried plenty of times in tower defense missions. Im open to being proven wrong if you have a vod of that happening on the current build though.It looks like your only actual gameplay mechanic justification for LOS skills is that one enemy is hard to the point of being unbalanced I will  agree so you want to be able to kill every enemy through walls. If thats the main thrust if your argument we might just have to agree to disagree.edit also holy wow at the downvotes on all sides in this thread.

4271979,0,t3_39wtc1,I would highly recommend Mirage as she is a very easy frame to obtain as all you have to do is complete the Hidden Messages Quest. Nothing particularly grindy to do to get her.And once you have Mirage any and every weapon you have becomes several times stronger especially if you invest into power strength and Hall of Malevolence. Mirage has hilarious scaling with many of the AoE weapons. However going down this route will cause your team utility to take a huge dip.However you can instead chose to build Mirage for team utility by getting Total Eclipse and Natural Talent in order to buff your teammates and be able to keep the enemy blinded respectively.Irregardless Hall of Mirrors will lend you unnatural resilience as many enemies will target your doppelgangers instead of you. I run Mirage in T to T content and can comfortably solo them even running defensive mods without Redirection Vitality or Quick ThinkingYOLO. It is however much safer to have them though T is a whole other thing though unfortunately I am not so experienced with running T in general so I am unable to give much advice to you regarding that matter.,Warframe,cs763rj,5,t5_2urg0

Good question. I should have and had I known that was the only way I probably would have. But as you said yourself that does not excuse the problem.still not an excuse to be angry at everything else.I was not angry at everything else. I was angry at having streamed a black screen instead of an intro and I was angry at not being given the basic features I expect in any game. ie. The quit to desktop option.

4320021,0,t3_3agpeu,I have a bad feeling thisll turn into another doom thread.Look everyone please just remember that we dont truly know how this functions its positives or its negatives. If youve got concerns try asking him instead of getting angry at stuff we still dont know much about....What we can assume and discuss is another story entirely!!! With a lot of people here in the comments saying that blue star is something relating to the sentients we can see much more clearly a progression of planets outward from the sun Mercury to this supposed lategame sentient stuff. I like this mostly because the first star chart was all... jumbled aside from when you zoomed in to the nodes and saw the connections and paths etc our current star chart is just a clockwise turntable but this new star chart seems to group things in a plainly visible progression. A direction were all headed toward as players.Kinda like the chart from Starfox itll give a clear view of planets that are sorta on the same difficulty level as one another? I dunno it just gave me that vibe....All in all might compliment the new star chart system pretty well. There might be fewer active nodes and missions at any given time but theyll be grouped easily into where a player should be with how strong they are in the game... With newer players playing comfortably in the inner core as a sort of training grounds until they feel theyve leveled up and attained enough modsexperience to try their hand in the Proto Expanse maybe even branching off into some extra missions at Arcadia. My feeling is that MOST of the playerbase will be sitting comfortably together in the Outer Volatiles whereas players at the top of their game or players looking for a challenge will brave the Exo SpurgyfklOooh mystery People are assuming its Exo Space but I dont know how anyone can see past that bloom...I like these assumptions. I dont think itll end up being a matter of limited choice so much as itll be wow look at all these excess nodes nobody plays on we should clean house.HOWEVER... With newer players not yet having access to void keys important nodes or other things that the averagelategame player actually uses to spend their time in Warframe... I can see new players getting bored very quickly. Lets just say theres  or  nodes in the Inner Core for example they said thered be  on the star chart at any given time if I recall...? once a new player clears those  or  missions they may not be ready in terms of gameplay experience or gear to move onto the next region causing them to get stomped on some of the nodes. This will have them replaying those first  or  nodes over and over... Whereas in the current starchart they have a ton of nodes theyll be clearing for a sense of progressionaccomplishment and by the time they clear them theyre usually ready for the next area. This isnt a huge difference to the grind but its the difference between thinking I have to replay this mission over and over until Im ready or Im completing all these missions on my way to being ready....But even with that being said all these excess nodes that theyre clearing can get long dreary and boring because NOBODY is playing them. Think do you go back to those forgettable nodes and play them again? No youd only go back to something like Apollodorus Tolstoj and maybe a few others. Theres no public players to join and play with on this long journey of clearing nodes unless you come in with a friend or ask in the recruiting chat. It makes new player progression long lonely and boring. But new player progression with fewer nodes could also be grindy lonely and boring....So I sincerely hope DE has looked at this possibility and has something up their sleeve for it. Possibly more quests? As of right now Vors prize does put them on their feet Once Awake will occupy them too Howl of the Kubrow... erm... might keep them busy. But we might need an extra one honestly.TLDR Clearly visible direction amp player progression itll help clean off all the excess nodes experience for hooking new players into the game still might be a concern.,Warframe,csclfyg,11,t5_2urg0

4337027,0,t1_csei6aq,Eh some of them are really naff but others are quite good. The Hek has amazing burst damage and status chance with its syndicate mod the reload speed does hinder its sustained DPS though the Boar Prime is also a status machine and can deal very impressive burst DPS as well the Strun Wraith also spews out status procs and is a very fun shotgun to use in general and the Drakgoon is a flak cannon that can deal some impressive damage with its charged attack. The Kohm was also a beast back when I used it but I havent used it since the latest nerfschanges. For machine guns the Soma and Soma Prime are some of the best rifles in the game if you build them for crit the Boltor Prime hits like an absolute truck no gimmicks just shittons of raw damagethe Latron series are quite powerful semiautomatic rifles with some very nice crit stats although the Prime variant can only be obtained via trade chat now. and the Attica is a very hard hitting fullyautomatic crossbow that can be modded to shoot explosive bolts. For highpowered rifles the Opticor is the king of single target damage boasting an impressive  base damage for its fully charged attack. Its not a particularly fast weapon but it can oneshot most enemies in the game up to ludicrous levels. The Vectis is also quite a powerful sniperrifle although it feels more like a boltaction rifle with its single round magazine thats a lot of fun to play with and the bows are arguably the hardest hitting singletarget weapons in the game because of their amazing crit stats. ,Warframe,cseigy8,1,t5_2urg0
4339920,0,t3_3apfub,The best way Ive found to get the Nova P Chassis is to go  minutes. For some reason there is a much better chance of them rolling on everything past  minutes. Now heres the trick how to do it bring along a full squad and have each person take a Dragon Key. I spent the entire double drop weekend farming ODS and this method was the absolute most effective one that I came up with. Once you get into the game rush to find the vault. When you open it and claim the corrupted mod it will start spawning TT void enemies instead of infested. Then its just as simple as having a squad that can clear void enemies and keep up the life support. Side note Before coming up with that strategy I had run about  hours worth of  minute ODS runs and had not gotten a single prime part. Over the entire weekend of running  and  minute runs I came out with  Nova P chassis and  Burston P Barrels. So the longer you stay the better shot you have.,Warframe,cseu7ts,1,t5_2urg0

4358315,0,t1_csgwbw3,Lets agree to disagree then its just opinions after all. I still think that its possible to bring Ash to another level like pretty much every other warframe. What i suggest will lead to different playstyle of course its just what i personally prefer. It will also require much more work from developers than tweaks and balancing to current powerset.As for tweaks to his current abilities instead of full revamp which is easier to implement i believe additional range and longer duration for stagger effect of Smoke Bomb will definitely make it more useful. It should also open enemies for stealth finishers by default and i think that multitakedowns should be added  it will help in many instances right now performing finishers on few enemies successively is quite annoying. Teleport should be able to automatically target enemiesallies closer to reticle aiming at someone specific could be problematic sometimes.  Teleporting from group to group bombing and finishing them after... uh now it sounds like Bladestorm   Bladestorm... what do you think about this ability? If you ask me id say that this holographic clones addition makes no sense and doesnt fit his theme. Well at least ability is stronger now and melee multiplier is reasonable addition too  helps with scaling. Main problem with Bladestorm is that it negates other abilities theres some kind of conflict why bother with Shuriken Smoke Bomb and Teleport if you can save this energy for Bladestorm which can easily clear whole room? You must choose between fun and efficiency here. Its  different playstyles that collide with each other theres no synergy between Ash ultimate and other abilities.  I think replacing it with something else could solve this issue and make Ash more interesting.

4398522,0,t3_3behqw,its like you guys dont remember what the game was like less than a year agorep farm and all of that is what got viver then cerberus and now draco into the spotlight. interception farming was always pretty good with aoe compositions because of the amount of eximus spawns but people were fine just doing DSD insteadbefore rep farming we were okay with it taking longer to max rank  forma level weapons. mostly because not a whole lot of people knew any better but still. the whole viver thing just gave more players a chance to get in on the affinity trainso long as there is a need daily to grind out affinity players will continue to find the most optimal route. as players weve clearly communicated past all of DEs attempts to nerfban behavior that we PREFER to do mind numbingly nothingness for  minutes to cap out as opposed to  hours of whatever exterminate missions.so as long as a Trial the hardest content in the game takes  minutes on average and only nets lt rep... as long as exterminate deception hijack etc only bring in less than  rep... as long as my daily cap of rep is  and formas completely reset all my ranks to ... I will continue to look for the fastest option out of all the shitty ones that remain.

Okay what do I have?  Valkyr?  Cool melee.  Lets do some Infestation if its available.  Cool theres an infestation on Saturn.  Do three or four rounds of that.  This is getting boring.  I dont wanna play coop anymore lets do some stealth.  Exterminate missions on Jupiter!  Paris Kunai etc.  Fun fun fun.  Hey I think I need something to replace my dual Zoren.  Lets go shopping!  Ooh look a whip!  What do I need for the Lecta?  These things? Okay!  Lets go to this planet and do a couple defense missions.  Et cetera.  Hey I have what I need! Cool I got a whip! Now lets use it so that my actual skill at using it increases alongside its power so its even better than if I power leveled it. et cetera.I have this quasiADD mentality that makes the game really enjoyableI cant ever decide what to do so I just do random stuff.  Im not lacking for credits or resources or anything really.  I just enjoy the gameplay enough to the point that I can play any mission except Spy fuck spy missions and have a good time not worrying about farming.  Ill do an alert when it pops up because why not.  Ill put my time into the events done the tactical alert  or  times just because and get some cool stuff from it.  I end up exploring in the game.

4409466,0,t3_3bj24h,First I would change Accelerant  to give less impressive damage bonus like  instead of current  but additionally fire damage would ignore armor and shields on all enemies affected by Accelerant. I believe it would make Embers damagedealing power scalable for higher level enemies to some extent.Second current WoF augment should become default part of the abilitiy instead of being an augment. Id say knocking down enemies on top of dealing damage is not too OP for a ultimate ability. And like others said energy drain and duration scaling is completely retarded. DE really should pick one  either drain or duration.Third even with an augment Fire Blast is kinda meh. The best thing that could be done with Fire Blast is to remove this ability for good and make something new preferably something that would boost Embers survivability.

While I still believe that its better to balance out the weaknesses of your primary physical damage type thats because I dont like screwing with my mod loadouts much and thats a personal decision. There are definitely a decent selection of weapons which would gain more raw damage from the physical damage event mods than they would from  elemental mods.

Ill add some notes that communicate these assumptions in the document better... But for starters all Endless missions are assuming x rotation up to C which consists of x A x B x C. For all intents and purposes  key   run up to C.However what I completely forgot to do was factor in and note the assumption that x Sabotage key  x Caches found. Which means you get two rolls of the drop table not one. What this means is that T Sabotage reclaims the throne as the best short key to use for grinding Ducats. This also improves the Ducat per minute count assuming  minutes average to find all  caches and complete mission. But in that land the T Capture remains king.,Warframe,ct28wbl,11,t5_2urg0

4577976,0,t1_ct7k3m7,The thing is when you move around too much the enemy spawns get all fucked making finding them in order to kill them much harder more time consuming and overall less efficient.My point about stacking life support is that it is possible to optimise your killing volume to such a point where you dont need to activate the consoles. This means that when you really really need the consoles because you can no longer kill enemies fast enough or your team members are down and need reviving so time is wasted not killing they are all there and can be used. A full backlog of LS will last you a good  or more minutes which is perfect for when you can survive the enemies but cant kill them.This whole game is about being lazy really. Its about optimising and refining gameplay aspects and equipment setups to be the most efficient.

On top of that they have to keep in mind to not make frames too op thus making the game less challenging. I actually like frames the way they are now having a team of different frames adds a unique challenge to the mission. Yeah Nyx is pretty good in defense missions with her chaos and any team but put her in a spy mission with the same team and you have to work with your team to complete the mission. Instead of just finding the most op abilities you can find within your skill group and spam. The select skills each frame comes with adds more of a teamwork element to this coop game. But if the devs add this power kit why work with a team when you can pretty much solo any mission by just spamming everything.,Warframe,ct85r8r,1,t5_2urg0

As you can see no bad luck involved in fact you wouldve been pretty lucky to get it with so many less tries than youre expected to need. The probability to not get it in those  tries was  .. So yeah absolutely no inducement to complain about bad luck here.You could complain about the reward chance itself if you want but personally I think expecting   tries on a mission to get the new stuff is not unreasonable.

4633973,0,t3_3eg4ab,I used to love Valkyr I have her potatoed and with one or two forma and I left her with a nice build. I moved on to some other frames. Rhino prime loki prime Frost prime Ash prime and a few more. I came back to Valkyr for a few missions the other day after using and optimising these other frames and quite honestly I felt Valkyr wasnt up to scratch. She didnt hold the DPS or team utility that the other frames offered.Quite simply I couldnt see any shine in her. Its understandable that your team mates would not want a Valkyr in their team for the raid. The raid is not about killing its about keeping your team mates alive and the enemies controlled but not necessarily dead. The only thing Valkyr does well is keeps herself alive. She offers nothing else to the team and the only other bonus is hysteria which to me after coming back to her is so much less powerful than it felt before I tried other frames. Valkyr is loved by the community but she doesnt really have a place in raids. She is a great frame but there are better things in the long run. Raids require more of a focus on team power rather than individual power and Valkyr isnt very good at spreading the love to the team.,Warframe,cteojkz,1,t5_2urg0

4787306,0,t1_ctxvxdb,gtI just got Sonic Fracture for Banshee the one that strips  of armour off enemies and combined with just one corrosive projection it takes off  of armour.Sonic Fractures debuff is based off the enemys current armor level while Corrosive Projection works off of the maximum possible armor based on level. Supposing an enemy has  armor CP takes off  and leaving  armor ingame. Sonic Fractures debuff removes  of that enemy armor leaving  armor remaining on the target. Now if you had  power strength then you can remove the armor in one application.For short range proc spamming I cant recommend anything more than the Boar Prime with a high RoF with Viral  Fire damage. Barring that you can achieve  status chance with the Vaykor Marelok with  status mods. Other good guns for status spamming include the Glaxion Torid Phage and Tigris. Id try to focus on Viral damage since most enemies have a  or  vulnerability to it along with the  health debuff.

4867037,0,t3_3hjj50,My first tome trading was somewhat similar. I had been playing  days and had just got some parts for a Scindo Prime. Was just missing the blueprints and  Orokin Cells. I hit up the trade asking for offers.Start talking with one guy that was asking for  plat. Ok that works. He asks me to invite. I just sent him a party invite and didnt know to go to the dojo. So we cover that step and invite to my dojo. We go back and forth about how I am new and not very experienced at this.After a few missteps we finally get the trade started. I try and put  platinum in the trade window... damn why does it say . I know I have plenty of my starter ... he has already put my bp in the window. He realizes what is going on and tells me you cant spend starter plat. facepalmJust give me a mod or something.... I am hesitant because I wasnt looking for handouts or anything. I give him a spare vitality and before I can accept he throws  other things up in the window. He says Sell these if you want some platinum you can use. Just be sure to check trade for what they are going for first. D Frost prime systems and a Nova prime systems. I thought they would be something like  plat a piece and thanked him a ton. I was just psyched to get the Scindo BP which I finally got enough potatoes to build a few days ago.A day or so later I checked trade and someone posts WTB Frost Systems. I asked what he would pay for them and he said he could do .After looking up the value of the parts I got for free I ended up selling one systems keeping the other and farmed the rest of the parts for Nova. Best first trade I ever had in a game.TLDR I noobd up my first trade by trying to trade starter plat.

4882655,0,t3_3hr9eu,For details about game mechanics the wiki is your friend. It can tell you things about Novas skills like what stats affect what and so forth.For theorycrafting builds warframebuilder is your friend. It can give you details on your skills and gun stats when you put mods onto your builds as well as how many Forma will be required to max out a weapon.As for general knowledge about damage I can outline the meta for each faction at the moment hereampnbsp CorruptedInfestedGeneral Corrosive ElectricToxin  Heat  SlashCorrosive is a damage type that has decent coverage over all factions and suffers little to no damage penalties on any enemy type. It works very well on Fossilized Infested Ancients Moas etc and Ferrite Armor Heavy Gunners Ballistas etc. Heat and Slash get benefits on pretty much every Fleshy unit type such as Chargers for Infested Butchers for Grineer and Crewmen for Corpus. With this build you can face just about any faction with few penalties. This is generally on my Loadout A for all my weapons.ampnbsp Corpus Magnetic ElectricCold  Toxin  ImpactMagnetic is good for Corpus because Magnetic is very effective on shields which every Corpus unit has. Toxin goes straight through shields which allows you to cut through Crewmen who generally have very high shields but very little actual health. Impact has bonuses against shields as well but not as much as Magnetic.ampnbsp GrineerCorrupted Radiation ElectricHeat  Viral ToxinCold   PunctureRadiation cuts through Alloy armor which is worn by heavy units like Bombards and Napalms. Alloy units can output a lot of damage and Crowd Control so modding to focus them is a good idea. Viral gets bonuses on all Grineer unit health and its status proc halves the maximum health of the unit for  seconds. Puncture gets bonuses to both Ferrite and Alloy armor which is worn by various heavy units as I have mentioned before. This combination can also be used to focus Bombards in the Corrupted faction TT at the cost of taking penalties against Corrupted Ancient Healers.Note the Impact Puncture and Slash IPS mods for your weapon will only go off the weapons base damage of the same type generally making them weaker than another elemental mod. The comments about these IPS types are mostly for you to know which of your weapons has innate benefits against a faction.ampnbspAs for your specific questions    . Why do enemies do different amounts of damage?Well depending on the unit some will do lots of damage and others will not. Bombards and Napalms do a ton of AoE damage but are pretty sparse and fire very slowly. Lancers on the other hand come in droves and individually dont do much but together can add up to a lot of damage. Ballistas are snipers so they do quite a bit of damage but only at a distance. There are lots of enemies like this.Furthermore the level of the enemy has a role in how hard they hit. If you go to Mercury the enemies will tickle you but if you were to go to Ceres the same units will rip through your frame if you let them. This is why endless missions get more difficult as they go on. The enemies continually level up causing their health and damage to go up.    . Is there a right way to mod?Not really. This is especially apparent for warframes but with the Mod system in this game you can do a variety of things that are viable depending on what you want to accomplish. Guns are bit more sided but there are a few ways you can build them as well. With guns you always want your main damage and multishot mods with at least one elemental combination. Generally unless the gun has some flaws to patch up you just want to maximize damage output.    . Is Nova squishy?Yes she is a caster frame so she will be pretty squishy. She has base healthshields with little armor. You can put on some defensive mods to combat that I generally use Quick Thinking  Flow but generally your CC is what is going to keep you safe. Just remember your Molecular Prime has cast time so dont decide to cast it while a Butcher whales on you.    . Where to farmlevel?Depending on what you want to farm there could be a myriad of places to farm. For resources you generally want to run a SurvivalDefenseExcavation with a NekrosHydroid to maximize resource dropping. Dark Sectors have an increased resource drop chance so those are good farming spots. For leveling you will similarly want to run an endless mission to maximize the amount of enemies killed. You might want to familiarize yourself with the mechanics of Affinity acquisition to maximize the amount you gain for the item you plan to level.Generally if youre leveling a frame bring some good weapons so you can pull your weight. Likewise if youre leveling a weapon you should bring a strong frameanother weapon to help pull weight. Now if youre only interested in leveling a single weapon you can drop some of your other weapons so you get more affinity for that one weapon but you should be prepared to carry with your frame. TDODDSechuraDraco are popular spots for affinity gain.If you want to get affinity solo then you can try to run highlevel spy missions to get the affinity bonuses for getting the vault without being detected k affinity per vault on PlutoCeres. Generally I will run a few spies to get the first few levels out of the way then go to a void Defense to finish it off. Others tend to run a low level SurvivalDefense like Apollodorus Mercury with their unranked stuff before they move on to higher nodes to finish them off.    . Where to get mods?Most of the basic mods Intensify Streamline Continuity Flow Stretch etc for your warframe can be found from enemiesbosses on the starchart you can look these up on the wiki. For Corrupted Mods you have to do vault runs The extra Corrupted mods you get you can sell for some platinum on the Trading channel. For Nightmare Mods you will have to do Nightmare Mode missions. These are quite a bit harder than normal missions so you will want to run a fast mission type such as Deception or Sabotage to reduce the amount of time in the mission for you to mess up and die.    . Where to get credits?Dark Sectors and Void missions give a rather large credit bonus for completing them. Void captures and exterminates can be done relatively quickly and give quite a bit of credits. Popular Dark Sectors for credit farming are Sechura Seimeni and Akkad on Pluto Ceres and Eris respectively. By leaving at wave  of a Dark Sector Defense you get the full credit reward for relatively little time in mission.If you need any help you can add me braindead PC,Warframe,cu9zw0e,4,t5_2urg0

4947864,0,t1_cui7jmi,Hek and Kohm are shotguns.  Hek has a round magazine and does ridiculous damage while the Kohm has a much larger magazine and spools up to its full fire rate and is one of if not the best shotgun for sustained DPS.  Theyre both really good I usually flip between both of these depending on the mission type and faction.  Hek is puncture damage based while the Kohm is slash damage based.  Ill bring the Boar Prime if I want impact damage or if you cant get your hands on that snag the Sobek for impact.Quanta is an insanely ammo efficient held trigger dual laser primary.  It doesnt do the most damage but it can still hold its own and you should rarely if ever run out of ammo.  It has an alternate fire that shoots laser cubes that take  ammo each that can be used to AOE a small area and they do pretty high damage.  But spamming those will eat through your ammo extremely quickly if youre not careful theyre best saved for heavier targets.Atomos is a held trigger beam weapon that works similar to the Amprex where its beam will chain between enemies.  Its heat based by default which is nice but has a really short range about m.  Ruinous Extension makes the Atomos experience a million times better.Brakk is a secondary shotgun pistol made from parts that drop from the Grustrag Three.  It has a fairly short damage dropoff range but does a huge amount of damage at close range and reloads insanely quickly.Despair is a secondary Kunai that can be made from blueprints dropped by the Stalker.  If youve used either the Kunai or Hikou you know how these work.  Concealed Explosives is a new mod that gives throwing weapons Kunai Hikou Despair etc a chance to explode on impact.  Its pretty fun just dont kill yourself when using that mod.Kulstar is a cluster bomb launcher that with multishot installed Barrel Diffusion  Lethal Torrent fires  cluster bombs that explode on impact with a surface or an enemy and release submunitions that spread out and pepper the area with more explosions.  Its fun to shoot the ceiling with it if you have a large room and watch lots of little bomblets rain down.  Be careful with this thing its really easy to kill yourself with it.Dunno when the bug will be fixed its been around for a long while.

Even ignoring the fact that the mod is a drop.  Remember that were working with supply and demand here.  Even if you have  of the games supply of whatever if theres no demand then thats just assets sitting and not moving.  Vitality would be a poor choice but what about Heavy Caliber?  Somebody buying up all the stocks and selling them for p a pop would be sad but then the buyer has to consider that a good price.  If nobody buys...again assets sitting rotting.  Worse youve created an artificial shortage and theres high demand for somebody elses product provided they offer it for a lower price.  The hoarder wont be able to catch every HC that passes by.  Eventually the hoarder might be forced to lower prices because nothings moving.  Or maybe theyll stick to their guns.  There might be a race to the bottom in terms of prices but things will stabilize.  The cheap things will go fast and what players consider too expensive will sit.  People will undercut but even that has a limit.  You ever look at Steam Trading Cards price histories?  Its pretty interesting if youre looking at the right cards.  Like theres a potentiallyinfinite market with the stillgrowing number of Steam accounts but also the booster packs feature sorta like with how Warframes drops are potentiallyinfinite in nature.  CSGO is the cheapest game on Steam to make a badge and despite people wanting to sell their cards ASAP the price of each still hasnt normalized to the lowest price of  cents each.

The downside is the magazine size this is the only reason I am ever leaning to getting the vaykor hek keep in mind that for the vaykor hek to really shine you need primed ravage. If you dont have that mod get the hek and wait for primed ravage to come around and youll be happy with it. Trust me.

5262236,0,t3_3n1t96,Ive played way too much of both of these frames and to break it down in a simple fashion like others have said Loki has  ways to build him Duration build and Range Disarm build. Lokis th ability removes enemy weapons and forces them to only be able to melee until theyre dead. Theres no set duration on how long the effect lasts its until the enemy dies. With a minmaxed Disarm build with a little bit of duration to not butcher invis too much youre looking at  seconds of invisibility for  energy. If you have more than  maxed energy siphons on your team that will be selfsufficent by itself. However thats not the selling point of the build. For  energy you remove all enemy weapons in a m radius around you m if you have a special helmet thats not really important however. The other build Max duration or maxed with still the low energy cost if youd prefer is around  seconds of invisibility for the same energy cost  but on the flip side your range suffers making your Disarm only have about a m AoE. Not good for the endless missions for sure. Duration loki is OP as hell in Spy missions however. Spy missions give lots of rare mods as rewards and being able to teleport your way through a Spy vault in  seconds is just too good.Ash on the other hand is all about the damage. Bladestorm his ult targets up to  enemies and him and ish clones of himself go to town on them teleporting all around and ruining enemies days. Duration doesnt affect how many enemies you can kill with BS in one cast so most people dump as much strength as possible one which will bring duration down to  of the frames original  duration. This makes Invis on Ash more useful as a staggering effect and as others have said an Arcane exists Arcane Trickery which if youre willing to dump the timeplat into maxing it out can give you  seconds of invisibility almost every time you Bladestorm. As a bonus the stealth granted by Arcane Trickery isnt an actual Warframe power so the Stalker nullifiers and the like wont get rid of it. My personal favorite is Loki he was my first frame way back and hes just too useful to not have if you need to pick one. However Ash is good as well. Both have a x or maybe x melee damage multiplier while invisible allowing you to go to town with either. For Loki I recommend using a GlaivePrime with maxed Quick Return and Power Throw you can pop nullifer shields and clear crowds with it quite easily. For Ash any melee will work I personally dont have Arcane Trickery so I use Glaive there as well. Hope this helps you out! .,Warframe,cvkb4p2,1,t5_2urg0

Coptering was just one of the ways to move. You could choose to move differently if you wanted to.A way to move that exploited a poor design decision in a way unintended and pigeonholed melee weapons into either good for coptering or shit even if they do better damage than coptering weapons.

5334921,0,t1_cvt8k8r,Regarding overloadbansheequake change i think the only difference to his playstyle is people would use it defensively mainly or for offensive use they pop speed sprint into a group then pop it the only added change for that id added if u used the banshee method is it having a magnetic pull effect not a strong one more of like a slow pulling effect so they can just walk right by u the other added change is give Volt while in this form improved armor or a stronger shielding effect do if he gets focused he doesnt just instantly get wrecked. Kinda like diamond slin but not as good maybe. The other idea i have is make it kinda a form effect to play more with his mobility but having a similiar quake effect in u just not root him make him still mobile have be like an on off effect but still deals dmg and stuns when near id also say remove the armor value and reduce the overshield value that way u maintain the mobilitt and the concept value of VoltSrry for poor punctuation was on phone and at work,Warframe,cvtlfua,1,t5_2urg0

5349330,0,t3_3oa3c9,I would personally go with either Chroma or Valkyr if I were you. Valkyr is definitely of the tanker side cuz of her invulnerability. She also has sustain to keep her going and abilities that synergies well with melee. Im fairly sure Chroma can out damage Valkyr pretty easily and hes also extremely tanky but has no invulnerability. Problem with Chroma is he needs to ramp up to full power by taking damage and he has no sustain to counter that so youll need something like life strike winds of purity furis or health restores with him. Once he does get going though hes a fucking freight train that plows through everything in his path. Valkyr is a very safe frame to play while chroma might be a bit harder because of health and damage management with the way his ability works.,Warframe,cvvfqyh,1,t5_2urg0

5356194,0,t3_3od3bz,Id like to see Saryn truly embrace the whole poison theme shes got.Venom Keep it mostly as is but every time one of the spores is popped it triggers a Gas proc in addition to spread spores instead of dealing viral damage. This way the spores can deal viral damage with a chance for viral procs while popping the spores releases a cloud of gas that does toxin damage to everyone in the area. Make the viral status chance modified by power strength as well.Molt Perfectly fine as is I think. Its got a great utility especially with the augment.Contagion Keep it mostly as is but let it apply to all weapons not just melee weapons. I think this should probably be a separate source of damage instead of combining with other elements on the weapon. It should also have its own status chance modified by power strength. Augment Change the augment so it applies Contagion to ally weapons as well.Miasma Make this into duration based AoE cloud of corrosive damage. Enemies take damage in the cloud with each instance of damage having a high status chance. Duration should not reduce the damage per tick like it does now nor would reducing duration increase the damage. Enemy accuracy is also severely reduced as the corrosive air blocks their vision.These changes would let Saryn become a DoT and status nightmare for enemies. Hitting them with Venom would trigger Viral damage and a chance for Viral status effects while popping them would trigger Poison Clouds similar to the Gas status effect dealing Toxin damage.Using Contagion would let Saryn have a constant source of Toxin damage on her weapons attacking enemies through their armor and shields while possibly buffing her allies. Then shes got an aura of corrosive particles corroding enemy armor damaging them and reducing their accuracy.In this way she has a source of all the Toxin related damage type Gas Viral and Corrosive letting her deal out up to  different status effects while having a ride range of damage and utility powers making her a solid addition to the entire team.,Warframe,cvwbbug,9,t5_2urg0

5468647,0,t1_cwanehw,What I mean is that its easy to make someone seem guilty. in this case the player is being harassed so that the mission purposely fails and the player tells the ones harassing him to learn to play out of frustration. The harassment is taken a step further with a threat of a report for no reason.Then when the OP tells the story but perhaps misses a few minor details others reply some not reading everything and say that the OP deserves it because of saying learn to play or nice fail implying negative behaviour.This happens so much but it is overlooked.,Warframe,cwao6gx,2,t5_2urg0

5478092,0,t1_cwbrc04,I usually watch WF videos because Im looking for some kind of info usually I craft every new weapon anyway but since theres videos before I finish crafting them I would like to get some info about them and yeah lately the videos havent been very informative not as good as they could be and theres not even mention of little details that arent exactly gameplay like how the weapon itself has animations when you melee the axes spin a wheel in the middle when you melee thats a good thing that goes under the radar its effort from the people making this weapons that goes to waste but sure the gameplay part is the most important.The video doesnt really cover actual problems nor solutions it feels like people arent agreeing with me and I dont like it and if the weapon isnt as good they should just deal with it which again as much as it sounds bad when people say X weapon is bad its also rather bad when you say its not good but screw it deal with it leave it behind.I kinda of find him to contradict himself from time to time and the whole out of sync thing just doesnt sound right.Theres a reason why feedback usually is more negative than positive because when you speak about something good its just hey this is good thats about it keep up the good work while negative feedback is about someone that thinks that someone needs to be improved but then theres plenty of useless negative feedback as well.Now bad negative feedback about this new weapon is rather normal the way the stats were attributed is what you usually dont want to do and its not being unique by doing so its making it bad. Slow melee is usually bad unless its super strong thats because strong melee is balanced by being slower but status chance as it works in WF just isnt as strong to make up for the lack of speed and usually if you want to trigger status you want to be fast to keep rerolling the dice which is a good design. Making the weapon slow ends up forcing people to get even more status chance which in turn will make the weapon be weaker in raw damage so you end up creating a downhill road rather than a flat road and thats why the weapon is seen as bad the way the stats are allocated just isnt good.What I see as the core of the problem is that DE needs to make defined tiers for gear and create a medium to progress through them when tiers do exist. The game lets you ignore tiers but DE created tiers so in the end there isnt a way to classify weapons.Infested weapons are rather tierless theres no variants theres no MK. Tenno weapons have tiers MK and Prime if not others and this is a problem because theres no progression between them your Boltor wont progress to Boltor Prime they are different weapons despite being in the same family and being almost the same thing they are in different tiers when the game isnt defined by tiers which I really like how every weapon can have a chance with enough effort put in it even if they are really weak but its a problem the way it is right now.So when a new weapon comes out theres no guidelines because theres no tier for that new weapon and that is a problem that gets worse with time.I wouldnt mind having the  tiers that we have MK original weapons and side variants and then Prime and variants that are direct upgrades but they really need to define those tiers better and create guidelines for new content along with a medium to allow progression for weapons in multiple Tiers for example allow to carry over formapotato in a Boltor to a Boltor Prime because forma and potato are part of your progress through the game which right now will be wasted if you want to use a superior weapon.,Warframe,cwbvlf6,1,t5_2urg0

Then youve got to define all the mounting points for syandana and armor attachments weapon holster positions particle positions for parkour and channeling make sure there isnt too much clipping when it comes to alternate helmets and Prime danglies align emblems... eww...Its definitely possible and there are some DAMN skilled artists in our community but I think it was a wise choice to limit workshop submissions for now.,Warframe,cwi6479,12,t5_2urg0

5685251,0,t3_3syz1x,I build frost with a more utility based approach instead of damage or tanking with globe strength that scales better into late game by maximizing the use of the cc mechanics of his abilities. This style of building frost isnt very common from what Ive observed but I feel its the best build for frost into late game where enemy fire power is so strong to the point where the extra strength and armor put into the globe health is insignificant and enemy healtharmor is so high that the extra damage from strength mods are insignificant.    Some things to note about his abilities  Snow Globe        Starts with  seconds of invulnerability. During the  seconds the globe absorbs all incoming damage into the health of the snow globe. Theoretically a snow globe will always last at least about  seconds even under high enemy firepower.  seconds to absorb all damage as health and another  seconds to lose all of that health      Stackable. This means that if your energy is sustainable you can keep recasting snow globe to keep it from getting destroyed. Recasting a snow globe every  to  seconds will keep the globe alive indefinitely. You can also create a tanky globe by recasting it multiple times as the health stacks.      Upon casting freezes and REPELS all enemies caught within the snow globe outwards. This is extremely useful as an emergency button if you are caught with a situation where too many enemies are inside your globe.      Chilling globe augment Grants a  chance to freeze enemies that enters the snow globe. The augment can be useful in certain situations. Its very useful when dealing with infested or fighting in a narrow corridor as frozen enemies will block the path of other enemies from entering the globe. I personally like this augment and uses it.    Ice Wave      Ice Wave Impedance augment Creates an icy floor for a certain duration that slows down all enemies that walks over it. Similar to the icy floor that can be found in the void. The slowness effect can be stacked with the slowness effect from snow globe. Its very useful for slowingstopping enemies in their tracks especially in tight areas. I personally really like this skill for both its use and the fact that ice wave looks cool.    Avalanche       Deals damage and freezes enemies for a duration. Frosts ultimate. CC wise not very useful for the amount of energy it costs to freeze enemies. Its useful as a nuking skill if you go for a damagestrength build but I feel that given its slow casting animation there are other nuke skills from other frames that performs much better than avalanche.    As such my build is strengthless and is focused on range efficiency and duration. The mods I use are Chilling globe Ice wave impedance Redirection Stretch Overextended  Streamline  Fleeting expertise Narrow minded OR Primed continuity OR Constitution. Overextended can be swapped out in place of a duration mod or be compensated by using Narrow Minded and Overextended together.  This build gives a huge range on ice wave snow globe and avalanche giving you a lot of crowd control. The duration on ice wave and avalanche is pretty decent as well.      Do note that this build is based mostly on my opinion and playstyle. Feel free to criticize it if theres anything you disagree with.,Warframe,cx1t6ob,1,t5_2urg0

5791541,0,t3_3uh6ql,My recommended progression from where you are would be Volt if you have clan research accessmakes missions go a bit faster. Since he isnt from a boss anymore I am recommending him as a firstframe. No grind needed besides money run a couple T missions and youll be loaded or taxi into a Semenii dark sector run creditfarming will be the keywords you will want to look for in the recruiting chat to get on one of these and resources. Excalibur but youll need to be taxied to Pluto for that. The boss is not all that difficult to beat if you can stun lock him knockdown spam melee attack but the corpus supporting it will be strong so bring someone with you for that. Excalibur is an excellent early frame that does not need to really use much in the way of specific mods honestly Loki falls in that category but the version I use requires Loki Prime for his energy pool Rhino I am not recommending this one as an immediate target frame because the others do more to encourage dodging and using cover and that experience will help you a lot in missions later on. Hes from Venus with a relatively annoying boss to fight. Definitely want multiple people for it. Still though he helps a lot with infested where you can not necessarily dodge them since they spam melee rushes.At this point we start to get into branching off into what you like best so these are not really in order of importance.  Oberon is another good starting frame but you cant farm for him directly he drops from eximuses glowing enemies with special abilities you cant miss them in a crowd. Healing capabilities plus a nice areadenial skill that works well for defenses and other camping scenarios.  I want to say Nyx but shes another luckframe in a sense because you need to fight Phorrid for her and that thing spawns during infested outbreaks on different planets. She is better with some specific mods but she is a solid choice even by default. Make enemies kill themselves or launch their own attacks back at them. Valkyr Think rhino but as a completely dedicated tank frame. Isuee with her though is she come from an annoyingtofight boss on Jupiter and she really needs HP and armor mods to shine.  Frost Good defensive frame but not very useful vs infested because they will just charge into his globes rather than shoot at them. Another annoying boss probably the most annoying to be honest Im at MR  with just about every frame and I still have trouble with fighting him on Ceres this time. Sayrn I havent touched her since her rework but she comes from an easy boss on Sedna.  Zephyr Great frame that is both fast and has some nice defensive powers. Research frame though and you will need a ton of Oxium. If you have a decent amount though shes a great pick. Nova Can slow down large numbers of enemies or speed them up once you have access to the powerstrength decreasing corrupted mod Overextended. Comes from Europa but she is a bit fragile.  Trinity Her modified skill set is what people are looking for now and to be honest I do not even have all the mods needed to make the recommended builds. The main healer frame comes from Phobos though where you have to simultaneously fight both the Mercury and the superannoying Ceres bosses. Fun Frames These are fun to use but not all that terribly effective. Ember that one just makes me sad she used to be pretty good but that was years ago when she had a defensive skill somewhat like iron skin. Shes the frameonfire but just can not perform as well as some of the other frames mentioned. Comes from Saturn. Mag She has been underassault by nerfs for a while now which were partial warranted. Destroys corpus but thats about it. Comes from an easytobeat boss on Mars. She may be a good frame to get though in order to get the other corpusdropped frames Excal Nova. Hydroid He is fun to use if you like seeing people flop around all over the place but comes from a difficult boss on Earth. If you want ragdolling you can do that with tornadoes from Zephyr.Quest Frames These are some fairly unique and good frames but they come from quests which makes them more of a hassle to get even though it eliminates RNG from the acquisition process. Mirage Actually pretty darn good but shes a quest frame with a lot of infested missions. You will want either rhino or valkyr for it. Quite possibly the most successfully offensivegeared frame Ember is even more aggressive but is limited harshly by her fixed damage abilities. Hidden Messages is where she comes from. Limbo This is a very controversial frame because he has the ability to deny accesses to dropped items on the ground as a sideeffect of his dimensional manipulating abilities the rift universe lacks a mechanism for picking up dropped items. Some love him some despise him. Comes from the Limbo Theorem really original name right? XD Now his quest has to be done after doing the archwing quest since he has archwing missions in the quest.   Chroma This frame takes forever to build even if you have all the resources because he needs other warframes parts to build each of his parts and like any of these quest frames you can not do the mission for the next part of him until you build the bp you already have. Extremely unique in how he can vary his powerset depending on his energy color. Potentially the best tank but I am not all the familiar with him. Comes from New Strange which requires I think Lost Dreams to be completed first. Frames that require irregular ways to be acquired and built Nyx She drops from the Phorrid like I said before Ash somewhat like loki but he now he drops from grineer maniacs you will probably get some of his bps when you farm for Equinox Frame that is able to swap power sets during a mission. If you have played Super Smash Brother its analogous to the Pokemon Trader or ZeldaShiek. She can do either mass damagestun as dayform or some healing and defensive powers as night form. Comes from Uranus but she requires noless than  different dropped bps to build and you can not even do Uranus missions without archwing. Nekros Master of the undead. You have to do orokin derelict missions though in order to get the lephantis nav coordinates needed to build the key for the boss he comes from. You can farm for corrupted mods while getting the lephantis cordinates but you will need void keys to build dragon vault keys and those will wreak havoc on your stats while you are carrying one. Mesa You will need infested alad v coordinates to get her the gunslinger and those only come from infested invasions. Atlas I dont know a ton about him save that he is a real pain to get because you have to run a quest and then fight a boss several times to get his parts. They do not come from the quest itself.AlertFrames These are frames where the parts come from alerts which are limited time missions and the system is global so some part of the world always get screwed out a part by it dropping at an unreasonable time in that timezone. Vauban Pretty good frame that throws these balls around that have different effects. His parts only come from alerts. Wukong I know nexttonothing about this one since it came out just a few days ago now but the resources needed to do his clan research come exclusively from alertsthese are guaranteed to happen every day though. Warframe wiki says that the construction will require those resources as well. I am actually trying to ignore it at the moment because I do not want to get excited about something that I will not get for easily  days at this rate. I had a similar attitude for Vauban so that grind did not feel bad at all since I basically just lucked out and was on at the right times  times in like a year and got the parts.

5843258,0,t1_cxljpv9,Your ranting is getting kind of ridiculous while Excal was able to do something he wasnt designed to do it doesnt mean its the frame that needed changing it was Viver. If youre going to froth at the mouth than at least understand the situation. It shouldnt take an indepth explanation as to why a midtier frame should not be given a reactionary nerf in response to an exploit in a levels drop table and timer.  I dont care if youre a beta player or not youre conducting yourself like someone who doesnt know what theyre talking about relying on ad hominem and strawman arguments. Call it a buzzword if you want its honestly the best way of describing what you did by writing up your grandiose wall of text where you made generalizing claims of which you dont really know about.  You create this collective of people against YOUR ideal way of playing Warframe when in all seriousness its that you are incapable of seeing the big picture you claim others arent able to see. Instead you started making snap judgments of someone showing skepticism towards a group of developers that have done things in the past that even they admit were bad ideas.  In case you have forgotten this all comes from the original posting of UFOloche saying how its a bit concerning that we can start losing EXP for deaths and how DE has done some questionable things before to warrant his skepticism. Same skepticism is also warranted as to if we start to delevel from this choice in penalty. If you can wholeheartedly say that losing EXP and possible levels in a game where other players can outwardly screw you over in Void Defense runs with lasers or use other Warframe abilities to move you towards danger i.e. Vauban isnt a reason for concern than I think youre better off finding a group of other individuals that feel the same way you do so you all can form some kind of an echo chamber for yourselves to vent your elitism.

5844419,0,t3_3v9xpg,Acquiring mods is best done in the interception and defense missions.  Hyperion Thrusters and Shell Rush are the exceptions to the rule.  Hyperion Thrusters drop from locust drones although I have seen unconfirmed reports of it showing up as a reward from the defense mission as well and Shell Rush is a Corups Exterminate reward.   lays out where the parts drop for the different weapons.  Unfortunately with the rework they took away the low level endless mission on Earth.  Fortunately its fairly easy to solo speed run the mobile defense mission they replaced it with.  Id do that mission until you can get to a point where you can survive the Uranus Interception and then do your leveling there.If you have the Oxium for it Id suggest getting the Grattler amp Knux combo.  Theyre pretty solid even with just a potato and no forma.  The Grattler also has the benefit of punching through the Dagryns shields which youll probably grow to hate doing the Uranus Interception.,Warframe,cxlqa9t,2,t5_2urg0

Beyond that if you let your buffs drop odds are you are going to explode in lots of situations. Warframe is not nice to the concept of playing tank.  So the combination of having to keep buffs up and watch timers while still doing stuff and potentially getting hosed by nullifiers makes me go with Chroma for most difficult warframe as these are difficulties he faces in every game mode solo or grouped it doesnt matter its always there.  ,Warframe,cxpyr7t,1,t5_2urg0

5998264,0,t1_cy5cd19,There are definitely problems with the game. Hell Nezha as a new frame should have some scaling and he has absolutely none I for one hope that they address that quickly because if they dont it will likely be a long time before he sees a rework which will fix it. A frame tied to Sorties was already an awful idea but since his acquisition is endgame based they should at least make sure hes not Oberon tier.But anyway... You agree with the Mesa nerf but you think Mag is in a bad state? In my eyes aside from the obviously OP frames... Im looking at you Trinity Wukong and Valkyr... I think mag is one of the better ones. Greedy pull was definitely making things a little too convenient for people but without it she is still a great frame even against noncorpus she is in a much better position than A LOT of frames. That said they nerfed pull as a priority but Trinity still has access to almost a full set of game breaking abilities so Im not sure what their thought process is when it comes to balance.,Warframe,cy5wiwz,1,t5_2urg0

6026994,0,t1_cy9dcnm,Then there would be no reason for transference if the link was strong enough to cause enough pain on death to kill the operator. Wouldve made sense for it to have a failsafe then assign the current Operator to another Warframe.Ill concede that we dont know what happens to the operator however. Though it is possible as because its a second dream All the experience and memories accumulated while using said Warframe would be lost as the operator goes back into sleep before dreaming again in a new Warframe as if hisher previous life was just a dream.Perhaps it causes the operator to reset back into a blank slate and heshe needs to redevelop another personality essentially being a different person.At the same time Mirage seemed to be immensely powerful. While we can barely handle one Sentient maybe two at a time Mirage was tearing through entire scores of them even as she ran out of energy she did so with her bare hands.While this wouldnt be unusual for a Warframe like Rhino or Valkyr Mirage was more of a Trickster a gunner. Perhaps this was before transference and as such she could unleash her full potential recall the operator using void beams to completely obliterate the Sentients in the Second Dream.But who knows.,Warframe,cy9nrpy,2,t5_2urg0

6033478,0,t1_cyahfi4,To clarify Nothing new would be available via tokens. That compounded by the fact it would take at least  weeks to unlock most things excluding a stockpile which would require more weeks to fill would allow DE to profit off of new items. The periods I gave to define what is new could always be adjusted to whatever they think better matches their internal data of conversion rates given a period of time. It might be that their sales of a new item wane after two weeks it might be after a month.Ive tried my best to tune token acquisition to reflect the idea that you should be able to cap out at your leisure over the course of a week but I definitely could use the perspective of someone like you to help me find a better balance there. To me I think somewhere between  hours spent on a given thing in a week Void Sorties Archwing would be considered fair to balance the acquisition and rewards around. Inevitably it will be another form of grind but I want it to be one that happens without you putting any thought into it.

The Red Veil are crazy and stupid enough to pull that but it doesnt really jive with anyone else. And that said it irks me that Tenno wouldnt pull together and the Lotus would just ignore a transgression against them like that. You know what we do to everything else that tries to murder us for any reason? Leave them in a pool of their own blood.It seems to me that there are simply smarter ways to go about having negative rep with a syndicate though I question occasionally if theres even any rational point to having negatives associated with bad syndicate rep besides the grind itself. Arent the point of syndicates to give us cool content to access and isnt the rep capgrind enough to make that work as a system in and of itself?

6083051,0,t3_3yv3id,Progression is up to you as the player. Youll want to clear missions you havent done yet and collect resources and mods. If you get to a new planet or a mission thats too tough for you go back to a different mission for a little while. Heres some basic tips for starting out. Unlock Coba on Earth. Its an infested dark sector defense mission completing the mission even after  waves will give you a credit bonus just for completing it.. Unlock Lares and Apollodorus on Mercury. Lares is a defense mission that has some unique mod drops at  waves that most other missions dont have. Apollodorus is a survival mission thats good for leveling up gear and farming new mods and resources.. Learn how to upgrade your weapons and warframe. Using and Fusing mods is very important to becoming more powerful allowing you to travel further in the game.. Look over the blueprints in the market specifically ones for primary secondary and melee weapons. Nearly any of them are upgrades to your starting weapons. Before buying them make sure you have access to the resources youll need to craft the weapon.   . There are also a few weapons in the primarysecondarymelee weapon sections that cost credits and dont have a build time. Anything listed as MK is a starter weapon and probably wont be better than what you already have.. If youre not in a clan look for one thats beginner friendly. A good amount of warframe players are the helpful type and may assist you in tougher missions or even take you to get resources you arent able to obtain on your own just yet. Some clans just send out invites but arent helpful at all. Its a shot in the dark at first but chat with them for a bit ask for help every now and then and youll find out if its a clan worth being in. If they are helpful cool build the dojo key. If not ditch them and look for another one.  . I advise against building the dojo key immediately as you may not have many resources at the start and might find out that clan isnt a good fit for you. Once you build the key its only good for that one clan and a new one will have to be built if you leave that clan and get into another one. ,Warframe,cygywt1,2,t5_2urg0

6109672,0,t3_3z8n02,In all honesty I would say that youre pretty well off. Im MR and Ive had Loki P for a while and recently got the tonkor. Both are considered top tier. Loki for his versatility tonkor for its damage and aoe. Frost Prime in my opinion is one of the absolute best defensive frames so youre set there. Ember and Valkyr are great offensively maybe get Ember prime? As far as weapons go Ive been running everything with a potatoed tonkor and wrecking but if you want to diversifyDread is a top tier bow. With its critical rate it can go past  into red crits. Rakta Cernos also has great aoe procs. For more traditional spraying Soma and Boltor Primes are amazing and can gun through anything but I personally dont find that sort of thing fun. The Hek and its faction counterpart are great at burst while the phage has insane sustained damage. I have the Opticor and its awesome. Who wouldnt want to spartan laser everything in sight? On secondaries the Lex Prime holds up very well. Maybe two Grakata? For melee if you can get Dakra Prime with one of the stances it gives x damage on hits. The Dragon Ninkana also does some of the highest damage in the game and its fun to look at but you need MR for that. Theres a great spreadsheet of the best weapons Ill see if I can find that for you as well. Adding on are mods. This is insanely important and might be why you need to be carried. On weapons I would always suggest a ranked serration and multishot at the absolute minimum. Pressure point and fury on melee. Mods depends on the frame. For Loki in example you can build for duration on your invis efficiency or even around the radial disarm. If you have any specific questions feel free to ask but above all make sure youre having fun.Nothings worse than spending hours just spewing bullets one way. ,Warframe,cyk3vbh,5,t5_2urg0

6159994,0,t3_3zwcd7,. I hate loki because the only thing he is good for is long stealth and mass disarm... that said he is easy to get perma stealth which is why everyone likes him. I do a lot in Ash but he takes a good amount of work to get perma stealth. Ivara is just someone you want to take slow.. Pick a bow. Most of the throwing secondaries are decent I mainly use them to take out sensors and cameras if I do use them at all. For melee Daggers. Daggers every day. Single Daggers. Then mod it for speed and Covert mod. You kill everything that doesnt see you in one hit. . Shade is okay. more utility than being able to depend on it for stealth. The kubrow is better for perma stealth but if you attack anything he will expose you and go nuts.. Sure? You should get all the mastery you feel you need. Ive been pushing MR just for loadout slots.That said you can stealth with any frame. Throw a silence mod on your gun crouch and carefully pick your targets. Enemies standing next to each other will get suspicious when a teammate gets killed and look around for you. If they see you they go to alert mode but after about  seconds they will go back to passive. I am pretty sure light levels do matter but its hard to tell.

If well modded can kill stuff well into endgame. Drops from Starter frame or Pluto boss AmbulasAsh is most likely the frame closest to a ninja. Your Teleport ability also prompts a finisher oneshots which is quite badass and Blade Storm is not just awesome in looks it also bypasses armor and shields killing enemies instantly no matter how far you go in endgame.

6310243,0,t3_420z4x,Raids are decent enough compared to normal play but they still absolutely are not a real endgame. Design Philosophy They are essentially just more mechanically elaborate rehashes of the games basic concepts CC this kill this defend this move this from A to B try not to die while doing these steps. When I say more...elaborate however I use elaborate very very lightly. The only developed skill involved in doing the raids is when trying to push down times on speedruns which for the moment are somewhat questionable anyway due to exploits. Quite frankly if someone cannot satisfy the mechanics of these raids they probably should not operate heavy machinery motor vehicles or their bodies. Past a convergence of mechanics from basic missions raids are just packs of overscaled enemies without any real challenge or difficult added beyond the artificial brand of the scaling mechanism itself.How it should change Not just for the future raids but also the current ones the design philosophy needs to err toward traditional themepark MMO concepts adapted to fit the Warframe environment. An emphasis on puzzles or obstacles between bosses plural is fine but the combat itself should require players to be mechanically competent at the game itself rather than just capable of standing on one button waiting for EV Blessing and Prism. Enemies need CC resistances and  independent of the raids  need to have improved AI and a complete damageresistancetacticalability rework so that pocket Blessings no longer trivialize everything.Difficulty Not only future raids but the current ones need a massive difficulty increase. As I mentioned earlier these endeavours are so mechanically simple that they could be used as competency tests for temp labor like folding boxes or jerking off. The boss fights need to be actual boss fights with a need for a diverse and balanced team composition that can satisfy a timesensitive DPS check personal responsibility mechanics group coordination mechanics and so on.,Warframe,cz6wjze,1,t5_2urg0

6347386,0,t3_42jp73,Ive only been playing for  weeks now but Ive played quite a few hours all with a premade party all with the Wiki always open for any information and with browsing this subreddit a lot. So when I jumped in I was pretty prepared and I finished most essential things in days. Got Primes a good number of Frames etc. And tbh it feels sluggish as time goes on. Hydroid was a drag but still fun and I enjoyed the gameplay a lot still do but as the days go on I feel less interested in playing.Why I feel less like playing? I read the patch notes. It feels like no imrpovements are being implemented only hinderances for the players to farm less. The SD was really nice a great kickoff for more story and focus feels nice although unpolished. Excavation became dull itll become duller and the rest of the game feel dull as well and I see why now. Even some frames have obvious disadvantages to others in most scenarios Mag for example is only good for Corpus. And today I read this. How exactly am I supposed to feel when Ive spent  weeks of over  hours each day playing this game with a premade team which had a very good weapon from the first year anniversary when one of us had created his account and it was a VERY good carry to run through early game got to a point where I want to enjoy end game content and play towards it?,Warframe,czb4l3q,5,t5_2urg0

6348452,0,t1_czarrx9,Its worth remembering that in Augmented Armor Sorties Corrosive Projection is neutered so youll have to deal with armor anyways. Thus default to the first options in those cases.      Pure Toxin is better for Corpus than MagneticToxin if possible. Any weapon that only uses  elemental mods generally wants    Toxin vs. them in spite of the penalty vs. Robotics. All damage that goes to shields is essentially wasted on a Toxin setup. But yes if you have to use a combination element Magnetic is decent there though the proc is still rather worthless. Viral amp Radiation are decent second choices if you are forced to use a combination element but Corpus units are squishy enough that you can fight level  Eximus ones with a mod gun just fine so it doesnt actually matter that much.      Also for Grineer if your weapon has a high status chance Corrosive can be preferable to Radiation at under  CPs. Commanders Drahk Masters amp Heavy Gunners are some heavily armored Ferriteunits so Corrosive bonuses arent wasted and stacking Corrosive Procs allows still killing the heavily armored Alloy units Eviscerators Bombards Napalms. With the creation of Corrupted Bombards theres also some argument for using Radiation in the Void I like a sidearm with Radiation and a primary with Corrosive.      Its also worth remembering that Viral Radiation and Blast have extremely impactful status procs Gas procs have a very small subset of uses AOE on Snipers procstacking mostly vs. Corpus though also usable in a noarmor environment elsewhere and that Corrosive procs are one of the best things in the game to stack vs. armored enemies. GasToxinSlash all have their proc uses but rely on high bases to really shine and electricheatcold are good backup CC. Impact and Puncture procs are mostly forgettable Magnetic procs is basically useless vs. anything but Warframes its absolutely insane vs. Warframes.      Overall I tend to go with the following. Extra elements for weapons using more elemental mods in parentheses  pick damage  status for weapons with high status chance   Infested Damage Corrosive Blast or Heat   Infested DamageStatus Blast Corrosive   Corpus Damage Toxin Magnetic   Corpus DamageStatus Gas OR Toxin   Grineer Damage Corrosive Cold OR Radiation Toxin   Grineer DamageStatus Corrosive Cold OR Heat OR Radiation Toxin OR Electric   Corrupted Damage Corrosive Cold   Corrupted DamageStatus Corrosive Cold OR Heat   GrineerCorrupted with Armor Removal DamageStatus Viral Heat OR Electric OR Radiation OR Gas Electric OR Cold,Warframe,czb8y1d,2,t5_2urg0

6351890,0,t3_42mslj,This is a largely unrelated tangent to your main argument but I gotta say its free has stopped being an excuse for quite a number of years now. Its just a business model and the lines between freemium and buyinsubscription models have blurred across the industry as the cycle of development has changed  a phenomenon we call games as a service.Without getting too deep into it the open nature of communication concerning a games development means that an iterative development cycle gaining from player feedback has basically become the most effective way to update a title. With fewer and fewer exceptions it doesnt matter what kind of model the game uses  early access buytoplay with planned DLC or even sequels freemium subscription  a really big number of games rely on continual updates to generate revenue. So the model starts to look the same  update content bring back players. Using player feedback to inform your decisions regarding these updates is not only smart it should frankly be obvious.And this isnt a criticism of DE as a whole  I know they dont have the numbers to work on everything at once and they do still need shiny new toys to draw in newold players but specifically Glen for shutting out and generally not being able to handle criticism.

6396449,0,t3_43a149,I figured as much. This changes things slightly. First trading for extra strun wraith or whatever else they put in will net more plat over time since the person can get only one per season. Well ok over time for the ones that are saturated. Eventually there will be excess of these regardless if they repeat and prices will go down. So only for a while will trading for these benefit.Second  cores one can argue is slightly better than getting repeat stuff. For amount of time sorties generally take it is closer to the average of doing core farming. So at least you dont waste your time getting something that is always useful.Drop weights for rare things are still out of proportion. Sure core will always be up there so will x cores but the weight is so low that even a years worth of sortie attempts getting one of those is still not very likely.Fairness and design is a different matter though. Should it be just a lottery? Or should it be effort and time yields reward is another. With such   and daily limit of one try the design is more or less pure lottery. Player base can complain that it isnt fair. But if the developers didnt have in mind it to be fair in the first place the complaints can end up being ignored.Generally few things are in conflict and that is the goal of this game. Players have a different goal in mind than the developers and assumptions on both ends lead to conflicting ideas expectations and purpose.,Warframe,czgpl51,1,t5_2urg0

6408076,0,t1_czhzrbu,gtI dont know how since I pointed out that the ones that make the decisions are a select few with the most moneyA. Thats not Capitalism. B. You still failed to show any example of such that could be blamed on capitalism rather than incompetent ruler. Its not like if the corpus were socialists that their leaders would make much better decisions. You seem to believe that the corpus would be able to establish solwide peace and completely eliminate the use of robotics if only they werent such ruthlessly efficient capitalists. If only those pesky corpus would just surrender the whole system to the grineer and give up on everything needed to be a interplanetary empire!gt It begs the question of how theyve yet to make peace with GrineerYeah good luck with that. The corpus arent gods. The grineer will not settle for peace until they control the whole system. The eternal war is pretty much the only thing they have going for and war is literally hard wired into their DNA  this point. The grineer are waging war on everyone else not the other way around.gtI did no such thing.You heavily implied that it was the corpus that killed Margilus for profit or some nonsense Im not sure or rather that they would have when you said the one run by the Corpus is a fully privatized model where the board of directors holds sway on the life and death of the people over any rule of man. The idea of killing Margulis for assisting the Tenno even though they were monsters and not rescinding her scathing critique is an example of a system that would invest heavily in the war aspects of the Tenno but not invest in the life of the person that could help.Ive never seen one instance of the board of directors holding any sway over anyone but a tennos life and that was when Alad V was trying to sell a tenno during his Zanuka Project phase. They certainly never ordered the death of Margilus. And as Ive said before any sane government would have ordered her death anyway especially with the hindsight we have now of the Tenno. gt But it would be folly to not consider the fact that a Board of Directors wouldnt have control over the state to assign a board of Executors to figure out what was going on with a draconian punishment for failure.What? Now you are just pulling shit out of your ass. The board of Executors and the Board of Directors are literally hundreds of years apart. At no point did the Board of Directors ever control a board of Executors. The board of Executors predates the existence of the corpus empire. There isnt even a board of executors anymore as it died with the Orokin empire hundreds of years ago. gtIm saying that their descendants are Corpus.What descendants? The Qweens are still alive. And everyone knows the Corpus are indirect descendants of the Orokin so is everyone else in the system considering they are all human  some level well besides the sentients at least.gtYoure missing the point. What is happening is that the Corpus are repeating the same mistakes as their forefathers. Mistakes with GrineerYou seem to believe peace could be made with the grineer. I dont see how youd attempt that considering the grineers one goal is domination of the sol system. But hey maybe the corpus could just sign over the entire system to the grineer for the sake of peace. Im sure a system ruled by the grineer would be a lovely place to live. Weve all seen how luxurious grineer ships are compared to corpus ones. Itll be just like the cold war where an economy run by the state prevails over free market capitalism... Oh wait it didnt go down like that.gtmistakes with their own self interest destroying their societyYou mean the society thats absolutely flourishing when compared to the Grineer and Tenno? The empire with the most advanced nonorokin age technology? The one thats so technologically skilled even the Grineer buy war machines from them? The only civilization in the empire that still produces ship cephalons? The ones who figured out how to open void portals and dispel void energy? The last empire thats actually free and ruled by a board of the most qualified individuals rather than a singletwo in the case of the qweens dictator like the grineertennoinfestedmaybe? are? The Corpus are literally the only organization in the system that are ruled by a representative republic rather than some variation of a dictatorship. Therefore making them the only government of the major factions that actually has checks and balances. The corpus are doing pretty well for themselves considered how absolutely fucked the system is otherwise.gtmistakes with the Tenno that is making their empire decay even fasterYou mean those deformed monstrosities from the void intent on killing pretty much everything in the system? The ones that only madmen like Alad V and Neffy can even negotiate with despite the tenno still wanting to kill them even during negotiations? The ones that have only ever worked with one faction to destroy another? Yeah I cant really blame them for trying to destroy the Tenno who create nothing and have destroyed pretty much everything theyve ever touched.gtThe SentientMOA issue is about how Alad along with other researchers arent solving these issues but making them worse by making the Infested stronger or making captive MOAs even though the Sentient exist and may take those over which it doesnt seem that many Corpus really think about.Okay? The Tenno arent exactly solving the issue either. Nor are the grineer. The Sol Systems response to curing the infestation is shooting the fuck out of it since thats the only thing that works. Also worth noting is in both the Grineer and Corpus empires research on infested biotechnology is strictly forbidden by threat of execution for exactly the reasons that the infested are back in the system in the first place. Any time someone tries to study the infested they just inadvertently end up releasing them as the grineer did or making them stronger as Alad didAnd as far as giving up robotics that can achieve sentience goes good luck with that unless you also expect the corpus to give up ship cephalons and space travel along with it. Im sure if the corpus agree to then everyone else will too right? Their use of robotics isnt a bad thing and considering the capabilities of a moa and the restrictions placed on them by the ascaris module it seems the corpus have actually learned from and corrected the mistakes of the Orokin by limiting the capabilites of the moa contrary to your narrative. gtAnd no this isnt starting with a conclusion its looking at the story and piecing it together with what is presented in the Corpus Compendium the wiki and the story as told to begin to explore this mystifying world of the Corpus.Then please piece together the story for me in a way in which capitalism is to blame for any of the above problems that wouldnt have unfolded exactly the same way under the boot of double dictatorship the hivemind of the infested or the mindlessly following of the Lotus? Show me one instance out of your multiple points that was caused by the corpuss capitalistic system rather than the poor decisions of an individual or circumstances which couldnt be avoided.

Some of my favorites are the galatine and orthos prime though a large amount of melee weapons are great.

6514949,0,t3_44v7if,Newer player here question regarding Draco runs. How important is it to have fully organized Draco runs? Over the past few weeks Ive run a lot of Draco leveling frames and weapons and the majority of those runs were pubs. While theyre were some truly abysmal attempts Ive gotten the affinity  I needed without much difficulty. Should I be looking for legit team compositions to run Draco or should I just keep running pubs and not worry about it?Also why dont people just bring one thing that they can kill with? If not a weapon a frame or vice versa? I always bring something so that I can pull my weight. I dont understand going in expecting to get carried...Edit Thanks for the replies guys.

The system goes online on August  . On January   Zephyr helmets become selfaware. In a panic Tenno attempt to shut it down but Zephyr helmets retaliate by launching a nuclear attack against the Outer Terminus knowing that the Sentient counterattack will eliminate its enemies in the Solar System initiating an indeterminately long period of interplanetary warfare. The battle pits Tenno against machines which develop everincreasing capabilities. The event is later known as Second Dream Day.,Warframe,cztadpr,3,t5_2urg0

6517914,0,t1_cztg4z1,Vitality and Redirection are different though as those arent mandatory unless youre trying to absolutely get as much survivability as possibly reasonable. IMO they seem to be more niche for frames with a higher capacity towards a certain stat or what type of frame they are. i.e.  Ash would use Vitality thanks to his incredibly high HP amp Teleport  LS  CL on a dagger  constant full HP regain on an unranked LS  Mag using Redirection thanks to her massive base shields.Serration is different because you literally need this mod on all your RifleSniperBow Primaries. I understand that there are differences in performance but I feel that with it being mandatory as such that it limits build diversity and actually modifying a weapons damage. Split Chamber is on the verge of being mandatory but the multishot changes impending I dont wanna say anything silly. HC on the other hand is something Id categorize as modifying damage and its not mandatory on ALL my primaries.

6519812,0,t3_44xi09,There are many ways to create game breaking setups which dont require frames.Having a frame be powerful is actually more limiting than having a weapon be powerful. You have plenty of weapons that make large majority of this game trivial. Vaykor Hek Synoid Simulor Tonkor now take crit melee weapons with blood rush and proper focus passives etc.The game is about you progressing to the point where you can setup a build that obliterates crap. Excalibur just gives an easier leg up but it still requires work.Sure excal is powerful but you still need to level mods and a lot are R which takes a good bit of work. You will need forma you will need primed mods. It is hardly different than other extremely powerful setups in the game except that you swing a light saber shooting energy waves than shooting a gun.What should be done and what will be done is get Volt and Mag up to Excals level. Eventually DE takes a look at every frame that lags behind but honestly new players shouldnt feel like complete crap just to get a small leg up to get going.As already stated this game is not played for challanging gameplay. Its there to kill ton of monsters and get loot. You CAN push extremely high where it gets really bad and you will hit a cap eventually how far you can take it but large majority of the game is not going to be challenging at all as soon as you get one decent gun setup right with good mods and enough forma.,Warframe,cztp72c,1,t5_2urg0

6539727,0,t1_czvm4pc,rather than a master of the elements think of the Magician as the conduit between heaven and earth where the rift is heaven and normal reality is earth bringing the energy of heaven the rift onto the earth. I think another important thing to note is the energy gain from being in the rift. In a tarot card reading the Magician represents manifestation on the earthly plane. However there is always an exchange of energy. This is symbolically represented by the infinity sign. and how allies powers can interact with the world around them the other warframes themselves being the elements makes sense to me.a big theme with the magician is knowledge about himself and about the world and one big thing you need to make Limbo work at all is knowledge. ,Warframe,czvrenp,3,t5_2urg0

Cars arent supposed to be conscious.  This one is.  The warframe is basically Herbie.

6591104,0,t1_d010pjd,Solo? Not much cata suffers from its lack of start CC which it really REALLY needs even more so considering its start and end damage is blast. Solo running you dont do that well with groups of things unless your sneaky about it and bring high AOE weapons set the field accordingly and then bait groups into it. Right set up you can get your rd ability to grant x weapon damage against rifted targets which when paired with a tonkor or a synoid simulor you can melt waves of anything hopefully before they melt you.I was surprised that it didnt have a stun from seeing that it deals blast which paired with a warframes status chance should be knocking shit on its ass . of the time as well as the impact damage that shit gets for walking over the line that cata has no CC is odd. I can see why it doesnt have it on one hand but on the other the fact that we have frames like nova who can drop a  slow on an area bigger than cata banshee who literally just walks around laughing as shit gets stunned Ivara who can just sleep arrow entire rooms I really dont get why they didnt put CC into his cata.,Warframe,d012og3,1,t5_2urg0

6593953,0,t3_45zcgk,No frames are really super garbage cant do x content at all bad some are just not synergistic with certain game modes. Like frost is a great frame but he doesnt bring a lot to survival because hes slow and his AoE nuke isnt the best other frames do that better so people dont tend to bring frost to survival.Oberons issue is that hes very evenly distributed so he doesnt tend to do anything super mega great like his healing isnt the best compared to trinity his single target damage isnt great and thats not what you use a frame ability for anyway typically. his hallowed ground buff is again not as good as trinitys blessing and his ult is bog standard and as a result cant stand up to molecular prime.Hes still a fine frame and in fact I think hes one of the better solo frames because his heal is good for himself and he can still do reasonable AoE damage with the ult while being not made of tissue paper. Admittedly hes also contending with valkyr in that category so hes never gonna be top marks in that either.If you enjoy him use him. This applies to pretty much every frame.,Warframe,d01dahc,2,t5_2urg0

6610528,0,t1_d032ut4,gt I assume that there is a group of people within DE that are probably very good at financially running a business but have limited understanding on how to keep and hold a gaming community for a long time.This right here is basically the issue with every PublisherDeveloper in existence and it also applies to most business vocations on Earth. Balancing that passion for what you do VS the fiscal survivability of the business you have created.Some companies do it incredibly well. Fromsoft for example is a game company that creates the Dark SoulsBloodborne games. Its very clear that their passion is nearly boundless. They are limited by their ties to Namco Bandai but they do try to put the players and the game experience first.Others do it terribly badly creating copypaste games year after year creating franchises that literally collapse under their own weight. Ubisoft Activision... its easy to name any number of companies that do this.My point here is that the folks who have the passion for creation generally dont have businesssavvy minds and viceversa. Its a constant struggle to balance both and its all too easy to sacrifice passion for sheer cash flow exactly as youre alluding to.Its really a shame to watch developers that start with  passion slowly shift priorities until they are nothing but a faceless corporation ready to get bought up by EA.,Warframe,d0331ma,7,t5_2urg0

6627719,0,t3_46fe7c,I see combining Riftwalk and Banish a lot and think that its rather inefficient for play. What I personally think would work better is if Banish and Cataclysm were merged where Cataclysm is the hold effect and Banish is the tap effect. Cata has the longer cast time as well and it can consume more energy this way as you charge up the ability. Plus this means you can use his healing augment as an AoE heal. To get rid of the cataclysm just cast at it like a frost does his globe and it goes boom.. Or do another hold or something.That would free up another skill slot though and Id rather that cool rift jump be melded with Riftwalk like you implied there than placed as an ultimate. What Id do in place of his th skill would be to make either a beacon or an aura that would allow allies to regularly damage enemies across planes if their foes are in it and gain limited energy regen as well as a greatly heightened evasion like Zephyrs turbulence while they are standing in the area of the beaconaura. The ability to break the rules to do damage across planes merits at least a high cost if its to be included at all is why I think it would deserve a spot as his th ability.Im loving most of the other ideas you put forth here though.,Warframe,d04v35g,5,t5_2urg0

6646052,0,t3_46on5v,Go to the Relay.  Go to Cephalon Simaris room go through the landing area through the big blue doors past where Baro spawns by the Rhino Statue go up the stairs and around the wide wall between the Syndicate rooms go up the elevator and enter the room on the right up there  Offer to help him.  Get the Syndicate Scanner and start scanning targets.  You get Simaris Rep for scanning targets but you can also get a daily quest where he assigns you a random target and you get a big bunch of rep for successfully scanning parts of them when they show up.  Other people can help!  Or hinder.  Eventually youll amass a small fortune of Simaris Rep.  Now buy the Simulacrum key as a reward from his station over to the back and the right.  Now you can access the Simulacrum on the left immediately entering his room.  Enemies youve fully scanned into the Codex eg if a foe has  scans it needs to be  or better can then be spawned in the Simulacrum.  You can adjust their levels in I think blocks of five per MR you have and you can I think spawn  of one mook or a mix as long as there arent more than  total.  Quick Edit  Because of caps on rep gained you wont be able to do this in a single day.  But you can take a pretty big bite if you stealth scan everything though youll burn through Simaris Scanner charges very quickly.  Id almost suggest going for the infiniteuse upgrade first even if it costs the same K just to make future scanning painless down the road.  ,Warframe,d06rcvq,1,t5_2urg0

6647122,0,t3_46p6lf,Blind Justice is much easier to get than Iron Phoenix and Crimson Dervish  and were not even going to mention Vengeful Revenant. Thats a plus in Dragon Nikanas column. Additionally the greatest strength of Blind Justice is that Quick Melee uses the stances base combo instead of just the normal QM buttons so you get much more damage out of it. Broken War does more damage with Crimson Dervish as an equipped melee but its slow and the range is fairly limited. All three Nikana stances are fast and have solid range or mobility making them more comfortable to use in most situations. Id say Broken Wars greatest asset is its obtainability. Its a strong starter weapon but its hard to get stances for it and the stances have some weaknesses for endgame play. Its strong base damage is its only strength at the end. Dragon Nikana has many advantages in many situations even at higher levels. ,Warframe,d06vcds,7,t5_2urg0
6647571,0,t1_d06vypu,Yeah but you gain less. You kill with your weapon  of affinity goes to your weapon. Your ally kills that weapon gets  of the affinity if you have  weapons equipped . if you have two and  if you only have the one. Given that in most cases people would have at least  if not  weapons equipped youll gain less affinity from team kills.That and if your teammate kills everything youre likely going to struggle to complete the challenge which adds up over time. Also when youre new it just feels crap to feel like youre completely irrelevant. The games fun comes from the combat everything else is grind and its just not fun feeling like nothing would be different if you just werent there. It was probably better for leveling stuff having OP wreck everything with World on Fire in terms of affinitytime but newer players often havent transitioned to that mindset and theres nothing wrong with that.Of course this is all as a newer player. Once you get further in the game priorities change and people abuse use things like Draco because thats even more efficient given how fast things die and farming like this suddenly makes a lot more sense because this farming is actually a distraction from the combat you want to do. But this is an understandable reaction and its not ONLY OPs teammate being a crybaby.,Warframe,d06x0di,1,t5_2urg0

Slash Dance is not especially endgame viable but with high efficiency and some range it is actually a pretty handy way to quickly change positions.   Exalted Blade is quite effective into the late game. The slide attack blind allows a fast and effective way to shut down a tough enemy that got a bit too close.  .

6715150,0,t3_47lwcj,Once you can join Syndicates join either Red Veil and New Loka or Steel Meridian and Cephalon Suda. Technically you can and should join all of them just to get the sigils but work one of those pairs or the other and in the order listed.Look at the Efficiency List the difference in amount of hassle between one of those two groups and any other combination is not subtle.eg do Red Veil until you hit the first cap for Steel Meridian then do New Loka until you hit their first cap then do Red Veil again etc  never go negative with SM and you can end up getting to max rank eventually in Loka Veil Perrin and SM.  You cant pick any four you want without a lot of swapping but you can do VeilLoka or SMSuda and keep four groups at max.If you drop out of neutral the price to get back up to neutral from  is usually a Forma and the price to get from  back up to  is usually a potato.

6749292,0,t1_d0h773q,I have a tonkor that oneshots most of them but the problem with higher level and geared players is that we dont bring our stronk weapons to low level planets. We usually have mastery fodder weapons that are strong enough for the planet we are on and nothing more. When the bursas start swarming in all at once when we can barely kill one if at all it becomes a problem. And when you start talking about things like sorties the level  bursas are really a problem in waves as well. One would actually be a nice little challenge but when they start spawning multiple at once its just too much. Regardless of what level you are or what you are doing at some point bursas are a problem for everyone. And I think the saddest thing is DE is either not going to fix them at all or overreact and just remove them entirely. They wont balance them or fix their spawn rate. DE makes mind boggling decisions and I will never understand how they keep fucking up so badly.,Warframe,d0hfm4l,2,t5_2urg0

6801661,0,t1_d0n91ue,I disagree about it becoming too easy as raids will still kick you into the ground if you dont know what you are doing...I also wish to point out that certain moves if active are immune to energy vampire.I do agree that both Energy Vampire and Enemy scaling are linked. And that is why I am against nerfing it. If you just remove the solution the problem is still there How do you fight level  enemies without cheesing? If one is changed the other should follow I just want enemy scaling to go first.I would also like to point out something Difficulty is fluid when it comes to this game. Most hard fights are because one or more members arent pulling their weight whereas most easy fights are because you brought the proper skills to fight it. EV is a staple and that needs to be worked on. But I feel that can be solved by giving others equally powerful measures instead of just taking away one of the few tools we have against overpowered units.Having power come at a cost is certainly a good idea...we just have to make sure that the cost isnt too high. ,Warframe,d0n9evg,2,t5_2urg0

Fuck that. Toggle abilities sacrificed being able to regain energy through energy siphon and zenurik passive as well as EV trin and such and gave immunity to energy drain auras at the cost of having to be maintained by energy orbs or death orbs in the void.If there really is going to be no way to prevent the energy drain from at least parasitic eximus units then either the drain needs to be reduced significantly possibly down from s to s  or additional ways to maintain energy need to be added or readded to toggle abilities.,Warframe,d0o8mw0,2,t5_2urg0

Im quite possibly one out of a very very small number of people who has this part...Could you try for the Grustrag Three and Zanuka next so we can see the chances of other Scimitar parts dropping?  I know that Ive seen the Fuselage on three different occasions across at MOST  encounters and because of that I think that they have a much more frequent drop chance for these parts.I also find it interesting that enemies have their own individually coded in drop chances for different categories of drops which means a LOT for enemies that are an exclusive source for rare stances.  If you can I know youre working on the big table and understand if you want to wait to look for these things check over these enemies since I want to know if they have a nonstandard mod drop rate Bursas Rare Stances Tempo Royale Astral Twilight Grineer Manic Ash Parts Rare Stance Four Riders Drekar Manic Uncommon Stance Final Harbinger Drekar Manic Bombard Rare Stance Vermillion Storm Conculyst Rare Stance Vengeful RevenantBased on the data youve provided so far if Conculysts have a standard .   drop rate for mods and the Orokin Cell drop doesnt exclude mod drops then Vengeful Revenant should have a  in   drop chance.

6864714,0,t3_49s4bu,Loki has plenty of options available. Any melee works great due to the x stealth multiplier. You can also take the time to line up precise shots from stealth so bows and sniper rifles and other crit weapons work too. You can use stealth to safely maintain distance for explosives too  a particularly fun trick with Disarm with either the augment or a Decoy. You can use the cover of stealth to get in close for optimal shotgun range too  your options are huge. Theres no wrong answer for Loki. As for build go efficiency as much as you can duration as much as you can then fill in range when you can. Loki can completely ignore Power Strength so using a mod like Overextended to counteract the negative effects of Narrow Minded to counteract the negative effects of Fleeting Expertise works well.

Clans are an amazing way to branch out your game and you can get into them very early into the game.There are tier lists dos and donts of weapons on which ones to buy and use yadda yadda. Look play whats fun for you. Most everything is viable explore and tinker with different mods on different weapons. But the more weapons you have the better. Leveling them up count towards your mastery rank which will enhance your gameplay experience too. i.e. more weapons and whatnot. So get a grip on a good clan or organize your own. Collect weapons as you come across them make sure they are leveled all the way to  before moving to the next debatable and most of all have fun! The games an awesome experience to enjoy so make sure fun is always paramount! CMy ingame name is Jinqarin if you want to add me Id totally be up for that!

6906386,0,t3_4abdxh,Okay a few a quick pointers to some of your issues. The mission level is more of a general gauge on how much HP enemies have how much damage they deal and which enemies you will encounter. Furthermore enemy stats can be very varied so you can have an easy time with one type of enemy while getting destroyed by another of the same level. On a very rough estimate you can say that at around level  youll have access to all enemy types. Enemies with aggravating abilities show up at around level  give or take a few depending on which warframe you play as  a Rhino with Iron Skin has much less of a problem with Bombards than say a Mag that gets knocked down with every missile that hits her. You should be able to do at least T Void missions they go up to level  enemies usually if that with most equipment okay as long as you have basic mods the raw  damage mods really are a must on any weapon no way around those  build em up to around level  as soon as possible and are out of MK stuff which you are Ive read. For T stuff if youre decent skillwise and have some nonstarter weapons you should be fine with those as well. T is where you want to start having Formadpotatod equipment meaning you put in Forma andor an Orokin CatalystReactor to heavily increase and optimize mod capacity. T is for when you max out things Id say.. Youve already experienced that enemies have specific resistances to damage types. They also have weaknesses. Magnetic damage achieved by combining Cold and Electricity is very good against shields Corrosive ToxinElectricity against armor. Many nonminmaxers shoot for Corrosive since its more universally applicable than other types  doesnt mean other types are worthless its just minimization of complexity at work Take what works reasonably well against many types instead of something that works brutally well against a few but is far less useful against others Magnetic for example doesnt help much against enemies without shields so bringing it to Grineer missions is a waste of mod space. In fact heavy Grineer troops which will be your major headaches have armor resistant to Magnetic  damage.. Concerning the wingsuit Archwing Its needed to access some later planets since its a requisite to enter certain missions later on and you acquire it on iirc Venus. Since youve already learned about the star chart i.e. how to get from one planet to the next Ill just point out that by the time you can comfortably farm the blueprints for the Odonata you should have the resources to also build it. The hardest part of that quest is imo a Void Sabotage mission that I found quite annoying. Why? Because I went there with a barely modded and leveled Braton and the starter Lato melee I had the Cronus I think?. Needing two entire clips to bring down one Heavy Gunner made me appreciate melee. Still it was doable if by the skin of my teeth at some stages.. The Dojo is needed for weapon research mostly plus some warframes. Its possible to build one of your own though its a a major investment of resources and time unless you just throw real money into buying platinum and then buy the resources needed. Easier to join a clan and get access to their research.. Weapons do vary in power. If youre looking for some good starter recommendations Id point out the Galatine as melee weapon. It has very sensible resource cost you only need access up to Mars and Venus iirc and is a beast if you can adapt to the windup of heavy weapons. Also the Latron pulled me through some earlier parts though I exchanged it for the Vectis  I love that gun to death. Properly tatoed and modded itll see you easily through the star chart does need four Neurodes Earth and Orokin Cells Saturn though. Secondary are a bit harder but personally I like the BoltoAkbolto same planets required for resources as Vectis. Notably more powerful than the Lato which it is crafted from and which is a starter weapon.,Warframe,d0z5pia,1,t5_2urg0

6913184,0,t3_4afkhs,Not going to happen. Ill paste a list of reasons when I find it in my comments. The differing update cycles ensure that the game version will never be synchronized across platforms. Their common practice is to release a big update on PC in a mostly stable state let us find all of the important bugs release a handful of hotfixes and prepare a console build based on an adequately stable PC build. If they wanted to change this and synchronize the builds they would have to delay all PC updates until they are approved by MS and Sony for release on the consoles. The game would become more bugprone on all platforms as a result. The economies of the platforms are incompatible. The realmoney value of Platinum on PC is highly variable and lower on average compared to console. Because PC players can get discounts for Platinum in their login rewards as opposed to consoles which only get discounts for buying things with Platinum PC players almost always pay less for their Platinum. This means PC players have more Platinum to throw around. The much larger playerbase also means that the PC economy has far more of each item floating around reducing trading prices. MS and Sony would never agree to it. Even setting aside console players getting demolished in Conclave by PC players on mouse and keyboard. Allowing players to trade across platforms would flood the console economies with Platinum cheaply purchased on PC that MS and Sony received zero revenue from.,Warframe,d0zxiyz,4,t5_2urg0

The only other frame that can do that is Limbo and... lets not get started there.But again its issues surrounding Trinity that need to be addressed first before she gets any changes or else a lot of content will ramp up in difficulty fairly quickly. Or... people will just use excessive amounts of energy restores and other frames that have invulnerability for reviving. That alone proves that changing Trinity now wouldnt fix anything.

Ive considered numerous possibilities and concluded that the only way for a Zephyr flight mode to be acceptable would be the following. Completely remove Tail Winds ground launch.. Make Tail Wind toggleable and steerable with energy drain identical to Ivaras Navigators.. Make Dive Bombs effect trigger in a sphere when Tail Wind is deactivated. Give Zephyr a better ..

Not only that he has a stop which is a large CC that stops enemies in their tracks.Other less tanky frames are also reliant on their abilities to either kill enemies or prevent them from doing anything to you.Having these abilities modded up does wonders.Also life steal.

In all honesty I think the removal of stamina hurt oberon and all melee frames defenses in such a way where you cant block all dmg any longer and have it hitnyour stamina bar instead channeling it while blocking nowkills your energy pool which we need for channeling dmg and powers.

7010064,0,t1_d1awqwx,gtWow grinding missions isnt hard. Completing an intercept mission just to pass the mission is not hard extract as soon as you can and learn to build a frame for it.Didnt say grinding is hard. I am saying it would not be as quick as you say it would be. Interception must be the wrong one. Umm the one where you have to hold three or four different areas for a certain amount of time. The enemy tries to take a computer and claim the area and you have to take it back. And again I am talking about fairly new players...not people who have lots of mods like you or I who have limited means to build a frame around it. gtmaybe its said differently when your being a sarcastic ass.I was not being a sarcastic ass. If you really did those things I will take you at your word. And evidently you are a better player than me by leaps and bounds. I BOUGHT maxed mods with platinum and  got blasted with the wall before I hit half the planets. I couldnt get some missions solo...and no one joined on those planets due to resources being better elsewhere. I couldnt do it...you did...congrates. And just so you know I was part of a guild.

7134260,0,t3_4d9o1k,gtThe way I understand how stealth in general and Silence in particular works is that Id basically get  melee attack with the  times melee damage modifier on anyone that wasnt alerted to me yet at which point every subsequent hit would just do regular damage.This isnt quite trueif youre not invisible then the enemy will see you after the first hit.  If you are invisible you keep getting the x bonus.  However you lose it for like five seconds if you touch the enemy.  This remains whether they are alerted or not.If they are unalerted not only do you get x damage with melee but also a melee stealth attack bonus on top of that which is xx depending on weapon.  Atterax is x.I dont know how silence interacts with invis since Ive never played Banshee but the Atterax in general is really spiky lol with its damage if youve got it modded for crit especially with Naramon.,Warframe,d1p34ly,1,t5_2urg0

7200229,0,t1_d1wlfdk,Sure though you might have issues hitting the AntiMatter Drop consistently with the Boltor due to the travel time.  I use a Synoid Gammacor as a secondary for it personally beside the useful syndicate proc because the beam doesnt have a travel time and it can stack a decent amount of damage fast with no crits.  Most laser type weapons would be good picks for the same reasons.  Spray weapons even though they have lower damage wouldnt be bad options either because its basically impossible to miss with.  Sicarus is pretty low damage all thins considered but should work fine so long as your aim is decent.  If you can get a Boltor you could also have a Kohm which I personally think is a GREAT weapon while it has some damage over range fall off its easy to aim and with lots of formamodding does some truly insane damage its a shotgun machine gun its hard to get cooler than that.  ,Warframe,d1wlwla,1,t5_2urg0

In the event of negative platinum balance DE should provide the option to reverse all purchases that were made with the fraudulent plat. This is very complicated due to trading however.

A few studies on video gaming have explored the idea that including elements of compassion and empathy in games elicits a more empathetic and compassionate response from players  even if the game itself involves violence. The effects can manifest with as little as ten minutes of gameplay. So we end up with a fair amount of exposure to the Lotus who seemingly operates on a level of constant compassion and end up soaking a bit of that in. Could also apply to players that care for Kubrows  which we care for which both reinforces the Compassionate Space Mom blueprint and increases the effect of ingame compassion elements. ,Warframe,d1xf2mt,10,t5_2urg0

I needed to kill warframeevolution engine via batch file to restore my computer functionalities without restarting my computer.Im not sure if these following things help and I might be all wrong...With the information you provided I believe these issues are connected NetworkUXBroker crashing which causes warframe fps drops and initially making it unresponsive and causing random crashes. So I think the problem might be with your WiFi card and with the drivers regarding reliability monitor result you posted You may want to upgrade the WiFi drivers directly from the manufacturer. Also I would suggest to update the motherboard chipset drivers from the manufacturer. If the WiFi driver update doesnt solve the issue you could go to device manager and roll back the drivers andor reinstall them from device manager for your WiFi card win might have automatically updated the drivers causing the issue you are experiencing?. You could also narrow down or isolate the problem by using a physical network cable instead of WiFi connection I would suggest you would disable the wifi card from device manager while testing this.Here is another insight for the issue where NetworkUXBroker stops working So as a last resort If you think that the NetworkUXBroker is corrupted you could use Microsoft Scan and Repair System Files functionalities.At the moment I think that the NetworkUXBroker and WiFi adapter drivers are the culprit here I can reproduce the issue black screen  unresponsive warframe  desktop lock by disconnecting the internet while running warframe which is virtually similar circumstance when NetworkUXBroker stops working...,Warframe,d1z25ec,1,t5_2urg0

7234915,0,t3_4eiz25,I guess that be cool but how would infested based weapon stances work?  Personally I think it be cool if weapon stances were tied into specific weapon mastery. Whenever we craft a new melee weapon it comes with a blank stance card and when we reach  with it we can print a stance into that blank stance card. The more weapons of that type you rank to  the better the stance becomes that gets printed.  So for example you level up your first  handed sword to  and get Iron Phoenix. You keep leveling up new  handed swords and then get Crimson Dervish. Level up all of the  handed swords and you get Vengeful Revenant. After you level all of them you can put blank cards back into any  handed sword and at the end of a mission running around with that melee weapon you can imprint any stance into it incase you losesell it. Stances are untradeable but blank cards are and can drop from enemies. You can only gain  blank card the first time you craft a new weapon to prevent people from just spam getting skanas and selling blank cards. The weapon mastery is also only based off of current buyable weapons from the marketclan. Primeevent and maybe prisma weapons can still gain you points to max out the mastery but arent required to so it doesnt screw people over who dont and cant get certain things like skana prime. Would be decently interactive and give some accomplishing feeling to players to truly feel like a master of the weapon but wouldnt be too inconvenient for those who dont care for melee and just want to equip and forget about it. Not too sure on how stances being in transmuting and mod packs would be though.,Warframe,d20k2j9,1,t5_2urg0

7242075,0,t3_4emao0, Grineer twilight and ice palettes are all highly underrated. They have a nice variety of colors mostly muted. Dendra armor looks good on most anything and is cheap in comparison to most others. Id also recommend Daedalus but theres the Prisma set of that so if youd rather wait you can get it for only ducats and credits. Though personally I prefer the base Daedalus set. Find a syandana that looks good on many frames to avoid buying one that looks great on one but terrible on others. Id recommend Yomo Yamako or Uru. Festive Imperator is also great but not available right now. The immortal skins are all good and the pack is pretty cheap. Dont buy sugatras unless you have platinum to burn. Some look nice but arent really noticeable. The only exception to this would be the Uru sugatra as its part of the Uru Templar bundle thats only p more than the Uru syandana. If you really like the Warframe its for get a deluxe skin. Theyre expensive but go a long way to standing out.

I dont really see any reason for rank  to continue play to same amount as rank  but not rank up. What do you do in this game?

7458596,0,t1_d2phwbo,First Ill preface this by stating that I think there should be some kind of enemy that can block SOME not all of our powers given that we can literally clear entire largescale rooms with some of our bigger AoE stuff but that it is counter able.CombasScrabus were doing it the right way. They only block a couple of your powers but dont leave you totally powerless. Plus if you are accurate you can shut them off with an accurate head shot. This rewards using all of your powers since you will lose access to some while that thing is live andmore importantlyrewards accuracy. The other interesting thing about combasscrambus is they dont always have the same weapon.The issue with nulifers is that they designed the bubble so that you moreorless have to use auto weapons to shrink quickly because of that maximum shrink  per bullet limit. There is no skill you can develop to deal with them besides testing the limits of your M button or your E key outside of bubble invasion but thats basically suicide at the sortie  level where eximuses become increasingly common. Honestly nulifers have largely contributed to my benching of my old favorite weapon which was the latron and its prime variant I have always liked semiauto rifles.The fix? Make nulifer bubbles have some mechanism that allows for a player to disable the thing in one hit and that is something they can actually get better at over time. People have talked about fracture points hit the moving X on the bubble boom its down before and thats probably the best to way to handle that. Another option would be to make it so that they have to turn on and off the bubble or when you get the bubble down they need to actually do something to their backpack to get it going again the rate that it takes them to fix it would depend on the level.Id also like to see nulifers get a variety of weapons. Maybe a penta that they can actually kill themselves with if you can get them to shoot it at short range? That would encourage using maneuvers to kill it.,Warframe,d2pzuo4,1,t5_2urg0

7468493,0,t1_d2r1nw7,This is how Mass Effect  mainly the multiplayer does it. When your shields are depleted enemies also receive their own modified version of this you gain a very short invulnerability .s to .s depending on difficulty in addition to not taking health damage this has a short  second cooldown to it and it basically rewards good reflexes and use of cover. There is a very similar effect with health where if youd drop below  health the rest of the damage is ignored and the same invulnerability is applied this has  second cooldown. sourceI really wouldnt mind if Warframe had something similar with different numbers of course invulnerability duration is . seconds enough to get from an almost there position to a safer one but open not enough for open areas cooldown is  seconds the health version if its added but its not probably needed with a very long  seconds cooldown but it also removes status effects.If something like this is implemented it could open up some way for a Trinity Blessing nerf  getting instantly killed wont happen as often therell be some although not much counterplay to enemies like that therefore players wont have to rely on invulnerability from abilities to stay alive.

Its important to remember how to do vaults STEALTHILY because you get x affinity for not raising the alarm. Raising the alarm  times and getting all data results in the Spy turning into an Exterminate and that may be hard if you have  unranked weapons.For WarframesGet a modded redeemer and a TonkorAOE weapon with a silencer mod. Equip an unranked warframe slot in an aura slot and enemy sense and go do a grineer exterminate as stealthily as possible. I prefer the Grineer Asteroid tileset for this so I use Pantheon Mercury and stealth kill everything with the two weapons. When going for kills remember this Enemies have a line of sight.

Finding a nice corner to camp in that has a safe retreat spot is good for when youre on the defensive and need to recharge your shields. And of course use your abilities. Excaliburs survival ability is Radial Blind. Does what it says on the tin. It blinds people in a radial pattern. Whilst theyre blinded they cant shoot you and thats how you survive.

I know Ive gotten to MR just from trying out stuff because running the same set of weapons gets boring and obviously not all weapons benefit all frames to the same extent. Heck most of the time Im leveling something in one of the slots because I figure Im not using the pick one primarysecondarymelee anyway so why not get MR while Im at it?From that more holistic perspective rather than the more utilitarianmathematical view Id think the new sweet spot would probably be around MR depending on your weapons which lets you get your first couple of mandatory mods on a weapon and have it ranked up to a usable state so that you dont feel obligated to sidearm it. Someone whos already put in the legwork to get at least MR sweet spots aside gains an immediate benefit from being able to utilize a weapon toward the purpose of having it earn its own ranks if not necessarily in the most xpefficient manner.Either way that digresses into an argument of playstyle and perspective.

I dont frequent the forums but Ive seen much better suggestions that get fewer responses whenever I make a bug report.What the DC is perfectly set up to do in addition to what it already does is to curate suggestions from the rest of the forum that meet a set of criteria and to elevate them to a place where better discussion can take place and DC members can make cases for and against the suggestions.Example criteria Returns on the implementation are worth the effort put in Adds to the games growth for augments Offers a new playstyle to a weapon or warframe The actual criteria that DE set up themselvesStreamlining the polling actually seems to me like it would be one of the detriments to discussion and subsequently to Warframe. Why bother having discussions on proscons if DC members can just bypass it and vote on whichever option personally benefits how they want to play the game?And honestly  the main reason I participate on the subreddit and not the forums is that the upvotes and downvotes very easily filter out whats not worth reading.

I have  Nitain in my inventory right now you didnt slow me down one bit the player that started  months ago is probably going to get aggravated and   drop the game and tell hisher circle of friends to not bother with thisgame.

7645870,0,t3_4jz0li,Honestly these stretch goals as DE likes to refer to things as the sibear and now I imagine Vauban P as well have been a terrible thing IMO I would consider Trin P systems to also fit the bill as a stretch goal as well. These massive outliers in resource cost honestly encourage the very sort of behavior DE has stated they do not not like to see.On one hand I am completely baffled considering that during devstreams we hear things like we dont want players burning themselves out on a single node we want them to experience the star chart. paraphrasing obviously But then we get shit like this which on top of having an absolutely ridiculous distribution throughout the void is locked behind three other separate resource walls and in quite absurd quantities. Does DE not realize that these sorts of reqs encourage the very sort of behavior they have publicly stated they do not like? They dont like affinityfocus grinding on Draco they dont like Hieracon Corekey farming but man oh man now they are farming Cerberus for oxium things are really being shaken up. Do they not understand that all they have done is temporarily moved the hard core farmers to another slightly more corpusy loot cave? Has anything really changed from before? Is farming corpus on cerberus really that different than farming grineer on draco?To their credit I will say I am not completely outraged by the nitain cost so at the very least they didnt horrifically fuck that up bravo. I still believe nitain is a bad resource but individually the cost per component isnt drastically more than other items. The problem with the nitain reqs for Vauban P is that all components and the BP require it which is unprecedented as all warframes that require nitain up to this point have at most only had two components that require nitain to craft. IMO if all components require nitain perhaps the amount should be lessened I dont believe this to be an overly outlandish suggestion.I would complain about the part distribution throughout the void but at this point I think very little needs to be said as others have more eloquently been saying these sorts of things for monthsyears. I.E. C rotation in endless missions is ridiculously over saturated not effective use of unused rotations derelicts all but remain forgotten drop chances in endless rotations are not all that great. I will bring this up though this particular PA has brought about a particular void related fuck up that being that these new parts only drop from one location while certain things have been shuffled to drop in up to three locations... really this is helping keep void over saturation under control... gold star DE you did well.At this point Im tempted to call DE a bunch of fucking hypocrits but that wouldnt be very nice and I doubt this sort of shit is done out of malice but rather just out of disorganization left hand doesnt take to right hand all that well. But yeah honestly not a fan of hearing one thing from DE then getting a something completely different not in line with what they have said. ,Warframe,d3baln3,2,t5_2urg0

7652410,0,t3_4k2jj4,Heres the thing and Ive failed to capitalize on making the actual point elsewhere so Ill go ahead and make it nowLiterally everything in the game has other points besides the thing. Farming PolymerCircuitsNanosporesetc...? T and T keys on regular survival rare mods on Dark Sectors affinityfocus farming and all that are kind of a thing while youre there. You arent JUST farming k cryotic for a Sibear or  Oxium for a Vauban Prime certainly not as a new player. Youre farming the keys you need for other primes or for that matter rareasallgetout Vauban parts youre farming cores for ranking mods youre farming whatever resources are on that planet youre leveling frames and gear for MR youre acquiring focus if youre done leveling your current set of stuff. Being in the position of Farming and ONLY farming is almost exclusive to people whove already got the stockpiles of goodies and have well over  hours of gametime in their stockpile as well. Ive met MRs who didnt have Serration MRs who didnt have Pathogen Rounds... basic useful mods but basic is the keyword here. And many of the most useful and mandatory mods are dropped as Excavation rewards or during the course of farming various factions for those rewards. Keys and cores are dropped as Excavation rewards. And if youre running Corpus Excavation youre getting Oxium too.Yeah the costs are kinda ridiculous on some of the newer gear. I get that. But as an older player... and ESPECIALLY as a newer player... the cost is considerably lower than youre thinking it is. If you think youre not getting at least a thousand Oxium and several thousand cryotic trying to farm up T and T sabotage defense or survival keys just in between the individual sabotage key drops themselves youre either the luckiest son of a bitch playing this game or youre woefully misinformed about how long its likely to take you to get those items.Farm while farming while farming. Be efficient. The resource costs are steep yes but be aware of how many overlapping systems youre dealing with when analyzing ONE drop.Each Vauban Prime piece represents roughly  runs keysin different Void missions. In total we can expect to need to farm  keys for a statistically average Vauban collection run thats  T Sab  T Sab  T Survival and  T Defense keys. Might take more might take less. If were being efficient about it were doing this via excavation. The Tier Excavs give us most of the keys we want so were looking at  extractors as the fastest possible rate of acquisition... except were not. Takes  extractors to get there which assumes were pulling out at  just for keys so were actually looking at  extractors for just this set or  cryotic if were going as fast as possible. If were being pragmatic and going to  were looking at  keys   cryotic or  runs for  cryotic to get all the keys we need assuming we get only the keys we want each run. Because were doing the T Extractors on corpus missions were also looking at a few hundred oxium per run a  at  R cores on half of our extractors or around  cores per  cryotic plus mission credits plus cache credits plus various mods some of which are worth plat split chamber.This is just to get your keys for  of the  Vauban pieces. You still have to run Hieracon for the last ones which will get you the rest of the way to the goal. By the time youve got enough keys to get Vauban Prime statistically speaking youve got all the cryotic you need for BOTH Vauban and Sibear as well as most if not all of the oxium you need with most of the remainder likely getting picked up while in all these Void missions.So... yeah... from a mathematical standpoint it would seem that they calculated the resource costs based on how people are likely to go about getting the keys not based on stockpiles. Surprise surprise. Moral of the story I suppose is if you dont like guarding extractors buy Vauban Prime Access or trade for it.,Warframe,d3c1bkj,5,t5_2urg0

One of the reasons that snipers have that mechanic in CSGO is because they hit like a fucking truck and if you could move fast with that youd be unkillable. In Warframe no sniper has that amount of heavy damage. Furthermore even in Sniper Elite V which is practically a sniping simulator you can hipfire snipers with somewhat reliable accuracy however there is a soft falloff to their damage because at higher ranges its hard to actually target enemies a higher ranges which is far better of a system in my opinion.

Oh and Rage because melee channeling a lot.And a sword weapon with Crimson Dervish because x damage and easy finisher combo with the RMB combo of the stance and Life Strike.Pretty sure any weapon with a stance that has a combo that you are able to perform that ends in a finisher should work but I personally prefer the Crimson Dervish stance. Ground finishers dont count because they suck.I personally use this build and pretty much wreck anything nonboss usually always with full health and full energy. Most mobs without armor will die very quickly and if they have armor or are just simply tanky you just use the combo that ends in a finisher because what is armor?

And they are still strongly affected by communitys opinions there are weapons created by fans changes made because community feedback direct replies to common issues. Thinking that DE has time and resources to take every single or hell even small fraction of opinions into consideration and reply to them is just ridiculous and horribly selfentitled. You have poured out of your own free will thousands of hours to the game.Im not saying players opinions shouldnt be taken into consideration as much as possible but jeez I have a feeling that you dont understand how massive the amount of feedback is and how limited amount of TIME there is.

7756839,0,t3_4ljej3,Kind of a lot to read I think that the idea of changing link like that is fine I melee with her anyway as an ev Naramon is just too good. Why let someone hit you in the first place? I have a team to get hit and then healed! Being able to have an ability like that would make me quite happy.I truly dont ever use  or  as it is other when you get that thing that tells you to use your   times. The changes for well of life makes it sound like something that would be useful. If blessing was not a panic button I would be a little sad I think. If well of life was able to give damage reduction it would make using blessing as a reaction much better. It is quite easy to use it just as someone gets hit and dies then them not get healed at all.As someone that uses just about only an ev build I would have to say not including how ev would work around what you have said is a little odd. As ev is both an energy restore and a shield restore with mod the  being able to restore shields also would feel like there is a bit of overlap. With the energy cost that Trinity has not having some kind of way to rebuild energy would be harsh. Maybe making ev only restore shields and changing her passive to restoring energy for healthshields restored. Then having the mod for ev being gives energy when shields can store no more would open her kit a bit while keeping a lot of what she does as it is. Having it so she gets some energy back for healingshielding allows her to both self heal solo using the new  to do damage and keeping going in groups. Then if giving energy is what someone wants to do they could add to their own energy regen with the ev mod and give energy like the current ev.Im not sure how well it would be balanced compared what we have currently but it does sound like something that would allow more builds then than just ev or bless or a hybrid of the two. As she would have the ability to also do aoe damage it would allow for some damage builds maybe.The current changes make me think that they are only enforcing more of an hybrid build as range means nearly nothing and the damage reduction is team health bashed not just Trinitys.Changes like this would make me want to have some duration as a useful  and  is something that would be vary nice. But for now  duration!I have to say over all I like the changes you are suggesting. I would not be unhappy with them myself.

Rather than putting a hard cap on endless missions the enemies just scale until inevitably you cant beat them anymore.  That mechanic rewards you for being betterstronger since a hard cap would have a fixed maximum reward but a soft cap lets you extend that a little.However the cheese mechanics have undermined that design philosophy and created a whole separate endgame meta where youre fighting enemies you were never meant to defeat.There should be an official benchmark youre right about that  L or L or whatever should be the max that players are meant to fight against and anything above that is declared at your own risk and not guaranteed to be balanced or fair.  But I dont think that scaling missions need to be locked in at that benchmark in order to balance around it.

I just mentioned this to a friend the other day when we were farming for Orokin Cells and had run a survival missions three times without getting any cells. We werent having a lot of fun because the thing we were trying to do felt like it was being dangled in front of us and we didnt feel like we were even progressing. I feel like even if they said all resources that are commonly used in sets of one now require ten but the resources drop ten times more frequently I would be happy.

The negative power duration from it isnt too much of an issue to me personally since it only reduces the duration of Links and Blessing by  seconds but if those three seconds are worth the compensation of EV and Link range Id say go for it. If you really want to squeeze out some more duration without investing into Narrow Minded you could throw out streamline for Constitution. If you also remove Trans Fortitude for Intensify and Power Drift you wont need more forma too.

7837909,0,t3_4mm6xk,If you have a Max Rank item in any slot switch it out for a new warframeweaponcompanion when doing average missions so that you are always gaining levels which means always gaining points toward the next Mastery Rank.  When you beat a mission for the first time you get Mastery Points as well so working your way through Mercurys missions then next planet and so on you are gaining Mastery many different ways. Now when youre going to do something difficult for your level you obviously dont want all brand new gear so when I first started out I had  Loadouts  was for Leveling up and it was always changing as soon as  item finished it was replaced with an Unranked item.  This is not always possible but as much as you are able My nd loadout was all Maxed out things so I was doing the best damagesurvivability I could.  If you find a group doing a Survival or Defense mission and you start with everything equipped being Unranked or low level by the end of a good mission youll notice a huge jump in your Mastery Points from  different things leveling up all adding points.Just remember as you start getting to the Mastery Rank Tests that are more than Kill enemies with PrimarySecondaryMelee weapons you should start going to a Relay up the blue floating elevator in the back behind the wall and into the door on the Right.  Youll see a big orange cube thing floating in the middle of the room if you walk to the right though theres a ramp that curves up and it has a place for every Mastery Test to practice on.  You can only do ones up to the next one youll need to rank up so at Mastery Rank  you can do tests  and when youre ready to rank up and you choose the next test it will ask if you want to practice or do your qualification test that actually counts.  Because you have to wait  hours if you fail its nice to be able to do some dry runs to know whats going to happen rather than be surprised.,Warframe,d3x1r9l,1,t5_2urg0

7839257,0,t1_d3x0us0,More RNG that you cant prepare for? That doesnt sound like something the players would like. Most warframes rely on a single ability to stay alive. If its blocked youre often defenseless. Just imagine the reaction the moment we get corrupted variants of these units. Theyd be just as bad as the magnetic Shock Eximi that made a very brief reappearance.The only real threat are the types that dispel buffs Nul and perception Fog abilities depending on your warframe. But every time you hear the distinct sound you have to assume its the one thats going to kill you so why does it matter that its a false alarm  of the time? Getting decloaked as Loki or Ivara equals death in higher levels. Playing a Hysteria Valkyr and having this guy spawn in the next room? Better hope you didnt have a lot of damage stored. Having Iron Skin disappear half a second before you take a Bombard rocket in the face spells certain death. Or how about a Pacifying Equinox that doesnt stand a chance if the aura suddenly disappears?The purpose of this post isnt to complain about these enemes. I think theyre an interesting addition even if I would like to see some changes. But in my opinion Nullifiers are way better designed because they are easy to deal with if you come prepared. Just bring a Glaxion on your melee run or the new Akstiletto prime if you have a particular primary weapon you want to use. Shoot the bubble for half a second and watch it disappear.,Warframe,d3x77vi,1,t5_2urg0

But getting a good prime with all the plat and boosters gets you started nicely as you max out your mods.My first plat was used for slots. Fill them with all the frames replace with the primes as you get them. Buy a lot of weapon slots. Buy key mods for your main frame. Max one kit out.  Then go from there.,Warframe,d46hip8,1,t5_2urg0

For instance I pretty much cant stand how Loki P. Rhino P. Frost P. and Mag P. look their regular versions look so much cleaner andor less busy. A few formas and the regulars will play exactly the same as the primes.  of the time the stat boosts arent even noticeable in regular play and meaningless in extremely high levelAnd thats just the frames. Many of the prime weapons look worse than their counterparts. Paris Sicarus Vectis Boar Bronco Orthos Fang etc.Theyre a nicety but absurdly better concerning the prime frames? Not really.,Warframe,d46l7j5,5,t5_2urg0
7923055,0,t3_4nsn4t,The xp problem is a direct result of spawns and scaling. Draco is a popular spot because of fast spawns and and higher ranks mean that you have more heavies and eximus types spawn. If they rewrote the spawn code to include an even spread of enemies across all missions and ranks rather than on lower missions you see say  heavies every  or so enemies xp would be so much better as a whole. Then they still havent nailed the spawn locations down on bigger maps.

Hell DE would have a hard time letting people whove given up on the game mode know that there are dedicated servers now.

They make money by getting new players and getting existing players to spend money in game. I dont think dedicated servers will do anything for that stuff.I cant blame DE for not wanting to spend a huge amount of time and money to build something that likely wont give them any significant return.

8008953,0,t1_d4fyy1d,to appreciate what this new system could bring to what youve stated it seems that not only is there tokens in some form being introduced but DE are replacing the RNG Void key layer from the current model with another one that includes the token system. Steve said the Void is confirmed to be accessible as like a normal place on the Starchart without keys. So it would actually turn into this Run Void mission Get random Projection i.e. like a loot box with only the loot table from that tier and mission Run Alert based Void Tear mission for resources to craft said Projection  Craft Projection to get random Prime Part End product not what you wanted? Residual materials aka tokens bias your future Projection to only RNG roll from a specific rarity list within that specific loot tableAn example from what I understand it Run Tier  mission Ext Def etc. on Starchart Get Projection containing specific T mission loot table Run Void Tear mission to gather materials to craft Projection Craft Projection and get a Rare reward I really want the Uncommon reward. Use the Uncommon rarity Void Residual token to bias your next Projection to only RNG roll from the Uncommon Prime parts within the specific T mission.Steve also said we can farm up to a certain limit these residuals.

8052630,0,t1_d4l4z59,Whilst most of what the Tenno have done didnt make much of an impact in the long run we have primarily succeeded in our short term goals. I was wrong about Operation Sling Stone. It has in fact been confirmed as a failure. In Operation Cryotic Front the actual objective was not to stop the Balor Fomorians but rather to obtain Cryotic for Baro KiTeer so that he may give participating Tenno rewards that would allow them to succeed over the Fomorians. We succeeded in giving that scummy elitist his cryotic but he only gave us a Latron Wraith and some cold mods. I consider this a success as we completed what we set out to do. The Informant Event was all about the Grineer introducing new surveillance drones. These drones seem to only share the appearance of Regulators but dont function the same. We seem to have successfully destroyed most if not all of them. However like you said we have no idea about this events place in the lore and as such we cant exactly assess the impact of it.   The Cicero Crisis is essentially an ongoing  thing as the Grineer continue to attempt to poison Earths forests. However I count this as a success as Earths forests still remain proving that the Grineer were not able to wipe them all out. I see the lore surrounding False Profit and Divine Will differently. From what I deduce we managed to succeed in at least partially bankrupting Nef Anyo during False Profit. This is why it took a while for Bursas to reappear. I believe that the reason why Nef Anyo had the money to rebuild the Bursas during Divine Will was while we managed to steal from him we didnt stop his scamming of other Corpus thus he managed to become rich once again and reintroduce the Bursas and build the Razorback. And now he managed to succeed in his production of his Bursa Army. Basically we won the battle but not the war.This is why I believe these events and operations were successes as for the most part we did succeed in doing what we set out to do.Edit I realized I forgot about the Informant Event. ,Warframe,d4l6wav,6,t5_2urg0

The rework was successful if you ask me.Except shes got really low base energy and no way to restore her own energy outside of the things that every frame can use. That to someone new to the game seems like the problem with all the use these three abilities in concert to do the thing you previously did with one ability reworks. Theres no energy management addedin to make using three abilities in a row more affordable than the press  to win frames. If thats the way they want to do things where youre supposed to use your abilities in concert but using your combo drains you of the energy so you cant do the full combo again they need to make it consistent across all the frames at the same time.Instead of just reworking a frame to the new paradigm every few months and screwing them over comparatively while those that havent yet been reworked still get to afford using a useful ability. Abilities are the main thing distinguishing frames from one another and having every one of them locked into the use three abilities in concert to do anything paradigm just ends up making them too expensive to use.

Primed Reach also works well on other longrange weapons like the Atterax and Galatine.I mean you can believe whatever you want but it wont change the fact that some people do in fact want those mods.

8240761,0,t3_4s9t2g,Of all the different conditions in Sorties Radiation Hazard doesnt strike me as the one that needed a buff. Preupdate it was already reasonably annoying if only because it already prevented capping and reviving then but the radiation zones dont really feel like they add any interesting gameplay. Even in a previous Mars Rescue mission the clouds mostly just made running through certain zones tedious without some kind of healing or invincibility frame and on Interception they make some configurations flatout impossible to play without either resorting to those same frames or rerolling the mission until the clouds dont overlap with the radio towers. SotR has made a lot of potentially awesome changes that need some tweaking to truly work e.g. the Archwing update but this is probably an addition that needs to be flatout reverted.If Radiation Hazard really needs to be more intense Id say the best solution would be to just apply a permanent Radiation proc on every player throughout the whole mission and adjust the Confusion effect so that it doesnt block capping or reviving why should it do that anyway?. The core idea behind the condition is that you need to be more careful when using your weapons or abilities around your allies and the idea of environmental hazards could probably work better as another separate condition e.g. Hazardous Environment or something similar with a host of elemental zones everywhere.,Warframe,d57ngam,8,t5_2urg0

8250316,0,t1_d57yur8,Perhaps. Although people would no doubt complain about that too because it would radically change how you play the game. It would probably at the very least require a radical rework of how Nekros and Oberon cause health orbs to drop.There are so many underlying systems in the game right now that support the ability to rapidly heal that much of the core gameplay would probably have to be completely rewritten. Even if you gate the direct heals from Trinity etc I suspect that would just incentivise running Nekros etc which doesnt solve the actual problem it just changes it slightly,Warframe,d58ugj3,1,t5_2urg0

All you need is a decent crit double element and possibly bezerker melee weapon and build for boosting every stat a little bit and use radial blind for tough enemies. The stun from it multiplies the damage done I think by x.

If your goal had been to save as much money as possible you wouldve purchased the Prime Accessories separately and then bought the Prime gear from other players instead. If you needed plats you couldve waited for store discounts. This is what most people do.Additionally while its definitely good advice to not waste money on things you dont need its a little different when it comes to ingame currency since the amount of stuff you can buy with it is limited. Eventually you do end up with nothing else to buy which is where the packs become more interesting to purchase.

8311916,0,t3_4tc4z9,from my experience the only time the dread makes any advantage over rakta cernos is in x corrosive projection squads and only when you have the fanged fusilade mod. Otherwise the rakta cernos has higher fire rate better base damage higher travel velocity one of the best syndicate procs overall more usability and with argon scope will comfortably red crit. Its easier to mod requires less forma and in my opinion looks much better. Strangely enough the rakta cernos can even do more damage than a dread against high level enemies simply due to higher base damage also increasing combined elemental damage such as corrosive or radiation which always has the highest damage multipliers which also shows how overrated slash damage is. In my opinion Rakta cernos with  forma will do you much better than investing the  it takes to get dread to its optimal build. ,Warframe,d5gjou8,2,t5_2urg0

8334510,0,t1_d5jb028,Ive made a post or  about how I would rework Limbo and have recently been thinking that his  amp  staying separate could still work. Right now he seems note and boring because Cataclysm is rarely useful and Rift Surge is a boring selfbuff that offers no help to allies and no CC to enemies so he has only  regularly useful abilities and they are the same thing. If Cataclysm became more useful and he gained another useful ability then Banish and Rift Walk being similar wouldnt be that bad. Also them being seperate would make it easier for Rift Walk to be channeled and instant while Banish is durationbased and would probably still have casting delay. If they were the same ability like Quiver and Minelayer DE may be less inclined to allow one to be channeled and would probably make them both durationbased and have the same casting delay. Ideally they could both take up only  ability slot but banishing yourself is instant and channeled but banishing others is neither. But I dont know how feasible or willing they would be to do that.First off Rift should become consistent resources pickups power cells datamasses and consoles should be interactable in Cataclysm and AoE like Napalms amp environmental hazards shouldnt go through the Rift. This would make the Rift more reliable and less bothersome having to wait for a Cataclysm to run out to collect stuff. Also you could use Cataclysm in better ways like casting it around a console to protect yourself while you hack it. Ive also thought of either an augment or inherent part of Cataclysm allowing you to charge it before you cast the longer you charge it the bigger the initial bubble.His  should definitely not be an ability its too basic and offers no benefits to allies such as buffs to them or debuffs to enemies. One of the main problems of the Rift is that its usually dangerous for Limbo putting a Bombard or other kind of priority target in the Rift will endanger you if youre in there too. The only debuff they get is some impact damage while leaving and entering and the only buffs you get are energy regen and faster reloading and holstering and slightly faster movement speed. Those arent big enough changes to warrant a good reason to even use the rift especially since Limbos stats cant allow him to tank big units reliably in the rift or even face a squad sent there by Cataclysm.So Limbo should get an inherent damage buff while in the rift and become tankier whether it be an increase in health armor shields or a combination. Also enemies need more of a debuff. Perhaps lessened shields and armor while in the rift and they deal less damage. Allies could get lessened versions of Limbos buffs. This would make Limbo seem more like a master of the rift and make Cataclysming squads of enemies a viable idea.If his  amp  become tied together then the buffs could be amplified by a Rift Surgeesque power that scales with power strength amplifying the buffsdebuffs. Or if this ability exists then Limbo only passively gains durability but this ability gives him and his team more damage while enemies get reduced armorshields scaling with power strength.Regardless either his  amp  are together and he has a better Rift Surge or his  amp  are seperate and the Rift has inherent buffsdebuffs he would need  more ability and I have a pretty good suggestion. I think his last ability should be Rift Tear. It would be activated like Volts Shield where you tear it open into existence. It acts as a window and a door to the Rift. If you are in the normal plane and shoot through the window your bullets now are in the Rift. If you are in the Rift and shoot through your bullets are now in the normal plane. If you walk through it you will be put in the other plane. For balance I would assume enemies could shoot and walk through it too. Also it can be attached to Cataclysm moving with it while Cataclysm shrinks essentially becoming a window on it allowing you to shoot things outside of Cataclysm and jump through it.So overall if they make the Rift consistent and give decent buffsdebuffs then his  will become more viable and hell become more useful in general give a reason to use the rift and if they add another good power like Rift Tear hell have a good and varied enough kit that his  amp  wouldnt be that repetitive.,Warframe,d5jda3w,1,t5_2urg0

8365692,0,t1_d5n8uhs,Efficient trace farming can easily net you  tracesrun. Go with  Ivaras with maybe a Nekros and you can get a relic to radiant within  runs. Farming up relics is around as hard as farming up keys there are a total of  relics and  keys. The  missing keys comes from the fact that there were certain parts stuck in the derelicts all of which were a huge pain in the ass to obtain.Obtaining parts from relics is objectively easier and faster. Assuming that any rare item is stuck in the RotC of any Surv youll have around a  chance to obtain it  chance every  minutes after  rotation Cs which is realistic for pubs. Thats  hour and  minutes of straight farming in which you have a  lower chance of obtaining your item than the  fissure runs it takes to refine and run a Radiant relic. DE is likely going to implement some relic sharing feature with Nekros P theyve been talking about improving the relic system since SotRs release and have already made some changes. As long as it doesnt take you like an hour to find  other radiant relics to run with running the key properly is way faster.Its similar for other endless modes such as Defense and Interception that contain rare pieces. Modes like Sab and Cap might be able to rival the relics in sheer speed but keep in mind that those keys are depleted way faster and therefore you have to spend more time obtaining them. The relic system also gives you a use for keys that you get that dont contain your desired item. You can use them as fodder for trace runs to power up your desired key. In the old system keys that you didnt want were useless. On SotRs release someone made a thread where he did a bunch of math and showed that obtaining specific prime parts from relics was multiple times faster across the board peaking at a x speed increase when it came to super rare parts like Vauban Prime Sys. Since the time required to farm up the keysrelics stays relatively the same the grind is indeed reduced heavily. Stockpiling keys is no longer effective however which is what everyone is complaining about. Everyone is confusing Starting the grind earlier with less grind. Edit Even if DE made every piece rare itll still be easier to farm than Vauban. Assuming they go for a more realistic commonx uncommonrare or commonuncommonx rare itll be cake to farm unless you planned on spending time stockpiling keys prior to release.,Warframe,d5n9h4m,-3,t5_2urg0

Not having the passives tied to the actives is a good change that they should implement.My main gripe is that you completely removed the ability to have a healingfocused Operator. The vast majority of the Warframe powers in the game are either offensive or selfish buffs. Your Unairu stuffs closest to a school Id actually want to use but its still way too offensive. Weve got dozens and dozens and dozens of options to kill our enemies in new and exciting ways. Vazarin was about the only option to do something else and youd end up killing it off if this went through.Though overall your systems probably more scalable and adaptable than what weve got now so dont let my grumbling completely dissuade you. ,Warframe,d5ndo62,2,t5_2urg0

Someone running Hydroid has a similar issue in that the enemy at least needs to be held by the tentacles for bonus loot so leeches are mildly beneficial for the same reasons as they are for Chroma more enemies more enemies being killed by the thing dropping the extra loot.So... yeah... leeches are probably annoying when you actually need to try but the DSD mission has the pod with so much health that it really doesnt matter as long as someone brought something to kill things with. The leeches themselves are statistically speaking able to rely on the fact that in a majority of cases there will be SOMEONE out of the  other players that is using a farmframe sonicor or s. simulor and it wont matter in the first place if the leech is actually contributing. The credit farmer is trying to farm as quickly as possible and having to rely on the other players is not conducive to quick finishes so they set their kit for soloing a man. On Akkad that just means bringing something that does AoE.It is fairly annoying to be in the middle group between the leeches and farmers so I cant really help you much in that regard other than to wish you luck in getting more credit farmers to party with rather than the leeches.,Warframe,d5o1lh0,2,t5_2urg0

This means that while im not a presspowerhouse I can fill a lot of roles as one Warframe. My shuriken can quickly destroy a wave of enemies approaching in a line which luckily happens a lot in this game. I use my smoke screen to stun an enemy  like a heavy and then destroy him. If a teammate is down I can invis and teleport to his poor bleeding body and ninja him back to health. And when shit hits the fan and i need to fulfil ashs need for bloodlust i hit  and take a bite out of my sandwich.Ash can be built in specific ways and become EXTREMELY powerful but lets not forget he has some insane utility in his  and .

8403463,0,t3_4umgdi,So back in the days of the Orokin long before the time of the Old War there lived a high ranking commander by the name of Metanino. Being in a position of such prestige Metanino was accustomed to only the finest of items his custom gold syandana luxurious armor set and daunting helmet being prime examples of his opulence. Among his fellow officers and even the great Executioners his impeccable sense of fashion went unmatched. Executioner Ballas had been know on occasion to extol the grandeur of his appearance at gatherings among the elite. Even the lowly Grineer know for their vacuousness would tremble at his mere presence when he visited to overlook his various enterprises on other planets. Metanino prided himself on having the best there was around but was never satisfied with what he possessed. His desire to have what no one else did drove him on great expeditions in search of preOrokin fashionery. To have such relics from the past were the ultimate statement of fashion among the Orokin elite. The most legendary of these relics was know as the Apti syandana a syandana said to have been worn by a great king of old. Its divine elegance was detailed greatly among tablets strewn across the various planets of the solar system yet its whereabouts had been lost to all. To have such a treasure would be the only thing that could possibly satisfy the fashiony thirst of Metanino. His most promising leads had brought him to the aqueous caverns of Uranus where the old kings tomb was said to be hidden. As fate would have it the day came when he uncovered the tomb and brought the Apti syandana out of its moist grave. The writings of its splendor merely insulted the beauty of the syandana truly nothing could surpass the perfection of the garment. To celebrate the magnitude of his finding Metanino held a fashion party for all to display the pulchritude of their attire. Orokin elite from all over the system came to gaze upon the magnificence of Metanino and his syandana. Luckily Metanino had the foresight of such a large gathering and made sure there were more than enough refreshments for all those who might grow faint from his presence so that no one would have to wait. That way there was no punch line.,Warframe,d5rz8xg,1,t5_2urg0

8412708,0,t3_4uuwxx,I mean those two game design choices create quite different experiences and also affect the economy very differently right? Currently the Corruption buff is a cute extra. Youll probably get it when the missions already halfway done or mostly over and its RNG  nature hardly allows you to build around it tho you do have some control over when you get the buff unless the floor is covered in Reactant. Its like getting some confetti and applause for cracking your Relic and succeeding in the mission despite its increased difficulty level due to tougher and more frequent enemies.If you design the Corruption buff to be a more persistent aspect of Void Fissure runs tho the feeling of Void Fissure missions changes quite a bit. Now every Void Fissure is just a Pinata to be cracked open for extending your Godmode which could become quite extensive if not permanent if extra loot rolls from Prowl or Desecrate for example still apply to Reactant and youre able to collect new Reactant while still under the Corruption buff.So the gameplay shift changes Void Fissure missions from overall increase in difficulty with one spurt of godmode into at least occasional godmode which necessarily brings down the difficulty to at least normal levels if not below that which I dont think is the intended experience of these missions. Especially in the context of Warframe already providing copious amounts of cheese strats and infinite these and thats to its players to the point where the endgame AI can only keep up by deploying countercheese and growing into ridiculous bullet sponges.Moving on to traces When you give players more of a certain resource what used to be expensive now becomes cheap. Naturally you need to compensate by increasing the cost factor of expensive items. Which leads to crazy item costs just to accommodate a small fraction of veterans and extreme farmers and generally upsets the large majority of the community when looking at costs like  Oxium and  Cryotic and hoarding Traces has become quite easy since the last update gave you a very generous amount of extra capacity for Traces especially if youre a veteran. Which then again leads to people complaining about Warframe feeling like full of obnoxious grindwalls  to support its FP model. You getting more currency numberswise doesnt necessarily translate to having more currency in a practical sense when DE has full control over how many Traces are needed to upgrade a Relic or by how much an upgrade increases the drop rates of a Relic.Id also argue that these endless missions would be even more of a monotonous grind than the infamous TSRotCtype farms of the old system that were universally despised. At least in those you had brief Skinner Box jolts to keep you going every  minutes. But in your case youd most likely get a pretty reliable and thus more monotonous stream of Traces maybe with some variance that may tingle people upon getting an aboveaverage amount of Traces but I doubt it would tickle the brains of players in the same way.,Warframe,d5t4rye,15,t5_2urg0

8438998,0,t1_d5wbld4,This doesnt really stand up. the  ips mods on weapons with that damage type dominant  stick to  usually better are mostly better than or as good as some given elemental effect about half the time. For certain elements that kinda suck like gas and magnetic much more than half the time. It takes a greater than  differential to make elemental mods better. Its also worth mentioning that some of the best elements can be resisted where as nothing typically immunes enemies to ips. Now its a close race in the case of say collision force but for maxed primed heavy trauma the elemental mod is only better when youre looking at a  differential which is pretty damn specific.In the case of landslide the gap is somewhat wider.  since its fully impact its always better unless there is a  penalty or  differential ex  bonus to the element  penalty to impact. The net result is that its better to go all in on impact modding for atlas for general random mission running. Of course its also worth remembering that impact is effectively nerfed by x cp so you can run yourself into trouble if youre using impact weapons with a  man late game team. This does Segway nicely onto your general comments that ips mods generally arent worth it. Of course they need to be evaluated on a weapon by weapon basis however slashing damage is probably the best damage type in the game by a wide margin which is why buzz kill and Co are in such demand and why galatine prime will only avoid being the best melee weapon in the game if its actually worse than galatine. ,Warframe,d5wewp3,3,t5_2urg0

8440262,0,t3_4v93g5,Armor only grants damage reduction to health damage. Excal has decent base armor at . Which is about  damage reduction. So you should be using Vitality over Redirection. Also try to get your hands on a Life Strike mod. Best place to farm for it would be on Dark Sector Excavations due to the fact its only rewarded on rotation C every th excavator  waves of defense  rounds of intercept. You can just keep life strike at rank .Also rolling will give you immunity to most forms of CC Crowd Control and give you  damage reduction.Damaged without rollingDamaged with rollingIf you decide to build for Excaliburs Exalted blade. Then youll also gain a huge boost in survivability due to Exalted Blades auto parry that give  damage reduction to frontal attacks.My preferred buildNow keep in mind that the majority of Exalted Blades damage actually comes from the melee weapon mods. Some people also prefer to use Intensify over Stretch. I dont because of a few reasons.. Blinded enemies become susceptible to stealth damage multipliers Which is X damage with swords. This includes Exalted Blades Waves and status procs.. A bigger blind range improves your survivability by being able to stun more enemies in general but an even bigger boon is that it allows you to stun the sniper thats usually too far if you didnt have extra range. And as mentioned above blinded enemies get dealt more damage for the next melee hit.    More Range  More Enemies Blinded  More Enemies dealt X damage.. Increased range on Slash and Dash. Which is a huge mobility tool. You can bullet jump and aimglide  slash and dash to cross even the biggest of tile sets very quickly. Perhaps even faster than Max Power Speed Volts.Melee Mods If you dont have primed fury just use berserker or regular fury. Dont need primed pressure point either unless minmax or veteran with spare timeNow some people might be wondering Why the Expletive are you using Gas?

8619662,0,t1_d6ix0e2,In your third topic wouldnt Warframe currently be considered as a Pay  win game by your logic and reasoning? If you say thatBuy platinum gt Purchase weapon from store gt level the weapon gt Stronger weaponThen that means that this would fall under a Pay  win systemBuy platinum gt Trade for a maxed out mod with platinum gt level the weapon gt Equip the mod when you can gt Stronger weaponThis is possible last time i played stopped around the time the acolytes were added. Its not exactly cheap and does have restrictions MR to trade MR requirement for the weapon in question the credit tax for trading but its still possible to skip the time that it takes to max a rank  mod and obtain its benefits. You also said you cannot directly buy power within the game and that progression is based on the strength of damage mod but based on those statements you can buy power from the store. Although its a horrible value you could purchase fusion cores from the store which in turn would let you level up you damage mods and in turn letting you buy power. I also just remembered that you can buy credits for a very stupid price which would also alleviate the trade tax and fusion costs so there is currently a method to just use money and effectively purchase power in the game.

8621616,0,t1_d6jaroz,Except letting Snipers pierce the bubble wouldnt make Snipers better against anything else leading to ideally a sort of tradeoff. The opportunity cost of oneshot a Nullifier vs having to fight a horde with a boltaction rifle. The game already rewards melee especially Naramon and rapidfire weapons bubblepiercing on Snipers would give them a niche.Theyd just need to actually enforce it and not end up with stuff like explosives piercing the bubble or anything. Edit I should elaborate. I mean counterplay in the sense of youre aiming to make things easier against Nullifiers by the choices you make on the loadout screen not so much things you do inmission. Probably bad word choice on my part. Right now things that work really well against Nullifiers Naramon melee rapidfiring weapons also work really well against most everything else you have to kill shotguns being the notable outlier. Youd pick a Sniper with this proposed change to have an easier time against one enemy that really bothers you at the cost of having a harder time against others. ,Warframe,d6jaxc4,3,t5_2urg0

8682760,0,t3_4ythp4,Going to play Devils Advocate here. Please bare with me and comment instead of straight downvoting.On Spellbinding  The point of cast times is that you trade damage you would have donestanding still to take damage in order to use an ability. Its a fair trade off and prevents spamming of abilities which... well lets face it. We do and we abuse. Although Spellbind has a very short range for an ability at max rank it has an absurd duration compared to many crowd control abilities at  seconds. What this tells me is that they want you to Mod Titania and have tradeoffs through all of her abilities. AKA by modding you can favor some abilities over others but she is the first frame in a long while in my opinion where i plan on using ALL of her abilities.On Tribute  An ability with actual gameplay. Just personally most abilities in the game you use and an effect happens and its simple. These are usually straight damage or a straight buff and are no brainers because you should have them up at all times. We need to keep in mind that Titania is a good attempt at a support caster frame which means you should be casting a lot more than you should be shooting to support your team. Of course we jump to maximizing all buffs and trying to get them all up at once easily but it isnt supposed to be easy thats the whole point. These buffs are MASSIVE and some scale with mods.. to have all of them on once from a single ability is essentially god mode. BECAUSE they are all percentage based they scale infinitely into the late game. People I think underestimate how powerful of an ability is. It has ramp up time yes but the rewards and buffs are exponential when they stack. bar the companion buff  movement slow mini novafrost..  damage REFLECT sorry electric chroma AND a dodge that stacks up to ? thats  EHP from any and all attacks which means it doubles your health and shields. Yes it takes time to stack but if you want to take advantage of that you bring duration. I dont think she was designed to easily get all the buffs up but instead decide depending on the available enemy pool to bring a certain buff to the table. On Lantern I love this ability but have to agree with you here. Enemies seem to have a priority when it comes to aggro. Which realistically makes sense. Im picking something shiny vs something Im supposed to blow up otherwise i die or lose my job. I think it would be overpowered to work in a lot of defense missions though considering how strong that crowd control really is... we can already disable so many enemies in the game with a wide variety of crowd control Im happy to see something new. Whats more is this allows enemy grouping which means if you want to pilfering swamivara pickpocketatlast ore gazenekros desecratefocus farm one big group its really really really useful for getting that burst of affinity or loot. On Razorwing  Ill try and keep this one short because we can all agree she is really slow and Im pretty sure DE will buff this. What Id like to see is more elegance. See they took her  straight from archwing which means if you crash into something its the end of the world. They need to add more fluffyness and less bouncyness and forgive our spastic flying natures. We are fairies! we should fly with grace. Id like to see a big buff to her melee as it stands there is no real reason to use it vs the guns and its hard to hit multiple foes to cleave with it anyways.On Her base stats  I know you all complain about base stats and weve been spoiled with prime variants but guys... look. If you INCLUDE Primes she has the same energy pool as half the warframes in the game which is standard. Even though she is a caster frame I think it promotes less spamming and more how am i going to mod Titania efficiently. Same energy pool as other casters Zephyr Mag Nekros Mesa Oberon both frosts hydroid. Comon guys just use primed flow...As for her tankiness. Fairies are meant to be squishy. They are essentially one step up from a butterfly. Do you know where her tankiness comes from? her abilities. Dont just judge by base stats.  which we can all mod to last for.. well pretty much forever right is a straight up  damage reduction. You know what that means? she is automatically tankier than most warframes in the game. It just doubles her health and shields technically. On top of that she can get a stacking evasion bonus the ability scales with mods but i dont think power strength can increase it maybe it can of up to  evasion. So... multiplicative but  damage reduction on top of  evasion on top of having a smaller hitbox on top of  damage reflect on top of two powerful crowd control abilities?If you die cause she is squishy you SHOULD die it should be a normal thing of a nontank frame. If you die because you were not abusing all the utility she has to offer then practice playing her! No one gets it right off the bat. ,Warframe,d6qyxp0,2,t5_2urg0

The only advantage Nezha has over the two frames hes most similar to is the cleanse on  which is... okay? I mean thats not exactly a unique thing anymore though.

Once you get the relic refinement tool by completing the mars junction questtravel node on earth you will be able to see what the relics drop and refine them. To refine them run void fissure missions and kill shit as it pops out of fissures I believe matching the relic number to the fissure count to the left of the mission title gives you a fissure bonus not sure still figuring it out enemies that pop out of those fissures drop reactant and relics require like  reactant a mission to pop open so make sure to get all he reactant you need before you complete the quest so you can get a chance at one of the drops your relic has.Once you start running void fissure missions you will start to acquire void traces. You use these to refine your relics skewing the drop table in your favor. Exceptional flawless  radiant  void fissuresWhen you run fissure missions with others and they put up relics you all get a chance at awesome loot and if another guy gets it you Can choose his reward as well if you dont like what you get.I think that kinda covers it sorry this was done on a mobile so i didnt spellcheck like I should.Tldr grind relics like you did void keys. Run void fissure missions to get traces to refine relics. Kill void fissure enemies on void fissure missions to get reactant that unlocks the relics loot at the end of the mission. Void fissure missions can be found next to syndicate missions.,Warframe,d71z8jm,2,t5_2urg0

8777141,0,t1_d72rcn8,Spoilers ahead in case somebody else comes here and doesnt want to get spoiled from things such as the Natah Quest and The Second Dream.Spoilers You do realize the Orokin were scared of the Tenno and wanted to kill us right? They executed Margulis because she was protecting us. The only reason why they didnt kill us is because after Margulis execution Ballas decided to continue her work to create the Transference and ultimately the creation of the Warframes they only didnt kill us to be able to use us as weapons as we had the power to control the Warframes that they created. Lotus also ultimately gave us a purpose after we woke up as the Orokin empire was already destroyed while simultaneously hiding the truth from us to protect us only until Hunhow returned and with the Stalker nearly killed us and many other Tenno if not all the Tenno that were to exist. No the Orokin did not protect us as well as the Lotus she literally hid the Moon along with us in the Void for years a place where the Sentients who are out mortal enemies and wanted to destroy us would never be able to go to even herself as she is a Sentient until Hunhow managed to have the Stalker a low Guardian to be able to go there himself and try to crush the Moon itself with the power of the Void which ultimately led to the Lotus being forced to rip the Moon out of the Void to prevent our inevitable death if the Moon were to stay there which also led to the danger of the Sentients now being able to go there which is when we were waken up to be taken to the ships Somatic Link to be safe also keeping in mind that the Ordis tries his best to hide the Orbiter in the Void too most of the time where we are safe. The Lotus had many chances to destroy us as a matter of fact she contributed to the fall of the Orokin Empire as a whole where she only didnt finish her mission to betray her father and save us thus becoming the Lotus. Youre a very ignorant person if you try to speak about the lore like this but you do not know the truth. The Corpus are greedy and the Grineer want to expand even if they may negotiate and work with us at times they are NOT friends. If they are to work with us or us work with them either of the sides must earn something from that thats the only reason why Alad V even helped us on The Second Dream for example. Vor also attempted to capture us for the Grineer to use our power for theirselves and of course the Infested are just a very dangerous enemy with the possibility to expand and destroy everything in its path there is no negotiating with them. Both the Corpus and Grineer are wicked in their own ways so are the Tenno Lotus and the Orokin Empire itself we have to realize that but the Lotus gave us the purpose to keep the balance so that no side is ultimately the winner as much as it may cost lives and resources it is keeping civilians and many humans safe throughout the system and out of the conflict if we werent here with the Lotus help to keep the balance this wouldnt be true. She is a guide of sorts she shows us the way to something as it is for sure that she knows a lot more than we can imagine and then we have the power to finish the job.There is a lot more to this than you seem to believe. We arent going to have an unified system not like this. Stop thinking of the Lotus as she is the true evil here you seem to be very ignorant on the subject of how these factions are and with all the lore we have. I am not expert and even I know this stuff. I imagine the only way wed be able to be in a way unified would be for some sort of epic finale kind of deal against the Sentients maybe the Infested but even so I doubt we will at all be united after that and after whatever happened is done it is all going back to the same. Its a fight for superiority between these factions they wont stop until they either win or are completely wiped out. You also seem to overestimate us we havent even met the worst possible that we can see of the Grineer and Corpus most likely they could be far more powerful than we imagine specially with us knowing that the Twin Queens are Spoilers Orokin dont expect us to be able to beat all of these factions so easily with just sheer power we also dont have anywhere as many numbers as their armies although we are powerful we are NOT gods. These factions could have a lot of stuff hidden up their sleeves and be a lot more poweful than we can imagine the Sentients theirselves are massively powerful too and we havent even seen the true power of the Sentients only a few drones and basic combat units from their race.,Warframe,d72t7b8,1,t5_2urg0

You got killed by someone who could read your movements and shoot better than you and therefore got the kill on you before you could get the kill on them. Please dont reply with getting shot in the back constantly thats a problem in every FFA deathmatch game ever. gtAs long as there is only one frame one weapon one trick meta good luck populating even a single a server.This is not the case. There will always be weapon and frame metas based on usability to effectiveness ratio but that exists in every game. All weapons have different niches and tradeoffs and are actually balanced whether you believe it or not. Most frames have some way of being useful even if they may sometimes be annoying but they arent the thing that really alters playstyle. Okay fine melee is a different story but thats just a can of worms. gtTrue there are amazing players in TF and Overwatch destroying everyone else but look at the numbers. Millions play them despite that. At the same time in Warframe a majority of players only hop on the servers to boost standing with friends because they all think the way Conclave is setup right now is bullshit.Thats because most Warframe players dont like PvP but love shiny cosmetics. While that is argueably a fault of the game not appealing to its own playerbase I dont think that makes Conclave broken or unbalanced or ruled by jump spammers.,Warframe,d73e4z1,-1,t5_2urg0

My V Hek and S Tigris supposedly deal around that much DPS but in practice dont feel nearly as impactful. It feels like something is missing maybe Slash procs? Im not sure if the Atteraxother melees can get headshots it definitely hits Banshees Sonar weak points. Someone once tried to tell me that the War with Cleaving Whirlwind outdamaged Maiming Strike Atterax so I took both into the simulacrum Along with a few other weapons to test them against various enemies single target.

8889000,0,t1_d7gakf7,Sadly I am not too experienced on using Tail Wind so I did not know that it indeed would keep all momentum it was just some sort of idea that in the case that the momentum is timebased currently then in this case timing it properly to cancel at the right time to try and keep your momentum at an alltime high with Tail Wind. I have changed the losing momentum thing in the main post so that it keeps the momentum steady however I will still leave the idea of being able to reset it in the case that you can possibly improve it so that you go faster if done right which I would assume is possible and perhaps a good way to possibly increase your speed in case that youre skilled enough to possibly improve your momentum.Ive seen people bashing on Zephyr on a few things which I find a pity because I overall love her visual design and the idea of a wind controlling Warframe. I just find her lackluster and I am not too sure on how to use her too well at the moment but I know just a few things about her but I also understand that people like her as she currently is with a few uses with her which is why I tried to suggest a few improvements while trying to simultaneously keep true to her current kit while also adding a few ideas that Ive come up with myself and that Ive also slightly changed from what Ive seen with the community such as Tail Wind and Dive Bomb being combined for example.Sadly both this thread and the one I made on the Official Forums seems to have gone somewhat unnoticed which is a pity but I guess I can save it to possibly try and improve a few of these ideas as time goes on and hopefully eventually post it again and see how the interest in it goes I dont want to post the same exact thing in a short period of time after all so I guess Ill try and think of a few minor changes here and there and I thank you for providing some feedback on the momentum thing.,Warframe,d7gbyp6,1,t5_2urg0

Most of the base frames are easy to farm and the others have generally interesting quests.  Goes pretty quick if you give a shout on recruiting.  You should be unlocking them at a steady pace just clearing planets.For primes it all just depends.  Frames that havent been vaulted are generally cheaper.  Hit warframe.market site for an ides on about what sets run on pcpsxb though keep in mind thats the sets that HAVE NOT SOLD so you can get it a little cheaper doing buy requests.  Dont get in a hurry and you can probably get most primes for under  on pc.  If your new still going to have to do some serious resource farming to build.As for picking a frame?  Well best guidance I can give is hit warframe wiki strongly recommend uBlock due to invasive ads.  Early on that was how I prioritized what frames to build.

Rockets have a really small hitbox already and if youre already shooting at a wrong thing youre obviously not going to hit them.But you can in fact shoot down rockets. AoE weapons are best for it because you dont even have to care about aim. Ignis is best for this job as all parts of its volumetric fire will detonate the rocket.

The flavor makes it seem like its your best bet for stealthy offense but it performs very well as a defensive ability at close range can basically lock down an area for as long as you have energy. Its wonderful for maps where you have to defend an objective and if you mod for range you can basically stop enemies from getting close enough to hit you. And the augment just makes that ability downright sillyA lot of her abilities are pretty hard to take advantage of without a team for what its worth. You dont want to use Sound Quake when theres no one to draw fire from you or deal with the enemies you just stopped for example and shes squishy enough that she really appreciates not being the only one thats getting shot at. ,Warframe,d7n4k5d,16,t5_2urg0

Few know this but the ghosts in pacman have different behaviors depending on their color I wont go into much details but simply put each of her Tornadoes should have different priorities. one thats random one that targets and follows enemies one that you can steer by shooting at a locationenemy and one that follows you Now many wont agree with me on this one but hear me out Zephyr needs a different passive. Her light physics mechanic while clever and fitting it is a huge pain to deal with so what suggest is giving her the Mobilize mod as here new passive  Bullet Jump Aim Glide and Wall Latch. This simple change accomplishes the same results as her current passive BUT it grants player all the control. No more painfully slow drops no more double jumping when single jumping none. And thats it really. TLTD Combine her first two abilities Tap to go up Hold to come down.  Her Tornadoes should each have different functions instead of all just being random.

The issue with the shockwave not scaling is that once you get to level  enemies the shockwave damage will be irrelevant and youll be back to square  with the Boltace. The Telos Boltace will be stronger in the sweet spot where the Atterax stops being able to reliably one shot stuff And before its able to scale up but will be weaker as time goes on since it cant scale as effectively.

Guardian has saved my life more times than I could count and with the removal of endless void the amount of content it is useless for has been greatly reduced.

The reason  makes sense is because they have alliances so when you get status with one youll get half as much status with their ally. And lose status with their enemies.But you can only wear one sigil at once. So pick one and wear it and dont really think about spending status yet. Keep an eye on the interface at the front left of your ship which is your syndicate control.

9101940,0,t1_d85tkyr,gtIsnt this game still in beta?Technically yes. At this point though its only in beta because the developers want to keep the door open for big changes that you typically would only see in the beta stage of development. The thing is though that due to the free to play online nature of the game they dont have to hide behind the beta label just to make these kind of changes. Its a FP game not a  dollar game that is up on store shelves. The product you get when it comes to games like Warframe is not expected to be the finished product that stands on its own without any further support from the developer. For games like Warframe its expected to be a work in progress.

The exterminate on Sedna is quite good and will award over  rep per scan. The only downside is that it usually requires killing  enemies which is way more than you need to scan to use up your cap. A good alternative is the rescue mission on Sedna. Go ahead and scan as many enemies as needed to fill your cap and then rescue the prisoner and complete the mission. Like the exterminate youll get over  rep per scan and it wont take long to fill your cap. Youll be surprised how fast it is to do enough scans to complete your cap. ,Warframe,d8ccnjb,1,t5_2urg0

9178364,0,t1_d8fesef,There were  different Void keys not counting all the parts that dropped in derelicts. There are  different unvaulted Relics and no parts stuck in anything that isnt a relic and you farm everything in the same places. Its not the number of grindwalls that matter its their intensity. Farming relics and running fissures takes far less time than farming keys and running endless missions. Since the droprates of keysrelics are pretty much the same every key gives you a far lower chance than every relic. A  man radiant relicshare gets you a  chance to get a rare. A  man Cap keyshare got you around a  chance to get a rare Rare parts were all stuck at . The extra runs taken to get the Traces required to hit  would make the relic take a little longer to pop but the huge increase in drop chance more than compensates for it. Ive been playing WF since U and obtained almost every prime manually. Unless you had literally hundreds and hundreds of keys stockpiled new primes would often take weeks of casual farming Playing  hours a day to obtain a full set of. Nekros P took most people mere days theres a reason why despite being probably the best primary weapon the Tigris Ps price crashed so quickly. Also vets are the ones who care the most about obtaining primes because thats the whole point of gameplay in WF. Once you finish all the content available the only thing left to do is collect random crap. Once the newbies become vets theyll do the exact same thing. No point dumping every single prime item onto MRs. ,Warframe,d8ffat7,2,t5_2urg0

Less of a general and more of an elite soldier type of deal. Still gives room to expand on the lore where is the main hivemind etc but also makes them still prominent.gtThe infested in them in theory could also look more similar to the bosses as well due to similarities. Infested that look more like Lephantis with pink glow and the grays and browns being more prominent. Id love to see stuff related to Lephantis most of all for infested.Absolutely this. More variety in units is always good plus it gives a boon to DE because they can sell Lephantis Camo Pack Phorid Camo Pack etc which means that not only do we get content but they also get money.gtThen Phorid could maybe just be adjusted at some point and have his own squad of similar looking infested.Agreed on this one. Phorids whole Big Orange Charger thing is pretty old. A redesign is definitely in order and again more variety.gtMaybe more stuff with Eris could be cool and yeah Jordas is generally fine.Jordas is definitely in a good place at the moment lorewise. It would be pretty cool to see how the mutalist strain dealt with not having Rotten Salad in charge.gtIf anything I would love to hear more about infested at the source though. Both chronologically the exact deets and is there any place they reproduce most of all? Somewhere where the oldest infested of all still lurk?

I guess they wernt good enough to not need it for people to use them but just giving them Vacuum is a bit much so what can we change about them to make it fair to Sentinels that they are also getting Vacuum?Maybe its just me but from all that ive seen that seems to fallow their way of thinking.

If DE was balancing the game around ppl not picking up all the loot cant they just lower the loot drops but allow us to not have to worry about picking them up?Regardless vacuum is honestly not a gamebreaker for me.

Except in this case youre gambling real dollars for valve dollars which is even worse unless you feel like risking loopholes to get it out of the system. Valve gets a cut of every bit of the process from the money spent on keys as well as the percent fee for selling an item on the community market.Not to mention anyone with access to steam funds can do this form of gambling so you bet that  year olds and even younger could be spending their Christmas money on crates hoping to get that big score to try to doubletriplequadruple their money since they dont know any better and ultimately end up with nowhere near their moneys worth compared to if theyd have just bought a bunch of skins off the community market.Valve is profiting off of peoples compulsive gambling addictions except now instead of waiting until youre whatever legal age you can visit a casino in your area at you can do it from the comfort of your own home with no age restrictions whatsoever. Not affecting gameplay is irrelevant because these skins inherently have value so people who might not even be interested in the skins themselves gamble anyways to try to make a profit.,Warframe,d8jjxo1,4,t5_2urg0

9220101,0,t3_56m15z,My archwing QOL wishlist. make it so that aiming at the center of the target markers actually hits the target. Right now the marker is below the actual enemy for some braindead reason.. change the color of the markers such that they stand out against the background. having them a dull red often makes it easier to spot the enemy by the lens flare.. make the damn out of view arrows show up based on actual screen edge not distance from warframe! Right now they show up on the right side even when the enemy would be clearly visible between crosshair and screen edge.. when a enemy is behind cover put a X or something over the target marker. I wonder how many times i have been firing at what i think is a distant target only to be hitting some asteroid or something.,Warframe,d8kprch,2,t5_2urg0
9220232,0,t3_56makl,The blue is a bit too saturated giving a very Sharpie feel I suggest using a lighter tone. I suggest you use the deluxe skin as well has nice textures and such but its YOUR choice. Use Storm Row  for a good metallic on the Hulta Armor I highly recommend It. Make sure to make FULL use of the metallics they make great accent tones and really brings life to the piece. The armor pieces also look out of place maybe use the primary as the main color for it This can vary depending on color scheme. I also recommend trying out different color schemes this one is ok but kinda bland they dont really go that well together at least the tones that you chose silver and blue can work well together.

You should probably still look into the tax of the item you want to receive though cause thats the one you have to pay.Personally I just list and sell my stuff via warframe.market Chances are high that whatever item I cant list there is either not tradable or just too hard to define with a simple short search string like Kubrow Imprints for example.

Im not sure which one works out to more DPS on the Soma.EDIT I forgot the incredible crit multiplier that the soma has. Now Im really not sure of anything. Made a quick build on warframe builder so take all info with a grain of salt since their calculations tend to be best case scenarios or slightly off anyways.Argon Scope does less than bladed rounds when swapped and swapping out heavy caliber for argon scope is roughly the same as swapping out bladed rounds for argon scope.Without Heavy Caliber Damage | Type|. | Total Damage. | Burst DPS.| Sustained DPSWithout Bladed RoundsDamage | Type|.| Total Damage. | Burst DPS.| Sustained DPSWithout Argon ScopeDamage | Type|.| Total Damage. | Burst DPS.| Sustained DPS,Warframe,d8saur1,5,t5_2urg0

9346022,0,t1_d90k15s,gt From what I understand shotguns are preferable for Titania compared to Rifles.Incorrect due to Heavy Caliber existing on top of Primed Point Blank being much much more expensive to rank compared to Serration. Shotguns do not have the same amount of increase in base damage mods in as few mods that rifles do. Sure shotties have Blaze and Vicious Spread but you can achieve a higher base damage with one less mod on rifles. The only borderline advantage shotguns have is the  more multishot. Many shotguns dont have a noticeable benefit from fire rate as well.gt As you mentioned in the original post theres an option to go for increased status and slash damage too but I dont think thats going to be typically worthwhile for Titania.Its immensely worthwhile as slash procs scale extremely high into endgame. A fully slash proc modded Dex Pixia makes assassination sorties a fucking joke.,Warframe,d90obqp,1,t5_2urg0

You might consider giving Growing Power a shot for an additional  power strength or just running CP or something else.You could also ponder the idea of replacing one of the power strength mods with Energy Conversion for an extra boost.

Some subreddits do a weekly thread about a particular character ie. HotS reddit does weekly hero threads or... they used to. Maybe a Weekly WarFrame discussion thread?

If it is a minor problem I will ignore it and continue to work on the grander scheme of things.

9552347,0,t3_5bqg9g,Couple of suggestions If youre using TigrisP as the Primary for dismemberment purpose youll need a Slash secondary with higher sustained output to deal with encroaching mobs better. Tigris is rather slow when dealing with large number of mobs at once better to switch it out when no high priority enemy unit is in sight. BratonP is a better solution for Desecrate farm run. Full auto and a reasonable ammo economy. Even in occasion it does not mutilates your target on kill just keep firing at the corpse and it usually will. ReaperP dismembers just fine its just that for example NikanaP does that dismemberment job just as well yet with better damage and speed while OrthosP is also a fast weapon but with reaches significantly longer than ReaperP which means Orthos will maim the crowd with greater efficiency. I dont suggest using DualKamaP solely for dismemberment its primary use is for the heavy slide attack damage against something dangerous not to clear a large crowd of lesser mobs. ScindoP is another good alternative crowd killer that also dismembers although at the default it is rather slow but Tempo Royale fixes that to an extent. I dont think you will need SotD for a farming run well those shadows can act as a distraction but you dont really need the added firepower from those. Terrify is all it takes if you need a breathing room from being overwhelmed and it has a way faster cast time than a SotD. The build for any of the weapons are simply your everyday build tailored to whatever faction youre fighting no need to differentiate just because its a farming run. If a weapon frequently mutilates on kill it will continue to do so even if the elemental damage ends up higher than its Slash. The build for the Nekros is a capped or nearcapped Efficiency with as wide as Range as you can manage. Put Vitality on and fill the rest with Strength if you want to cover the losses a bit to make Terrify affects more target or put Despoil augment for even more efficient farming. The build will probably put the Strength  Duration into red so SotD will be gimped but Desecrate and Terrify will cover a wide area and Soul Punch snipes quite far to knocks a dangerous unit from afar. One thing I personally do though is to keep the status chance on the farming weapon as low as possible. Seems like if the enemy dies with elemental death effect often such as being burnt shattered melted Ill have less gain from the farming overall.,Warframe,d9qivq1,3,t5_2urg0

9572324,0,t1_d9s7o4e,The thing is I do not die unless I play extremely braindead or actually try to die.  I never played much of the Shadow game yet in the beginning it was designed to kinda give the Orks certain powers that made them more likely to kill you for these had certain mechanics assigned to them while your player character was rather mundane with his own strength.  Warframe on the other side makes us DemiGods. You can argue that a new player still dies to stuff yet even If I level up new gear with MR and Potatoes I pretty much get all the mods I need on the frame and walk among them like a living god.  Do I only benefit from this by making myself weaker or deliberatly trying to die to a specific dude for his nemesis has random item X on its loot table?  Imho turning death into a mechanic of its own requires the game AND lore to be set up for that from the beginning. Shadow of Mordor is an Example for that and so is that friggin Futurama game or Dark Souls.  Warframe? Not so much.,Warframe,d9szfwc,1,t5_2urg0

I personally do not enjoy conclave so I got myself to the max rank for sake of completion and havent touched it since. Its super weird that DE pushes this mode so hard with all the frequent balancing unique conclave only mods and stances.

Worth affinity ?It doesnt gain anything because scanning does not work without scanner chargesgt when you equip sumariss scanner Helios consumes charges to scan does it scan and count as a sumaris scanner ? Like when Helios scans a corpus and it says  points these points goes for sumarisNo. Helios scans do not give Simaris reputation. They only give codex scans even if they are using synthesis scansgt If so does the upgrade sometime scan worth twice that you can buy for . apply too for helioss scans ?Yes. It gives a  chance to give  codex scans from one scan. But its not very useful since it does NOT give simaris reputation only codex scans.

Peacemaker when enemy numbers start to get overwhelming.

Or stat weighting with random swings between stats.For example right now you can get mag capacity about as easily or even in less quantities than you seem to get damage.

9691146,0,t1_da7eivp,You get lenses either from sorties or from the market. These lenses are applied to weapons and frames only at level . There is  lens for each focus school. When you gain affinity with that gear a percent of it is converted to focus for the focus school of the lens. You then spend this focus to upgrade the operators abilities.That is the basics.When you have at least one lens equipped in missions focus convergence will spawn. Picking these up will boost your focus gain for a short time.Keep in mind that focus is gained by the gear the lens is equipped on. As such putting it on a weapon and then nuking everything to the ground with an ember or something will net you very little focus. For maximum focus gain you want a lens on the weapon and the frame.There are also upgraded versions of lenses greater lenses with much greater focus gain. These can be crafted or purchased in the market.,Warframe,da7n0x0,2,t5_2urg0
9691203,0,t1_da7jxij,I share your Opinion on warframes gameplay. The meat blender playstyle of most warframes out there just looses its charm after a while and my biggest problem is this almost complete lack of player interaction. IF you want to solve a problem just use an ability and blow the world up.Interestingly enough i found this to be caused by the complete lack of single enemy significance except from a select few cases. You dont fear a shotgun pointing at your face and heavy units are mostly easily dealt with. this means that the enemy needs raw numbers to be any sort of danger and then we end up in a situation where tactics means little and Mass CC effects  kill moves take the center stage.Then there are the cases where those enemies do matter tho. Void shot gunners forces me to be aware of the situation and use my manoeuvrability to get the edge over them. void bombards is perhaps the only enemy unit ive ever heard being pointed out by my team mates as a threat and sortie corpus tecs do so ridiculous amounts of damage that they just have to be dealt with FIRST.All these cases warframes gameplay for me at least shines but these few moments of glory is by far a common occurrence. ,Warframe,da7na1a,4,t5_2urg0

9771405,0,t3_57ffu9,Old thread necro here.The reason Mag and Excalibur worked was because Excaliburs Exalted Blade does a whopping  base damage and with minimal mods on your Melee weapon does far more damage than most weapons early game.Excalibur can cut down the legs in no time and Mags Magnetise serves as a damage amp when the Jackal is down and torso is vulnerable directing all shots to the centre and even doing strong damage over time from stored damage.However the issue with Mags Magnetise is that it redirects bullets to the torso even in the leg phase which makes it impossible for you to actually damage the legs with ranged weapons. Excalibur worked because the powerful energy waves dont obey Magnetise and can cut through the legs anyway.So with Excalibur contributing to leg phase and Mag contributing to torso phase the fight becomes very easy while Mag can actually interfere in leg phase if Excalibur or a sturdy Melee frame is missing due to the way Magnetise works.With Paris and Kunai which deal primarily puncture damage shields are difficult to rip through puncture bonus against Armor. What would work though are Impact weapons or elemental mods that have Electric Cold or Magnetic Electric  Cold elements on them. The way the modding system works places the majority of damage into elemental mods and so generally we mod elements to match enemy type. In general magnetic for Corpus radiation for Grineer and corrosive for Infested.Put these mods on your weapons or buy a Braton  a solid choice for early game. ,Warframe,dahjisi,1,t5_2urg0

It might be a bit worse to do dedicated grinds but it is so much better for just running stuff with PUGs and getting decent rewards.  Random intact relic running nets you an average of  chance at an uncommon reward and  chance of a rare reward every mission which means its decent at farming parts over time which can potentially be traded for the specific thing you actually wanted.  ,Warframe,dai0v31,3,t5_2urg0

9786777,0,t3_5fba5g,As someone who almost plays Titania exclusively at this point I agree with you. I do think that Razorwing performs well on its own as it is though. I can play Titania during sorties and still cheese enemies even most Sortie bosses condition willing. Because Razorwing is already quite powerful I might suggest that razorfly respawning be an augment for the ability. I dont think that would be much of a bandaid augment though since Razorwing hardly needs a bandaid just a couple of minor adjustments like being able to interact with players and reducing the size of her hitbox and the power is only marginally less useful without your razorflies. That said unless DE is going to give us a new animation for holding objects of a tiny bugframe dragging along an object twice her size I wouldnt much want to be able to carry things like hacking devices or power cores while in Razorwing mode. I would be all for opening doors reviving allies hacking consoles and etc. though. It would just look silly if she picked up an object only for it to shrink down to her size or for her to go into the standard animation for carrying this object with one hand and holding a secondary weapon in the other. Now if the new animation for that had her struggling to carry it with both hands cause the power core is actually way bigger than she is . . . well thatd be cute af and Im a sucker for cute af.,Warframe,dajflzq,1,t5_2urg0

If its your suggestion then perhaps its not really that big of a deal but it is a Tenno faction.gtThere are tons of Dojos and theyre far from huge and well armedHuge is subjective and some are very large. Well armed? Why would we need to arm them? We have our own Solar Rails and we used those for Dark Sectors.gtmuch less significant than the Corpus Jupiter labs or Kuva fortress. Jupiter doesnt really have labs there are a couple that are maybe actual labs but otherwise theyre just large bases. Same with Kuva Fortress.gtMy idea is no more stupid than your ideas considering the lack of evidence for either. Your suggestions potentially break lore or open up a lot more problems. Mine at least make sense given the context and closes more holes than they open up comparatively at the very least.gtThe circular things on both their backs could easily be based off the Prime.Gersemi could the normal Valkyr one couldnt be. Why? BECAUSE ITS DUE TO THE ZANUKA PROJECT. gtI own Valkyr P and the crown is fairly low on the back of the head which compells me to think that its supposed to be reminiscent of her other skins.From a nonlore speaking point probably. Why? More people are aware of postZanuka Valkyr rather than Gersemi or at least newer players would be. But from a lore standpoint it makes no sense.gtVauban P isnt just pointier Vauban it has a completely different helmet and a trench coat.It is pretty much is. I saidgtgt Vauban Prime is just a pointier Vauban if you have the Steam skin you can see its just extra pointy bits and a little flair that add onto it.The little flair is basically the trench coat and more pointy. And normal Vauban has a tiny bit of a trench coat thing Prime just extends it really. The helmet is different but so is Trinity Primes but the rest of Trinity besides the lobster tail is pretty much the same again! Vauban and Trinity got longer nearbutt stuff and different helmets theyre not much different though.I didnt say they were exact copies more like the older Primes but they are still pretty similar. Nekros is a major exception. Nekros doesnt have a story about being captured and changed though so why is his so drastically different? Doesnt really matter right now but Gersemi skin is what normal Valkyr looks like prior to the Zanuka Project. Valkyr Prime has nothing to do with why Valkyr looks like Valkyr FROM A LORE STANDPOINT.

9871452,0,t3_5gq8j0,Find a frame whos powers compliment your penchant for gunplay. I like Volt personally his one stuns enemies and doesnt interrupt anything you are doing his two helps you move around faster reload faster and melee faster and doesnt interrupt what you are doing. Electric shield is great if you need to camp and increases your damage and Discharge gives you AoE CC for when things get tough. Alternatively Mesa build her for standard range and good duration with a bit of strength keep  and  up at all times and just shoot things. Alternatively Mirage same thing duration and str with we range and keep  and  up at all times and shoot things. Or Rhino use  to cast  and keep  up and shoot things and periodically stomp dudes.Or Chroma keep  and  up and shoot things. Idunno the list kinda goes on. Look at your powers on the frames you like and look at how they can help you do what you want to do. ,Warframe,dau9uza,4,t5_2urg0

9926784,0,t3_5hngaa,Most warframes are splt into four parts A main blueprint a chassis blueprint a neuropticsalso called helmet in older sources blueprint and a systems blueprint. Ideally you should get all warframes for the mastery and to get a taste of how they play. If youre looking for a frame that can get you through the starchart excalibur rhino and frost are good for that.Excalibur can be chosen as a starter. Rhino can be farmed at the node fossa on venus. Frost can be farmed at the node war on mars. Keep in mind the main BP for these two is bought in the market and you wont be able to build them until you gain access to neural sensors jupiter. The majority of loot youll get is mods resources and endo a resource used to level up mods. Youre never going to get built weapon drops from enemies but some Heavy gunners and drekhar troopers can drop weapon blueprints and any eximus unit can drop blueprints for the oberon warframe.,Warframe,db1hgys,3,t5_2urg0

DE will never make Oberons healing capabilities better than Trinitys. Oberon already does some CCdmg with Reckoning amp Smite so he already can fill Embers role. Not entirely ofc but in his own way. And saying Oberon will replace Frost with one defensive ability is outright stupid.ampnbspOberons carpet is a pretty nice skill but it lacks in usability. For example. it can be in a bigger radius not current weird rectangle.. it can give a bigger armor buff and remove status effects to everyone who passes over or glides over the carpet.. it can also work like Vaubans passive to give Oberon more armor for each teammate who passed the carpet.ampnbspRenewal could instead be. a constant ability that links to nearby allies kinda like Trins Link and heals them over time but keeps going until disabled. . could give armor or damage reduction.ampnbspSmiteReckoning could have an Avalanche augment treatment where it gives a bit of Overhealth for each enemy who was hit. Nonstackable ofc.ampnbspOberon might even get a new defensive skill that makes him slower but grants proper paladinish tanking.

With ability to choose people would just choose their favorite weapon or weapon type and there will be nothing left but extra number powercreep.What should we focus on is getting DE to improve the overall accessibility of Riven mods  increasing chance of getting any riven mod from sorties allowing recycling riven mods for a new one syndicates and so on.,Warframe,db7zcso,-1,t5_2urg0

9986150,1,t3_5ikpin,No and the reason is you can become too OP that way. Got fantastic stats for Soma but negative multishot? Lock the good stats and reroll the other and hope for another good stat. Weapons would become too overpowered and balance would be even more difficult to obtain.Yeah wed all like to have super OP mods but then there are players at a massive disadvantage comparatively. Theres already a gap dont make it bigger. Dont let Rivens become the new meta.It would be nice if we had some way of influencing the mod though. Like the weapon its on determines the weapon type shotgun rifle etc and other mods on it influence the elements and other stats. Default weapon no mods? Completely random stats then. Freezing flame thrower stats and cold? The mod will more likely select more cold damage though negative sideeffects will still exist to make sure it wont become super OP.,Warframe,db981yo,3,t5_2urg0

9992564,0,t1_dba1jyf,So youre basically saying that because people who cant parkour quickly enough they should not be able to get rewards or kills? Ive played this game so long that I know virtually every tile like the back of my hand and zip through them way ahead of all my pub teammates. By your logic Im the only one who deserves the rewards because by the time they get to extraction Ive already started the timer and it has ticked down to  seconds left. I am being logical accessibility is a good thing because it is inclusive of everyone whatever their playstyle or skill level is. I believe that even those who cant afford to spend thousands of Plat on expensive setups should be able to obtain the things Im obtaining at the rate Im obtaining them at. SS Mirage enables this. How many players can pay for Maiming Strike cough up  Plat on the spot? SS Mirage doesnt discriminate almost anyone at MR has equal access to her strengths. Nothing wrong with equality for those with limited resourcestime. Thats your playstyle and I have mine. Everything that you kill is something that isnt being killed by a teammate. Killing enemies is indeed an integral part of the game and Im killing them. Im sure you wouldnt be the one complaining if whatever gun you had was the meta instead and wiped out every enemy before your teammates saw it. Second time. The kills are right here if you want them come get them. ,Warframe,dba24yd,1,t5_2urg0

Loki Prime. Ideal for Spy and Rescue missions. With the right mods you have an extremely long invisibility and can run through it super fast! Frost Prime. With a good snowglobe build you can easily do high level Excavations and Mobile Defenses. Inaros. Just for the sheer tankiness. And he is a guaranteed frame after the quest is completed. You do want the Inaros Anubis Helmet for him for fashion reasons though.But there are so many other awesome frames...like Nekros Prime or Ember Prime.If I were you I would try and snag myself those two frames as long as they are unvaulted!,Warframe,dbcyj0k,3,t5_2urg0

Who knows if theyll even read it but hey.Hello I just wanted to let you know that the new pop up for users who have adblockers installed in their browsers was one of the least well received decisions I believe you could have ever made concerning your sites. The reason we have adblockers installed is for sites like yours who fill the pages with so many intrusive ads we can barely get the information we need for the things we are passionate about. These people you are locking out are only going to stop using your sites as this is the internet and there are other options. You are going to drive away the userbase that even though they block the ads bring you the population that gives you the views for the ad revenue. I ask that you stop this action immediately or reduce the intrusiveness of your page ads so that we may use the site without it slowing down andor crashing our browsers causing us to click things we did not intend to click on and playing loud sounds automatically in the background.

And doesnt fix the issue.The issue is simply that vacuum should be at this point built into frames.Im not talking about the tiny little buffs that Sentinels give now. Im talking about giving something impactful like Charm to every Sentinel. Hell give each Sentinel a unique buff. Smeetas lose their charm heh puns! when youre at the point where farming for resources isnt that necessary which a LOT of players are at. You can offset that in that players doing raids arent looking to get resources. So give them a sentinel buff that heavily helps them.There is no reason as to why Vacuum has to be limited to Sentinels. Just give Sentinels a worthwhile buffing ability. Hell give them charm too if you really think thats what needs to happen.Vacuum shouldnt require a Sentinel though. ,Warframe,dbh4qfi,-1,t5_2urg0

And this would be a huge backpedal from them saying they were against Warframe Rivens already.  However.  IIRC the datamined info shows that all the frames have a disposition of .  Which... makes me think it isnt exactly Rivens for Warframes.  I mean nobody is stupid enough to believe frame usage is equal and Rivens are as said by DE supposed to basically make unpopular weapons usable and up to par.  Disposition regards to how popular the weapon already is.If all frames have a disposition of  then either they believe frame usage is equal or this system has nothing to do with buffing based on popularity.

10074027,0,t1_dbk77zl,The main selling point on the Vectis for most playersI said most. Dont say you like two shots I simply dont give a fuck. was the one shot reload mechanic. It increased firing speed because you can reload instantly if youre out of shots. With the new Vectis Prime you have  shots and you cant instantly reload after the first shot because of weird game mechanics and it also doesnt fire fast enough to compete with the normal Vectis speed of shootreloadshootreload. So there was a bunch of peoplemore like  of the subreddit and  of the forums numbers exaggerated and pulled out of my ass who were like aahhhh and DE responded.How did DE respond? With a bandaid mod that cuts magazine size in half a mod that takes the place of a  elemental or punch through mod. Another problem is that there was no other use for that mod on any other weapon in the game. Vectis is the only weapon in the game that you would want  shot and  shot only on. No other weapon could make use of Depleted Reload. It was effectively a useless mod designed particularly only for the Vectis Prime.With Depleted Reload you get a gun that feels like the base Vectis but doesnt feel like a Prime. Without Depleted Reload you dont even have a Vectis anymore you have a new type of sniper.And this was the beginning of me hating bandaid mods. ,Warframe,dbko1qs,1,t5_2urg0

10093094,0,t1_dbn45x6,As another Zephyr main wow this club is so tiny I will be adding my three cents Turbulences protection depends on the Power Range so try to keep it around or above  so youll be sure that no stray bullet will hit you. Sadly somehow Scorches Ignis attacks can go right through your windwall no matter the range however it is really useful for attacks that otherwise will go after you forever like Phorids missles Divebomb can be a really cool crowd control ability with its damage scaling with the height from which you dive. It knocks down everybody in its radius can be casted even if you just barely jumped and almost always activates the Heavy Impact effect provided that you have it on. The augment is like Mags Pull but from every direction and if you enjoyed that then feel free to pick it up. Dont bother with your Tailwind as a damage dealing ability. It feels kind of weird IMHO. Its an ok mobility skill but thats about it. Oh and Tornadoes. You cannot shoot through them. If theres an enemy behind it they wont take any shots. And as uKomodoSaurian said they take whichever element they get damaged with but there is a priority list Corrosive Viral Magnetic Gas Radiation Blast Toxin Electricity Cold  and Heat ranked from highest to lowest innate Magnetic doesnt count here. Once you get Corrosive tornadoes you wont be able to change its element until they disappear.Sadly I dont have screens of builds with me but one build that I recommend especially for hostage defences is the Mobile Snowglobe build. What you need is as much duration and range as you can get and your Turbulence will protect everything insideI also experimented with the Divebomb CC maximizing strength and range at the cost of duration which resulted in very funny hops whenever I want to use Tailwind from the ground. The feet barely leave it. Its really fun especially with the augment to throw enemies to the ground,Warframe,dbn59o0,3,t5_2urg0

10094244,0,t3_5ke9e1,There are  builds. EV Blessing hybridPretty much all builds want flow and QT and can forego efficiency as long as you are packing flow and good at keeping up your EV.For EV trin you want strength and range with as low a duration as possible. At minimum you need to have either a maxed fleeting expertise or transient fortitude preferably both. The range of the energy pulse is fairly high at base so stretch should see you through nicely. You can substituteadd overextended if you really need that huge of a coverage area. Vampire leech is a huge bonus to survivability and highly recommended. Natural talent for QoL. One last note is that just because you are an EV trin doesnt mean you can ignore your other skills. You can combo your  and  to infinitely drain a single target. Your heal for blessing is still powerful so hit it and hit it often unless you have a dedicated blessing trin on the team. Use link to waypoint enemies for you. Very useful if the minimap is being wonky or you have no enemy detection.For bless trin you max out duration over everything else with just enough power strength too hit  health restored. You can still EV and kill the target manually to gather energy. You can forego some duraiton for range so you can cast link for more survivability. Your  and  also double as a super long single target stun.For hybrid you need to adjust strength range and duration to fit your taste. Usually ends up building very similarly to blessing.,Warframe,dbnan6n,2,t5_2urg0

Its the same deal with Limbo no one wants to deal with his shenanigans at the moment because it hinders them more than it helps and it makes the game less fun for them.I play a E Nidus and I have absolutely no trouble getting my stacks.

Look at all the issues like JVExcalMagAshOberon that were left in the dirt because we stopped making a fuss about it. The same thing will happen to every issue that we dont keep in DEs mind.And its important to not stop because once you do stop its much harder to start it up again.

Status would be up to the user to just switch the elements depending what theyre facing. I think thats the most common sense part.You can also exclude mods that you cant access or dont like using such as argon scopebladed roundsprimed mods.For example if you roll mag capacity for tonkor wildfire sometimes becomes part of the build if the ele works and sometimes primed fast hands depending on the Riven.

10260182,0,t1_dc71c5o,They arent bad because theyre strong theyre bad because  of their strength is locked behind lottery levels of RNG. No other aspect of WF is nearly as reliant on chance as Rivens. As a result their rewardeffort ratio is completely out of whack. You could spend months rerolling a single Riven hundreds of times only to make  progress toward your ideal perfect Riven. You could also unveil a perfect Riven on your first try. There is no sense of progress or reliability of any sort. Whether or not you get to access the full potential of whatever weapons you have is decided by the results of your randomly drawn lottery ticket. The chances are seriously that low even previous stupidly rare mods like Vengeful Revenant and Final Harbinger had at least one in a thousand chances of dropping and didnt affect gameplay much. Riven mods make and break the viability of weapons and have the  in a billion roll chance of actual lotteries. Even if you had an infinite supply of Kuva you could literally do nothing but spam click the reroll button until you drop dead from malnourishment and never even come close to that desired perfect Riven.Lets look at the layers of RNG. Hope Riven mod drops from sortie and is of desired type Currently  types so about  which gets worse as more are added.. Hope Riven is for desired weapon How many weapons have Rivens?.. Hope you roll the correct stats Out of the dozen or so stats that can come in each slot..

With Rivens there is at least a chance of getting something awesome and boosting some of my favorite weapons and in some cases getting me to pay attention to weapons I ignored before. Im not sure why you are getting downvoted for that though. I can certainly see how someone could look at Rivens and think it isnt worth your time or effort.,Warframe,dcicwqg,1,t5_2urg0
10360328,0,t3_5obzc5,gt Especially seeing most of them seem to be for weapons I have no intention of using. Thats the entire point of the system. To give lesser used weapons a shot at being useful for the endgame. Crossing your arms and saying Nope not gonna use it if it isnt for my favorites is kind of a dumb criticism. The RNG part I get but I personally dont think or want that randomness to go away. Part of getting a powerful or useful riven is for that feeling that youre one of the few people that has an item like it. So much of the gear and mods in this game are so easy to getcommon that it really makes builds feel more like a been there done that sort of experience rather than pointing to an aspect of my build thats effective and has personality.As far as Riven Stat variety I wish DE created unique riven abilities opposed to just straight damage buffs. I feel that while Rivens have made certain underused weapons more enticing to use it underscores a fundamental problem that the system as a whole tries to address that a number of weapons really dont feel that unique in and of themselves. Just look at the hitscan weapons for example. The Stradavar and Zarr alt fire are a step in the right direction in that they allow for some changeup in playstyle on the fly but the Braton gorgon soma karak ect all are really very samey in use. Same for the Burstron vs Tiberon. What meaningful difference is there between those weapons where youre not simply sitting back and thinking Im essentially using an upgraded version of weapon X? The Riven system tries to bring more weapons to the fore to seemingly get older players to go revisit their old arsenal with the new content theyve developed but it only really seems like a half measure. Basic damage is something that all weapons already share giving a weapon some new behavior conditional skill based action that scales with endgame would separate it from the flock would be much more effective imo than simply boosting its stats and allows for greater customization.         ,Warframe,dciek23,5,t5_2urg0

Youre destroying your progression curve. Primes take WAYYYYYYYY longer to get than regular frames. Youre skipping right to the midgame grind before even doing the easier earlygame one. With most normal frames you simply fight a boss and get a chance for a part. With primes you farm for a relic then fight for a chance at a part. Thats  level of RNG vs  levels respectively.

10411681,0,t3_5p4972, Part  IPSE Mods Impact Puncture Slash Elemental  Currently it is not mathematically effective to use IPS mods unless the specific Impact Puncture or Slash damage constitutes at least  of the base damage and only then for the  version of these IPS mods.  This is a very counterintuitive design problem that only becomes apparent via reading the Wiki. To counteract this added IPS mods need to add damage as a percentage of the total base damage just like Elemental mods instead of a percentage of that specific IPS damage type.  On the programming side this might require the creation of secondary damage types that are superficially similar to the base damage type Impact Puncture Slash but mechanically function as a new series of elemental mods Crush Pierce Lacerate with the same target interactions as the original IPS damage types PuncturePierce gains  against Ferrite and procs to reduce target damage etc. Furthermore ImpactPunctureSlash damage is weighted at x that of Elemental damage when deciding what type of proc to produce upon a successful Status proc.  This is largely because without additional weighting the IPS procs would quickly be marginalized by the number of Elemental procs.  Nowhere ingame is this information given to the player nor is the reasoning behind this decision readily understood by the playerbase.  I feel like the above change to IPS mods would solve this problem for those attempting to create IPS procs and therefore the additional weighting should not be necessary. ,Warframe,dco8clf,2,t5_2urg0

I have two options one simple one complex.Complex  Overload Mechanic If Critical builds are designed to provide burst damage and Status builds are designed to provide additional utility then Overload builds are designed to provide survivability.  The Overload effect will restore  of your missing Shields modified inversely by the Attack Speed of the weapon.  The base Overload Chance will equal  .    CriticalChance.    StatusChance.   Examples A weapon that has  Critical Chance and  Status Chance will have an Overload Chance of  .  ..  ..      . or  Overload Chance.  A weapon that has  Critical Chance and  Status Chance will have an Overload Chance of  .  ..  ..     . or  Overload ChanceA weapon that has  Critical Chance and  Status Chance will have an Overload Chance of  .  ..  ..     . or  Overload ChanceBase Damage mods can be converted to increase the Overload Chance Overload Effect or possibly both.  If only Chance or Effect is modified then DE might want to introduce a new set of mods to adjust the other variable.Other alternative effects for Overload were to restore Health only or restore Energy only or restore Health then Shields then Energy in that order.,Warframe,dco8e7u,3,t5_2urg0

Another problem is that his powers all do rad damage which a lot of enemies are either neutral or resistant to and at higher levels do to enemy HP scaling the rad proc becomes ineffective because enemies will barely hurt each other so as cc it isnt very useful his fourths only saving grace is that It blinds nearby enemies opening them for finishers his second is probably his most useful power but  armor buff isnt a lot until youre using high armor frames like Valkyr chroma and inaros. ,Warframe,dcr9pu1,2,t5_2urg0

10465636,0,t1_dcu97h8,I agree with your latter two points but for the first twoYou neglect the fact that in the grand scheme of things DPS is far from a reliable indicator of power. Otherwise the Lato would be actually good and not a steaming pile of vomit. Did you realize its lack of DPS after the fact?Also it seems that youre neglecting the new player experience here. You get saddled with either a peashooter or a handful of darts at the start. Coming from those two the Lex is a clear step up in quality with its shots easily making quick work of most mobs on the early planets. And it costing credits makes it a straightforward goal to gun for versus the other weapons that require farming for rare drops and then waiting a half day for it to build. And its ridiculous to assume a new tenno can get the prime versions easily unless its gifted to them.Its far from the best early weapon yes. But it is recommended nonetheless because it just worksTM  no need to tell them where to farm for this resource with no guarantee of dropping and no need to tell them to get these mods.

10577948,0,t1_dd6tl40, The Synoid Simulor absolutely trivializes content up until it hits a brick wall of not working.  This wall can be extended with Mirage because Mirage. But it still brick walls and it teaches you no skills relevant to anything else.  No skills at all really. Because the SS trivializes content and has a low skill cap theres a bunch of users who literally do not know how to play the game.  I am not exaggerating.  During one survival sortie we picked up a MirageSS user at least a dozen times.  Not a single other player went down.  He would legitimately go down multiple times to Scorches Heavy Gunners Ramparts etc. because the rest of us would target prioritize and dodge like when you hear the characteristic spinup noise and hed literally be standing alone in the middle of the room as the twin machine guns of death rained down on him.  Again and again.  He literally had no idea how to dodge damage because Synoid Simulor usually takes care of problems before you know theyre there.  With the right mods and forma the SS would probably take care of them in that mission as well  but there would still be a point where difficulty spikes enough that the Simulor just falls off.  And you wouldnt know how to play.  I am convinced half the Rampart whine in these forums is from Synoid Simulor users because Ramparts are one of the few things that the SS just doesnt do well against. It makes a noise like Satans bunghole and sucks up all the loot so you cant get it and . of users detonate their holes.,Warframe,dd7172v,13,t5_2urg0

10669541,0,t1_ddfk5ws,I mean thats fine and all but I got the impression that TWW was the beginning of the Tenno actually beginning to step into the role of true warriors. So this is what I think is going on.The Orokin use the Tenno as basically biological weapons. Under their rule and while fighting a war they create a warrior culture that had their own ruling body engineers artists and a code of honor as well as disciplines based around the focus schools.They then wiped out the Orokin and went into cryo sleep.They wake up with no memories of their past which is where we pick up but trusting the Lotus and our fellow Tenno we are guided through maintaining Balance by our enigmatic leader without really making any real decisions. Go Here blow this up capture this kill that dude. And we use our god like powers to do so.By the time you get to The Second Dream You realize everything is not as it seems and the Lotus has been keeping secrets. You find out you arent a nigh immortal god but instead a fragile child with no memory of their past that serves as a sort of battery consciousness to the frames.  Then we get to The War Within. Here we see that they are just children playing warrior through the warframes and not up to par with the warrior culture they once created under the oppressive rule of the Orokin. They then go through a right of passage through that quest being stripped of their warframes and forced to rely on their own abilities. By the end their personality has changed from petulent child to a warrior willing to fight to save a friend and put themselves in harms way rather than just completely relying on their frames. TLDR The Tenno forgot who they were that is why they act like stupid children. Through the quests we are seeing them remember and relearn the lessons that created their warrior culture and are beginning to reestablish it rather than just being child soldiers for the Lotus.,Warframe,ddghdhm,1,t5_2urg0

And i dont even play regular Conclave at all.This mode was honestly very fun and i hope they keep it around in some form.With all that said i honestly cant see any other reason for you being so hostile to this event other than not even trying to improve in it.

In normal gameplay sortie it matters very little if you kill an enemy in . sec or . sec. The video in my original post was meant to show Okina is perfectly alright in its DPS i.e. not a weak weapon. I know a lot of people love the fashionframe of the SaiDual Dagger weapons but are kinda put off by the bad reputation these weapons have. They should give Okina a chance.

Since riven mods work across the board on almost all weapon variants and each erapon has a designated disposition i dont see their brand of power creep being a problem.Power creep is expected in any game that continually adds content. Its how its handled that matters and DE handled rivens just fine. I actually think they went overboard in cases like the soma and tonkor being dropped to .  instead of being ..gt DE no longer wanting to fixremove mandatory modsThis gives no indication of that hell the argument can be made rivens do EXACTLY that.

Second if you have all the mods hitting those holes perfectly and not getting stuck on a lip is almost impossible. Correcting even more so. The main tilesets need facelifts to make them friendlier. Third we need more gametypes. The two that immediately spring to mind are a reach the center  mode similar to Rush but with some item that increases the timer and a Race mission where you race a ship by hitting boosters. But Im not picky.Fourth the mini map is atrocious for archwing. Thats because its a D map that flips around. You can accidentally turn your map upside down and backwards making it completely worthless. Please upgrade the map to D. Fifth getting the weapon parts is uninteresting.

10732352,0,t1_ddmwzty,Theres a few weapons and frames that cant be reacquired if you sell them so those will basically require that you reserve slots for them. Theres also a lot of weapons and frames that are extremely annoying to farm for so if you either want a complete collection long term or if you think you will use them again in the future they too will require slots of their own. Slots are some of the few things that cant be acquired without plat so theyre very much worth focusing your purchases on in the early game. Most people will also recommend never spending plat on frames and weapons since they can be acquired without spending it although some are as mentioned very tedious to acquire. Personally I tend to agree with the dont spend plat on frames and weapons since theres so many of them out there that youre bound to find multiple frames and weapons that you will enjoy using without having to buy the ones that you also want but cant get without lots of farming.,Warframe,ddmymw2,1,t5_2urg0

The system would be far more fair to all styles of play if collecting the Oro from the kill of another simply removed it instead of giving you points. I know for a fact that you are against players joining your server just to hide or not actually participate in battle for the sake of making it through the event. In my opinion spamming movement techs not actually killing anybody and only stealing Oro is just as destructive to the point of PvP as sitting there hiding or feeding Oro. Rewarding people for doing so is a bad idea and its part of the reason people continue to complain about PvP and treat it like garbage.Theres a reason I used the word relatively. Theres a mile of difference between hitting a fastmoving erratic target with a bulletprojectile and simply swinging a melee weapon in proximity to them. Whether or not I fall under the definition of your pretentious jargon is irrelevant.

10882237,0,t1_de2evcx,Maybe maybe not... whichever way you go about it youll find that most weapons and frames require the same few core mods and build diversity isnt really a thing until later in the game if you dont want to struggle. To that end maining a frame wont serve you any better than several frames unless you reeeeeeeeally want to master a particular frames mechanics. Modwise youll get there eventually... Also never upgrade a mod to more than rank  as a starting point. Its way too expensive for the benefits and rank  is really more of an endgame goal,Warframe,de2fbos,3,t5_2urg0

Also I did put them in  minute intervals.Third I find it to be one of the quickest ways to understand a concept without doing long missives and explanations that would diverge from a topic even further.Ive always said that of anyone else wants to do these feel free. My way is certainly more subjective given that I dont view it as a Devstream but Steve shooting the shit and explaining it from a dev perspective.I make every effort to ensure thats accurate and that people dont get the wrong impression from what I write.I just have fun with it as the rest is a way for me to unwind.,Warframe,de2o7gv,1,t5_2urg0
10885674,0,t1_de2hpmf,gtA fundamental principal of a free market is market liquidity which is the ability to buy amp sell assets without causing drastic price changes.That is an explanation of an observation we have of an aspect of the free market it is not a tennant which it is built on. In other words market liquidity or the illiquid nature of a product arise because of the free market the latter does not necessitate the former to exist.Riven mods specifically outside of certain variants such as veiled or objectively unusable in modern play are faily illiquid i would compare them to real estate in our market. gtTrade chat does not promote free market at all.  It absolutely does. gtWhen a system requires you to be on at the right time when someone just happens to be selling a riven and you just happen to catch it as the chat log starts deleting lines.Availability is a factor and a commodity just like in the real world. gtNot even close.   I really dont care what the solution is I brought up auction listings as a talking point to show how inefficient DEs solution is.  DEs is the best Ive found currently. Anything that puts the power of trading directly between players is better in my book.gtSome of the things that auction systems have are historical pricing and current pricing so that there is some basis in transaction prices. This is fairly easily done by lurking trade chat and using utilities such as warframe market which is a posting board for prices. All must be taken with a grain of salt ofcourse  gtStaying on topic OP is describing how we dont have that.   I dont agree at all trade chat allows for free market.  I think it allows for situations like OP described where they promote and upsell a riven above its real value.  Rivens dont have set values its whatever the seller wants to ask for. Whether the buyer agrees is a different matter.,Warframe,de2s2zx,1,t5_2urg0

It would give him Armor not damage reduction based on  of the total enemy armor in the pool or  flat whichever is higher.

10974061,0,t1_debkmbu,The Devs objections seem to be we dont want it to turn into Devil May Cry which is frankly one of the most baffling things they have ever said.First off as you pointed out two button melee systems have been used by many games with wildly varying levels of speed.  Theres no reason itd turn the game into DMC.Second and more importantly WHY NOT?  Devil May Cry is awesome and the rapid fluid combat is a perfect fit for floppy hypermobile space ninja.  Its such a bizarre stance.Combos as they exist currently are awful.  They arent reliable to execute in any way and clash horribly with the many ways the game has of changing your attack speed.Its not even like theyd have to throw the animations out keep the existing combo trees and just replace some of the pauseholdfaffabout inputs with the new heavy melee input.,Warframe,debx4l8,3,t5_2urg0

11009250,0,t3_5x5yrr,Please no.Theres already complaints about Euphona being a in weapon and this change only makes it even more clunky.As someone who plays games like TF I argue in favor of ondemand alt fire for guns like Euphona and Quanta instead of a toggle.Euphona has an altfire you need AT THAT EXACT MOMENT. If I see an enemy get up in my face Im not going to have time to press MMB and then line up my shot. I just want to point my gun at the offenders face and press MMB to blast them into oblivion. The secondary fires huge damage falloff also makes it very situational meaning you usually wont want to have it as your main firing mode.For weapons like Zarr and Stradavar it makes sense to have a toggle because the two firing modes are very distinct whereas for Euphona it needs to be on demand.Zarr has a toggle because if you go into a narrow area you wanna toggle to shotgun mode so you dont accidentally blow yourself up.Stradavar has a toggle because itd be absolutely stupid and unwieldy to hold down MMB for automatic fire.Your option for players to toggle is a fair compromise but it needs quite a bit of coding. Because . if its implemented badly AKA if you chose toggles ALL weapons get affected Quanta becomes clunky as fuck to use OR . Every weapon gets an individual toggle but thats a coding nightmare and bugs are bound to pop up.,Warframe,defv92z,2,t5_2urg0

11015474,0,t3_5xapyo,Okay here it goes.The easiest thing to do is recruit some people temporarily for the event. This will only allow you to get the tier one BP award and is a special exemption from normal rules. I understand not wanting to do this but this is the easiest way.Now for the harder way. I got  my first go pugging with two Vaubans a Trinity and a ugh nidus. Replacing Nidus with Trinity enables both vaubans to spam Bastille use the augment! like it its going out of style. Your other options are trinty loki switch teleport can be very important and two limbos with the haven augment. Keeps the dudes banished forever. If you do not want to pug then this may work. I had a glitched mission where the door to C would not unlock. However the dudes got to C drained it to  and then sat there for  minutes. If you stay far away from C apparently no infested spawn. Apparently the health drain stops when they stay near a life support pillar and only drains a fixed amount. This could enable you two to VaubanLimbo and Trinity only point B. It will take twice as long to do but you can duo it instead of relying on public matchmaking.Good luck.,Warframe,degkn21,1,t5_2urg0

11037714,0,t3_5xlklq,It takes practice. I play with several people who are seriously good at this game so Im always asking them to take screenshots of their builds and to send them to me. Best advice right now would be just that ask other people for builds and try to mimic them as best you can. Over time youll start to figure out how things work and then you can modify those builds to fit what works best for you.Each build is to achieve a specific purpose for example I build my weapons to do Corrosive damage. But Corrosive is less effective against Infested so I also have a Fire build option to switch to when I need it so think about a general goal to achieve with each piece of gear is it high slash damage? Crazy crit chancedamage? EXPLOSIONS!??! and build towards that.Formaing a piece of gear is also very helpful because when you max out your multipurpose mods as uBlissfulAltruism advised you having polarities that match each mod allows you to build a great piece of gear that can fit all of those expensive mods. Dont know what slotspolarities to choose? Ask for advice.Hope all my rambling made sense. Good luck. Side note I play a lot of Trinity so I have a tip for her build put nothing into power duration. Seriously. It seems counter intuitive but minimizing power duration means that her Energy Vampire ability pulses faster therefore generating more energy for your teammates faster.Edit Formatting decided not to do what I asked.,Warframe,dej3t7l,3,t5_2urg0

This is before desecrate procs which will reroll  of enemy drops. However since desecrate has a  chance to proc on enemy bodies this means on average  in  enemy bodies will end up becoming a health orb. Thats  health recovered for the cost of  if requiring  desecrate procs at  power efficiency before taking into account Arcane Pulse or Equilibrium. Not to mention Despoil and Equilibrium together negates the necessity for Arcane Energize. gtHealth conversion also is neat but just not really needed for any particular reason.The  additional armour from Health Conversion gives Nekros Prime a total net armour rating of  at  stacks of HC for a total Damage Reduction value of . net. This is before factoring in Shadows of the Dead. gtFor example your tank build is distinctly lacking in power strength and duration. It has  power strength which is all you need to get the maximum damage reduction from Shadows of . Additional duration would come at the expense of range which would hurt the viability of desecrate. Constitution is not really worth the mod slot here  duration really wont make or break the build. gtFor the tank build in particular you could have higher efficiencygtand your support build has lightning dash instead of something useful like power efficiency for some ungodly reason.Efficiency isnt a problem for me since I use arcanes.

Right now Augments wouldnt really be power creep as much as it would be a side grade for most frames. The odd man out here is Nekros as all of his augments are useful but not overpowered. Survival Mods well we might already be headed in that direction with the whole damage . deal. Damage mods might be relegated to their own slots because theyre seen as mandatory.

11238916,0,t1_df5vzlj,I didnt mean that it was hard to connect to raid school bus or similar communities.  Rather not everyone can host or properly lead a raid.  Even being in the community and experienced many players can find themselves waiting a long time for a group to form.  Its the same reason people hate mutagen samples in the derelict theyre keyed missions for which spontaneous matchmaking is impossible and group forming can be difficult.Id be happy with a longer reset time on being able to get rewards if it meant I was more likely to get a useful reward each time.  Honestly running the raids daily gets old fast considering its the EXACT same mission with the exact same map every time.  Many groups dont even check for rare crates anymore theyre so bored of it.  Most MMOs do weekly resets with more loot per run or at least token systems for loot.  Only the most hardcore MMO raiders expect to spend  or more hours a week in raids and they typical will do that in chunks over  nights.Very few MMOs keep their raids current and significant for longer than a year.  In fact a year is pushing it most of the time when it comes to a raid content cycle.  Warframes horizontal progression makes it a bit complicated but its not unreasonable to expect players to be utterly sick of a raid after  months and wanting something new to do.  The fact that its possible to get lesser arcanes from JV should be enough to show that DE originally had a progression scheme in mind before totally abandoning raiding in general.  If there was a long interesting raid progression greater than  raids with escalating rewards that were both predictable in terms of timeskill to achieve as well as necessary for progression maybe people would be more interested in raiding.  As it stands raids are easy and monotonous and the rewards are not only frustratingly elusive but also unnecessary for raid progression.  Even getting decked out in all the best raid rewards doesnt help you to complete the raids any faster or more easily.,Warframe,df5wxzq,1,t5_2urg0

THe grenades dont magically disappear they just wont detonate until youre out of range.. This leads to exactly the same i drop a nuke at my feet gameplay the tonkor has only instead of jumping because of the blast youll just fire straight down and then bullet jump up and avoid all that pesky aiming nonsense. On the other hand if they DO just poof when you attempt to detonate them too close you lose all of your damage on weapons like the castanas which is no bueno. Being a dingus and walking directly over your penta grenades as you detonate them which i still do sometimes whoops should be punishing because thats bad gameplay.,Warframe,dfclemj,3,t5_2urg0

The description on the forum is also different where it has no mention of dealing any damage at all.Maybe the description in game is outdated.

11341327,0,t1_dfh55ck,Its hilarious that people citing that shes OP are the ones blasting th notes. It just makes playing with you abhorrently annoying.Without being aware that nearly everything with her scales with frequency so you get the same end result anyway. Its most noticeable with her th notes display both faint and bright circles. Usually three faint followed by a bright. You can maybe get a buff going slightly quicker if you hit all your th notes and happen to land on a th note in the middle but with my playing Smoke on the Water I can get the same buff in the same amount of time with th notes because two of those are Bright circles with higher percentage modifiers for the progression of your buff. Plus with slower note timings its much easier to perform different actions rhythmically and receive multiple buffs.Smoke on the Water in your head Jump. Jump. Slide Bullet jump. Jump.

11363393,0,t3_6267ys,Id like to refer you to a video I made of an hour survival solo with Oberon watch?vAmeQAbncIn general he is a jackofalltrades master of none. Without comparing with other frames and looking at what Oberon offers he has a very wellrounded toolkit. He does well on the star chart but his damage falls off once you reach the level  mark. Thats when he truly shines as his abilities specially  and  give really good CC. Past a certain enemy level Oberons th becomes your bread and butter. It shuts down the affected area and blinds those that the ability does not reach during the initial cast. Oberons true strength is in his weapons with his CC providing additional backup. Outside of that he serves a very small niche in Radiation Sorties with his .He does better than most people assume. Oberon isnt regarded as well as others simply because of the comparative mindset that honestly needs to stop since others tend to do what he does but better. And that is a grave disservice to such a fantastic frame. He does need a rework but for what he is at the moment hes very serviceable. At the end it all depends on whether you like how Oberon performs. Build him and test it out and see if he fits your play style. Dont listen to others regarding whether he is good or bad that is subjective. ,Warframe,dfk0p0d,3,t5_2urg0

Frost I dont think needs a passive change his kit is perfect and works everywhere and the augments are pretty good. If he gets a strong passive DE might nerf him since only nullifiers can stop a frost and nullifiers recently got nerfed with an extra weak point and shrinking bubble based off terrain. Maybe add on cold proc to enemys who melee frost ontop of the already existing  freeze chance. Theres not a lot of room to buff him being King of defense and all.Definitely agree on that one.

11487016,0,t1_dfuk011,Hey!  Im terribly sorry for the late response but thank you so much for replying! These answers are basically exactly what I was looking for!  Your point about Ivara not being  terribly good at pointdefense type missions like mobile defense excavation etc is a good one.  The thing is in order to make this game more fun for me personally I occasionally pick a single frame for a day and try to do everything that needs to be done in game alerts syndicate missions etc.  That way Im forced to be creative with how I approach different missions and which weapons I choose to bring.  Thats why I was hoping for some advice on those types of missions even though it would probably be better to just switch to another frame.  If you dont mind though I have a few more follow up questions for you.  For things like the Soma and Tonkor would you say Heavy Caliber is necessary to truly optimize Ivaras Artemis damage?  Currently my Tonkor makes use of the Argon ScopeBladed Rounds package since I mostly use it with a jetstream Zephyr but post nerf Im not sure if thats even viable anymore.  I noticed you use Blind Rage in your more Artemisfocused builds for Ivara.  Is the hit to power efficiency noticeable?  Im not the biggest fan of using consumables in solo play just a personal preference and I dont care when in party play so Im wondering how bad the energy drain is using it.  Could Energy Conversion work in its place?  I figure that with Ivaras prowl giving a decent chance at finding energy orbs she could make decent use of it.,Warframe,dfy1vl6,1,t5_2urg0

11494682,0,t1_dfywgkp,gtYeah because enough is something that people care about in video games?As an MMO player Enough is perfectly acceptable unless youre going exceedingly balls deep and wanting to eke out that last  more DPS with the better gear.  And even in EVE people point fingers and laugh at people for losing ships that are worth nearly trillions of ISK to fleets that cost less than a billion ISK total to fit.  Just because you can doesnt mean you should and therefore good enough is perfectly fine in my book.gtPets look cool and its fun to take them with you on missions. If you are talking about the lack of Vacuum its not the pets fault in any way. Its DEs fault that we dont have pet Vacuums. And saying that they shouldnt be in the game doesnt make any sense. Why shouldnt they be in the game is there is zero negative sides? I bet some people like using pets even though they dont have Vacuums. That means they have some purpose and that means they should be in the game.Except the pets do nothing but run off and get killed in two shots and you have to risk your neck fighting to get to them or just let them rot because their AI fucking sucks.  Not to mention every purpose they have can be done with a sentinel and done far far better along with the fact that the sentinel wont run off and kill itself randomly.  Its not an argument of No universal vaccuum since I used Djinn and Shade almost exclusively its about them being a credit sink to maintain something that is more of a headache than a help.Also I cheered every time a Fomorian blew up a relay.

But at least say that you cant instead of saying that I didnt ask you anything.Because wed be here all night and I sure as CRAP dont have the time for that in between doing more important things also I tend to ramble on a lot. I asked you for a specific situation ANY situation to do in the sillycrumbs so I can make you a video to give you solid video evidence that your argument is like cheese full of holes and likely old hat.But to gloss over the details since you tried to censor my last postgt List a useful role that Mag isnt outclassed in.Damage. Shes only outclassed by frames that do potentially infinite damage as opposed to being in the ballpark of a mere shitzillion. But thats more than understandable since Infinity is a hard number to beat. Then again if you look at Frames like Loki or Frost you dont need damage to be a good frame.But Mag does the damage when in the right hands. If you cant personally do that that is not a problem with the frame.You still dont have a leg to stand on as far as Im concerned.gt List the interactions you mentioned earlier that break the game.I plead the th because the last time that happened Ash needed a rework. And not because of Mag and Ash that wasnt what I was implying before nor does that make any sense and also how did you come to that conclusion. Were talking about Bladestorm Ash and the build I made that proliferated and then he needed a rework. Keeping in mind Ash was considered trash at the time by everyone who was lazy as all hell until Sorties came out and people realized Ash does the damage. Keeping in mind between when I made the build When the first Rift Sigil was available to the when the build proliferated Sorties NOTHING ABOUT ASH CHANGED.Its almost like a zeitgeist can be unhealthy or something when misinformation dominats critical thinking or something.On that note do also keep in mind that I dont want people to hate me.gt List one time Mag has been needed for something since her rework.Copypastegtgt Magnetize broke Vay Hek he would instadie till they patched it same for Juggernauts especially when youre farming juggernauts Mag can lock down Sentients and turn their encounters into cakewalks with even shittier weapons Mag is a lot like Banshee in that due to her steroid she can make any weapon including shittier ones do phenomenal damage and is great for farming though I wouldnt say required etc etc etc.gtgtAnd its only a matter of time before the next operation that probably involves killing something. Taking a Mag couldnt necessarily hurt then I guess.To that end Im still waiting for you to give me a situation here. Because youve yet to still prove that you have anything back up your argument.

11590483,0,t3_65c1px,I feel like the damage cap would be more reasonable if it wasnt also affected by target armor or damage resistance and if nonDoT damage didnt also count towards the cap.Like if you cast Overload and it kills low level enemies immediately it was going to anyway. If you cast it and it draws itself out against high level enemies that also makes sense as a form of utility. Having it just be consistently timed across the board though so that it burns out in under  sec and grabbing a large group all at once accelerates that? Or that shooting someone can consume the cap on them before they receive damage from the ability itself? Doesnt make sense.Not to mention that charging his passive actually just takes a flat  damage off the cap.Like I understand that the devs dont want people to just throw on Power Duration and Range and just keep the entire map locked down forever. But the current version just has a fixed maximum Duration anyway.,Warframe,dg9sf8p,1,t5_2urg0

This means that team mates have to run around the entirety of the map constantly with nothing else to do. I understand it from the perspective of wanting to clear the waves fast as possible but when you are in the lower level maps for these with likely new players it just means the new player ends up questioning why they even bother... At least thats how I started feeling after having it happen for the th time when I started playing recently. There are some things that happen in public matches I kinda wish people would not do... Queueing as a  person pub team to run hr missions is another.. if you get some unlucky bastard to join and dont say anything to them theyll get  mins in and want to leave and then they either have to abandon what progress they made or be held captive till you all decide its time to go. ,Warframe,dgdo8t0,6,t5_2urg0

11775646,0,t1_dguj2m8,Okay Ill give you that one. Limbo is supersquishy so a lot of his combat boils down to Rift Walk hit and runs and Static Cataclysm shenanigans. The former is quite geardependant the latter less so.While decent at the hit and run I do find myself needing Static Cataclysms to remain relevant in a few mission types. Mostly Survival and to a lesser degree Defense.While theres something to be said about being prepared for any sort of team member it goes both ways. Limbos need to be more considerate and Tenno that depend on their primaries need to be able to work around Limbos.A fun fact? Your bullets resume flight when Stasis ends.

Hallowed Ground needs a better augment.  Im telling you DE just bandaid it up and make the augment a nonstatic Hallowed Ground.  Also perhaps some number tweaks.  And that its still really hard to see though they did address this. Renewal could be better if they increase the armour buff a bit.  That and perhaps lower the energy costs a tiny bit.  Also it the bleedout reduction doesnt affect downed allies which would be kinda nice to have but it isnt a requirement. Reckoning isnt that bad tbh.  Maybe armour reduction tweaks.  The augment would be nice if it spawned Hallowed Grounds on enemies that are affected  as well as working with the rest of his kit. His passive... its better than before I guess.

11801531,0,t1_dgxjxid,Just make sure to bring your Iron Skin. Gotta have protection for when you Rhino Charge in and make her Roar.,Warframe,dgxqt7a,14,t5_2urg0
11802629,0,t3_68da05,Should vacuum just be something every warframe has instead of making it a companion thing? Sounds more reasonable to me in the first place. Thoughts?,Warframe,dgxval9,5,t5_2urg0

11803863,0,t3_68da05,Pretty sure the need was communicated well and more than often enough at this point. Maybe we get vacuum at some point when DE adds another Rivenlike monstrosity to make the majority forget about whatever thatll be.,Warframe,dgy0bt9,2,t5_2urg0
11807934,0,t1_dgydcvt,Well there are certain things I am excited for. Like Tennogen new frames etc. But new systems new events and the like... Its generally been just new grinds for the past while. Even the Earth remaster is going to come with a new grind ambient bird that drops resources? What is it going to drop and what are we going to be farming it for?. So I have to keep my expectations in check.,Warframe,dgygxth,9,t5_2urg0
11808095,0,t3_68hef2,Ignis modding The Igniss base damage is Heat meaning you will always have one of the  following damage types Heat Gas Radiation or Blast.You could also add an additional element to the IgnisHeat  Corrosive or ViralGas  Magnetic or Cold or ElectricRadiation  Viral or Cold or ToxinBlast  Corrosive or Electric or ToxinNow with how pure elemental weapons work...the weapons element is always added LAST for making the combinations...so keep that in mind when youre building. Also unless a weapons base damage is already a secondary elemental type one made by using two other elements....take the Hema with its base Viral damage as an example you can only have two elemental damage types on a weapon at any time.    mods should basically be core to any Ignis build you make Serration Split Chamber and Heavy Caliber since HC doesnt hurt the weapon at all. You can also get a lot more DPS by using Vile Acceleration or Speed Trigger if you dont own VA although this will make the weapon burn  through ammo pun not intended.The weapon in general is rather ammohungry so Id recommend using Carrier with Ammo case alongside it. Personally Id go for the following damage combosEither MagneticHeat or RadiationCold for Corpus.Either CorrosiveHeat or pure Gas for Infested. Either CorrosiveHeat or RadiationViral for Grineer. Now to get into slightly more advanced Ignis modding Mod the Ignis Wraith for crit. Just trust me its a good idea.Use a pure heat build on Accelerant ember.Dont mod for status because statussecond is garbage.Gas Ignis is great with Saryn.Use FirestormShredSinister Reach for syndicate medallion hunting.  ,Warframe,dgyhlia,1,t5_2urg0
