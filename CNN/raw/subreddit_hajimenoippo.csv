679522,0,t1_cghhnk0,dont be so sure. Its ippo so hell probably shrug it off but that was a left hook that caught him while he was juking hard right. He literally dove into the hard left. Add in that it was a big swing and it is only normal that it dropped him. Any normal boxer would likely be out for the count. This is the first time weve seen Ippo take a serious blow when he wasnt tensed for it. Even when getting countered Ippo tenses his muscles almost immediately because he was so used getting counter punched. But this didnt hit him after throwing a punch it hit him mid juke.Add to the fact that no one saw it hit except maybe Takamura and Ippo will likely spend the next chapter down wondering wtF just hit him.,hajimenoippo,cghig84,8,t5_2tru3

Dude puts his heart on the line and barely loses undergoing insane character development and really going down a new and brilliantly done depressing path for the series.... Only for him to come back immediately and start acting like a retard again joking with Aoki and shit completely ruining his character development and cementing the major problem with his character for the rest of the show.I just wish that AokiMura would just fucking keep their serious character development that they occasionally get and not go back to being dumbfucks within a chapter afterwards,hajimenoippo,d4as2dh,1,t5_2tru3

8068482,0,t3_4pnld0,In the long term there is probably a potential for another season but I dont think it will happen in anytime soon like with in the next  years.  I think in general series isnt popular enough or makes a lot of money to okay additional anime for it.  I think a big reason why Berserk is able to get reboots is because it is pretty popular world wide.  Even the manga is selling pretty well.   Where as Hajime no Ippo doesnt really have that.After all the series isnt that popular worldwide since the massive amount of volumes tend to discourage some readers.   volumes is a lot to read.  Not to mention boxing isnt that interesting to some people.   I know quite a few people tend to ignore sports theme mangaanime because they dont think it will be good.So the series is sort of handicapped a little at trying to become popular.   I would love the series to get another series or a few movies made since there is a lot of great fights that have yet to be animated.   Right now it is only animated up to volume ish.   ,hajimenoippo,d4mz27n,2,t5_2tru3

8217188,0,t3_4ro1dd,Takamura needs to just run his way through the other weight classes to show how much of a monster he truly is. Because it is said that he is fighting at a handicap due to weight management against Hawk and Eagle. If he goes to his natural weight class he should hopefully adjust quickly and demolish his opponents without the weight management handicap. That is for the sake of consistency for me.But I think it should be revealed that the final heavyweight he fights is ranked PP and Takamura is . That is a worthy fight for him to be the best of the best. ,hajimenoippo,d54pcjh,1,t5_2tru3

It might not be immediate but years down the line I could see someone in the crew going blind If not Takamora. Boxing has been proving to have long lasting effects for those with long careers and based on how realistic For the most part that this series is.

Willpower is literally all you have at that point and it can carry you very far. And this isnt exclusive to boxing. Theres a reason why paramedics keep anyone with a serious head injury awake. Speaking from personal experience will power plays a big part in this too.

Randy Boy would also be a good match but there really isnt any history between the two like there was with Miyata.Ippo vs Imai since Imai looks dangerous and has been wanting to fight Ippo. I think Imai would win in a slugfest.Takamura vs SuperMiddleweight preferably one like Carl Froch who fights almost identically to Takamura. Aoki vs Prince since that was what was implied to happen. Dont know how hell beat his speed though.Kimura vs somebody he can WIN against not draw for the fourth damn time already. Come on. Jeez Mori if you hate Kimura that much just end his suffering already.Sendo vs Miyata or Alfredo if Alfredo has already faced Ricardo. Sendo beats Miyata in order to face Alf. Sendo then beats Alf but would most likely lose to Ricardo. Sendo may also showcase a new Smash.

I would go so far and say that from a skill standpoint Ippo would do very well in a world title match. All his muscles are well trained he got rid of his weaknesses and his finishing move is about to reach a new final? form.I think Ricardo realized this back then in the sparring match that when the Dempsey is developed hes going to be very tough. Gonzalez also saw Ippos potential that he would give Ricardo a good fight but also his current biggest weakness His mentality.The mentality is what keeps Ippo back. Ive opened up another thread about that. I think this is the last big obstacle before Ippos world conquer begins. Of course he still has to keep refining amp polishing his skills there will be plenty of training. At least thats my interpretation.,hajimenoippo,dfkgvwi,16,t5_2tru3

That being said Alfredo is still ranked  and Ippo almost beat him. He even downed him.

11378564,0,t1_dfgzq5x,i swear i must have skipped dozens of pages of the keiichi fight. sarcasm onoh look ippo somehow forgets a lot of his fundamentals to give Take the upper hand and show that he is experienced. whats this? ippo the pure infighter spends the majority of the match reacting like a counter puncher instead of dashing in under his opponent like his usual strategy? it would give him near immunity from clinches tackles and southpaw but why use your usual strategy in a title match. inconsistency? no way. its just Keiichis experience.they say ippo have no experience with opponents lower than him. apparently shimabukuro got erased from existance all of a sudden. i wasnt notified.  oh goodie another whole page and a half dedicated to showing Take looking at his son wanting to make him proud and his son looking back worried. whats that like the th time now totally not sick of him trying to impress his whinny bitch of a son.and then they try to have a moment after the match to show that his son was proud despite him losing. because he is totally likable and need a happy ending after throwing every dirty trick minus  against our likable protagonist.sarcasm offmostly i totally fucking hate his son. those reaction shots really kills the flow of the match for me. and out of everyone the son should understand the most why his dad walked away from the Date match. instead he whines people call you a coward. are you scared of the strong champion? why did you walk away? to help keep you alive you ungrateful cunt.overall the keiichi fight will always be my most hated fight but i still think Woli is the worst written character in the series. my favorite part of the match near the end where Take got his face smashed repeatedly into unconsciousness. skip all the Im doing this for my son dialogue for best enjoyment. and when that journalist lady say he will die to the dempsey the grin on my face was bigger than the jokers.,hajimenoippo,dflqox9,1,t5_2tru3

They werent using any headgear and both went full throttle.That said unless its a winner gets to fight Ricardo match I really see no point in another match between them. As dangerous as Sendo is its still already  for Ippo.Even then Id prefer monster Ippo fights Alf to get his right to challenge Ricardo since Alf deserves to feel what its like to fight a full powered Ippo and not the mess he was during their match.Things like sendo beats Ricardo and then Ippo fights Sendo for the belt would be a terrible idea since Ricardo has been portrayed as this invincible juggernaut we have yet to see anyone even injure him in a match while Sendo stands at  losses to Ippo and only gained his belt because the judges were biased to foreigners and refused to give it to Volg.,hajimenoippo,dg1778i,1,t5_2tru3
