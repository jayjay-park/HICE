5835027,0,t3_3uq7ua,You cant use a card in more than one deck. If you are trying to use a card you only have one of in both decks you cant register both decks. This shouldnt affect your missions but they may have made a change. Just go into your deck and verify that you have  cards in there.,MabinogiDuel,cxkhyxr,2,t5_37l0t

6104348,0,t1_cyjg5d9,I still dont see much problem. Initial concern was whether or not you can stand up to the meta. You can. But now its about whether its cooler and stuff. I am not going much into that territory but in my opinion its cooler when you beat people with all these fancy cards using your most basic deck. My friend told me theres someone in KR who reached top rankings using just the beginner dark deck. I consider that cooler. I saw a video in youtube that beat a guy with like Orperia Dark  Magician Masked Field using just Holiday tournament cards slimeinnwell. That is cooler.,MabinogiDuel,cyji32b,1,t5_37l0t

7897458,0,t3_4nfj46,Valuable resource! Everyone keep in mind that the meta changes really quickly. If you use a deck from here and it doesnt quite work ask someone who is more experienced or try switching just  or  cards. Experiment until you can see which card is the problem and then replace it appropriately. Sometimes a deck just needs a minor tweak to remain viable in a changing meta. This is general advice btw  not about these specific decks. All decks are vulnerable to a changing meta ,MabinogiDuel,d43qxkn,3,t5_37l0t

8314222,0,t3_4taevf,Surprisingly I got the same one yesterday from super booster. Went to the shop and found someone selling it for m then I realized its actually you  I found it an amazing card when it finally managed to deal damage to your opponent it will took like  resource with it! That will just shut the enemy down. I know it will disappear right after but the enemy can kill it with resource spell anyway. Its a huge loss compared to the normal Sher who deal damage to other creatureits sher theres usually no other creature! or HermitSherr who heals again your creature dont need healing most of the time. I do love to get the light version though since i run light a lot,MabinogiDuel,d5gu1hj,1,t5_37l0t

8574964,0,t1_d6d8759,Hey thanks for the detailed response to the video  always nice to get constructive criticism ampnbsp.  A great idea... I just need to figure out how to do it P This is my first time making videos... Ill work at it and edit the video when I figure it out!. I thought about that but the price changes fluctuate so rapidly that any estimate I gave would be wildly innacurate within two weeks..  There seems to be a lot of support for a WS video so thats definitely been added to the list! I had intended to do it for this Monday but the recent Arena patch may mean that I cant get the video done until the next Monday... although I may release it on Wednesday as a Bonus Video.. Haha Barbarian would have been a perfectly good drop too  I tend to play extremely defensively until I see an opening and then strike hard. Different playstyles . Eagle is hit or miss with the AI  when I fight it sometimes it messes me up and sometimes its a wasted drop. But its a decent card and easy for newbies to get so I figure its fine. There are way better cards  like the prenerf Dragons Guardian you mentioned  but unfortunately I didnt think most of them counted as budget   If you think of a better card than Eagle let me know!ampnbspWeekly content is proving to be no problem to do fortunately so Ill keep on at that. If I find myself with extra time I may even start making bonus videos and doing the ocassional Twitch Stream and then your deck can make an appearance   but well see how it goes ,MabinogiDuel,d6dgbs9,1,t5_37l0t

Always nice to see new faces ampnbspId really like to have a sticky thread for friend sharing but unfortunately reddit only allows two sticky threads at one time and were using them for the Trading Megathread and Weekly Card Discussion  I could perhaps put a link in the sidebar to the current Friend Exchange thread?ampnbspFeel free to add me ingame by the way.

9110201,0,t3_54yzet,It will be hard to disguise your deckwith  squirrels it will be called infinite squirrel deck. Most good players will have a Doppelganger or good removal waiting to counter I would suggest black knight to protect them or run mana so you can have a counter spell.,MabinogiDuel,d86wdc3,1,t5_37l0t
9207203,0,t1_d8j1nr7,My pleasure  Im glad it helped a little ampnbspThe Mutant cards you listed arent great unfortunately but your collection will grow quite quickly and youll have decent ones in no time. Noricore and Dantruger are about equal in terms of usefulness so try them both out and see which one you like best. Build to your playstyle.ampnbspAs for the best way to acquire cards I have a couple videos on the subject actually  This one on general tips and tricks what to prioritise and what card boosters to pick up. And this one on how to make gold quickly in the game so you can buy cards from the Player Store.ampnbspIf you cant view those videos  or just dont want to  then the short version is that you should be doing the Daily and Draft Missions every day for the Gems and doing PvP Arena up to Gold youre guaranteed of hitting Gold as you get points even when you lose for both the Gems and the DailyDraft Mutant Booster Coupons. Then look in the store and see what Mutants are currently available There are four packs of each  daily and draft  that cycle out every two hours over the course of  hours. Wait until you see a good mutant then use your Coupons and Gems to try and grab it.ampnbspOnce you start getting duplicates of good cards put them up on your Store and use the gold from that to buy specific cards youre looking for from the Player Store. If youre ever confused or unsure as to what is a good or bad Mutant or any card really just ask around here  everyone will be happy to tell you whats good and what prices you should be looking for.ampnbspHmm another wall of text... sorry! Hope it helps. Good luck! ,MabinogiDuel,d8j2y66,1,t5_37l0t
9325196,0,t1_d8u88lc,I agree I dont think youd be able to sell him for more than . Sorry he is a worse than average mutant version there really is hardly any use for this card that I can think of.  times out of  youd just be better using a common  or  resource card instead of a boro . ,MabinogiDuel,d8y1crf,1,t5_37l0t
