6587597,0,t3_45sz7j,Ill nominate Housebound UK and US Netflix. Its more comedy than horror and has some proper belly laughs. Probably my favourite movie from Frightfest . My second one is Rubber US Netflix I honestly cant remember if you covered it in the Mondo Movie podcasts. Im sure youve already watched it but on the off chance a B movie shot in the style of David Lynch about a serial killer tyre.,streampunk,d00pm92,1,t5_3cj3i
6993971,0,t3_4bghc3,Jessica Jones was really impressive in how little it exploits rape for titillation. We are all genre fans we all know what it is like when a movie throws in a violent sex scene to get its audience blood pumping. JJ impressed me by never turning the Purple Man into a male power fantasy such as showing him surrounded by scantly clad mind controlled women. I was out sick so I was able to shotgun DD season  and it is the best thing they have put out so far in that it has multiple stories and does not feel as stretched out as season  or Jessica Jones. That said I feel like Bojack is one of the best things netflix has given us. Also I recommend the Hulu show Deadbeat. It is basically what you get if you cross the Sixth Sense and Always Sunny in Philadelphia... a childish thirty something loser who helps ghosts move on so he can score a little weed money. It is dumb and offensive but consistently funny. ,streampunk,d193y4q,1,t5_3cj3i
7281414,0,t3_48ncbd,You havent mentioned the most obvious answers which would be the many adaptations of FRANKENSTEIN and DRACULA. The former confronts the issue of the privacy of God and when the man who stumbles on the secret to the creation of life he creates an imperfect abomination that is best destroyed. In the latter a man of science must confront the reality of a creature of ancient lore.One I just saw today that I enjoyed a great deal is THE DOCTOR AND THE DEVILS about a th century anatomist who needs fresh bodies but the church will only permit him to dissect criminals since theyre hell bound anyway. This leads a couple of unsporting fellows to kill people to sell them to the anatomist.Happy viewing!,streampunk,d25ujqw,1,t5_3cj3i
