You also might want to remove some of the ones that dont really say anything about you. It kind of looks like you googled skills for resume and copy and pasted. no one is an expert at that many things. You should be able to show these skills in your explanation of your previous jobs and education. Also no one is going to read a  page resume. You should have a cover letter a one page resume that could function on its own and possibly a second page if you feel that there is relevant information that really doesnt fit on the first page. The professional profile section should also be taken out. Anything that you think is important should be covered in your cover letter.

241949,0,t1_cf5rr7n,Okay great  thanks. Some initial pointers on the resume as it exists at the moment. Im just going to run with my thoughts as I call them so please excuse any errors or judgements that I make based off of that. Though bear in mind recruiters may make similar judgements. Personal Profilegt My whole life is surrounded by technologyEveryone is surrounded by technology. It invades our lives constantly. By having a non impacting opening line like this in your resume I would automatically assume that youre young  with little experience. Disappointingly youre now in the no pile. A personal profile should be a teaser a taster a preview of whats to come when I continue reading your CV. It should make me want to read it and want to offer you an interview from the outset. Try to tailor your personal profile a little to the role that you are applying for. For example you could begin with I am an applied computer sciences graduate with xxx experience in blah blah blah... Use the rest of the profile to highlight some of your career or educational achievements ensuring that these are somewhat relevant to the role that you are applying for. Sell yourself. Your CV is a marketing tool where the product is you. Have a go at writing something today  pick a role that youre interested in and write a few lines.  or  sentences max. Education and qualificationsTry putting these reverse chronologically with the most recent and most relevant qualification being on top. Work experience I agree with the previous comment about removing the reason for leaving. For most people this is irrelevant. Again remember that with certain roles most people know what you have to do so try to stay away from listing your jobs duties and concentrate more on quantifiable and relevant achievements. Perhaps in your McDonalds role you consistently beat KPIs or targets that were set. Maybe you decreased costs by X. That sort of thing. You dont need to drag on with these achievements but make sure that they are somewhat related to what youre applying for. Perhaps when youre writing it again for the first time list a whole bunch of achievements and removeamend those when applying for roles. Note Remember that a lot of skills from both your work experience and education are transferrable. You may not be able to see how working at McDonalds gears you up for working at a top tech firm  but there certainly are. CharacteristicsWhilst these are all great theyre pretty generic. Either remove this or try to think of some more personal ones or at least hit a thesaurus and exchange them for some ridiculous corporate buzzwords. Skills Great. Move this above Characteristics. Perhaps add a level intermediate expert etc. in there. HobbiesYeah get rid of that. So next steps. Perhaps find a role that you find interesting and rewrite your CV based on some of the advice above and see how professional it feels in comparison to the last. When you feel comfortable with that lets have another chat and see where we can go from there.  Note Spelling and grammar errors in resume. Whilst I know you only wrote it in to remove the name of your college ensure that you spell it college rather than collAge. There may be others but that one shone out to me.  Hope that helped a little... REedit layout etc. ,resumes,cf5tw3d,2,t5_2r0bv

So that could put you ahead of other newish grads that might be applying for the same jobs?I really prefer the use of bullets to delineate each line of activity.Youre using the semicolon incorrectly.

304527,0,t1_cfca9kw,Do whatever you think works best for you. The point is that there is no perfect format for everyone and you need to just think about your knowledge and skills and how you can best present that information.My opinion is still that a one page resume unless you have  years of experience is the best way to go. Lengthy accomplishments and the kind of detail you may be talking about would probably be best placed in the cover letter as well as brought up in an interview. A resume isnt the best place for too much detail. Its a skeleton of who you are and what youve done. Its succinct and should display the information to the reader in an organized and quick way. For most people including myself and most recruiters in the United States at least for the majority of job sectors one page is sufficient.If you have two pages no one is going to just throw it in the trash but if you have one page those small details that you have left off are something that you can discuss elsewhere during the job process.,resumes,cfcbxyk,1,t5_2r0bv

1022061,0,t3_25ryig,I usually advise my clients against using relevant coursework.  Employers have a pretty good idea of your coursework based on your degree so its rarely useful to start spitting out a list of all your classes.I also think the activities section is inappropriate in todays resume and shows youve clearly run out of things to say.However project experience is an excellent idea especially in the fields of engineering and software development.  Show them independent projects as well!  Any evidence that you created something should be presented on your resume.  Employers understand you dont have a lot of work experience right now so if you can show them projects where you worked on an app a game etc they are going to treat that as ability.Source I am a professional resume writer and career coach at www.ExecutiveDrafts.com ,resumes,chkgr19,1,t5_2r0bv

1168723,0,t1_ci13kgr,Hey thereAt first glance I didnt even think this was a resume. I thought it was your cover letter.  Its just not really styled like a resume its incredibly short and looks scribbled together.  The unfair part is Im sure you took plenty of time to do this but writing a resume without a template is needlessly difficult.  Find yourself a good template and go from there.You also need a summary at the top I believe all entrylevel graduates should have a summary.  Write a couple of sentences that summarize your qualifications as a great employee.Also if youre proficient in Java you need to show me a portfolio.  If youre a java badass we can throw this whole resume away and you can go make k a year coding Java.  If youre not good enough for that you may not want to casually toss proficiency around.  You should delete your subjects from this resume as well.  No hiring manager is going to care what subjects you took in an associates degree.Look I know the struggle here.  You have very little work experience and an associates degree.  So theres not much to tell.

If you really want to include that summary line not necessary IMO change it from summary to objective since that is technically what the statement is. Your skills section is full of generalizations and should be cut down and bulleted. It is a paragraph of incomplete sentences and not easier to read.

Any sort of computer position expects basic understanding of productivity and email clients. Not sure what type of job you are looking for but I would see the software section and toss out your resume. My advice determine the job you are looking for then tailor the resume to that job. e.g. looking for a job in entry level IT support for network and hardware play up the networking and A stuff. Drop the items that dont deal with that job like web design and graphic design.

Your bachelors should be the top not the university Remove that Richard Hale school unless you feel it is absolutely required that you post it. I have no clue what possessed you to post your courses AND put the fact that you got Ds and Cs. Leave off all the courses. Just put June  for your graduation or whatever it was. What is Grade ? I cant tell where youre from. Your computer skills are good ut be more specific  Word ? ? Photoshop ? CS ? What is CES? Why is Microsoft only in front of Word and not the others? Change your Relevant Course Modules to Relevant Abilities.  List your projects just as if they were work but make a Projects subheading.  Post your role in the group what class   school you did that in then use bullet points for your accomplishments in the project. Include the MMYY for beginning and end of the project.

2206312,0,t3_2kd28g,Howdy! I took a look at your resume and have a few pointers for you. Take out Your Future PM BRMP. Im not sure if you really have that on your resume or if its just there to protect your anonymity. But you should put your name there instead with the contact info underneath like you. Your professional summary which by the way should be labeled as such is too long. For example theres no need to mention your certifications because you cover that later on. I would try to get this down to  sentences your st sentence is good I would probably leave it at that to be honest. Your skills summary looks great! I like how you organized your skills into  categories its much easier on the eyes. Change Career Progression to Professional Experience. This area needs a lot of reorganization because this is the meat of your resume see bullet points below!. Use two lines to write the basics company titlelocation on  line job titleduration of job on the next one. Also I recommend including months and years  is very vague as that could be any amount of time from  months to  years. Its immediately a bit suspicious as it makes me think maybe youre trying to hide gaps in between employment? It looks a lot stronger if you include months. BULLET POINTS ARE YOUR FRIEND!! Avoid writing complete sentences at all costs. Each position you list should include  bullet points. Start each bullet point with an action verb. Dont just list your job rolesresponsibilities tell them what you accomplished. Quantify your achievements as much as possible the bit you wrote about the budgets you oversaw was excellent in this regard!. Im not really sure why you listed a bunch of software you have experience when you have a separate skills section above? Also any time you have a separate section like the blue boxes label it. I have a feeling your projects and highlights sections will end up merging in your professional experience section. Its going to be a lot cleaner and easier to read that way. Change Credentials to Certifications. Change Will be certified ... by November  to PMI Certified Project Management Professional PMP in progress November . Or Expected November . Also certifications are huge in IT Id move this section to the very top in between your professional summary and skills sections. Trust me you want employers to immediately see that youre very close to getting your PMP cert theyre going to love that! No education section? Even if you dont have a college degree which is often forgivable in IT depending on the position you should list the highest completed level of education GED? Some college? etc.. Definitely keep it at the end but I would definitely include it.Thats it for now! The good news is you certainly seem to have a solid background on paper anyway. The bad news is that was not immediately clear to me because of the way your resume is currently organized. Thats okay though! Youll get there and Im more than happy to help you along the way.Let me know if you have any other questions!,resumes,clk9y1c,2,t5_2r0bv

Shink all font to  point and increase some fonts bigger headings and such maybe  point depending. . Points  are to cut the page size down big time tops  pages. Id remove the lines going across and save on that space. Keep the headers there bold and increase to  point font for differentiation.. Right align the dates.. My preference is to see anything not current in the past tense.. Condense some points and expand if possible. for example your volunteer experience at Friends. a. bullets  and  can be combined. b. bullet  can be expanded upon. What types of tasks?. As important as your volunteerism is scale back the amount of bullets. Similar to the last point I made but you need to save on space.  bullets max.  . Change Work Experience to Professional Experience  Within this section include and condense your shadowing experience.. Professional Experience goes first then educational. . Condense section of Honors Awards and other Achievements into the Education Experience. Move each bullet to its appropriate educational slot. . Remove hobbies and languages. .

I need all the help I can get to make sure Im doing things the right way.  So please if theres anything I can do to improve and become better I want to know.  Im very businesslike when it comes to feedback and just want to make sure Im the type of employee you guys want to hire fulltime.Youd be surprised how powerful a statement that can be in a world full of subversive and subtle communication.  Everyone likes to beat around the bush in business so Im the one who is very earnest and straight forward.  It makes them want to give you a chance and gets them rooting for you.  I always kept a pretty close pulse on how my managers felt about me.  Maybe I was needy maybe I was paranoid but it certainly worked!The best thing you can do is clearly understand expectations of your job understand which parts of the job are priority and make people feel comfortable being honest with you dont get your feelings hurt dont retaliate etc.  I learned some of this info through trial and error so I hope it helps you minimize the amount of lessons you have to learn!,resumes,cr3pxa8,1,t5_2r0bv

4023232,0,t3_36af3x,Yes there is no general format. However there are generally better ways to create a format than others. The only thing I would say is universal is that you need to customize your resume with the job posting. It is so easy to pick out a generic resume. If you have a qualification that is posted on the job posting you need to make sure it is in your resume and that it is easy to see. I do like your layout. Cut out the hobbies section. I dont care if you like board games or not its not relevant to your professional career. I would say the work history is the real section that needs improvement. You need to work on your job descriptions. These should be achievements you have had at each job. Generally it starts with an action verb followed by what you did and the outcome. ,resumes,crevn7s,1,t5_2r0bv

4505356,0,t3_3cpxe6,This isnt a risky resume designits standardexpected when applying for creative work especially in noncorporate settings.Speaking as a graphic designer and someone who hires graphic designers theres absolutely nothing wrong with being a freelancer. If anything it shows that you can manage your time well deal with the most difficult of clients and get shit done......assuming thats reflected in your portfolio.Designwise Id change a few things Dont include your picture. Doing so will automatically disqualify you from some jobs mostly in bigger corporations and government due to unconscious or conscious biases. Emphasize your portfolio URL. Simply list your other interests. Right now its just clutter that eats up too much space and draws the eye away from more relevant information. You need to expand on your educationexperience. Dont just list what you studied or who you worked for talk about what you did. Your methodology for the information design of the skills section is flawed. The design is visually interpreted as a percentage scale not a time scale and the user will assume youre talking about proficiency. Do you really know absolutely everything there is to know about Photoshop? Dreamweaver? Probably not. Instead of showing your years spent using the programs which is super vague show your selfperceived level of proficiencycomfort with the software.As always for creative work your portfolio is far more important than your resume.

You can could probably include phrases such as accuartley controlled to obtain whatever percent samples within this and this error range. Something that shows the employer you accomplished something with this particular job. this can be elaborated for all of your other  academic experiences as well as your work experience.  Take out the related skills section. Its irrelevant instead you can describe these skills in your job descriptions. Such as used Mat lab to do this this. Used Microsoft office for this this. Managed time at this job by doing such and such. Showcase yourself by telling them how awesome you are Put a rough range for a season. Instead of Fall put September to December again to follow through with your formatting for your related job experience  You can take out jobs that are irrelevant to the position that you are applying for such as volunteer unless you can somehow related the experience and achievement gained from the experience to the job you are applying for.Thanks all!

I have extensive resume editing experience.  professional experience needs to go chronologically with the most recent coming first so instead of  to  it needs to go  to   Dont put an objective sentence just for the sake of filling up space. It should be a short sentence. If anything you are seeking a summer internship in the field of computer science. Or you want to gain more experience in computer science this would be more for on campus jobs  needs more detail  Unless requested perhaps consider removing your GPA since its low  It feels like you are putting random whitespace to compensate for lack of things to put on your resume  Yes projects projects projects. Expand from thinking about personal projects to class projects. What major code have you written for class? Even if it was just an end of semester assignment you can still list this. If you have big code projects for game botting think of something to name your project. If asked about it be ready to explain. You dont have to say everything. I really cant imagine though that you have gone through  years of school without class projects. Even my freshman year Intro to C class had an openended class project at the end.   What have you done in college? Its not really jumping off the page here. I assume you have been involved in clubs or something? If not what about some internet things you might do? Contribute to any open source projects?   Dont list your course numbers  they do not mean anything to someone thats not at your school. You can list relevant coursework and put the actual names of courses feel free to abbreviate or shorten long names to get to the point. Dont list classes you havent taken yet. Most of this stuff will be covered when they get your transcript.  In general a CS major should not have to say they are good at Interneting and Microsoft WordExcelPP. Especially not as the first thing in technical skills. It really makes it sound like you dont have marketable CS skills and by the time youre a junior I would assume you must. Break up your technical skills into these categories for now  Operating Systems  Programming  Software. For software list significant things that might be relevant could be as simple as emacs matlab etc. Programming  feel free to list major OO languages like C as well as small scripting languages like Perl or bash  Your professional experience needs bullets and action verbs google resume action verbs. You need to be saying what your responsibilities were at these jobs. You need to understand that even though a maintenance department job is not CS related you may have developed other skills  such as leadership did you supervise anyone? good self or time management problem solving. Think about what marketable job skills you got from all of your jobs in your life without the context of CS. Its true an employer might not care that you can clip a lawn but maybe you needed to use time management maybe you drew up landscaping plans handled the money side of the business accounting skills communicated with clients maybe it was your own business and you coordinated this all yourself. Again do not think oh well this is not CS so theres nothing to say here. You have other skills to highlight in this area with bullet points.  General guidelines these days say not to add interests at the bottom.  Join the ACM acm.org. Its cheap for a student membership. Then you can put it on your resume too.

Also I want to let you know that Resume writing is very opinionated and dont believe anyone if they said they know the absolute BEST format because there isnt one like that. Now to real feedback Too long not hard and fast rule but I think you can consolidate the same content you have with a better structure Too Scattered you are just outlining a list of your dutiesstuff you know from the job but not necessarily telling clearly what your impact was. The logos google adwords is the first thing I saw followed by your resume title Technical.... something if that is the impact you are hoping the reader to walk away with then you did good there however be careful with logos they will not be parsed properly when you apply online via ATS. Subcategories of your speciality in each job is good for you to separate but instead of presenting that way on the resume come up with a  line summary for each of your job which tells the reader what you did and what your main responsibilities are where you can use these subcategories as your responsibilities.

6042257,0,t1_cybi6kn,Woo! Makeover! This is  better. NowFit it on one page. You can easily change the margins here to do that. Most american engg grad resumes are  page. Canadian are . But they are both full pages. Never have white space.Why two phone numbers? This can get confusing. I would just put one in especially if you have voicemail.An expected completion date cant be in the past. Just say the date no explanation necessary.Once youve graduated uni college is generally not that important but i think here including a Bajan college if you are looking for jobs in Barbados is a smart move to give yourself some local recognition.If you are applying outside of Barbados you will want to change the job locations to City Country. Are these all in Barbados? I remember Arawak from Trinidad. Upon googling it appears to operate in both locations. Confusing for me especially when I wondered if it was a typo for St Lucia lol.This is probably very cultural but in USCanada its common to make all work experience descriptors start with an action word similar to what youve done for your houseman but in past tense. I would also like you to expand on some of your short points. Ideally each point should be just shy of one line to fill white space and control the flow. For example the bottling internship could begt Implemented cost reduction measures that saved a projected monthIf you can explain not only the intention of saving money but the RESULT of saving money... Gold. People will eat that up. If you dont know? Educated guessing is okay.gt performed regular maintenance on the bottling machineryYou want to show that you are hands on and know how to use tools and fix things. Many engineers are just book smart.The third line is really just redundant of the first two now I think... Unless you were making design modifications to the plant then thats something you should draw attention to. Okay now that Ive googled accumulation table... I thought it was going to be a data tablegt designed new accumulation table for collecting bottles before packaging.gtgt Created detailed CAD drawings in Solidworks for manufacturing?You can extrapolate this to other areas. From here it should be ready to impress. Good luck.,resumes,cybne1d,2,t5_2r0bv
6146379,0,t3_3zq3r2, is better but still can use some improvement. Summary is a useless section. Pull it. Experience should come first then ProjectsExtracurriculars then education. Your bullet points are good but a little vague. Use the extra space from pulling the summary to add more info. You can save space by adding your titles to your section item headers. e.g Instead of having a bullet point of Served as Treasurer you can add the title of treasurer to the left or right of United Nation Associate. In fact its probably better to do a  column approach using the title organization dates for your  columns. IMO the block of colour behind your name might be hit or miss. Your choice but I would consider restyling it a tad. Again nitpicking but maybe consider sorting your skills and certs section into  bolded points since theyre overflowing onto a nd line.

6413980,0,t3_43hbl7,Thats probably the best draft of an SE resume I have seen from a student. Very good.Some thoughtsEducation If you end up needing room for other stuff in later revisions the name of your courses should be the first thing to go. Comp sci course titles are not very informative. For example I had  classes with the word algorithms in the title they ranged from being intro courses to grad level courses and if you didnt take the same coursework you wouldnt know which were which eg your Logic and Algorithms could easily be either a senior level course or a freshman level course and only someone who attended your university would know which it is. The only time I would say you really really want to list a course is if it is very directly and obviously related to the job youre applying for.SkillsIf I was looking at your resume for hiring I would probably suspect youre being a little generous with your skills section. Be sure that if I were to ask you questions regarding any of the things listed there that you could produce a strong answer.Having git and github both on there seems redundant since github is an application of git. A better solution might be to include git and put a url for your github somewhere. Most places probably wont take the time to look at your github bit it doesnt hurt to have.When applying for internships that dont involve game development or d modeling I would suggest simply ommitting the game development row. Projects As a student the projects section is the most important part of your resume. Your degree is basically a checkbox your grades are basically a threshold below x GPA theyll probably just ignore your resume and the titles of classes in your course load is almost meaningless but your projects can demonstrate what you can do and how you can do it  Projects are things that both management and engineers can talk with you about meaningfully.You really should include more projects even if the code that implemented them is long gone by now. You might have to shorten other parts of your resume to maintain your very nice brevity. Be sure that someone with no technical background can understand what each project is and that someone with the appropriate technical knowledge could understand how you did each project.A perfectly valid detail to include about projects is your development process eg Agile waterfall ect and the sort of teamwork it took to make happen. We work in an industry where being able to work with people very effectively is a marketable skill.Work ExperienceGenerally the advice for students who havent had professional careers yet is if it isnt a job in this field we dont care about it with the possible exception of your most recent job which might be the only evidence that you can actually hold down a job. Youre a bit different since you have professional experience already but I would still think about maybe ditching the older job. It doesnt seem relevant to SE even if it might indicate that youre probably a pretty smart person. If you could use the space created by removing that job to list more projects it would probably be in your favor.OverallI think the brevity is great and your organization as also good. As an engineer Im a bit biased towards listing projects above skills because I consider that to be more a more valid representation of what you can contribute and it makes for a more interesting and robust interview topic than quizzing you on programming languages but having skills first might be the wiser choice for getting your resume past HR and management with s and into the hands of an actual engineer.Youre entering this field at a good time so I dont doubt that youll have no trouble finding an internship and then a job. Be sure to vet your potential employers as hard as theyre going to vet you to make sure you end up in the sort of environment you want. The atmosphere changes a lot from company to company. If you like to work ballstothewallshard make sure that you end up at a company that respects and rewards that rather than a company that would like to maintain a relaxed atmosphere. If youd rather have a more relaxed atmosphere make sure you arent applying somewhere that expects you to work at a grueling pace  hours a week.Also since with your grades and qualifications youll be in a reasonably good position to choose your employment Id suggest applying for jobs where your work will be the companys profit center. You will be treated much better that way. Eg If you are hired as a software engineer at a company whos primary product is adhesives they will wish they didnt have to hire someone to do your job. If youre hired at a company whos primary product is software for companies who make adhesive then nobody will want to get rid of your job because you are what makes them money.,resumes,czipdif,3,t5_2r0bv
6419098,0,t3_43lkzo, The formatting needs a lot of improvement. The text stretches all the way from the left of the page to the right. Consider making a column either on the left just for section headers or on the right just for dates. It will break up the page a bit and be easier to read. Maybe its because you took the name of the college out but the formatting on that very first line looks nuts. Why is that one line left justified when nothing else is? The bullets are too wordy in a lot of places. For ex nd job bullet  could be   Coordinated services projects for atrisk youth including managing  participants each month and supervising two schoolwide service days for local schools. Another example is job  bullet  amp  which could be combined into something about managing orders troubleshooting issues amp processing returns. Govt internship Do you really want to highlight that your advocacy campaign was fax amp postcard? Just leave those words out. While Im sure it was quaint it sounds super outdated. The two bullets for your film crew job sound incredibly inflated. Id combine those two bullets to just say something about developing great customer service through your rolls in concession and ushering. If you need to save space as you reorganize the formatting you could consider removing your oldest student job. its not like you dont have solid professional experience since then and that one isnt adding much professionally. Something is weird with the fontsize for the headers. It looks like your company names are more prominent than the section headers with their sizing amp font. It should be reversed. Skills section You dont need to say computer as if youre dividing your skills into multiple types because you only list one type. If youd like you could rename the section to Technical Skills.What kind of jobs are you looking for? Education? Office management?

6808645,0,t1_d0nytxf,You should definitely link to your GitHub and create a Projects section to highlight your projects. Each languageframework you list under your skills should generally have a reference somewhere in your projects section. If you are applying for a developer position recruiters arent really going to care about your previous work experience as they are all unrelated. I would trim down your experiences cut some out keep them to one short point etc and dedicate more space to showcasing your technical abilities. I would also put your Projects and Skills above your Experience section as like the other commenter mentioned a recruiter probably is going to stop before they even get to the bottom with the current layout.With Udacity CodeAcademy etc they generally walk you through the course step by step so they dont really hold that much value to be honest. If you want you can mention them in your summary ie. Selftaught programmer via edX Udacity CodeAcademy...I used to do tech recruiting and I wouldnt really say that someone with an economics background has any more of an advantage than someone else with an unrelated degree. Either way you guys are all likely selftaught and it really comes down to showing them you can actually program.

6869828,0,t3_48o2la,The following is opinion based on things Ive heard. Im no pro.Whats happening on the second page? Is it worth reading? A friend that works in HR once told me to imagine youre an HR type with a stack of  or so resumes. Theres no telling where yours is in the stack or how much attention span the HR type will have once they get to yours.Now my girlfriend lists EVERYTHING shes ever done on her resume. It comes out to two plus pages. She can do that because her resume reads like someones employment bucket list.Also chronological resumes suck. Who cares if you filled for the regional manager of Krusty Burger while she was on maternity leave while waiting for a teaching job in China to start? Add a footnote that you can provide a complete listing of all jobs worked upon request. Unless its exciting AND relevant cut it. Instead think of it as a news article not a resume. Ever read a newspaper news article news or sports not features or opinions to the end? Maybe but not usually and not if youre in a hurry. All the boring stuff gets put at the end and editors cut from the bottom if they need to make something fit. If the stuff is really good they keep all that they can and trim other stories. If it isnt interesting enough and another story your educationcredentialsvolunteer work is more compelling then they cut it to allow for the others.,resumes,d0v08fh,1,t5_2r0bv

Its also easier to mislead people using a functional resume which is a big reason so many of the recruiters I know reject them.I own a resume writing and career coaching company and we probably do one functional resume for every  or so clients.

8800749,0,t3_50oo57,Ive recruited for almost  years and I write resumes professionally as well. Id definitely mention US Citizen right at the top if you have any concerns about your name  it takes that potential objection off the table immediately. This resume looks like a mess. The underlines and those arrows are just distracting from the content. The dates written up the side margin  not a good idea. A simple format would be better. As for the content itself the summary is a bit fluffy but overall not terrible.The student newspaper job should be under education and include much less detail than you have. Those  bullets should be probably reduced to a single sentence. That value proposition line  Id lose that entirely.You dont have a skills section. It might help you to add one and you could include some of the tech skills as well as some mention of the soft skills.,resumes,d75qawt,1,t5_2r0bv
8801392,0,t3_50p26z,Ive recruited software engineers for almost  years and also write resumes and this is actually pretty good for a new grad. The biggest issue is that its thin. You dont show much experience and not a ton of accomplishments on the internship. Thats not so much a problem with the resume as it is with your background. No projects to mention even just academic projects? No GitHub or code to show? Might even be worth mentioning in the summary that you have internship experience at a YCbacked startup  that might get more attention right away as people might assume those are more selective than other companies.,resumes,d75t35a,2,t5_2r0bv
8802305,0,t3_50od1l,Instead of trying to phrase responsibilities particularly all responsibilities try narrowing your focus to a set number of key or outstanding accomplishments which occurred within those responsibilities.  Use this structure Accomplished X by doing YFor example in one of my previous positions my responsibility was taking incoming tech support calls and escalations.  Which makes folding clothes seem awesome trust me.Framed differently though Delivered technical support by acting as firstline and escalation point of contact.  Thats better much less passive.  It sounds like I actually did something.Then spice it up Delivered subjectmatter expertise through firstline support and escalation management.  Much more interesting active and dynamic.It can take a bit of thinking to get started but once you get the hang of framing her responsibilities in that accomplished x by doing y structure it should really help make the content of her resume feel a lot more interesting and help generate some callbacks.Much luck!,resumes,d75x1b9,1,t5_2r0bv

9755245,0,t3_5ew0zw,Definitely dont add an objective those are very outdated and pretty useless. A short summary is fine but also unnecessary in most cases.You also need to work on formatting  create an education section that includes a few of those most relevant courses under that section. Make that section into columns so you dont waste so much space on the right side of the page. Also include the Deans list accomplishments here. Do the same with the technical skills  columns will be better and move those to the bottom. Experience is going to be much more relevant than a list of program you can manage. Id work on ranking the most important bullets under your experience too. Training employees is going to be much more valuable than sorting glass right? Then it should go above that. It feels like you can flesh out some more specific accomplishments and trainings from both these jobs. Thatll be a much better use of space than a summary or objective will be.ETA People often freak out way too much about computers scanning resumes for key words. Very few companies rely on that software to sort through applications so thats nothing to be concerned with. Focus on adding the skills you have into your job experience its not a keyword concern its making sure you highlight what youre good at in plain and common language and youll make it through any companies that DO use that software anyways.,resumes,dafjwat,1,t5_2r0bv

10031021,0,t3_5j9a7j,. I wouldnt post your address and name on the internet. I am not sure if thats your real name or not but given your username its a sensible securitypersonal safety precaution.. Your resume should list your most recent position first and work backwards in chronological order. . Your summary is pretty good here. This is a matter of personal preference but I like summaries to be written in full sentence form so it reads more like an introduction than a laundry list. Maybe consider rewording a bit.. People generally do not put References available on request any more. Most understand that if I need references I can ask.. Once you incorporate these changes we can revisit it to see what we can do to minimize your spotty job history which isnt even that bad. I would also maybe not tell anyone about the drug problem right up front. I think drug addiction and medical leave are considered questions employers are not allowed to ask anyway but that might differ in your state.Hope this helps and good luck on your recovery.,resumes,dbf2hzn,1,t5_2r0bv

10299628,0,t3_5nh2ox,Just some quick advice coming from a hiring manager a lot of the terms you are using for your skills show that youre a doer and its not accurately showing that youre an achiever.Too many of your job descriptions are taskbased and not resultsbased. This means that they tell what you did instead of what you achieved.Using terms like maintain or meets deadlines doesnt stand out on paper as one who is capable of taking lead on projects or managing assignments.If I were you I would use strong actions words to better portray your skill set. I would also remove some of the simplernon vital skills that add no compelling evidence of your potential to employers like detail oriented or the ability to work alone or a part of teamI also was a little confused on your layout as the flow seems a little backwards to me. Typically you would want to see the most recent experience first following through to older experience.Overall there isnt much that makes the resume stand out from the stack of many others out there.

I had it on there just to see what people thought and to avoid death by bullet point. But I can add job description or break up some experience into another job title as a possibility. And I had the Hollister job in there so it wasnt like all I had done was military work but in hind sight it probably isnt relevant and I should just flush out the relevant experience from my military time.

10400389,0,t3_5oxtzj,A sixmonth job can be both fulltime and freelance. I think it is better to write that it was a freelance project. First of all you will be honest in your resume and this is quite important. You will also eliminate all kinds of questions about quitting the job after only  months. Not many companies want to lose employees after half a year everyone is searching for stable and reliable workers. I dont see any problem in indicating that the project was freelance work. It makes sense to treat it like a normal job in your resume but still it can be beneficial for you to show that you are a freelancer  this demonstrates kind of entrepreneurial attitude and good time management and organizational skills.,resumes,dcmy8lq,1,t5_2r0bv

10454622,0,t1_dct4ctb,Yep Its hard for me to give advice here because I am australian and I can assume our cover letters resumes are culturally different.Here for example with every skill you list in your cover letter you want to back it up with an example. I.e you mention you are a closer so here I would say in company x i achieved the highest close rate amongst peers for  months running for example   which exemplifies your skill as a salesperson. Which you have done for trust pilot.also I dont know if you guys use selection criteria but my cover letters generally follow the selection criteria followed with examples. If Ability to build rapport with customers is one you want to note you have been regularly appraised for your ability to build strong long lasting relationships with customers.If grinding is sales jargon then thats cool  im not in sales.otherwise its decent yeah.

10542283,0,t3_5qx5pg,There are many parts of this resume that are too cluttered or just strike me as odd choices listing psychology  for example is a real headscratcher.  Not everyone needs to hire a resume writer but there are pretty good reasons for you to hire one. First youve tried to write your own resume but did not succeed. Second youre spending a lot of time sending out applications but since youre starting from a poor resume youre wasting time.  Lastly I think your instincts are off a bit no problem my instincts are off about all kinds of things! when it comes to writing a resume.  And theres really no reason to rely on instincts. You can either go out and learn everything you need by reading articles and figuring out common threads or you can hire someone to do it for you.

10553539,0,t3_5r1dx3,Oh man. Is there any way you could go to your schools career center to get some help? You have a ton of useless info. At this point in time in your career you should have a  page resume.  pages or CVs should be used for research positions or expat jobs.Remove sophomore junior and probably senior design projects. Since you have some actual work experience internships etc you use those as talking points in interviews instead.Your MBA and GPA should be near the top as well as your degree title and school. Your objective is kind of useless obviously you want to get a job that you are interested in. Id look into a personal statement instead or removing it completely. The line underneath your name makes it sound like you think super highly of your FE score. If you didnt pass... you would probably just take it again. It is not something to brag about immediately. In my opinion it comes off as if you are already going to exaggerate your skills. Thats a horrible start for you. As someone else mentioned resumes that get to an actual person only make it to my eyes for about s max. Put a passing FE score under skills or in some other sections.Ultimately this resume needs a ton of work I looked primarily at the revised one. Id highly recommend going to a resume workshop at your universitys career center. Try to aim for an engineering specific one  or ask other engineering friends for assistance.Good luck!,resumes,dd4d23k,3,t5_2r0bv

I tended to work on things the rest of the lab was afraid of. I conducted experiments that could have killed people if I messed up worked with exotic crystal growth techniques worked at temperatures from .K learned welding and learned how to work in a machine shop.

So its not taboo to use a fancier template? I was always under the impression it would get you thrown out yikes! The software that we used for the Tallapoosa Darter project was built specifically for the project it was all sort of crazy we used a mash of DNA Subway Redline GenBank and a program that was engineered out of Apollo by a local University. ...how did I miss that. How did the people I showed it to miss that. Im pretty ashamed what the heck. principals!! oh my god. Thank you!

Thats okay  no respectable company should be asking you to divulge trade secrets in such a manner. Your true side projects or work examples can exist on the platform and provide corroboration of your skills and abilities. The resume in this sense will provide the reason for the hiring manager to look further at your repo to determine if you can back up what you are describing with evidence. I can all but guarantee that they wont be looking at every single project or expecting to see fully fleshed out programs  but they should be able to quickly ascertain that you arent merely making things up or using buzz words.

Anybody can and will say how great their communication and soft skills are. The reader will assume you can communicate until you prove otherwise and the fact that you used the words familiar and excellent repeatedly over a short passage of the resume leads me to believe you arent as excellent a communicator as you advertise. Excellent communicators wouldnt be so redundant with words. But more importantly dont hedge on all your skills. Just list them separated by commas and drop the soft skills. I dont see a GitHub link.

Not only is this out of your control but the way you talk about your job is very important.  Heres an example of awful and good narrative.Awful  Yeah My dad and aunt own a soccer store and I used to work there during the summer or whenever I needed the work. Id stock things and help out with sales and just do whatever was needed.Good  I worked at the family business by starting at the very bottom learning the basics of customer service and inventory.  But as I acquired more skills both on the job and in college I was able to contribute quite a bit more on the business side.  At this point my core functions are marketing and logistics where I oversee  and  processes.  Its a great company and Im very proud of what I was able to accomplish there but my heart is set on a career in Health Care and I hope to apply many of the skills I learned along the way.In other words dont hide from the family business nature but otherwise treat it like a legitimate career.

What you have right now wont get you an interview. Theres a lot in the FAQ about that or use the search and search for Software resumePersonally Id list your website link at the top next to contact info email phone website url in one line using dots or dashes. Right align dates of your projects. I like that you put links to the projects in it but I feel you could better explain why you built them and not just how.

Without some unifying opening statement all we see is writing retail marketing  what does this person want to do? So you write a summary and that creates the lens through which the rest of the content is viewed. If you tell us you are seeking economic and marketingdata analyst roles right away that lets us read the rest of the resume with context. The pharmacy tech and Nike job are pretty much noise on the resume  they arent advancing your candidacy at all and they are taking up valuable space. They distract the reader. Im not sure if removing them entirely or minimizing them is the answer Id have to see the resume without them but Im leaning towards eliminating them entirely since the number of combined months is less than that internship which is far more valuable.I expect if you make some of these changes youll actually perform much better. I might even suggest moving that skills section to below the education since those two things are stronger than the work experience.Good luck.,resumes,dgrtjk2,1,t5_2r0bv
