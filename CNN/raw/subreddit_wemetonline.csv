80355,0,t3_1uz1lu,Sorry things didnt work out bro.As for advice I wouldnt really suggest being friends. A good way to test this in your mind is to ask yourself how long would it take for me to be okay with her kissingdatingsleeping withmarrying some other guy?Im not going to say you cant be friends but being on the receiving end of a break up that happened just because of distance can leave a lot of whatifs and lingering feelings.,wemetonline,cenksll,1,t5_2svz3
198894,0,t3_1wdwg0,My exSO long distance looked way different in person! I was still attracted to him but I didnt expect him to look the way he did. My current SO looks exactly like I pictured him which made me nervous because I was hoping he would be less cute in person really to make me feel better about myself. Luckily we were still very attracted to one another and everything worked out.Dont worry too much. Even if your SO looks different youll still have an idea of what he will look like. He cant be an ENTIRELY different person if youve already seen him on skype. Just be confident in yourself and know that he is who he is.,wemetonline,cf13h82,3,t5_2svz3
216972,0,t3_1wkbpo,Im gonna unfortunately disagree with the other commenters. Things really can change between now and then so this isnt definite but I would say shes almost definitely not interested right now. If by valentines day she still hesitates to admit she likes you youd be forcing the relationship too quickly. If you do this you could lose her entirely. Dont let the romance of Valentines Day cloud your reasoning and risk it. LDRs are not for everyone. Its possible she could warm up to the idea with time but until she does I think suggesting something so unattractive to her right now would just put a crack in your relationship.Im not saying give up. But I wouldnt set Valentines Day as the deadline when right now she seems pretty opposed. Just let it flow naturally. You dont need a special date. The date will become special when it happens. You could still do something for her on VDay though like send her flowers. Actually by doing that you could start to show her how distance doesnt mean you cant make each other feel perfectly loved. Best of luck either way!,wemetonline,cf35ori,7,t5_2svz3

I texted called IMd but had no way outside of that to contact him at that point.  I figured he was bored of me or something along those lines but I still sent him a text or two every day just hoping...Turned out he had the swine flu!  He was sick in bed for a week barely able to move his dad had to help him to the bathroom even much less pick up his phone or sit at his computer.  He was so apologetic when he came back and even showed me his hospital papers in case I didnt want to believe him although I did anyway and Ive heard the tale many times from his parents since.If he had a bad headache Friday theres a chance your sweety might just be sick in bed.  Give him a few more days and try to leave communication open on your end by sending a sweet text a couple times a day.  ,wemetonline,cfgzkpi,4,t5_2svz3

1397006,0,t3_2a3keg,No no you are not too young at all!I am turning  in a month or two and I met my boyfriend when he was  and we began dating when he had just turned . Hes now turning  fairly soon and were still together However you need to consider a few things first. Ive seen from the comments youve only been talking to her for a few days. Take things SLOOOOOOW. I didnt consider a relationship with my boyfriend until I knew him for about maybe  months and we didnt get together officially until about half a year passed by talking every single day. And we didnt get to even meet in person until yet another year passed by. It was SO HARD and its even harder waiting to see him again when there is no super clear date. Seriously I fucking hate life right now.Secondly a LDR generally means youre in it for the long haul. Youre gonna move in together and have a life with each other or nothing. And at  thats a pretty ridiculous thought to have. So you need to be okay with letting go if thats what needs to happen. If theres no clear end date in sight and the relationship wears on you its time to let go.Good luck.,wemetonline,cire93b,1,t5_2svz3

3275507,0,t1_cozsvt0,Thanks for your reply and youre right I dont want anything to do with someone who sees me as a nd option. Im not sure why this happens to me with guys. Its happened twice in real life and now online. They always show interest first sometimes theyre even aggressive about it then when I start paying them attention and we actually get talking they reply less and less and disappear because theyve found someone else. Really dont get it but cant deny that its a huge blow to my already poor selfesteem. I just dont feel all that worthy of a relationship. Maybe they can all see that Im not good enough that Im missing something. Maybe Im not pretty smart or funny enough. I dunno.gt I wish more people would just be upfront with not wanting to continue dating X person. I feel the same. If there was a legit reason they lost interest in me and it was something I could work on I would. But they never explain. They just leave.Im a workoholic I run a small business and have bad social anxiety so Im naturally isolated from my peers. I wont find friends or a potential partner by burying myself deeper into my work. That will only assure that Ill be alone my whole life. Im  and never dated Ive been lonely and depressed for a long time but tried to remain optimistic. I thought it was only a matter of putting myself out there but I guess it isnt. I really wanted to try new things this year and meet new people. I wanted this year to be different.I erased my POF and will never rejoin.

3556819,1,t1_cpwemdx,Yeah I thought I know him well apparently no. Am I bossy in real life? I dont think I like to be in charge but sometimes you just have to be. Its more like a leadership thing. Also hes super patient to me and he tolerates so he normally wouldnt fight back or say anything bad to me more of focusing on resolving the issue when I freak out.What do I think he could do better? Learn to deal with life and how to actually treat a girl. Hes great tells me I am beautiful and etc. BUt I think I expect more from him like to hold door offer to carry my stuff and so on I KNOW THATS A LOT TO EXPECT. I AM A PRINCESS sick. Also I expected him to be more protective to me like woah big guy even though him treating me equal is good too. Fuck it I still cant decide if I want to be treated equally or spoiled protectedWhat is romantic to me? You know how those korean drama scenes that make you roll eyes? Yeah thats but not realistic so meh and I didnt expect him to be romantic because after talking to him for  years hes not a romantic person IMO.

Sorry I dont have a better suggestion there but know you are not alone.  If that is the only thing keeping you guys from moving forward in the relationship at least here in the US it is super common to be in that kind of debt sadly.  I really wish it were different.

4580749,0,t3_3do8f7,Yeah I think youre overreacting and being clingy. Hes taking a onceinalifetime trip to Europe. Let him enjoy himself. It isnt his job to be your crutch you should be able to stand on your own two feet. He can be there to help support you thats what people in relationships do but what youre doing right now isnt healthy. Youre codependent on him and you need to break away from that. For reference I have not taken a trip away from my SO but I have taken a trip away from my mom whom Im extremely close to. I went to Australia to meet my SO in person last year. I thought that I would want to call or email my mom every day because Id never been to a foreign country before and Id never been on a huge trip without her but I wound up only callingemailing once every few days. I was enjoying myself I was busy and the time difference was a factor too. See if you can arrange something like he calls you every few days to check in. That way it takes the pressure off of him and it gives you something to look forward to.Just my two cents.,wemetonline,ct809gr,3,t5_2svz3

7700182,0,t3_4kd0vc,My nowfiance and I met on Omegle still makes me chuckle inside. It was nothing special to begin with from there we just started talking about video games we both liked and for a while she thought I was either gay or a girl. After we talked for two hours or so we exchanged contact info to text later at the time I was on a classic iPod Touch using a free app so its a miracle I was able to exit the browser and enter again to give my info. We talked for a few months and after we had some hard talks about exs and current situations we both realized we cared more about each other than just friends.About a year and a half of LDR later she was in Hawaii I was in Arizona so travel was really pricey she moved to a close university and I went up to visit ASAP for the weekend. That was the best couple of days of my life she was perfectly imperfect and nothing was better than finally being together after nearly two years. Fast forward a few more years weve had to go through some more long distance stuff since she had to move again after college but now were looking for a permanent place to live we recently got engaged when she came to my college graduation. A lot has happened in our time together some wonderful things and some tough things but regardless Im happy Ive been able to spend every moment with her.,wemetonline,d3hgkgv,3,t5_2svz3

7911229,0,t1_d45a3l6,Absolutely not because one Im emotionally competent enough to understand my feelings and communicate them effectively. I dont think thats an accurate analogy either. You are canvassing the internet with the same story and getting it seems roughly the same advice. And what are you doing with your advice? Nothing. You just post it again and again and obsess over the last message she sent you. Is this just your reality now? Is this what you see yourself doing a month from now? If she wanted to talk to you shed talk to you  why is that hard to understand? Trying to get more from her than what she wants to give is selfish. And Ive seen you blame it on everything  the fact shes pretty the fact that shes dating a frat president the fact that shes in college. But it might be the fact that you arent who she wants to be with anymore. If she wanted to be with you she could just as easily try to close the distance and join you where you are. But she doesnt. Shes living and enjoying her life  a life that sounds like you probably wont be a part of again. You can make yourself miserable over that forever or you could move on. ,wemetonline,d45ap4b,3,t5_2svz3

8403269,0,t3_4u3dmr,Hi! Okay you might have read a post of mine a few days back. Im m UK involved with a f USA and like you weve only known each other just over  weeks. And were  miles apart so HA! Beatcha! ahem moving swiftly on...So our situation seems really comparable. If you want context on my situation read my post from a few days ago so ill write here assuming youve read it cos I think youll relate to what I wrote.How long was it before you started including xs talking about the future and such? Because for me it sounds like youre rushing into things and falling for the fantasy and the dreamworld moving too quickly to properly consider perspective. Speaking as the older guy I consider your guy to be rather irresponsible discussing families and such at all let alone so soon with someone with your age and lack of experience. He really should have been more cautious about encouraging that considering he has more life experience.I bit more about my situation that I didnt say in the post her and I basically in a relationship now and for the past week ive really felt like I wanted to tell her I love her and...we did just that a couple nights ago. Thats...significant for me. Trust me when I say that I dont doubt that your attraction to him and him to you is legit I get that. I too have an incredible connection with her to the extent I genuinely dont know whether such a connection and level of communication could happen so quickly in an offline i.e. typical relationship. We ourselves have discussed brief plans of when we can meet were thinking this time next year if she comes to tour Europe with me or I go to USA. Its scary im not going to lie but it is worth it as far as i see. For both of those reasons Ive not got involved with her lightly at all. Again I am someone in a different life stage to her and she too is inexperienced in relationships. The last thing I want to do is hurt her or take her some place I should have seen was bad. Im being very very careful.So my biggest piece of advice would be to slow down. In fact id actually say backtrack. And communicate. I cannot emphasise this enough. It sounds like you two have it but it can always be improved. Trust and knowing where you stand is vital in these types of relationships. And if you two are seriously considering meeting I would recommend cutting out the fantasising about kids and family life. Think would you discuss kids with someone from home that youve only known for a couple of months? If the answer is no then apply that here. If the answer is yes...then I think you have to reflect on why that is most likely not the best option for you and that you need to live a little learn about the world and understand yourself before you think about bringing a new life into being. Im really hope this didnt come across as abrasive but I feel being blunt helps here.Let me know what your response is to what Ive said here well figure it out yeah?,wemetonline,d5rydm1,2,t5_2svz3
9846424,0,t3_5g7qro,Are you two officially dating or just have romantic interests in each other? If youre dating you two should talk about things with trust and respect instead of jealousy and anger. Everything is about communication trust her and her actions until proven otherwise and everything will be okay!  ,wemetonline,dar0fs5,3,t5_2svz3
