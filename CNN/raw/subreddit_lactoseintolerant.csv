857380,0,t1_ch1okfg,Another vote for the Lactaid. While the nonlactoseintolerant members of my family drink regular milk we use Lactaid in everything else from sauces to hot drinks to desserts.,lactoseintolerant,ch1qm8o,2,t5_2semk
1824180,0,t1_ck8gql4,gtYou may have days where lactose is no issue and days where it is if the intolerance is mild.Im glad to hear this is the case for other people. Sometimes I get epic pains and other times I just fart a couple of times.,lactoseintolerant,ck90530,2,t5_2semk
1876019,0,t3_2g2cb0,This sounds exactly like how mine started. I stopped eating breakfast because I felt sick in the mornings and milk used to make me feel sick but I just thought it was because I didnt like the taste. Then yoghurts started to give me a reaction and eventually ice cream and chocolate... at least I eat healthier now! A lot of pills contain lactose so watch out for that probably wont affect you much but when I started taking birth control pill everyday my intolerance got worse because of having extra lactose everyday.,lactoseintolerant,ckf94to,1,t5_2semk
2681923,0,t1_cn8mm2n,Thanks for the suggestion!  According to the store website there isnt anywhere to buy that around here Texas but Ill check the store freezer sections for it just in case.I was wondering about Cool Whip since I thought it was dairy free but then I read the ingredients before buying and Im glad that I did.  I didnt realize the recipe changed somewhere along the line.,lactoseintolerant,cn8nbvh,1,t5_2semk
3406416,0,t3_2z7m37,Short answer no. Youre going to be LI forever. However go see a doctor to rule out any other issues first. Long answer you can mitigate symptoms with lactase pills and avoidance diet. As far as pizza is concerned though I think youre shit outta luck. Sorry. ,lactoseintolerant,cpgk1j6,2,t5_2semk

5000225,0,t1_cui2lgf,I just commented about how Ive had these and theyre so tasty but that I still get lactose intolerance symptoms after eating them. This must be why... which is such a bummer. Ive stayed away from Cabot cheese since the last time I had it youd think I had drank a glass of milk it was so bad. I wish this was more reliable so I could have cheese without fear ,lactoseintolerant,cuopqcu,1,t5_2semk
6237561,0,t3_3w4k5x,Before I totally gave up dairy the lactase tablets only lessened the effect of the lactose for me. Things that were fairly light on dairy I could get away with but if it was really high fat content or if it was something that was entirely comprised of dairy like a scoop of ice cream glass of milk mozzarella slices etc.... NOPE. The effects of the lactose werent as bad as they would be otherwise but I still had to avoid the big things. ,lactoseintolerant,cyyn5y5,1,t5_2semk

9933376,0,t1_db2avs4,They do list all the ingredients. Yes theres the lactase but theres a section for other ingredients. What brand do you use? I know lactaid has that stuff plus cvs Walmart rite aid target  if youre familiar with these brands. Theres also holland and Barrett I believe its called and theres similar pills to those in the U.S. probably made by the same company. These from what I can tell have the least amount of additives and seem to be the best if youre worried about reactions to them however you need to take about  pills for it to reach  lactaid pill  FCC which is just way too much. Plus people normally dont just take one lactaid they take like .. so the equivalent of two lactaid pills would be like  of the other pills. Why can things just be simple? ,lactoseintolerant,db2ceav,1,t5_2semk
10908537,0,t1_de4rgem,I know the feelings you are having. However for me I constant nausea every day. I couldnt really pin this down and neither could my doctors as my symptoms were very random.The tipping point for me was when I go violently ill tmi but I mean vomiting twice within a week of each other and the only thing I had similar was dairy. At that point I stopped eating dairy completely to see if it truly was that. After about a few days I began feeling so much better. After about a week or two I felt like a whole new person. I felt like who I used to feel like it was amazing.I must say you must just cut the dairy out now and see if it truly is the dairy that is the problem. Because if you dont feel better it could potentially be celiacs or gluten intolerance. I am not a doctor but you dont want to risk this being the case because if gluten is your problem then continuing to eat gluten can cause irreversible problems. I am not trying to scare you but rather saying even if you are not ready to give up dairy at least try it for a week or two and see if your symptoms change. If not then I suggest going to see a gastrointestinal doctor. ,lactoseintolerant,de54zk8,2,t5_2semk
