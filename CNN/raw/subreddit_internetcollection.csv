2670790,0,t3_2qljwt,Wattage EraAround late  we got our most beloved dead sysop Wattage. That article explains it better than I can here but Wattage came in during the hilarious Cyndre and Lilo episodes and would go on to ruin many vloggers. YouTube is best when its copyright infringing though dont ya think Viacom? Wattage Era began with PeppermintPattis whiny video about her cardboard boxes and her seeking attention from fellow youtubers. Argent VioletKitty Gothreaper Culexor Crossmack Pixelbee and many others would attempt to defeat the fat man without a face and would find  success. Pixelbee is suspected dead after choking on a car.Wattage Romantic and Eppigy would eventually quit as General Wattagecat decided to follow his religion closer. Mind you weev and I are both devout Christians. Its a total shame that Wattage had to leave us and we will always miss him. I could write another  paragraphs on Wattage era but thats already been done in his article.Wed see Nets aka Tfos alterboy join with his master and cause gay drama hed be opped for a short amount of time. Finney would represent lesbians everywhere with her opping. Januszeal would join yiri as a minor with ops and would eventually piss off ajt gvs boyfriend enough to get desysopped over some ddos irc drama. Sokevinsays aka ARAPESPIDER named after tfos first major contribution a spider on a cock that is clearly cumming would promise to help ajt and sherrod with lulzcon and then never follow through. Ajt would again rage and depriv.Chankachankaboo the only sysop to be older than ODB would join us. Shes historically been the only sysop who never gets on irc. But we understand cause I mean she was born before the Beatles formed. She left in  for reasons unknown. Oh yeah and she invented Offended. Jawsome was also opped around her time and would last a good year before disappearing.WhiteMystery was opped after Jawsome. WhiteMystery is also in that category of people that ED could not do without. He has the programming skills no one else has and hes the one that invented MysteryBot. Mind you MysteryBot taking over small repetitive tasks has caused a lot of h from ODB who will always refer to it as PakiBot. WhiteMystery was sysopped because Girlvinyl loves airheads. I shit you not. But wow it worked out well.Throughout all this time ed was a force. Lurkers would report drama Id assign people to start the article image people would draw up shoops further poking would occur and hot drama would be immediately front paged.Excuse my jumping around fucking congrats if youve read this far. Id be surprised if any non sysops gave a shit. Its hard to repeat all the big moments and people from so long ago. Its also worth noting that just about every sysop nomination in these days was by either myself or odb and just about every arbchat a favorite of EDiots a term invented by odb everywhere was performed by weev or myself.Pokchu was sysopped at the age of . This was a Bad Thing but we did not know at the time. Eventually his parents would be threatened with a lawsuit over an article he wrote. Pokchu would leave making sure to shit talk ED on rk years later.Somewhere around this time we had to deal with user registration being terminated. We sysops would chill on irc as randomers would come in and ask for their account. ODBs bragging about making WhiteMysterys account Zionistacat was the one who made Lmtes.cont,internetcollection,cn771jg,1,t5_35lar
7067108,0,t3_4ceeel,In her earliest versions of the story as here and here and also at Portkey Msscribes abusive flamer was a HarryHermione fan who became incensed that she and Cassandra Claire wrote slash incest etc. instead of sticking to Pumpkin Pie. Either she was now changing the story to make it fit better with GT or her fanfic Requital dissapointed two psychotic male fans in her first month in the fandom  one who liked HHr and one who liked HG  and they both persecuted her with persistent flames.He found out my full name then my home address. I got a package of religious themed books from him. I sent them back. More email. Some apologetic some nasty. They are all printed out and sitting in a little file at the campus police department where he goes or went to school. Why campus police? Because he hacked into my PC along with about a dozen others from a school computer. Left me about fifty .txt files all bible verses on my desktop.Msscribe has never revealed who Fermatojams other twelve victims might be.I had him arrested and my husband who is an attorney later dropped the charges on the condition he never contact me again.Two days after Msscribe wrote this Clarabella would tell the GT admins in a private email that far from dropping the charges Msscribe pressed charges against Fermatojam and took him to court. Eight days after she wrote this on June  Msscribe would affirm the story Clarabella told  that she pressed charges against Fermatojam and he received probation. But for the moment she was saying that she dropped charges just like Cassandra Claire did against Jeff.Next she alleges internet conspiracies possibly pointing to GTIts about how you and your friends didnt come forward with information when you had it and no one else did. Its about how you knew what he was doing and still protected him because he was in your inner circle.Its about people who meet and discuss how morally corrupt we all are yet watch us constantly....We also know the website where you meet and have these little discussions. How? Well interesting enough my stalker friend had a website and upon further investigation I was able to link it to your hideout. I viewed the source code and discovered where some of the lovely pics he had up were hotlinked to.Msscribe has never revealed where Fermatojams website was nor Killiganhashopes hideout and I have certainly been able to find no trace of them. Most of Msscribes friends seem to have taken all this as a reference to Gryffindor Tower but as you can see she didnt explicitly say so. She also doesnt make clear what was supposedly done to protect Fermatojam. And then she makes the infiltration threat which is just... weird. This post did not stay public for long I believe it was hidden in June of . Msscribe pursued other avenues of attack as well. She found an LJ entry from a young girl who was a GT member speaking negatively about adoption. On May  SarahKJames made this postA Request  I dont really know infoaome but can one of you link her to this post.Its horrible. A GTer...not shocked. I was contemplating not fanning the already abundant flames but this is insulting. I was adopted and am very bonded to my mother thank you very much. And she truly IS my mother. Im currently typing a response.infoaome an FA mod and generally wellliked fandom member who is an adoptive mother respondedmsscribe linked me  thanks for pointing it out. Ive gone and left my  cents. It was also on this day May  that Msscribes friend Infinitus suddenly and finally left the fandom. She made a post citing real life issues deleted her LJ and disappeared for good. Here is Msscribes post announcing the eventJust to keep mouths from yapping...  infoinfinitus just needs some time to destress chill deal with RL shit. Its all good though. Shell be back before we know it. She better be. Ill cry like a damn baby if she doesnt.Later that evening Msscribe made a second post disallowing commentsinfoinfinitus is gone. She needed to leave the fandom to take care of RL stuff. I love her like a sister. We started out in this fandom together at portkey.org became sort of the portkey grownups.   Always together her and I.I will miss her more than shell ever know. Dont really feel like saying much more.I still wonder if Infinitus was a reallife person either an innocent dupe or an accomplice of Msscribes who couldnt face the music. If she was an innocent dupe she might have done a little IP checking herself discovered Msscribes behavior and decided that she was too far implicated. If she was an accomplice she could have simply bailed. Of course if she was a sockpuppet her departure was just Msscribe tidying things up. I dont suppose Ill ever know. Infinituss decision to leave the fandom might also have something to do with the nearness of Nimbus which she had been planning to attend I wonder if she actually registered?. If she was a sockpuppet the reason she couldnt attend is obvious. Or perhaps she wasnt really the lovely woman whose picture she used so generously on her journal and icons. At any rate she disappeared and as far as I know has never been heard from since.Next GT made their move. Just after midnight that same night on May   infocarissalynn one of the admins at GT published this on her own LJ Time to Say Goodnight  There is an old saying Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. Im not fond of it in general because I am not a suspicious person by nature. However in the past few months it is a saying that has been at the front of my consciousness. Some things have happened that have made me realize that myself and my friends are more disliked by a certain group of people than I could ever have imagined. Why I dont know but it seems that some people cant forget things that happened nearly two years ago. Either that or they are just highly offended that we dont want to be part of their group. Either way it makes them seem really petty.Anyway back to my point it seems that someone has gone to great lengths to embarrass us and indirectly blame us for things that she in fact is responsible for. Im not sure why she did it perhaps it started out as a ploy for attention and when people started connecting her actions things she did while disguised as another person several in fact on both sides of the fence with GT she went with it. However I know its her. I have been collecting and checking IPs for a while now and have noticed a pattern. I didnt say anything for a long time because I wasnt positive but now Im almost  sure. All I have right now is circumstantial but when every IP you have traced back to the same place then you can be pretty sure that all the posts are being made by one person. Then when someone seemingly forgets to log out of their account and makes a post which also traces back to that place well you dont have to be a rocket scientist to figure that one out. The charade is over. This game has become tiresome.Note I have turned off the comment feature because I dont want eveyone involved in this. If you have a real comment feel free to email me. Dont email me asking who and what I am talking about. If you dont know I am not telling you. Im sure that while this is vague the person in question if she sees this will know I am refering to her.infocarissalynn deliberately made this post as a bait hoping to flush out Msscribe whom she knew was snooping around their LJs while working on the parody sockpuppets for infogthiddenroom and it worked. The next day she received a response  an email from Clarabella.Ill let Carissa tell in her own words  from the post she made two days later  what happened nextcont...,internetcollection,d1hf3ns,1,t5_35lar
9351845,0,t1_d91ewcx,SiahId like to take a whack at responding to some of this stuff.now that Im done writing this reply I gotta say Im sorry it is soOooo long. But Im not in the mood to edit this all down now and I dont know when Ill get to this if not now.First autumngrl nobody from Zendik sent you private messages. Please. The whole conspiracy aspect of this thread is silly. The guns and dragons on our website and threatening to report us to dept of Homeland Security for these RorschachBlot guns oh my god that is funny etc. But there is another aspect of the thread accusations that I believe deserve addressing. That said I must admit that getting myself to write this is like trying to psyche myself up to testify for the defense team in the Salem witch trials.introduction...I am Siah. Ive lived at Zendik Farm for almost  years. Im  and I have an eight year old daughter who lives here and was born at Zendik when we lived in Bastrop TX. I knew Red Lentil JohnP FNTW and Greensinger... maybe some others couldnt tell exactly who everyone is.LentilMy memory of Lentil is relatively clear. Im assuming you remember me Lentil but in case you dont roll This Is Your Life music there was a little ditty you wrote about me and some of the guys at Zendik back then...To the tune of Planet Claire by the BsThey came from planet dudeTheyre arrogant and rudeChens a paternal satelliteThey skate to Danzig every night Anyways my memory of Lentil as she says here totally miserable at Zendik Farm. There were some funny times that I remember too but if she doesnt care to remember them oh well... Im here to defend against her accusations right? After reading her recollections of the experience I guess she didnt feel like she was voluntarily in the situation she was in. That sucks but she was NOT forced or even coerced to stay. In fact the main thing I can say in defense of Zendik Farm en masse was that Lentil was asked to leave more than once or twice. Many people here at Zendik felt she was not happy not interested and not contributing. Of course that combo doesnt work. She really wanted to stay for some reason. She certainly didnt say I really only want to stay because you guys dont pay me. Id be out of here if I had the money for a bus ticket. Like she says she stayed for two years. I dont think she ever implied in her narrative that she was held against her will but others who joined the discussion seem to have jumped to that conclusion.Some of the stuff she described was sortof true in detail but WRONG in spirit. For instance the music and aesthetic censorship. I remember that era with disdain but it wasnt like Lentil says. There was no highup group who went on listening and dressing like normal. It was an idea probably Wulfs to sort of shock or force ourselves out of our normalness our complacency. Im not going to defend the idea of stopping all listening to commercial music reading commercial authors wearing commercial clothing etc mostly because I do all those things every day BUT the idea was introduced and embraced in the name of liberating ourselves from conditioning. Frankly Wulf sometimes came up with heavy handed ideas but they applied to himself as much as anyone. He was an intense genius and many of his ideas that didnt work were as intense an experience as those that did and do work. I remember crying one night and saying I just want to listen to the Misfits! BUT if I wanted the Misfits more than the experiment that was and is being a Zendik I would have left money or none. Of course personally I still have none money that is Ive got a copy of the Misfits box set though. Thank gawd.But Lentil you tell the tale in this way that makes it malicious and controlling. I dont mean to be mean but why would you have participated in ANY of the shit we were trying in that era if you didnt believe in the experiment and just viewed it as your rights being infringed upon?These bad reviews of living Zendik life have to be put in that context.Which context?The context that the idea of Zendik is to challenge the current normal philosophy of competition complacency accepting the status quo and accepting easy answers that make our egos feel good. Im not here to preach Zendik though Im here to defend it against charges. Read our website  hey youll see some cool guns and dragon eggs and who knows what elseHuh?the point I was trying to make is that we do weird things to ourselves here to break free from suburban values and reflexes. Personally Im proud of all that Ive gone through in the years Ive been here. Plenty of it Im VERY glad is over. I guess I can see how unfun it would be to live through these experimental phases if you didnt feel enthusiastic about the potential results of the experiments.For instance my Mom would be miserable here so would my brother most if not all of my friends from high school. I mean they have a good time when they visit but I wouldnt dream of suggesting to them that they should live here. For a certain type of person flexible of habit and with above average egostrength arrogance? and belief that they could be beyond normal this life is VERY rewarding. But what two people get out of an identical experience that is of course subjective.Another for instance your perspective on Zendik communalism being equivalent to living with your fellow employees... that just rubbed me the wrong way. But when I thought about it I guess it is a good illustration of how you viewed what was going on. We were your fellow employees you wanted to get away. I dont see it that way. We were and are striving together to make certain ideas again read the website for further info on that transcend concept into reality and we are bold enough to want to change the whole fucked up world in this direction. I respect the other people who I am engaged in that work with. They are who I want to fall asleep talking with and wake up and drink coffee with.Actually that leads me to another point...  years ago the era you describe as if it were still going on exactly that way today we were relatively isolated our magazines and TV shows pissed off as many people as they enlightened and I would be the first to admit the Zendik attitude needed some compassioning up. I like to think that Ive helped some in that direction. But NOW Zendik is much more inclusive and we are given attention not just as a radical commune but we are given respectful media and more and more people are getting the idea of what Zendik is really about.Living as a Zendik is much different and way better now than it was in the era you described over a decade ago the bad old days. Much has evolved. Lots of other stuff that you probably wouldnt have enjoyed has been tried and either dropped or adapted. But I dont really feel comfortable talking in this thread about what I see as the past or present problems of Zendik. Heck no. Im here to defend.Enemas and sex and such...In defense of enemas well Im pretty sure it is healthy to wash out all the built up toxins in your colon. I havent done an enema taken an enema? for years though. I guess some folks thought it was important back then dont really remember but enemas certainly werent forced or administered by anyone onto anyone else.Condoms are commonly used.Monogamy is practiced by many.Spec checks are still used as a form of birth control and this is another area in which I feel you wrongly described the spirit. Many women use the opportunity to talk and the physical knowledge of the state of your body is creative etc etc PLUS in a more spontaneous situation folks who dont want to procreate just use a condom. Ive actually never heard anyone complain about this before. Certainly no one is strapped down and specced.You might think it is weird to talk about openly about sex and as you can probably remembermost people who live here even more so  years ago arent exactly comfortable with it ourselves. But we believe that breaking through these moral codes even when it is uncomfortable is essential to the real work that we are pursuing and achieving with Zendik.cont,internetcollection,d91ewry,1,t5_35lar
9805432,0,t3_5fo3w7,Part My stomach burned with the heat of a thousand infernos. The Big Mac I had eaten in celebration of my victory was now tearing its way through my intestinal lining one membrane at a time. The freedom fries supplemented its attack on my stomach walls like fighter ships from an enemy carrier. My digestive system would be triumphant but not without a fight. The weight in my stomach grew heavier with each step but I pressed on. It was getting dark out and I had to make it home soon I had to get those credits and I had to make off like a   in the night. After a painful march I arrived. I sat down logged onto AIM and was barraged with a flurry of messages. HardHead Hey can I wire those credits now? I wanna secure my spot in the pool. Ive been waiting for you all day its about time you got home.Me Okay go ahead and do it. Ill be on Eve in a bit to verify that the credits were sent.Jorpho Hello. The other investors and I have been waiting for you we want to send the isk quickly so you can buy the blueprint and get to work. If I understand correctly do you now have all the isk you need? Me No were still  million isk short of our goal since Alltech hasnt come through yet. Ive invested everything I have into this deal but I can still borrow up to  million from the members of my corporation. It all depends I suppose on how Alltech votes.Jorpho Oh I talked to Magnulus. They were in the process of voting a few hours ago I havent heard from him since.Me Hmm.. Okay Ill check my email. You can go ahead and wire the money Ill be on Eve in a bit.Thoggins Go into Eve and Ill send you the isk. Dont do anything stupid with it or Ill have to act on my threats. You have no idea how serious I am about this.Me Okay.A euphoric daze passed over me briefly as reality dawned anew. I would be scamming this prick out of his money out of  million of his preciously farmed credits and he wouldnt be able to do a damn thing about it. I could envision his parents house being surrounded by SWAT teams. The county police chief would be holding a megaphone shouting into it.Thoggins! COME OUT OF THE BASEMENT NOW WITH YOUR HANDS IN THE AIR. DO NOT MAKE ANY SUDDEN MOVEMENTS.He would emerge a short fat man wearing a flowing black trench coat and dark Oakley sunglasses. His hands would be in his pockets and he would loudly proclaimThe library workers are all dead! Dead! They stole my money so I killed them with my bare hands and I will kill all of you too!He would then start to pull something out of his pocket and the entire LAPD SWAT team would open fire on him. The  millimeter hollowpoint bullets would penetrate his soft flesh and expand creating large breaches in each of his vital organs. They would continue to shoot through his body and exit out his back leaving a gaping hole that would spurt out blood and various torn off chunks of cartilage. They would keep pumping round after round into his fallen disfigured mass making sure that he was good and dead. And when they finally got around to investigating the body they would find out that he was reaching for a pumped super soaker pistol filled with laundry detergent.The police chief would then say Well boys aint that an ace in the hole! They would collectively chuckle raid his house for small bills and finish off the day at Scarlets strip club.I opened up Outlook eagerly checking for a new email from Magnulus. Finally I found it.Dear NightfreezeAfter much debate and reflection and a narrow vote my corporation has decided that it would be in our best interest to invest in your Apocalypse blueprint pool. Since as you repeatedly noted it will take well over a month for a  million credit investor to receive their BP we have made the decision to invest  million. I have taken the liberty of wiring this money to you and I pray that the pool will reach its goal soon. Best regardsMagnulusI logged into Eve and saw that I had several messages in my ingame inbox. I clicked through each of them and suddenly my credit balance jumped from  figures to .  million credits. It was done! I had joined the greats and became one of the illustrious and famed men who would forever live in Eves history. I was going to live another life a life devoid of mining and trading! A life of grace and wealth and happiness! It was true. It was not a dream from which I would wake. The past was past. My muddied room now seemed gay and in spite of all I had done it. I transferred the credits to my alternate character Tachz and logged off. Staring at Nightfreezes face in the character selection screen I wiped a single tear off my cheek as I clicked the delete button. I picked up the phone and called Trazir.Hello?Hey man Ive got some bad news. Are you sitting down?Uh no hold on.Seconds passed and an even greater smile broke out across my face.Okay what is it?One of the investors figured out this was a scam. They all pulled out their money were basically at ground zero again dude.GOD DAMN IT! DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG I WORKED ON THOSE FORUM POSTS? DO YOU? DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH TIME I WASTED ON THIS SHIT?Hey man Im just fucking with you. They all invested their money I deleted Nightfreeze and my Tachz is now the proud owner of  million credits.A powerful silence passed over the phone. I hoped he wasnt having an asthma attack.You might want to delete your character too man once they find out we scammed them theyre gonna be pissed. Very very pissed.Yeah. YEAH. FUCK YEAH. WE DID IT MAN WE DID IT.I know we did. I know.Now we just had to figure out how to spend it.,internetcollection,dalqar8,1,t5_35lar
