3788197,0,t1_cqo2t9z,I recently bought I think its The Songcrafters Coloring Book by Bill Pere cuz I was reading reviews and they basically said its very in depth. But several of Pattisons books are on my wish list as well. In fact I might pick  or  up since I got paid. I kinda got free form down as far as writing. But I feel you. I got stuck trying too hard but idk had some kind of epiphany reading the book. Like wait. This isnt a completely new thing. You did this before. Now just tweak it. But I wanna be a multisyllabic rhyming clever metaphor wielding wordsmith. I admire that in other rappers andor writers who already got it. But Im also trying to get comfortable with my flow and find my voice cuz those arent the only good songs or good writersrappers. I just as I mentioned really respect artists who can do it and I want to be one of them lol. ,ratemysong,cqo321p,1,t5_2zd31

8679729,0,t3_4yknbh,I think its a good song.  I really like the tone of your voice and it has an interesting raspiness to it.  Its very catchy but I think its very similar to other countryhip hop songs Ive heard.,ratemysong,d6ql91a,1,t5_2zd31

10006268,0,t3_5ivhq8,Your stuff has a very clean soothing sound. Its nice. In regards to the track you posted my question would be if youre able to bring some of the variation that you have towards the end earlier into the song? I start to get tired of the repetition of the melodic line in the intro and thats something I would change if it were my song. Like I said though its got a nice chill vibe. ,ratemysong,dbbug9j,1,t5_2zd31
