Tons of homes and apartments within walking distance of the Vanguard building so you wont be short on options. Lots to do in the area just depends on what you like to do in your free time.I hope you enjoy your new position!,Scottsdale,cgbr7m2,2,t5_2qnfl

1793481,0,t3_2f25tl,I have lived in Scottsdale for many years. Old Town has something for everyone but it is definitely more shiny sparkly than Tempe. I have spent years hanging out in both Tempe on Mill and Old Town and I love them both. I moved here when I was  and now Im  and I still like to hit bars in both places.Kierland is really corporatey and mostly for tourists. Thats where the apple store is. Lots of hiking and running. The greenbelt runs the entire length of the city with bridges and underpasses so you dont cross traffic directly for miles. Lots of people run in the summer. If you acclimate and hydrate and be aware of your limits its doable.Living in Tempe is harder than Scottsdale because of the university traffic which is insane and there is the large homeless population who congregate in Tempe. Crime stats are higher in Tempe than Scottsdale. I have lived in both cities and I prefer to live in Scottsdale.Its a great place to live. ,Scottsdale,ck57v1v,1,t5_2qnfl

6679595,0,t3_472hj9,Should run it down Camelback Rd and then down Scottsdale Rd to meet up with Tempe. That is a nice square of Downtown Biltmore Old Town and Temp. Be nice to build those areas up to be more urban. Cant see it happening though. ,Scottsdale,d0a891t,3,t5_2qnfl
