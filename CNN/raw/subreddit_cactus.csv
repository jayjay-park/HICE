I would save the one on the left unearth remove ALL soil from roots and let it dry and perform surgery on the right one at the narrow point above the rotting segment. Leave both to dry and let the wounded one heal callous. Then later replant them in fresh sandy soil throw this away in a welldrained pot and let them root anew.

6527632,0,t1_czq80if,My cresting geometrizans is bigger than yours but was still really awkwardly lopsided with no reasonable way to take a cutting without damaging more flesh than was necessary.  Because I both didnt want to put it in the ground and didnt have a suitable location for it but it was growing so unevenly that it wouldve fallen over regardless of what support I gave it I risked the cutting.  After taking the cutting I dusted both the wound and cutting with sulfur sulfur is an antifungal antibacterial and antiinsecticide but you dont want to breath it or get it in your eyes  I wear goggles and an n face mask when Im using sulfur powder and have a designated brush to apply it that I sanitize between uses.I havent rooted the cutting yet but managed to take a terribly awkward piece off  that makes the rest of my myrtillo much more balanced and allows future cuttings to be simpler because its easier to access potential cutting points.  The cutting and main plant both calloused over fine and the main plant is starting to throw out another crest.I also removed several cuttings from mine where the nursery had allowed growth to revert to normal myrtillo growth patterns  I bought a seriously big specimen for  from a pottery place that sells plants also but normally doesnt carry plants in the winter bc they are in a microclimate where frost is common  they were worried about frost damage and had it at a steep discount.  When we first got it home I was both less familiar with how to handle cacti and didnt have welding gloves yet which are better for serious hands on work than any cacti gloves Ive found and mine were  a pair  they are rarely penetrated by anything and when they are its never been deep enough to do more than slightly break the skin and we were seriously uncertain as to how to repot it since it was clearly too big for its pot actually repotting it again has been on my to do list we didnt buy a pot big enough the first time.  While manuevering to try to get it both repotted and the trunk vertical it was way off center in the plastic pot it came in the person holding the towel that was holding it up had the towel slip.  The whole thing probably . feet tall and bulky as hell went from vertical to horizontal instantly with no support at all.  The landing didnt damage it  theres not even superficial scarring where it landed.I valued ensuring the genetics were okay enough that I bothered with sulfur since I love cresting myrtillos  and I would suggest the same.  But as dropping the whole thing demonstrated although I dont remember where I heard it Ive found that the mantra you cant hurt the plant is more or less true.  Cacti can stand up to way way more abuse than you expect them to be able to.Guess Ill be trying to root my crest cutting along with the others this week ,cactus,czuicb2,2,t5_2qpr6

8597378,0,t1_d6g1qez,Looked at your photo as a matter of course. I would guess your perpetrator is a slug most likely or it could be a snail depending on where you live. Slugs hide under rocks and litter where they can keep moist as they have no shell. Snails often rest nearer to a food source where than feel they can be safe. Most often they will go back down to the base of a pot or plant. So to find the culprits look around your pots move them all and clean up litter. Remove plants and loose rocks away from your potted plants. Most often the damage from pests like snails and slugs will occur after a heavy rain when there is enough moisture for them to be active. Then in daylight hours if things heat up and dry out they run for cover. Snails like shade so they dont cook while slugs will go under something. Eves Needles are fairly robust and will take most types of soil. I dont know about coffee grounds. I would guess it would be a type of organic material. You wont have an issue with Eves Needles so long as its no more than about  percent of total organic material added to the soil. Even then Eves Needles are fairly tough and Ive yet to see one have a problem with this. They can even take more water than most cactus and just grow more lush. As for propagation just wait till you have a nice section that is narrow where it grows to the main plant body and then slice through the narrow part. Let it heal over for about two weeks in a cool dry place. It should heal up to look nice and white. Then plant in dry soil for another couple weeks before watering. It should start rooting right away. These plants root very easily from my personal experience. Your plant looks nice by the way. Even with the damage which should heal up nicely. ,cactus,d6g9ior,1,t5_2qpr6

9180541,0,t3_55obsz,Looks like scale insects Hemiptera to me. This link shows a couple of pictures that resemble what you have  There are a number of ways to get rid of the problem...from picking and destroying the insects...to using a toothbrush dipped in a solution of liquid detergent and rubbing alcohol a weak solution. Not too strong. Cactus Lover has a blog that Ive gone to a number of times in search of answers. They have an article on treating scale problems  Good luck. ,cactus,d8fp8nb,1,t5_2qpr6

9581002,0,t3_5c4akz,Its likely dead. If yoy unpotted it itll be entirely mush in the middle. In the future never use regular potting soil for cacti. Only tropical and subtropical species can really tolerate organic soils the rest need inorganic mineral soil. Whatever soil you use make sure it is fast draining and dries out between waterings. Most cactus species are winter dormant and do not like water during dormancy. Watering during dormancy can potentially kill more sensitive species. As far as sublight goes some species like more sun than others. Ill hazard a guess that this one needed full sun. In the future harden off any indoor plants before putting them in direct sunlight as the light can burn and potentially kill your plant.Sorry about your cactus friend. Get another one and try again!,cactus,d9u1yoq,4,t5_2qpr6

10327279,0,t1_dcelds7,unless you are prepared to winter your plants indoors i know people who do this for over a hundred plants annually the main thing you can do is grow cacti that can survive your climate  there are many natives of your region and of others that would be fine i have a couple dozen species outside in pots and in the ground our official low so far this year has been  Fthe other thing you can do for outdoor plants is understand the microclimates around your home i choose protected places for some of the plants and i doubt theyve seen zero,cactus,dcenkwh,3,t5_2qpr6

10467947,0,t1_dcthn8j,Just a guess on my part based on what you wrote. Seems like its rotting from below. Possible cause would be over watering during cool weather and being indoors. Indoor plants have less energy on account they are often deprived of direct sunlight. Also thats a plastic pot so its going to promote fungus and infections. ,cactus,dcund5o,1,t5_2qpr6
