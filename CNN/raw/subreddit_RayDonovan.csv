1551781,0,t1_cix7af5,I thought that the clinical way he went about neatly removing his fine clothing and stashing it before going full Southie shirtless with a bat was a good sequence.  I actually didnt quite expect the bat until he removed it from the trunk.,RayDonovan,cjasfar,2,t5_2t5rq

1698898,0,t3_2du5qb,Rays really not that terrible to them. Obviously Abby has reason to be resentful but his kids need to grow up. What does Abby even do all day? Parent those kids come on. But parenting does not mean religiously snooping through your kids things either. If you can find some jewelry in your daughters room but not remember your sons birthday when he reminds you of it you got worse problems than your husband being a manwhore.And Bunchy. What a punching bag. Give the guy a win for once. And Terry eh let him go to Ireland why not? The brothers and Mickey are the most interesting Donovans on the show. Let all the brothers ride off into the sunset together!,RayDonovan,cjtb502,9,t5_2t5rq

1849920,0,t3_2frkbh,I really hope that Ray gives Cookie a bullet instead of the rights to Marvin amp ReKons music. ,RayDonovan,ckc40ap,16,t5_2t5rq
1854893,0,t1_ckcojvt,Ezra is so irritating. However when he refused to give Cookie the rights to Reckons and Marvins catalogs and Ray told him that Bridget was in the car the way he automatically changed his mind showed me that there is still a sense no matter how small of a redeeming quality in this guy. ,RayDonovan,ckcpk8b,11,t5_2t5rq
1905188,0,t3_2gfj1p,Hate to say it but the best part about this show are the trailers. Makes every episode seem like its going to be amazing but then it turns out just alright. ,RayDonovan,ckirhkb,-1,t5_2t5rq
1957678,0,t1_ckoymxf,He left and called the cops on them otherwise the cops probably wouldnt have gotten there until morning when they tried to open up shop. But yeah not a very good plan as far as actually making Mickey get caught. Especially since Mickey and Daryll apparently had enough time to get away scotfree after they could hear the police sirens...,RayDonovan,ckp3pov,8,t5_2t5rq
2006806,0,t3_2hq91f,Hes a throwback to the old gangsters and provides contrast when placed in Rays world. I feel that Mickey is trying to do the right thing in his own way but things have changed since he went inside. You can see elements of Ray in him in almost everything that he does and hes always good for a bit of a laugh when on screen most of the time.,RayDonovan,ckv0nk6,10,t5_2t5rq
2008173,0,t3_2hqvlp,Wow. That previously on segment pretty much means that theyre going to try to close every plot line from this season? This should be interesting. ,RayDonovan,ckv6kpu,7,t5_2t5rq

5042647,0,t1_cut0jj4,I love seeing them together. Abbey is so maternal towards Terry. How she takes care of him after he has his accident. I was like awe... I hope they stay friends and they dont have an affair...,RayDonovan,cuttw4n,9,t5_2t5rq

8470055,0,t3_4voiqq, Connor is running and then trips and accidentally shoots himself in the head just like the scientist in World War Z  Connor accidentally shoots the baby in the head and Ray has to handle his most tragic body disposal assignment yet.  Connor accidentally shoots a random black guy and faces no consequences whatsoever.  Connor accidentally shoots his mother but the bullets only hit the part of her breasts with cancer in them.  Connor gets caught masturbating by his sister and shoots her so she wont tell anyone,RayDonovan,d60aotz,9,t5_2t5rq

8645383,0,t3_4yagp4,I cant remember her name but isnt the art dealer the only one who knows he was there that night because she sent Ray with the money? Unless they have surveillance footage of him in the warehouse or the art dealer talks I dont know how theyd tie him to the crime. The art dealer seems to have taken quite a shine to Ray so I dont know if she would rat him out. Basically I have no idea.,RayDonovan,d6ma8n1,1,t5_2t5rq
8696806,0,t1_d6m20l8,What does she even want? I dont understand. I hate their whole story I dont care about those two at all. Edit ah sorry thought that was the boxers sister. ,RayDonovan,d6sqcw7,1,t5_2t5rq

9001477,0,t3_53ir1m,Beats me but iirc theres been only one sleazy politician in the series so far. That could be an interesting direction.And if they could bring back Ian McShane thatd be great. Id watch him read the phone book as long as he had a drink in his hand and dropped a few fbombs doing it . . .,RayDonovan,d7tu6gi,1,t5_2t5rq
9035144,0,t3_53yeup,That always happens with this show the last eps of the first three seasons werent the best either The writers are too afraid of changing up the formula and reset everything after each season,RayDonovan,d7xvqk8,2,t5_2t5rq

10282851,0,t3_5n7fcs,The show completely collapses if you look even an inch under the surface. The traffic thing has always bothered me as well.,RayDonovan,dc9m8v1,1,t5_2t5rq
11502736,0,t3_598zm0,Just started watching myself. Im having issues with Abby as well. I think Ray is more transparent. While he may not provide details on everything theres no way Abigail isnt aware of what he is doing to an extent for a living. She bitches all the time but is once again happy when he buys her something. ,RayDonovan,dfzu2wu,1,t5_2t5rq
