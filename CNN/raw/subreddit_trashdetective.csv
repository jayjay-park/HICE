Unfamiliar sodaenergy drinks seem to have North American stylinglanguage on them but dont appear to be American. Definitely not  French either so Canada made sense.Food and beverages point to someone seeking quick sustenancebursts of energy which can point to someone not getting enough sleep or rushing around as a busy student or professional. Also multiple Starbucks cups mean someone with disposable income but the lack of kids food wrappers excessive junk mail or envelopes from bills brightly colored wrappings or toy boxes rule out busy parentstay at home mom.Mostly just context clues.
