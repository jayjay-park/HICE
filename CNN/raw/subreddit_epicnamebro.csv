7572587,0,t1_d32ynx3,It has less areas and bosses than the other games and takes less time to complete even without taking into account subjectivities such as people being better at Souls now than then ergo its shorter. End of story.,epicnamebro,d32ysjb,-5,t5_36esj

7631324,0,t3_4jsgoz,A question for the lot on here... how is this fight supposed to be seen if i remember right in DS u had a good and evil ending the evil ending being you take the fire  power for ur self after beating Gwyn thus making u lord  king of the land and whatnot is it that we are fighting in the Soul of Cinder fight? are we fighting us self from prior games? cause thats how i initially saw it when i fininshed the game the first time. also cause the Soul of Cinder armor is so reminicent to the old knight armor in DS im just going off memory here so please dont bash me to hard if im totally wrong,epicnamebro,d39n21m,0,t5_36esj

7636084,0,t1_d3a1n0g,Because most people dont like discussions. They have their opinion and everybody who thinks otherwise is a and I quote Idiot neckbeards. Usually those people dont get very far in life but thats a different story. Critic is good as long as its not personal. If you like something you want to continue liking it. If you think that the quality decreases you critic something and hope that it lives up to your standards any time soon again. If you are a fanboy so be it but there are others who dont swallow everything they got thrown at. You can critic something and still love it thats what many dont get.,epicnamebro,d3a6htt,5,t5_36esj
7641129,0,t1_d3ag6l8,The thing is he has little to no sense of awe wonder or discovery in the last  episodes... Its not him getting gud that most of the criticisms are about they point out his lack of those aspects mentioned above. It is his raw reactions and they have been  complaining straight up saying this sucks ass etc. I still enjoy watching these for the RARE awecomments not whining without reason nor thought on the game but his overall lack of focus has rubbed many people the wrong way. The nd play through WILL be much better and people need to realize this and accept this for what it is.,epicnamebro,d3ar5ky,6,t5_36esj

7725521,0,t1_d3kb1vp,Im pretty sure its heavily implied Karla is Zullie and Alva the Wayfarers daughter. Thats why you fight Alvanow called Seeker of the Spurned in DS outside Irythill Dungeon and then find Alvas armor set right near Karlas cell. He was searching for Karla who in one of the item descriptions in this video is called a spurned childor something like that.,epicnamebro,d3kc5xd,2,t5_36esj
