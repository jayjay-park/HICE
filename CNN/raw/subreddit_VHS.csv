9007164,0,t1_d7ub6vp,UPDATE So I woke up and saw that both the Power and Charging indicator lights were blinking same as it was last time I took the battery off . The manual I have in the box doesnt say anything about this just that the Charging light should turn off when the battery is full. The battery I have isnt the exact same model as the oem but is designed to work with camcorders and has the same output voltage of v. It just has Ah vs the oem which only had mAh. Could it be that the oem charger doesnt know how to properly charge this larger battery? The only indication I can find of the battery being too old is the copyright dated  on the box it came in.ALSO whenever I put the oem battery on the charger the Charging light just freaks out and starts flickering like crazy. Putting either the oem battery or this new one on the camera yield the same result in the camera not even attempting to turn on so theres that similarity...,VHS,d7uiqbb,1,t5_2sauc

10202795,0,t3_5lul6q,VHSDVD Player units will not output a VHS video signal through the component or HDMI ports. VHSDVD Recorders will though which is what the OP bought. So youre very lucky you got a recorder. However I do have one possible complication for you before you use the HDMI output to capture footage on your computer. The reason it looks better on your TV may be that your TV is just much better at interpreting an HDMI signal than composite. They dont build new TVs with yearold legacy devices in mind. So when you go to actually capture the footage you may still get better results using RCA cables. ,VHS,dc0jl8p,1,t5_2sauc

Piping it through the VCR might give you a slightly different look than if you went straight to the capture card I imagine it has to look at least a bit different since you also have to tune to lineout but youre very unlikely to notice it.The thing is tape errors are called that for that specific reason. If you want the wobble jitter flicker and all the other imperfections then youll have to record to the tape.
