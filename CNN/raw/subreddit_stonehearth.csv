95547,0,t1_cep7wzi,If you kick start for the rewards you are doing it wrong. You kick start to give the company the needed starting funds. Feeling like you have been given the short end of the stick when they offer a similar pack for backers at a later stage is ridiculous. We are in different stages of development wanting things to stay exclusive is a bit retarded when the game hasnt been released yet. The company should do everything it can to make sure it makes everyone happy. while still maintaining the integrity of the game they are making ofc From the backers to the people purchasing down the road on release. And giving out a collectors edition should in no way make a backer feel like hes being left out. Especially as OP suggested by having it also as an upgrade function.And Im talking cosmetics here. If they actually added game mechanics past a certain point and would charge for it in the form of an expansion so be it. If at this point you complain as a kick starter you should seriously reconsider kick starting ever again in the future.,stonehearth,cepb3ki,1,t5_2wlq1

1204981,0,t3_27w0kh,This is the most exciting update to this point for me right now!

2934779,0,t1_co1n9cv,Much less work goes into the aforementioned with a voxel game.Much much much less work.Just to copy and paste my other answerNot in the scale that traditional AAA or even just normal D engine titles have to.With a D game you need to have a realistic animation cycle match with a good looking animation cycle.In this voxel based game whimsical animations can just as easily be used as a high grade one.Theres infinitely less work in doing these things on a voxel based game than on a full D game.,stonehearth,co1p38f,-4,t5_2wlq1

I tried a small town with small buildings and not a lot of stuff on the ground though I did have a fair bit ready to be made into things making and selling items as much as possible.

11253233,0,t3_60m5ul,I hope it stays in alpha for a lot longer. I feel like the game is pretty much half way there atm. Maybe slightly less but theyll only get better and faster. I think it needs another year and a half on. Id rather them bring out a game theyre confident in and proud of. If not then it could be another NMS issue where they release an incomplete game that had promise! As it stands I feel that everytime a new alpha comes out. I play it for a couple of hours then dont play it again until a new alpha. Im worried I will get bored before a release. Im hoping they bring out a shit load of new stuff when it gets released for us alpha players! ,stonehearth,df7jcl8,9,t5_2wlq1
11256494,0,t1_df7my33,Geomancers and Magmasmiths still need to be implemented. Geomancers if they have the ability to manipulate the landscape add to it could provide some major gameplay elements. I also feel that the Engineer isnt fully realized yet.Seasons. If its not just a pallet swap but brings about implications based on weather or temperature would be another potentially major additionIm pretty sure another kingdom is coming and a ton more monster types elementals titans. On their roadmap another race is even mentioned Dwarves.Lastly multiplayer its on their roadmap. I have my doubts itll ever be implemented but that would be a game changer.,stonehearth,df7wna1,6,t5_2wlq1
