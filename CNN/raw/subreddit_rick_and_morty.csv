Either it was a mistake on the part of the animators or it could be some kind of wellhidden plot hint.  Edit Now that Ive thought about it a little maybe the nondrool Rick was a different one that was secretly colluding there had to be at least one other Rick out there that shared his hate for the federation and the council with the Main Rick as an inside agent and their plan required them to be in two different places at that point. At some point after the stand off scene the Real Rick swaps back in thus the drool coming back and the other Rick slipped out somehow.,rick_and_morty,dfqt32u,3,t5_3hlqp
