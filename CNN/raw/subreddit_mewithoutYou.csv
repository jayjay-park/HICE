1652313,0,t3_2d9dkt,I started listening to the band with Brother Sister so I cam to AB Life relatively late. Its probably my least favourite of their albums and certainly the one I listen to the least frequently but Id still rate it pretty highly  and I think it shows a lot of the promise the band has lived up to with subsequent releases. Their song structures melodies atmospheric instrumentation in the intros and outros to songs all that stuff is present or at least developed on this record.Its strange I listen to some loud and aggressive music but part of why I cant really listen to this album the same way I can any of their later ones is because it is SO relentlessly angry and aggressive  and I think it all comes down to Aarons vocals and how well he can emote even when hes at his most raw like on these tracks. Its difficult for me to listen to not just because of how abrasive it sounds but because theres almost an emotional weight to it thats hard to tolerate outside of infrequent listens. I find myself feeling drained and exhausted every time I listen to this record front to back and usually need to listen to a palette cleanser of something clean and instrumental before I can move on with my day it just now occurs to me that those are what the A and B track could be for!.,mewithoutYou,cjnfrhz,3,t5_2sipq

3828664,0,t1_cqscfnq,I more or less agree with your understanding of the meaning behind Nine Stories. Still Im not sure that Id have the patience to make my own way to that understanding unless I had already heard the bands earlier albums. Thats not because Im lazy not just because Im lazy anyways but also because there are a fair number of non sequiturs and obscure metaphors if Nine Stories isnt the best example of that other songs on the album are. I love this band so Im willing to sit down and figure it out but it doesnt automatically make the song more artistic just because its difficult to understand. That wasnt really an issue for me on earlier releases especially with regard to the non sequiturs. There were always obscure metaphors but they didnt overtake the songs. Im not denying that Ten Stories is a good album Im just suggesting that clarity is an important part of effective communication. My favourite section of Grist For The Malady Mill is a good example of this. See below  Three miles more til Flagstaff  Follow behind signs toward Badger Pass  Wound like clocks around fretboards  Carved out hands in our basswood body guitars   borrowed guitars borrowed hands!  Im clearly not as handsome or caring as what you seem to want  but Id gladly walk you home  cause those streets can be dangerous  Shepherd the Southwest wind  railspikes ripped like the seam of a wineskin  Shepherd the Northwest rain  frog switch slipped and that reckless beast is to blame  Aint it an awful shame!  And dont it just break your heart to hear of so much pain?I still have trouble figuring out the connection between the first paragraph and the second here. Does elephant enjoy playing the guitar? I also have trouble figuring out how we go from borrowed guitars to talking about this girl in the first paragraph. Is elephant concerned about her handsomeness? I love the last lines of the first paragraph as individual lyrics they might even be my favourite in all of mewithoutyous songwriting history but when you put the whole thing together its a lot harder to figure out whats going on. ,mewithoutYou,cqsp7cr,1,t5_2sipq

4300995,0,t1_csaccze,Aarons always been a lyricist who draws from the literature hes read prior to writing songs and in recent interviews hes mentioned that one of his recent inspirations was James Joyce whose writing style was all kinds of convoluted. So while I agree that its harder to read I think James Joyce is probably more to blame than Aaron.I also didnt mean this as an Oh youre wrong Aarons writing is always amazing but as an explanation as to WHY the lyrics may be more labyrinthine.,mewithoutYou,csag395,2,t5_2sipq
