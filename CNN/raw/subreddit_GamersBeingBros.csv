9810698,0,t1_damd11a,Isnt Heroes of the Storm made up of a bunch of Blizzard game charactersheroes? So could that be considered an original IP? If it is then yeah youre right on that.Also Im glad people were able to move on a bit from TF to Overwatch. TF is imo getting pretty dated. Its been around for  years but its amazing how well it has kept a strong community. But I think its time for Valve to finally release a new installment to the series. This can be said for A LOT of stuff from Valve From what I hear the updates they put out arent doing TF much good.Also just looked up the DOTA thing. Never knew it started off a Warcraft mod.,GamersBeingBros,damdn2l,2,t5_3hiqs

Most people would rather an autoreload be as far away as possible so reloading between encounters will always ensure youre good to get a kill. Especially in Halo where it can take a third of your magazine to kill someone.,GamersBeingBros,dgsfikr,1,t5_3hiqs
