The Aedes aegypti being that close to Manhattan makes the CDC numbers for New York more understandable. |State|Cases |As of Date||||||New York|| July ||New York || July ||New York | | June |,zika,d5dke89,1,t5_3c59u
8364834,0,t1_d5luc35,There are a few oddities about your comments Mosquito control is a LOCAL responsibility not a federal one. While essentially correct Florida monitors mosquito through its Florida Department of Agricuttue and Consumer Services  Mosquito Control program and their website cites they operate under the authority of Chapter  Florida Statutes the Mosquito Control Act. The program administers approximately  million in grants and provides technical assistance certification and training to mosquito control programs throughout the state.  Additionally the University of Florida monitors  Mosquito Control Programs throughout the state. Mosquito control is a local matter but the State of Florida participates with the localities. Doing so fosters faster dissemination of useful information.Controlling the Mosquito population in Florida is an effort fraught with difficulty. Daily rains combined with the large number of ponds lakes creeks and waterways along with the states high water table makes bringing Floridas mosquito population under control an impossibility if the intention is their elimination.  We should be exercise caution when seeking to remove the food source for animals above them on the food chain least we look down at our plates one day and find them empty. As you stated there are controls that can be exerted by the people of Florida in and around their homes and property. The only thing the federal government can do is provide how to information. Preventive measures each person can put in place to reduce mosquitoes in their immediate vicinity.  Unfortunately it is only effective if comprehensive. Examining the mosquito studies done in South America it became readily apparent Zika infected mosquitoes are extremely difficult to find.  I am interested in reading of the five Aedes mosquitoes that have ever been found in the wild in the western hemisphere to be carrying Zika. Please pass me a link to the information. Controlling mosquito population is an impossibility. The only effective control method seen so far is to modify the mosquito population by introducing Wolbachia.  The Australian project trying to eliminate Dengue Fever is introducing Wolbachia into the local mosquito population. Wolbachia blocks the Zika virus in Aedes aegypti  mosquito. At this point however it is still a project being studied and if a similar study were to start in the US it would take years before it begin due to it actually being able to address and resolve the matter. Wed see a steady line of lawyers representing one group or another wanting to add their cents worth. Here is a visual representation of what Wolbachia doesExcerpt from the Cell Host amp Microbe article shown abovegt Here we report that Aedes aegypti harboring Wolbachia are highly resistant to infection with two currently circulating Zika virus isolates from the recent Brazilian epidemic. Wolbachiaharboring mosquitoes displayed lower viral prevalence and intensity and decreased disseminated infection and critically did not carry infectious virus in the saliva suggesting that viral transmission was blocked. Our data indicate that the use of Wolbachiaharboring mosquitoes could represent an effective mechanism to reduce Zika virus transmission and should be included as part of Zika control strategies.  Introducing Wolbachia into local Mosquito populations is extremely easy.  The Eliminate Dengue Fever details the process. It involves have a list of addresses census roles a strip of paper with Wolbachia infused mosquito eggs a small receptacle able to hold water and the ability to duplicate the process throughout the summer months. The CDC has been seeking to garner a larger budget since before the Ebola Outbreak in West Africa. After seeing the WHO stumble Dr. Thomas Frieden CDC director since  sought to increase the CDCs range of responsibilities. Perhaps this is why a national agency with no international mandate had CDC staffers volunteer to do tours in west Africa.  The Zika Outbreak could be seen as a means of leveraging an increase the CDCs budget and sphere of influence.They are also the federal agency responsible for sending live Anthrax samples to outside organizations in  and only learned of the gross error when notified by those receiving the samples. For more information see  At this time we do not suspect any risk to the general public.  Anthrax Investigation Finds More Security Breaches At CDCRemember folks his name is Dr. Thomas Frieden hes from the government and hes here to help us.

8595358,0,t1_d6fzkax,Theyre creating eggs on an industrial scale so they can release millions per month from one factory but youre right on the fact that itll only be a localized effect. The mosquito population will not decrease too far beyond the factory this is just a temporary fix for a small area.,zika,d6g0elc,1,t5_3c59u
