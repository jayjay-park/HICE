2537557,0,t1_cmps5yn,Thanks dude.We put this on in one month. It was a nightmare on our end but we had to put the event on. I realize how this is coming across but if you know us or even try to youd understand. There were no other options and people should know how bad it used to suck here but there are people in this town who are upset that they arent the ones doing what we are doing so they hate. Weve made the sacrifices though financial and personal. We work almost  days a week and my brother barely gets to see my parents who are getting older I dont know any of my cousins kids or the rest of our extended family because of it and thats really important to me. Yeah I dont see how as an outsider you could say it was great but still..,chicagoEDM,cmpsmg2,2,t5_2t3zh
