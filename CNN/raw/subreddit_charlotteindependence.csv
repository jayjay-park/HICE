6410881,0,t1_czhw3pp,Got to listen to it all earlier today. Before hand I was weary as you pointed out about the lengthyness of the podcast. But i found myself being disappointed by the end that it couldnt be longer! It was very entertaining the guest speaker was a cool guy and the hosts were pretty damn funny too. They seemed to drag on the rapids talk for quite a bit in the middle of the cast i didnt mind too much as it is a pretty interesting situation. And it makes sense because their guest speaker took time out of his morning to discuss the Rapids. And in the end they are our affiliate so they do have influence to our success. The beginning talk about memorial was a good listen. A little disheartening because it feels so far away until we can ever actually make significant progress with memorial and the county. But like the hosts said we are making some sort of progress just by the fact its at least being discussed by public officials.Its slipping my mind exactly what they concluded their podcast with discussing. All i remember was getting extremely excited and hopeful for this upcoming season. Small bits that come to mind that specifically got me excited was them talking about how much buzz the soccer community of charlotte was generating for independence when USL released the schedule national support for Charlotte being a MLS market and our new unofficial mascot. Lol i forget the horses name at the momment but remember it being funny!All in all imma have to check out their first podcast from this season and im excited to listen to them each epidode!tldr entertained. Didnt realize my post was so lengthy! Sorry!,charlotteindependence,czicpjo,2,t5_33ylz
