280622,0,t1_cf9uih6,No Im just asking if the word for men should be laqueristo. I just noticed on the sidebar that theres a link for Laqueristo Blogs so I guess that would be the male equivalent of laquerista. ,malepolish,cf9ul2y,2,t5_2x1l2

3319797,0,t1_cp5yyg9,and actually come to think of it I do recall an incident a few years ago  It was a kid  male  I had been walking my dog in the park had flip flops on it being summer  Dog is a German Shepard Mutt hes got the Shepard coloring amp body his head is more like a lab big floppy ears.  Anyways this group of boys sees me walking the dog  call to me ask if they can pet him hes super friendly so I say sure amp walk him over.  Theyre petting him and chatting with me for several minutes when  finally noticed the polish on my toes.  Asked why I had polish on my toes.I responded with its just something I like to do for fun from time to time   One of the other boys spoke up with a Yeah I do that occasionally too.The original who spotted the toes at that point said ugh  get away from me man.  I just shrugged amp went back to my walk.   ,malepolish,cp6ooj9,3,t5_2x1l2
3374981,0,t3_2y2w7a,I would also like to note in this same vain. WASH YOUR HANDS VERY THOROUGHLY. Oil is usually the cause of nail polish chipping too early. Cleanse very very thoroughly first. Good post though OP very few people know how to cut nails properly. ,malepolish,cpcz123,2,t5_2x1l2

4281317,0,t1_cs79i2s,An hour isnt very long and it looks like youve got multiple coats there. Id wait at least  minutes to half an hour between coats. What youve got going on there is definitely polish that hasnt dried properly so however long youre waiting wait longer.  Also youre using a top coat right? You need a top coat. ,malepolish,cs881st,1,t5_2x1l2

11677547,0,t3_65cxa5,Matte finish does seem to break faster than glossy ones. not sure whyHave you tried putting a clear coat under the matte finish? Itll even out the bumps and generally make your nails look neater.,malepolish,dgjo049,2,t5_2x1l2
