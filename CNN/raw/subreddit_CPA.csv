7793039,0,t3_4lzml0,The exam is the same for the entire United States so it doesnt matter in which state you take it. However select states have attitudinal requirements that you should research. I would do hardeasyhardeasy for the exams. That differs based on each person. The pass rates from hardest to easiest are audit far reg and BEC. Note BEC will change a lot come . I would not recommend taking far and reg in the same quarter to much material. I would do the following order. Far and BEC  quarter and reg and AUD another quarter. I found far is by far  no pun intended the hardest. Im  right now waiting on far,CPA,d3rzuks,1,t5_2rlkk
