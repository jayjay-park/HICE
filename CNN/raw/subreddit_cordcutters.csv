17338,0,t1_cbaoybe,I have an MK as well running Android . with Finless custom . custom ROM. Microstutter is a thing of the past using the stock video player. The stock software is garbage lots of wifi drops and video playback issues. Putting the custom ROM on cured that. I have read elsewhere that the stock app titled video with a reel like icon actually uses hardware decoding and has many features. The MK has a decent following and there are at least two actively developed ROMS for it. I dont imagine youd see Cyanogen or any big names like that developing for Android TV sticks in the near future. The MK can be had for as little as  on Amazon so I would give it a shot. I use it between work and home both with locally loaded p files and Netflix from Playstore works well and Youtube from the play store. The MK also comes fully rooted verified using SU with full permissions unlike some other devices. No issues with side loading. All of Finless ROMs including . spoof the device as a Samsung GSIII so that there is virtually no app you cannot download. Hope this helps...,cordcutters,cegeoe6,1,t5_2sa6y

A remote is a communal and easy to use device.

They didnt even show the replay in primetime only a replay of the shootout.  As a hockey fan I was absolutely disgusted in how Hockey was treated.  Im sure they didnt show games simply because International Hockey rules dictate that there cannot be breaks between periods so NBC was probably like ooh we cant show another McDonalds ad BETTER STICK WITH FIGURE SKATINGSaturday after the US beat Russia i looked at the TV lineup for later in the day pm and saw NBC Hockey Game of the Week which I assumed would be USA v Russia.  Nope FUCKING CZECH VS LATVIA WOOPTY FUCKING DOO.  Way to know your own market NBC.   Not only that but one of the mornings when I woke up before work I used my iOS device using NBCs olympic app to catch some of the USA vs Slovenia game.  As a noncable subscriber I was provided with a min trial.  Oh cool lets give this a whirl if I like it maybe Ill sign up to watch the rest of the olympics.  The video loads and there is an ad on top no big deal.  minutes later BAM FUCKING UNANNOUNCED second COMMERCIAL.  Well look at that USA just scored and I missed it because of a fucking commercial didnt click anything but was still forced to sit through it all while it counted against my min trial.  Shit happens whatever Ill keep watching this feed. NOOOOOOOPE  minutes later IT HAPPENED AGAIN all while TeamUSA scored again.  FUCK THIS APP.  Closed it down and used a backdoor stream to watch the rest of the game which lacked the quality had some popups but went uninterrupted.  No fucking way I wouldve paid to use that app for  weeks my expectation was that those interruptions would continuously happen.

So given that we go from  an episode to...  per  hours of  minute videos to at minimum of  of the  minute episodes. This would just be for ONE DAY. Now lets take this a bit further and assume we dont like to watch the same reruns day to day. so that    per day of  hour viewing becomes    per week of  minute   minute episodes respectively.So depending on whether you are watching Pokemon or Game of Thrones  time span wise  you are paying between  and  for  hours of viewing unique content.

Use a compass app on a smartphone to help determine the correct direction.If available you can use existing unused satellite or cable TV coax cable runs in your dads home to connect the antenna to your TVs.  Just go outside and disconnect the cable feed from the splitter.  If you have cable broadband internet use a coupler couple bucks to reconnect the feed to the cable modem.  The more splitter outlets you have splitting off the main connection the more likely you might need an amplifier.If you currently have cable TV service you can call them up and ask if theyll come and install more cable TV connections for free with the anticipation that youll be getting TVs soon.  After theyve installed the connections disconnect the cable TV service.  Thats what I did.  ,cordcutters,cgh11jj,1,t5_2sa6y

The reason you dont want to set someone else up with an HTPC is that it requires constant maintenance. Updates must be applied and problems must be troubleshooted. A lot more can go wrong with an HTPC than a streaming box. You have to like doing that kind of tinkering and you have to really understand what all the parts of your system do. Its something you set up for yourself. For somebody else its a big confusing chore.I think a Tivo is probably the easiest allinone solution if they also want to watch live TV.

MythTV will automatically select the right antenna depending upon channel selected for live or recorded TV. The  antenna system is one of the huge advantages of MythTV and given the compass for Tulsa plus extra tuners are always nice.   With that said your large antenna should be able to pick up a number of those stations.

Its about copyright not about technical access.gt Not the same as actual OTA which is different and will have difference outages. So your example makes no sense as it is not the same.Aereo isnt OTA however. Aereo takes OTA manipulates it then retransmits it to you. The judgement of the Court has been that whether youre doing this with a oneonone basis for each customer or doing on a oneformany basis for all your customers its legally the same thing.gtThe cable companies have the right to set up  million antennas.Yes but this judgement says they cant do that in order to circumvent retransmission fees.gtWhat if aereo rents an all in one device that is an antenna solar panel battery and dvr that they place on your roofjust like a satellite installer that connects to your wifi and you never have to touch it? If it breaks they come and fix it or replace it.That would be legal. Then theyd basically be renting a Slingbox to you. Since its a tool theyre providing for your private use it doesnt qualify them as an MVPD.gtIf these are legal than aereo as it was yesterday is legal.Except what you descried and what Aereo was doing arent the same. Aereo was providing a service which gave you access to video streams much like a cable provider not providing you with a tool that you could utilize to access material youre already licensed to access like a TV set or radio.gtThe supreme court said aereo was illegal because the service is perceived the same as a community antenna.Well it does function like one.gtBut both the things I just stated would also be perceived the same as normal cable or normal aereo.No not your selfcontained box. In the selfcontainedbox situation Aereo is not receiving signals and passing them on. In that situation you the consumer are receiving the signal and it stays entirely within your private network. Your selfcontainedbox is more like a VCR than what Aereo was doing since Aereo had to retransmit signals over the Internet.,cordcutters,cigvn46,1,t5_2sa6y

Is Ryan Block  in the right?First off Comcast has incentivescommission for employees of their customer retention department. A lot of times it can mean the difference of getting bills paid rent food etc to get that one customer to stay. Just listen to the reps voice. Thats not the sound of an Ahole who just doesnt want to listen to anything the customer says. Thats actually the sound of desperation and fear. When I hear that I can only feel sorry for the guy. So most of my blame goes to Comcast for their horrible policies and commission procedures.Lastly I dont think Ryan Block is all that innocent. He knew exactly what he was doing to the rep. He could have just easily answered the question instead of setting the guy up for failure like that. He knew the rep would be trying his hardest to retain him as a customer but thats his job. Thats what pay the bills and brings food to the table. ,cordcutters,cj63744,1,t5_2sa6y

1732754,0,t1_cjxjt3a,Your assessment of SSL providing privacy is correct.  I was more getting at the claim in the advisory that adding SSL will address MITM attacks it wont.  The plaintext issue being brought up in the advisory deals with access to the App Store clientserver communication already has available SSL wrapping  from the advisory  The Plex Media Server offers HTTPS access via TCP port   This however isnt going to prevent MITM  most users get the this is a new certificate! warning and just click OK when browsing the web I doubt theyd behave any differently here.  However it sounds like youre different than the average user so it might help you.  HMAC would give us endtoend communications that we knew werent modified as long as the key hadnt been stolen from the server or the client Im talking about the App Store here regardless of cleartext or encrypted transmission.  And...users never have to see it which is the main reason I was suggesting it.  It does nothing for privacy though.  As for the marketing issues I agree with you that its misleading.  The default configuration has people putting an authentication channel and video stream unprotected on the Internet for everyone to see.  Maybe a caveat saying we recommend implementing a VPN?  I wonder if STunnel runs on embedded devices yet  its been a while since I looked at it.

Cell phone service providers or if you want another example Railways. Huge cost to entry very limited amount of people that can even afford to consider competing in that space.

In fact there wouldnt even BE a Tmobile if the government hadnt stepped in a few years ago. Again with the mental gymnastics. You refuse to acknowledge an obvious fact that barrier to entry is a huge deterrent for competition. You refuse to acknowledge that its more practical and better for society when we dont have telephone poles every two feet. And finally your own goddamn example is a completely ridiculous. Youre going to accuse me of not trying? Ok do me a favor and go sign a contract with Appalachian Wireless drive to Michigan and tell me how the service is. If anybodys time is being wasted its mine.

Radio is more talking and music TV is more story telling.TV didnt kill radio as they both serve a different function. But Netflix is television television which the user can decide what to watch and when to watch. Linear television is more like radio in the sense that youre given a stream of content that you have no control over.I think Netflix has the potential to severely wound TV but not kill it entirely. TV still has some content which Netflix doesnt have and probably never will get..and thats firstrun shows and sports.Netflix can kill off many of the channels which no one gives a shit about..the ones that only survive through forced bundling.TV execs have to wake up to the fact that people are fed up paying  for  channels when they only watch....

Ive seen communications from them in the past and they are generally a great deal more professional sounding than that one.  Id dig deeper before handing over credit card info to this new replacement service for USTVNow.  Just my ..As to the OP both have advantages.  USTVNow has more channels but there are a few missing from it that are on Slingand of course naturally vice versa.  The upgrade on USTVNow goes up a cliff after the base package that price for all the thingsYowza! and Sling is more granular but again even with added channels there are still things USTVNow can do that Sling cant and again vice versa such as Sling offering limited Ondemand for several channels.USTVNow also has an edge with DVR and two streams compared to Slings one.The only thing is that USbased users accessing USTVNow has always felt like a gray area whether it is or not and their own terms of service seems to prohibit USbased users from taking advantage of the service.  They dont do anything to enforce this however.Basically take a look at whats available what youll get what youll be missing from each and go from there.

Also for Sling tv compare cost of sling tv Latino versus Sling tv  the  add on packs in Spanish one for sports and one for standard Spanish channels in U.S.. Pricing works out differently.I would use the  off the first Roku  offer from sling tv.Link Use this for the first Roku. I think the boxes are better in general. More powerful. Especially for sling tv.For the second Roku you can use this  off staples coupon if your local staples store has Roku boxes in store.  This is for this holiday weekend sale so check expiration date.  If your local store sells a winegard flatwave antenna flat white box should be where Roku boxes are you should pick up one of those too. Dont get the metro one. You can go to the store order these items on the kiosk but pay at the register to use the in store coupon if they dont happen to have any in stockmIf you want a longer trials of service on any of the streaming services you can buy one or more Roku through Roku to get the Roku special offers.Finally check Best buy for any sales today for streaming boxes.

Want to find something new? If scrolling through the popular section is really that bad just google. Theres built in results on the top of google and a million pages showing the best on netflix. Navigating channels on a cable box is pure torture. The waits for things to come up in the on demand section are intolerable. I would rather have to go through a dvd binder than go back to that.Im sorry I just dont agree with your post. You say theres something to be said for curation but I have no clue what that could possibly mean. Channels arent curated. They are just shows on that channel. If you want curated content just go to the category youre looking for. No one is forcing you to look for  minutes every time. If anything its the immediate availability of a larger volume of BETTER content that youre complaining about. Thats crazy talk. You typically hear that most cordcutters say that they watch less but of a higher quality. While that may be desirable for some there are quite a large number of people out there that dont want that experience. Holy crap just pick a show.

If it drops to g speed constantly it is no good. You will need to have a hotspot and if that isnt allowed under the terms of service you could have your account shut down. For example with Verizons unlimited data plan you need to pay about  extra a month for hotspot yes I know there are apps...Finally you need to think out your plan for streaming if it involves a tv.  I would strongly suggest you test whatever set up you plan to use in advance.That said if you really want to do this here are some ways to save data and your cell phoneIf you use Amazon Prime get a cheap Fire tablet so you can download prime content and instant video over WiFi elsewhere for later viewing.If you use Vudu do the same. Maybe possible for iTunes and Play too??Use Hoopla if your library supports it and has WiFi so you can download copies of tvmovies for later viewing on your tablet.Change the video resolution in Netflix and other similar services to a lower video quality.Consider using the local library or Netflix DVD or red box for dvdsReduce the number of times your phone updates for Facebook email etc to help save battery life.Figure out a way to have an offline media library that does not need to use your cell phoneGet an antenna and dvr probably a mediasonic homeworx so it can go directly to tv.Switch to an iPod or mp player instead of streaming music.You will need to be flexible and understand that there will be tradeoffs you need to make for this to be successful.,cordcutters,cwhnff6,3,t5_2sa6y

You might want to run it again to see if that makes a significant difference.You have signals coming from two major directions. I will address each direction separatelySoutheastIf you pointed a UHF band capable antenna southeast then you could expect to get NBC ABC Fox and PBS as WCV is transmitting NBC note the absence of CBS The signals are spread out over an arc so a  bay UHF antenna would be good here. Examples Solid Signal HDBX AKA Digiwave ANT AKA Stellar Labs  Channel Master CMHD Antennas Direct DBeWestIf you pointed a VHFhigh band capable antenna a bit south of due west you could expect to get CBS NBC ABC CW and Fox note that they are packed into only two transmitters real ch   so the quality would probably be lower This antenna would probably work well for you for that direction Stellar Labs General discussionYou can choose either direction. Because you are lucky enough to have the two directions in two different bands you can even put up both antennas and combine them with a device called a UVSJ.

5963241,0,t3_3x4122,They can put anything they want into your lease contract doesnt make it legal or enforceable.IANAL but my understanding of the law is the same as you  They cant enforce that clause.  I know this is a fact when it comes to preventing you from using or installing a reasonably sized dish or antenna setup although they can dictate WHERE said dish goes and I believe it fully applies to Cable  DSL  Phone etc as well.Your BEST bet is to find a lawyer who is competent in similar cases pay the  to have him draft up a letter on his letterhead stating theyre in violation of the law etc.  Some lawyers will even do this for free and only bill you if you have to go further EG take them to court.As a side note  Even though they are AFAIK in the wrong you dont want to try and hide your use of another provider.  They cant STOP you from doing so but they can and likely will find any way they can to burn you for it if you get caught.  Best bet is to state your intent via the aforementioned lawyer and DOCUMENT EVERYTHING.  Damage to your apartment what the installer has to do any new holes etc.Rarely will it go to court most PM companies hope that their tenants are ignorant of their rights and just pay whatever the landlord says.  If it comes to it fight them FYI Google Renters rights  your location usually legal letterhead is more than enough.EDIT  Regarding dishes and antenna  Those fall under the FCC OTARD rules a quick skim seems to indicate that cabledsl are not covered under those particular rules.,cordcutters,cy1b8e0,1,t5_2sa6y

Itd be one thing if the content creators were frustrated with current distribution methods as many musicians were but as the industry consolidates I don think they see much reason to allow apple in and can do a lot on their own through their own websites to make the streaming experience enjoyable.

Regarding the total First thanks so much for including the screenshot! Ok so I think whats happening is that Marchs Total is ONLY showing you what youll pay in March at the moment. So that would be FIOS. Netflix still hasnt paid for the current month February so its not included yet but will be on February th and Sling TV doesnt update again until April so its not included in March.So with that in mind...what do you think? It obviously confused you so with the explanation I gave you what would be better for you? I ask this because we went backandforth on how to handle this but decided wed rather just kick it out there and see what people actually wanted!Thanks so much again for your feedback!,cordcutters,d00tiu6,3,t5_2sa6y

Theres an attitude where a Japanese product just has to do well in Japan and everyone else is an afterthought if theyre though of at all. Anime is mostly a product of foreign companies importing it rather than Japan exporting it. Even Nintendo wanted Atari to market the NES in the US rather than doing it themselves. Atari was such a mess at the time they werent able to capitalize on itThis attitude leads to a lot of Japanese movies that probably would have been worldwide successes but are relatively unknown outside of Japan fetishists.

7172953,0,t3_4dd7bk,Hi sacheltry and thank you for purchasing a Winegard antenna!Wind can definitely play an issue in reception especially if it is moving branches or leaves around between your antenna and the signal. I would also recommend because of your description of it sitting in the corner looking at how you have the antenna mounted in the attic and in which direction it is pointed.From the TV Fool report it would seem that you would be able to receive WPIX. I would recommend contacting Winegard customer service at helpwinegard.com and they may be able to walk you through some steps to help pick that up.Yes installing an antenna on the roof can make a large difference in your signal levels.

Or should a person working  hour weeks have most of his income seized so he cant afford to even have cable TV and forced to walk to work all in the name of equality?With increased effort comes increase in compensation.

Currently the median monthly data usage by our residential customers is approximately    GB.What was Comcast saying back in ?gt In  we announced an Internet data usage policy that allowed residential customers up to  GB of data usage per month. It was widely recognized that this was far above any normal including very heavy residential use of our highspeed data service and in fact that remains the case today.I especially love this whining amongst all the marketspeakgt Weve also always said that we would evaluate customer usage and a variety of other factors and make adjustments as the marketplace evolved. Please see our FAQs and a Venture Beat story on this topic Over the last several years we have periodically reviewed this policy and for the last six months we have been analyzing the market and our process and think that now is the time to begin to move to a new plan. gtThis conclusion was only reinforced when in recent weeks some of the conversation around our new product introductions focused on our data usage threshold rather than on the exciting opportunities we are offering our customers.ltRead Guyyyzzzzzz!

7501659,0,t1_d2usosk,K UHD has four times the pixels of p but HEVC is twice as efficient as H. same subjective quality at half the bitrate. Therefore a K UHD video encoded in HEVC would be twice the file size of an equivalent p video not quadruple.I agree that p looks pretty damn good already at typical viewing distances. I dont see a reason to upgrade the p  plasma in the living room. But on my  p computer monitor I do notice a difference with resolutions above p because the viewing distance is so much closer about a foot away. So I think the resolution increase of K matters for displays closer to your eyes VR headsets and computer monitors and for very large displays home projection and theater projection. For normal size TVs at typical viewing distances I think K UHD is largely a waste except for more noticeable changes like wide color gamut HDR and high frame rate that happen to be included alongside K.

8266659,0,t3_4skwft,Your best bet is to just try another ideally larger antenna.  You have CBS Fox  and NBC coming from the NorthWest and ABC coming from the NorthEast.  ABC is your weakest station so ideally you would position the antenna for that direction and hope the stronger stations come from the side of the antenna.  But you may have to compromise somehow finding the best reception for all.  Otherwise you would need a rotator or two antennas to tune in the best reception.You want a VHFUHF designed antenna.  NBC is on VHFHi.   Most leafflatstyle antennas arent designed for VHF.  Antenna options rabbit ears  loop RCA ANTF indoor Winegard FlatWave or indooroutdoorattic Winegard FreeVision both available at Home Depot and easily returnable outdoorattic Antennas Direct Element or outdoorattic Winegard HDP best.  Your optimal direction is NorthEast.The optimal location for an indoor antenna is in a window or ideally for your location a NorthEastNorthNorthWest facing window.  If one of the above indoor antennas doesnt work as well then try one of their amplified versions RCA ANTF amplified Winegard FlatWave or Winegard FreeVision  preamp Winegard LNALNA or RCATVPRAMPR.If it were me and I didnt have an existing satellite Jmount for a Winegard FreeVision or Antennas Direct Element pointing NorthEast then I would probably go for a Winegard HDP in the attic shared between all the existing coax cables in the house.  The larger the antenna that will fit in your attic the better.  Check the antenna specs and measure the boom length and element widths in your attic to be sure it will fit when pointing in your optimal direction.See this post for more information on connecting an antenna using existing unused coax cables and sharing a single indooroutdoorattic antenna between multiple TVsDVRs.  The same applies to satellite coax cable runs or sharing an antenna in an upstairs room.  Only difference is where youre mountingconnecting your antenna.  This is something you can do yourself if the cables are within easy reach but you can also hire a satellite installer who is willing to install antennas.,cordcutters,d5aw1po,2,t5_2sa6y

So to offset the loss you would jack up the price  so you raise prices to . Now you have k people paying    million.Because you raised prices you lose another  people. Now you have  people paying   . You would have had  million if you didnt raise prices. Now I know what youre thinking why the fuck would I assume that raising prices by  would cost them so many customers? Note that it has to be that raising prices costs profit because if it didnt they would have done it in the first place. Consider the case where raising prices by  only costs Bell  people. In that case when initially setting their price at  they have a decision to make Do they want to charge  and have  customers or  and get a million? Since you make .million more with the former they obviously would do that. Given that they chose not to do that it must cost them more than k people.One slightly more nuanced argument I would entertain is that the price increase is because the  they lost are the most price sensitive. The people that stayed are the people that value cable the most. But in that case it still has nothing to do with greed. They were charging as much as they could before and still are. I dont really buy that argument though because k isnt really that many people in a market this size.

8352576,0,t1_d5ld1e1,Exclusive original content is their lifeblood and future. Hulu locked down all the streaming rights with your basic cable and network shows. HBO and Netflix thrive because of their growing catelog of quality shows. Theyre building out for a lot of different niche audiences and genres. Over time this will make them a powerhouse because theyll be less and less dependent on streaming contracts with greedy production houses. Amazon Prime HBO Netflix and now even Hulu are realizing that the only way to gain negotiating power is by becoming less dependent on third party content. The demand decreases the prices drop we get more third party content AND original content in the long run.Its like if you got into the housing industry. Youre going to make more money by buying properties and renting them out than leasing properties and renting them out to only get a fraction of the profit. As time goes on theyll gobble up more and more properties and have more and more to offer.One final point dumping money into original content increases their access to star power. HBO did the same thing. Theyre providing careers and developing actors and its creating brand loyalty. As the stars get bigger theyre thrown into more new series as the older shows wrap up.

8391312,0,t3_4uehaz,Ive been using HDHomerun setup with Raspberry pis for a year or  now but I just recently purchased a fire tv and nvidia shield during Prime day a few weeks ago. I have a xb ps chromecast as well as decent array of streaming apps on my  samsung lcd.Its kind of a pain in the ass to navigate which apps work on which device and which internet provider. Im looking at you comcast  Right now? Im really digging the NV Shield pro. It really is lightning quick. I do love the built in chromecast with the shield. It solves one of the more stupid problems with comcast blocking me activating hbo go on it.  I have NO idea why this is legal. It sure as hell shouldnt be. Get this I cant use the hbo go app on the shield BUT i can use my iphone to connect to the chromecast on it.  boggle  I spent a majority of my tv consumption this weekend by streaming youtubes from phone to shield. Live concerts and stuff mostly.  It loads and plays them SO much faster than any other device I have. You can cast your plex library like this as well if you desire. Also there is an Amazon Video apk for nv shield floating around if you look.  Fire TV is pretty nice. I have it setup on my bedroom tv. I dont have the hbo go activation bullshit blocking my app on there since amazon and comcast did whatever deal they had to do make it happen and it generally handles most of my content ok.  It CANNOT handle MPG interlaced streams like oh from my HD HOMERUN ffs worth a crap however. It plays them but it looks pretty shitty compared to hw decoding from Raspberry pis or shieldpc.  Right now this is a pretty big problem for me since I use the hd homerun a LOT. Im heavily considering switching to ps vue for my service but the app snafu rears its ugly head once more. I can only load the psvue app on my ps fire tv but not the shield yet. I seriously cannot believe how much of a headache all this is to figure out.,cordcutters,d5qgmff,2,t5_2sa6y

See the top four or five lines in the tablechart  notice how they have a red tinge in the green section? She is practically on top of the towers for those four channels. If there is an amplifier remove it. If it cant or there isnt one try either the unamplified winegard flatwave or mini flatwave from Amazon from Home depot . You can try regular rabbit ears with a loop...plain kind that are under .If it wont freak her out she could get most if not all of her green channels by using a paperclip that is straightened out as an antenna.

Have them think about what shows they watch and what networks they are on. This will help in determining what plan to choose. Vue does have a  day free trial. One thing they could do is to use it on the highest package Elite and see what channels they could do without. One downside though is that the cloud DVR is limited to a  day viewing window after air date. Depending on what network and show after those  days the episode could be available as On Demand or Catch Up. These would have limited viewing options i.e. no fast forward. As far as a recommended device to use I would have them go with an Amazon Fire TV box not stick. Getting past Amazons tendency to bombard you with their content on the home screen it will give a stable full experience of Vue even with the familiar guide. They can also access Netflix YouTube and many other streaming apps.Also unless the gigabit deal is just too good to pass up you can have them drop to just basic Comcast internet. Each concurrent stream only requires around mb. I pay  for the Perfomance mbps and can run Vue of  devices at a time with no problem.Might have to call to force them to tell you what deals are in your area. Have them get their own modem and router to avoid the equipment rental fee.With a combination of an internet only cable package and Vues basic plan you could easily cut their bill by over half.,cordcutters,d6yl3vk,3,t5_2sa6y

It is essentially about a girl Eleven who has special powers that enable her to kill people even across continents apparently. She was kidnapped ? from her real mom and used in experiments by the US govt ? as a weapon. Apparently doing all of this tomfoolery has opened up some kind of a portal to a dark and gloomy other dimension ? where a monster or many monsters? live. These monsters can also come and go from the real world at will to eat humans and other animals. This top secret facility is in a small town called Hawkins for some reason and not in the lowest levels of the Pentagon or some other secure facility. The police chief of Hawkins waltzes in to the facility with little to no resistance as well. Somehow that same US govt facility has the ability to make a perfect looking clone of the missing boy but then they fill him with goose feathers. Again the police chief is able to waltz into the morgue and find this out.I just didnt like it as much as I hoped I would like it.

There is probably another one inside the house. It was probably used because the installer didnt want to drill another hole in the house. If you want to continue to use it for some reason remember that it will block TV signals on the Sat side.If the unused cable was left open to the weather on the end you might want to use the other one in case water got into the cable and is still there.

9218519,0,t3_56m8f0,Check out our guides as already mentioned. I am a big fan of Roku boxes but given that you want to watch football one suggestion I would make is consider the new Fire TV stick or the Fire TV for one tv. The reason for this is that many people watch football on Vue or use Twitter to watch the free Thursday night games that are now available. Only those Thursday night games that are on the NFL network itself and not Twitter are in Vue and Sling TV so having an app on the tv would be really handy.  I do recommend having at least two different devices if you have more than one tv because some services are not on all devices. For example Roku does not have a Twitter app and with Twitter getting NFL and other sports this can be a handy app. Pick the services first and then the devices. I recommend consider PlayStation Vue because it allows for  concurrent streams and has a virtual DVR. Sling TV Blue would also be ideal but you would need to add Sling TV Orange for some football games.  The combo of both Sling TV packages is . However you can cancel at any time so if you dont want ESPN and Disney the rest of the year you can cancel Orange for those months.Definitely look at an antenna. Go to TVfool.com and generate a report to see what channels you can get. Post your report if you want recommendations. Check these websites to find other internet fixed wireless satellite or municipal internet options available         Note that Comcast has expanded its data caps. See last weeks posts for a list of locations.  You will want to find Comcasts approved modem list before buying a modem as you need to find a model on that list. ,cordcutters,d8kijpv,1,t5_2sa6y

Another angle is the obscene amount of commercials involved in NFL football. There is a litteraly a commercial break every  minutes lasting  minutes each. They created the tv timeout so they could fit in more commercials. Shit is catching up to the league as more and more people become intolerant of commercials. Lastly the NFL is taking itself entirely too seriously as of late. Any hint of celebration by players results in a penalty. Theyve almost forgot that this is a game and its here for entertainment.

People always say my landlord doesnt allow us to place an antenna on the outside of the building and well unfortunately for your landlord they may be breaking the law. Under certain circumstances there are cases where no one is allowed to stop you from installing and using an antenna or dish for television.

I wonder if they just reference each others articles versus coming up with something original.The best part of the skinny  OTT bundles is simply they exist and provide a different type of competition.  The growth of the traditional streaming services of Netflix  Amazon  Hulu along with the OTT cable alternative services simply allow us as consumers to pick and choose what we want.  Most of these articles keep trying to put us into some neat little category and presume we are all going to purchase similar things.  Instead we all can pick and choose what we want us  Netflix  Amazon  Hulu  with Starz amp HBO a couple times per year and that is it.  Others I know go with something as simple as SlingTV and Netflix while a couple we know have Netflix and OTA.  Choice is grand  and the ability to change what we subscribe to in a few minutes is even better.,cordcutters,dbuxece,2,t5_2sa6y

10202793,0,t1_dc0f5to,Is the antenna connected directly to the HDHomeRun or are there splitters in between?Are you saying youre experiencing pixelation on NBC or commenting on the signal ratings?Did you order a preamp or a distribution amplifier powered splitter?Generally speaking youll always get better results with a higher gainlarger antenna or repositioning the antenna for the best reception.  Your optimal direction is SouthSoutheast but try slight variations to find a sweet spot.If that isnt possible then a preamp is your next best bet.  A preamp can only boost the signal it already receives up to a level that the tuner prefers which is why a higher gainlarger antenna is generally better.  You also want to be careful in over boosting the stations with strong signals or you could end up with reception issues for those channels.Unfortunately trial and error is involved at some locations.,cordcutters,dc0jky3,2,t5_2sa6y

10252349,0,t1_dc63sdh,Im willing to bet that its part of the reason people fall for the HDTV Antenna scams even if they have an old antenna from the s laying around.  They simply dont know that any antenna will work to receive television signals including a paperclip if youre close enough to the towers. Im perfectly fine with an antenna because thats how I grew up but in the space where I used to get  channels on a good day I now get  channels reliably with no issues.  I cant pick up iON and one PBS affiliate nor some religious channels that I have absolutely no interest in but everything else comes in perfectly fine and clear.  The bad part about the conversion to ATSC from NTSC is the phenomenon known as a digital cliff instead of a gradual rolloff.  On ATSC this wouldnt even come in but with NTSC it still comes in and is still watchable.  With the ATSC standard everything is either  clear or nothing will come on at all.  While this is good for areas that are in close proximity to the towers or if you have a large enough antenna the propagation with the ATSC standard isnt as far as it was with NTSC.  Yes I filmed that video on my livingroom TV.The only reason I have cable TV now is because its free with the rent so I dont have to pay for it.  But if it werent included Id just use my antenna that I already have set up.  In fact I actually set up my antenna on day  before I even checked to see if the cable was on yet.  Then I remembered  days later of oh yeah free cable and set up an AB switch so I could switch between sources.    I actually get subchannels OTA that the local analog cable system does not carry if I rented a box it would but Im not going to rent a box.  Channels such as GritTV Heroes and Icons AntennaTV This!TV and Justice TV are only available OTA in my location.  Right now I have Mr Belvedere sitcom from the late s on and Im getting it on the OTA channel AntennaTV.  This channel isnt even available on the cable system.,cordcutters,dc65rr3,1,t5_2sa6y

I have taken it out of the mix to test before but over all my connection to most channels seem to be better with it then without. Next time I do see the skips and jitters I will try and pull it and test the signal strength with the CM DVR which has a decent tool that shows strength and quality when tuned to the channel. ,cordcutters,ddbkasz,1,t5_2sa6y

Ill try and verify I can watch a channel that has noise on the HDHomeRun and then verify conditions on the TV. Im unfamiliar with too high of signal strength which seems counter intuitive. But... Im certainly not an expert in this field. Ill try and add the splitter and see if I can measure a drop in signal strength and determine if that helps with the choppy channels.

10671856,0,t3_5sow3x,Helps to find a home with coax runs.  Nice if its done neatly with an antenna in mind.  As for Internet it can be roughly centralized using WiFi if you dont have the Cat runs throughout the home.  There are many options for OTA DVR.  I use a Tablo which implies a frontend at each TV which could be the Smart TV itself... but IMHO youre better off with Roku.  Nice part about a network DVR like Tablo is that you can use it pretty much everywhere though end devices need to be at least paired with the Tablo on the local network before going remote e.g. your phone or tablet.Of course some can live without the OTA piece and just use SlingTV and ESPN through that.  All depends on what you can live without.  We use SlingTV because of Hallmark channel.  But having ESPN is a bonus.  To be honest we dont use the rest on it.  But we record a lot of OTA using the Tablo.  Then I move the media off the Tablo to our Plex server for long term use if needed.Oh while Tablo makes TV and DVR anywhere possible its not designed for channel surfing fast channel changes.... which is why the antenna runs to every TV is sort of important too.,cordcutters,ddgpywd,1,t5_2sa6y

11183400,0,t1_dezkgk1,if you are a ham radio operator then you should understand that your signals are really bad and at most at  feet you might maybe if you are lucky get half a dozen channels even with a big antenna and a strong amp.I have a Clearstream v and I have a xtreme signal  bay and I have a small yagi antenna and I have a large four bay antenna I built myself.. I run the yagi pointed at baltimore and the bay at philly. I also use two db amps on them and I am  miles out in each direction from those markets. I get signals that are much better than yours but half my stations are in the single digits and I can get the stations but now I have a local miles away broadcaster on vhf  that is interfering with my setup so its thrown me out of wack.anything under nmdb is off and on you cant depend on it.. anything under zero nmdb is basically a happy gift if the stars align right.. but you most likely wont get Fox and you most likely wont get anything under PBS .. you have one market at  magnetic and the top group you might get but thats about itThat will give you abc cbs and probably a bunch of foreign language stations. You can try to do this if you look at this as a hobby type experience  just to have fun .. but for television watching I am not sure you are going to be happy. A large yagi may help over a bay but bays are optimized for UHF  they give a wider area of dipoles so they do pretty well when put up against a big yagi. My antenna probably gets me between  and  db of gain .. then i have a CM boosting that db and then i have a CM distribution amp bumping it up about db per drop  and I have problems getting a UHF  that tvfool says I am getting . nmdb to my area.I understand your situation.. but I just have to be honest with you.. Yes get a bay and a cm it will get you UHF  and above.. a few stations.. mount it as high as you can and feet can make a difference.. but dont expect to get a full lineup of stations.. You might... but its very unlikely unless you can get that antenna higher and height is your only problem not that the towers are shaping their broadacast signals in the opposite direction from you.go to www.rabbitears.info and sometimes if you click on technical info on a station it will have their broadcast cloud and you can tell if it is pointing away from you or towards you.good luck If you have questions maybe I can help.. maybe,cordcutters,dezmj41,1,t5_2sa6y

11497174,0,t1_dfz6hbn,gt It covers any data going through an ISP independent of contracts.Nope that is false. This is basic contract law.gt Essentially ISPs cant throttle or block a specific service and must treat all data going through them the same. In so far as the ISP has agreed to do that in their contract with customers sure. However the ISP tends to have a clause where they can change the contract at any time and an arbitration clause. So that is wrong.gt They have to throttle the whole connection independent of the source of data if they need to throttle for performance reasons.There where a few cases where ISPs were selectively respecting or ignoring the packet prioritization headers. As a result they were sued by the upstream nd and rd party  network peers for breach of network neutrality clause in a contract. The result was that if a network operator respected some prioritization fields of packets they had to honor all of them. The effect was chilling and almost over night ALL network operators stopped honoring prioritization headers. The problem was that anybody could set higher prioritization on their packets and many bad actors did exactly that where some legitimate actors did not. Network operators had a kind of BOGONS list of bad actors and would simply not prioritize those packets. Well that practice is now over. gt What this means at a high level is an ISP cant use their position as a gateway to their customers to extort fees from services or throttle specific services to give other or their own services an advantage.But that is a consumer protection perspective and really has nothing to do with back bone Internet network operations where Net Neutrality makes any sense. Why you ask? Because ISP customers are not network peers. You as a customer are not exchanging packets with other network operators and youre not privy to network neutrality clauses in your contract because you are a rd party.Once again Network neutrality is not a consumer protection topic. What you are talking about is a real issue... its not to be conflated with network neutrality.I will take this one step farther and talk about how the people amp FCC have misappropriated terminology. Take for example BROADBAND. What do you think that means? Ill give you a hint its totally nothing to do with BASEBAND which covers digital signaling like Ethernet or ADSL or DOCSIS.... oh wait those are all signal protocols actually used for ISP lastmile hookup today. The point Im trying to make is perhaps the FCC and people like you have tried to change the meaning of these words to fit whatever you assume they mean. ,cordcutters,dfz7d1a,0,t5_2sa6y

11806207,0,t1_dgy23p3,I always disliked Bright Houses customer service but I paid for top end internet service and it seemed to always work. Now with Spectrum my internet consistently cuts out all day and gets slower during peak hours to the point that online gaming is impossible. I pay  a month just for Internet and cant get working Internet in a very residential area. Unfortunately where I live there is no one else that will provide high speed internet. Im very likely going to move because of this issue. ,cordcutters,dgy9vw2,8,t5_2sa6y
