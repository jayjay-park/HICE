164131,0,t3_1vz11s,Hi guys Im hoping to make this sub a little more active and was wondering whats your take on the misdemeanors this article talks about. Personally I really like an equal amount of feet to cap and I like having my feet line up to the top and not spread out from under the cap but Ive found that to be pretty hard to achieve. Over and underfilling dont bother me as much as weak shells that dent or crack under simple handling  ,macarons,cex4kxk,2,t5_2uv6t
