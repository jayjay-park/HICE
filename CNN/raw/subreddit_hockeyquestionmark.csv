Why didnt you accuse Dyal of overstepping his bounds when the same process was used last season?Also the modification to the process was a modification in the VOTING PROCESS after we opened the process to voting SOMETHING THAT WAS NOT DONE IN PREVIOUS SEASONS.

Your suggestion of making casters count saves is absolutely retarded and shows how little you know about stat tracking and the complexity of casting.  The casters never know whether or not a save was made our if the shots was wide and consistently misannounce saves in their cast.

But isnt . closer to subrosa using a largely different code? Would he be giving up that much of subrosa if he sold the source code of the older version of the game? I know nothing about programming or game developing so please forgive my ignorance. Also I would like to lament the distance between the European community and the North American one as really combining the two somehow should be in everyones interest whod like to grow the game. But without any way to deal with the ping differences it feels too much like a pipe dream. Someone should make a documentary on the lost history of the early Russian days and the old facepunch leagues and inform people about the debt they owe to the early members of the hockey? community. Also what is facepunch anyway?,hockeyquestionmark,cza85mp,1,t5_2u9pc
6344053,0,t1_cza7y67,It definitely seems like an unfortunate situation. I like Alex and saw analogues in what he was saying compared to my own experiences so when he first tweeted which at the time I didnt realise was in response to him seeing that video either I ended up getting involved of something of a terse dialogue that then whipped up around him.I cant speak with proper experience of everything thats happened but if I was to take my prior experience of who Alex is and what I think of him and compare it to what Ive heard from you guys here it feels like a few key misunderstandings or things taken the wrong way turned into real spite and from there it snowballed out of proportion. Text is so horrible for this kind of thing. So many situations are created where perhaps there was little true ill will on either side to start with but through the toneless emotionless void of text each side puts their own tone on what the other person says that correlates to their own perspectives and expectations as humans are wont to do.I hesitate to say it because I imagine particularly for people who truly feel burned by the developer here it will seem inflammatory  but I cant help but wonder if maybe its the lack of a full picture surrounding these key events of interaction between dev and community that has built the spite that this situation is founded on.I say that knowing full well that people here with more experience and real knowledge than me might turn around and say bullshit  he really does just hate us or no he does it to piss us off on purpose and that is a risk I take by suggesting this because again I just dont have the full picture only one I can construct in my head after reading through all your replies. But I do hope that its a series of misunderstandings that lead to this situation because if so it means there is definitely a future where you and CS can cooperate.With that in mind Ill pose a perhaps outlandish seeming theory and see how its received from those whove been here and seen things first hand  is it possible that this animosity has built up less due to true fault from either side but more because of terrible misunderstandings or a lack of a full picture? Only just in this thread did we talk about this issue for hours before anyone informed us that the original tweet  one which was decried as antagonizing our community out of spite for no reason by some  was more of a defensive reaction against a video tweeted to the dev that basically attacks him and for those saying well everything in the video is true  even if it were the manner in which it is framed is clearly an attack on his character and I would challenge you to imagine youre watching it from his perspective without feeling at the very least annoyedIs it possible that other key interactions that built this noncommunicative relationship were similar misunderstandings or lacked the full picture in a similar fashion? I just dont believe that Alex is to paraphrase some posters here a bald asshole who spites you guys for his own sadistic machinations. I understand for those who feel particularly slighted by him and his lack of support for you that the difference doesnt seem important  who cares why he doesnt like us the point is he doesnt right? I just mean to say that I dont think your situation with him is entirely hopeless if one can imagine its founded on misunderstandings. If theres no original hatred on either side of this topic it can be moved past when both sides are capable of interacting with each other without aggression without resentment and with a willingness to tolerate and understand the miscommunications and mistakes so inherent in textual conversations that inevitably become flavoured by our own perspectives and perceptions.That as they say is me saying my piece. I definitely do feel like no matter what I say its still has a good chance of being misunderstood or taken as a simple defense of Alex  which again I would blame the downsides of text conversation for. I wouldnt pretend that coming here and simply standing in Alexs corner is going to accomplish anything at all. Ive just wanted to provide a mostly impartial perspective taken from a few steps back in the hopes that it could either help your guys relationship with the dev and thus support for the game in the future or that at the very least it could provoke thought in that direction. But as Ive said before I do feel its very easy to take what Ive written here as a simple defense or worse as judgmental of the people here and their understandable words and actions.But I think with that theres not a lot more for me to say or many more ways to say it so I wont keep poking at the topic unless anyone has a reply that invites such or asks for further discussion. Again if theres anything I can do to help in the future I wont hesitate to do so and I hold hope there will be opportunities in time as there always are. I hope that what Ive said here over these posts has proved more helpful or thought provoking than inflammatory in the end.Bottom line  I feel like this is the kind of situation that never wouldve happened if we all spoke to each other day to day instead of writing to each other with things like Twitter. If Alex was a guy you visited in real life to check in on the progress of hockey? youd probably all still be disappointed hes not making more of it but I dont think the animosity and resentment present would have developed in nearly the same way. Its that belief that has led me to try and negate that animosity and advocate for understanding as much as I can  but again I fully understand people whove been around the block a hundred times on this issue and are done with trying to be understanding. At the end of the day Im the guy who just rolled up to your neighborhood out of nowhere and started preaching for peace like he knows you and your troubles  and that guy is wellmeaning at best patronizing at worst. I just hope that the perspectives and alternatives Ive presented can help or illuminate in at least some small way.EDIT And I really have to emphasize  I dont want to come across as judgemental or fingerwagging against anyone here. Ive read everyones take and I appreciate all of the experiences and reasons presented and I really appreciate everyone taking the time to educate a stranger like me. Im really grateful for how patient youve all been with me in that respect.,hockeyquestionmark,czaqyi8,5,t5_2u9pc

I am more just surprised how consistently Cleveland played good defense all season.  . and . are both solid numbers.  Playoffs we finished around . which is right between the two.

We struggle as it is to find  competent GMs and thats with a more forgivingeasier to understand system by comparison.. One or two key mistakes during the bid process and there goes the next  months for the team. Overbidding on one player or failing to lock in some high end talent and its basically game over.. Trading becomes that much harder when there are cap considerations to deal with making it far harder to overcome poor bidding decisions.. We need practice with this format to help prevent major mistakes from occurring but still no one has stepped up to lead any mini tournaments or even mock drafts.,hockeyquestionmark,daldwtk,7,t5_2u9pc

I understand that without Cryptic this game will barely have a future game wise but this would be taken much more lightly and maybe even more positive if he would at least address the community and give updates about the new versions but from what i gather from different discussions about the games future and Cryptic in general in the past he hasnt really said a word about it and when the community asks him when are the updates coming albeit slightly more harsh than that he doesnt really reply adequately if im wrong please expose me thanks. But i do agree maybe if we do become more positive towards him maybe this will give him the want to continue updating the game instead of being assholes to each other and not have any updates whatsoever.,hockeyquestionmark,dcd2ydk,6,t5_2u9pc
