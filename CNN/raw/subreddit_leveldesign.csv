I was specifically trying to assess it beyond typical shooters or combat situations where as I mentioned there are additional layers related to tactics and player reasoning. I wouldnt even say that my question is Why is high ground so valued because its so contextspecific.Basically I think there must be a more fundamental answer independent of game genres and scenarios. I suppose the most strippeddown testlike scenario would be  two staircases one leading up and one down both are the same distance away from the player either may be to the left or right of the other the player does not know what lies in either direction the player cannot see what lies in either directionGiven that are players statistically more likely to go either up or down first?You say YesDown and Im inclined to agree but that is based on personal suspicious more than experience or evidence.,leveldesign,clmzw6c,3,t5_2t16r
