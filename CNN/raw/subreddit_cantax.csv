Im not an expert on this and you should definitely seek professional help.Your company will owe all outstanding payroll taxes CPP EI including the employee portion as well as interest and penalties on top of that.If you being the company paid HST and then claimed it as an input tax credit then I wouldnt think being refunded HST would do much for you since you would lose those input tax credits.The first thing you might want to consider is if the CRA is correct in their assessment that those people you have been paying as contractors are indeed employees. The law here is grey and established through case law. This CRA Guide lists the factors to consider. Note that CRA guides are CRA interpretation and not law. If you think the CRA is wrong in their assessment and that they actually were contractors you should try to fight them on this point. Could you provide some more information on their employment situation?  Did you control whenhow they worked? Did they provide their own tools and equipment? Theres another list here that asks some of the questions you should consider.Get a designated accountant involved and potentially a tax lawyer. ,cantax,cx7d1pg,2,t5_357tq

And if I cant do that then I need to do better at life. Again these arent going to give you all the ins and outs cause these are complicated tax concepts as Overfitting has touched on but at the very least I hope it gives a basic picture of what is generally going on. ,cantax,cy147i9,2,t5_357tq

9671752,0,t3_574ooq,Yes they were correct in telling you to stop making RRSP contributions. There is no taxable benefit for you to do so. If you want to save for retirement while out of the country open a TFSA and put the money into a mutual fund or something instead. Your unused RRSP room carries forward indefinitely so you can use it in years where you make enough money that the credit you receive is actually to your benefit.I dont know your financial situation but if you are in the lower tax brackets to begin with you really shouldnt be making RRSP contributions in the first place. The only benefit to an RRSP is the deferred tax component which assumes your income will be lower upon retirement. If you are already low income or you land a job with a sweet pension later on and your retirement income is higher than it is currently you are actually loosing out from a tax perspective!Again the best thing to do in those situations is throw the money into a TFSA instead since the tax benefit is immediate.,cantax,da58vh8,1,t5_357tq
9936960,0,t1_db14zfx,My guess regarding pension would be .  They would have deducted taxes for that.As for the cottage  more details is needed. In a typical situation I would suggest a client to sit down with me first and then I will explain to them the proscons of each and I may also provide instructions to the lawyer to change title.  For example tenants in common is very different vs. joint tenancy. I have seen a lot of accountants screw up on this area too as they dont understand the legal aspect of it.  Theres a good chance your grandmother could be taxed at deemed disposition meaning considering it was deposed of and theres capital gains tax or there could be instances where you can use PRE Principle Resident Exemption to shelter a gain from tax during her lifetime or death touch wood. I dont want to give you false hope or info without an understaning of your and your grandmothers situation.  ,cantax,db2t7qy,1,t5_357tq

10637771,0,t3_5qedax,From your various posts you have a very poor grasp of taxes. Youll do a disservice by filing them yourself in this situation. Trying to cheap out on things like this is like trying to do your own fillings. It makes no sense. You generally pay for what you get. Not always but generally. You surely could get a lower fee quote from H and R block or the guy in the strip mall. At the same time you could get a higher quote from a big  downtown. ,cantax,ddd7dhz,1,t5_357tq
