87172,1,t3_1v1ohr,No  you wouldnt tip a postman courier or parcel delivery guy or virtually any other professional.Tipping seems kind but it only gives their boss a reason to cut their pay. Eventually theyd end up working for nothing but tips with the new guys waiting around for the deliveries the experienced guys dont want.Its much better to get a steady wage than the instability of tips.This is speaking as an exdispatch rider delivery firms would treat us as selfemployed and pay by the delivery. They were happy to add new people to their list but they may not have any work for them so we could sit around all day hoping that a job would come in before any of the guys higher up the rankings would return.,england,ceocqkq,1,t5_2qh8h

Im beginning to think its subjective.It isnt in anyway shape or form subjective. Jesus Christ you really are just flat out refusing to understand the meaning of a false equivalency or a logical fallacy.

4089489,0,t3_37bx7w,You might want to look at voluntary work or a gap year position. As an EU national my sister did that for a few months. The work involved caring for people with various disabilities. Not the type of thing you need any licenses for. Shed do things like going for walks with them painting drawing and similar little craft projects etc. Keeping them occupied really. They expected her to work a few hours every day and in return she had a free place to stay with a couple of roommates some australian girls there were Polish guys in another bungalow that did the same thing. Theyd get some basic groceries and a main meal every day and a bit of pocket money.Theres similar things not always disabled people think farm work you can find on various websites. You wont make money as such but you wont lose any either and its a great experience in a mostly stressfree environment.  ,england,crmfd4w,1,t5_2qh8h

5553710,0,t3_3r763f,A new way of looking at businesses we use and try to save on. Everyone I know has hired a van for one reason to the next whether it be to move house pick up a piece of furniture or even in there day jobs seen as cheaper alternative than actually purchasing nowadays. Best thing is to shop around and try to haggle a lower price. But a new website launching in January  is going to be doing just this for this industry. Hirelower.co.uk is turning the tables and pitting commercial van hire companies to bid each other down. Is this the way forward? with auction sites like eBay all the rage now days and the general population having to work longer and longer hours is the way forward to set in motion a bidding war whilst were away from our screens only for us the customers to reap the rewards upon there return??

9174273,0,t3_55yi9u,Have you visited at all? You should definitely spend time here especially in the places youre thinking of moving to as a tourist before you even think about moving.Be careful not to romanticise it. Life in the UK is as mundane boring lonely smelly dirty difficult and disappointing as life in NYC or Georgia. You may feel like a British soul but in reality you will experience culture shock because you are used to American culture systems and society.People immigrate all the time it can be done successfully. But you sound as though you are expecting to come here and for everything to suddenly make sense and for you to suddenly find happiness and contentment.
