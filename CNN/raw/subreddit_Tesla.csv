Well maybe a couple bags of Doritos.   Ours is specifically a salon so its just hanging out with bunches of conversations.  No organized presentations.  More like a monthly dinner party.  But only chips and pop.FE devices or Teslacoil building that might not attract many people.  But weird science meeting involves everything so you can also have althealth stuff high voltage freaks UFO believers sasquatchhunting trips staying overnight in haunted houses road trips etc.   Or just ordering a pizza and looking for Youtube inventor videos.Our group started out as hobbyist meetings at an electronics junk store then for years was just in someones livingroom.What really kept ours going was to have monthly meetings on a totally rigid schedule.   Always a meeting every time and always at the same place for years.Also if they start at PM and go until after midnight then the people still at home can get bored at PM remember its meeting night and come down and catch a few hours of hanging out with the group.   Friday night meetings so they can go late then sleep in on Sat morning.,Tesla,czt6h46,2,t5_2qige
