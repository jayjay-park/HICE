11327036,0,t3_61n9ef,Fairly important detail United Airlines spokesman Jonathan Guerin confirmed the two teens were not allowed on the flight. But he said they girls were traveling using a United employee pass and were not in compliance with our dress code policy for company benefit travel.An internal policy for employees using the airline travel benefit he said specifically forbids leggings while traveling. It is unclear why United considers leggings to be inappropriate and whether other articles of clothing are barred under the policy.Our regular passengers are not going to be denied boarding because they are wearing leggings or yoga pants Guerin said. But when flying as a pass traveler we require this pass travelers to follow rules and that is one of those rules.,unitedairlines,dffwfpf,12,t5_2vmjq

11543271,0,t1_dg4d4hl,gt the airline has the right to remove a customers for overbooking after all other options have been exhaustedThere were still other options. They couldve put their employees on a different flight they couldve drove their employees to the destination they couldve offered a greater cash incentive so that a different customer would give up their seat and they couldve chosen a different passenger. Of course these other options disregard the main option of planning ahead before the plane boarded.,unitedairlines,dg4fjhb,1,t5_2vmjq

11565976,0,t3_64w379,This was my actual United lanyard. When I quit from United the first thing I did was destroy my lanyard. It felt like cutting a leash that was choking me every day.United is the worst airline ever  filled with incompetence and lacks common and business sense. I watch the video and it summarizes the entire airline in a  second video. Employees have amazingly little amount of power to do anything good. If they do something out of the ordinary they only get punished by their superiors. Harassment and intimidation by management is common. Munoz easily inherited a disaster from Jeff Smisek ousted in the NJ port authority scandal with tons of current middle management that is corrupt.Long story short United sucks  it is built in their company culture.,unitedairlines,dg70bkx,5,t5_2vmjq
