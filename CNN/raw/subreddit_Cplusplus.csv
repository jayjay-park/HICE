530185,0,t1_cg01wrl,I needed to get arbitrarily slow compile times without requiring lots of source code. I can now create a source file that is less than  characters    include fib.h    static int svalue  FibSlowtlt FibNMediumgtvalueand have it take arbitrarily long just by adjusting the value of FibNMedium. This lets me create a very small project which simulates the compiletime problems that are usually only encountered in much larger projects.Templates are complicated and template metaprogramming may not be the best place to start when learning them.,Cplusplus,cg0jf03,1,t5_2qh6x

3219590,0,t1_covo36b,Lets say you have a culinary library. A base class in this library is Silverware. Your library also has a Fork Spoon and Knife class each of which inherits Silverware. Fork has a virtual function Forkstab. Spoon has a virtual function Spoonscoop. Knife has a virtual function Knifecut. And you want your library to be extensible so that users can define their own types of Silverware allowing them to customize the way their Forks stab the way their Spoon scoop and the way their Knives cut.Now your library is able to take a list of Silverware and investigate how the items in that list can be applied to a list of Foods. For each Silverware item youll want to dynamically cast to Fork Spoon and Knife and see whether that Silverware object is able to stab scoop or cut. Because if the end user decided to create a Spork object and put it in the Silverware list youd better be able to handle that case.,Cplusplus,covpo83,1,t5_2qh6x

4882130,0,t3_3hqx2n,The most reasonable thing I can suggest is to do some automatic code generation. Prior to compiling have a program that reads the string interprets the contents of the string and injects the necessary C code into an automatically generated header or source file.

Basically youll be able to write something like    templateltclass Tgt    ContainerltTgtamp Containeroperatorconst ContainerltTgtamp rhs expects rhs.size  thisgtsizeThe compiler will take care of the rest for you.But ... last I heard its going to be a while C or C timeframe before such a feature gets in the standard.Theres another option you didnt bring up maybe because it doesnt apply to your situation.  Is it possible to let the compiler do the check for you?  Can you make the size of the Container static maybe as a template parameter?

8127829,0,t3_4qikxb,Encapsulation deals with the variables and methods and being able to hide them from other classes.For example     Private int foo    Public int foobarIf those two belong to the same class Class A only Class A will be able to access and know about foo and foobar. If you have class B and create an Object of Class A in B then A will only be able to see foobar. That is encapsulation quickly summed up.Abstraction allows you to create abstract classes for example lets make an abstract class called Shape.Lets have our Abstract Class Shape contain abstract methods for calculating GetArea and GetPerimeter. Why have them abstract? Because calculating the area for a circle is different than for a rectangle. But we can also include regular non abstract methods for GetName or GetColor since those will be the same logic across all kinds of shapes. So when we create Concrete class circle and rectangle that inherent from abstract class shape they will be expected to have method definitions for area and perimeter that are unique to them and will also know about the methods GetName and GetColor.,Cplusplus,d4tn3rb,4,t5_2qh6x

10004794,0,t3_5iu53p,This is a hard question to ask thank you for asking it. Have an upvote just for asking.Code is written once Code is modified occasionally and code is read often. Code is also most often read by a compiler and it doesnt know anything about your goals that isnt in your source code. From these simple truths can can infer that if we wont to save the most effort then code should be optimized to be read instead of ease of its initial creation.You can do anything with goto and if. You can simulate any control flow construct. You can make shitty functions shitty loops while and for you can make objects and classes simulate execeptions.... Some of this can even be done easily. But then try reading that code. None of those goto statements convey why human semantic meaning. This is more difficult for a human or a compiler to read. If you tried to write a loop with a goto and an if and it skipped some item or went to the wrong label the compiler does not have enough information to tell you what you did was wrong and it is harder for a human to find because there is more text and less structure for them to work with.If I use an exception you know I have an error I am alerting us to. If I have a range based for loop you know I want to do something to each entry in a container. If I used a class I am telling you these things form some higher concept together. If I used something from the std algorithms header I am clearly conveying that I am attempting some well known computation. In addition to human clarity all of these allow extra performance optimization opportunities to the compiler as well.This seems like part of a general trend in programming to have more constructs that each convey more implied information. It seems to be a good thing I can see no downside in the long term. In the short term I occasionally need to think more about my code for a bit more before I write something fresh.,Cplusplus,dbbnjbf,1,t5_2qh6x
