6137918,0,t3_3zkdz3,Im not an atheist but they would likely try to understand chakras subtle bodies etc. from the purely scientific point of view. If you can fully do that idk. But they probably try to understand the connection with the lymphatic system glands that whole route while denying or overlooking the actual existence of etheric energies understanding it as purely bioenergy,Chakras,cynbexy,2,t5_2w6jb
8035487,0,t1_d4iyj24,Speaking of Mantak Chia I do recommend working on the Lower Dan Tien which corresponds roughly to the area between the sacral and solar plexus chakras different energy system than the chakras but I have had success stimulating both those areas through these practices. Specifically look in to any qigong system that will involve moving energy along the front channel and working with the Lower Dan Tien. Also look in to reverse breathing this will likely work and sinking chi in to the LDT which involves placing your mind and breath in to that area while sitting silently. After a few weeks of the above practices I was able to stimulate that area energetically. But even with all these things happening I dont think it has anything to do with sexual energy or libido. ,Chakras,d4j9iq0,1,t5_2w6jb
