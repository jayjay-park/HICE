8560009,0,t1_d6adn8i,Thank you for replying. Ive checked the known English websites on ismailism and read the articles that seem appropriate for the stage my quest for knowledge is in. For now Im looking for preferably books on the legitimacy of the imamate and on the dogmas. ,ismailis,d6bktlo,1,t5_2tk3x
9238137,0,t1_d8mu729,I really cant tell if you are helping me or not. I understand what you are saying but your characterization does not seem to be the general rule in the world. To narrow down my question a bit Im asking if the Ismaili faith is a closed community that one is born into or if one can approach the tradition from the outside. The reason I asked in the first place is because I want to learn from people who are already part of the tradition and the faith. And to an outsider such as myself reading is my only point of access. But what assurances do I have that I am actually correctly interpreting or practicing the faith in a way that is true to its tradition?,ismailis,d8n02ht,2,t5_2tk3x
9244068,0,t3_56yifc,I recommend reading this article. It speaks to the Nizari understanding of the sacrifice of Imam Hussein. Feel free to post any follow up questions.,ismailis,d8nr43x,2,t5_2tk3x
11139780,0,t1_det8vgr,But but but as soon as you muslimpilosiper enter the discussionany discussion! where people are critical of Karim Aga you have your back up and begin DEFENCE.  Are Ismailis to drop any critical thinking skills they have when discussing actions and motivations of our Ismaili Holy family?  Are you telling me we cant critique ANYTHING our monarchy does?  Are you saying everything he does if you have true faith is perfectly fine?  Cause thats what I think youre saying except you use more words. Are there alternative facts we need to abide by in order to discuss some of aga karims poor decisionsor lack of a stance?  Surely he must have made some mistakes in life no?  I would hope so or his journeys gonna suck.    Some people question nothing he does some question everything he does most are in between.  in terms of responsible leadership i think hes failing our queer community.  But you disagree and now blame his momins most of who will do anything he says to or not to.  If he says we need more gay mukhis tomorrow you will be first inline to promote gays as mukhis no?  So really youre involved in this part of this discussion to serve your own ego or do you think hes watching us...right now?    ,ismailis,deuolc9,3,t5_2tk3x
