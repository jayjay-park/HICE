7494917,0,t3_4hxi78,Skaarf isnt op if you have ever played him yourself. Yes he has insane damage and can easily v anyone even at level  if not cautious with his passive And from there he only gets stronger. Goop his ult which can basically one shot carries if you get it off for the full duration. But what Skaarf really lacks is mobility. He is the most unmobile carry in the game probably. Think of Skaarf as a Saw. How do you beat Saw? All in him with hard cc or quick burst when he doesnt have stacks up. How do you beat Skaarf? Guess what. Same way. Hes squishy and immobile so if hes doing damage to you and you arent focusing him as a team your doing it wrong.,VentGlory,d2u4ry4,1,t5_3bfqx

8151169,0,t3_4qsvrm,I did not find any need for it because the fountain or renewal kept me alive very well already and  because I focused more on offensive they died before they could touch me because they had no armor.,VentGlory,d4wfzkc,1,t5_3bfqx

9782474,0,t3_5f7es9,Instalock man. The problem is you are trying to be considerate.If youre in ranked draft consider insisting on the role you want to play.You could also try off meta roam. Glaive can work even in high tier. Gwent is fun too.  Get fountain storm crown  chargers and steal the enemy jungle. ,VentGlory,daiwjj2,2,t5_3bfqx

10090601,0,t3_5k642n,Yeah the usual method is to try to ping that youre going to base while pinging the warning. More people do get it than used to but theres still those who think pinging is a system of berating someone else for doing something they think is stupid and no matter what you ping they will think youre just trying to tell them they suck. ,VentGlory,dbmtllv,1,t5_3bfqx
