1755467,0,t3_2ekid9,I found the answer at    This was a convention used in the Census  ZCTAs but was not used for the  ZCTAs. The threedigit ZCTA code and an XX suffix are applied to a large land area generally larger than  square miles where we had insufficient information to determine the fivedigit codes. The USPS may not provide fivedigit ZIP Code delivery service in this area. These are generally rural areas with little settlement for example parks forest lands and desert and mountainous areas. Smaller areas were generally absorbed into adjacent fivedigit ZCTAs but for larger areas we did not want to overextend the surrounding fivedigit ZCTAs.For Census  the requirements for ZCTA delineation state that all census blocks receive a ZCTA code. Because large water features may border many fivedigit ZCTAs it would be difficult to divide up the water features and assign the parts to the fivedigit ZCTAs on the land. Furthermore any attempt to add these water features to landbased ZCTAs would greatly distort the size and shape of the land ZCTAs particularly in coastal areas. To avoid these problems such water features receive ZCTA codes ending in HH special code for hydrographic features.For the  Census there were no XX or HH ZCTAs assigned. Only fivedigit ZCTAs were produced and large unpopulated areas were excluded from the delineations. For the  Census there is no walltowall national coverage for ZCTAs.,USPS,ck0fnbv,1,t5_2r25j

8146700,0,t3_4qsw2r,Ill be honest with you as a letter carrier on an all mounted route.. Management is really pushing for time money and safety reasons that we do not exit or reverse the vehicle except when we absolutely have too. Like to deliver a parcel or a certified letter.. or if we have to go down a dead end street to turn around.. etc.. If anything is blocking clear access to the mailbox then we are not to deliver it per their instructions. Im sure you should have got some previous PS forms stating to keep the access clear by  feet each way. Can I be honest with you.. The simple solution is to just move the car or find another spot to park it. You wont win this battle.  These routes are timed and in a lot of cases theyre overburdened. That letter carrier isnt allowed to back up and they cant get out to deliver your mail.. They probably lack the time to do it. I usually have an average of about  boxes blocked on my route each day. The time it takes park correctly in safe area without blocking traffic and getting out to deliver the mail starts to add up when you have to do it  times a day.  The routes are specifically timed by driving to each box and time is added for each parcel.. pretty much everything is accounted for. While we may not agree with these numbers its what management goes by.. If the carrier does start to get out.. then the carrier can start to get into to trouble for unauthorized overtime. So when management asks why they are in unauthorized overtime  giving them the excuse that they had to get out for blocked boxes doesnt fly very well when theyve already been instructed not to do so by management. Not to mention that when you start to get out for one person.. other neighbors notice that and then they start blocking their boxes. People then start to think that the carrier should have to get out even though they shouldnt because they see them doing it.. Remember the post office set up the mounted routes to save time and money compared to walking routes.  Then you end up having a neighbor calling the post office complaining that the carrier got out for one person and not them. Now the supervisor is wasting time trying to explain to the customer that carrier isnt suppose to be getting out.. etc..etc..Dont be mad at the carrier either they are just trying to do the job the best way they can within the rules set by management. Like most people at their own job they have to do what their bosses tell them. Management also does street observation in their personal vehicles and if they were to observe a carrier getting out to deliver the mail or backing up to get a box.. They could be written up by management or possibly put off the clock since they have already been instructed not to do so  or because they violated safety regulations. Anyways like I said before.. You wont win this battle. You should just move your car. If you want access to curbside service you need to provide clear access to said curb. Otherwise they will withdraw mail delivery and require you to get a PO Box if you want future delivery. If they already gave you notice to withdraw service  Im sure the local Postmaster or OIC officer in charge is aware of the situation.,USPS,d4vvua9,13,t5_2r25j

9143606,0,t3_55geqx,So rural carrier here. But pretty sure city carriers arent supposed to case DPS at all.I say it depends on your route. I typically dont case most of my DPS for my normal route. The last third I do because the majority of it is just strings of boxes like this and it takes a lot of the thoughttime out of it on the street. I typically only case ALL of my DPS in two situations Boxholdersadvos or Im waiting for parcels to be sorted and its gonna be a while. Interestingly this also leads me to a situation where Im casing my DPS from the end of my route to the beginning. A caveat to this is also that my particular route has such horrendous road conditions that casing all of it can occasionally lead to disaster when I hit certain bumps in the road and shit goes flying. Ive had it happen a couple times especially with bumps I cant see. Always fun to go to the back of the truck and see things strewn about for later in my route because of this.Why to take your DPS to the street though? You take up more overall time because you increase your office time. Youre touching your DPS three times in order to case everything  once to case it once to pull it down and once to deliver it. On the other hand youre only touching your DPS once if you take it to the street fingering  delivery.If youre driving a POV route you should probably case all of your DPS however due to the constraints of actual room in your vehicle will impose.That said when Im running a new route I case all nonCBU DPS. I find it a waste of time to case DPS for CBUs as long as I can easily tell where CBUs are in the case  not all regulars seem to understand we RCAs dont always get their quirks when theyre setting up the case. When I have CBUs I just bundle it and deal with it when I get there because all the addresses are usually clearly marked in the CBUs and I can sort through whatever doesnt belong.For my splits I also case my DPS there because I usually dont really know the route meaning vacancies holds misthrows NSNs etc. well enough to take it to the street.TLDR If the situation demands it Ill case my DPS if not then not.,USPS,d8b0n2p,2,t5_2r25j

It can be tempting to just chuck parcels into your van so you can get the hell away from the office but taking the time to organize at least the first half of them will save you from wasted trips. Carry the parcels for a swing that will minimize extra stops. And dont walk faster than you can have the mail ready. A slower pace that ensures you have the mail ready by the time you reach the box will be easier on you than speed walking only to be standing at a box fingering mail. Not to mention the fact that it is much easier to move at a consistent pace rather than a stop go stop go pace.And case neatly! Small to large.

11213232,0,t3_6015am,So everyone does things differently and in their own way even down to loading the truck. Some of it is going to depend on how your office functions example we do not have these mythical yellow trays where I am at some is just going to depend on what you find easiest I dont casepull down my sprs with my flats for example.Some tips from me If you can avoid it dont case your dps. Else figure out what parts of your route make it easier on the street to deliver without hogging your office time. Example on my primary route I only case the last third. On my secondary route because its a pov route I case everything. My previous secondary route was almost entirely nbu so I only cased the curbsidebusiness deliveries most of which was on very busy streets. This made it easier for me but the sub who has it as her primary does not do it quite the same way. Plus Im slower than molasses at casing dps.ampnbsp Learn your line of travel. Take your car and drive it when you have a day off watch for boxes take notes if you need to on certain boxes that are in weird places.ampnbsp I dont mark my parcels in the case unless its a route Im very new to we dont typically get proper training on routes here and marking in the case takes a while so even when running cold I dont always mark parcels even on pov routes. Occasionally Ill mark a large parcel since Ill generally have it in the back of the truck and dont want to have to backtrack if I can help it.ampnbsp Learn what parts of your route are heavy on parcels and sprs. If you have large cbu stops that get a ton of sprs throw them all in a tub together and sort them out when you get to that stop. If theres a particular neighborhood or street that functions similarly separate them in a tub while youre casing and deal with them separate from other sprs or on the street. As an example to this on my secondary route there is on neighborhood that I deliver to where the sprsparcels are on the heavy side relative to other parts of the route and its only two streets. So I put everything for those two streets in a tub separate from everything else and deal with it out there. This will also help you remember what order the numbers for the boxes go in odds then evens ascending then descending boxes increment by etc. the next time youre in that neighborhood.ampnbsp The way that I DO mark my parcels is sort of battleshipesque I write on them with a sharpie what part of the case theyre at this also helps you remember what part of the route youre on! so any parcels in the first section of the first row are A next section is A etc. I stopped doing this with my sprs a while back but sometimes I mark one or two if Im low on parcels that day so I can kind of estimate how long Im going to take from that point forward.ampnbsp When you are loading your truck it sounds like you get high volume of actual mail. Load your trays first mark them in some order that makes sense for you and load your parcels AFTER that. If youre running a very rural route bad roads etc. this will also keep your mail from flying all over the place when you have parcels on top of your trays.ampnbsp When I have routes where I am taking dps to the street I pull out a little bit at a time and sit it in my lap and go through that only when I am stopped at a box. I keep a tray of flatsraw mail I have cased a tray of dps and a tray of sprs on my shelf and keep an eye on all three so I dont miss anything and my parcels are usually between the seat and the shelf. As I go through parcels I pull them forward so that I dont leave any behind. As you learn your route youll be better able to recognize what order they go in and when the best places to stop and pull more parcels up are.ampnbsp Most of this job is muscle memory. Youre not going to get it on the first day the first week and probably not even the first month. Thats okay.
