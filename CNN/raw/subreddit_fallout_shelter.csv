4727977,0,t1_ctqfdwq,I feel your pain. I bit the bullet and started a new vault and bought the  lunchbox kit. Its B.S. But I figure I like the game and I spend  on games Ive never played in hopes that Ill like it.  The kit helps immensely. Itll give you the weapons you need to protect your door a good amount of outfits and caps. Im still going with this vault. Im near max dwellers raiders and roaches are laughable and I rotate  max SPECIAL dwellers to rake in the goodies. The  is well worth it if you enjoyed the game at all. ,fallout_shelter,ctqi2y1,1,t5_38oos

4875975,0,t3_3hoc5e,For reference my NukaCola Bottler is  rooms wide but at the first level not upgraded yet. It produces  foodwater though every time I try to compare each resource is only given . Lately Ive been trying to figure this out on my own.    As for frequency it finishes every  minutes. It will likely depend on the dwellers you have and their stats. As well as how many caps you have to fully upgrade the NukaCola Bottler Im not sure what the higher level rooms have to yield. ,fallout_shelter,cu95li5,1,t5_38oos

Also you have to open the vault and confirm the birth for the child timer to start. Letting it stay closed  hours after conception means youll come back to a birth not a new adult.,fallout_shelter,cyg9ps8,3,t5_38oos
6802809,0,t3_48wdwe,Ryuu is correct. You wont be able to destroy your living quarters if doing so drops you below your dweller pop including dead bodies.You can try the following. Destroy all rocks if you havent already.. If you are at  dwellers evict some enough that you could destroy one of your living quarters.. Send some dwellers to the wastes if needed just to get them out of rooms so you are not having to juggle them between rooms.. Destroy rooms as needed to run the elevators for your new layout all the way to the bottom.. Build your new living quarters at the bottom of the vault.. Destroy your old living quarters higher up as long as doing so wont cut off any other rooms from the rest of your vault.. Repeat steps  and  with your storage rooms.. Repeat steps  and  with your training rooms putting them however far down the vault you want.. You should now have the room at the top to start rearranging your production rooms.. Recall any dwellers you sent exploring to get them out of the way once you have moved enough rooms to their new locations.,fallout_shelter,d0ne3xc,1,t5_38oos
