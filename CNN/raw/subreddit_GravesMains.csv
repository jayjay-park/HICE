9315897,0,t1_d8vtaxv,have you played with as quints and blues? It feels really good and makes your early clears way faster and allows you to put out more pressure or clear faster. Its especially good if youre going the  shot build and dont get phantom dancer. Plus the whole point of runes are to help you with your early game anyways.,GravesMains,d8wux48,1,t5_389g1

10728543,0,t3_5thkz5,Im not  sure on how you play but I can give you personal advice.Just make sure you are not getting over cocky to the point that you get caught out. This was my number  problem on graves for a long time. Throwing. You know you have the damage but dont let it get the best of you.Make sure no matter how far ahead you get play smart know your limits. Play aggressive  graves is good at it  just dont allow yourself to make dumb mistakes because of it D,GravesMains,ddmkhx7,1,t5_389g1
10819132,0,t3_5um458,Can you link posts about people complaining about graves?Ive been looking and i cant find one. Just want to see why they would believe graves need a nerf and not lethality.,GravesMains,ddvx11w,1,t5_389g1

11272370,0,t3_60psje,Itll be marginally better for basically all users of it maybe not as much for graves but its definitely better.,GravesMains,df9pg8m,1,t5_389g1
11279560,0,t3_60ybrd,and Im gonna still keep banning her every game until they remove part of her kit. Why does the Q need to do true damage? Why does her W need to do max HP damage and why does her E need to do stun everyone in AOE outside the target? Why does her ult need to give her bonus magic damage on attacks? That is the true issue with her kit and why it cant be balanced. Its simply loaded with a lot of AND ALSO IT DOES... type of stuff. her ult is a strictly better version of J ult already with untargetablty and not being able to flash out.,GravesMains,dfaisgz,10,t5_389g1

11449471,0,t1_dfts7xa,Hes going to be considered trash now for  patches with a  w.r then end up God tier again like every time they nerf him xd,GravesMains,dftsdnc,10,t5_389g1
11500670,0,t3_645i4p,Additional attack speed is NOT always welcome. How can you play Graves for more than a few games thinking that without understanding how he works fundamentallyPost here for months helping others and get  upvotes. Make one short comment and punished as such. You want one attack speed item on Graves. Never two. Read his passive again. ,GravesMains,dfzln3b,-3,t5_389g1
11504144,0,t3_647cx1,Most likely. Will have to wait after next patch to be certain but he will probably get nerfed again. Kinda what happens when you overload a champions kit. Makes them very hard to balance.,GravesMains,dfzzu1c,3,t5_389g1
11549061,0,t3_64tjan,I think this was really well done. Your positioning looked crazy good.,GravesMains,dg537lz,6,t5_389g1
11567877,0,t1_dg17gs8,Lol I feel you bro. Used to play Udry a lot before I discovered Graves after his rework. Probably gonna play him a lot again soon,GravesMains,dg7833w,2,t5_389g1
11586816,0,t3_658zg8,what the actual fuck was that lol. Seems like a bug or smth P but it could be a new combo too,GravesMains,dg9dfnc,1,t5_389g1
