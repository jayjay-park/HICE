7597945,0,t3_4j0yec,Healer is redundant with a selfhealing team. Tyrande is fine with Stitches Dehaka Diablo Thrall Raynor Zagara etc. Look at healing capacity at a team level not an individual level.Remember all the matches you never used your big healing ult because nobody ever needed it? Yeah thats the kind of match in which you dont need a healer.,toptierhots,d35ujo1,1,t5_3edme

7621386,0,t1_d38dtsd,I assume its because tempest and DsA have only played one or two series so its very hard to know their level yet. We will know more at the end of the week. I think tempest could be tier  and mYi should be tier  but thats just my opinion.,toptierhots,d38ifmt,1,t5_3edme
