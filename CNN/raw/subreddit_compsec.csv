If not that would still be my thought it kept the decrypt stuff handy so as to not interrupt the update process but doing that on the initial reboot is unacceptable IMO since it did a full boot and would have had to store the key.  Also yeah probably not the right sub but an interesting find.,compsec,cy3v18g,1,t5_2rsaz

What youre referencing is phish.You can look at something like automated like proofpoint or ironport but those are limited by what is known.  You need to go with defense indepth and Dont overlook user education as well.  Good luck.  Phishing plays on the biggest vulnerability in your network your users.,compsec,d1y9bkz,1,t5_2rsaz
