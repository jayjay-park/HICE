11299280,0,t1_dfcispe,I was using the Weight Watchers app the past  weeks and have lost  lbs.  Screenshot of what the diary looks like Really love how it simplifies the whole caloriemacro counting process into a daily point value. Then in addition to you daily point value theres weekly points you may use on any day. Weekly points allow flexibility to go over your daily point value for some cheat mealsdrinks.I have sucked at tracking points on the weekends and wanted to make a change with my tracking app.  Im not a hardcore athlete trying to hit macros so the more simple the better for me.Snapshot of Ultimate Food Diary If youre happy with myfitnesspal do you. I just wanted to make a change since the past few years of falling off myfitness pal what I was doing wasnt working for me!,Team_Florescence,dfcr8th,1,t5_3jkfp
11302826,0,t3_6199ou,Hello! First of all I am blown away by how supportive and friendly this community is. Very excited to get started on this adventure with you all!My name is Aleis and this is my first challenge. In college fitness was an integral part of my life. Most of my social time was in fitness classes dance classes and performance dancing. I walked everywhere and found it pretty easy to eat healthily in the meal hall. As soon as I got into the real world all of that changed. Fitness classes are expensive I am sitting at a desk for most of my day and it is so much easier in the moment just just snack on junk food or order delivery than to cook full meals. When my friends and I get together its almost always to eat drink and chill. I have gained about  pounds in the past few years and am hoping to change my habits and drop at least  of those during this challenge. I think having a community like this will be really helpful! So excited to get to know all of you and to develop some healthy habits and healthy bodies! Also my MFP name is aleismurphy feel free to add me as a friend!F |  | ft in | SW  | CW  | GW  | Challenge GW ,Team_Florescence,dfd5py3,3,t5_3jkfp
