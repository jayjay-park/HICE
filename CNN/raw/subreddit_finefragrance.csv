6940313,0,t3_4ar88c,Since I know you have a sample as well or on the way MFK Absolue Pour Le Soir as my bed scent. I dabbed it on because it is quite overwhelming and aweinspiring when sprayed and really calls for a crowd of people. Dabbed on it is a much gentler experience. Im quite enjoying the cumin note in the dry down combined with the honey and floral notes as a lead up to joining the smoke. And the cumin does smell a little like urine but Im okay with it.  Its quite beautiful.,finefragrance,d130ib5,1,t5_3d6oq
7183159,0,t3_4duqaj,I have a sample of vintage Fracas from a kind redditor. Its an explosion of waxy buttery tuberose quite beautiful. But theres no underlying animalic musky civet. ambergris type stuff. So I am thinking it is the Alfin vintage version. When I ordered vintage samples from The Perfumed Court last week I specified Fracas only if it was the preAlfin version.  they didnt have anything preAlfin and sent my second choice Narcisse Noir. Im really curious to smell the difference. To me the fracas I have is almost a soliflore even though it has jasmine too.,finefragrance,d1unutl,1,t5_3d6oq
