979820,0,t3_24yrtn,We could do both. For the most part when these things are finished there are usually two or three standout teams. We will probably do a vote for this sub alone and then a vote in CFB. I see your points and while some fans will look past the offensive lineman when it comes to voting I just dont think it will be THAT big of an issue. We can look back at this at the end of the year and give points based on AA teams but I also want people to build teams that would work together. Instead of drafting  great passrushing LBs you should draft players that would actually formulate a cohesive unit. ,RedCFBFantasyDraft,chfnwy8,1,t5_31o75
