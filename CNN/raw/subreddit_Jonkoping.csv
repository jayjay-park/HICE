7658271,0,t1_d3bk77j,Once you picked Jkpg youll get an email where you can enroll in the courses and select your housing options. When you arrive here you can pickup the contract and the keys at the accomodation service in the uni. I cant really say something about the level in Tilburg but my gut says the education is better there. However I think future employers dont really care what university youve attended in your exchange but rather care about the international experience youve gained except for when its Harvard Princeton etc.Good luck choosing!,Jonkoping,d3cpah0,1,t5_2sudh
