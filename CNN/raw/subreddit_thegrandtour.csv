Hes got a really cringy way of behaving idk if its because he was nervous for his first show or because he generally behaves that way. I also hope the Rally track was a one time use.

I just hate that they tried so hard to make even sound the same with the way the narration it just didnt sound right and it felt forced. While not a perfect analogy I look at it the same way I felt with parks and rec when it first came out. The office was a hit show. They knew the format worked but it parks and rec season one felt far too much like the office. However once they found their way the show took to its own. I hope the same happens here.

For better or worse right now the only way to get the highest bitrate streams from Netflix or Amazon is to have a K television.  Period.    Plus you can get a  K TV for around .

But much of the press for GT involved one or more of them talking about how much they needed to reinvent the show from a format they knew worked Top Gear into a new one.And yet they kept a lot of Top Gear. Theres The NewsConversation Street the StigAmerican the studiotent a track a lap board and the general format of the new show is nearly identical to any episode of the old one. Although they did kill a lot of celebrities. If thats not a running gag and theres a real celebrity segment next week its virtually a carbon copy of TG.Dont get me wrong Im not complaining. After Top Gear ended I was left wanting more Top Gear and this has delivered in spades with some eyepopping visuals to boot. But what happened to all that talk of having to create a new show from the ground up and taking risks and so on? I didnt really see that.

9689789,0,t1_da7fv2m,Just a long shot guess but I think maybe hell change during the season perhaps towards a more Stiglike character or maybe he simply wont be heard in future episodes.  The thing that started getting me wondering where theyre heading with the joke was the communist running gag about the cars.  Could we be seeing him becoming more and more accepting in the future of other cars?  In the past the running gag has been that the Stig has been property kept in sheds and storage lockers etc.  Maybe by keeping him at the track testing cars hell become more and more British until they have to replace him with a new model?  Or maybe hell be driven so nuts by being stuck at a boring track in England?  Or maybe hell befriend the Old Lady?  Or maybe hell befriend the sheep?  Or maybe hell be killed off by one of the many road hazards around the track?  Where else are they going with this gag? No matter what I see The American not as something negative but as a joke that can be played with in future episodes.  Theyre no longer constrained with the Top Gear formula so they can do whatever they want with him.  Think blacksuit Stig from early Top Gear.  We had no idea where they were going with that joke and eventually the Stig was killed off replaced with a new one.  Maybe The American will be killed off and replaced with The German or The Canadian or something along those lines for the next season? ,thegrandtour,da7gzmd,1,t5_3ek53

Keep that stuff... lose the american lose the celebrity braincrash bit at least it seems they are already phasing this out or at least down to one person per week.

There seemed to be glares and shadows across the drivers face on every external shot. I paused a few times and the shadows looked like theyd been added in post. Not that I know anything about digital effects.       I certainly dont blame them for not racing what looked like a pretty dangerous course but it seems silly that they wouldnt acknowledge that theyre bringing in a pro driver. They brought in special guest Stigs plenty of times on the old show. ,thegrandtour,dd201vu,2,t5_3ek53

10550622,0,t1_dd409wi,Problem is that people feel entitled to an opinion with GT because theyve watched it be born.  People didnt bitch as much  about annoying things on TG because it was a tradition  basically.  Without realizing that those traditions were all started at one point in the original show.  Another huge aspect of it is that change  bad.  How many people would have bitched about a silent driver character on GT if there had been a talking one on TG? I think a lot.  ,thegrandtour,dd4155r,11,t5_3ek53

They have over a decade of frendship with one another and thats very hard to beat because their jokes are usually friendly banter between good friends which to me makes the show stand out.
