3617813,0,t3_31spjy,I think its mostly that Doug wants to prove that a stoner can still run a normal show within the set format. I do believe he goes a little overboard with that sometimes. I really enjoyed hearing the story again and remembering the last time Ralphie was on the show.,GettingDoug,cq4nnir,7,t5_2yvx6

7478079,0,t3_4hl8h9,My favourite episode so far. I fuckin love Josh Blue And Ron White totally won me over. When he brought up the Brian Johnson  ACDC topic my stomach dropped. Favourite band as long as I can remember saw them again in September and now this bullshit so he hearing someone who talk about it who actually knows Brian was sick. ,GettingDoug,d2s7qlp,2,t5_2yvx6
