2722062,0,t3_2r8g6j,Im not sure but Im going to guess. Its possible that Botan is only able to change from spirit to human in the Spirit World. Also even if she was in spirit form wouldnt most of the characters still be able to see and effect her? Her spirit form is most likely different that Yusukes spirit form because Yusuke was dead when in that form.By the time Botan appears from the tree Yusuke is already able to see demons and spirits Kuwabara has higher spiritual awareness than Yusuke so its possible she was in her Spirit form the entire time and Kuwabara was just able to see her. I find this unlikely because later in the show characters that are not spiritually aware can see Botan and her ability to change from Spirit to Human is never mentioned again.The third thought I have is that she was in her Human form the entire time when she appeared to Yusuke and Kuwabara. Its possible that she has some ability to make herself invisible to people with a low enough spiritual awareness for a limited time. It doesnt sound too farfetched to me.This also brings the Special Defense Force into mind. Im not sure exactly what you would call their race same as Botan. I wouldnt think they have a human form or need one. They usually fight demons and Id say that demons are aware enough to see them in their normal form.,YuYuHakusho,cndhj76,5,t5_2sanu

3061288,0,t1_coeqaj3,I think this is because of the disparity of stress in Japanese society between middle and high school.In the US where Im from its high schoolers who are super stressed out  not sure if theyre going to get into the college they want or even if they want to go to college  taking standardized tests that people think will determine their entire future  hormones are raging etc. etc. etc.Basically the Japanese have the same thing except its when the kids are in thth grade.  Theyre competing to get into prestigious high schools and such.  Hormones are still raging  its an existence that is extremely upintheair everchanging and stressful.  I think thats why their protagonists tend to be in middle school.  Not saying it translates well to other audiences but I think thats probably a pretty significant reason why it is the way it is,YuYuHakusho,cofasl2,4,t5_2sanu

11659392,0,t3_62y59i,for me i have three all time favorite scenes the funniest the saddest and the best.the funniest  when yusuke was fighting miyuki in tarukanes mansion just cause of kuwabaras reactions alone and yusukes line when he finds out miyuki is a transexual demon the family jewels have not been stolenthe saddest  honestly i would say the finale of the series cause thats when you realize this show is all over and you wish you could have gotten much more but you also see everyone gets a happy ending.and the absolute best scene ever  yusuke vs sensui when yusuke is possessed by raizen...as the music is just fucking perfect and so epic and out of all the anime ive ever seen NO FIGHT IN ANIME has ever been that one sided not even in dragonball where the powers can get pretty insane...cause as soon as yusuke throws the first punch its already over the rest after that is pretty much pure brutality as he literally beats sensui to near death.,YuYuHakusho,dghlus7,1,t5_2sanu
