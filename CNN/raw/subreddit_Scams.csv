1002280,0,t1_chi6nqu,True. I agree. And that the term trial if Im not mistaken comes with a time period for one to give something a go before deciding the next step to anything. However for this company it has committed fraudulent and scam. Its day trial period is not legitimate as it does not keep its guaranteed promises of delivery within  days that is claimed on its ad. Furthermore it would be understandable if the parcel is late maybe a week or two. For for the whole month? Once the trial period is over despite whether you receive the parcel or not automatically the buyer is liable or that somehow heshe has agreed to purchase the product on a monthly basis. I understand that even as a consumer wise decision and thoroughly background researches are our responsibility. Yet even as an enterprise morality and protecting consumers rights is the basis element of any business. And with this thread Im hoping for more awareness for consumers and also we cannot disregard the fact that there have been reported complaints from past and present buyers who had purchase the free trial product and has never seen the shadow of the promised free trial yet had and has their money taken from their bank account. Anyone would think that served these people right for being foolishly fall prey to such scheme but I believe all these consumers would have learnt their lesson. But I believe as well if complaints arewere made it shows how much those savings meant to them and also these exvictims are hoping that no more future victims will get caught up in this scheme anymore. ,Scams,chi7tz5,1,t5_2qrt0

Once he started giving me excuses I stuck around more out of curiosity than anything else  particularly as I realized at that point that this fellow was probably selling stolen goods. Once he changed his story about meeting at his house at the last minute I was convinced that this was the case. Im not meeting this schmuck nor buying his stolen merchandise.Shifty bastard.

3786477,0,t3_33rvq6,This is a pretty easy one.First your friend is making money off of your subscription.  The person who recruited her is making money off her subscription.  This is where the pyramid scheme comes in  they are like other MLMs in that they make their money by having their subscribers recruit for them.Secondly the money back guarantee is not for the monthly plan starting at  its for the monthly  pack which is an additional  per month which you have to subscribe to for a minimum of  months to be eligible for the guarantee.So in that  month time period you will have spent  in monthly membership package an additional  for the monthly  pack PLUS what ever money they told you to purchase in stock to be eligible for the plan.  Lets just assume they told you to invest  per month your total cost would be .  If you did not make at least  in trading they would recompense you if they are honest  your  month subscription fee multiplied by .  Even then you would still lose .This doesnt even take into account what would happen if you had major losses with the stock they recommend  you could walk away with huge losses and your only choice to recoup your monthly  pack fee would be to continue to pay the monthly membership plan the monthly  pack plan AND make all the stock purchases they tell you to.I hope this is plain enough for you to see that this is a monumentally bad idea that could disrupt your finances for years to come.  What they are selling is information that you could gain simply by studying the stock market yourself.  If someone doesnt have the time to do so then I strongly suggest they do not trade  the stock market is not for the uneducated.,Scams,cqnvzjt,7,t5_2qrt0

Then they send you to some third party where they collect a commission on the class registration.  These kinds of things are common in certain fields.  Forklift driver road construction etc... pretty much any job where youd need some kind of weekend certification to work it.It might be a legit class.

6485700,0,t1_czq0nem,Most of this is perfect but Id stop short of suggesting that the scammer may go to her house or that this wont stop until the end of her days. Granted if I were OP I might consider telling my mother that just to get her to stop corresponding with internet strangers I swear its like were the parents now. I would also convince my mother to change her email address if she refused I would honestly crack her password and close it behind her back and never admit to doing it. I would also have zero concern for the illegal nature of this action. Random edit in this instance the small but unique selections of text I googled did not lead to a known script but Im on mobile and did not try hard.You want to make it so this particular scammer cannot contact her in the future. This scam has progressed to the point where he knows he has her on his hook now shes not just one of thousands of potential targets any more.  Shes proven herself to be gullible and fruitful. His behavior will escalate and once she stops cooperating he will probably threaten her. He will get very nasty and may  call her phonesend her threats in the mail Ive never heard of the latter happening but Ive heard of them placing calls and that can be very scary for old people obviously.Because he has so much of her information in conjunction with contacting the  credit bureaus at annualcreditreport.com which is the only official site created at the federal governments behest she needs to make sure she cannot be found on social media sites like Facebook just by typing in the same email address the scammer already has which includes any alternate email addresses she has that have an association intentionally or bytheby with it. You dont want him to be able to find her by Googling her phone number or her address or any other information she gave him. You can accomplish this by scowering the web yourself. Find all the ways your mother can be found and eliminate them. You want to be thorough but keep in mind that scammers arent typically that dedicated to a mark. If you make it more than a little difficult for them to contact your mother they will move on eventually. They are only after money they are probably not located in the same country America? as us. All that said and still presuming you are American this website provides a fantastic breakdown of how to handle her compromised identity gtpersonifying and impersonating your identity At least he was honest.,Scams,czq6431,2,t5_2qrt0

I even posted pictures of the calculator. Some person texted me about if I was selling it. I let him know that yes Im still selling it. I asked where does he live he didnt answer me. Next thing he says is that hes ready to give me a money order plus  more and that he needs my Full Name and Address. Without actually reading the safety tips on Craigslist I actually gave him my name and address. Then I told him lets not meet at my house lets meet somewhere else. He hasnt responded back to me yet. When I first did a reverse lookup on the phone number I noticed that the area code traced back to New York. So in that first thought I realized something had to be fishy about it. But I just went along with it because I was more concerned about selling my calculator than my safety. I thought the full name and address was needed for the money order. But my dad let me know that all he probably needs is my name and not the address. I feel so stupid about it and now I fear that at any point of time some guy or guys will end up coming to my house trying to break through the door or worse try to break through the windows and then try to steal things like my computer tv scanner printer modem and other things. And Im worried these guys may have guns.  I tried live chatting with an ADT representative and here is what they said to me. I am sorry to hear that! I can set up a consultation with one of our security professionals to do a no cost no obligation security review of your home.  Theyll do a walk through of your home with you and make a recommendation for a security system that fits your needs and budget. I told them That sounds great but first let me ask my dad about that as I probably need his consultation first. Then they said Okay. Have a great day.  Please click the End Chat button at top right to answer a few questions about your experience with us today.  If you have any further questions you can chat with us again or call .Of course my dad said no because he believes that the home security system will end up being more expensive than they will quote me especially if its only for a few months then theyll probably charge more.,Scams,d4j0yu5,1,t5_2qrt0

What they do is create a fake account with usually a stolen or bought ID. Then they upload inventory files that people sell on the street. These inventory files are like excel files that they upload and they can go from having  units of inventory to a  million  to a million units of indivisual products in a matter of  minutes. These sellers can be active for  days to as long as  weeks. They will sell hundreds of units of inventory an hour. What happens is Amazon will then ban the account and hold the funds for  days. What these scam artist are betting on is the people that forget or do drunk shopping. Most people will get their money back but many will not file a complaint or a return. Amazon has such a large customer data base and they sell so much that these scam artist are not making like a few hundred bucks after then  days they are making like K. All they do is repeat the proccess when the account gets shut down. They will run  accounts at a time.

10207759,0,t3_5clhjz,I came across this post and just wanted to give my experience. I can confirm it is very genuine but think very carefully. I received this letter in October and too had no recollection. Having called they advised the amount related to a speeding fine in . They advise they has written the case off many years ago and were now re adding it to the system thus I hadnt been contacted for  Years. They advised being a court fine it never goes away. They advised nonpayment would lead to jail or attachment of earnings. They advised they would only allow  days to pay. Having come off the phone understandably upset. I spoke to my partner who recalled that the debt had actually been paid to a bailiff in . I keep all paperwork and a quick electronic search I was unable to find the receipt. I contacted them again and they advised to send over a copy. Following receipt I have contacted them numerous times they wont contact you they are now saying the bailiff company drakes were bought out in  and the new company cant find the records its  years latter companies are obliged to keep for . They dont have any record on their system of it being passed to bailiffs and claim they just decided to stop contacting me I still have copies of the  letters I sent over a  year period disputing the fine . Despite me luckily having the receipt all these years latter they have advised if the new bailiff company cant find the record I will have to pay the fine again.  months after their original letter they have still not been able to confirm either way. I also expressed my issues to them that even if I pay again now there is no assurance they wont contact me with the same thing in another  years. As has been shown a receipt will mean nothing. I will keep fighting. My point is you may have incurred the fine and paid it but they are banking on you not having proof and paying up.,Scams,dc13u9a,2,t5_2qrt0

11796213,0,t3_68b7wt,Like others have said its a common fake job scam associated with a common fake check scam...The fake check scam arises from many different situations for instance you applied for a job or you are selling something on a place like Craigslist or someone wants to purchase goods or services from your business but the bottom line is always something like thisThe scammer sends you a very real looking but fake check often its a fake cashiers check.You deposit the check into your bank account and within a couple of days your bank makes some or all of the funds available to you.  This helps trick you into the false belief that the check was real.  Note that by law under most usual situations your bank must make some or all the funds available to you within a few days BUT THIS IS NOT the same thing as the check or the funds being verified or the check clearing the bank.For various and often complicated reasons depending on the specific story line of the scam the scammer will ask you to send someone who is either the scammer themselves using an alias or an accomplice of the scammer some of the money by Western Union or MoneyGram or even gift cards like iTunes gift cards.Usually within a couple of weeks but it can take as long as a couple of months your bank will realize that the check you deposited was fake and your bank will remove the funds that you deposited into your account and charge you for a bounced check fee.  If you withdrew any of the money that you deposited such that your bank account balance goes negative when the bank reverses the deposit then you will owe that money back to your bank and your bank may charge you an overdraft fee.Of course any money that you send to anyone by Western Union or MoneyGram or gift cards will be gone and unrecoverable the moment that it is picked up by the scammer or their money mule.,Scams,dgx52zw,2,t5_2qrt0
