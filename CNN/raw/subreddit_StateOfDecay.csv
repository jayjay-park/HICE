I really wish the code had an algorithm that would allow Survivors that youve trained up to have a good chance of making it back but it seems even regardless of outposts or skills youll probably lose them.,StateOfDecay,cf3ztts,1,t5_2utnn
282244,0,t3_1xbmj2,gtbut one such issue is when you got a companion costs  influence they would leave after doing hardly anything.Dont waste your time hiring people. Just go do a zed huntclear infestationetc. and use them as backup for free theyll stay with you for as long as you want regardless if they are hurt or injured until you finish their mission.gtAlso it would be nice to keep the influence you earn every day and that they stack upThe game gets too easy that way. It used to be like that and Id normally have  influence at anytime. gtThey could add coop possibly  player.I agree and would LOVE coop but it wont be coming out with this game or engine. It was initially the goal but the size of the game made it too difficult to add in coop effectively. They do plan on doing that for their next game on the Xbox which is at least a year away.gtAnd make Juggernauts more susceptible to explosives as I once threw a grenade at one after the flame fougasse basically a molotov mine seemed ineffective and it hardly did anything. Only tactic against them is to shoot them in the head multiple times with an assault rifle. They are supposed to be more difficult to kill. But there are a couple ways outside of shooting them in the head with an assault rifleYou need  moltovs or flame fougasses to kill them. One doesnt work it takes a couple.With bigger vehicles you can run them over Hit them at a slowmedium speed just enough to knock them over and then keep driving forward. Youll crush their head. The vehicle will be pretty damaged but youll still be able to drive it home to repair it.With melee weapons. Get in front of wall or fence and have them charge at you. Combat roll to the side and theyll run into the wallfence and become winded. Then start hitting their back until they stand up. Run to another side of the fence or wall and repeat. It actually doesnt take that long.gt Speaking of mines it would be nice to jury rig a grenade into a mine and be able to place it around the place to reduce hoard numbers.You mean like how outposts destroy the hordes? Or do you mean just placing random mines that would explode and kill anything that crosses it which you can already do with mines? Im confused by this suggestion.But as far as your question I would like new mapssome place new to explore.,StateOfDecay,cfa0o0o,1,t5_2utnn

Hell I used to play LeftDead on Wine on my old school MacBook years ago and it ran pretty well on medium settings until it would overheat and meltdown completely.To actually answer some of your questions if I had to guess why Skyrim runs decent but SoD wont Id say that Skyrim came out a year and a half before State of Decay and it was on a much more matured and optimized game engine. State of Decay is still relatively in its infancy and modifications to make it run better are still necessary. Its also pretty processorintensive so theres that.SoDs gotten better performancewise since its launch back in mid but it still assumes that youre running a beast of a computer. ,StateOfDecay,ci54rk9,1,t5_2utnn
1272249,0,t3_28ncwc,It all depends on your character and your playstyle. If your character is a seasoned undead killing badass he can maybe afford to take  zed or so head on without breaking a sweat. However weaker characters should probably go for the sneaking approach until they are proficient enough to take on larger numbers. Also  Guns bigger than pistols should be last resort as zed from all around will slowly move towards your general position if you go in all guns blazing and  times out of  you wont have enough ammo to last over  minutes of them scratching at the doors of the building youre in.,StateOfDecay,cicqu0x,2,t5_2utnn

A full storage area means Im not going to ditch that specific car no matter how banged up it is until I can get it back to base. I do think they could make it take a little longer to open the trunk and loadunload duffels and they could make pickups faster than cars for that purpose.

2707467,0,t3_2r1zc3,Before listing some of the methods the best thing is to remember they are fat and slow. You can outrun them easily. Walk away and theyll leave you alone. Jump a fence go inside a house etc.  If youre trying to fight them just keep a decent distance. If they charge at you hit to roll away. If they try to grab you rollyoull go right under his arm.  Its best if you can be in a house and shoot through the door because they cant fit through it. They can warp through if you leave the room or house though. If you dont NEED to fight it like for a mission dont. If you are just starting a new game and theres a big un just leave it and go on with your business. If you dont have enough ammo or weapons to fight it just dont engage them.That said heres the best ways With a high caliber gun any gun will workits just a matter of how many bullets that you need to use. Keep a distance and shoot at the head. Shooting at the stomach is a waste. If they charge roll out of the way get some distance between you and keep shooting. You can run them over. The key is to NOT HIT THEM REALLY FAST. Go slow. Just be going fast enough to knock them overand then keep going. Dont back up  just keep going over them and youll crush their head.  incendiarygrenades or  mines. Grenade launcher.  hits will kill them. During besieged missions sometimes you can lead the juggernaut away from the mission area and thatll be enough. ,StateOfDecay,cnbtuf8,2,t5_2utnn

9906341,0,t1_daynf07,First of all theres a difference between morale and moods. Morale is how the group feels overall and honestly once you start doing missions itll raise pretty quick. What you need to pay attention to is everyones individual mood. There are three types of moods good moods neutral moods and bad moods. You can tell what mood they are in when you look at the character screen itll usually have the mood and an emoticon.  Bad moods can result in survivors running away killing themselves fighting with others and then worsening their moods wasting supplies etc.  Sometimes it will trigger a mission where you give them a pep talk but note that it doesnt necessary mean it improves their mood. When you play as a character and complete missions bring in rucksacks help out other survivors when they ask for it or clear infestations it gives a chance to improve a mood by one level. So if someone is in a bad mood switch to them and either do some missions bring in rucksacks etc.  Keep everyone in a good mood and you wont have to deal with pep talk missions.  ,StateOfDecay,daytih7,1,t5_2utnn

10620554,0,t3_5rvskx,Ok now that I get what you meant. Here is the full breakdown on maximum population.Short answer  survivors if you are lucky  to be sureFirst lets take a look on how resources are used random events happen around once every  days Food  per survivor then  wasted on random events max day Medicine  per sickinjured then  wasted on random events max .day Ammo  per known horde and infestation multiplied by survivors and magic number. A safe bet is ignore the magic number and go with hordeinfestations. For safety lets consider day then random events of  .day Materials  per facilityoutpost then a fraction depending on infestations and house size. Followed by random wastes of  day. Important to notice that a material outpost generates  of any given resource but since it wastes  material a material outpost generates only  material. Fuel   unless you want to keep safe zones larger.For this case study lets take Kirkman Savani and Snyder Trumbull is known to be bad resource manager Kirkman  prebuilt facilities includes bed  slots  mandatory tower  outposts Savani  prebuilt facilities includes bed tower and library  slots and  outposts Snyder  prebuilt facilities includes bed  slots  mandatory tower and  outposts.With that in mind the best configuration for positive surplus keep in mind we need a positive surplus for the random events areKirkman Aside from  prebuilts build the infirmary greenhouse and tower to a total of  materialday  medicine outpost for that medicine surplus  material outposts to offset the consumption and add  surplus Get ammo from Tower trade Surplus  food  med  material  ammo Max population   to keep a  surplus of food.Savani Aside from  prebuilds which include bed tower and library build the infirmary and greenhouse to a total of  materialday  medicine outpost for that medicine surplus  material outposts to offset the consumption and add  surplus Get ammo from Library trade Surplus  food  med  material  ammo Max population   to keep a  surplus of food.Snyder Aside from  prebuilds which include bed build the infirmary and  greenhouses  medicine outpost for that medicine surplus   ammo outpost for ammo surplus  material outposts for a final surplus of  Surplus  food  med  material  ammo Max population   to keep a heathy  surplus of food.CONCLUSIONAt Snyder with the above mentioned configuration you can have  survivors with a good surplus of everything could try .,StateOfDecay,ddbfhfd,7,t5_2utnn
