8107839,0,t3_4q4apr,I just moved to the area and am also interested in heading up to the lake on Mount Richardson.  Judging by the BC Parks website it seems drivable for most of the way but the last  km is rough and needs  a wd.  It suggests parking and hiking the last bit.  I wonder if a local can confirm this for us.... or warn us not to try....,Sechelt,d4re6sq,1,t5_2u37v
