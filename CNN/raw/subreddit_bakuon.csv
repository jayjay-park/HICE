8537770,0,t3_4qmdcg,I dont want an electric motorbike because it feels so unsafe. Youre basically invisible on a bike why get one that doesnt even make noise? On a loudass petrol bike at least car drivers will hear you.I think the girls in Bakuon dont have them because theyre still pretty expensive. Think about it theyre all riding pretty old bikes that a high school girl would be able to afford.,bakuon,d68sdqs,1,t5_3e6b7
