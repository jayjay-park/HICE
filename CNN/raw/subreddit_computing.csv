766467,0,t1_cgrdsir,Your completely right I have thought about this heck its how I first got into computers many moons ago. But one thing I do remember when first starting is the all the hassle! to sum it up...The hassle of finding decent parts at good prices compatibility with other hardware static discharge precautions and tonnes of other stuff that for someone who is inexperienced or busy might find daunting. Yes if you have the determination the time and and the confidence to learn how to do it properly its very rewarding. That feeling after building your very first PC when it comes to life...oh god.. its like giving birth. But alot of people just dont have the drive or the time to do it they just want a great PC tailored to their needs thats where I come in. My service will give people the chance to build their own PCs with someone experienced on the other end without all the time commitments and all the hassle but at the end you still get something which is unique and personal.  It will take a while to get off the ground I know but Im not reaching for the stars just yet. At the moment it incorporating my hobby into something which could help my fellow man. Dont worry I aint quitting the day job anytime soon!,computing,cgrei0i,2,t5_2qx6z
958252,0,t1_chco3jw,Most CS programs start with Java. Java is a higher level language than C and automates several things that you would manually have to code for in C so you lose out on some understanding of what goes on under the hood but the tradeoff is the language is more approachable.Personally I say go start off with Java since itll very likely be the language youre going to use your first semester anyways. Download IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipise as your IDE as both are the heavy favorites in Java development right now.EDIT Also check out rlearnprogramming ,computing,chd7n8p,1,t5_2qx6z

2348719,0,t3_2m589d,Super sorry for the long response time and I appreciate the feedback so far. I purchased a Lenovo L. When configuring it I was suggested to get an micro hardrive with an M. GB SSD and then I decided on choosing a  GB HDD to be updraged later as my main hard drive. The computer is still in transit.   From what I understand and I could be completely wrong the idea with this setup is to store your OS and other important files on the GB SSD for quick bootup and general performance... Im guessing all my other junk should then be placed on the  GB HDD. Am I way off base in terms of understanding how to effectively run this setup? ,computing,cm20h85,1,t5_2qx6z

6151591,0,t1_cyop6mz,Mostly scripting.  I do a bit of bashpythonpowershell to manageautomate linux windows and OS X machines.  I only have to do something once if I script it.I can take a stab at Java if a client really needs me to but Ive only done that once or twice in the last year.If youre that interested in programming youd be better off going the Computer Science route than any IT major.  Yes I know youll probably have to take calculus but the two years worth of math courses have actually helped me a bit.  Youll also likely make a lot more money as a good programmer than as a good IT person.,computing,cyoved8,1,t5_2qx6z
