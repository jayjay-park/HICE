1571425,1,t3_2c9j39,Oh wow with all due respect hes a jerk... By saying that weve been eating GMOs for a long time and comparing natural selection with artificial selection doesnt justify the problem and makes him sound really doofus.People mainly complain about GMOs because the food industry and governments have been lying or hiding the that fact by not labeling the food we buy as GMOs. If GMOs are equal or safer than normal foods which studies have not been ran long enough to classify them as safe why dont they disclose it on every food item we buy?Also why doesnt he mention the problem genetically modified crops are causing to the extinction of bees for example?Not that he cares but I totally lost respect for this guy!,GMONews,cjd92o7,-3,t5_2vtem

Along with preventing further research that may reveal the extent of the damage of that information to be much more conclusive? And now when people question the legitimacy of what theyre being told about theyre food theyre uneducated and anti science? Now tell me again.. Whos crazy?,GMONews,crug1xs,1,t5_2vtem
