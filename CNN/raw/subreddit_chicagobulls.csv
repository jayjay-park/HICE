325177,0,t1_cfegqgx,I said if things go to shit. Thats means if you dont sign the big names you want you still have the option of picking up good players. And if you think the best players arent aware of teams contracts and structure of their teams then you are completely oversimplifying it. Yeah they care mostly about what they can get but if they are actual competitors they dig a little deeper. This is the problem fans have. They think things are too simple. Things should just work or not work and players dont think or care about more than the sport itself. Keeping these players probably wont win a championship. They have to do something. Make some move. Being cheap and frugle and hoping all these players develop will take too long and injuries as we have seen can dismantle that.

465622,0,t3_1zfkgx,theres a decent chance Jo is first team all nba this year. let that sink in. the bulls have arguably the best center in the league...if that doesnt warrant MIP for the bulls I dunno what does. the only one who takes that from him is Dwight and thats completely due to pts scored. but factor in assists and touches I think its pretty clear who is more valuable to the offense. and since luol was traded hes been playing like a man possessed.as for taj his post game has become magical but I think we all knew he had it in him. hes definitely shown that he should be a starter. the big surprise is that his mid range is actually coming along.jimmy has been playing really well lately and his shot selection has been much better still not much touch behind the arc though. hes been finishing at the rim much better obviously playing to his strengths. if he keeps it up hell be MIP within the season itself. it helps that hes not injured anymore.so TLDR yeah definitely Noah in my opinion.,chicagobulls,cft6y8u,11,t5_2s3uz

Which is why I feel like hed be such a perfect fit in Chicago among one of the hardest working teams in the league. Sure some of the things he says may be out of line but do you blame him? Hes on the Knicks.Plus Im sure Thibs would straighten him out if he were to come to Chicago.,chicagobulls,cfwcwu1,1,t5_2s3uz
498847,0,t1_cfwxyon,So far in the limited minutes that he has played there really hasnt been enough information collected to determine anything. I think the bulls would be better off experimenting with him and seeing if they can find a use for his incredible shooting skills while covering up his weak D. Lets say it is true that his defense is bad and the presence of his awful defense on the court costs the bulls X points per game. What if at the same time his shooting skills translate to the Bulls scoring an extra Y points per game and maybe Y is greater than X. If thats the case then the Bulls will have an overall gain on the average night and they will also have the possibility of Fredette catching fire and pulling an efficient  points out of his ass. If you put him in and hes just not shooting well then Thibs can just pull him early that night without losing much on the court since he still has all of his current nonJimmer lineups that he will use.,chicagobulls,cfwz0lq,8,t5_2s3uz

693369,0,t1_cgj0i8x,I thought it was well written.  Ive never thought Taj was great on offense its just that Boozer has progressively declined making Taj look good by comparison.  And face it when it comes to scoring as opposed to assists or offensive rebounds better than average is about as good as it gets for the Bulls offense this year.  We dont have scoring stars  none that are healthy anyway.Ill be eager to see the breakdown of Tajs defense but my first reaction is that he is often covering for Mohammed or Boozer which makes him look bad.  I have a feeling that hes great when paired with Noah but I could be wrong.  I know he was great when paired with Asik.  And he has to be better than Boozer at that end.,chicagobulls,cgj36kj,9,t5_2s3uz

726821,0,t3_22gy1b,One thing Id like to know is how often opposing players are scoring on Taj with jumpers. If they shoot a jumper they seem to hit a decent percent of them in some situations but Id like to know what proportion of possessions actually result in those high percentage shots.I agree that Taj Gibson isnt someone who can carry an offense but I dont know anyone who says he is. I think defensively hes better than the article suggests but I only have the eye test and basic stats to go by. Still the conclusion is pretty accurate I thinkgt Taj is very very good at what he does and is an extremely valuable player to the Bulls.  At the end of the day though I think hes closer to a Udonis Haslem or Mike Miller type player a good piece for a great team but not anything close to a player who can handle a real load offensively or defensively.Hes not a star but this type of player is basically what the th man award is for. Taj can come off the bench and make an impact right away. Also I think Bulls fandom mostly likes him because hes so much better than Boozer is one of our more exciting players to watch and is a hard worker.,chicagobulls,cgmw639,2,t5_2s3uz
735486,0,t3_22kzmg,First off Parsons on the Bulls makes me salivate. With that being said I think Dallas is the ideal match for Asik. If Dirk signs a contract similar to the contract Duncan signed with the Spurs they can afford Asik AND afford to sign another semibig name such as Deng.Dallas could have a starting lineup of Calderon Ellis Deng Dirk Asik next year barring they are able to pull a trade for Asik. If the West wasnt so stacked Id say that lineup could be a force to reckon with.Edit That would give them an elite perimeter defender elite post defender elite perimeter scorer elite post scorer that can also spread the floor and a serviceable point guard. They would probably be underdogs but I think that team chemistry would be ridiculous.Edit  words,chicagobulls,cgnvn4m,2,t5_2s3uz

1188007,0,t3_27q4b0,In  the Bulls were supposed to show up to the fan convention but had clinched a finals berth a night or two before. Everything was all set for them to show up at like  pm or whatever. At  they announce Phil has called a late afternoon practice and it sounds like hes keeping them late. Were sorry.   So my brother and his buddies are like Fuck it lets go to the Berto Center! Im all of  or something so Im super excited about it.  Long story short everyone came out of practice and talked to us EXCEPT for Ron Harper Scottie Pippen and Michael Jordan. In fact we got to glimpse harper and pippen  they both came over from a small back parking lot and smiled and waved.  MJ pulled up to the gate separating the back lot but at the moment the like dozen or so of us fans in the lot were casually chatting with Phil Jackson Dennis Rodman and John Salley. I was with Salley heading back to my brother who was talking to Phil and MJ FLEW through the parking lot and came within  inches  of clipping me.  Didnt even get a glimpse of him when i was looking him straighton.  Other notes from that experience John Salley was the first player out and the last to leave. He had a couple kids help him load up a ratty Volvo station wagon with boxes of shoes and clothes. Rodman was fun as hell and friendly can be. He drove an F extended with crazy glitter paint. There was talk of Phil moving on to coach New York at the time. My brothers buddy says Dont go to NEw York Phil! and he responded I plan to win this championship and enjoy it for a long time before I think about anything else. Maybe Ill stick around and win ten!  Luc Longley was almost hard to understand with his accent and he spoke very softly. And drove a modest Mercedes. Jud Buechler was like  talking to a kid on your local High School team.

1250867,0,t1_cia34vz,But I think he has to be arrogant. I see a lot of criticism of him boil down to his arrogance but in my experience you dont become absolutely amazing at something without building yourself up a littleactually a lot. Were Bulls fans. When we saw that interview years ago where Rose was like why cant I be MVP? Did we go oh God I cant believe we have this selfindulgent piece of shit on our roster? Fuck no we went nuts! We like to think of Rose as humble but hes actually an introvert whos just as arrogant as anyone. Very few people passively become great the more common way is to believe that you are great and then trying to live up to that self image.Like you mentioned too fucking Jordan. Practically universally understood to be an asshole. Kobe even more so. I dunno man I mean I just read that Grantland piece about the Lebron lovehate train. I agree that yeah he gets paid millions so when he uses his position as a pro putter of balls into hoops to say stupid shit publicly he deserves the criticism. But hes not some evil douchebag hes a selfless player an amazing athlete and his drive and determination and the way hes matured from his illconcieved hype train in Miami all add up to a pretty inspiring personality.

They go crazy spending it without thinking about their retirement at first. So the first millions are poof gone spent on houses cars and bottles of Cristal.

Tajs defense is light years ahead of Love and let us not forget Love has had a fairly injury prone career. Bulls needs a small forward and bench  thats it which really isnt much. Find a few mid level guys that can average  or so a game and I think the Bulls are set. With  mil from Boozer I think they could find  scorers.

Sure Pau is a nice addition and can score but I dont feel confident counting on Noah to score. Plus Varejao is a pretty good defense player so you have to count on him to have some sort of say.All I know is that its going to be a great matchup every time they play against each other.

1637963,0,t1_cjl27kr,I think a lot of the frustration about the Lebron era has to do with how the game is being played at the business end of things. Ideally you want the games and the post season tournament to be decided by who plays the best basketball. When the politics of the front office and superstar recruitment factor in as they do now the game gets deluded. The best basketball doesnt decide who wins and loses the best management does. As exciting as this FA season has been pushing f all night to track the latests moves Pat Riley and Phil Jackson are able to swing doesnt hold a candle to watching Jo dish inside to Taj for a poster dunk. ,chicagobulls,cjlmopq,1,t5_2s3uz

1848202,0,t3_2fqxnb,If Rose hits the ground running after FIBA this team is much better than the  team and we could outdo the  season. More realistically I think were looking at . Worst case I could see . Outside of injury I see no reason we couldnt make the NBA Finals. Yeah the cavs have Love. We have Pau and Noah. We also have Butler who is arguably the best LeBron stopper in the NBA and hopefully well have a nearMVP caliber Derrick Rose. I might be completely wrong on this next one. But what Ive seen from Doug McDermott is that his work ethic and how seriously he takes the game is out of control. I strongly believe he can be a poor mans Melo...one capable of defense. In all likelihood that wont happen this season if at all but I could totally see him being a difference maker in the playoffs. If not though I still see them making the Finals. At the core of everything though I really dont think its going to be the Cavs that bounce us out of the playoffs. ,chicagobulls,ckbwjmy,4,t5_2s3uz

Now you throw in RosePauDoug in the lineup and you have  guys that are all competent passers that also require a man on them at all times. The way our roster is set up now Jimmy is poised for a huge jump in efficiency on the offensive end.

He looks similar to Peja and he is much quicker on defense than I thought he would be.  His handles are good enough to create off the dribble and I wouldnt mind playing him at the  at all.IMO he can still more than hold his own in certain lineups at PF.

After tweaking the ankle again against the Bucks Rose is understandably sitting out a backtoback game against the worst team in the league.  Who cares?  Health is our only concern.

2441517,0,t1_cmdgglk,Theres no reason for it.  Derrick isnt a fragile piece of glass.  If he cant play he cant play.  If he gets injured he gets injured.  Thats where hes at right now and he is working to get past that stage and back into being a superstar player.  Everyone who is fretting over missed time or shortened PT is working themselves into a completely unnecessary fuss.  He didnt even aggravate anything or get injured.  He sat out to take precautions.  If you guys didnt expect stuff like this in the season then you had naive expectations.Setbacks like this were expected.  Thats just what happens when your body isnt conditioned to playing basketball for two years.  Thats why playing FIBA ball this summer was such a great thing for Rose.  When he has played this season hes been electric.  When he hasnt his body is working towards where he needs it to be.  I dont know how many fans have played sports long term or have played them competitively but this stuff just happens.  Im past my competitive playing days but even if I take a month or two off going to the park with my buddies whenever I eventually go to play a day full of games or play two days in a row my body takes a beating.  Sitting out for two years doesnt mean Rose is ready to run the gambit at full bore just because he hasnt put on mileage.  His body has to grow back into being that superstar frame it once was.  The conditioning the muscle tone the flexibility even the confidence and muscle memory.  All of that is absolutely vital and at the NBA level theres no way to get it back other than being patient.  Playing with a tweaked hammy or sprained ankle can only make matters worse.  Being cautious and patient is an absolute must.Both Derrick and the team are being cautious and being patient thats how this has to happen.  Before the season a ton of people were saying they wouldnt judge Roses play or durability until he gets past the All Star Break.  A lot even said theyd give him an entire year to be back to form.  I dont know why that patience has disappeared because of these expected setbacks.All that aside our long term goal is not to win titles with Derrick Rose being our  MPG th man.  Our goal isnt to win a title while starting Kirk Hinrich.  I havent been surprised shocked disheartened or upset about Derricks missed games.  As I said these setbacks were to be expected.  I wont be surprised disheartened or upset if something like this happens five more times.  My faith in Roses ability to reclaim his level of play and his ability to lead us to a championship are still the same.,chicagobulls,cmdh5pk,5,t5_2s3uz

2749511,0,t3_2rj7jr,We benefitted from some touch fouls while Dwight and Harden had some nocalls go against them. Both teams were physical but the Bulls got the whistle the vast majority of the time. At the end there were some egregious nocalls Rose got hacked on a few drives the CLEAR out of bounds call they missed. It probably came down to the fact that we would give up a layup instead of risking the and. Also a fair share of their points in the paint came from offensive rebounds where our guys were just boxing out and jostling for position instead of trying to stop an opponents shot. Just my take.The thing I dont buy is this notion Ive seen that the Rockets outplayed us but we were gifted a win through free throws. The Rockets had a lead late in the th and then completely choked while the Bulls hit shots and clamped down on defense. The two teams employed different strategies. I do think the refs shafted Houston a bit but they still had a chance to win and blew it.,chicagobulls,cnglw3f,0,t5_2s3uz

2782221,0,t3_2rxh80,One thing I will say is that I think Washington is a terrible terrible matchup for us and that if we play them in the playoffs I wont be optimistic about winning. Their guards can get into the lane at will and when we have to slide our bigs to help Nene and Gortat can hit jumpers. One play that pretty much summed up this game was sometime in the fourth. I think we went on one of our mini runs and they just needed to get a quick bucket. They ran a quick pick with Gortat and Wall going to the right with Nene sitting on the strong side baseline. Rose didnt get through the screens well shocker and Taj had to slide over and over help. They popped the screener got him the ball and then Jo came up to contest and left Nene on the baseline. Nene saw this and just slipped to the bucket for an easy dunk from the Gortat feed while Taj was still over by Wall at the free throw line extended. When ball action gets isolated to one side like this and their shooters are hitting on kick outs we pretty much have to rely on the three strong side defenders to get the job done. Im a firm believer in defense starts at the point of attack and once Derrick digs in a little more up top well be able to contain their quick ball movement and hilow action much better. ,chicagobulls,cnkbuvs,7,t5_2s3uz

Basically Kirk has sucked all year and hes getting paid more than the vet minimum to do it for some reason.Youre not wrong about Snell the only tool hes missing is confidence and he wont get that without minutes played.  The more hes played the better hes looked.  I dont think Niko is severely overrated even in the recent slump hes one of the better big men rookies in the last decade.The Pau defensive situation is a symptom of league evolution and matchup problems.  Pau is a lumbering  footer and cant guard stretch fours meaning Taj or Jo end up dragged out of the paint leaving Pau to get outmuscled by bigger guys inside.  Despite this problem of some bad matchups and games Pau has been a betterthanaverage post defender this year and is currently th in DWS.  ,chicagobulls,cnw6hno,3,t5_2s3uz

I know a lot of this has to do with Dunleavy having been out.

At this point I wish there was a way I could thank D Rose directly and let him know Im grateful for his service. Its not fair that ligaments and tendons affected his greatness. I wont forget what he has done for us. Also the selfish fan in me hopes he works out this  week timetable and comes back right as the playoffs are starting ready to fk the whole league up.

Of course we would loose his rebounding and defense but its just a thought.

3259996,0,t1_coz5hvp,You are very wrong. A meniscus repair and a meniscectomy are  separate procedures with two VERY different recover timelines. Repairs take MONTHS to come back from Meniscectomies take only weeks. Actual scientific source and not a sports blog If the meniscus was removed it generally takes  weeks to return to full activities.If the cartilage was repaired it can take up to four months for full recovery. The goal of the first week is to reduce pain and swelling. After this the goals are to increase range of motion and weightbearing. Physical therapy is often done several times a week for four weeks or more. At  weeks low impact activities can often be added. This will help to prepare you to return to sports or activities. Running cutting and rotation are avoided for at least  weeks.Edit you are right that Westbrook did have a Repair at one time but it was during the off season and he was not playing for  months.  He has had  partial Meniscectomies. Here is an EXCELLENT source on Meniscus injury repair options that is very easy to read.  It will clear up a lot of confusion on the topic.

So given that where in a trade would he sign off on that would allow FO to get what they would want top  pick and allow Thibs to win now? There really is nowhere for him to go. Now then unless there is a title somewhere in the next  years I would say Thibs probably walks at the end of this contract. Even with a title it may not end with him staying here. Fact is there may be a painful rebuild coming in  or three years. Not as painful as  but definitely a few lotterys on the horizon.

3740743,0,t3_3394re,gtAt one point in their shared podium appearance after their stellar performances in Game  Derrick Rose leaned over to Jimmy Butler and said This is so awkward. Butler laughed and replied Yeah it is.gtThe Bulls backcourt mates were referencing the formal nature of the news conference which is different than the more casual conversations that take place at lockers after regularseason games.gtBut they couldve been talking about playing together given how infrequently it has occurred. Mondays Game  will mark just the th time this season that Rose and Butler have started together.gtLuckily for the Bulls their production belied the paucity of the pairing.gtRose and Butler combined for  points and  assists in Game  delivering several momentumchanging moments.gtIts good to have them out there coach Tom Thibodeau said. And theyre similar in the sense they combine the power with the speed. And they play off each other well. The more they play together the better it will be.gtThis was the season Roses return and Butlers emergence as a primary scorer were going to catapult the duo into the discussion of the leagues best backcourt. Instead Butlers left elbow injury and Roses torn right meniscus kept that title in the Bay Area with Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson.gtBut in lieu of that title stacking playoff victories will have to suffice for now.gtJimmy has had a terrific season all season long Thibodeau said. For Derrick I thought he was playing great basketball right before the AllStar break. He had to battle through the injury. Were hopeful he can get back to that high level. Just Derrick on the floor helps our team a ton. When hes playing well our team goes to a different level.gtRose curiously talked about not drawing double teams in Game  despite the Bucks trapping him on most every pickandroll. Though he still has a tendency for jump passes Rose also has the ability to complete some of those particularly of the crosscourt variety.gtThat ability and drawing so much defensive attention leaves open looks for others.gtHe was a little timid at first but then he got into his rhythm and attacked the basket Taj Gibson said of Rose. Thats a sight to see when he attacks the basket. Thats what we need from him. And he got Jimmy going.gtIndeed Rose assisted on three of Butlers eight field goals including both of his pointers.gtI always tell him to shoot the pointer because its something he works on all the time Rose said. And when I pitched it back to him or skipped it to him a couple of times he pulled the trigger. With our offense when youre open the game will tell you to shoot. I just love the way hes playing.gtButler finished sixth in the regular season by averaging . freethrow attempts per game and got to the line eight times in Game . Rose attempted only two free throws and it wouldnt be a surprise if the Bucks attempted to be more physical in Game .gtBucks coach Jason Kidd employs a trapping defense adept at adjustments. Limiting Roses penetration likely will top his list.gtPeople have been physical with Derrick before Thibodeau said. Derrick has a very unique skill set because he combines the power and strength with the speed and quickness. That type of stuff he handles very well. Derrick doesnt get too high or too low.gtNeither apparently does Butler.gtAs long as we stay healthy and everyone keeps his confidence high I think its going to be tough for teams to key in on any one guy because we have so many guys who do so many things well Butler said. If we just keep playing team basketball we will continue to win.,chicagobulls,cqio3r1,28,t5_2s3uz

I know thats biting but like you said the blame should not be on the player. Its true lebron complains but sometimes he gets mauled on drives. It is what it is. If these bulls completely pull away these little fouls dont really matter. I hope they are able to play through it and finish up with these next . We may never beat lebron if we dont do it this season. I mean he will probably be on the decline by the end of next year. But Boston is getting better PG is back Orlando and The Bucks in a few years will be looking to shock. So our time is now I mean its not like we are done after this season.

3944347,0,t1_cr5vsu5,Well partially LeBron but Id say Tyronn Lue is the real one calling shots behind the scenes.

3945491,0,t3_35nbo8,Watch the video.  You can see the ref where the ball is being inbounded shaking his head no and gesturing that the Cavs should inbound as Blatt attempts to call a time out.  It sure seems like he was reacting to Blatt.Edit However as I understand it the report wont disagree with the call or noncall on the floor unless there is clear evidence it was wrong the same standard they use during replays.  So yes they do give the benefit of the doubt to the way it was called during the games.  But they do that in every report.,chicagobulls,cr60q8e,13,t5_2s3uz

3965606,0,t3_35vx0u,Yea I listened he made some good points wilbon is a good guy its tough listening to him when you got those  fucking retards lovely radio hosts ranting in the background waddlesilvy though.Remember one other point he made though... that people feel when the bulls are all on the same page and hitting their stride the offense becomes completely unstoppable. Problem is even the smallest bit of drama causes this offense to fall apart. We consistently will perform amazing offense for say  minutes then a few things go wrong and bam a  minute drought. They just arent mentally tough. Every time this drought starts happening rose starts looking to save the day since honestly he kind of has to and bam rose now drops to  shooting. Thats his fault too for sure but sometimes fuck man... I just look around on the floor and I wish I could suit up and help my brother out there because no one else fking came to play. I was the person spamming  in game threads HAS ANYONE SEEN JIMMY BUTLER BEEN MIA SINCE GAME  HAS HE ENTERED THE BUILDING YET? and for good reason. He was barely alive till the second half of the game. Being in foul trouble doesnt excuse you from not driving to the paint.He also noted something else though that I have been complaoining about for a while. That none of our guys really have that fight in them anymore. That fight they had back in . Or even the last  years. Honestly from the way they act on the court? I would agree. This team doesnt seem to give a shit and if they really do and this is just their performance? that makes me even sadder as this is a pathetic performance. You can see it in the changing attitude on these boards too. We are slowly progressing from making excuses for these guys to straight up being pissed at their poor showing. We have every right to be we expected more than this.Sorry but I thought AUSTIN RIVERS had more fight in him against the rockets when cp was out than jimmy butler or the rest of this team have in them combined minus rose i love rose.This offense needs to transition into give derrick the ball and have everyone run around cutting and setting picks. Noah doesnt need the ball in his hands. Right now our offense is give the ball to rose and have everyone stand around or give the ball to noah and have everyone stand around. What I dont get is that games were we performed great  like the bucks game or parts of game  v cavs we had tons of assists and a free flowing offense. Wtf happens to destroy that all of a sudden? i just dont get how it disapears every other game. That leads me to put the blame on the players.  STEP THE FUCK UP BULLSOne more little thing I wanted to add... If i have to see taj gibsons patented Let me dribble atleast one time instead of going up for a dunk for some retarded reason so I can get stripped move I will just turn off the television.I think lebron literally demoralized this group they dont want to admit it but they just look like a bunch of pussys out there if I can be as blunt as I want to be right now. This next game I am hoping rose drops  and we can edge out a win im not really anticipating or letting my hopes get high for anyone else showing up because honestly I just dont care for them anymore. Give me healthy Wes Mathews or hurts me to say it draymond green any day for this series he will play every minute like his life depended on it.

3966656,0,t1_cr8b9x0,Its a little more than that.There is no trust on offense. Pau is the only one who trusts everyone on the team and can get them the ball. Hes also the only one that can send a pass to every player in a position for them to receive it and score.Rose and Butler cant pass into the paint. Noah cant pass out of the pick and roll or to guys on the wing. Rose and Hinrich are the only ones who can throw an alleyoop. Dunleavy Hinrich and Noah are the only ones who can pass to a backdoor cut.Its nothing against these guys they have their individual talents but when you dont trust the next player to score or make the best play the ball stops moving. We need the ball to move at all times because we cant make difficult passes. We need that ball to move so players can make the passes they are skilled at. When the ball stops moving because you dont trust your team your whole team stops moving. Thats why we see all the standing around waiting for Rose Butler or godforbid Noah to play hero ball. We miss a few shots that trust goes away and then we dont score for  minutes at a time.,chicagobulls,cr8fl6f,2,t5_2s3uz

He got transfers from Minnesota White Penn State Babb Marshall Kane UNLV DejeanJones and many others.  It doesnt really matter but I thought Id mention it.Id say it translates to the NBA in that he should hopefully be able to bring out and maximize talent where other coaches may have failed or never tried.  Realistically this may mean as others have mentioned people like Snell Dougie Niko etc showing improvement in the next few years.  Shooting for the stars a bit it may mean Pau playing in a role that suits not only his skills but desires as well. Also if the rumors that Butler and Rose have issues are in any way true Id expect Fred to be able to use both of them in a way that satisfies them keeps them and their play styles from clashing while keeping the team playing well.I know all of that sounds like Im painting him to be the Basketball Messiah but to ISU he kind of was.

Noah never rounds into any form and wastes away on the bench as Rose tries his hardest to lead a weak defensive team to the  seed in the East.

His shooting has been abysmal.  We dont need him in the paint doing  inch vertical floaters. We need his outside shooting.  might be a small sample size but luckily we have more than that. He was ass the entirety of last season in his limited time add to that his summer league and the ass shooting just continues. IDK whats wrong with the guy,chicagobulls,ct3kavo,0,t5_2s3uz

Just let us play together.  JBThe only rumors of negativity between Butler amp Rose come from Cowley or those piggybacking Cowley who dont know any better.  The person starting amp spreading these rumors has no credibility reporting on the Chicago Bulls.  Chicago SunTimes and Joe Cowley specifically have a history of stirring the pot with false or exaggerated drama.  Anyone who is dismissing this is doing so because Cowleys BS has amounted to nothing multiple times in the past.

They still won  games sure in the East but they won  games by underachieving. Im really liking the offensive sets in these first two games and Im excited to see what happens when Pau and Rose are back then hopefully adding in the reliability of Dunleavy. If they take a hit defensively I dont expect it to be a huge hit though and improve offensively which I feel they will by ASB then they can be an elite team and a legitimate contender even in Hoibergs first year. ,chicagobulls,cvu7dwl,5,t5_2s3uz

5546157,0,t1_cwkiqx4,Seriously. I dont think Rose is ever coming back to be a top  point guard in this league. The only shots he can make are difficultcontested layups where he kind of bullies his way in there. He doesnt have that finesse that made him so incredible to watch. He is atrocious shooting the ball from anywhere outside  feet and his floater that used to be lethal isnt dropping. Plus he just isnt setting his teammates up when his offense isnt working. He has the tools to be a playmaker but I think Rose will always have the scoring PG mentality that worked earlier in his career. Finally I really think rose should get more criticism for that last shot vs the Pistons. He had double vision and took a jump shot and later said he wasnt sure which basket he was shooting at. Just drive man. Anything is better than you shooting at a phantom basket.,chicagobulls,cwkjvo3,-14,t5_2s3uz

5612654,0,t3_3rzwyn,Rebound is whenever someone obtains control over the ball after a missed FG the exact definition of control is subjective and Ill get to that in a second. A put back does count as an offensive rebound. A missed tip in can count as both a rebound and a missed FG as well. But its important to note and this goes with both the question of who gets rewarded the rebound as well as your assist question there is a lot of subjectivity in deciding these stats. The exact rules are pretty vague and the individual NBA statisticians at the arenas are given quite a bit of leeway in deciding what counts as what. This is why there are some welldocumented cases of players getting preferential treatment in the box score when playing at home such as being rewarded more assists than they would at an away arena. So telling you the exact moment when its no longer an assist or which tip ins are counted as a rebound attempt is hard. These stats can be reviewed and changed both during the game and even well after but its not overly common. Heres a crazy example of it actually happening when a redditor got a triple double game from Lebron undone ,chicagobulls,cwssy97,7,t5_2s3uz
5623775,0,t1_cwspaoq,I will say this as someone who also unconditionally loves Rose and has and will defend him until the day he retires Hes too up his own ass about the facilitation thing. From what I can tell he thinks he can switch between being Chris Paul and Russell Westbrook on any given night. He always talks about the type of player he is and how hes best when hes attacking and playing downhill but then in the same breath talk about how his role is facilitation and distribution and getting his teammates going. The team has not been able to deal with this schizophrenic approach to whatever Rose wants to do that night. I remember the first preseason game Rose played this year and he scored  points in just under  minutes of play. Someone on this sub said This team is only going as far as Rose takes them. Its absolutely true. He needs to just decide hes throwing this team on his back and carrying them just like in . Only this time the talent is there through the whole roster.

And he doesnt have to play big minutes we can run  each of Kirk  Moore  Brooks or something like that maybe a bit more since Moore tends to back up Jimmy now with Mike still out.Phoenix has an elite back court so we could get wrecked but if Jimmy is on his game and at least one of Pau  Niko shows up we could be ok.  ,chicagobulls,cx4yiye,-1,t5_2s3uz

Unfortunately injuries have robbed him from becoming the face of the league and have made him more or less of a punch line. Derrick in my eyes still can be the Windy City assassin. If Hoiberg can manage his minutes effectively and keep him fresh for the playoffs this team could be finally in for the deep playoff run weve been desperately wanting. Derricks makeup reminds me alot of Kobe minus being an asshole to his teammates. People criticize for not recruiting superstars to come play with him but frankly I love the fact that he doesnt want to take any shortcuts to a ring. Can Derrick be a franchise player still? I doubt it but he believes he can and I respect him for it. There is nothing I would love more than to see Derrick bring a championship to Chicago and redeem himself it honestly would be a story book ending.

DRose is most likely the worst starting point guard right now Gasol is not playing at the same level as last year Noah is healthy but not quite the same guy as before Niko looks like hes lost out there and Snell is more invisible than Keith Bogans was. Doug has been a pleasant surprise this year and Jimmy is playing at the same level as before on offense but hes playing with the same defensive intensity as his first two years.

Fred has him bring up the ball and dump it off and often it doesnt come back to him.  I think thats how Freds offense is and sometimes people mistake it for poor effort.

6042242,0,t1_cybh7js,Lets ask another fundamental question here do you think people like to get called out in any capacity whether its at practice or through the media?  You dont like it.  This is also why its motivating and when I say that its motivating realize that these are HIGHLY COMPETITIVE people.  These are the types of things that actually motivate them.  This isnt a  to  job where half of the task is just showing up.  This is a place where you got to where you are BECAUSE of your competitiveness.  This wasnt the first time that these players have been called out and it wont be the last time.  Hell Thibs coached most of these guys and that guy screamed at them more than their mothers.Lets look at something else here John Paxson came out talking about the State of the Bulls Team and one of the comments that he made was Weve given Tony Snell an opportunity. And Tony has had a few moments but to be very candid he has needed to play better and with some more consistency.This comment directly called out a player.  Jimmys comments didnt even call out a single player he said that everyone needed to work harder including himself.  The closest thing to calling someone out was in reference to the coach.  I just dont actually know why people are so upset about his comments.  The ONLY answer that makes any sense is that its because of the media surrounding it that blew it up.  I mean for fucks sake Friedell is calling to have Butler traded because of it and thats just ignorant.  Id rather that Friedell would get traded hes basically turned into Jerry Springer with how hes manufacturing attention.,chicagobulls,cybnbid,1,t5_2s3uz

6116841,0,t1_cykv8qd,Thought that was a great moment. I think an often underestimated aspect of the Bulls chemistry issues has been Pau. Hes obviously an esteemed veteran and a true NBA champion but the guys in our locker room have been around Chicsgo forever and I just could never imagine them falling in line behind the aging Spanish superstar. Pau has to learn how to lead from behind and throw his weight into the culture of this team in the right places and he does a GREAT job of that here bringing everyone in together like that. Giving props to JGB for a phenomenal performance that led to an important victory. ,chicagobulls,cykx6ii,16,t5_2s3uz

And the same people are the same way with other players too.  They dont seem to realize that this is a long season and what happens before the Christmas game is not necessarily going to be telling of what the season will end up looking like as a whole.

6148898,0,t1_cyngl6w,gt We could move Mirotic back to the SF position which is his natural position so maybe he could build upon the momentum that hes been gaining these past couple of gamesFor being a new fan this is some heady insight.I like Dunleavy a lot.  Hes not flashy but he does everything better than average and most importantly makes his teammates better which is hard to do from the SF position.  I dont think we can trade him until he plays a few games at which point I dont think people will want to trade him as I see him as the perfect fit fo the Hoiberg system and his height  and skill set make for a LOT of interesting line ups that can be had.,chicagobulls,cyokd07,1,t5_2s3uz

6397503,0,t1_czgptzz,Yes. What people dont realize is that D Rose has actually changed up his game this year. Hes taking less pointers that kills possessions especially the ones off the dribble and in transition which he is historically terrible at. In fact I think  of his threes have been assisted. Hes just getting into the lane. Ive loved the way hes playing this year and had no question he can return to his  Playoff form. Only criticism I have is when he dribbles up court passes the ball to someone and then camps out in the corner. I dont know if thats him or Hoiberg,chicagobulls,czgtwg6,15,t5_2s3uz

6420634,0,t3_43mwif,Itd be unlikely.  Wed have to play significantly better than we have so far and I dont see any reasons to think this team magically turns it on.  Even if the players became consistent we still have glaring deficiencies in our rotations schemes and coaching decisions that have thrown away Ws all season.  Boston Detroit etc those close losses to beatable teams can be attributed to specific Hoiberg mistakes and it happens far too often.  Even a huge blowout like this afternoon was affected largely by Freds decision to hack DJ give up free points stall our offense and then dig the hole deeper by pulling an effective group so Aaron Brooks could matchup with Jamal Crawford and start his fire.And as banged up as we currently are no Dun amp Jo we were probably more banged up last season.  No Rose for  games.  No Jimmy Dun or Taj for  weeks a piece.  Jo missed around  games but was hobbled when he did play.  Doug missed more than half the season with a torn meniscus.  Taj was ineffective when he did come back to play thanks to the torn ankle ligament.Taking a step back and being worse than we were last year is disastrous.  Especially when young guys were being held back by Thibs and were supposed to flourish in more prominent roles Snell Mirotic Doug.  Turns out they werent given more prominent roles because they clearly dont deserve them.,chicagobulls,czjfhuh,2,t5_2s3uz

6426338,0,t3_43py5g,I think he actually regressed from last year. Or at the very least his slope of progression has been dramatically slowed. If last year he was showing the early signs of an exponential increase to a solid NBA career he is now showing signs of being a frustratingly inconsistent player who will progress to become a fringe starter for his career.He shows a lot of good flashes yes. There are games when he is attacking the paint and putting up numbers and if his  is falling it allows his whole game to connect.But then there are those games when he goes like  from downtown with  points. He settles way to frequently for a terrible jump shot with  on the clock. He will resort to the arm flail to try and draw a foul instead of playing through contact inside. His basketball IQ at times is dismal.I still have hope. How he plays after the injury and all star break will be very insightful,chicagobulls,czk0r8r,1,t5_2s3uz

Unfortunately I didnt have enough hair to care about using any by the time it became more popular. Used to have to go to salons way back in the day but now you can easily pick them up at walmart.its one of the best products Ive ever used you get just the right amount of the gel look without it looking wet it looks more shiny and healthy but not like you stepped out of a shower it holds in place ridiculously well never flaked and I didnt have to use much to be effective it also smelled great but thats probably more preference.

6722191,0,t3_47o960,TLDR  probably not that different.  Essentially wed trade Mirotic for Melo not directly and otherwise maintain the same roster. We maybe get a little farther last season but no guarantees and no rings.I think signing him would have triggered some other moves as well.  One of those would have been to go after Pau.  We wouldnt have been able to sign him or Mirotic because we wouldnt have had cap room.  So I think we propose a sign and trade with the Lakers where we send the rights to Niko for Pau.  That gives us a Rose Butler Melo Noah and Gasol lineup with Taj McDermott Dunleavy Brooks and Hinrich off the bench.  Bairstow probably is still around and we probably try to sign a veteran center in addition.  I actually think we would have signed Butler to an extension earlier on.  There would have been  chance for cap room last summer so maybe the Bulls sign Butler to something in the  year  million dollar range I see us signing Melo as increasing Butlers leverage because we would have been cap strapped to do anything else.  There is of course the possibility that our FO still low balls Butler and ends up paying the higher amount in the summer of  but we wouldnt have had any cap space so we wouldve signed him or matched any offer for sure.In terms of our production I think we have a better chance of getting out of the east but that Warriors team was great last year and I dont think we get a championship.  Assuming injuries more or less stay the same Melo Butler and Rose all sat out games so maybe our regular season record is a little better but maybe not.  Melo played only  games last year some of that was tanking but he probably wasnt playing more than  regular season games Jimmy sat out  games Rose missed .  That probably means were still looking at the  seed maybe even falling into the  or .  If we get the  seed we beat the Bucks similarly and I think we wouldve have a real chance to beat the Cavs again we were almost up  in that series.  We wouldve beat the Hawks too so wed be in the finals where I think we lose to the Warriors.  Get that far and Thibs is probably our coach though then again Blatt isnt coaching Cleveland anymore so maybe not.  Falling to the  or  wouldve meant a matchup with the Wizards in round .  That wouldve been tough that team was so much better than this years Wizards but were probably favorites and likely win in  or .  We then beat the Hawks and again a showdown with the Cavs in the ECF.  Either way though I think the team maxes out at a finals loss.Interestingly we couldve ended up with Bobby Portis all over again. Maybe we do a little better in free agency last summer and catch an older guy who wants a ring so he signs a minimum contract David West or Mo Williams both did that anyways and maybe we get a chance at them instead of the Spurs and Cavs.  This would be the season to get things done for the Bulls and it would be the Bulls and Cavs as clear favorites in the East.  But the problem is the Warriors still exist so while we have a shot at a ring were not favorites by any means.  Ultimately signing Melo gives us more hope and a little less anxiety this season but probably not much else.,chicagobulls,d0ems52,1,t5_2s3uz

6729637,0,t3_47sgrb,Snell just doesnt have what it takes to be consistent. Brooks at one point in time used to be a sparkplug. Now I just cant stand seeing him on the court if he cant even do that. Hes Tina Turner on the defensive end. And his one positive his offense just isnt thete.

6786805,0,t3_48pud5,Does this team not get scouting reports? Its amazing to me how clueless they are about other players tendencies. Dunleavy even mentioned this after the game. I know Thibs was a nut who watched film all the time but why dont the Bulls have someone doing a little bit of scouting?,chicagobulls,d0lklhm,4,t5_2s3uz
6805151,0,t3_48t2b8,gtEveryone acting like everything would be better under Thibs. Theres this sub using that word again..gtOur players are still suffering from wear and tear of every day practices for  years which contributes to them being so oftinjured.Thats a silly completely false and completely unsubstantiated media narrative that was born out of IN GAME minute totals.  Which only ever affected Jimmy Butler and Luol Deng anyway.  One of those guys is very healthy and very productive in the latter stage of his career.  The other has experienced contact injuries in the past two seasons.  Theres no amount of rest that can prevent you from hurting yourself on a DeAndre Jordan screen like JB did last year.To a significantly lesser extent people have made cases for Joakim Noah too but his minute totals had to do with GarPax letting Asik walk and not finding a replacement.  We couldve drafted Gobert Plumlee Ezeli Draymond Dieng over SnellTeague.  We couldve signed a free agent backup to Jo that wasnt old enough to be in his th season instead Nazr Mohammed. year old Mike Dunleavy went on record saying the Thibs stuff was silly and specifically that Toms practices were the easiest hed had in his NBA career.  He expounded saying that Tom is smart saves guys legs for the long season and lets them go all out in games.  Thibs never ran unnecessarily grueling practices he never burned guys out off court.  The tough thing about his practices was discipline.  He wanted to instill strict lessons in the team engrain the principles into them that he wanted so they could instinctively fall back on them in the heat of the moment.gtNot to mention did any of you fucking watch the playoffs last year? Yes did you!?  You act like it was an embarrassment to beat the Bucks but not sweep them.  How nuts.  Milwaukee was st in forcing turnovers last season top  in OppFG and a top  defense overall.  They were a formidable team not a pushover sweep.  We still beat them in  games by a margin of ..  Thats not good enough for some of you but the job Freds doing is?? Crazy.gtWe gave up against the BucksGave up by giving Milwaukee an absolutely brutal beatdown in Game .  Do some of yall watch the Chicago Bulls?  Do you think this team has stacked talent to sweep their way to ECF dust off Lebron James and hoist the Larry OBrien over Currys beaten body of something?Sometimes the team just isnt that good.  Aaron Brooks was a complete disaster in the playoffs.  We had to mirror Derrick Roses minutes to any decent opposing PG and some who werent even decent they were just big!  All because Aaron turned playoff games into layup lines and his offense didnt even come close to making up for it.Milwaukee in the playoffs last year mightve been the most underrated team to make the  postseason the way some people take about them.  As if this Bulls juggernaut with Butler returning from injury Rose from knee surgery a bench of BrooksSnellrookie Mirotic who got injured in that series would just sweep these weak Bucks no problem?  Speaking of BrooksSnellNiko that backbone trio of our reserve unit combined to shoot  in last years playoffs.  .  Thats  on a significant amount of attempts a lot from SnellNiko coming off easy look created by attention RoseButlerPau drew.  Thats part of the lack of talent.  Thibs cant make shots for these guys.Milwaukee had their backs against the wall and dug down to win one game.  Congratulations that always happens in basketball.  Remember the  Spurs?  They went to a Game  in the st round against a  win Dallas team that started Calderon Dalembert Ellis amp Marion.  SAS didnt play another Game  the rest of the playoffs even in the Finals against Miami.  The Bucks were a better team than people gave them credit for but even then we dusted them off in a historic beatdown  in the elimination game and only lost Game  on a last second play.  People ITT crazy to cite a series we WON by a margin of . points as a knock against Thibs.Our point margin in th quarters under Hoiberg is . th in the NBA.  Were even worse on the road at . th choking in games down the stretch.  We were nd in the league at . under Thibs last year better than CLE SAS GSW ATL MEM HOU etc.No one lamenting Thibs firing is thinking that wed be on the way to title town if you replaced him with Fred this year.  We just realize what we gave up in an incredible head coach a developer of talent a potential head of a franchise and a great basketball mind.  Either way this roster is flawed.  Either way Chicago is in need of a retool a rebuild whatever you want to call it.  The only thing that upsets people is we couldve undergone that retooling with the guidance of a great basketball mind and a proven elite coach.  Hoiberg isnt a bad guy.  He may eventually one day be a good NBA head coach.  He isnt right now.  We now have an uncertain roster going into the future with an uncertain coach steering the ship.  Were hoping two things pan out instead of one now and thats the difference.  Its not romanticising of Thibs or an unrealistic view of what we would do with him at the helm.  This isnt hindsight either plenty of people were advocating for the Thibs job last season including after the playoffs.  Most just realized Tom was going to play the scapegoat regardless as Reinsdorf pushed the rd consecutive coach he hired then turned on out the door.,chicagobulls,d0nnpo4,11,t5_2s3uz

7028236,0,t1_d1cqv1b,Rose has always been underrated on the defensive end and hes been one of the top defensive PGs both this year and in his MVP season. Media and fans have never given him the props he deserves when other guys get reputations as defenders and never lose them.As far as isolation defense is concerned theres no PG Id trust more to lock up an opposing PG for an endofgame stop than Derrick Rose.  In that aspect of defensive play I feel Rose is elite and hell go toe to toe with any top PG Curry Westbrook Paul Wall Lowry.  Rose thrives in headtohead PG matchups and can stay in front of the toughest covers.  Comparatively other top PG defenders have more flaws.  Conley amp Paul lack the size Hill amp Rubio lack the outright quicknessspeed Westbrook lacks the discipline.  Rose isnt the perfect PG defender but he has a great balance IMO and his strengths outweigh his weaknesses.With the prevalence of screening in the NBA isolation defense is sometimes underappreciated.  But even in PnR Derrick is a good defender.  Opposing ball handlers have an eFG of . when Rose defends them in the PnR better percentage than Rondo Wall Paul Lowry Butler Curry George Hill.  Opponents score . Points Per Possession on plays where Rose is the primary defender of the ball handler in Pick n Roll situations too equivalent to Hill Paul amp better than Bledsoe Conley Rondo KCP Klay Butler.  Defense on PnR ball handlers is extremely important because these plays account for roughly  of offensive plays in the NBA which is second only to spot up FGAs.  These numbers alone arent indicative that Rose is an outright better defender than these players just as they arent an indicator that players with better numbers are better defenders than Rose.  They are just one resource and one nonsubjective source I can cite.But thats what the numbers tell me that Derrick is at least a good defensive player.  My eyes tell me he is definitely a good defensive player.  In PnR Derrick has the size strength and athleticism to get over screens.  Rose excels specifically at tailing the shooter whether hes put into an off ball screen or on ball screen and getting around to contest a FGA.  If the opponent doesnt hoist up a FGA Derrick can steer his dribble into help or force them to pass the ball away.  Derrick is not Scottie Pippen and he is not a flawless defender but even when he has lapses his athleticism still allows him to quickly recover and make up ground where other guards would take themselves out of the play.  Injuries or no injuries Roses quickness is still off the charts at the NBA level.Something else the stats and numbers dont account for is that defending the Pick n Roll is a team job.  Pau Gasol is a  year old  footer and hes defending these plays with Derrick the majority of the time.  Theres not much debate behind what kind of defender Pau Gasol is not a good one unless he is very specifically using his length at the rim.  In todays league it is very important for bigs to step up on the PnR.  Some teams hedge more aggressively than others in certain matchups teams trap but a slow footed big like Pau Gasol really limits what you can accomplish defensively against PnR.  Sometimes people see a ball handler get loose off the screen for this reason and chalk it up to bad on ball defense.  Theres just not a whole lot that any PG can do to lock down a PnR if they arent getting help from their defensive scheme and the teammate charged with help.Derrick is also very good at getting himself in position to take a charge both on help rotations and in transition.  This is possibly the most underrated attribute of Derricks defensive toolbox.  Obviously no stat exists for  of charges drawn when there is an opportunity to draw a charge but in the last two seasons I think Rose has been the best charge drawing PG in the league not necessarily drawn the most overall.  Derrick also has the size and strength to help his team defensively on the glass more than most guards.  Raw rebounding numbers and even rebounding percentages wont capture this but Rose helps Chicago turn a rebound into transition offense more than anyone on the team can.  Thats not strictly play defenseget stop but rebounding is surely still a factor when crediting a players overall ability on D.  Rose also grabs a lot of rebounds both offensive amp defensive that he has no business getting.  There are times when Rose will leap above opposing big men to snatch away an otherwise easy rebound.  Not many PGs are bringing that impact to the table outside of Rose Westbrook sometimes Wall.  The ability to snatch contested rebounds for your team and avoid giving up second chance points is a vital part of defense at any position.  Its very valuable when you actually get it from your PG spot and more so when you can turn that value into offensive opportunities.Size and strength at the  helps Derrick hold his ground in the post very effectively too.  Ive watched every Bulls game since before Rose was drafted and teams dont seek him out for post plays in his matchup.  Hell occasionally get caught on a tall forward during a switch and even then Derrick is capable of staying big holding his base and not fouling.  And in general Rose knows not to foul.  Hes not someone who hacks down on an opponent when theyre driving he doesnt gamble high on outside screens for steals he doesnt often jump passing lanes.  He has a similar approach to Luol Deng.  Just in the sense that he plays strong positional defense doesnt rack up defensive box score stats and denies his opponent open looks.  It was even frustrating to watch FredBoylens defense double Melo off the catch in these past two games as Derrick got cross matched on him.  Not that Rose is a lockdown defender even for Melo but he is a capable individual defender and without even forcing Carmello to prove he can make a shot on the Bulls D was giving open looks to Porzingis Afflalo and Calderon.Defensive metrics are flawed and unreliable especially for PGs.  Defensive highlight reels dont exist much unless youre racking up steals and blocks.  So you just have to watch enough Bulls games to see Roses individual defense.Some examples of Derricks defense.Opposing PGs career scoring vs Derrick RoseKyrie Irving  . PPG  . FGBrandon Jennings  . PPG  . FGMike Conley   PPG  . FGRussell Westbrook  . PPG   FGDeron Williams  . PPG   FGJohn Wall   PPG   FGKyle Lowry   PPG   FGGoran Dragic  . PPG  . FGJeff Teague  . PPG   FGKemba Walker  . PPG  . FGIsaiah Thomas  . PPG  . FGJrue Holiday  . PPG   FGGeorge Hill  . PPG   FGI tried to pick guys Rose played the most andor played equally before amp after injuries.  But overall the guys that statically go toe to toe with Rose are elite PGs like Westbrook or CP.  ,chicagobulls,d1d05eo,16,t5_2s3uz

Snells work ethic had me believing hed be a rotation player by year  or  under Thibs and that a total shift in philosophy and less accountability under Hoiberg may have undid whatever Snell was working towards.I always think of what Kawhi Leonards agent said something along the lines of Kawhi being blessed that he was drafted to the Spurs because he might not be the same player we see today if in another environment. Like if stuck in a poisonous environment like Sac or Philly maybe his ceiling becomes a Jae Crowder or Ariza.And then there was Kawhi in the arms of Popovich thanking him for continuing to push him showing that even he needed a lot  of guidance and help to stay focused.Not saying Snell would ever be Kawhi but thought he would at least be a Danny Green to Butlers Kawhi.,chicagobulls,d1nxc23,1,t5_2s3uz

The authors solution is to bring in a team full of headcases.  This team needs defensive players that can grab boards and shooters.

7143019,0,t1_d1q2bwl,Exactly.  Good luck running your offense through the towers inside when the guards cant get it up and in their hands.  Jordan and Pip would still smother the ball handlers.Plus Kerr went to play with those  Spurs.  Getting the band back together involves keeping Phil Pip MJ amp key reserves like Steve.  Not as flashy to remember Kerr as it is to remember Kukoc who would almost average  PPG the following season or coach Jackson but Kerr wouldve taken something away from SAS amp kept it in CHI.

I challenge you to name one important player that hasnt missed multiple games due to injury this year.  Dunleavy missed half the season Rose wasnt himself until recently and surprise surprise hes injured again Jimmy has had tons of health issues this season and still does Pau already said he wont be fully healthy the rest of the season Noah is out Taj is out.  Youre delusional if you want to blame this season on coaching.  Coaches are not nearly as important in the NBA as you all like to act like they are.  As if wed be gunning to beat Lebron if we still had Thibs or something...yea fuckin right.  Scapegoating is not the answer to our problems.  The players should be able to win games with no coach at all they are professional basketball players yall do know what that means right?  Look at what the warriors did without Steve Kerr this season.  A great coach can make a good team better but no coach can stop a train wreck from occurring when the wheels were already falling off.

Something I think has been one of our biggest issues and communication must be even more pivotal to Freds style of play.Nailed it on the head.  Their chemistry is vital to our success as their our two best players and it was obvious from watching this season that the chemistry isnt there yet.  Weve seen glimpses here and there.Communication is vital as well especially on defense.  Fred has talked about wanting them to make their decisions and giving them that freedom.  Its on them to communicate on their switches and assignments.  Coaching staff tried to help by having Boylen taking on the Thibs role and trying to give them orders but they ultimately need to do these things on their own.,chicagobulls,d1sl0td,2,t5_2s3uz

7244819,0,t1_d21e48g,SmdhSo your response is to come back with the Red Herring tactic to give the illusion that you responded to my points?OK Ill get you back on the right track..  Regardless of the average minutes Jordan and Pippen played under Phil Jackson in the course of their careers it doesnt erase the FACT that...      Jordan and Pippen REGULARLY Sat entire quarters eapecially th quarteesof games that were clearly decided one way or another.      STEVE KERR was a member of these Bulls teams..  Phil Jackson or any other NBA Head Coach in the history of the NBA......EXCEPT TOM THIBODEAU...      Was STUPID ENOUGH to leave starters in the game in the FOURTH QUARTER of a PLAYOFF GAME where their team is LEADING BY FOURTY POINTS!.  You asked......Are you saying beating a playoff opponent by  points makes him a bad coach?      Which is a classical RED HERRING tactic.ResponseLeaving starters on the court in the FOURTH QUARTER of a FOURTY POINT BLOWOUT......not only is indicative of a HORRIBLE HEAD COACH......but also SCREEMS of an IDIOT who quite possibly suffers from OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER..  Now since youve decided to travel down memory lane and bring up Tom Thibodeaus Houston Rockets days......How smart was it for Thibodeau to PUT YAO MING THROUGH FULL WORKOUTS PRIOR TO GAMES?????Do I need to enlighten you that...      YAO MING was playing YEAR ROUND in the NBA and in CHINA helping to spread the NBA to the worlds largest market?      Big men need rest due to the fact they are susceptible to injuries to the lower extremities  because of their weight?Yet Tom Excessive COMPULSIVE Thibodeau thought it was a good idea to run YAO MING into the ground......and Jeff Van Gundy allowed it.Predictably YAO MING developed foot problems which ended his promising career  much too soon..  The fact that this is your idea of a Good Head Coach says a lot about your judgement..  Finally Im pleased that you attempted to justify your weak argument with a Red Herring laced with Strawman arguments.This way a reader or two will become exposed to these timeless tactics and after taking a class or two learn how to recognize them and disregard anyone who attempts away people with the tactic.Now...Yawn!Ive grown tired of your tired argument.Thanks again for providing an opportunity to educate a reader or two.,chicagobulls,d21ommo,1,t5_2s3uz

Look at how Drose was when he was the best player on the team. You didnt seem him try to force himself into a leadership role just because he was MVP and guess what?? We were one the best teams in the eastern conference. The point Im trying to make is that you have to earn your way into that role.

7692261,0,t1_d3ghzmp,Exactly. The Bulls are not in a position to demand any value in return for Roses contract. PG is one of the deepest positions in the league and I highly doubt someone will approach the Bulls asking for Rose and if its the other way around an opposing GM will probably ask for a draft pick and the Bulls taking on a flock of bad contracts in exchange for Roses deal.I think the best choice would be to wait and see how this season plays out for him. If he turns things around and plays at a high level you resign him if he fails to show consistency or gets hurt you just let him walk and this is coming from a big DRose homer.,chicagobulls,d3gk74a,4,t5_2s3uz
7694892,0,t1_d3gs5kg,I definitely think that we should have made the playoffs this season. On paper to me were a  seed. But I dont think we can exactly crucify a rookie coach with Thibs roster for underachieving just yet. Im confident in Hoiberg going to next season. Our young guys have another year under their belts and I think this is the first full season of Rose well get since the injury. This year could have been the year but the orbital injury happened. Jimmy Butler has another long offseason to train and we know what happened last time he had the offseason. Im very confident in Hoiberg. If we dont resign Pau I think that our big man rotation could be retooled to fit Hoiball. The ideal situation is to have a coach that fits his system to the players but alas we dont. Were going to make the playoffs next season Ill eat a bowl of my dogs food. Thats how confident I am. ,chicagobulls,d3guy84,0,t5_2s3uz

8064125,0,t3_4pndn7,I have a theory on the Rose trade as it doesnt make much sense if you view it through a basketball lens as it doesnt make the team better nor does it help rebuild for the future aside from Grant so it was a really strange deal to figure out until......you realize the Rose trade was all about making Gar Paxs life easier and had very little to do with basketball related reasons.Gar Pax was heading into a year on the hot seat after firing Thibs and missing the playoffs as a direct result of firing the head coach exact same roster won  games last year. Coupled with this the entire year was going to be spent combating headlines surrounding Roses resigning at the end of the year so this saves them that headache.It also got rid of Reggie Rose long time thorn in the side of management who constantly and publicly questioned the moves the GMs were making.  If only there was some recent history showing the Bulls GMs fire people who disagree with them...Further to this it made Gar Paxs job easier in deciding to let Noah and Gasol walk for nothing with the acquisition of Lopez.  Now they can save face which is what this entire offseason is about by claiming they got a decent center on a good contract for years to come when really they ran the hometown hero out of town traded him for spare parts and hope they struck gold in Jerian Grant because they are such geniuses and they loved Jerian Grant last year but he was not available to draft so trading Rose for Jerian Grant is a great move because Gar Pax really really liked Jerian Grant.Gar Pax just traded Rose in order to make their lives easier not to make Chicago great again...,chicagobulls,d4mhfhr,5,t5_2s3uz

8199827,0,t1_d52dcma,No this was exactly their plan you just never know when the opportunity falls in your lap. The Bulls decided to not trade butler unless they got Dunn and a couple pieces to build around. They didnt get that offer so then they made a series of safe smart swaps including moving Rose in an effort to get something in return for him since they felt he was leaving anyway got Lopez as a replacement for Noah. Drafted valentine as a leader and a future ball handler in their position less offense. Picked up Rondo effectively on what they see as a one year deal. Shows the owner is looking to spend not save. All of this was done while maintaining flexibility when something major came up. No matter what it had been Wade willing to move Cousins trade for cheap Westbrook in a desperation move by the thunder the Bulls GMs were intentionally keeping a decent team together and not tanking to take advantage of any situation as it arose. Notice they still have refused to give up any young assets or first round picks when acquiring these older players. Trading dunleavy and Calderon for Wade should be an absolute no brainer for anyone. Ive been saying all summer how smart the GMs have been and this is the culmination of their savvy.

8244323,0,t1_d582adp,You could do that with a few different stars who led their teams to titles though.  Jason Kidd was an old vet with Dirk not near his st Team All NBA former self.  David Robinson at any point of his career was still impactful smart.Bruce Bowen wasnt a baby.  He was  in his prime and had the best PT shooting season of his career.  Manu was  in his athletic prime and would lead Argentina to a gold medal the next summer.  Its not always about having your teammates score  if you have a great defensive team a squad full of smart veterans.  The double Wallace Pistons werent overwhelmed with scoring and star power either Dirks Mavs or Hakeems Rockets Waltons Blazers.  I dont mean to demean anything.  Duncans  season is absurd in how great it was mythic stuff.  I just think the sorriest group of players and GOAT line are stepping into hyperbole a bit.Even Michaels last title was hard fought.  Rodman wasnt even starting anymore Harper was run down and showing age Pippens back debilitated him.  Jordan only had two teammates scoring  or more PPG in the Finals.  Duncan had six three of them in double figures.  That said I dont many modern Finals line as ridiculous as Tims from that Nets series. PPG   RPG  . APG  SPG  . BPGEveryone knows Tim Duncan is on the short list of greatest players ever hes almost universally considered the GOAT at one of basketballs five positions.  From  through  there was a  in  chance that Tim Duncan would finish the year with an NBA title.  Virtually every in that span he was one of the NBAs best two way players as well.  His legacy isnt in doubt in any way so I just dont see the need to dump any exaggerations on his already tremendous accolades.,chicagobulls,d583goa,8,t5_2s3uz

Also those young guys will still get plenty of minutes except maybe Portis Taj and Niko will make it difficult to squeeze in big minutes for him. Im not counting Snell theres not much wondering to do about him he doesnt have much of a future with this team. Valentine and McDermott are our primary backups at the  both will get significant meaningful minutes.

8257714,0,t1_d59pbvw,I guess well have to disagree on the shooting. I dont think we are significantly worse overall and like you said we were bottom  in attempts last year anyways. Doug and Niko and hopefully Valentine but Ill concede that we cant necessarily rely on his shooting translating immediately are going to be our high volume  pt shooters and we still have them. Hinrich Dunleavy and Holiday all only played in around  games for us not a huge void to fill. So we need Valentine to match some of Moores production he wont match his percentage ! but that was also on low volume with  attempts the whole season. What weve added now with Rondo and Wade are two excellent passersplaymakers hell Wade had as many assists per game as Rose last year. I think what will hurt is RoLo not having nearly the range that Pau did at the center position but we have three big men in Niko Felicio and Portis who all have solid jump shots. Also I think RoLo will be at least as good as Noah was last year.

Key quotegtZipser has exactly skillset  which is missing the Bulls . The NBA three should be no problem for him . Chicago had Mike Dunleavy trade to take Dwyane Wade under contract can . Therefore is there a way for Zipser . With Doug McDermott and Nikola Mirotic of course there are other shooter on the team but in the new NBA you need as much spacing as you can get.gtMaybe I need to relativize something my words Hes still a secondround pick. Many of them do not even make it into the roster let alone in the rotation. He will have to fight but he will get the chance to prove himself. Then there is of course on what he makes of it. However I have heard the Bulls no longer as positive and hopefully talk about a secondround pick as about Paul.TLDR Because they traded Dunleavy Zipser will have a real chance to play and the Bulls are as excited about him as they have ever been about a secondround pick.

9950090,0,t1_db4d67o,I shouldve chosen Allstar instead of superstar. I agree with you if a decent allstar is on the block then Im all for it but it has to be someone decent. Technically Jeff Teague was an AllStar two years ago but I would never trade Doug for Teague. It all depends on the trade and what is on the table. Every trade is different and you have to evaluate them differently. Lets say for example there was a trade involving LaMarcus Aldridge for example. I would be all for an AllStar talent like him but if that trade involves mortgaging our future by packaging Doug with other pieces like Valentine and st round picks then I would be against it. It all depends on who is traded and what the potential package to receive that player.,chicagobulls,db4itim,1,t5_2s3uz

It seems like a given hes leaving either before the deAdline or this offseason I just hope he goes somewhere he will be able to thrive.

When Butler sat down the team was so unprepared Miami almost started another play before we got another player on the court. Obviously you could sit him there. You might even say its likely youd sit him there. But theres a lot of options. Phils favorite move was to wait  to  possessions before doing it. Popovich is a big fan of leaving them out there. Van Gundy as a coach was adamentally opposed to taking guys out for foul trouble who never foul out.

11141858,0,t3_5z2j80,Someone I thought wiser than me once taught me regret is a wasted emotion.  I collected their thought and held it close to home because I knew it was a lesson I needed and still have a hard time putting into practice.  I often shoot myself in my own foot and get down on myself  I cant imagine what these guys on the court must feel when their shot that goes in  of the time in practice is blown shy by a cold breeze.  Who knows why?  Sometimes it must feel like the sky is falling in these moments. The wincing fan is the insult to the injury as the ball lands in the opponents hands. Perhaps we are a sensitive generation?  Is that something to be ashamed of?  If theres one thing this world could use more of its a heart that feels and isnt ashamed to admit that a fan telling them theyre garbage and they ruined their day because they didnt win a basketball game for them actually hurts.   You can ignore the words and avert your eyes but the feeling  or thought  remains.I think a lot of us struggle in silence and cheering and watching others succeed is something powerful for both the fan and the player.  Its a special relationship but its not without inherent abuse or a lack of respect.  Its a disheartening and contagious culture when it goes sour.  I think weve all had days when we take out our problems on others and then later think about it and wish wed said or did something to enhance another persons day instead of bringing them down.  I wish being sorry was enough  I know it isnt  as Butler says Just got to be better.  What else can you do?  Sometimes as a fan I almost feel like Im not doing something right or Im not representing them right and thats hard because it was never about the ego or any of that before. It was about overcoming personal obstacles and embracing a new passion and sport.  Maybe its not easy to capture that proverbial fairy in a bottle?  Love and faith cannot be manufactured tamed or sold.  The real stuff is worth more than all the jewels and kingdoms in the world.In the end I think its important to try to grow from ones life experiences but to look behind you and kick yourself?  Nah.  Just like as a fan or a fellow human being Im not going to come to a public forum and tell these guys how much they suck or how much of a disappointment they might be.  Ive shared in way too many good little memories and theyve motivate me along with others to go farther and play harder and be a better person.,chicagobulls,deux2md,2,t5_2s3uz

11388030,0,t1_dfmrnmq,Bostons current team was not built through tanking. The only high draft picks they have on their team right now are Jaylen and Marcus Smart and neither start for them. IT Bradley Johnson Crowder were not gotten through tanking they were either late round draft picks or assets received directly in a trade.   A ish year timeline starting from scratch is pretty realistic. Unless you catch lightning in a bottle like OKC did you gotta spend  years sucking ass just to find the one or two star pieces to build around like PhillyOrlandoMinnesotaPhoenix is doing and then you gotta start actually winning games to attract top tier free agents lest you jump the gun early and sign Reggie Jackson for  million like the Pistons then you gotta actually start contending. To expect this entire process to take less than  years is mighty optimistic. It requires a lot of patience. And thats not even counting the scenarios where your team build through tanking peters out around the middle like Charlotte has seemingly done with Kemba or the Baby Bulls did before they lucked into Rose or where your first iteration of tanking doesnt work out LoveRubio so you got to start all over again. It is what is it. Gambles dont usually work out in the short to medium term but your odds get better in the long term. ,chicagobulls,dfmtbnx,7,t5_2s3uz

11654512,0,t3_66agtk,Rondo has been a revelation. He was terrible in the regular season. Towards the end of the season he started to come alive offensively but defensively he has been lazy. Now that Playoff Rondo is activated these two games and hopefully rest of the series have made up for a lifeless and boring regular season. This match up with the Celtics is beautiful. Rondo is just toying with the Celtics offense reading plays before they even happen. This article by Kevin O Connor sums it up. To see this Bulls teams so completely own another team is so satisfying. I dont want to think about what this means for how we view GarPaxs decisions so far. I dont want to think about whether we should resign Rondo or Wade. I dont want to think about the draft. I dont want to decide what this series say about Freds coaching ability.  The most consistent thing about the Bulls is their extreme inconsistency best shown by their record against below . teams and above . teams. I dont want to jump to conclusions or discount our current play. All I want is to enjoy the methodical dismantling of the Celtics offense and relentless offensive rebounding and general good play from our younger players. ,chicagobulls,dgh1xnp,14,t5_2s3uz
11655011,0,t3_66aaix,I hope that this version of Rondo is here to stay he has definitely behaved better in Chicago although not without incident than he did in Dallas. I give him a lot of credit for not writing the team off and working through his pseudobanishment. I hope that hes turned the corner and I know his willingness to push back against Butler has helped Butler as well. Lets see how they hold together in the playoffs before we get too high on him though. Hes a major reason that we squeaked into the playoffs and I mean that in the sense that he helped us get in but also contributed to the teams turmoil throughout the year.PS I like how you suggest Rondella for a girl instead of Rhonda.,chicagobulls,dgh3yyd,1,t5_2s3uz

11713944,0,t3_674xtb,Four FactorsStat|Bulls|Celtics|||eFG||Turnovers||ORB|.|.FTFGA||Thoughts. The Bulls are struggling a ton without Rondo leading the offense. Grant got the start for the second straight game but was quickly sent to the bench after missing three shots quickly and almost turning it over on a sloppy pass to Jimmy Butler. MCW came in and in my opinion hasnt had as much of a negative impact but still isnt playing well. Canaan checking in towards the end of the quarter and didnt accomplish much. Interesting that Valentine has not checked in yet.. Mirotic continues to struggle.  Mirotic has been having a rough series and his woes continued after missing a couple shots early. He seems to have lost confidence in his shot. Needs to settle down.. The Celtics are one of the better PT shooting teams in the league and the Bulls arent acknowledging this. Celtics went  in the first period on threes but many of them were open off of driveandkick opportunities. Defense needs to be better at shutting down the PT attempts.. The shots just arent falling. Sometimes theres a deeper reason and sometimes the shots just dont go. The offense has been meh but overall we just need to be hitting our shots. Im confident there will be a run at some point in the Q and well be back in this game.,chicagobulls,dgnszf1,5,t5_2s3uz
