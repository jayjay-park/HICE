And collectors are the sorts of people who are willing to pay a lot for things.And a quote from RaxshiHi everybody. I think I can help answer this question as I am the owner of three Noh Mercy unusuals  and have pricing knowledge on them.There are a couple reasons for their prices being so high much higher than other hatsmiscs. The primary reason is supplydemand the demand for Noh Mercies is extremely high because theyre easily one of the best misc items and theyre very limited in quantity. The other reason is that the people that do have them are either outoftrading not interested in trading them or are putting them up for buyout prices and no less.

914172,0,t3_24l6v5,gtRule  You must set prices for each and every item that you are buying or selling. This isnt the best place for open offers rtftrade is ideal when you know what you will accept. One way to satisfy the rule is to add an example trade basically what youd pay if offered X hat w Y effect. Since you arent offering a set amount for a specific unusual your post is still considered as asking for offers which we dont allow by itself. Adding the example would meet the requirement and give potential sellers a better idea about what you intend to pay. You could say Buyout lta specific reasonable unusualgt but also taking offers if you wanted.,tf2trade,ch8743a,1,t5_2s0s4

Its not like youre going from Hot Rod HypnoBeams to Team Shine Fire Horns in this case you are sidegrading both sheen and killstreaker so it isnt a major win. So Id recommend taking whichever one you like best. Personally I like Incinerator so Id take that.

If you try to use this as a selling point youre going to get laughed at IMHO. If you cant look at a hat and say wow thats really fitting its not a theme. The whole problem is that people saw what happened with the nd generation effects as we had them for so long. They started off high a stormy TC was  and very quickly dropped to mehness as there were  of every effect on every hat. Same with halloween  when we first got moon and eerie and lantern  everyone went crazy. As soon as the second and third lot arrived they very quickly lost interest.As such few people wanted to buy into the rd gens which are going the same way.

Your title must appear like this H Item or items you have W Item or items wantedThe full details of the trade are not required to be in the title but if not they must be in the description. However you must say what you are willing to accept as an offer in your title. For example H Sandman W Offers is inappropriate. However H Sandman W Offers in MetalKeysPromos is acceptable as long as a specific price is listed in the trade description.If you are selling more than  items you can instead use the Store tag. Note that all relevant trade info still needs to be within the post without requiring the user to view an external site. Simply linking to a pricing spreadsheet site or a different trade site to sell your items is not sufficient by itself to meet the pricing rule.Other types of appropriate titles.
