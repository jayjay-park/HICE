2271028,0,t1_clrzlu7,I put my iron to highest heat let it warm up and vary the pressure used on the beads. Sometimes its really high pressure sometimes I dont even let the iron put its full weight on them. Sometimes I let the iron sit in one spot to soften the beads. Watch how they look through the parchment and spend time where its needed.  Keeping the iron moving in circular motions seems to help a lot and Im not against putting pressure on a single bead to get it hot enough to push it around.Hope that helps!

2916577,0,t1_cnzcdp5,I would say dont go into it just buying as many colors as you have enough money for. Bead Surge is probably the best friend you can have. it will take an image and basically show you how to make it in perler beads. What color to use where every bead goes and how many of each bead you need. Id recommend downloading beadsurge throwing any project you want to do in there reading what its color recommendations are then purchasing what you need accordingly.But to answer your question its sort of hard to say.

3826617,0,t3_348vci,I am the author of that page....I recently added the options to removeselect specific colors. If you are getting bad color results and you have a limited color set by all means remove the Sand and Pink colors from the designer and you should get a usable result. To specifically answer your question of why it returns odd colors it is because it is just guessing based off the RGB values of each pixel. It looks for the perler bead that has the least difference in the those values and those are not always the same choices that a human eye would make.  I have played around with various ways to fix this but I find that when I improve the page for one kind of images it gets worse for others. So I have left it asis but I am always open to suggestions for improvements.

5489489,0,t1_cwdaoth,Im pretty sure its impossible to completely flatiron both sides. Once you close the holes in one side if you try to iron the other side then the air has nowhere to escape. It becomes trapped between the flattened side and the parchment paper and just kind of distorts the plastic. At least thats what Ive experienced.,beadsprites,cwdc00i,3,t5_2s9nt
5585851,0,t1_cwp2e3r,Basically you add the clear beads all around the edges like thisOnce your design is ironed you cut off those clear beads using an exacto knife. This will give the sprites nice sharp edges. ,beadsprites,cwph6e2,2,t5_2s9nt

8112805,0,t1_d4rtimv,Thats unfortunate. I hate when that happens. I would look into the tape method for your next piece. It takes a bit more time but in the end I think its a better way to iron larger pieces. Also make sure you poke holes in the tape for each bead otherwise you will have blowouts when ironing. Hot air gets trapped in the bead and expands the centers out real big instead of melting small.Edit Link is a tutorial on the masking tape method although she didnt poke the holes.,beadsprites,d4ryatn,3,t5_2s9nt
