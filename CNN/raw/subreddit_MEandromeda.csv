10562253,0,t1_dd1ygbo,The PS controller has a poor battery life and a giant bright led that I never asked for.I consider the Xbox controller to be better because not only does it have superior battery life but it also has versatility of allowing for a plug and play kit rechargeable batteries or normal batteries.  Also I dont see a light from the controller reflected in the tv screen.,MEandromeda,dd5cmyy,1,t5_38p2j

Games nowadays are about humanizing characters and a game about enslaving people would essentially have to be about dehumanizing said slaves and I just do not see the appeal. In short a game about enslaving people would be as tasteless as a game that allows you to kill children or rape people.,MEandromeda,de1aoi1,2,t5_38p2j

11230344,0,t1_df4qfaq,You call it a bullshit article when the other source being Kotaku did actually zero looking into any of the claims and takes simply the pr release as all thats needed and the final say. Seems to me one site did actual journalism one blogged about something they didnt like.I never said she deserved the hate. Again she claimed to be lead animator. Either shes lying and therefore I could care less about the hate she gets or she actually held a role on the game and shouldnt have been hired due to her horrible resume.They also didnt say she was not lead animator. Recently a former EA employee was misidentified as a lead member of Mass Effect Andromeda development team These reports are false. So she was an employee and instead of outright saying she wasnt lead animator they beat around the bush and say she wasnt a lead member. How they word things matters and is telling of the position they are taking.,MEandromeda,df4y0ji,3,t5_38p2j
11250608,0,t1_df78awy,I guess that makes sense. I sure plan to have one of each Ryder maybe more depending on how far I can branch them out.Guess I just wasnt used to it being less of a part of the character.

11484987,0,t1_dfwzsea,Idk I personally think it would be the whole discrimination issue transgender people face. Not many posttransition trans people have as many hangups about their life. They are more worried about getting assaulted blackmailed shot or raped for sharing their transgender status. Ever walked into a restaurant and had someone throw a drink at you? Ever had someone blackmail you by telling you that they would tell your landlord which can kick you out for being trans? Ever go into a job interview and be told that we dont hire transvestites here sic. A lot of trans people dont have parents because they were disowned by them...I think a transgender person would want to take the  year nap to get away from all the discrimination they faced before and live a life without being scared of being killed everyday because everyone around them knows they are trans. Actually a lot of transgender people that I know would agree with you on being open wish they could safely be more open and are fairly annoyed at the angst and selfhatred that is portrayed most popular media. Though this is more of a question of personal safety because if the wrong people know... a trans persons life could be over very quickly. Just to be clear it would be fairly nice if a world as nice as you described existed and really trans people would probably like to be more open just like you described. Though at least in todays world that just is not possible. ,MEandromeda,dfxtl1r,2,t5_38p2j

11525007,0,t3_64gxv1, assumption on  completionI think the dlc for this game is going to be designed specifically to be played after the games ending which would explain why nothing really happens once you hit  i.e. the games not really over yet. I could be wrong but its the only possibility that makes sense to me.But to answer your question no there are no rewards tied to achieving  completion. Also if youre uncertain about playing it again you might want to take a break and let a few more patches and dlc roll out. Im on my third consecutive playthrough with no signs of slowing but Im one of those fanboys whos so enamored that the problems many problems dont really phase me. You might just need some more time between playthroughs.There is a New Game Plus mode but thats got its own barrels of bugs that need to be worked out so again I advise waiting.,MEandromeda,dg2d0y1,3,t5_38p2j
