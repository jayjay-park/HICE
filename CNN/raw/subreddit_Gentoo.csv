If you really must use firefox. and dont feel like waiting for it to become marked stable in portage you could always go to  and search for the latest version available for any package and unmask it manually  If you look at that website you will see that firefox. is in the portage tree it just has not been unmasked yet.,Gentoo,copxw0v,3,t5_2qrnc

7465720,0,t1_d2puvs6,As youre being told by others gummiboot has been merged with systemd. I personally think this is even more unfortunate than udev being merged since gummiboot barely even had anything to do with Linux let alone systemd. But I digress.Gentoo already has a package sysfsudev which builds and installs just the udev part of systemd. I filed a bug a while ago asking whether a similar thing could be done with systemdboot the new name of gummiboot. Since then it looks like floppym has been maintaining just such an ebuild in his overlay So that might be an option if you want to continue basically using gummiboot but not using all of systemd.,Gentoo,d2qt158,2,t5_2qrnc

7997988,0,t1_d4e5dwe,Yes the musl overlay is already active I used the prebuilt stage so it has never been dependent on glibc.My idea right now is to updaterebuild my chroot so that I can remove gcc and use clang as system compiler. It takes a while on my weak computer llvmclang needs to be built twice in a bootstrap to avoid remaining dependence on libgcc and libstdcOther than that I will have to search for and recompile potential packages in the stage that depend on libstdc which will have to be recombiled against libc.For llvmlinux it will indeed be easier to just keep that out of portage.

8883098,0,t3_51torn,Its not gonna be that bad especially if you do schedule regular updates via cronjob its just bit pain when you wanna try out a new software wait  minutes to compile all the dependencies only to find out that its not what you wanted.Day to day operation of well tuned and set upd machine is no problem especially if you have a daily cronjob to do updates.Anyways probably depends on your workload if you like to experiment with new software that you try for a while and then discard if it doesnt suite your needs then that  minutes of compiling dependencies can be a bit of pain.Anyways there are many gentoo users that compile on considerable weaker CPUs. Its all about that time management,Gentoo,d7fmf7v,1,t5_2qrnc
8947589,0,t3_52peu9,gt I found this thread in the official Gentoo forums.I started that thread.  Ive been helping to fix a number of bugs like this one  I am able to do emerge e world with patched ebuilds and get a working system but GCC is definitely not ready for primetime.  I cant speak for the rest of the problems with Gentoo but with regards to GCC The bugs and delays with GCC are not related to any  problems Gentoo may or may not have.  These bugs showed up all over the place.  Gentoo bugtracker is doing a much better job than some other distros. These are not GCC bugs they are upstream bugs.  People may bitch and moan about how GCC broke everything but frankly its a long time coming.  GCC has been relying on C as the default standard dialect for way too long and so have many packages using it.    Also certain liberties that made it easier to accidentally write bad code are no longer legal like allowing for the implicit cast from boolean false to a NULL pointer. The other issue is that code that relied on undefined behavior but worked no longer does.  Thats a matter or poor programming on the part of such dependent projects.  Undefined behavior is undefined.  For more info on such changes you can read Porting to GCC ,Gentoo,d7nd9c7,5,t5_2qrnc

9431209,0,t3_59tcf7,Since moderation is a topic of interest to the sub at large and this is a change Ill go ahead and introduce myself and try to respond to some of your concerns.  All of this is just my own personal perspectiveHi Im rich a Gentoo dev since  and a user long before that I was installing updates over a k modem in the early days after switching over from Mandrake when it was still called that.  Currently Im a member of the Council and a former Trustee and I got involved in the moderation team via PR which Im a light contributor to.I joined the reddit moderation team because I do follow this sub and try to contribute to it where I can and felt I could be helpful.  I agree with uCabelitz that this sub generally is not in need of a great deal of moderation but my understanding is that the previous moderators are less involved with Gentoo these days.At the time I joined I was actually unaware of Ians posts I wasnt religiously following the sub and depending on rating Gentoo posts might not have made it to my front page though most seem to.  I do think it is appropriate for this sub to generally fall under Gentoos code of conductetc and its enforcement.  Again though Ive yet to see much of a need for much visible change there.  The sub does use Gentoos name and logo which does place it under policies regarding the use of these.As far as activity as a mod in the  days Ive been on the job other than the changes in the moderation team itself the only thing that shows up in the log is the removal of one obvious spam post by one of the longstanding mods.  So I think it is fair to say that nothing has really changed.I dont personally intend to remove any of the recent ugenop posts though I think a few of them are a bit borderline on the posting of personal info logs and such.  If people want to discuss the topic of Comrel or whatever that is fine though I would suggest keeping it to one post per major topic.  This is a lowvolume sub in general so it isnt like things are going to get lost anytime soon.As far as Im aware Reddit mods dont have any special powers when it comes to the upvotingdownvoting of posts.  Theyre just ordinary users in that regard so at most  points of that is coming from the mod team as a whole.  I dont think we have any visibility into who is voting for what nor do I think we ought to.  As far as Im aware our ability to moderate basically consists of locking posts removing postscomments and banning individuals and none of that has happened in any of the posts that seem to be the concern.Again all of the above is just my personal opinionetc.  But hello to all especially those who have been around in the sub much longer than I.,Gentoo,d9bgxvk,5,t5_2qrnc
9602258,0,t1_d9wo2dq,What makes you think there is no appeals process? Theyre not public but there are appeals. As far as Im aware none of the Trustees advocate making appeals public either.Having been both a Council member and Trustee I can say that there really isnt that much difference in how the two groups operate. They just have different scopes.Obviously we could change the roles of the two bodies and hold new elections but what makes you think that the Trustees wouldnt just be replaced by the current Council members if the scope of the role expanded?,Gentoo,d9woasy,3,t5_2qrnc
9608034,0,t1_d9x0d6v,Yes I agree that currently and for the past few years Foundation has taken a back seat to most things in Gentoo.  I do not think that should continue though. The expectation that foundation sits back an sites almost nothing is not a good one. Im not sure what to do about reelection though what may be easiest or best may be a vote of confidence out something.I do not agree that one overarching board would be the preferred solution even if we go with that the council would have to be absorbed into the foundation as the foundation is what is on paper.  Personally I think separating the technical from the actual running of Gentoo is a very good setup that we currently have just slight changes need to be made.,Gentoo,d9xdxi8,1,t5_2qrnc

11178869,0,t1_dez307w,uTingPing gave you a very serious and correct answer. But as you dont seem the believe itgtWith a few changes the Xorg server can be modified to use wayland input devices for input and forward either the root window or individual toplevel windows as wayland surfaces. The server still runs the same D driver with the same acceleration code as it does when it runs natively. The main difference is that wayland handles presentation of the windows instead of KMS. xwayland is nothing else than running a specialized xorg server.,Gentoo,dez41vn,9,t5_2qrnc

11764645,0,t1_dgtg7r5,But that sort of is the point. I want a suite but Im happy with not having all these features and those functionalities I want are provided by decoupled and on average much smaller tools.gt syslogng alone clocks in at more than half that!Im using socklog and its .k lines of code with documentation. svlogd is included in runit which is  the size of systemd.Im also not using an NTP client on my desktop I dont need a boot analyser efi stub doesnt require an additional bootloader etcIm pretty sure that Im not even running  of the code of a full systemd suite let alone more. Building single parts of systemd might be an option especially on Gentoo but again why? Now I still have to deal with a huge codebase the problems I have with their attitude probably still end up with much more code running on my system and I still personally dislike the design of systemd etc. I simply like the way the runit suite is designed Im familiar with the code base and even the project wich is so much smaller than systemd carefully decouples its tools and keeps things very simplistic and straight forward. The entire argument for me isnt so much about that systemd doesnt provide some nice features or that I dont understand why some people in some scenarios might prefer systemd but personally I have no reason to install it and I feel like Im avoiding some problems by doing so.,Gentoo,dgtjw2v,6,t5_2qrnc
