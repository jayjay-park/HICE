Our Premier lunch cruise is the best bang for your buck. Amazing lunch buffet with choke types of food and carved roast beef. Its a bit longer too at around  and the last hour you can choose to make leis take a hula class or learn to play a few songs on the ukulele all with instruction. Furthermore we guarantee whale sightings so if you dont see any on your cruise gt chance then you get to come back another day free of charge. Transportation is provided from Waikiki hotels to and from the boat. Check them out. If you end up going on SoH tell them Randall referred you. PM me with any other questions.

507671,0,t3_1zrhny,It is great that you are taking such initiative in your potential teaching position! Depending on where you are from moving to Hawaii  can range from a mild transition to a huge culture shock. Hilo is in my opinion much more relaxed and easygoing compared to Honolulu. With that being said it will still come with its own challenges. Public transportation is not as frequent as in other cities so you may need a vehicle of your own and keep in mind that teachers in this state make very little compared to the cost of living. My sister has been teaching for  years in public schools and has also held parttime jobs on the side whenever she needed money for something extra a trip christmas presents etc. For a lot of students here english is not their first language. Pidgin may sound complicated at first but it is in a lot of ways just lazy english and you will develop an ear for it after a while.  Oh and the trick to pronouncing Hawaiian words pronounce every single letter. Local students can often be lazy inattentive unmotivated and easily aggravated if they do not understand something right away.  Things like patience and perserverence will be good qualities to have as will an open mind to people from various different backgrounds. Also do you have all the requirements for teaching in HI? If I recall there are some standard things teachers here need the Praxis exam being the main one. Though I doubt you would take that unless the job is for certain. Good luck in your endeavor! ,Hawaii,cfxz41l,1,t5_2qi3u

532136,0,t1_cg0ki5e,While I understand the natural tendency of humans to form groups and that in some ways it can be beneficial to the members there is plenty of wrong with identifying with a larger group based on nothing more than ancestry.The primary wrong is that is sets up an usvsthem dynamic which leads to discrimination and conflict. Think racism. Identity group members are taught to hate others based on skin color or different spoken language. Some identity groups feel entitled to privilege based on their ancestors. Other identity groups feel the need to be perpetual victims based on past discrimination.Think of all the wars humans have fought because one identity group disliked another identity group.It is human to identify with others who look like us.

Remember a few years ago when people were fighting to save that land in Ewa Beach from development because it was such ideal farmland like some of the best on the whole island. Yup its houses now. No one cares. This is not the place to be a homesteadersurvivalist type. But when you talk about society falling apart completely youre talking about a permanent separation with the rest of the world which would have even more dire results rather than just food.

Martial law the possibilities of crime organizations or gangs taking over leadership and infrastructure people stealing or building boats and attempting to sail to lower population islands for a better lifemore opportunities.

Essentially foreign vessels are only allowed to dock at ONE US port and that means that . times a vessel from ChinaJapanetc is going to skip past Hawaii and dock in San Diego or Los Angeles. Anything shipped to Hawaii basically has to be shipped to California first then put on a US flagged vessel back to Hawaii. If the act was modified those original ships could stop by a couple Hawaiian ports before hitting up the mainland. Costs would plummet with the renewed competition for imported goods between Asia and mainland US. I dont know that it would change Hawaiis dependence on imports but itd be much easier and cheaper to import and that would probably allow for bigger stores and organizations to keep a larger surplus.,Hawaii,cjkka5q,5,t5_2qi3u

1829550,0,t3_2ffkhw,From Hawaii Business magazine January  Its part of the article since I dont want to signup for it.TROUBLE IN PARADISEParadise Park owner James Wong wants to revitalize his tourist attraction with mechanical dinosaurs but his Manoa neighbors think his plan is strictly for the birds.The first time Paradise Park owner James Wong witnessed the canned roar and swaying rubber necks of mechanical dinosaurs the yearold businessman was not impressed. On a weekend excursion to the Bishop Museum two years ago Wong stood by aloof as three of his grandchildren scurried about alternately frightened and thrilled by the lumbering beasts. The dinosaurs were actually skillful assemblages of spaceage roboticscreations of a company called Dinamation International based in San Juan Capistrano California. The firms dinosaurs had appeared in museum exhibits throughout the world drawing large crowds wherever they were displayed.But for Wong large crowds were a thing of the past. Annual attendance at Paradise Park his combination botanical gardens and birdshow park in Manoa had been declining from a peak of  in  to  in  a period when total visitors to the state grew by  percent. Paradise Park was itself becoming a dinosaur its sedate collection of birds and plants devoid of luster in the eyes of visitors. I guess after  years any attraction will lose its pizzazz says Wong. Besides when I opened the park in  there was only us the Polynesian Cultural Center the Bishop Museum and Sea Life Park. Now youve got Waimea Falls Park Germaines Luau the Atlantis submarine and a bunch of others. The Arizona Memorial wasnt even open then.Paradise Park desperately needed a shot in the arm to avoid its own extinction but Wong could find no new remedy to resuscitate his ailing attraction. Confined by the strict zoologicalbotanical focus stipulated by his original  commercial use permit Wong found his options limited. His most ambitious previous attempts to revive park attendance had been the installation of dancing waters fountains in  and a comedy show using ducks which made its debut in . After seeing the dinosaur exhibit however his imagination began to soar like a pterodactyl. Says Wong The more I thought about it I realized |Hey every kid loves dinosaurs! We can bring the children in and educate them about the past and at the same time get them to see the rest of my park. ,Hawaii,ck9njdb,1,t5_2qi3u

My main concern is that he used his authority as a police officer in furtherance of the crime.  Responding officers did not arrest him did not issue a  hour warning to stay away from her did not do a thorough investigation.  Yet for other MUCH MORE minor incidences we see people being arrested spending several nights in jail having a  hour warning and a full comprehensive police report detailing every minor detail of what they did wrong.  Something is wrong with the fact that no HPD report was filed in this case and it reflects poorly on HPD as a whole.  Youre right that  cops beating their SO is a small number.

Now it might not be as high in compensation as your current location but for Hawaii if you can find a job that pays Kyearly with some kind of medical dental vision and prescription drugs benefits while having just a high school diploma youre a great success as well as lucky.If you have a  yr. bachelors degree that might land you a better job depending on what you studied. A bunch of my friends graduated college with a degree in English andor Literature and are now working as coffee baristas wait staff or entry level retail jobs. Most of that money is going to your rent ranging from month depending on your location on the island various utilities not included such as cable TV and internet various bills credit card mobile phone gasoline automobile unless its paid off or you dont have one and auto insurance... If you have a roommate or a few that would help you save money for a rainy day. Saving money is sometimes hard to do here.Traffic here on Oahu sucks every fucking day. The only time of each day that is great to drive is at  in the early and dark morning when no one is on the damn road...lol. We were number one in the entire United States off and on going back and forth constantly with Los Angeles for having the worst traffic based on the amount of time each person spends in rush hour traffic per year as rated by the US Dept of Transportation. So were either in first second or third place in the entire nation for the worst traffic and probably worst roads too lol. Other than that with all the downsides to living here I love Hawaii. I love the insanely beautiful girls here the beautiful scenery all year long the beaches the cuisine the laidback lifestyle being able to wear slippers daily or as you mainland guys call them flip flops which if you want to blend in with the locals dont call them flip flops as well as shorts not having to worry about winter season or clothes.Springsummer is all sun and breezy fallwinter is usually rainy and tropical. If youre a city slicker type of person youre gonna get tired of Hawaii fast. Within a years time. If youre an outdoorsnature guy youll love it here for a long fuckin time to come. Hiking trails galore. You can see the stars so well at night. Diving and swimming is fun too. Oh the price of milk sucks so bad here. Same goes for breakfast cereal which is why a lot of people ignore dairy and cereal altogether. Our milk literally drop for drop is by far the priciest more expensive than a gallon of gas from the most expensive gas station you could find in America which is also probably Hawaii.If youre of whitecaucasian descent you might have time adjusting to interacting with locals at first but youll get used to it. Certain parts of the island are home to seriously sour and bitter locals who hate anyone that isnt local like them. Youll come to learn which part of the islands to stay away from at which times of the daynight.Other than that idk about anything else which you may need to know. For now...if you have any questions about the tech industry here feel free to PM me and we can discuss things stuff and etc. I can fill you in on where to look if youre having a hard time finding decent wagesemployment in your field.Just remember that with an island comes limited space limited resources limited amount of the good paying jobs limited everything basically. I hope for your sake you dont own a BMWMini Cooper. The dealership here charges an arm and a leg for the most basic services because there arent any rival competitive BMWMiniEuropean mechanics. So they know people have no choice but to pay their ridiculous prices. Here everyone has a Honda Toyota Scion or Lexus as theyre all Japanese and cheap to maintain repair service compared to the previous European cars I mentioned.

2440260,0,t1_cmd27t9,Though the guy in question is kind of a poor poster boy I mean... hes complaining that the rent is too high when he already owns another place that he rents out what what? the rent DOES BE too damn high here.But yeah theres a lot of silly regulation that pushes up those prices.Lots of land zoned agricultural for pretty limited return.Lots of regulations making it difficult to get anything built anywhere at any time. I can almost have sympathy for not wanting a million hirise towers going up in Kakaako but it aint just there.Communities cant relax their own zoning restrictions because its all one government in Honolulu.People complain theyll just put up luxury housing but thats a result of the crazy regulations. Nobodys going to go through the red tape and gladhand the necessary politicians to put up lowincome housing on a thin profit margin you guys. The way to get people to build lowincome housing is to LET them build housing and get the hell out of the way. A lot of housing will go up and some of it will be lowincome.A higher property tax along with a healthy exemption for families living in their own property would help much here. You dont generally speaking want it to be profitable for individuals to buy properties and then rent them out to pay the mortgages.,Hawaii,cmdbl0k,3,t5_2qi3u

Up on the mountain the air is so clear they appear like tiny tiny points of light. On the beach they appear larger and twinkle more because of the moisture in the air.

3324968,0,t3_2y81ws,Uber is a company with no morality.  Uber may present things to you in Hawaii explaining how they are to your benefit but their concern is not you the consumer or their customer.Their concern is gaining foothold and market share at any cost.In NYC theyve taken their billions with a b in investments and they use they to discount rides sometimes to be less than the cost of a yellow cab.If they drive yellow cab out of business then they can charge anything they want.  They also want to follow and actively avoid and then fight any laws that they determine are going to affect their bottom line.In NYC our government doesnt have extra millions in advertising or specials.  And the yellow cab service is a requirement it is one of a few  ways that you are capable of traveling in the city as a resident.  In other localities it laughs at the laws in place requiring permits registration insurance background checks etc.  This has resulted in a number of major incidents with crimes being committed by a trusted driver who it turned out didnt even have their background check.  Theres often different opinions to the mainland in Hawaii because you have your own unique situation much like new york city where you simply cannot own a car most of the time but let me say it do some research before you are thinking that regulation of Uber is a bad idea. Uber will run your buses and regulated cabs out of business if they are allowed and then force you to use them at a higher rate and then because you all need to use them throw up their x or x or x multiplier on your fare.  Theyve gathered an unbelievable amount of investment and UNBELIEVABLY callous and uncaring and unethical leadership and theyre waging a war of attrition against public institutions whose coffers cannot simply be lined by another round of investment...only by the tax payer either at the point of payment in the future or in their checks when regulated industry is forced to be bailed out in the future.,Hawaii,cp79vly,8,t5_2qi3u

Alan wongs is more on the savory side he mostly focuses on you tasting the ingredients. Morimotos is more modern and surprising takes on pan Asian dishes. However blank check for a party I would probably skip staying in Waikiki and rent a mansion down in Kahala or up on north shore. Then have it catered and perhaps even hire a hula troop.

It is extremely impressive how much infrastructure they have for cycling. You can get from one side of the city! And across a bridge in total safety and there are thousands of people commuting daily. For some reason they live in a cold climate but have seemingly infinite patio bars And bike lanes where as we all drive and go into dark enclosed spaces to socialize. If I some how was appointed head of urban planning I would solve a few glaring issues. Firstly the transition from kal highway to waialae. I dont know how exactly to do it but there needs to be a bike lane that goes over the Kahala mall scrum and drops you on waialae. Then there is kalakaua. Its nice that Waikiki has a bike path but it only goes one direction. They need to put a path down it. Going diamond head. Hell I think they should close a whole lane of kalakaua and give it to bikes and pedestrians.

4901350,0,t1_cucch9t,I have a friend of mine that Im sort of guiding through the code camp process but I dont have any intimate knowledge of the insides of any of them.  Hes in the San Francisco area so hes got more options than whats in Hawaii which Im not really that familiar with. The problem with code camps in Hawaii is that even IT jobs dont tend to pay that well in Hawaii.  Theres military  clearance level jobs which Ive done that tend to pay pretty well but the value proposition for most of them tends to be Hey give us a bunch of money well train you for an IT position and then work with you to get hired somewhere.  That value prop is only as effective as the places you can get hired and your resultant income levels once you are hired  that works really well in places like SF DC Austin but not so well in Hawaii.  Of course they might have arrangements that I dont know about so its worth investigating. As for Python I highly recommend the learn python the hard way course which I bought to support the author even though hes famous for being a dick because its such a good book and its available on the internet for free.  FWIW while I cant speak to the Oahu code academy the SF code academy made the short list on the places I was looking at with my friend.  He ultimately went with General Assembly mostly because he went to the info nights for both and a couple of others and just liked the GA environment better but assuming they can actually get you placed somewhere youd enjoy at a pay level you can get by with it definitely seems worthwhile.  Im a big fan of them in general and my wife runs two startups doing similar but less in depth training courses in Maryland for girls and lowincome people to help make their path to IT a little easier but if you enjoy programming and you really have to enjoy programming I think that eventually you can parlay some good experience into a telecommuting job like I have and work from Hawaii with maybe quarterly work trips into California and enjoy silicon valley employment wages in paradise. ,Hawaii,cuccqiy,2,t5_2qi3u

People are already complain in about fields of solar panels being eyesores.Those diesel plants that give us power?  They dont cause health issues?  What about the metric shit ton of tiny particulates that they put out?  We have no renewable that can replace these power plants right now.  Massive geothermal or massive wave farms would be the only way to generate the base load electricity for the grid.Geothermal has issues too.  Having a leak because your power plant lost grid connection is unacceptable.  But lets keep things in perspective.  For example regarding the hydrogen sulfide leaksgtPGV said its staff took readings as high as  parts per billion with handheld monitors at the site and  ppb along the fence line. Its air permit limits the fence line readings at  ppb on an average hourly basis.The gas becomes immediately dangerous to health at  ppb OSHA limits exposure to  ppb.  So the highest readings were more than  times lower than what OSHA considers it safe to work in.Anyone that went to the hospital was either extremely sensitive or more likely having a psychosomatic response you can smell it at around  ppb.The best solution for the islands will be a mix of solutions.  Solar on houses maybe some solar farms.  Wind power where available. Geothermal and wave power for base loads.,Hawaii,cvz92qz,3,t5_2qi3u

5850059,0,t3_3va9ur,First of all the constitution only says that the government cant establish a state religion not that it cant protect religious heritageicons. And I would imagine technically if another religion were to also point out a legitimate claim to the sacredness of a region in Hawaii it would be equally protected  except of course there is only one religion that originated here which is the indigenous religion. Its kind of like accusing JudeoChristians for having certain holy sites in Israelthe Middle East and saying its not fair that Buddhists cant also lay claim to Jerusalem as a holy site. They could if it were at all backed up by their religious textshistoryculture but its not so its kind of irrelevant. Also its worth pointing out that a larger issue does exist in cases where the US tries to exert federal jurisdiction over Hawaii which is that there are some compelling legal arguments that Hawaiis sovereignty status is at the very least up for debate. This is the underlying current that manifests in current debates such as those surrounding Mauna Kea  because many people feel that the US is occupying Hawaii illegally they are using cases such as these as a proxy to justify that the US is unfairly exerting colonial power to suppress the rights of native Hawaiians and related practitioners in order to consolidate its control of Hawaiis land and people.

Really it comes down to how much longer youre going to be able to spend quality time together. Google says  but how much longer before something happens again? How much pain will either this or the next one cause her?My personal opinion I think you might be better off with a grand going away gesture for both you and your family and ending her suffering.

It seems that European Imperialism wanted every piece of land in the world back then. Long before like the USA who soon began to realize that Pearl Harbor was a strategic point of interest which the US Navy. Then you wonder why the USA conspired to overthrow the Hawaiian Kingdom? No way was the USA going to let a foreign power gain control of Hawaii and Pearl harbor. Way to strategic in the pacific and still is today.Did you know that Britain has a small parcel of land at Captain Cook Monument on Big Island and is granted owned property.

6590584,0,t1_d008v7d,No one would dispute that it is best to spend an extended period of time on a different single island every year and really soak it in. Unfortunately the realities of limited vacation time and money mean that not everyone can come to Hawaii once a year as you suggest. Those of us who are lucky enough may only make it out there once or twice in our lives. Tickets from the Northeast cost  and its at least a hr journey not to mention the high cost of accommodations once youre there.    Its very shortsighted to call it irrelevant...a waste of time to travel between islands on a single trip because each island is different and it may be the only chance a person gets to see Haleakala or Waimea Canyon or the North Shore etc at least for a very long time. That is what youre gaining.

Were going to have to just agree to disagree on whether or not Blaines support for annexation was a wink and a nod to Well send troops but in the end it was US troops that provided the threat of force for the overthrow to occur.  All the parties involved agreed that without them the overthrow could not have occurred.Your use of Alexander as proof that Kamehameha III REALLY REALY WANTED American annexation is sketchy at best.  Alexander was a mission kid writing largely to justify the overthrow and annexation.  see also this Neither Kamehameha III or the Americans were terribly serious about it but if offered the US was going to look into it and Kamehameha III was concerned about the filibuster rumors and was looking for a way to quiet them down the prospect of an official US annexation would do the trick. ,Hawaii,d04aiv7,1,t5_2qi3u

9587631,0,t1_d9uo4a2,Back in the day the permitted sign window was  days before the election and  days after.  However Act    removed this limitation.  The Act statesgt The legislature finds that political speech including the posting of signs in support of a candidate or issue is a unique and important manner in which our citizens can participate in the democratic process. In Hawaii however a citizens right to post political signs is restricted by law to a fiftyfive day period surrounding an election. The legislature is concerned that this short time frame may not give our residents ample time to make their viewpoints known and thus limits their ability to participate in the electoral process.gt The legislature further finds that the restrictive time frame for posting political signs may violate our residents right to freedom of speech and expression contained both in the state and federal constitutions. Federal court decisions from other jurisdictions make clear that political speech enjoys the highest form of protection under the federal constitution. Moreover the state attorney general has issued a formal opinion that the provision of the Hawaii Revised Statutes that places durational limits on the posting of political signs is unconstitutional Attorney General Opinion Letter   The legislature believes that the right of our citizens to post political signs and to participate in the democratic process should not be restricted to merely fortyfive days prior to and ten days following an election.TLDR  So long as the sign is properly placed there is no time restriction on when it can be put up or must be taken down.

10233346,0,t3_5mhzgr,Extended warranty on a  year old car? Are you insane? It will cost more that the car is worth per year several times over. DO NOT repeat DO NOT get a warranty of any type on that car. Most places you even ask will probably actually laugh at you.However that doesnt mean the car is toast. It just is what it is a  year old car that runs and drives. If you cant afford to buy something better it might be worth limping along for a few more years.  My  Toyota land cruiser is still in great shape so good cars that age do exist. But you have to get your expectations in order. If you want that thing to run and drive like new it will probably cost you k when its probably worth  maybe less. My advice run it into the dirt. Change the oil check the air filter maybe fix a few minor things but dont put much money into it. You wont get it back. You will probably be that cars last owner unless you give it away. Its not desirable its not classic its not new and if its smoking bad its not in good shape.
