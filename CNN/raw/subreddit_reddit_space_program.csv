65145,0,t1_celtrhv,Indeed.  If I use the same basic design on another mission Im pretty sure I could use it to help get a crew back from a manned landing.,reddit_space_program,celuhp6,2,t5_2vs3o
83551,0,t3_1v1l6e,Well done nice design! Were waiting to hear back from uThePiachu.One thing that wasnt clearly spelled out but I have a feeling was intended was that the mission be unmanned. He might have wanted to have a first manned Mun landing event... Thats not your fault though and it looks too late to put this genie back in the bottle. ,reddit_space_program,cenxvr3,2,t5_2vs3o
107443,0,t3_1vaxw9,Sharp looking station! Save approved! bonus points for the ad copy lol Impressive lift too that was a significant amount of weight!RSP Mod notegt As long as you dont run into them faster than  meters per second there should not be an issue.We agree with this statement. Please dont run into our space stations at  ms ,reddit_space_program,ceqnwxx,3,t5_2vs3o

229090,0,t3_1wpcqr,Love what you did with this write up.  Poor Bob Bill and Gillin ROFL. I think Rayfrids Duna Gas and Go is missing from the Major Stations and Bases listDuna Orbit Fuel  Oxidizer  Monoprop  Battery ,reddit_space_program,cf4hrdw,2,t5_2vs3o
473329,0,t1_cfu2fmt,Large plane has a lot of junior docking ports near its landing gear small planes have the ports in front of them docking can be tricky but it works.,reddit_space_program,cfu2j7v,1,t5_2vs3o

500234,0,t3_1zs4vk,Ill do the RSP mission though I have some concerns about the specifications of the ship. Namely a trip to or from the Jool system is likely to heavily deplete Brotoros fuel reserves.,reddit_space_program,cfx4p14,1,t5_2vs3o

846300,0,t1_ch0h6l1,OK dont hesitate to ask questions there are a few big mods in there that arent exactly as easy as MechJeb. ,reddit_space_program,ch0h8d1,1,t5_2vs3o
911767,0,t1_ch7vk6q,I had the same idea for that highly eliptical orbit! Project Telephone Pole will use two High Eliptic Relay Orbiter satellites in something like a  x  km polar orbit with a matching pair orbiting Jool. I just need to experiment to see if I can keep them within the cones of planetfocused dishes. The Jool HEROs will relay down to one member of a threesatellite ring around each moon.The highly eliptical highly inclined orbit helps move it through Kerbins shadow faster too reducing the amount of battery I need onboard.,reddit_space_program,ch7x9qb,1,t5_2vs3o
941725,0,t1_chbaviu,FAILURE IS ALWAYS AN OPTION!Not a goal but an option. What we care most about here is having fun. Sure we want to build cool things and have a working space program but if things go poorly you document what went wrong well and you gave it an honest shot... RSP mods have NO issue with the occasional failed mission! ,reddit_space_program,chbbwcr,1,t5_2vs3o
1041947,0,t1_chmkzv4,If you have mission ideas feel free to message the mods with modmail or usfrazer directly he makes the RMP missions. We have another set coming up soon!,reddit_space_program,chmq2jb,1,t5_2vs3o
