5666242,0,t3_3so0qm,In the US Public schools are funded by a combination of property taxes and state and federal sources. Its strongly implied that Lawndale is in California who has some extremely peculiar laws around property taxes.   Plus I think nearly every public school is constantly scrambling for money.  Plus theres the running jokes about where the money is actually going new football goalposts bulletproof skylights   etc.  I doubt Ms. Lee is pocketing the money  she is just trying to climb the ladder of administration and gets annoyed whenever anything gets in her way.,daria,cwzgazp,2,t5_2sgsq
6335426,0,t3_3yy92g,To me its all about the characters and the writing. I feel like each time I watch an episode I fall more in love with Daria and Jane. But my god the writing is just as good as the golden era of The Simpsons except that whole Holiday band episode that was very odd. ,daria,cz9ro2z,1,t5_2sgsq

11111341,0,t1_dei0lsi,Quick! What was the episode It Happened One Nut about?Hint Darias boss lectures her for several minutes about how he doesnt want to hire her because nepotism and yet Kevin just walks in the door and is hired immediately. Kevin acts like a dumbass the entire episode while earning the bosss praise while Daria does the job competently yet gets yelled at repeatedly for not smiling. When Jane makes the phone call to Helen at the end the subtext is laid out and played up so that even you can see it.,daria,dergly3,2,t5_2sgsq
