20123,0,t1_cegpuzb,gtIm not sure if Windows requires files to be installed on the SSD with the OSIm not sure what these files are that you are referring to.  The OS is a large collection of files and folders.gtIve got about  gigs of entertainment on my SSDLike music and movie files?  Mps and such?  You should be able to just move these yourself to wherever you want to put them.  Make a folder on your HDD called videos and move all your videos there.  After you safely copy them to the HDD you can delete them from the SSD.If you have  GB of entertainment files on your SSD it sounds like you have a decently sized SSD.  I would focus on just moving your files documents videos pictures music etc. onto the HDD and leave everything else OS installed programs system files etc. on the SSD.  Once you move that  GB of entertainment files you should have plenty of room left on the SSD for those kinds of things.The only type of program you may want to install to the HDD instead would be if you have several large games to install.  In that case when installing those games you should have to option to specify where to install them.

Normally a sudden power cut followed by it being completely unresponsive to turning it back on assuming of course its indeed nothing environmental indicates power supply or system board.  If it were any other component something would at least turn on momentarily producing some sort of onscreen error message even.  I normally pop open the case and first visually inspect the motherboard capacitors as if theyve blown they will have puffed tops.  If everything looks normal my next step is to swap out the power supply for my tester supply to see if the PC boots with that one.  If it does you know its the PSU if it doesnt youre looking at likely a blown system board.If you dont have a spare PSU laying around you can always bring the tower on down to your local PC repair shop and very directly say you just want the problem assessed.

Left it like that while I was contemplating. So I didnt testdont know if it was directly a result of the uninstall XI thought taking it into a repair shop and asking them to test with one of their control video cards I assume thats a thing? would be the easiest but apparently that costs as much as a new card. Then I checked the cost of leaving my computer on and that was almost as much as too lol. So I just ordered a decent one to test with because the restocking fee was cheap. And I was going to put the money towards upgrading my computer anyways so possibly two birds with one stone? Once it arrived I finally let my comp sleep.

170373,0,t3_1w1c8v,Processor and memory specs arent as important since IP or raw video cameras do most of their heavy lifting on dedicated hardware either on the camera or capture card. A ghz quad and gb memory should be sufficient. If you recording software doesnt work with multicore processors then get a faster dualcore.The biggest two bottlenecks are network bandwidth IP only and disk write speed. You have to figure out the bitrate you want to record at for each camera depending on picture quality and add it all together. The ethernet port on your computer is either Mbps or Gbps depending on what you buy. Its possible to add extra network ports if that isnt enough. Western Digital Black brand hard drives have the fastest write speed excluding the Raptor and SSDs and you can compare the specs to see if it will be enough. If a single drive isnt fast enough you can use multiple drives in a RAID  configuration to increase it further.I usually recommend IP cameras. They have the best priceperformance ratio most configurable easiest to install especially with PoE wiring is cheap and the format is standardized across many software platforms.,techsupport,cexu6wb,2,t5_2qioo

This allows for datamessage confidentiality and message authentication codes for message integrity and as a byproduct message authentication. Several versions of the protocols are in widespread use in applications such as web browsing electronic mail Internet faxing instant messaging and voiceoverIP VoIP An important property in this context is forward secrecy so the short term session key cannot be derived from the long term asymmetric secret key. gtInteresting Datagram Transport Layer Security | Wireless Transport Layer Security | Multiplexed Transport Layer Security | Transport Layer Security Channel ID Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcfmhapy oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeletecfmhapy.

They often use thermal pads and some material resembling cement and too much of it.Id recommend trying to find a disassembly guide online as well as other people that changed the paste themselves.  It can be daunting at first doing this on a laptop but its often quite simple really once you open up the back and visualize the process you saw in the guide.   I had to work on a laptop once that was previously brought into best buy for repair they completely stripped the screws mounting the socketheatsink making my life very difficult.

The most I have used it was for  month straight and it never needed a single reboot. Speeds were consistent and wifi was good.A few users have reported that wifi speeds are not that great but it might just have been their own issues. I did not have any myself but did not really test the wifi out much. It did support  laptops and  phones at the same time but none were heavy users like media consumption.So I cannot say if this router will blow up in a year well nobody can as its not that old but it looks quality for the money.ampnbspThe Asus RTNU is an alternative to the TPLink and it is one of the most liked routers out there for all in one devices router wifi small switch.Like the Archer C the Asus is a router only no modem so if you need an ADSL version there is one of the Asus I forget the name just look online.The TPLink is wireless AC which is the new wifi standard.

590002,0,t3_20w9yj,Short answer Enable VSync.Screen tearing is caused by your GPU rendering more frames than your monitor can display. This causes your GPU to sometimes refresh the frame buffer while the screen draws the frame hence tearing.Why you play SC at hz on a hz screen I dont understand you certainly wont have the APM to notice the input lag but for AC you might actually want to increse the graphics settings until it hits  FPS. Or take the easy way and enable VSync.This has nothing to do with AC being a console port or you having bad hardware besides the screen with the arguably bad response time.,techsupport,cg7c5aw,2,t5_2qioo

598360,0,t3_20zybc,gt All I know about proxies is that they are pieces of software that allow one to somehow browse the Internet anonymously and to view copyrightblocked content.A proxy does not allow you to browse anonymously but can often allow you to view areaspecifically blocked content.  All a proxy does is redirect your traffic through another node location on the internet before going to another website making the website think youre really somewhere else.  This gives a false sense of anonymity as you can simply trace back further to see where your connection is coming from.gt Where do I get a proxy? Are they free? I use the latest update of Firefox for bit Windows  Home Premium if it matters.Many proxy services are free and many like HideMyAss are paid.  Some are browser plugins some are websites you browse to some are applications.gt Once I get it how do I use it? Does it run automatically in the background?I would not suggest using a proxy at all they can considerably slow your connection and the way you use it varies see above for a couple examples of how theyre installed.gt Am I able to stay logged into websites I commonly use?Some sites you commonly use may even end up temporarily blocking you or permanently if someone else that has connected via that proxy server has misbehaved but if connecting to a nonsuspicious proxy thats kinda close by...you can stay logged in sure.gt How do proxies actually work?See above.gt I apologise for my naivet but if someone could answer these I will be very thankful.I would HIGHLY recommend a VPN or VPS if youre concerned about anonymity.  This creates a secure encrypted tunnel between your computer and another machine somewhere else in the world.  Imagine a steel pipe from your house to New York.  From New York it branches into a bunch of clear pipes going to different cool places.  Nothing outside of the pipe between your house and the location in New York can see the stuff inside.  But from that place in New York to the different destinations everything is seen...making it look like the place in New York is going to all these places instead of you sitting comfortably at home.A VPN service I HIGHLY recommend is www.privateinternetaccess.com  They are USbased keep no logs promise anonymity and even take cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin for payment if you like.  Places like torrentfreak PCMag BestVPN and LifeHacker give them rave reviews and Im a user myself.Just so youre aware there is no such thing as TRUE anonymity on the Internet.  If you want total anonymity unplug your computer now and burn it.  Browser addons such as AdBlockPlus HTTPS Everywhere Disconnect NoScript and services like PIA privateinternetaccess can definitely help keep the prying eyes of your ISP hackers ad revenue etc. out of your business though.,techsupport,cg8aci0,48,t5_2qioo

One is that the web site may try to install malware a virus when you visit the site so by visiting a known suspicious site you open yourself to that risk whether you enter real or fake information or even if you dont enter any information at all and just look!  These socalled driveby infections are quite common and require no action on your part other than visiting the site.The other is that someone responsible for your Internet access may notice you have visited the site and assume you have been fooled into entering in personal information and take some action.

They were in direct contact with the heatsink on the reference design but the Kraken G only directly cools the GPU and only blows air directly at the other modules with no  heatsink used.That unfortunately means that they can overheat  in games where the GPU bears the brunt of the load its no problem but in other uses where the RAM are the most used item it is a problem.Check the images in the linked article  the area where the VRMs are is glowing hot compared to stock and most likely yours have overheated.Your graphics card is not dead dead but it is damaged. It could be that the solder has developed stress fractures which means you get loose connections everytime the temperature goes up or it could be something else.Id bet though that underclocking and a better cooler will let your graphics card live a long and productive live.,techsupport,cgh7dbg,2,t5_2qioo

If you are having trouble retaining the knowledge in basic PC managementmaintenance as is what you learn in A I think you should consider something else. IT is not just something you do for a paycheck its part of your lifestyle and part of personal interests. Im not talking about being a big PC gamer I mean you eat sleep breath technology and have a constant drive to learn more. You should have a natural ability to understand the logic behind those electrical pulses racing around the board. You should easily grasp basic idea behind IO devices and IRQs that allow them to work together. Least of all you should have a basic understanding and comprehension of binary and how those little s and s or more specifically off and on and how it translates all the way through your computer to end up displaying what you see on the screen. Im saying basic understanding these are all complex topics that take years to fully understand. But starting out you should at least understand the ground work because if you dont you wont really understand what your learning and it will only get worse the deeper you go. It would be the same as being expected to learn Algebra without having the understanding of the order of operations i.e. addition subtraction multiplication division.

I believe Windows  has a built in backup tool that may work for this purpose.  Take your backups and place them on a hard drive FAR away from all of this.

Clone OS partition Clone Data partition Write OS partition aligned to beginning of disk Write Data partition aligned to end of disk Verify that the bootsector is intact and youre computer can boot Fix the bootsector if it is not working Boot into OS Check that everything is working Reboot to partitioning tools or use Windows if it works and expand the OS partition to fill the gap between the OS and Data partitions.This is a bit involved and will be time consuming.  Look into Clonezilla for a bootable DVDUSB solution or Macrium Reflect Free for a Windows based solution.  Norton Ghost is paid option that is available.The exact steps involved will vary based off the tools you use.  But its OK if you make a mistake since all of your data is backed up and on a hard drive that is not involved in any of this ever.

822922,0,t3_23k314,I wanted to add in for others that think the price of repairs is too high  sometimes they are.  So lets say someone comes to me and wants to install a new OS clean install and also install their applications and move their data into the new installation for them.  There are a few automation tools to do this but to do it right youll be doing quite a bit manually as well.  In a fast machine with an SSD the OS install wont take more than min.  Driver updates and reinstalling applications customers provided software adobe reader flash player all the other little things theyre going to need can take hours depending on the software.  Moving data back is usually quick and simple it all depends on what kinds of software they want to run and what kind of data they need to move. Transferring the contents of users only is easy.  Transferring that plus a database or two becomes much more laborious.  Windows updates will take an hour minimum on Win   hrs. at least on XP . has quite a few less but lets say min..  So far on a modern PC with an SSD there is at least a three hour time investment in this situation.  On most entry level computers with cheap dualcores and a standard hard disk you can easily double this time requirement due to how long the installs updates and especially data transfers will take.At  an hour charging for a full three hours is pushing it when youre dealing with home PCs.  Charging for the six hours it will take on most of the underpoweredcheap machines regular consumers have is not an option as they could pretty much get a new machine for the same price.  Its a balancing act  Im often spending twice the time in labor that Im billing for because otherwise it is not cost effective for someone to have me do the work.  That said Im very thorough and take pride in my work and I highly value customer satisfaction.You will find others who might do the work for hr.  They might do a similar job but probably not.  I can bet you that  times out of  you will not be happy with the results.  Techs with experience that do quality work deserve to be compensated because they are worth it due to the quality of work and the headaches they will save you in the long run.  They also need to know when its not realistic to send someone a  bill for work on a  machine.All that said  doing work for other professionals doctors lawyers brokers etc. that depend on the machine for their business and often need hours and hours of onsite labor you better believe Im charging by the hour in  hour increments and not shorting myself a minute.,techsupport,cgxtgnz,12,t5_2qioo

Pat it dry with a very soft cloth no paper towelsnapkins.  Once the disks are clean and completely dry put one into your console. Try to install the game to the hard drive. Go to my games go to the game you have in the tray and click install. If it installs your optical drive and disk are ok and from now on it will read that game from the hard drive instead of the disk when you put it in.

So maybe your firewall is preventing power dvd from getting new keys.Another possibility is that the discs are for a different region compared to your drive  e.g. the disc is for region B only but your drive is set to region A.Its a bit complicated though as even if a region code is set on a bluray the player will ignore it unless the bluray author adds in some code at the startup of the disc to specifically check the region.

1039492,0,t1_chjpvbr,Wikipedia may be a better source than my explanation but Ill try.In a normal client AP type setup the AP pretends to be the client and uses its own MAC address to talk to the router.  It translates traffic passing through it so that its mostly transparent  the computer thinks its talking directly to the router and the router thinks its talking directly to the computer.  However the translation is limited particularly in that it only works for one device at a time.  Your Edimax claims it can actually do multiple at once but only one per physical ethernet port.In some situations you need more thorough translation particularly if you need to connect multiple devices off a single port or if the dumber translation trickery is otherwise getting in your way  for instance keeping DHCP from passing through.WDS effectively acts as if youd internally connected a network cable between the router and the WDS clients.  This requires more cooperation between the devices but allows the trickery to be lowerlevel.  Instead of the router thinking its talking to your computer directly it knows that its talking to another network device to which you computer is attached.  DHCP works multiple devices can connect you can connect additional networking gear and so on.WDS is a better way to do this sort of thing but its ultimately more complex in the backend and thus can be more fragile so it may be harder to get set up.  Additionally not all consumer routers support WDS whereas any consumer router should be compatible with a client AP.,techsupport,chmg0r3,1,t5_2qioo

Its the most friendly to newbies and the most popular version of Linux Ubuntu is second according to DistroWatch.You have to find out if its a  or  bit machine likely bit to match the Linux version and you want the DVD full ISO version of Linux.Then what you want is a USB thumb drive and this nifty program here it will download the Linux ISO for you so no need to hunt for it just select from the menu. Next you look up your machines BIOS access keys    Compaq  Presario Prolinea Deskpro Systempro Portable    Press F while the cursor in the top right corner of the screen is blinking.    Older Compaq computers may use the F F F or Del key to give access to BIOS.Set the BIOS to first boot to the USB second the DVD drive and third the internal hard drive.You use the arrow keys to navigate.See if you can boot off the USB and if you do your going to format the entire drive no more Windows and install.Make sure your Ethernet is connected to the router for updates etc during the install as you wont have Wifi drivers.Once you boot your going to be missing hardware drivers there should be a icon at the top or bottom for you to get them.Since yours is a older machine the drivers are likely not a problem. Install run your Linux updates that should be obvious on the main screen as well and your done. Tweak Linux to fit the screen and other jazz from the start menu. If you cant boot the installer via USB then burn a DVD of Linux Mint you can locate the ISO the PenDrive Linux software downloaded and use that.The most hardest part about Mint is choosing a desktop so look on the Linux Mint website for the styles of desktop and look at pictures which one you want to install before you install Linux as its going to ask you and youll be lost at that point which one to choose.,techsupport,chxfh2t,2,t5_2qioo

So for example if you look at the TRACERT that I showed above    HOP  is my Apple Airport Extreme Router    HOP  is my Surfboard Cable Modem    HOP   is the Local Comcast office in Fort Collins where I live    HOP  is Comcast Denver office    HOP  is a nd SwitchRouter at Comcast Denver office    HOP  is Comcast backbone in Chicago Illinoisetc..etc... if you read down through the TRACERT.. you can pretty much tell where each HOP is. The MS milliseconds time on each HOP tells you how long that HOP took to respond to your packets. So for example... if youre playing STEAM games and it seems slow .. and you run a TRACERT and  HOPS up you see one of the STEAM Servers is showing ms response time.. then youd know that particular STEAM Server is simply being overwhelmed with traffic. and theres not much you can do about that. gt But yeah I take your point mate. But how much deviation from the mbps is normal or in your opinion acceptable?Could be any amount really. Look at the following examples Lets say you pay for mb down.. but youre downloading something from Microsoft and their Server can only give you mb down. That would be normal given the circumstances.

It depending on your pattern of usage. If you boot up and use the same application often then youll find this operation is greatly improved.However if youre one that runs a lot of different programs over your work session then the drive cant figure out a definitive pattern and so sectors wont be cached as efficiently.

Your graphics hardware is the most important aspect of your gaming performance and short of upgrading that most changes you make will be minimal.That said the best thing you can do is reduce the number of processes running in the background. If you have Windows  or older go to Start and type msconfig then open the Startup tab that appears. In Win  and newer open the Task Manager and go to Advanced the Startup tab. Disable as many things as you can. Ideally all of them. Nothing in the startup section is necessary for the basic functionality of your system and you can safely enable them again later if you wish. After everything is disabled click OK and restart your computer. Then open LoL and reduce your graphical settings andor resolution.

A A charger will probably never need to supply A but it could do so safely for a short time in the event of some unintended event. So a charger with a higher amperage rating than your current one should be fine. But dont get a charger with a lower amperage rating.Its the DC output voltage that you should try to match exactly. Usually a laptop charger will specify something like V AC In V DC Out. Make sure the output voltage matches that of your current charger.There are other factors at work like maybe your charger is a barrel connector with the center hole being positive and the outer part being negative. The lingo is centerpositive and centernegative. You would have to ensure that a replacement charger has the same polarity and barrel form factor of course.You can search for a replacement charger armed with all this information but often times its easier to Google your laptop model and find chargers through the laptop model name.

Something happens during the Completing Installation step that produces this error.I followed the steps listed in the link by TechnologyGenius. It just tells me to Reboot and Select proper Boot device if I dont have anything else connected and moves onto the HDD and reboot loops if I have the HDD connected.

If I do all I need to do is reformat the SD card and reinstall the OS. I have learned an incredible amount about Linux just by using the Pi and there are tons of beginner guides out there for it as it was originally designed for beginners. Just throwing it out there if you have a few extra bucks lying around. Plus if you get bored with it there are tons of things you can set it up for and forget about it  ex RetroPi openElec,techsupport,cjlxndj,1,t5_2qioo

A lower end GPU will limit how hard your CPU has to work because the CPU will be limited by how many FPS the low end GPU can output. Now that you have a x you remove that bottleneck and allow the CPU to run under a higher load as well as outputting even more heat into your case.I HIGHLY recommend you get a proper motherboard the one you have is just terrible.I also recommend reading this article about mosfetsVRMS and this database of AMD VRM setups if you do still do not believe me. ,techsupport,ckaxl6f,1,t5_2qioo

2045491,0,t3_2i85uq,Im guessing that quoted price included the cost of labor in reinstalling windows and data recovery.A few commentsquestions...What is the make and model of the laptop?  Some laptops will have built in diagnostics that you can initiate with a certain keystroke when you power it on.  What exactly does the system do when you press the power button?  If it just stalls out and doesnt get anywhere its possible its the hard drive.   A failingfailed hard drive can often freeze the initial boot process when the motherboard tries to identify the hard drive connected in the motherboards SATA port.  If the drive cant initialize then the system will just hang trying to access the hard drive.  If you want to test if this is the case and no on board diagnostics are available then simply remove the hard drive and observe how the boot process is different.  Are you now getting a prompt on the screen that there isnt a boot device available?  Are you seeing information on the screen during the boot phase that you didnt see when the hard drive was plugged in?  If these things happen only when the hard drive is not plugged in its very possible the hard drive is the culprit.  Its not definitive but without some other equipment to test the drive thats something anyone can do with their system.Is it possible the machine is still under manufacturers warranty? Some of the major retailers will let you check on their websites if you have the serial number available.It sounds like the guy was giving you a price that included data recovery to a new hard drive.  He might be willing to come down in price if you opt to not worry about data recovery.  Of course thats your decision and not doing data recovery obviously means you lose any data that wasnt backed up elsewhere.  It could just be that the drives operating system andor bootloader was corrupted due to drive failure meaning that data recovery might not be difficult.  Either way you should make sure you get your bad drive back from the guy as you might be able to dock it and just drag and drop files.  Note You likely wont be able to drag and drop files from a failed hard drive that stalls the boot process. ,techsupport,ckztsfm,1,t5_2qioo

2235170,0,t1_clnxz2d,ampampamp TCP sequence prediction attack sfw gtgtA TCP sequence prediction attack is an attempt to predict the sequence number used to identify the packets in a TCP connection which can be used to counterfeit packets. gtThe attacker hopes to correctly guess the sequence number to be used by the sending host. If they can do this they will be able to send counterfeit packets to the receiving host which will seem to originate from the sending host even though the counterfeit packets may in fact originate from some third host controlled by the attacker. One possible way for this to occur is for the attacker to listen to the conversation occurring between the trusted hosts and then to issue packets using the same source IP address. By monitoring the traffic before an attack is mounted the malicious host can figure out the correct sequence number. After the IP address and the correct sequence number are known it is basically a race between the attacker and the trusted host to get the correct packet sent. One common way for the attacker to send it first is to launch another attack on the trusted host such as a DenialofService attack. Once the attacker has control over the connection it is able to send counterfeit packets without getting a response. gtIf an attacker can cause delivery of counterfeit packets of this sort he or she may be able to cause various sorts of mischief including the injection into an existing TCP connection of data of the attackers choosing and the premature closure of an existing TCP connection by the injection of counterfeit packets with the RST bit set.gtTheoretically other information such as timing differences or information from lower protocol layers could allow the receiving host to distinguish authentic TCP packets from the sending host and counterfeit TCP packets with the correct sequence number sent by the attacker.gtAnother solution to this type of attack is to configure any router or firewall to not allow packets to come in from an external source but with an internal IP address. Although this does not fix the attack it will prevent the potential attacks from reaching their targets. gtIf such other information is available to the receiving host if the attacker cannot also fake that other information and if the receiving host gathers and uses the information correctly then the receiving host may be fairly immune to TCP sequence prediction attacks. Usually this is not the case so the TCP sequence number is the primary means of protection of TCP traffic against these types of attack.gtInteresting Transmission Control Protocol | Network security | Aircrackng | Session hijacking Parent commenter can toggle NSFWmessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwclnxzim oror deletemessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot DeletionampmessageBdeleteclnxzim.

In general I usually follow something like this   Make a clone of the system as is in case I need to start over.   Strip out existing anti virus. Clearly it didnt make a difference before and its likely been compromisedsabotaged so its only going to get in the way at this point. Note that uninstalling isnt enough. Youll need to download the removal tool from the AVs website to make sure all remnants registry keys etc are gone.    Strip out Flash and Java to eliminate possible reinfection vectors.   Remove any browser extensions and reset browsers to default settings. Try to avoid resetting users saved passwords etc.   Investigate what the malware is doing. Is it just adware? Did it create a hidden partition? Did it modify the boot sector? Does it lock down administrative tools? Tools like TDSSKiller and MBRCheck are valuable here.   Battle time. Do whatever I can to cripple the malware and wrest control back in to my hands. Try to avoid dealing a lethal blow to the operating system but dont worry about deleting or modifying noncritical components. They can be fixed later once Ive regained control of the system.   Once Ive sufficiently disabled the malware install and run MalwareBytes. After its done reboot and run it again to check if the malware is spawning new infections on start up.   If MB comes up clean and the system isnt otherwise acting up move to the next step. Otherwise back to step .   Reinstall whatever anti virus was on before update it and run a scan.   If that scan comes up clean move to the next step. Otherwise back to step .   Repair damage done to Windows if any. Run sfc scannow from the command line and install any pending Windows updates.   Reinstall Flash and Java as necessary with the latest updates. Avoid them if possible.,techsupport,clrd634,1,t5_2qioo

2342784,0,t1_cm19xiw,Downloading torrent files isnt illegal. Its just a file that includes a series of instructions for your bit torrent client to connect to the seeders. Downloading content protected by copyright is illegal. Generally speaking as a good rule to follow if theres any way anyone could have made money from it unless they specifically stated this is free its probably illegal to torrent because its probably copyrighted.That said its hard to police constantly. The amount of torrents being downloaded is much higher than the amount of people able to police said torrents. For example when a new episodes of a TV show is uploaded within the first  hours or so it will get downloaded about  times if it is popular. That number is pretty big and is an absolutely nightmare for copyright enforcement. When torrenting you have you pretty much accept what youre doing is illegal but that its also not as likely to get you caughtfined as people would like you to think. That said when you do get caught youve only got yourself to blame. Private Internet Access offer a great Socks proxy and theyre only like  a year. also I think various countries have different laws on leeching vs. seeding. Say you download a film and then close your client watch the film then delete it. This may be legal in some countries whereas downloading a film and then hosting it on your PC for others as a seeder would be illegal. But again  difficult to enforce in a consistent way.,techsupport,cm1a3f7,10,t5_2qioo

Secondly check to see if your computer has making minidumps systemrootminidump systemrootmemory.dmp If these files exist then you have been getting bluescreens but maybe it was restarting too quickly. There are utulities that can open these dump files and show you what the fault was.You can disable the automatic crash reboot in sysdm.cpl advanced tab startup and recovery and near the bottom uncheck the auto restart option. I like to do this so I know when I am getting a blue screen crash. Heat seems likely but one time in the past it was a memory issue for me. You could run memtest overnight.

2442552,0,t1_cmdkyp0,This stackexchange post is very helpful for understanding USB power supplyrequirement. From what I read there are a few things that support my theory. To start USB only supplies mA of current initially its not until the device has been enumerated basically finished connecting to the computer that your computer will allow up to mA on USB mA on USB.x. So in your case the mA is probably only enough to power up the device and talk to it but not enough to also start spinning a disk.Secondly some motherboards use a buspowered hub for USB meaning that all of your USB connections share the same mA source rather than having an individual source for each port leaving even less total power available for all of the USB devices you might have plugged in. You could test this by unplugging all of your other USB devices and seeing if your optical drive works with a disk in it then.Your drive likely works on your MacBook because MacBook USB ports diverge slightly from USB standards and provide A of current.If Im right a powered USB hub would probably do it for you.

If the battery stats become corrupted its usually extremely difficult to resolve the problem and often results in Jtagging being necessary. The keyboard that the app you downloaded defaulted to had a recursive logic error. Ive heard of this once before it is a mathematical calculation that causes Snapdragon  chips specifically the logical second core to spectacularly fail. It has a lot to do with overheating and pulling voltage from the other cores. On a mobile chipset this is catastrophic. The power delivery circuit has failed. Not gonna lie about this one the phone is a paperweight.

2531016,0,t3_2onjsn,I have never used a inch teleivion hooked up to my computer but I have used several  inch tvs as secondary monitors.  Video looks great when doing so but web pages text and fine detailed stuff like that look very subpar and just something not right about it. As someone else mentioned its like when you put your monitor into a nonnative resolution.  Though the TV will be in its p native resolution it just wont look right on the desktop. You can adjust settings and get it to looking a little better but it will never look as crisp as an actual monitor looks for those things as it is built for video not text.  This is fine for me when I m using it as a secondary monitor primarily for streaming video! I would never want to use a tv as a primary choice though personally unless the machine was specifically built to be a media center intended for video watching.I should point out that is is merely my own experience and it is with much larger televisions.

Sometimes homebrew rips or media conversions can be messed up by the person doing it or not encoded properly for all devicesplayers. Lastly are you trying to stream this across a network? Network errors can cause trouble like this. There are lots of reasons other than bad sectors on a drive that can cause problems like these. Also it could be a problem with your phone and the filesystem in use there and not necessarily your hard drive.

The lease will renew automatically if youre connected to the network at or around the time of expiration. In the event youre not connected at that time the DHCP server will allow that IP to be assigned to another device that connects to the network. Generally the server on the router will assign them sequentially within a specified range IE ... ... ... and so on  So if you were not able to renew your lease and another device connects to the network and your IP is next in line to be handed out it will give your IP to the new device.On small home networks the DHCP lease is immaterial for the most part.,techsupport,cn9qoh0,1,t5_2qioo

I honestly believe at this point the card could be faulty the only other thing that I could think of would be the power supply but Im assuming that you got decent one so it shouldnt be an issue. As far as the core unlocker screen I read somewhere that some older quad core cpus were retrofitted into tri cores and the th core was turned off though software. but to lower costs even more the th core wasnt designed to be used so on some systems you could turn it on and have no problems while on others it would cause system instability and even hardware damage doubtful. Now if your system is one of these you may want to go into the bios and disable it instead of letting the motherboard attempt to use it and fail. This probably wont solve the issue but it wont hurt to try. ,techsupport,cnebfay,2,t5_2qioo

2751630,0,t3_2rjjt5,There is no wrong answer to your question. It really comes down to what you like. I would attempt to get a few certs that would expand your skill set and expose you to different aspects of IT. Personally I feel that the CCNA and Microsoft  and  are a good place to start given what you currently do. You can go about studying for those however you like I like cbtnuggets as it is self paced relatively inexpensive and they have a lot of content. Some people like taking classes but they tend to be expensive and boring.      The CCNA will expose you to networking and you learn A LOT of useful information no matter what your final path may be. Many people like to suggest the Network  cert instead of the CCNA. I feel that the if you are going to study you might as well get the CCNA as it cobers the same networking info as the Net  and it touches on Cisco specific stuff. It also looks waaaay better on a resume.     As for VMs get ESXi on any piece of hardware and get vsphere working make a bunch of stuff and break it. repeat.   Check out rvmware for all the info and help you need to get that going. Personally I have the following CCNA A  and . Currently studying to get OS X certified as there are not many techs with that cert in my area but there are many jobs.

2846831,0,t1_cnrn1g2,That beep typically indicates if your computer was able to POST.  POST stands for Power On Self Test.  This is a test that your computer performs before booting from any of its devices to verify that it has all of the components required for a computer to run and that theyre all functioning properly.  The three components required are the CPU the motherboard and the memory.Since you mentioned that you attempted to run your computer with only the motherboard CPU and memory installed and you did not hear the POST beep one of these components is probably bad.In my opinion the most likely candidate is the memory.  Try booting your computer with the motherboard CPU and only one stick of memory installed at a time.  If the computer POSTs with a single stick of memory that stick of memory is probably good.  If it doesnt then it could indicate that the stick of memory is bad.  If your computer wont POST with any single stick of memory installed it is possible that all of the memory sticks are bad or that the problem lies with the motherboard or CPU.  To completely rule the memory sticks out you will need to either test that memory in a different computer or test known good memory in yours.If you perform the above memory test and verify that your sticks of memory are good then the second most likely candidate would be the motherboard.  If you test known good memory in your computer and it still wont POST the problem has to be with your motherboard or CPU.  In my experience I have seen several motherboards fail but only a few CPUs.  To thoroughly test your motherboard you will need a known good CPU that will fit in the CPU socket on your motherboard and known good memory.  If the computer will not POST with the known good CPU and memory then the problem is with your motherboard.The test for your CPU is similar to the test above.  You will need to test your CPU in a known good motherboard with known good memory.  If the computer POSTs then the CPU is good if it doesnt it is bad.TLDR My recommendation is to test your memory first.  If the problem is with the memory RMA if still under warranty or replace it.  If youve completely ruled the memory out by testing it in a known good computer and everything works then RMA your motherboard.  If you still have problems afterward RMA your CPU.If everything is out of warranty then I would recommend thoroughly testing all components to verify which one is bad and replacing it.,techsupport,cnromyo,1,t5_2qioo

2946121,0,t3_2twepe,I can see evidence of some form of liquid.  That could have damaged the keyboard creating the issue with the keys not working.They likely dont want to clean off a foreign material from the casing or it may be scuffed and therefore they want to replace that as well to bring the entire machine back to factory new condition.Ask if they can simply repair the keyboard and leave the top casing alone.  If they cantwont ask for clarification as to the damage caused to it.Theres a chance they broke some plastic pins or clips and could just be telling you its because of the liquid.Overall I would also recommend checking pricing online to see if you can find a better deal.  Keyboards are almost never hard to replace.  However thats a newish machine so finding parts could be difficult as they usually wont be available on the open market until another one breaks or they go out of warranty.Fifty isnt a bad price for that keyboard... so perhaps they can just ship you the keyboard and return the laptop as is.

She said I was responding too slowly and called my mother to explain the situation. My mother tells her No that response time is normal.  The nurse explained to me how worried she was before she talked to my mother because she thought I hit my head when I passed out. I still got to get the rest of the day off.

3022447,0,t3_2ush09,What kind of email sync do you want.   Does your boss want to view her emails from both gmail and amp on her gmail account  or does she want both account on an email client.   If the former then the easiest thing to do is to forward all her email from amp in the her settings to forward to her gmail email.  If she wants to be able to only keep her amp emails in her gmail account add a pop account under gmail settings.   Pop email mean that the receiving end will download all the incoming emails from the inbox and will by default delete them from the pop server. There should be settings in gmail to keep the emails on the amp server for how many days. If youre planning on using outlook you just need to add the imap account for both amp anf gmail to it.   Imap will sync all your emails but will only download the most current and opened emails. For smtp you are just using the email account either amp or gmails email server to send out emails using that address. Make sure that you have the correct port for the different email server.

There are also longer CDs for audio but some mostly older cd players might have issues with them.The amount of songs is dependent of track lenght. I have a CD which contains  songs Its a novelty cd of bands doing  second songs called Short Music for Short PeopleDisclaimer My preferred method however is hooking up my smartphone or my antique iPod with a cable from the headphone jack in the smartphoneiPos to the AUX port of my stereocar radio and make mixtapes with playlists rather burn cds.

They are allowed to provide conditions if say the phone was subsidized through a contract purchase eg getting a  iPhone for  with a two year contract. FCC site Relevant sectiongtQ When Is My Device Eligible for Unlocking?Once the new standards are fully implemented your postpaid device is eligible to be unlocked after you have fulfilled the applicable service contract completed the device installment plan or paid an early termination fee. Your prepaid device is eligible to be unlocked no later than one year after activation consistent with reasonable time payment or usage requirements.If they continue to refuse or provide you the information about how or when you can be eligible for unlocking than do this. Inform them they are violating Federal law either record or get in writing their refusal then contact your attorney general. More likely than not once you let them know you are aware of the statutes and are willing to file a complaint with either your Attorney General or the FCC which takes less time than arguing with these jackoffs by the way they will most likely fold.SOURCE used to do iPhone and mobile product support and informed customers of this tidbit on a daily basis.,techsupport,cofju17,10,t5_2qioo

A routerap with ddwrt is an option on the cheap using disregarded equipment but takes some setting up.If channel log in to the routeraccess point of your brother and change the channel in use to something with the least interference.These are the top two issues Ive seen. Theres more PS if anything in between your brothers ap and your bedroom generates a magnetic field like atomic box normally minor unless you have  phases. This is why reebar is so crappy for reception since some energy from your WiFi signal is converting into em field by passing through metal which hinders the rest of the signal as well. With the grid setup of reebar its pretty annoying. Stuff like this is normally not that big of a deal in reception since most signal is lost by the walls etc themselves but Ive seen some weird shit....edijust got home from barato mic boc? the fuckelectric bocautorcorrect fuck you,techsupport,cok91dt,1,t5_2qioo

3218240,0,t3_2wznzu,Hm I know for a fact that you can multiboot OS X with WindowsLinux on a mac. You should be fine doing it on a PC only if the specs are compatible with OS X. The only issue with that is that they usually advise installing OS X first because it requires your BIOS set to AHCI mode. If it set to IDE mode right now it might mess with your existing Windows installation once you switch to AHCI. Just make sure that all of your parts are compatible with OS X as it tends to be a very picky beast. If that fails then you can just try OS X out with VirtualBox or something. I used OS X in a VM for awhile until I bought my MacBook and the VM works quite well. ,techsupport,covkm7j,2,t5_2qioo

3236678,0,t1_cowuynm,The KernalDataInPageError is often associated with bad sectors on a disk though your hardware test didnt find anything.What you note about the BSOD that occurred with the memory scan is of particular interest to me. If the memory test had completed and Windows just booted afterward before bluescreening there should have been memtest logs. If the computer is getting a BSOD when running RAM tests then that pretty much eliminates an application or driver as the cause. Another thing you can try doing is a stress test on the processor and RAM and then keep an eye on what happens. Prime is a great stress tester as itll utilize all CPU cores and all your RAM. All it does is run calculations but if putting your CPU and RAM under heavy load will cause it to crash youve significantly narrowed down the possible causes.Another stress test you can run is Barts Stuff Test basically it writes to all the free space on your hard drive erases and starts over until you tell it to stop. Itll also tell you if it has any problems writing to your hard drive.Id suggest giving those two a try separately to see if one or the other will reliably give you a BSOD.,techsupport,coxhlfw,1,t5_2qioo

If yes then the first thing you should do is backup your most important data ASAP then download the manufacturers diagnostic tool or a rd party diagnostic tool if the manufacturer doesnt offer one and test the drive with it to see whats the situation. If its not recognized again you could still try with the bootable Ubuntu to see if it can help you this time if it worked with the other laptop. You could also try another drive with the same SATA cable to see if the same thing happens or at least try this drive with a different SATA cable in order to determine if thats whats causing the problem.Hope that helps.

Then boot from it then run recovery software to recover your data onto an external drive or stick.Stop using your PC until you have recovered everything you can or you will make it harder to recover data.Your HDD will probably need to be replaced as well or RMA it if its under warranty. You can try reformatting it after recovery and seeing if its stable but if the bad sector count keeps rising it definitely needs to be replaced. Id just get a new HDD personally to be safe. Use HDD Sentinel or a manufacturer utility to test it as well. Good Luck!,techsupport,cpkwo1f,1,t5_2qioo

3450556,0,t1_cpksyrz,So i actually PMd the the head of PCpartpicker and he transferred me to this guy and this is what i was told.Hi cookbPhilip forwarded your PM to me about the machine you were having trouble with. Ive got a few suggestionssteps you can take to try and isolate the issue.First thing I would do is strip the build to the bare minimum.  GPU DIMM of memory  storage drive and see if you can boot. If not try the DIMM in a couple other slots and repeat  your motherboard should let you know the ideal place for a single DIMM but Ive had varying luck with that information in the past.If the computer still will not boot swap to the other DIMM of memory and repeat. Assuming the issue continues swap the GPU next. The last troubleshooting step I would take is attempting a BIOS update. You can view the latest version on MSIs website and it should allow a USB boot.If you are still unable to boot after testing both the GPUs and your memory I would contact MSI about a warranty replacement for the motherboard. Id say it is fairly safe to assume your PSU is fine as I noticed you have already replaced it once and you had plenty of headroom with both units.Hope that helps and you can get the machine working!RyanPCPartPickerHope this helps in the spare time of you waiting for your new PSU. ,techsupport,cpll94k,2,t5_2qioo

First off Lets look at your old setup    Wall gt Gateway gt Wired devices                         Wireless Devices  Which since a gateway is a modem and router together is basically    Wall gt Modem gt Router gt Wired devices                                 Wireless DevicesAnd your new network is    Wall gt Modem gt Router gt Router gt Wired devices                                             Wireless Devices  See the redundancy? Youve got two routers now.  That being said it CAN work. My guess is that right now your gateway the verizon box is getting an external IP lets call that ... yes this isnt real bear with me for explanation. It takes that single IP address and splits it to all your devices on an entire network it creates IP addresses are usually ..x.x.  Your router that you just purchased is also taking a single IP address from lets say ... and turning it into its OWN network of ..x.x .I think the problem youre having is that both routers are trying to use the same ..x.x values. If you go in your new router theres somewhere to set the internal range usually in the LAN settings. Itll probably be set to ... or .... Whatever it IS change it to the other. Reboot everything and you should then have internet access I think.  HOWEVER this just gets you internet. You still have a double NAT network and that creates a problem.What you need to do is contact Verizon and tell them you want to turn your Gateway into a Modem. Theyll help you disable the routing and wireless features they may call it Bridge mode which basically means that the single external IP address that verizon assigns you will be BRIDGED over their hardware and passed to your new router. Youll only be able to have ONE THING plugged into the Verizon gateway they may even instruct you an exact port to have it plugged in and all your devices will have to be plugged into your new router.After they get the configuration right youll probably be instructed to reboot everything but then you should see it working as usual.edit  Also make sure it goes    WALL gt GATEWAY gt WAN PORT ON NEW ROUTER gt YOUR DEVICES IN NUMBERED PORTSThe WAN port is the yellow one thats set apart from the others. ,techsupport,cpodptp,5,t5_2qioo

3738237,0,t1_cqi3d1l,Warning incoming lesson.Looking at the Linksys I even found the emulator for it  it looks like there are separate sections for the . and ghz networks I presume they have different SSIDs?SSID Service Set IDentifier is essentially the name of the network you connect to BSSID or Basic SSID is the MAC address where ESSID or Extended SSID is generally a friendly name  One of the many benefits of ESSIDs is that you can have multiple BSSIDs representing an underlying ESSID and have them all seamlessly connect to the same network.  Ill leave it at that.You CAN name both of these the same and your wifi devices should be able to roam fairly seamlessly between them provided they have the same security settings and passphrase.  Roaming in this context is irrelevant since you will be the same distance away from both APs.  Generally Roaming is used when you have multiple APs or Access Points in different geographical areas to enhance coverage.Before I get too far almost every commercial router whether dlink linksys netgear trendnet etc is a combination of three things a router a switch and an access point.  The Switch is what gives you  or more ports on the LAN side on the back of the unit often the switch will have an internal port to connect to the router features this is where ..x. generally resides the AP will also be connected to the switch it effectively provides a bridge between the wireless clients and the LAN which then connects to the internet through the router.The most complicated part is the router  which is actually moving your data to and from the internet and the only physical part of the router you can see is the WAN port which is wired directly to the routing circuitry.okay with that basic of routers out of the way.  Generally wifi on these allinone systems are garbage.  You can determine this yourself by comparing the price of an Access Point of relatively equal capability to a wifi router.  The wifi router is typically cheaper usually by a nontrivial amount.  So understand youre already working with substandard equipment.  Definitely not businessgrade.  Some flaws will be obvious.With that said WiFi is TERRIBLE when it comes to bandwidth reliability and overall capability.  As an example For reasons I wont get into right now There is what is called a basic rate that is used whenever the AP is running in protected mode  this basic rate needs to be able to be spoken by all stations everything connected to it.  If any station cannot maintain a connection of high enough quality to communicate at the basic rate the station is disassociated dropped.Theres precious little that can be done about protected mode operation if the routers AP has kicked into protected mode then youre going to get screwed for many reasons . protected mode requires request to send RTS and clear to send CTS packets to be processed for everything being transmitted which addes  interactions that are otherwise unnecessary at the basic rate which takes up a lot of TIME.  To be clear here time in this context is relevant Im speaking of milliseconds of time but in the wild west of wifi milliseconds can make all the difference especially when you have k packets to transmit and you have to pack in a few ms of delay sendingreceiving RTSCTS for each one.To compound this Wifi signals are subject to interference.  If another wifi network is nearby using a SIMILAR frequency then its encrypted transmissions are viewed by your network as interference.  Your network cannot function with significant interference.  So my first inquiryquestionrequest is to determine how many nearby wifi networks there are contending for the same wifi space inSSIDer can do this theres a free version of this though they recently went pay just google it also the android app wifi analyser does a similar task?Above and beyond there are a number of other wifi interference sources cordless phones are they operating on . ghz? or Ghz? these are cordless phones for your landline  if you have one microwave ovens not much can be done here just look for trends if someone microwaves something does your connection get worse?  might be time to replace the oven with a higher quality one cordless headphones or other cordless devices.the worst is the .Ghz range it seems to be used for almost everything now.  So much traffic going on in the range that its getting difficult to get something across thats legible on the other end.  this is why Ghz was recommended to you first theres much less interference sources on Ghz and its not prone to interference from microwave ovens.  So Ghz is a choice but the smaller wavelength of radio wave can be reflected and refracted by much smaller obstacles.  lower frequency  longer waves.  Waves reflectrefract and are absorbed based on the length of the wave and the size density and electromagnetic properties of the material they are encountering  essentially longer  easier to pass thru more objects smaller frequency ghz  longer wavelength.If theres a lot of materials between you and the router many doorswallsfloorsetc then Ghz might be just as bad as congested . because of refraction and reflection.My next question is that how much materials are between you and the AP?  What are they made of? is it mostly concreterebar or wooddrywall?My next question is Ghz specific What channel is the Ghz operating on?  The reason I ask is that some frequencies namely the ones in the middle are required by FCC regulations to use a variant of FHSS Frequency Hopping spread spectrum  which is a very old standard thats being used specifically to avoid signals on other networks sounds great right? no.  not all stations are good at dealing with FHSS and encountering an active FHSS network can cause the connection to jump around causing multiple disconnects in very short timeframes seconds.  I recommend locking down the Ghz to an unused with no neighboring contenders channel in the Ghz range.  Your wifi application whether inSSIDer or Wifi analyser should be able to tell you whats unused.Im also going to take a second to explain no neighboring contenders  essentially wifi needs width or band width  which literally is a width of bands or frequencies in a range.  Eg it is well known that .g as an example uses a Mhz channel Width  which gives it aprox.  channels on each side of overlap.  This means your network will conflict with any other network in the area of  or   channels  to give an example youre on channel  my AP on channel  causes interference on your network.  Joes network on channel  also interferes with your network but Joes network doesnt interfere with mine.  There are three well known channels considered to be nonoverlapping   and in North America . in other parts of the world  is available and preferred over .  so keep in mind that you not only need your own channel but you need to stay away from other users on other channels as well  things get complicated fast.Hopefully we can understand what your wireless situation is so we can figure out what to do next because with understanding can come the best solution.  Otherwise Im just taking stabs in the dark.,techsupport,cqidstr,2,t5_2qioo

Enabling this and changing the settings in your favor would help with your League playing and keep your ping down but still allow your wife to watch Netflix without issue at the same time.Since you want to start streaming as well youll want to make sure you have a decently high amount of upstream too so you may need to upgrade your package or consider it to provide higher quality as Im unsure what your current speeds are right now too.However if you still really want to buy a new router either way Id highly recommend any of the ASUS RT series routers any of the ones in the  range will do just fine then also what your current wireless devices support. You might not need to go overboard and buy an AC router for a higher price when an N router would do just fine especially if non of your other devices are AC compatible right now too. A dualband router just gives you the option usually simultaneously now a days of running your WiFi connections at both on the .Ghz band and Ghz. Rather it be to lessen interference with other networks devices and so forth.,techsupport,cqk1xh1,2,t5_2qioo

3779381,0,t3_33omun,Hey PickerLeech!I see theyve already explained about Steam. If theres anything additional you need Steams KB is pretty nicely put together. These links may be able to help you about Steam installations  Otherwise having more than one partition on your OS drive is mostly a safety precaution if something is to happen to the OS and for instance it needs to be reinstalled. In that case everything from that partition is erased and replaced with a new copy of the OS so your personal files is good to be safe on a different partition. And as a second benefit its more convenient to store and arrange your personal data. You can install whatever you want on D drive even another OS then you will be dual booting. If you decide to install programs there and not on C most of the files would go onto D but there still will be some system files that need and will install on to the OS partition in order the software to be able to launch.Like iotester said from Disk Management you can do anything to that drives partitions delete format repartition extend or reduce it. Just read carefully what you select so you dont end up with an empty or complicated drive.Hope this helps! CKWD,techsupport,cqn2rpd,1,t5_2qioo

Currently OSX is the only OS that has good display scaling. On Windows older programs may look bad with wrong sizing of display elements.

You have to teach them how to regulate and share the bandwidth they have in order to provide the best service to their users.The way you do this is by establishing network QoS and setting priorities for various protocolsports so that the network knows which activities can afford to experience delays and which activities cant.Without QoS its entirely possible for a single device or activity ie. games torrents Netflix etc to eat the majority of the bandwidth and introduce unacceptable latency for many or all of other usersnodes.

In addition your modems public IP address is essential to communicate over the internet. If you want to hide then you can use something like a VPN but still theres a route back to you.The real issue isnt your IP address its your gateway. Your street address isnt disguised from the public bit you have some kind of security measure on your house controlling who is authorized entry even if it is just a door with a lock.

A replacement shouldnt cost more than  but it requires disassembling the entire laptop and putting it bang back together. Not that hard but requires time. A first timer could probably do it in a couple hours with a YouTube guide. An experienced tech could do it in  minutes.   Replace the charging port on the existing board.

Also you have one less program running on your computer with internet access which means there is one less potential security issue and Adobe with flash and with acrobat has a spotty track record with security issues and getting Flash to work with databases was possible but a pain and for developers Adobe did a horrible job of making things easy and consistent to implement and if devs dont want to use your technology good luck in getting it adopted. Buffering is definitively possible with HTML a bad implementation or a bug on the site I can see a developer disabling buffering to test something and then forgetting to remove that setting when he sent the code to the real site is probably going on here.HTML is good and better honest ,techsupport,crc5a9t,3,t5_2qioo

However I have had serious problems with bandwidth if the two nodes are on different electrical circuits.  I can only get mbps if I set mine up the way they need to be.  During testing I can get my full mbps internet connection wasnt able to test full LAN speed if the two nodes are on the same electrical circuit.  So if your packets have to go all the way to your circuit breaker panel and back down to another circuit it will probably lose some bandwidth.,techsupport,crpiyqo,3,t5_2qioo

Burn spots on the brick or even where it is sitting onnear your desk. Check the plugs for damage.

The way you need to do it which is easier is to load from the SSD then go into Disk Management and reformat the HDD OS partition. Not to delete folders manually. The bootloader is the part of the OS that actually loads it through. It is quite possible that you have deleted or corrupted unintentionally both. Or that the SSDs bootloader has ended up on the HDD as well. What exactly does the error for the locked drive looked like and on which step does it show up? Are there any other errors?The hard shutdown on the HDD could have been a real issue thats so. A lot of updates are not something to worry about if you have a legit OS copy and unless something freezesresets during the updating process. Can you post any screenshots from BIOS startup the error etc.?I could suggest you using another systemPC from a friend school etc. and plugging your drives externally using adapters in order to access them and test how theyd react.

The idea is to see if the drives are overall working.Changing the cables with new ones could also possibly help. If you feel like the BIOS is at fault you could try and reset it. Carefully pull the CMOS for about  seconds then put it back on place. Be very very careful! Then press the power button of the PC for  seconds to discharge any remaining power stored in the capacitors. By discharging the power the CMOS memory will reset therefor should reset the BIOS. Hopefully this would help. Post back with results! CKWD,techsupport,cs2wymz,1,t5_2qioo

That error could be the result of a particular application a driver malfunctioning hardware you name it.So...  Return that new RAM you just bought on a wild assed guess.  Then get some of the crash dumps and review them.  They will tell you what the problem is.EDIT Something else I highly recommend is enabling Driver Verifier because the DMP may be inconclusive.

Unfortunately if this modem was purchased elsewhere and it is suspected as being faulty all we can recommend to do is either contact the manufacturer to see if they can replace it via warranty or to see if they can determine the cause of the issue. Alternatively you could also purchase a new modem.  If however you bought this modem from us we may be able to assist. If you got this modem from us please open a ticket with us here and select Reddit from the drop down menu.  Please be sure to include any and all questions or concerns in your ticket.

4369643,0,t3_3azyxk,Hi thereFormatting the HDD will make data recovery even more complicated so try to avoid it. Usually Windows will display such message when it cannot read the HDD partition properly. This could happen because of too many bad sectors on the HDD or because the partition data is damaged. You should check the HDD health with the manufacturer testing tool so you would know what you are dealing with. If the HDD is passing the tests and shows good health you might try some partition recovery software. However if you are not completely sure what you are doing you might consider using the services of a data recovery specialist. If the drive is suffering from too many bad sectors or any other kind of mechanical damage accessing the HDD might cause more damage to the data. Good luck. ,techsupport,csi6zcz,1,t5_2qioo

So from the ipconfg readout your computer is connected to the device with a valid IP setup so you should be able to connect to the local area network at the very least. One thing if you could please. Do the same thing you did for ipconfig but add all after it like so ipconfig all    this gives much more information like dns servers and such. But my first analysis would be that since the device appears to have internet Up stream and Down stream are on and your computer is pulling a legitimate local IP address that this is either a routingdns issue or simply an issue with your wifi. It also looks like you have VOIP phone service through the modem. Has your phone been working fine? After you post the ipconfig all we will take a look at your router.

This will typically just contain something likegt autorungt iconNAME.icogt labelNAMEAutorun.inf.ren is something a lot more uncommon however is also usually not dangerous. What has happened is an antivirus usually Kaspersky renames the autorun.inf file to include .ren at the end. This renders the autorun file inoperable as nothing on your computer knows how to open .inf.ren files.In saying all this though autorun.inf is known to be used in viruses as it is an automation of opening software and in a viruses case installing a piece of malware.

Reinstalling Windows and recovering data for us techs is easy but it will definitely take a good amount of hours and dedication for you to figure out the process the first time. If you want to learn how to fix your computer for yourself I recommend you go through the process. If your installation of windows works with Safe Mode I think you still have a chance of salvaging it. Do you have any more accounts on your computer that you can sign in to? Maybe its just one profile that is screwed up. Try creating a new account if possible. Im not sure about AVG but Kaspersky for example has been known to mess up hardware drivers.

I used to use googles calendar sync app but I believe they phased that out a while back and its no longer free. The price on Sync is  now but if you look around online you can find discounts on it and get it for  or at least you could last month. If you use it youll want to have all your stuff in outlook then erase everything on the gmail account calendar and contacts then install Sync and it will populate google info with everything from your outlook and your phone will update from google.,techsupport,cu6gtxo,2,t5_2qioo

If that rail on your power supply isnt giving good power it could be causing the issues. SSDs can lose power but come right back online without any issues so that could be a problem. I would recommend testing your power supply as well.Another thing you can check is make sure your chipset drivers and bios are up to date. Another thing is kingston drives arnt that reliable.

For now i dont have an unit big enough to copy it whole its being delivered so i just tried to start a copy to an image file on the computers main disk just to see if there was some major hardware malfunction which might prevent it.What i got was this The drive copied very slowly. By the way this was the same behavior it had just before failing i could browse the filesystem in windows but starting a copy would make some progress at decent speed and then the speed would drop.After that i tried to mount the unit to see but the mount command was hanging.Ive also recorded a video of the drive spinning up with audio if it is of any use.

Short answer yes. If you are not explicitly calling the path msiexec i servernetlogonprogramnameinstall.msi qn and instead have this in your script msiexec i install.msi qb! you should most definitely move the msi to the same folder as your .bat file. ,techsupport,culz9z6,2,t5_2qioo

It being that high definitely raises your case temperatures which would effect the temps your GPU is running at.   Where it may not have actually fried the CPU yet it could have exasperated the damage to your GPU.  I would invest in any spots on your case you can add fans and air flow around around both your video card and CPU before the CPU dies next.   You may also want to go to your video card vendors website to see if you can get software to also set those fans to be more aggressive noise from full speed fans is annoying but dead equipment is more so.Edit You should download realtemp and watch what your machine temperatures are like when its actually running by the time you reboot and get in to your BIOS the temperatures should be steadily dropping if they are increasing in the BIOS something is markedly wrong. ,techsupport,cuoge5k,1,t5_2qioo

As far as retro gaming is concerned adding a really nice amp isnt going to make it sound any better the source audio quality is just very low being very compressed digital audio converted in the system through a cheap dac chip. When consoles started using CDs is when higher bitrate audio could be played through them.But as far as everyday use on your computer with the headphones Id definitely get a DAC first. Those cans have a pretty low impedance so they dont benefit as much from an amp but a DAC will improve your source quality dramatically which as I mentioned matters a lot. I personally have a dac hooked up to my computer that outputs through RCA cables to my oldschool mini marantz tube receiver and have my consoles and turntable hooked up to as well.

Essentially the drive can only be used on a Windows Machine.  If you want to use the Drive between both Mac and PC you have a few options.  One format the drive to ExFAT.  BACK UP ALL DATA FIRST since formatting a drive results in a loss of all data.  Once you format it to ExFAT it should work fairly well for both Mac and PC.Second option is to purchase software for Mac or PC that will allow one or the other to read the other formats.  For PC it is software that supports HFS and HFS drives and for Mac it is support for FATNTFS.  They exist but theyre usually not free.Anyway that should be all that it is.

To try and answer your questions brieflya if you can load the installation media and launch the Repair OS option it may be able to Repair your OS if it doesnt work you could try and reset the CMOS battery hence the BIOS and then try againb inserting an installation disk for a fresh install would automatically format the drivepartition you are making the fresh install on. If it doesnt and tehre are issue you could try pulling the drive out of the laptop connecting it externally to another system using a USB to SATA adapter and erasing it from there. Then plug it back in the laptop and try the fresh install again.c if all else fails including when resetting the CMOS then the drive is probably gone. Try plugging in a new one and see how it behaves.Hope this helps cheers! CKWD,techsupport,cw7klsl,2,t5_2qioo

You will have to customize the installation a bit and create a partition of  GB  MB which is plenty of room for Windows and some essential programs like your antivirus stuff. The installation program will give you that option under something like Advanced Settings. Just read carefully while youre installing and you should come across the option eventually. When Windows is installed and fully updated important! you can use Windows Disk Management to create further partitions and assign drive letters to them.I have used the method of separate partitions for Windows Programs Files etc. for years and never ran into trouble. If you want you can always opt for Windows  Programs on C and Files on e.g. D but thats up to your own preference of course.When you make regular scheduled backups of the Cdrive for instance with EaseUS Todo Backup Free and something does go wrong you can always restore your system.

That PDF makes me shudder from all the repressed memories of days spent in software hell.  These kinds of programs can be OK but its all down to the support you get from the vendor.  If they cant answer every question you have before and during the trial insist on a full trial install at your location! and make you feel good run away.  Support after the sale will only be worse than before just a matter of degree.  Find out the maintenance costs and exactly what it provides will they take support calls from users or only the network admin will they bill per hour if they decide its a workstation issue or will they take ownership and fix the thing.Also find out if its SQL based if not run away and if they supportallow connections from custom report tools.  Because you will want reports they dont have and paying them to make them will be insanely expensive compared to just making them yourself in MS access with a sql connection.  Some companies are totally cool with that others will blame every bug for all of time on you running that one report back in .If you can find out if they are the original authors of the software or if they bought it from someone else.  You would be amazed at some of the crazy stories of changing hands some industry software has with bugs nobody can fix because the guy that wrote it is out of the country or just hates them now.

Other than that Id leave them alone.If these machines use ISA controller cards and they are for production use then make sure you have some working spares that take ISA cards. For perfect ISA compatibility you need a  or Pentium class machine but its unlikely one of those would run k or XP for very good ISA compatibility a Pentium II or III with a  BXbased motherboard will work for decent ISA nonDMA and quirks compatibility even a modern specialized industrial board with ISA will work.

5823253,0,t1_cxijeg7,If you play a game that you can run at Hz or higher then you can go ahead and put your maximum framerate limit to Hz and enable VSync. There should be no screen tearing.If you play games that run at lower Fps you might want to lower your screens Hertz manually to match it. You can do that in the NVIDIA Control Panel gt Display gt Change Resolution gt Refresh Rate. So for example if your game runs at about Fps limit it with VSync or maximum framerate limit to Fps and put your screens refresh rate to Hz. That should do the trick!Keep in mind though that you have adjusted your refresh rate for all games and the desktop view. Make sure to put it back to its maximum afterwards to get the smoothest results outside of gaming or in other games.There is also a neat trick to enable VSync in games that do not have an ingame option for that. You can overwrite your games settings and enable it in the NVIDIA Control Panel gt Manage D Settings gt Program Settings. There you can pick or add your game and enable it under Vertical Synchronisation.,techsupport,cxiyc2u,2,t5_2qioo

So the good news is that your data might be intact somewhere on the drive... DO NOT WRITE on it... if you have you could have overwritten your movies. For the most part recovery software free or pay have never failed me unless i have written over that sector of the drive. so if you dont see it using those recovery software you might have already overwritten where the movies used to be. ,techsupport,cxjd9sb,1,t5_2qioo

Same in the backup and restore segment says i have not created a backup.Is windows backup the same as the WD passport backup i tried at first?Unless you use Windows backup it will keep that message. If you use rd party software I dont think the message will go away.gt Is windows backup trying to create a system image? Why do i get an error message through windows backup but not through backup and restore?There is an option to create a system image or do a continuous backup like Macs Time capsule look at my screenshot above.gt I cannot boot from an External HDD so i must have the Recovery CD as well. Should i also make a clone in my HDD? cloning means you are directly copying the hdd contents to another hard drive. when you create an image backup you are essentially doing the same thing but using it later.gtor create a RAID in my HDD? What are some extra precautions i can take?you need at least  hard drives with the same size to create a RAID. The majority of people dont use RAID.gt I tried to do a restore and it is somehow backed up into my system. I even unplugged my WD External HDD and it still shows up when i click see more restore points. I end up with  options one that says system and one that is backup. Even with the external HDD unplugged it can still somehow find the backup i put into the External drive. I am very confused. If it is saved into my SSD where can i find it? and delete it?Windows always create restore points which are basically snapshots of your Windows settings. Its not a true backup but when a something goes wrong it is a quick option you can use instead of doing a complete factory reset to fix your computer.gt How can i do a secure erase on my SSD? If it just completely jacked by a virus? boot my system CD to my HDD? and restore into my HDD? Than transfer it to my SSD and delete the one in my HDD???There are  types of erasing or formats you can do. One is quick which is basically erasing the table of contents of your hard drive so the computer doesnt recognize there is anything there. Second one is full format which is going through your entire hard drive and writing zeros to it. You can recover files after a quick format but not after a full format. Most people use a quick format even if you have a virus you should be fine. Full format takes forever and not recommended doing on an SSD too much because an SSD only has a limited amount of times it can write.Jesus you have a lot of questions that can be just Googled. Hope this is helpful.,techsupport,cxv2wae,2,t5_2qioo

Since one of the drives is WD I can recommend you Acronis True Image WD Edition which you can download and use for free. As for the procedure you can follow the steps described in this KB articleHowever before dong so I would recommend to make a backup of the most important data you have stored on both drives so it doesnt get lost.Hope this helps and feel free to ask any questions you may have.Cheers! ,techsupport,cydqpsn,1,t5_2qioo
6058447,0,t3_3y0tgk,Hi mate.Im so sorry to hear about the issue with the drive you have I know how unpleasant such a thing could be.One thing you can try to access the data in this case is to boot from Linux Live CD and see if you can access the files on the external drive that way. In order to do so you have to download and burn the ISO image to a CD or USB go in BIOS and change the boot order to the media you burned the Linux on. Once it loads you could try and mount the drive or if Linux can read it it will mount by itself and see if you can transfer the files from the external.

Never bother with WAMP stacks... they are utter garbage and next to impossible to manage...on Windows IIS or bustIf you have a dedicated home server then its often best to run a level  hypervisor so that you can spin up and down hosts remotely. Id say go with Xen or VSphere because they have the best toolchains... but the learning curve can be steep especially with VMWare so you might want to hold off until you are more comfortable with remote administration.If you are going to be using Linux in school then setting up a nice ssh server should be one of the first tasks you do... this way you can always have access to your own Linux box.  And set up a NoIP account so that you can access it via your own hostname like  ssh hiddengearzhiddengearz.ddns.net ... just remember to update the host every month or it will expire.Also be sure to have your own Desktop install with a GUI so that you can actually have fun while learning.  Its a lot easier to learn Linux when using it as a Desktop OS.  Luckily these days installers make it fairly trivial to dual boot a machine on the metal.Kubuntu and Linux mint are probably the goto choices for learning and its likely that you will be using an Ubuntu derivative at school anyway.

6421830,0,t3_43g3z0,Hello mhmd!Too bad you are experiencing such inconvenience! What is the sound like? Could you perhaps record it for us? You dont seem to have bad sectors on the HDD. The reading speed is lower than Id expect and its temperature is also a bit higher than it usually would be although in the limitations. The SMART is indicating a problem with the Interface CRC Error Count this indicates the count of errors in data transfer via the interface cable. There seem to e a bit too many. The SSD on the other hand isnt giving all the info to the second SMART checking tool no temps? and is experiencing error in x meaning the Reallocated Sectors Count. It means it has readwriteverification errors which prevent sectors to be correctly read. From what I understand the Write Test Error on your HD Tune software is because the Write test can and should only be done on an empty new drive without data on it. My advice would be to first back up your data elsewhere power down and change the SATA cables of both drives with new ones. Also change the SATA ports just in case. Then power on and use the manufacturers health checking tool on the certain drive. For the WD HDD that would be WD Data Lifeguard software Perform both Quick and Extended tests. Test the SSD as well and post the results here.Again make sure you have the back ups first! Good luck post back! CKWD,techsupport,czjjxz8,2,t5_2qioo

To do this press ctrl  shift  esc to open up task manager if you do not have the file edit view menu at the top click on the more option at the bottom left and it should make them appear. Once they appear click on File and go to Run new task. type cmd into the text bar and check the box to run as administrator. Once cmd is open type this and press enterDism Online CleanupImage CheckHealthThis is like SFC system file checker but better. This checks your system files vs what microsoft has on their server as a master copy and if anything is wrongmissingcorrupt it will replace it with a good copy.Once this is complete see if the problem happens again. If it does your next step would be to test the hard drive for faults. You can run a CHKDSK r in command promp that might findcorrect the faults or depending on the hard drive might have some software on the manufacturer website that will test the hard drive for faults. If you have a Dell computer this is built into the motherboard. While the computer is powered off press the power button and start tapping F until you get to the one time boot menu. You will see an option that says diagnostics select this and see if it comes back with any hard drive errors.Lastly it could be a memory problem.

I didnt see any creation of partitions on the PC that had the infection and Ive never heard of any malware doing that but that may have been because the staff noticed that something was wrong and reported it and then shut down every PC on the network immediately on my orders before I could arrive on site which interrupted it before it could do some real damage very little data is to be kept on the PCs but the virus did hit some network shares but because of the interruption recovery was a piece of cake the bug didnt even get to delete the shadow copies like it normally does but that could also have been because it was running on a nonadministrator account.  We do know that the complete network shutdown stopped it cold These viruses will delete themselves once they complete the encryption of the PC and any network shares it can get access too depending on user permissions and they will go after backups and shadow copies so an offsite backup is super important nowadays. It got Patient Zero the PC that got the infection and a few network shares nothing else. Downtime was about  minutes and as weve been telling the executives over there they dodged a major bullet.Ive got the virus removed from Patient Zero but its still sitting in isolation off network and completely off site at our office so I can investigate how it got infected but at this point its looking like a infected webserver ad was the cause.,techsupport,d06t8g8,2,t5_2qioo

6647771,0,t1_d06xfwv,Theres a few different questions there.Question  No windows keeps logs of everything that has happened it knows when something goes right and when something goes wrong. Windows will save every log file for its entire lifespan. It stores those logs in a huge pile of XML files. To look at them we use a windows utility called Event Viewer a powerful tool that allows us to filter and sort the giant pile of XML files for the proverbial needle in that haystack. We want to find out what happens just before and just after the game crash. We would be looking for something like thisEvent  t.sec  An error occurs a causeEvent  t.sec  an application has crashed or stopped responding the effectEvent  t.sec  Windows tried this solution but it failed Attempt at corrective action by WindowsQuestion  All games are reliant on libraries and dependencies. Most windows games require some form of directX and some redistributables andor frameworks. Some of these things namingly directX require hardware support to function. Software and hardware interface using drivers if the drivers arent there then nothing happens when a call to directX or the actual hardware is made. A driver failure will typically result in windows temporarily unloading the driver in an attempt to make the system stable again hoping that if it removes the problem all will be well once more. Windows usually succeeds with that part however sometimes windows cant reload the driver during operation. So it has to wait patiently until the next restart to load the driver normally to resume full operation. Essentially this is Windows saving you from a BSOD by cutting its own arm off. but it totally grows a new one when you reboot dont worry.Question  Drivers DirectX and Windows. How I loathe this relationship so fickle a beast that even the people that created it have questions about how it works. For simplicity sake Ill explain the issue as being like a four way intersection some people will go left and some will go right and other will go strait ahead. If theres a problem with going strait ahead it doesnt typically cause issues with others who just want to turn left or right.edit   for clarity of event viewers status as a included utility rather than a program,techsupport,d06xr3c,1,t5_2qioo

This could be due to a physical problem or data corruption or virus infection etc. Its hard to say.The chkdsk command is a tool to check the physical health of the disk and attempt repairs on the data if possible. It can be run with different switches to make it do things a little differently. The r switch I told you to try running attempts to recover bad data.Id point out that its very possible your drive is dying and should be replaced ultimately. This troubleshooting step is to try and get the drive in a healthy enough state so you stop seeing constant errors long enough to look deeper at the issue.Based on the errors you supplied it looks like some of the corrupted data on your hard drive was part of the google drive installation. So even if chckdsk manages to clean the data youll probably have to reinstall google drive to get it back to . Thats just an educated guess.Really if you see data corruption on a hard drive other than a random oneoff situation you usually want to make a serious effort to back up your data and replace it before it completely fails.,techsupport,d0dpl90,1,t5_2qioo

6743726,0,t1_d0gur5z,yeah that looks pretty bad Sespecially when you get dips to  for like  across hdd and error check picked up some sector fails that means theres more about to die soon as well but arent quite dead yet.And yeah just as I though its a crappy rpm from toshiba this model has  platters from error check looks like platter  is causing most errors but nd one had something on it as well.I would replace it if I were you backup any data you need while you still can and get a proper ssd something like samsung  evo   with as much capacity as you needcan afford. You will also see a huge improvement of actual system responsiveness especially in editing software like you mentioned  much better transfer speeds that are consistent across ssd due lack of platters.For now though chkdsk is best thing you can do or partition off bad sectors and not use them but thats an effort and a bit of a pain where you end up with several partitions of varying sizes. but thats a manual bad sector remedy if youre willing to spend some time moving data around and messing with identifying where bad sectors are and partitioning them off using the benchmark and cutting out all mbs zones.,techsupport,d0guwvz,1,t5_2qioo

Did you change both cables  two of them motherboard to drive  SATA drive to PSU  power? Did you try the SSD with the new cables on other SATA ports? You should use another PC to connect the drive internally as secondary or externally. In the first case you need to connect the SSD with new cables to a spare SATA port on another PC and enter BIOS to select that PCs original OS drive as first boot. Then look for the SSD in Disk Management. In the second option you will need to connect the SSD to another PC using USB to SATA adapter. Again look for the SSD in Disk Management. You could also try to boot to a Linuxbased Live CD connect the drive externally and look for it there.Good luck post an update soon! CKWD,techsupport,d0ulvy1,1,t5_2qioo

Certain copyright protection mechanisms will not let you simultaneously output protected video to multiple screens.So for example you may have issues if you try playing a BluRay discmovie or even when watching movies on Netflix for example so its a good idea to test that sort of stuff out too in case its a problem.You can also try using extend mode if it is a problem because I believe some protection mechanisms will still allow you to play the protected content on your primary monitor but not the secondary monitor and hopefully that would still give you audio.Just to be clear Im not saying you will run into this problem its merely a possibility.,techsupport,d1iuky5,2,t5_2qioo

7280298,0,t1_d25p85g,Well yes. From your description of what happens now Id say something is preventing your processor from initializing itself when power is applied. This means that either your processor is not receiving a clock signal highly unlikely or that it does not get enough voltage to work properly more likely than the processor clock driver not working.Your CMOS has been hard reset removed battery for some period of time so the BIOS should have reverted to factory defaults meaning that it should not be an overclocking issue.From what you describe that it took longer and longer to start up before it went completely dead I reckon that something did not work correctly when stone cold but after applying current to it for a while it warmed up and started working a bit again or at least it stopped hindering the startup. The something could either be a faulty component with one of the electrolytic condensators as a prime suspect or new possibility it could be a hairline crack in one of the printed circuits copper leads on your mobo.A technique you might consider to pinpoint the region on your mobo where the problem lies is to point an electric hair dryer at various points while the computer is trying to start and see if heating a certain part of the mobo and components on it changes anything. Disclaimer there is no guarantee of succes and it is quite possible that you will cause additional and irreversible damage. But on the other hand it isnt working anyway so more damage wont make it more dead than it already is. ,techsupport,d25pz9d,1,t5_2qioo

This is a link to download this particular driverDell which worked for me I let it detect my laptopWith Windows  the laptop would also completely shutdown automatically after being in sleep mode for a certain period of time. I later discovered in the power settings this was due it being set to go into Hibernate mode after  minutes which you can turn off. This setting is on by default I believe.

I would go the meter route because its more time efficient and an accurate rating of your system under load. You can pick one up for like  at home depot. Note Now this tells you the power that your PSU is pulling from the wall the power it is providing to the system will be less to figure out how much it is providing take the reading on the meter and multiply it by the power supplys efficiency.

7884353,0,t1_d419f08,So i should preface everything with the fact that my computer currently does work. It can currently boot up fine Im just down one hard drive. Anyway on to the questions When it crashed in January it would go to the motherboard logo screen and hang there. So yeah it was past POST. It would stay there and a little wheel would spin under the Gigabyte logo. I could hit various boot options and try to boot directly from my SSD and it would take me to various windows screens and tell me something had gone wrong. After trying all the available options I had on that screen it became clear I needed to just go back to my old windows  disc. Yeah it looked like my graphics card would not work with the original BIOS my motherboard came with. My mobo was bought in  but was probably a model from . I had never ever upgraded it in the  years until I bought my new GTX . When I set that up it would turn on...go past the motherboard logo screen again and then go to a black screen and then that was it. I spoke to a friend who said hed had a similar problem and recommend I flash my BIOS to a newer version. So i unplugged the card went back to my old one flashed my BIOS and then the new card worked. When my computer crashed back in Jan about two weeks later I turned my computer on and my card stopped working again. So basically when I flashed the BIOS the first time the motherboard logo upon booting changed. When i turned it on two weeks after the crash it had reverted to the original logo screen  so the backup bios it has in case of BIOS problems was obviously the original version which didnt like my card. So i flashed again and everything was fine.In terms of my HD yeah Im pretty sure its dead. It made a horrible clicking nose. When i boot my computer still tries to power it up....theres the same clicking and then after a while it gives up and just boots from my SSD. When i go to my computer the other HDD isnt there. When i go to device manager its not there either. Thanks!! ,techsupport,d429vlh,1,t5_2qioo

If one of the drivers has issues then yeah it could be a problem.  If you dont use the on board audio device disable it in device manager and vice versagt Also shouldnt one cable normally be able to provide all the necessary power?Ideally but doesnt mean the PSU is pushing it doesnt mean the cable isnt bad doa or has some sort of fault.  Maybe theres a manufacturing defect.gt You didnt mention the minidump reports again those are making think its most likely a software issue or should I not trust those reports?they are two separate reports with a couple weeks in between.  the first one second on the list suggest a problem with the video card andor drivers.  I assume you keep your drivers up to date and have mostly ruled that out and you seemed to rule out heat.. the next two things are bad PSU or bad Video card.  Since you got another crash that seems mostly unrelated to the first that would lead me to PSU.Granted im not sitting at your desk but Ive also seen similar to what you describe about a dozen times twice on my personal gaming system  screen lock up get fuzzy screen and then blue screenreboot depending on system settings with buzzing audio ... and replacing the PSU was the fix each time.If it start happening more and more frequently it is also a pretty good sign of something failing with the power system either a cable psu or even house power.

I also had some broken USB ports due to kittens so that MOTHERBOARD  got replaced as well due to extended warranty. Begin to install and I get a really small and slowbios in the center of the screen as almost made out by in the first screenshot  which was taken at windows install time though . I do manage to get windows installed and after a driver install later on we get the st at native res but hz and the nd no signal this is where I stand.

You said something about switching the channels but choosing channels in the .GHz spectrum is still counterintuitive If you select channel  on the modem and channel  on the router they still interfere with each otherSo it would be best to disable the wifi on the modem. It would also be good to enable some kind of bridgemode on your modem this should disable wifi and only allow for Internet on one port of the modem. This port should be connected to your router and all other wired and wireless devices will get their internet access from there. Not every deviceprovider allows that the modem is being used as a bridge so I cant tell you if this is an option for you.Last but not least look at the manual on page . The idea to rename one of the wifi networks e.g. the GHz Wifi to WifiGHz could help. Try setting the channel width to MHz only for . and leave it at Auto for GHz. MHz should be enough and you avoid interference.,techsupport,d5h1qn7,1,t5_2qioo

8377372,0,t3_4ud4sl,What kind of router do you have? There are many standards from . which is  Mbps to .ac which for home routers can go up to around . GBps. From the speed you are getting it sounds like you have a .g router which has a max speed of  Mbps. That is a theoretical max and usually you will get around half in real world measurements. Also even if you have a good router if you have a slower wifi card in your computer you will have a slower speed as it will max out at your cards speed.Alternatively if you do have a good router and card in PC it could be caused by interference from other wifi networks in the area. WiFi is a shared spectrum that means all routers in the area on the same channel need to share the bandwidth. Edit for example if you use a .ac router but a .g card in your PC you will only get .g speeds,techsupport,d5opycf,4,t5_2qioo

The actual leads that go into the PCB  metal pins and the  solder points to hold the connector in place  you dont want to NOT solder these if you plug in a cable with reasonable force youll push the connector in destroying the tracesOnly thing you can fuck up is heating the board long enough for the traces to melt and that could cause shorting.

Its best to use the manufacturer s diagnostic to see if a drive is failing like WD Data lifeguard or Seagates SeaTools. But if youre experiencing file read errors or something along those lines theres no point in testing that drive because its failing. You could try some software like GetDataBack NTFS and see if that works. It has an option to ignore bad sectors which should help your odds. ,techsupport,d6guy98,1,t5_2qioo

Take an old RCA cable cut it in half and strip the wires to expose them.  Connect one half to a battery and the other half to an LED.  Disconnect the one cable from the source and connect the V battery then go to the loose cables hanging out by the projector and use the LED plug to determine which one is alive.

Alternatively Microcenter and Newegg both sell offlease business grade laptops very inexpensively like this one  Ive generally found the build quality of offlease machines to be very good so it may be a worthwhile option to consider if youre really on a tight budget.If youre buying a new laptop do yourself a favor and dont spend south of .  tends to be the sweet spot for specsbuild for general use computing. More than that and you may well be buying more computer than you need less than that and you will likely get something made entirely of plastic that wont last long. Its always a roll of the dice but I have had more headaches repairing hardware on cheap laptops than from the  range.With respect to antivirus Windows  ships with a good enough virus scanner that tends to do a half decent job. If youre looking for something a bit better Im a fan of ESET NOD.

In this case it will lock the resolution to XXhz. to prevent monitor damage due to bad refresh rates. This is legacy behavior but some folks still use those old CRTs so....A driver set can be found at Samsungs download page for your monitor Though it officially only supports win  it is likely no more than an .inf file wrapped in an installer.

Also worth noting that Chrome especially is a RAM hog. For me personally sitting idle with a few programs running in the background and nothing really RAM intensive like Sony Vegas running Ive got GB being used that plus the  being used for rendering would put you closer to your cap. And Im not sure but I think Spotify does use quite a bit as well so just keep in mind that closing all other background apps will improve your RAM efficiency.RAM is random access memory.

9721495,0,t3_5e8urd,So all the answers youve gotten so far have been based on how sysadmins handle things at their companies. This really has nothing to do with how things work at your specific wing of government or even at other companies Ive fired a few dozen people for looking at porn on work equipment or through works network but that was at a very strict company on the issue. Theres really no way any one here will be able to tell you for sure. Its going to depend on Does all the ipads traffic VPN through the governments network or was it just hotspotting to a cell network? If its just the cellular network they wouldnt have seen the traffic to begin with and youre fine. If its all tunneled through the workgovernment network they will have logs of the activity tied to your account. Is there a policy against using the work equipment and network for viewing pornography? there probably is Is there a monitoring program in place that alerts on users trying to view pornography? Is there a team of people who investigate and respond to policy violations like this? Typically its not sysadmin work to actually enforce this kind of thing and there is a dedicated security or investigations team that keeps an eye on things like porn viewing. Ive worked on this type of team at two different companies now one of them being government related munipal not federal and I can assure you this kind of monitoring does happen and has lead to termination. I just cant tell you how your workplace handles it.I would just hold tight and hope for the best. If it does come up be honest and explain that you didnt realize your phone was connected to the hotspot and humbly ask for forgiveness.,techsupport,dabdwtf,1,t5_2qioo

Please send the file on a pastebin or something so I can check it.Also if you got any red line saying error at the end of the memtest re run the test once. If its still there you have a dead ram stick. Remove one of them and proceed to the test again. If nothing reds show up this stick is good. Make sure you test both sticks and slots as sometime the sticks are fine but the slots on the motherboard arent.If everything is fine you may run another test  I usually boot my computer on a Linux stick I would recommend you ubuntu if its your first go at Linux if possible I install it as a dual boot well I work in IT so I was going to install Linux anyway as it mitigates the risk of a crash due to the USB stick not sustaining the load and then I let it run for a few hours while using it. Since Windows is absolutely not loaded any issue involving drivers is highly unlikely it is unlikely that both the Windows and Linux drivers are faulty at the same time. This way if the computer doesnt crash that leaves only two candidates  faulty drivers in windows or if there is an hardware problem it most likely comes from the graphic card for various reasons.I recon this test process is a bit tedious but it is generally the safest route. ,techsupport,dawz5mf,1,t5_2qioo

For instance if you dont have cable availability do the other steps first.If this is a software issue as it seemed to happen when you entered Radeon settings try resetting settings for your Radeon application to default change the resolution of the blurry monitor to its native resolution if its not already. A higher resolution than what is native may result in blurriness.You can isolate the cable as an issue by swapping the cables and see if the blurry monitor clears up while the other becomes blurry.You may also try using a completely different type of cable. For example if your video card has one HDMI one DisplayPort and one VGA while youre already using the good monitor with HDMI and blurry monitor with VGA try switching out the VGA cable for a DisplayPort or HDMI cable and see if that fixes the issue or perhaps DVI if your video card has it.If the old monitor does not have anything other than the one VGA connector and youve tried everything else here you may just be looking into a different monitor.You can try resetting the blurry monitor to factory defaults. If that doesnt work see if there is a Sharpness option you can turn up to slightly compensate and see if you can still deal with it.If all else fails completely uninstall the graphics drivers restart then while using the basic graphics driver go and install the latest drivers for your card.  ,techsupport,db56y29,1,t5_2qioo

I would check CPUID HWMonitor just to make sure the CPU isnt still throttling. My old board with that CPU would throttle down the CPU even if temps were in safe regions.

On the computer you want the files to go to press Windows button  E. In the left pane of the window you should see Network. If you click on network itll show you the computers available on your network and should have the computer you just created a share on there as well. Navigate to the share you created on the PC you want the files to go to and copy them.

Youre getting around MBs on sequential readswrites which are more typical user workloads ie. copying tofrom network drive readingwriting large files etc. where data is stored on the disk sequentially. Depending on the type of drives you have this may be close to the max it can do.The MBs youre seeing is for  random reads and writes of k sectors ie. lots of small random readswrites. On a mechanical drive the head has to go all over the place to do these operations so it becomes very slow. SSDs dont have this issue because they dont have moving heads.In order to speed up those operations on mechanical drives youd need to employ some type of caching whether on the controller or by using an SSD.

Windows does need to boot so that the video card can initialize and see if there are any displays connected other than the laptops built in LCD panel.   As uBillTheCommunistCat suggested use Windows key and P after you have given the laptop some time to boot Windows.  Windows Key and P cycles between Laptop LCD Only Duplicate Extended Desktop and External Display Only.   Usually the BIOS doesnt have any settings for the second display or the external display jacks since the video card and the drivers handle that.  I hate to say this but Im wondering if Windows is fully booting or if it is stuck somewhere in the boot process and you cant tell because you have no working built in LCD display.  I primarily work on Dell laptops and they will use the external display if connected for the Dell Splash Screen the BIOS settings etc.  I dont know if Lenovo laptops do that or not.

Something like this on each corner would be a good start  The CPU fan is definitely just a standard Intel fan  nothing special and nothing to be concerned with replacing it. Look into a low profile cooler under mm such as this Phanteks Finally and this may be a bit more indepth but worth considering... Flip the power supply so that the fan is pointing up into the case and drawing air down and out rather than up from the bottom. This effectively gives you another exhaust fan. Whether this last one is possible depends on how everything is laid out and wired up beneath the PSU shroud but I think its worth looking into.PS. Dont psyche yourself out about static electricity.

My guess would be that on your screen the blue one is broken but the other two are functioning.To test if my theory is correct or notThe pixel should display correctly on this red dot  as well should it on this tint of green But on this blue it should be entirely black.Each of those dots should only turn one of the  colours of a pixel on and turn the other two entirely off. If you use other tints of red green and blue they might still be a mix of different pixels these ones should not be.If Im correct your problem is the equivalent of a death pixel not a stuck one.

10436262,0,t3_5p9sll,Remove any bits of plastic that are protruding these bits of plastic that need removing are bits ripped out from where they used to be and will stop you from being able to get the hinge all the way back in place also try to remove any small bits that are in the plastic holes that the hinge will be bonded to. You should lubricate and work the hinges a few times from their open to closed positions when I mention lubricate I dont mean spray lubricant all over the place it is very important not to get lubricant on the area to that is to be bonded spray WD onto a cottonbud until you have droplets of it showing now use the cottonbud to apply the WD to the hinges and do this a few times so that it is definitely on and running into the area needing freeing off. If you are worried about getting WD into the hinge holes to be bonded you could cover them a cotton bud will make the job easy. Once you are happy with the cleanup job and the lubricating of the hinges bond the hinge back in. Be sure to check that the hinge will go back in its original place before putting Araldite in the plastic holes and on the knurled nuts. As for clamping the hinge in place while the araldite dries you need to place a piece of protected material such as a piece of small table mat over the lids back and use something like a pair of mole grips to apply a little pressure on the hinge you would need to clamp the mole grips to the back of the lid and whatever protective material you decided to use the protection is to stop the mole grips from digging into the lid there are also many clamps that can be purchased for holding an area together while bonding. you must remember to sit the laptop down on its lid and support the rest of it so it doesnt fall over this will stop the bonding running out of the holes. You can also use more bonding to strengthen where the plastic has been broken do this later when all is done and set and working okby this I mean add more bonding around the damaged area to strengthen it. Yes you can bond it with the screws still in the nuts as long as they are tight put enough Araldite in the holes and on the nuts. You check that the hinge fits back in ok by closing the lid and then mating it up with the damaged hinge now take a look to see that the lid fits the base and the whole laptop is as should be now bond it,techsupport,dcr0qdg,1,t5_2qioo

If this is the case the cost of the PSU was the bench charge telling you everything else is shot. So when you do go to hook it up keep everything unhooked besides the ATX and CPU to the motherboard.Keep in mind that ground on the outlet and common the black wires in your PSU are the same connection.

Then put in the PCB to soften the sticky old thermal compound.  gt Spotheating the PCB where the heatsink sticks to the board components is an option if the heatsink only makes contact with one or two chips on the board.

Doesnt matter what monitors what GPU what cabling which version of Windows.Do the following.. Download the latest driver package for your video card be it from Dell or nVidia etc.. Disconnect the DPVGA adapter and monitor.  Disconnect the DPVGA adapter from the monitors cable.. With ONLY the VGA cable and VGA monitor connected go to Programs and Features and uninstall all graphics software nVidia AMD etc... Reboot.  Cancel any installs or driver updates.. Go into Device Manager.. Remove ALL display adaptors and make sure you select Remove Driver.. Reboot.  Cancel any installs or driver updates.. Check Device Manager Display Adapters and you should only see VGA. The generic one is OK.. Install the driver package you just downloaded.  Reboot.. Confirm the correct driver is installed in Device Manager.. Connect the DPVGA adapter to the second monitor and make sure the monitor is powered on and set to the VGA port THEN connect it to the PC.. The computer should flicker and acknowledge the second monitor.  You may then need to set it as mirror or extend. Let us know if that worked. ,techsupport,dd62lu8,2,t5_2qioo

You can move some files that you consider important to the secondary internal drive as well though so you can have a second copy of them on another unit.Hope this helps and feel free to ask any questions you may have. ,techsupport,dde86fs,1,t5_2qioo

That particular laptop is quite old and while that doesnt mean its necessarily bad it does mean that any upgrades will be oldish and your return on your investment is going to be weak.If you insist on upgrading Id first verify that you have a  bit version of Windows if you want to upgrade the memory.Second you can forget about upgrading the CPU on that thing.

10788447,0,t1_ddsqdth,Short Answer If you are doing a new install yes. It will be completely removed from the C drive. I see in another comment you said that you already reformatted the other drive so that should be enough.Long Answer I think thats what you meant so I could have just said yes. But I work in IT so I always try to make things painfully clear. If you only do a repair install then it wont help. If you do a completely new install of windows then it will be as if it is a brand new computer from a software perspective. The virus will be  gone from the C drive.Well technically thats not  true as it will still be on the drive but it will have all references to it removed and it will be completely neutralizedunusable. Thats what reformatting the drive does. It takes all of the information that makes the s and s usable and gets rid of it. So technically all the s and s of the virus are still on the drive but theyre basically nothing. Like if the FBI came in and did forensics on your drive then they could find the virus but you wont have it affect you. Also I see in another comment you mentioned that you didnt grab pictures.... those were probably encrypted. Unless you were going to pay the ransom that doesnt matter. Youre doing fine by the sounds of things. ,techsupport,ddsr222,4,t5_2qioo

You will see error and warning events you can ignore these only the bugcheck events matter.If you are not getting BSODs then you are getting a brownout that drops the current but not completely cuts it.

If there is a bad sector that command should find it and mark it as bad.
