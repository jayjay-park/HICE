10198258,0,t3_5m1feu,I know the comment is geared towards being a miracles pilot but its solid advice and something Ive believed for a while about cards like this.  Interesting to ponder about how sideboard cards are played and how we select them based on matchups.,nicfitmtg,dc01291,2,t5_3hnog
10260530,0,t3_5mxhbr,Sounds about right.  I dont really think you need  Scrubland myself for Junk but you may be able to buy just  and be fine with it.  Same with Savannah.Bayou is really the most important true dual.,nicfitmtg,dc7355m,1,t5_3hnog

10846082,0,t1_ddxz3kw,DampT is a matchup where Vet is always actively good as you said shaving  is fine but its definitely a card you still want to see.  They use their mana so tightly the extra basics dont really help them.I ran Path as my primary in Junk Fit.  Card is just no downside against most of the format.,nicfitmtg,ddyp3ws,1,t5_3hnog
