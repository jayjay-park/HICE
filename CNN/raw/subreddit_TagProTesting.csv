2797424,0,t1_cnm1haz,Yeah I had trouble with the corners and I think its fine if uninteresting to leave them as is. Id prefer a bomb to Reflex boosts but they both feel uninspired. Alternatively I could just make that part smaller because it doesnt add a whole lot.The superboosts are as they are because I really liked that element of Backdoor really really liked it and I figured it would transfer nicely plus I prefer the defense to have an advantage in catching up. Instead of the superboosts I could make one of them a team boost but that feels weird to me so Im keeping the superboosts.Im glad you liked it I didnt really think much of it at first but now Im really finetuning it.

The green gates in the center basically remove that section from the map nobodys ever going to use it even with the buttons there. Boosts are all forced with really no flexibility and no way to catch up to a flag carrier and the top is entirely empty. If this is an artistic map drawing a stealth aircraft then its great. But if youre shooting for making rotation read this first. Its extremely helpful to new aspiring mapmakers ,TagProTesting,co9tv2w,1,t5_35egy

No need to sugar coat anything I appreciate the honesty more than sugarcoated comments I tried to tweak some stuff let me know the issues it will have while playing the game. Center too spacey?

The only thing I really had a problem with was those double bombs on the side particularly the vertical blasts which spiked me almost every time unless I approached from a very odd angle. I made a quick edit to allow the defense to use it without punishment while still killing the offense.The button in base now controls all five of those gates not just the two diagonal ones purely to eliminate the possibility for a flag carrier to camp down there until the flag is returned.

Sometimes It doesnt process the teleport fast enough and you hit the wall behind the entrance portal which is reflected when you come out of the exit.

The pup area looks better but it still leaves the issue with the top left and bottom right corners being very extra. In Constriction there is a boost similar to this that lets you get ahead. The difference is its easy to get out ahead the other way for the defender. Here it is blocked off by the wall.

I think that would give regrab too strong an advantage.Also  bombs out in the open is a ton as is  powerups as is  total boosts. Id recommend cutting down on all of those especially the bombs as I dont see much point to most of them. Personally Id like to see the way symmetry removed as I think its generally unnecessary and doesnt add anything to maps but size but its up to you to decide if that symmetry is essential or not.I really like some of the boost routes and you definitely have riskreward working pretty well from what Ive noticed.

3539028,0,t3_30t9z0,My first impression is that its a pretty unique idea but could probably still use a little more refining. I ran around on it and had some fun with that chute but heres what came to mind. A solid defense should be hard to escape from. One player needs to just stand on that button to guard the chutes entranceexit and while on that button theyre also in pretty good position to block the stripedgate exit. The other defender need only keep contain around the open tile area. Six tiles should be jukable but I feel it will be difficult. Have you considered an offensive team boost outside of each base that can be used for grabbingescaping interchangeably? I realize you can use the bomb to grab but it doesnt help much for getting out past D especially if youre being chased closely. If you were to put the boost one or two tiles away from the side wall I dont think it would be overpowered especially since defense can get ahead really easily with the chute.. Im not totally solid on the middle area and to a lesser extent the rest of the outside path. Not that any of it is fundamentally bad I just think its a little lackluster for now. I think you could make it more exciting without making it chaotic or broken.On the other hand I like your ideas at their core. I think the chute seemed to work pretty well going into the base. Going out of base didnt really take you anywhere except into a wall but thats not really an enormous problem by any means and I imagine I could find a cooler use for it when I get more practice on it. The size of the base felt pretty good. The pup positions were OK but seem pretty easy to monopolize due to their relatively close proximity.Anyway the bottom line Great start with unique concepts that definitely have the potential to work. I would encourage adding a little excitement outside of the chute. Would love to get a v on this so definitely bring it next time we have one!,TagProTesting,cpvo6tq,2,t5_35egy

3857360,0,t3_34lhnd,You decided to use one boost for the gate boost on this one instead of the three? I like the mid boosts I like how you can use them to boost through the gap onto the flag when the bombs not there. You can hit a lot of the map with those boosts. Using them to boost top is a little tricky though as you cant see if the gates active. Maybe an indicator? Im not sure about the bomb buttons I see you can hit them from a lot of the boosts with a couple bombing you up into base which is cool but its also a little disappointing because so many routes pass over them that the bomb will always be diffused. So its tough to plan what will happen when hitting a boost because the bomb may or may not be there. Im also not sure about the boosts below the flags. The flags not on the screen when using them so its impossible to know if youll be instantly returned by a defender behind the flag when using them. Also if the FC escapes and hits that boost because the bottom routes so easy theyll be in the other base before theres time to get to the team boost. Maybe add a couple of danger spikes bottom or try to rework that area.  ,TagProTesting,cqvz36m,1,t5_35egy

4655866,0,t3_3eqer9,Spelled Precipice wrong buddy. Will test here in a bit and post some feedback.EDIT  Alright Im a noob but heres my feedback.The boosts seem really smooth. Something I like is the boost into the flags positioned so that the defender cant see the offender lining it up but at the same time the offender has to memorize how to hit the boost because he cant aim at the flag perfectly. I like the team boosts both for getting out and coming in to cap. A neat note that if a chaser is about to tag you and is ahead of you you can boost upwards hit the wall and bounce to get a cap. I like the spikes near the pups means that pup battles might be a bit more exciting. I also like how the pups are placed. It makes say a defender leave the flag with  d to go get it which could take around  seconds. Basically you arent guaranteed a pup but its still fairly easy to go get it. Im not sure how I feel about no mid pups or spikes. I like how you can position yourself just right for a bomb so that you can hit both bombs and do a neat move. All in all I like the map pretty well DEDIT DOS Also most maps have red on left and blue on right so it seems kind of wierd to have them flipped.,TagProTesting,cthfish,2,t5_35egy

9375643,0,t1_d94crcy,Id prefer to see butter with green gates seeing as right now theres no incentive to spikeas defense when you can go gate and get past a few easily.  Im not really a fan of the rest of the map either but it seems ok.,TagProTesting,d94fgn9,1,t5_35egy

11216113,0,t1_df32q4d,Ha. Basically two things could happen they liked it enough as a top map that theyll be willing to test it again automatically or they found some fatal flaws that made it really unfun for them. Either way whether or not this is a top map again doesnt have a ton to do with the changes made unless they address some specific concern that came up.,TagProTesting,df3bzqi,1,t5_35egy
