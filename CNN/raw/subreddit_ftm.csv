2752,0,t1_ceejl5v,I had phalloplasty in Belgium and this is news to me.  Its been a long time since I had my original consultation but I feel like I asked them about what tissue they use and was told they only use the forearm tissue.  I go back in March for the implants so I can confirm then I guess.In any case the scar is longer on the inside of my arm which is what they used for the urethra.  I assume thats the extra length needed to connect with my native urethra.I also had a scope done a couple months ago because I was concerned I had a stricture and there was definitely only one connection.,ftm,ceer265,3,t5_2t9mw

21504,0,t1_cegvl5q,I was just starting a little less than  months but Ive known him since pre t online. He had no idea just assumed I was a fem boy. But when he asked me out I told him and he moved in about  months later. I didnt have too many changes at the time. I was also suuuuper self conscious what with having just started. He came from a conservative area and really wasnt aware what transmen were. It was thank goodness a pleasant experience to learn who I was with him.

143707,1,t3_1vq9r7,So I have a theory by no means is it completely correct. The steryotypical white male is often percived by the LGBT community as being the enemy the one who is oppressive and getting in the way of the rights of a minority.  Maybe the group you are hanging out with has internalized a dislike or disgust because of a fear or distrust of this kind of person. And here you are trying to become male. They arnt right to do this but maybe they are shunning your joy at becoming masculine because they veiw masculinity as the enemy. As someone who was buth you were still female and thus the masculinity they saw was undermined in a way.  Im making so many assumptions and generalizations here its crazy and thats probably only a part of the story. ,ftm,ceusry3,3,t5_2t9mw

240173,0,t3_1wspou,gt Ive been really hurt. I was kind of shocked to be honest.Try not to take it personally sometimes youll meet people who have been hurt and lash out in bad ways against what they perceive as threats even if it was never meant that way. Some people are just assholes too no community is immune.gt I know Im not transgendered but does that mean theres a problem with me being attracted to someone who is?Theres no problem as long as you stay respectful and a basic Good Human Being.gt I know I cant possibly know how it feels to feel out of place in my body but does that mean Im not welcome in this community anymore?No one persons negative reaction does not represent a whole community. Certainly telling you to stick to your own people or to not encroach onto our community is nothing but toxic no one should ever have to be told that.Youre justified in being hurt and shocked but try your best to absorb and neutralize that negativity rather than reflect it back. Give people the benefit of the doubt some may have been hurt in the past in ways youll never learn.

1050053,0,t3_264taq,By request Trigger WarningEveryone goes at their own pace. The first time I came out was to my ex almost six years ago after watching a ton of YouTube videos and realizing that these guys were voicing what I had been feeling since I was two. I came out again after being shoved back into a closet by my ex two years ago to my partner. Though he didnt really understand what I was getting at he was more supportive. Then a little over a year ago I came out on a much larger scale after dealing with depression and anxiety that only became worse as time wore on. Something in me snapped and my tolerance for trying to deal with it was gone. It was transition or kill myself. I had a gun under my bed. I know very well how to use them. So I began transitioning socially and after only a couple months because I had been presenting as male online for many years and had already come out to partners and friends I got my script for T. For our friends and family it seems very fast but many of us have been thinking about this for years. By the time we begin transitioning its the only logical next step.,ftm,chnn9bs,3,t5_2t9mw

1255892,0,t1_ciat5r4,Yes my T comes in a ml vial and then I buy needles and syringes separately.  Ive never heard of T coming inside a syringe unless your doctors office filled them like that for you?  Do you literally have a number of these filled syringes lying around waiting for your next shot?If so I imagine it would make little difference if you only inject half finding the halfway mark manually should be easiest and just switching needles for the next time.  But you could just as easily draw from the syringe into one with smaller demarcations if you want more control over determining the exact dose.If your syringes are freshly filled for each shot though then I dont know if leaving the T inside a plastic syringe for any amount of time might negatively effect it somehow.  It seems a terribly peculiar practice to me.As for Buck Angel that buzzyness as I understand it goes hand in hand with transitioning past your s outlined and explained better in that paper I linked earlier as the voicebox completes ossification quicker on T the older you are.  If youre under  you probably dont have to worry about it at all.  What makes him sound gay isnt the buzzyness but rather his speech patterns.  Theres a world of difference between the way men speak and the way women speak and very little of it has to do with how deep your voice is.  When a malerange voice speaks with a female pattern thats what gives us the impression of an effeminate or gay voice.  Here are some of my recordings remember that I only got on a lower dose after the first month.  Also ignore the lisp braces are a bitch to talk past. PreT wks  month wks wks  monthsI made an error in how I phrased my dosages there I meant to say upping by  every  months which is doubling it after the first  months taking it to mg.  I chose this dosing regime based on personal preference and little more  month increments convenient for blood testdoc appointments a slow titration upwards is easier to adapt to means Im on a low dose until the end of the year which gives me time to inform my family whos all far away.  According to the paper I drew most of the voice information from linked in previous post the only requirements stated were a low dose over  months which is loosely defined as around mg.  In short everyones going to handle dosages differently so pick something to start with and see how it goes.  mg feels very low to me and I cant wait to up it at the end of the month.  I couldve just gone and upped in anyway if I wanted but Im trying to meddle with the dosages as little as possible whilst I wait for my appointment.  My doc told me that the body changes in  month increments which is why initial blood tests are always at three months.  For that reason Id personally rather stay on the same dose for  months before upping it but Ive seen plenty of people refer to titration on a monthly or sometimes even weekly basis.  If you want to do this Id say do some research and choose a path that you think will best suit your goals.For me I go to a GP and not an Endo but hes also the only one prescribingdealing with trans stuff in this half of the country so Im pretty much in the same boat.  In the end youre going to have to decide whats good for you.  Have you tried calling your Endos office and just asking how he feels about you altering your dose?  Try that first and if you cant get ahold of him just send an email or leave a message to the effect you suggest.  You can hardly do anything more.  Your health and happiness comes first and if your meds were causing issues for ANY other kind of prescribed med what would you do?  Stop taking it right?  Or take less of it?  If you couldnt get ahold of your doc etc?  I would so why should T be any different?  For the record I sent a mail pretty much to the same effect to my Doc when all other communication routes failed I never did get a reply.  If you do go to the visit in  months and he has an issue then at least you know you were responsible and did everything in your power to handle it officially.

1477427,0,t3_2aecva,Im not sure about BC but I work at a fertility clinic in Ontario and under the law you need to be a close relativefriend of the intended parent to donate your eggs otherwise they consider this tissue trafficking.  Becoming a donor involves essentially going through an IVF cycle where they will put you on the birth control pill for a month to essentially reset your cycle then a month of injections of  different medications. Im also present during the egg retrieval process which is quite uncomfortable since youre bloated and your ovaries are huge and they use a needle to extract the eggs.  There is also a large time commitment involved while they do internal ultrasound and bloodwork on a semidaily basis leading up to the retrieval. This is all for a typical cycle heads up Im not a doctor!I think its amazing that you would consider this because I see a lot of couples that put everything they have into trying to have kids but it is a very big personal commitment and very invasive for the donor. The fact that youre a minor may also complicate things since in Ontario youre required to go to a counselling session to make sure you understand the physicalpsychological implications of donating and you have to sign consent since its considered surgery so Im not sure if you could do that without parental consent being under . I apologize if thats way more than you wantedneeded to know but a lot of times people dont realize what a big deal it is.

Same thing would have happened if youd been considering David or Kyle or whatever. My name is a unique situation. My given first name is traditionally male but Ive always been called by a very female nickname and my last name is strongly female gendered its a cultural thing. So after much pondering Ive decided to keep my given first name change my last name to its male equivalent which means something pretty badass whereas the female one means something stupid and I changed my nickname to its closest male equivalent. Except I dont really feel that attached to the new nickname. So the usual advice with names is to look up popular baby names from your birth year.

2035173,0,t3_2i1hcp,I switched to subq after about two and a half years on IM  months ago.  Ive had my levels checked once or twice since then and theyve been the same as they were before I take mgweek.  Although my motivation for switching was the smaller needle I now no longer get the muscle pains I used to get after doing my shot.  Surprisingly the needle still hurts just as much going in but I assume thats just a psychological thing because any time I get blood work done I get much larger needles shoved into me and dont feel a thing because Im not the one doing it.  I switched without asking my doctor first  I just bought new needles online and started using them  but I told him at my next appointment and he was fine with it and when I first started T I remember him saying I could switch to subq if I couldnt selfinject IM.,ftm,ckyik6b,1,t5_2t9mw

2074380,0,t1_cl39e6k,gt if someone were to tell me I had to go to therapy before I could start hormones would seem to me to be a violation of my autonomySo I also started T on informed consent and went to therapy just because I felt that was helpful to me personally but I think theres a difference between being told you may not start T and being told you cannot start T.  Just because the NHS isnt paying for it doesnt mean its forbidden by law.  The thing violating ones autonomy in the UK is not having the financial resources to go to a private doctor.  This isnt any different than some US insurance companies making asinine rules about when trans medical care is covered and when it isnt.,ftm,cl3hz6z,1,t5_2t9mw

Maybe the cylinder is too wide? This one www.amazon.comSizeMattersClitorisEnhancementKitdpBIYMQ comes with  different sized cylinders and when I used the medium one my dick had a much more foreskiny look to it afterwards than when I used the small.

2110989,0,t3_2j25oj,Face the camera straighton smile like a normal human being no duckface etc. and take a few pics.  Review.  Is that a curtain rod impaling your ear?  Better move to another spot in the house.  Or do you look like the crypt keeper?  Better not stand directly under the light source this time.I have a good side and a bad side.  What works best for me is facing the camera directly then turning my head just slightly to one side showing off more of my good side to the camera.  My haircut and face look better from this angle than from the other side.I spend a lot of time in rtranspassing and my pet peeves with the ftm selfies can be broken down into a simple dodo not list.  This is meant to be helpfulfunny and is not directed at any one person so yeah. DO smile.  Almost everyone looks better with a smile.  Its okay to have some straightfaced pictures too but throw some smiles in there.  One day you might want to show pictures of your younger self and it might be nice if you didnt look mad. If youre worried it makes you look feminine take this time to learn to smile the way you want to!  I have learned to smile more by using my cheeks which draws my lips thinner.  I used to smile using just my lips and that puffed them out and made them look way bigger than they really are and more feminine.DONT contort your body into some weird bent over gargoyle pose.  Most men arent doing silly poses and weird high downward angles to make themselves look skinnier or whatever.DO push your glasses up.  It looks really sloppy to have your glasses at the tip of your nose with the frames eclipsing your irispupil.  Then its just a selfie of your glasses.  Hard to look manly when youre wearing your glasses like a grandma.DONT make a weird pirate face duck face whatever... Fun pictures are fun but if youre legitimately wanting to pass in a selfie you may want to hold off on the silly faces until you have some scruff. DO take many pictures and try different light angles backgrounds etc.  By angles I mean you can look straight at the camera or turn your head or go complete profile. DONT take your selfie in a mirror unless youre trying to show off your body.  I am making a big generalization here but I hardly see guys doing a bathroom selfie unless theyve hit the gym and want to show off their new sixpack or theyve bought a new sweater they want to debut.  The mirror selfie is good for showing your body off because otherwise you have to do the previously mentioned gargoyle move to fit yourself in the frame but the dried water spots and smudges on the mirror are not very good at pictures focusing on the face.Pretty much just take lots of pictures and pick your favourite ones.  I find that I have a hard time achieving peak attractiveness and masculinity at the same time in mine.  There are some angles that make me look more attractive as a human but less masculine than some other angles that arent so flattering with my facial structure.  I find a nice inbetween and thats usually what I go with.,ftm,cl85guz,3,t5_2t9mw

2205823,0,t3_2kcy8p,Congratulations! The thing I struggled with most was just taking it easy. I wanted to do stuff before I was ready. Especially drive. But be safe and patient. Driving is not as easy as you might think with turning the wheel and stuff. A friend of mine told me dont lift anything heavier than a cookie and I think thats good advice for the first week or two. Good luck. Its gonna be great. I walk around bare chested at home all the time now and it feels incredible. I wish I had trimmedshaved my armpit hair before surgery. I felt really gross and stinky even after I was able to shower. It took a couple weeks before I felt like I was back to normal. I was glad I cut my fingertoenails and got a haircut before surgery since I was not up to any of those tasks for about  weeks. I also got a little robot vacuum to help me keep the house clean but that might be going a little overboard haha. Slip on shoes were very helpful as were straws and plastic cupsdishes. I was too weak to lift a full glass for that first week or two. Oh and I cooked a lot of stuff in advance and put it in the freezer so I could just defrost heat and eat. I had to borrow a countertop microwave from a friend since mine is elevated over my stove. But it was great to have home cooked food to eat. My friends brought stuff over for me too so I ended up being very well fed. Having friends around for the first week was key for me because I couldnt really get in and out of bed on my own until the drains came out. Im not sure if that was because of the drains or because that first week is just so arduous. ,ftm,clk7phw,3,t5_2t9mw

2232278,0,t3_2koq6e,The only thing I can think of happening is that you have increased soreness in your leg when giving your shot immediately before or after exercising mostly because youre tensing up your muscles.  As hefaestos said T is a slow releasing injection which means you wont feel any effects immediately after the shot. So in terms of heartliver function exercising right beforeafter shouldnt have any adverse effects. If you are interested in increasing the effect of your workouts I would suggest looking into supplements such as protein to eat beforeafter your workout.  You could probably find a lot more on that over at rfitness. ,ftm,clnkqmj,1,t5_2t9mw
2243559,0,t1_clp00cs,It depends on who the new person is. What circle did you meet them in? If they are from an LGBT circle leatherkink circle social justice circle then out. If not like in my case from a exclusively work circle or heavy metal circle or pet rescue circle then not out. It gets easier to compartmentalize the longer I have lived in a certain place Seattle and the longer I see who is who and what is what. Im super lucky in that despite my baldness coming from my mothers side I havent gone bald and I dont think I will. I dont think we know everything we think we know about genetics in this regard. My dads brother went partially bald he did not. Every male on my mothers side except her youngest brother went completely bald. My uncle her youngest brother has a full head of hair at age . My hairline has receded slightly but I did not go bald and I look most like my mothers youngest brother. I am actually growing my hair out for my headbanger circle and its really fun and affirming to pass as a dude with long hair.Advice? Find a way to value yourself no matter what other peoples opinions are. Love yourself validate yourself now. No matter how much you pass no matter how much others read you as a man or find you dateable andor desireable no matter what  love yourself no matter what. You are a unique and amazing human being and the fact that you got this far no matter where you are at in your transition speaks volumes for your selfawareness and your capacity for selflove. At the same time increase your awareness around your behavior so you can transmit that love to others. I highly recommend bell hooks book All About Love and Kate Bornsteins Hello Cruel World. Take care of yourself while helping others. Both are equally important.I also find the positive affirmations of Andrew W.K. to be helpful.

My freshman year of college I was too scared to go in as male full time so I pushed myself into being female but halfway through the year Id realized Id made a mistake and it was something I couldnt push down.To be honest I did study a bit. I will second the idea that youre already a guyyou dont need to change you! But when you pass to strangers and they start asking you about football or whatever Im personally really into hockey but I know nothing about any other sports sometimes you want to be able to hold a conversation on that topic. Im actually a huge fan of The Art of Manliness. Its a website that kind of teaches you all the manly skills and values that your father presumably didnt. I felt as a man it was important to me to foster a sense of selfreliance. I learned how to troubleshoot basic car problems and change oil. I lift weights and exercise.

Obviously what you tell him depends on his age like if hes really young you should just be able to say to him something like hey I know maybe you think Im a girl but actually Im a boy so please call me itoen now. And generally he should accept it though he might have some questions. Dont let your stepmothers bs get to him first and turn him against you.

2460513,0,t3_2nj7uf,Simplest explanation Sexual orientation is who you want to go to bed with gender identity is who you want to go to bed as.Talking to other parents will help your mom enormously when shes ready to do that  which might be in a few days or a few weeks or several years. She should join  when shes ready. Its an outstanding parentsonly group for parents of Trans folks. It goes way beyond You should support your kid theres lots there for her even if she thinks shes already supportive and she will get a lot of very helpful information there. Other parents will help her understand why being Trans isnt an extreme form of being gay. Frame it in terms of her getting her needs met not a means to an end where you get your needs met. Shes a lot more likely to be receptive to the idea if she doesnt think its just a ploy to get her to give you what you want. Its hugely important for her to talk to other parents just as important as it is for you to talk to other Trans people. Its not healthy for you or for her if youre her only connection to what to her is a very foreign and possibly very frightening world. She needs to hear other parents  NOT just you  tell her that you should be trusted to know yourself and that you are not doomed because youre Trans. Yes you will find love yes you will find a jobcareer yes you will be happy no you will not be outcast from society no you will not be looked at as a freak wherever you go no you will not be alone and miserable forever. Parents worry about that stuff. You can reassure her but ultimately its reassurance from other parents whose kids have transitioned and miraculously! turned out fine and live happy lives thats going to convince her.Heres some other stuff she might benefit from reading  never give or recommend anything you havent first read yourself!

2528590,0,t3_2omoki,I absolutely relate to this. To most of what youve said in fact. For a while I was friendless due to how I felt as I almost didnt feel adequate to hang out with cis men and I felt like I would be read wrong if I hang out with my lesbian friends.I have happily got to a point where both feel pretty much comfortable for me now. Pretty sure nobody would ever take me for a lesbian anymore and the other day I used a urinal for the first time ever!It has taken a lot to get to this point and I still have a long way to go to get to a place I am content with. Like you I felt phalloplasty was medically necessary for me and I am almost at the end of my surgeries with that. Its been seriously tough going but its been worth it. I can now see a future where I have a relationship and I can see myself feeling normal. Im currently trying to track down a not overpriced therapist to battle my way through some anxieties and worries as I feel theyre holding me back but if I compare the me that exists now to the one that existed two or three years ago Im in such a better and more comfortable place. I dont even think these anxieties and worries are completely due to transition maybe related but Ive always been shy and anxious and I wonder if its just inbuilt into me.I have had to make my peace with some things. I will never have genetic children. I doubt I will ever have random hook ups not that they appeal to me really. I wont have random boners and Ill never really understand how they feel although I do have this sense of what theyd be like. I do think dating might be more difficult but thats perhaps negative of me as I know a few other trans guys in super happy and stable relationships.Its sad that parts of my life will be affected by my transition but prior to transition my WHOLE life was affected by my feelings about my gender and the incongruity between my brain and body. So thats a better life I figure.Its annoying to say but time does help. Surgery has helped. Im sure it wouldnt for everyone but for me it has. I hope that a bit of therapy will help me too as I can often recognise when the pattern of negative thinking happens but I just cant seem to stop it.Dont let it get on top of you too much. Always talk about it as bottling it up doesnt help. You can always message me or make a post on here. This place is great for support!,ftm,cmomfp2,4,t5_2t9mw
2529276,0,t3_2omoki,i had a friend who injured himself as a child and severed his testicles. he had to take replacement testosterone. i knew a guy in college who couldnt get erections on his own. i have cismale buddies who sit to pee. i know dudes who dont use a urinal or who worry so much about how small their dicks are they dont hook up with girls they havent dated for a while. i know a guy who cant produce viable sperm if he and his wife want to give birth to a baby theyll have to use a donor just like me and my wife will.i say all this to really say all guys are different. and all guys have stuff we struggle with. i like to remember the broad spectrum of experiences and insecurities that i know all guys live with all the time. im a dude who had a physical disruption i had to learn to overcome. so are you. but that doesnt make you any less of a guy.,ftm,cmopnqg,29,t5_2t9mw

2750850,0,t3_2rkgh1,To state the obvious you are facing some interesting tradeoffs.Allow me to parse your choices to two. You can attempt transition where you are or you can find a more friendly place to transition. Based on what you wrote the option of not transitioning isnt viable.You might be surprised at your acceptance in your current location youve been surprised so far. It might go just fine or at least fine enough.The advantage of being proactive about moving is that youre more in control. Its always easier to find a job when you have a job. I dont know how the market is for teachers where you want to be but if youre dismissed from your current job it will be harder to find a new one.  Better to preempt that possibility if its likely. Thats the rub you dont know how likely it is.The last comment Ill make is to ask you whether you really want to stay where you are long term. In the best scenario where you successfully transition and get tenure how difficult will it be to live is a small town in the Bible Belt? Is this what you want to do long term? If not then bite the bullet now and work on changing things it makes little sense to work for tenure that will allow you to stay where you dont want to be.Good luck.

2799011,0,t3_2s4b4v,Hey so I grew up in a household with two people who struggled with anorexia  body dysmorphia. Suffice it to say I did not have the healthiest opinions about my body. While I am not going to claim I know what you went through I experienced a mild form body dysmorphia at least according to my therapists and was bulimic from the ages of . My entire life I loathed every curve flab and feminine nuance of my body. I hated myself when I looked in the mirror. I hated clothes. I hated getting dressed in the morning. BUT I chalked it up to All woman hate their bodies this much Thanks for that line of thinking Mom!. However after a while I started to wonder whether this hatred had a different source. I ventured into dressing male and binding and it was like... I dont know... this burden of selfhatred that I carried for so long just disappeared. I dont hate myself anymore I dont hate my body and my selfworth is no longer correlated with how much weight I can lose. The moral of my long winded story is this Focusing on your body might bring up traumatic memories. You might look at transition and think damn I do not want to spend every waking moment focusing on what I hate about myself. Thats what I thought too when I first started transitioning. I thought it would be the same kind of hell like dysmorphia was. But it isnt. Instead every day I feel more and more at peace. Happier. Whereas when I throwing up or skipping meals every day there was a new flaw to look at.In my experience I dont think transition will derail your life. I dont think it compares with dysmorphia as much as it might seem. It is way more positive.,ftm,cnm8ju9,2,t5_2t9mw

2816712,0,t3_2sci05,I have not yet started T but a lot of what youve described struck me hard as something I dealt with for years. Youre definitely not alone. As a teacher Id be in the middle of running my classroom when the derealization would hit everything felt like a dream I couldnt focus and I just wanted to curl into a ball in bed until I felt normal.I saw two different general practitioner doctors. They ran a CMP complete metabolic panel checking liverkidneyetc thyroid vitamin D vitamin B hematocrit. They ran lupus tests a sleep study blood pressure panels. a heart rate monitor to check for heart problems holter monitor did two different blood glucose tests under the insistence of one of my doctors that it was hypoglycemia and everything came back clear.One of my doctors thought that stress was causing my lower back muscles to squeeze on my lumbar nerves and that it was causing issues and prescribed me muscle relaxants. The relaxers did the trick but not in an expected way  they simply brought me down to feeling normal rather than doing anything for my muscles.After working with both doctors and a therapist running back and forth from office to office trying to figure out what was going on for months I finally relented and started taking a low level antianxiety. My episodes identical to what you described stopped at first then became worse. They switched me to the SSRI escitalopram generic for lexapro which is for GAD and depression upon my  therapists insistent diagnosis of GAD and atypical depression and the episodes stopped completely.I was hesitant to go on any medication at all especially an SSRI but I was unable to function and couldnt handle feeling the way I was feeling a sentiment you seem to be experiencing now. While I cant attest to your experiences with T I can say that as a hormone T may have an effect on depressionanxiety since sometimes both are hormonallylinked though GAD and depression are also multifactoral and several different things both physiological and psychological play a role.I am not a doctor. I have not yet started T. But my unprofessional hypothesis would be that T is probably playing a minor role in setting off something you are predisposed to. I am blessed to have good insurance through work and all of my tests were free all of my doctors costs were visit but if you can I would recommend a similar course of action ruling out physical causes and perhaps trying an SSRI if you can. I do not say this lightly as I am usually strongly against SSRIs but I know how unbearable life can be during episodes of GAD depression and derealization in its varying forms.I can only hope this helped. Please know you are not alone. If you ever need anything even if its just to vent Im a PM away. Best of luck.,ftm,cno94f4,1,t5_2t9mw
2818751,0,t3_2sd0ik,One thing to bear in mind is that passing appears to be some sort of arms race as masculinization technology improves so does the acceptance of masculine traits in women which in turn drives trans men to use more masculinizing tech.  T was not needed as much to pass in the past since it was inconceivable that gender roles were bendable. We definitely know of men who upon death were discovered to be women. Theres even a monument to one of them in my home town the monument is for her voting in an election held in that place.  I the monument find highly problematic a western stage coach driver  ! Its a bit of a minefield to label people retroactively  the th century feminists have very often claimed these female bodied but male gendered people as women who defied the oddsstereotypesetc and used them for their political goals.So long as you arent triggered too badly by that bullshit you can find very many reports of women who lived as men in the womens studieshistory section for just about any culture which is commonly studied.,ftm,cnohh4e,2,t5_2t9mw

2827018,0,t3_2rwe3h,Sorry if this is late or something im kinda new here. I just wanted to get this off my chest I guess.When I was younger I didnt actually understand that people were different from each other until I guess my older brother brought it to my attention. Wed argue about a lot of things regarding gender stuff like the difference between having a chest or breasts. I constantly argued that I wasnt getting them. Or that Id have children. At one point he told me people could change from boy to girl or vice versa and Id said Id grow up and be a boy. Of course I was  and didnt really understand much of what he was saying he was a genius he could have very honestly gone to college as a child As a child I also liked to imagine what everyone I knew would look like when they got older but I just couldnt imagine myself growing up at all. I felt entirely disconnected from words such as mother wife grandmother and did my best to not think about it.Well before puberty my mother always bought my clothes and I never really had a say. Most of the time I didnt really care. I mean I guess I was lucky through most of my childhood that I was just unaware. My brother and I were raised practically the same. Our grandma taught us both how to knit dance among other things.we both played with whatever toys we wanted mostly dinosaurs and cars it was pretty great. But when I went to school it was strange because I was expected to be friends with a bunch of girls. I mostly got along with the other boys until we got to the age where everyone kinda split up and cooties were a thing. I got into this little friend group with these girls who basically acted like stereotypical teen girls at the time tho they were  and it was honestly one of the worst things that happened. I really wanted to have some friends so I was desperate and did what I could to fit in. I stayed like that until I was about  even though Id gotten rid of the by the time I was . Throughout all of this Id become depressed by th grade. I blocked out of my past and am finally remembering it now that I got out of a bad home life. When I was about  I had many online accounts and for whatever reason decided to put my gender as male for many. In real life I didnt even own any regular tshirts only very feminine clothing. The only things I truly enjoyed wearing were handmedowns from my bro and this hawaaiin shirt my dad had let me have to wear over tshirts. When I was online I began seeing a few people a little older than me going threw transitions and I became incredibly interested for reasons I didnt understand. I didnt really think much of it for a couple more years though. I spiraled further into my depression throughout middle school and the first years of high school. In sophomore year I entertained the idea of crossdressing and actually went through with it for the heck of it a couple times using sports bras and a but up pair of tights to bind. I had never felt more comfortable in my own skin. I finally came out last year over doing a ton of research on what I could do next. People at my school were and are generally accepting and call me by the correct name. Although home was different story completely I had to leave and move to my fathers who is much more accepting. Hes very christian but hes calling me by the right name and trying to figure this all out.So I guess it wasnt exactly just one tipping point it was pretty gradual and for the most part it was always there I just didnt know what it was at the time.Sorry for how long this was c,ftm,cnpfdth,1,t5_2t9mw

In contrast I started out on mg a week .cc of mgmL done subq and that lead to my levels being dangerously high. My low levels were clocking in around ngdL versus the ngdL they were hoping for. At that level I was experiencing headaches blurry vision and shark week made a brief return due to my testosterone potentially converting back to estrogen. My dose was bumped down to mg a week after that and I stayed on that dose up until recently where I was bumped back up to mg much more successfully this time. I have to go back in to check my levels but that was more than enough to put me at the healthy range that my doctor was hoping for. For frame of reference though I also had naturally high T levels before starting so my doctor had to work around that variable when determining my starting dose. Even without testosterone my natural range is around ngdL ,ftm,cnzjaqk,1,t5_2t9mw

2960238,0,t3_2u0yju,There seems to be a sociopolitical aspect to this with her identity being tied to being a lesbian. Youre a dude right? Youve always been a dude. So theoretically either she never connected with the real you or she did and fell for you anyway. I mean if youre male but you connected anyway that leads me to think theres hope for you as you transition chemistrywise. But shed have to give up her identity as a lesbian. As in there are probably a fair amount of people who identify as lesbian who are possibly actually . or lower on the Kinsey scale but wouldnt explore it because theyd have to give up their identity regardless of if that title was  descriptive of their interests.For the record I am one if those people who thinks most people are at least slightly bisexual but most people who never explore it have socialwhatever reasons not to explore it.Anyway its hard for her to give up her identity right? Its really important to her. But your identity as a man matters just as much. I do not see this working in the long term if you dont transition. Im really sorry but if youre anything like me you have to do this. You may lose her maybe you could stay friends but I dont see how you could stay the rest of your life with someone youd have to lie to be with.Shes already married to a dude anyway.

My folks were going through their own process and I think theyre allowed to air their feelings whatever they are. The fact that my mother doesnt want me to lose my breasts doesnt actually stop her from accepting my dudely chest.

2969329,0,t3_2u6dl0,Options include getting someone else to inject close friend partner etc.  disadvantages are that they might be busy or move or break up or something using gel disadvantages include cost needing to do it daily it transferring to other people and difficulty absorbing it leading to low levels and learning to deal with selfinjection disadvantages are obvious. A lot of people get over their fear of needles after their first few injections or learn some strategies to cope but its also not uncommon for people to have someone like a partner do it for them. My suggestion if you do that would be to have a good back up plan for if theyre suddenly unable or unwilling to do it. Decisions about gel vs injections include a lot of other factors  if you search this subreddit or the internet in general you can find info about that. If youre in a country where you can get Nebido you generally arent allowed to selfinject and have to go to a doctor every  weeks but for the most part people on weekly or biweekly injections do it at home. Subcutaneous injections use needles that are a lot smaller which could help depending on what your specific problem with needles is. ,ftm,co5mlig,2,t5_2t9mw

Splitting hairs about the meaning of generally understood terminology is not productive.I am really confused by your way of thinking and Im not sure if a forum like this is going to help you get the answers your behavior may be intended to elicit. I I think this may be an angry passive aggressive cry for help.I encourage you to reach out to a trans person in your community who can help you wrestle with these ideas in person. It must be bothering you. There are ways to reconcile your upbringing with your gender. You dont have to take on the anger and hatred of your community and channel it outward either.

The best thing about it is that you can literally get it as tight as you wantneed to since you just pull it over and the velcro can stick at any point.

3032044,0,t3_2uwcoh,I think its a really common misconception that females are born with all the eggs that theyre going to have and they just sit in their little pouches waiting to be released. Thats not true. Eggs develop similarly to how sperm develops. Testosterone stops the development and subsequent ovulation of eggs so its not like you have all these eggs inside of you that are going to dry up. If you went off T your eggs would begin to develop again when female hormones allow it. I personally didnt consider preserving them before T because it really is invasive. To harvest eggs you have to take a long round of high doses of female hormones and the procedure to actually harvest the eggs can be painful and probably mentally draining. You could always stop T and go through this process if you wanted to find a surrogate for example and not be pregnant yourself. So no your eggs wont dry up and you are able to stop T and have a genetic child if you are willing to go through the process. ,ftm,coc9pfq,3,t5_2t9mw

It can force your style into a more rigid set of rules if you want to pass consistently.As far as privileges and stuff go... uh... I dont know. The only privilege I actually liked when people read me as a woman was getting banged out by straight nerdy guys a bunch of times. But it was also a hollow terrible experience because knowing that a straight man was attracted to my body usually made me feel sick with myself and I would brood about it all day at school and work.Being a man isnt really about respect leadership or muscles. Its your gender. Its who you are in your brain.Also  I did go from swimming in a mens XS to bursting out of a mens M between when I was taking a break from testosterone and  months back on.

3078135,0,t1_cogztxn,AgreePlanned Parenthood outfits arent following a standard so they adopt informed consent policies here and there. Every location does not offer LGBT health services. Asking other trans people is the best way. Some general practitioners and endocrinologists who do prescribe hormones may require a referral letter from a therapist. If you ask and know the provider you want to use requires therapy set up therapy appointments now so youll have that letter by July. Informed consent places generally dont require therapy. EDIT TO ADDDR. RIXT LUIKENAAR SALT LAKE CITY UTAH.Greenwood Clinic  S. State St. Midvale Utah.  a.m. to  p.m. Wavookareddit March From what I gathered during a phonecall to the clinicThey offer prescriptions for HRT on the first visit. The clinic is held once a month. Typically on third Friday of every month.Walkins are acceptable although appointment is preferred.They offer a sliding fee scale for those uninsured. Besides from offering hormones they provide other medical care in a transpositive environment. Im not sure as to how broadly they define this though. Here is a link to the health center that the clinic is located in. I searched high and low but it doesnt mention transrelated health care anywhere on the site but it does have contactbiographical information for the doctor running the clinic.EDIT  So going into a potential unknown I would trust word of mouth recommendations from other trans patients but when you deal with the receptionist on the phone I would keep it vague and just request a new patient appointment. Answer any insurance information they ask you. When youre actually IN the appointment with the doctor thats when you say Im transgender I need you to prescribe testosterone and manage my blood work.EDIT  Look at uttimewithdans comment below,ftm,coh1o77,3,t5_2t9mw

3094403,0,t3_2vhsho,I never had a good relationship with my mother. She passed away in  after an almost  year battle with cancer then a lung infection did it cause her immune system was basically dead from all the chemo...I went through some phases. Regret was my first one. Regretting not having a good relationship but therapy made me realize that she was as much at fault for that as I was. Back in that time I still identified as lesbian and she was not okay with it. I was a straight A student never slept anywhere other than home and was pretty quiet but yet I still got yelled at for not opening up to either of them... Thing is my mother wouldnt tell me anything either cause I was always a child to her. Even in my late teens. Dad carried on that mentality literally laughing at the things I wanted to do with my life. But that was par for the course when mom was alive too... Didnt matter what my interests were I had to do something that made lots of money cause I was smart. My mother said not going to university is wasting your brains... I effing HATED school!!!So anyways after a while I have gone to a place where I do actually kind of am mad. Hate is a strong word that I try not to use very often when I write things out as I think theres enough of it in the world and not much I can actually say I hate. Dislike greatly yes hate no. So I dont hate her but I am mad at both my parents for the way they belittled me and stifled my inquisitive mind. Unfortunately I cant go back and neither can they. I am sad sometimes that I didnt have the opportunity to enjoy my mother nor really get to know her. She never called me except once. My dad was away and she was feeling shitty. I lived in the city and she called to say that... I offered to go keep her company but she said not to worry about it. Maybe  months later she was in the hospital getting a scan surgery  days later and well I didnt visit much cause even though we werent close I knew that even if she survived shed never work again and my mom loved her job. She was a nurse. She enjoyed helping people but not me. She NEVER took care of me. The one time I had to leave school cause I had a migraine it was dad that picked me up...So I mean its normal to feel some resentment. Theres nothing wrong with that. Just dont let it fester. Try and deal with it so you can get to a positive place as in be sad for your mother being gone but realize that to you shes just someone who you werent close with. Thats all. I hope all this blabbing kinda helped lol!! Feel free to ask me anything as I think Im well placed to understand where youre coming from. ,ftm,coiqf19,2,t5_2t9mw

3144569,0,t3_2w60r6,I havent done LARPing although it seems AWESOME. But I know three trans guys whove dressed up in drag just for the hell of it. I think once you get more comfortable with yourself either simply by just knowing who you are or by transitioning its easier to do that kind of thing because you know it doesnt influence your masculinity.Like honestly I have always HATED wearing makeup dresses skirts etc. Actually Ive never worn makeup before. But two of my good friends are cis females and they love drag queens and stuff like that and one of them said they want to be a drag king and I was like And I can be your drag queen! like the idea of that seems like a fun kind of thing to do.Its all about your comfort level. The thing to remember is that theyre gendering you as female because you look female. Not because you are female or because you dont pass but you are actively portraying a character who is female. Youre trying to look female so thats nothing at all to do with your gender its just you being that character.,ftm,conxjse,1,t5_2t9mw

If you want to grab a meal together or anything let me know!Male dominated spaces... I always just kinda winged it. I used to be selfconscious about retaining some feminine behaviors which were painfully obvious to me when surrounded by mostly guys but nothing I diddo was really out of the ordinary in most of the groups I spend time around. Since PAX is really a space for people who want to geek out around other people I think itll be pretty chill in that respect not like say a professional setting. Since youre meeting all new people you can go between groups if you start to feel out of place and get a feel for how you feel comfortable.PreT I got by with neutraltomasculine clothes and some work not sure how successful this was on training myself to drop some feminine mannerisms from my speech  speak from the chest  etc. If you introduce yourself with a male name I feel a lot of people just dont bother to question it and if youre in a group where some people are treating you as male other people will pick it up.Have you looked at the schedule yet?

3332221,0,t3_2y9nlg,I would say no in all three. You dont look particularly female but you dont look male or the earlytrans yearold boy look either. You mileage may vary but I personally find the face jewelry to be a feminine trait especially the small silver nose ring. That gave me an immediate female read even if men do sometimes wear nose rings.Your eyebrows eyes and lips all read as feminine to me. If you do anything to shape your eyebrows Id stop. I might even take a dry mascara brush and brush them sort of up to make them look thickerbushier. But dont darken them with make up or anything.  If youre not already shaving your face you may want to. Women tend to have soft peachfuzz on their cheeksface that obviously a man who shaves would have shaved off. Its a very subtle cue.

3340916,0,t1_cp8yph0,Ive participated in studies about that but I havent seen anything published yet. Based on the questions Ive responded to I think the major speculation would be that were more likely to have children with intersex conditions but Ive actually never heard from a male gestational parent that thats happened so its very much speculation.Honestly lactation consultants toxicologists and doctors we talked to thought there would be no way I could continue to breastfeed while taking testosterone. The concerns were that testosterone would suppress milk supply down to nothing and that testosterone would be present in the milk composition. At least with a subcutaneous delivery method both ended up being false. My son has continued to breastfeed Ive been back on T for almost  months and at a full dose and everything has been great his pediatricians and my doctors are monitoring us too.Lots of us have babies!

But there was also some I feel a bit more normal physical relief from it.The pressing dysphoria in my existence is that I have phantom sensations and overpresent sensations in chest and genital regions. This only involves concepts of sexgender because society says it does also a good candidate for explaining why there is so much bias against treating us. If you want to dig into neuroscience there is comparison of trans dysphoria to xenomelia. V.S. Ramachandran and some of his students have done some early studies on trans men and phantom sensations. I was really relieved to find this information as it assured me that there was some beginning to explaining what I have been experiencing all these years.

I literally couldnt physically make it because she was so heavy and I was so out of shape and we were offered a ride by a very nice nearbyish neighbor who was out mowing his lawn at the time. I accepted and never heard the end of why I brought essentially a stranger into her liferisked her lifehow reckless stupid and etc it was to do that.He once smashed my laptop on a hardwood floor  times in a row and spit in my face because I shared a picture of Maia with someone he didnt know online  a person who was a Facebook friend and still is and the interaction with pictures only took place there.He doesnt take new people very well.

Have you worked through your trauma?Yes and no. The sexual abuse part Ive mostly come to terms with. I dont like talking about it and I dont like people knowing hence why only my SO and the therapist I seen to get on T know. There is still some residue effects of the abuse sometimes sex gives me so much anxiety that I just go nonverbalI cant handle sticky substances. My parent situation not so much. I still mourn for the family I should have had if my parents werent so abusive. Its hard to work through this though because of how my SOs family situation is.Are you still trans?Yup! And Ill tell you something my therapist told me. Many people go through the same thing as you but they dont come out trans. Trans isnt something that is a side effect its something you were born as. Abuse or not there was always going to be that feeling because of the way you were born. Paraphrasing of course.Do you know anyone who went through something similar?Not in real life but I know there are a few people on this subreddits who went through something similar.Do you have any resources or reading material?Unfortunately not. But if you have any questions feel free to ask them.Also I first heard the term trans when I was  and shoved it to the back of my head. Id not experience much sex Dysphoria growing up probably because of the abuse apart from frequent phantom penis but I didnt have a word for that at . But when I had the term explained to me it just made so much sense. Thats how I felt. Dysphoria can manifest in many different ways and my main one was dissociation. So whilst I wasnt actively wanting my boobs gone or a penis when I was growing up I never viewed my body as my own. It was as if I was playing a FPS.But after I came to terms with the sexual abuse I could finally admit that I was trans albeit a few years after dealing with it.

Its true that everyone heals differently however have seen many arm and thigh scars in person that are very discrete including my own surgery scar. Many of the photos readily available online are of very recent scars. The aftercare following a phallo is important such as compression garments in order to favor healing and there is a noticeable difference even within a few months of surgery.Although I am certain you had no ill intention I would avoid talking about surgery results as bad you are talking about real peoples bodies.

You and everyone in the world are just falling. You dont know where you are going and you cant fly back up and you dont know when you will reach the bottom of this fall.Now imagine you meet someone amazing during this fall. This person is perfect but you say to yourself I cant be with this person. If I attach myself to this person I will drag them down with me. I will cause them pain and I will quicken their descent and cause nothing but suffering. But you need to realize that isnt true.Everyone feels pain and joy and fear and the whole spectrum of human emotions. This person will too if not from you from somebody else. And if this person enjoys you if this person wants to fall holding your hand why dont you want that? Why dont you want to share the pain and the joy and everything else with someone you love? Youre both going to come to the bottom sometime why not let them do it with someone they love?I guess the point is life is too short to feel afraid and inadequate. You have to take risks and you have to believe that people can decide whats best for them and then you have to trust them if they say you are whats best for them. I mean Im not an expert and neither is the guy who said this to me but I just wanted to spread some somewhat depressing words of encouragement that helped me.TL DR Everyone feels pain and most of it will have nothing to do with you so you should give her your number because yolo I guess I am terrible at summarizing.,ftm,cpxmfqe,8,t5_2t9mw

3623497,0,t3_31v6gc,If you tuck in the shirt and wear a vest it will look like a normal mens shirt. That collar is pretty masculine. If you wear a binder under it you can have a tailor take in the darts the lines in front that end mid boob so the shirt lies flatter against your chest. For sizing in the future look in boys sections or go to stores that cater to smallerthinner men. So places like Uniqlo or HampM or Express. Basically the asian and European brands. For shirts always look for slim or skinny cuts as theyre more likely to fit your torsoshoulders and if the arms are loose thats a pretty simple tailoring job. For pants again boys sizes or find some that fit your waisthips and hem them to the proper length. Some stores like Uniqlo offer free hemming for their pants. But hemming is actually super easy and you can do it yourself. If the pants fit everywhere except billow around your calves you can have them tapered also a pretty simple tailoring job. ,ftm,cq5b08n,3,t5_2t9mw

I also think its nice to have a male trans model out there. Perhaps there are others but Ive never heard of them. Im happy to celebrate when company x hires their first trans female model and I think it would be glorious to see a trans male model on the cover of a magazine. Regarding glamour versus suicidemurderviolence I think its important to report both. While there could be more done to spread the word about trans deaths and other depressing topics its pretty fab to have positive stories out there too. I came out to a new employer last year after my utter lack of passing led her to assume I was a woman. Shed never met a trans person before and neither had her husband so they went home and did some googling. Bless them both they then sat me down and wanted to know how I was being looked after if I had access to resources and wanted to know what they could do to help because they couldnt find any happy stories about trans men and were convinced that my trans status meant I was going to kill myself. I believe I managed to assure them that Im stable and in a good place but I think it would benefit both us trans folk and our allies if there were more positive stories out there.,ftm,cqg0ax7,7,t5_2t9mw

Hes a very thin guy but  percent looks like a guy without a doubt and is VERY attractive imo and thousands of others lol.

3769566,0,t1_cqlwu3f,gtIn particular this is sexism at work.Yup.gtIts not a perk of being a woman.Yes yes it is. Do you pass as male? Personally I noticed the way police began to treat me differently right away. I was never even stopped by the police as a woman and as a woman I was genuinely a criminal. Now I am upstanding member of society but I am seen as a threat in a way I never was before. Yes this is sexism but the assumption of innocence is definitely a perk of being a woman. I went from rich to poor which might be a factor admittedly this happened when I was still presenting female but I still dress the same way and carry myself the same way just the male version of the style I used to wear.Think of it this way. Which would you rather happen. Would you rather be patronized by the police and let go with a warning or would you rather get the shit beaten out of you and then get charged with resisting arrest or for damaging police property because you bled on their uniforms? gt Just because it sometimes works out in your favor doesnt mean its not a way in which women are treated as lesser than men.I think you are failing to understand what I am trying to say. gtJust because occasionally women find themselves in situations where they accrue some benefit a man wouldnt doesnt magically mean that a male privilege doesnt exist and b our society systematically advantages men over women.I didnt say male privilege doesnt exist I am just saying that females are also privileged for being female. I am also saying that all privileges experienced by members of the peasant class also come with disadvantages attached to them. This is done so that they cannot explain their grievances to one another without fostering envy. gtThink about white privilege. Sometimes its mildly inconvenient to be white. Every white person in Chicago probably has a story about people thinking they must be lost while on public transport heading south. That isnt really a disadvantage I associate with being white. A disadvantage I associate with being white is the idea that you are a member of a high caste no matter what your actual status in society is. As you can imagine this is also a privilege. This means if you are genuinely in need of help or welfare or if you are a child being abused by your parents people just dont believe youre actually in need of help because they see you as a member of a high caste. If you complain about your life situation youre just a white person complaining. In my county for example poor whites are often resentful of Latinos for taking the welfare services they need. Is this really happening? No. What is really happening is that where I live Latin people are seen as a lower caste and theyre just the type of people who need welfare so agents spend more time helping them. You have probably seen white people on television complaining about this and dismissed it as racist. Well it is racist but it is also an example of how a peasant class can be effectively divided using privilege. I imagine poor whites experience much less police harassment than poor Latinos because of this assumption of a high caste status. If not for these divisions the poor Latino and poor white communities might organize themselves in order to help one another gather resources. They might protest using civil disobedience or find a way to make some kind of change in their situation. ,ftm,cqlyhy4,0,t5_2t9mw

3776353,0,t1_cqm588h,Deducting medical expenses is pretty much only going to be possible and worthwhile in a year when you had surgery which isnt covered by insurance.  You can only deduct if your medical expenses exceed  of your income.  And the amount that you get via itemizing deductions might or might not be more than the standard deduction.  From my superrough napkinmath estimates if you have a relatively standard income the standard deduction will be better for you every year except a year with an expensive noncovered surgery.  ,ftm,cqmqd76,1,t5_2t9mw

The fact is that people suck and they have just as much of an obligation to improve themselves as any of us do. Its on them.I think for you OP you need to look to your future and make coming out to potentially unsupportive family your secondary goal.Based on your flair youre interested in going on T but havent yet right? Maybe we should talk through a list of things youre interested in working on and visually put dealing with mom in order of priority on that list. I find that working on transition goals has always given me a big sense of accomplishment and that each step on my journey diminished some of the stress I had about how things would go when my mom finally got clued in.Youre entitled to agency but sometimes we have to work to feel like weve earned our independence. If you dont feel this way already you can get to where youll genuinely think your mom was not entitled to any kind of consultation about your transition. Coming out to family is supposed to be about usabout widening our support networks. If youre not going to get support from her why go through the coming out now?It also helps in some cases to wait if you ARE going on T because you get that my somewhat unsupportive family is coming around faster benefit due to the seeing is believing factor that comes with the physical masculinization from T. Ive gotten all manner of disrespectful comments when I was preT and then again off T but as the same person I was then Im treated with all due respect and basic human dignity just because I look more male on T to them.,ftm,crkjpq2,3,t5_2t9mw

I think I tend to prefer people who arent white dont know a good way to say that in my partners at least in terms of my dating history and I like to be with men who are much more muscular than I am.

4217569,0,t1_cs0uutw,Okay well let me say this then dentists do NOT use intravenous general anesthesia. So youre probably looking at Nitrous Oxide as an inhalant. The other options would be the following Isoflurane Forane Desflurane Suprane or Secoflurane Ultane. General anesthesia is given intravenously or inhaled through a breathing mask and sometimes both methods are used. Sedation may also be given before the patient is taken into the operating room. See more at So maybe tell your anesthesiologist that you dont want to risk an inhalant since youre unsure if youll have a reaction or not to it. And the drugs used intravenously are not the same. And heres some more web stuff!Types of anesthetic agentsThere are two major types of anesthetics used for general anesthesia inhalation and intravenous anesthetics. Inhalation anesthetics which are sometimes called volatile anesthetics are compounds that enter the body through the lungs and are carried by the blood to body tissues. Inhalation anesthetics are less often used alone in recent clinical practice they are usually used together with intravenous anesthetics. A combination of inhalation and intravenous anesthetics often with opioids added for pain relief and neuromuscular blockers for muscle paralysis is called balanced anesthesia.INHALATION ANESTHETICS. The following are the most commonly used inhalation anestheticsHalothane causes unconsciousness but provides little pain relief often administered with analgesics . It may be toxic to the liver in adults. Halothane however has a pleasant smell and is therefore often the anesthetic of choice when mask induction is used with children.Enflurane is less potent but produces a rapid onset of anesthesia and possibly a faster recovery. Enflurane is not used in patients with kidney failure.Isoflurane is not toxic to the liver but can induce irregular heart rhythms.Nitrous oxide laughing gas is used with other such drugs as thiopental to produce surgical anesthesia. It has the fastest induction and recovery time. It is regarded as the safest inhalation anesthetic because it does not slow respiration or blood flow to the brain. However because nitrous oxide is a relatively weak anesthetic it is not suited for use in major surgery. Although it may be used alone for dental anesthesia it should not be used as a primary agent in more extensive procedures.Sevoflurane works quickly and can be administered through a mask since it does not irritate the airway. On the other hand one of the breakdown products of sevoflurane can cause renal damage.Desflurane a secondgeneration version of isoflurane is irritating to the airway and therefore cannot be used for mask inhalation inductions especially not in children. Desflurane causes an increase in heart rate and so should be avoided for patients with heart problems. Its advantage is that it provides a rapid awakening with few adverse effects.INTRAVENOUS ANESTHETICS. Commonly administered intravenous general anesthetics include ketamine thiopental a barbiturate methohexital Brevital etomidate and propofol Diprivan. Ketamine produces a different set of reactions from other intravenous anesthetics. It resembles phencyclidine which is a street drug that may cause hallucinations. Because patients who have been anesthetized with ketamine often have sensory illusions and vivid dreams during postoperative recovery ketamine is not often given to adult patients. It is however useful in anesthetizing children patients in shock and trauma casualties in war zones where anesthesia equipment may be difficult to obtain.General anesthesia in dental proceduresThe use of general anesthesia in dental and oral surgery patients differs from its use in major surgery because the patients level of fear is usually a more important factor than the nature of the procedure. In  an NIH Consensus Statement reported that high levels of preoperative anxiety lengthy and complex procedures and the need for a painfree operative period may be indications for general anesthesia in healthy adults and very young children. The NIH statement specified that at least three professionals are required when general anesthesia is used during dental procedures one is the operating dentist the second is a professional responsible for observing and monitoring the patient the third person assists the operating dentist.Although the United States allows general anesthesia for dental procedures to be administered outside hospitals provided that the facility has the appropriate equipment and emergency drugs Scotland banned the use of general anesthesia outside hospitals in  after a tenyearold boy died during a procedure to have a tooth removed.Read more ,ftm,cs0zieo,1,t5_2t9mw

Ive found as Ive taken every step in my physical transition that my dysphoria has lessened but my dysmorphia has increased. Or perhaps become more apparent.I never used to care about my belly fat or my posture. I didnt feel self conscious about my body in that way because I was SO consumed by feeling a total lack of congruency between my mind and body in terms of my gender.Now I am more focused on changing things about my body that arent related to gender. I do have this distinct image of myself in my minds eye. I will never truly be that image because I am shorter than that man I have bigger hips and my head is too small. But I am starting to look more like him or perhaps its that the image of him is changing to look more like me.I am motivated to do the things within my power to try to match the image of him too. Not as much as I could be and over the last two years its been difficult due to surgery recoveries and complications but I feel as if I still have work to do to feel like I am me.I do feel like the body issues I have now are less of a trans issue and more of a human issue.

4343894,0,t1_csewuxh,. I talked a bit about meta vs. phallo up above. As far as how I settled on bottom surgery in general its hard to pinpoint exactly what happened but at some point it suddenly jumped into the foreground and became very important for me. I needed something down there that felt more like my own more like something I could connect to and meta seemed like the best option to help me achieve that.. I did consider other surgeons but only briefly. I preferred not to leave the country for the procedure and Dr. Crane had the results that best reflected what I hoped my own would look like. I seem to remember that he was also one of the only or maybe the only surgeon who closed up the vagina completely for vaginectomy and that was important to me. . It sounds like a month or so out is when things really start getting back to normal. Im  days out and feel significantly better but am nowhere near ready to resume regular activity. I am set to return to work on July  and am nervous about it but hopeful I will be ready by then. Ill try to remember to come back and answer this later since I mostly just dont know at this point!. I wish I had a good answer but I havent really noticed since everything is all bandaged up and healing. I think itll take some getting used to but overall Im excited. Ill have to decide if I want to come back for implants which would make the sac appear larger and more typically masculine. I probably will but right now thinking about another surgery is overwhelming! Ill try to remember to add to this once Im further along in my healing as well. ,ftm,csfadmc,3,t5_2t9mw
4346344,0,t3_3asbh5,I would definitely be sure to have somebody you can trustrely on before you actually start hormones.  That way when your mother does all that you can have somebody to fall back on therefore what she does will have slightly less of an impact.In terms of boarding school Im not actually sure how that works being in public school  however if its anything like high schoolcollege then you shouldnt have to stress about getting kicked out of it.  You should be able to go back later in life when youre more able.Loosing the money would suck yes but you could always start saving upworkingetc.  Loosing money isnt the end of the world it might severely put you back but not ruin your life.Just try to think of things in the long run.

I dont know if Ill ever be able to work through it entirely although I can catch myself when Im doing it and try to break the habit.

4521422,0,t3_3cz8zj,It seems like theres two separate issues here the gender stuff and the childhood stuff. In regard to the childhood stuff its not disrespectful for your parents to remind you that you were a baby once. You were. Yeah I get that it can be annoying to have them ask you if you remember things that happened before you were old enough to retain those memories but what theyre really asking is Do you remember when this thing happened? We all ask that question to people multiple times a day. And honestly at  you probably arent an adult in their eyes. I know a lot of folks around your age Im  and work a job that tends to have more younger folks and while theyre rad folks and pretty responsible and reliable I have to remind myself when I find myself being frustrated with them that only five years ago they were in high school while I was working and paying bills and shit and these are people that I DIDNT know since they were young enough to poop themselves. Likewise my sister will be  this year and while I now see her as a fully capable driven adult and an amazing mom shes also still my little sister that lied about eating cookies with a mouth full of half chewed cookie. Family memory runs long and its extremely frustrating as a young adult trying to become somebody but its not necessarily a bad thing. I want you to take a look at the wording of your last sentence you use the word force twice in regards to respect. You cannot force someone to respect you period. You can force someone to listen to you or to obey you but never to respect you. The only way to get someones respect is to continuously display the kind of actions that they find respectable. You mentioned somewhere in this thread that youre concerned about your rage issues Im willing to bet that if they saw you taking steps to manage your rage and take responsibility for your responses that theyll start seeing you as the adult you wish to be seen as. Even in a situation where a conflict arises between you and your parents where youre the kid and clearly at a disadvantage it does a lot more to step back and say I dont like the way this conversation is going Im going to step away cool off and collect myself and we can pick this back up when Im feeling ready to tackle it again than to fly off the handle. I used to have some shit rage problems when I was around your age Ive broken many cell phones and even my car windshield once. It sucks its embarrassing and humbling and its painful and isolating. I feel you bro. To a certain degree my dad still doesnt see me as a legit adult but at least now its because I understand that hes judging me by the limits of his own competence and imagination. And fuck me did that take time to understand. You absolutely WILL get there. Find a way to improve yourself every day even just an inch. Your parents will notice the change it just might take a little longer than you want them to. edit realized I mentioned gender stuff early on though it wasnt in OPs initial post. I read comment replies before responding and it came out there and was in my head while I was responding. Sorry for any confusion.,ftm,ct0ke6e,0,t5_2t9mw
4523437,0,t3_3cz8zj,Speaking as sa parent myself they might be getting sentimental about the past because youre now an adult and they feel like theyre losing you. Maybe reassuring them of your continued love amp respect will help them let go of the past.,ftm,ct0thlg,2,t5_2t9mw

Being of a hypochondriacal nature since childhood one of the reasons I delayed t for so long was my dad saying that t was poison and caused reproductive cancer recurrent urinary tract infections and vaginal yeast infections.

4538144,0,t1_ct28wwl,I used to use two black tritops all the time it was the only way I could keep things secure during jobs that involved a lot of bending over where everything would gradually roll to the center and bulge. This lasted about two years before it fucked up my spine and I had to give it up for a single white one. Now I use a single white for Tshirts but can get away with only one of the old black ones for button downs. And this still requires having to periodically slink off to a corner and reach in there to push them back out of the center but I dont think a binder exists that can prevent that.,ftm,ct2nwdf,1,t5_2t9mw

Dont judge your chest status by looking down only by looking straight on in a mirror even looking at it from the side is iffy because cismen have chests too so even if there is bulk if it is flattened you could totally just have a barrel chest look going on.

4630955,0,t3_3ecv31,I recently started with a new psych and counselor. They were both super professional and never really gave me the thirddegree. My original treatment goal was to start a regular routine with my antidepressants I have depression only semirelated to my dysphoria and find a balance that worked. Second step was to get out of my transphobic and homophobic verbally and emotionally abusive home. I was fortunate enough to receive a lot of help and knock those goals out. The current goal theyre having me work on is coming out to everyone Im out to my closest friends and my fiance and thats all. After that well start working on the actual physical transition. I experience moderatetosevere dysphoria. My best advice is to just be completely honest otherwise youll get very little out of your therapy.

A psychiatrists chart notes hold more clout than a therapist and they will work with a therapists to make sure youre moving along the direction you wish you pursue. It seems the clinic you are going to has a psychiatrist who is listed as specializing in Transgender Services. If the clinic is anything like the AHCCCS clinics here in Tucson your first behavior health appointment will be an intake appointment. They will assign you a case manager whom you must see once a month a psychiatrist this where Id advise you request one that specializes in the services youre seeking and a therapist also ask for one who specializes in transgender therapy.

4646911,0,t1_ctgaf3d,I personally disagree with your statements. I am a trans gender guy. I like the way but body looks as well but not as my own. Id do anything for a male body. I dont exactly feel male or female but I am more comfortable presenting as male. My female body is really attractive to me. I have a tiny waist and large bust and as much as I hate it as my own its a damn good body to look at. uCJMack dont let people tell you they think you are or are not trans. I didnt have dysphoria as a kid for example. I was just jealous I couldnt pee standing up or be shirtless. I like looking pretty and beautiful but the more masculine I present the better I feel. I identify as a Trans genderqueer guy or even as a trans crossdressing guy. Seeing myself in the furure as a female is almost like seeing a character that doesnt look like me. Seeing myself as male has been a huge relief and after I realized I may be trans which had been in my mind for years as the curiosity of having a penis and jealousy of the male form did I have dysphoria. Its your journey and dont let people tell you that you have to feel or think a certain way to be trans. No disrespect uTheOneAndOnlyTainted but I personally think your comment is a little I dont know brash?

4660505,0,t3_3eslus,Wearing a binder for  hours is probably a bad idea but there are a few options. I would not say that GCB or Underworks are options unless you can take the binder off for  minutes a few times during the day.Depending on how big your chest is you might be able to get away with a sports bra. If theres less than a five inch difference between the measurement around your underbust ribcage and bust chest its a lot easier. Not including cup sizes because a five inch difference could be variously an A a C or a DD cup. Anyway I get pretty good results with a highcompression sports bra  size too small and I have pretty big breasts and a pretty small ribcage  ribcage and  chest. A sports bra is less likely to hurt you than a binder when you wear it for  hours but listen to your body and if it hurts take it off. You do not want to end up in the emergency department because you used your binder or sports bra wrong.Hint I kind of pull my breasts out towards the arm holes so they look more like pecs. I wear this out of stock Old Navy one and I got an XS while I would generally buy an S or maybe M. You definitely dont have to get that exact one but Id try on a few different ones in different sizes to see which ones compress while not hurting. They tend to go on sale so if the seams wear out its not too big of a deal.Another option if sports bras dont work is a binder with a zipper velcro or hookandeye closure. Lesloveboat though the name is offputting has some that seem to be wellreceived. It does depend on your budget theyre expensive. The benefit to that is that you can go into a bathroom stall take it off cough a few times to get builtup mucus out and chill for at least five minutes. They arent always as safe as Underworks or GCB but if you listen to your body and wear the correct size you should be fine.And if you have a small chest you might not even need to bind just wear layers. If you pass in other ways then a slight bump wont throw people off too much.Oh and some bonus tips about binding in general dont use those  eBay binders which are unsafe and for the love of God do not even look at an Ace bandage or tape. Those things can severely injure you.Good luck!Edit Im seconding utaylorinprogress on the looser regular binder idea. But like always listen to your body.,ftm,cti0hj1,2,t5_2t9mw

4689207,0,t3_3f46lb,Hey.I just wanted to say something from the experience of a kid who went through similar issues. It may not mean anything to you. It may help may not. But I think that the point of view of the child in this situation is extremely important. Precursor I cant claim to know how your daughter will feel or react. This is my experiences. When I was a baby my mother was . My father was barely . I was the outcome of one wild night of partying. Because of their ages my parents didnt feel they could properly care for me  no jobs no world experience so I went to live with my maternal grandparents. I grew up around them until I was about . I didnt know my mother was in fact my mother. I just thought she was another one of my cousins visiting. I have a lot of cousins. I was happy with my grandparents. They treated me well. My mother decided she wanted to be a mom after a while. So she got a goodish job. My parents were still together dating. They both had a place. Jobs. So they took me. It was an awful experience because no matter how much I care about my mother she will never be my mom. She was not there to care for me when I was younger. I know that isnt her fault and I dont BLAME her for that. I blame her for not going slowly and allowing ME to do what felt right. That said Im so glad youre willing to respect your daughter even if it hurts. It took me a long time to regain any trust when it came to my mother and if I had dictated the speed of the relationship that would have been easier. Letting her decide and feel out the relationship is honestly what will give you the best chances of being a good Dad in the future. It may take time but itll get there eventually. ,ftm,ctlm9ad,2,t5_2t9mw

Im worried I will do that because I cant my other half and I are good friends with them and if I disappeared he would just be interrogated about it. Wouldnt be too hard just a bit tricky for him and I dont want to affect his friendship with them he has more in common with them than I do. Yeah I am worried about randomers that I use to know from schoolcollege etc just the gossiping and feeling that uncomfortableness. I know I shouldnt care what they think but I do even people I actively dislike Im scared of what they would think. I know its a shit way to live but its what Ive always done anyway Ive just never had anything as big that Id like to do. Thats nice to hear thank you. I think its because I want them to know but Im just so scared of rejection its the kind of fear where it doesnt even seem like a choice because coming out would put me out on the line and vulnerable to others. And Im a pretty sensitive person. I dont think I could deal with it. So Im being a woss and complaining about it on here... S urgh I hope so! One friend has been supported and I know another would be Im just worried they would be the only ones I have. Its awesome that you had friends you knew would accept you  I feel like my friends could but they would always make comments its how it is it probably isnt a very healthy friendship group. Plus one can be openly a dick to me just because dont even know. I also use to be seen as someone who they could potential have sex with now I know I wont be. I guess I havent been for a while but that would be a definitely no no. Which I dont care about but I dont think very highly of them and I think it would be an issue. Plus they also see the me as the feminist so I feel like I will get judged for changing from that plus they dont agree with feminism because they have the shit idea of it that everyone chooses to have so I feel like they will see it as worse. Not to mention whenever anyone says any joke that is sexist they expect a response from me and I dont care enough to give it anymore.After writing all of this Im starting to feel that they arent my kind of people but that doesnt mean I dont need them. I need to socialize with others Im not that close with them anymore more about having a joke but its nice to have that even if they arent  my type of people.

4777053,0,t3_3gaybm,I wasnt gonna log in but I had to after reading your post. Last year I was almost in the exact same spot that you were. I was  pounds and finally getting somewhat comfortable with my body but also face to face with my own mortality because I had developed a nonalcoholic fatty liver at the age of . Im also only an inch shorter than you so even more to relate to. It was an accident that finally got me my wakeup call. I had to bend over and I threw out my back trying to get back up. I barely made it to my bed to collapse. I couldnt help it I cried hard. Not from the pain and there was a lot of pain but from all the anger and frustration I was feeling. My gut had gotten so big that my back muscles could no longer support it. I couldnt believe I let it get to this. I knew something had to change and that something was me. Like all my big decisions in my life I made the impulse decision to finally get my shit together and lose all this excess weight.On August   day of the accident I weighed about  pounds. Today August   I weight  pounds. Its a drastic weight loss but its absolutely doable without going to extremes. It seems other people have covered food and exercise so Ill cover what was my own biggest challenge beverages.Beverages are one of the easiest ways that we get unneeded calories into our bodies. If you drink any sodas coffee with cream andor sugar energy drinks alcohol juice ect time to make changes. You need to cut out a lot of that stuff and replace some others. If you love soda switch to diet. If youre sensitive to the taste of the artificial sugar like I am drink them as cold as possible. Cold numbs your taste buds and makes the aspartame flavor less noticeable. Its an acquired taste and youll get use to it after a couple weeks or days if you drink it as often as I do. The same applies for energy drinks which are essentially sodas with added caffeine and a bunch of other stimulants. Go with zero calorie. Its better for you than the regular stuff with all the sugar. Stop drinking fruit juice. The amount of nutrients doesnt counteract the amount of sugar and calories you get in as well. If you want fruit eat it. You need the fiber anyway which you really dont get from commercial juices. Try drinking unsweetened tea. Its good for you and has no calories. If you absolutely need that sweetness dont worry my sweet tooth knows no bounds either go for artificial sweetener. Experiment and see what you like. Personally I like monk fruit sweetener. It tastes good without giving me the runs. With coffee start taking black if you can. If not dont blame you switch the cream and sugar to something lower calorie. Silk makes almond and soy creamer that taste fantastic. Theyre also already sweetened so no need for additional sugar! Do you get any of the coffee dessert drinks like frapuchinos from Starbucks? Sorry but youre gonna have to cut those out for a while. Its nothing more than added calories youre better off saving up for a meal thatll leave you satisfied. If you drink alcohol cut it out for now. Going through a drastic lifestyle change can leave you vulnerable to toxic coping mechanisms like substance abuse and addiction. Besides alcohol is really calorie dense. Example heres a calorie count of some of the most popular American beer brands. Considering that the recommended daily average is  calories and even less if youre not an active person thats a crapton of empty calories.Speaking of recommended calorie counts and stuff you need to figure out your TDEE and your BMR. BMR is your basal metabolic rate and TDEE is your total daily energy expenditure. What those mean is the amount of calories you need to just exist and the amount of calories you burn in a day just going about your daily life respectively. You can easily find out what those numbers are for you online. One thing youll notice that might come as a shock is that because of your weight your metabolic hate is actually higher than the average person. Thats because your body uses a lot of calories to maintain your weight. The point of finding these out is to help you realize how many calories you need to consume to be at a calorie deficit and actually start losing weight. You mightve noticed on the website I gave you that on there it asks for your gender. Dont worry about that too much for now but do know that it is important as you get closer to your goal. Male and female bodies burn calories at different rates with male bodies burning more calories than female bodies. Its just biology and how its works. It sucks but it is how it is.Another thing you need to figure out is why you are overweight. Not the physiological aspect because that one can be easy to figure out. I mean the psychological aspect. It can be hard to confront and even harder to deal with but you need to do it to maintain any longterm weight loss and to feel good about yourself. For me I coped with food because I couldnt cope with sobriety. I was a drug addict as a teenager and ended up getting sober for someone I loved. I couldnt deal with sobriety though so I ate. I became a drug addict in the first place because I refused to deal with the cards I was dealt in life. I also did it to hide my body. I was a hot girl with huge breasts which I hated. Drugs made me not feel but after sobriety I figured that my weight would help hide my figure. Nope just made my boobs bigger and made my face more round and feminine. So I ate more to cope with that. When I started to confront and deal with my demons I finally realized what a shitty coping mechanism I had. I started to crave food a hell of a lot less and the weight loss became easier.Speaking of transition and weight this might shock you. Your chances of passing can increase as you lose weight. It happened to me. I use to have DDD breasts. Try imagining binding those successfully while being asthmatic. I cant tell you how many upper respiratory infections I gave myself and how many times I bruised my ribs. I couldve killed myself! I have no idea what size my chest is now since Im living as myself  of the time and dont deal with bras but it cant be bigger than a Dcup. I actually found one of my old bras from middle school the other day and tried it on for the hell of it. My chest was way too small for it! Plus theres the added bonus of them getting really flat due to loss of fat. Theyre so easy to bind now! It also made my face more angular. I went from passing  of the time to about . This is preT and still with an hourglass figure. So if you were struggling with motivation heres some added motivation.Oh wow this got long. Sorry about that! I hope this isnt too much. If it is and seems overwhelming just let me know and Ill cut shit down. Just know that if you stumble thats ok. Lifestyle changes are a learning process and youre expected to make mistakes. Trust me Ive made plenty along the way. Hell I just recently regained  pounds. Rather than beating myself up over it and giving up like I use to though I simply recognize my mistakes and get back on track. If you fall off the wagon you can get back on it.TLDR Dont drink your calories confront your inner demons find new coping mechanisms smaller chest and I ramble a lot.,ftm,ctwotx7,2,t5_2t9mw

4825225,0,t3_3gxqfy,I think the Archer actually looks pretty reasonable. Ive seen a fair number of dudes in bike shorts and only some have a distinctly visible bulge. If it were me Id try packing with a rolled up sock. Youd still get the appearance of having something down there but it would be a bit squishier and less detailed looking. Another alternative is the good old hair gel and condoms packer. I have a friend who performs on the flying trapeze and he was having a super hard time finding a way to pack that didnt look unrealisticexplicit under his tights. He ended up making a packer out of hair gel and condoms and it had just the right amount of bulk to be visible but not conspicuous. Yet another alternative is to get shorts with a more padded crotch.

A you will always be female and you are sick for wanting to transition you only want to transition because patriarchy vibe in all of these blogs. This isnt jarring language or realities of transition that most of the trans community doesnt want to talk about this is just extrans TERF propaganda. gtI dont agree that this sub endorses TERF ideas in general like at all and Im wondering where you get thatDude I see it all the time. It seems like almost every time I visit this sub I end up having an argument with a TERF. Edit Sometimes I end up in an argument with someone who isnt full TERF but who has many radfem beliefs that boarder on gender critical. I also see people who have third wave feminist beliefs that are...transmisandric. Is that a word? Feminists beliefs that seem to exclude trans men specifically but accept trans women.

4942441,0,t3_3ijjk2,Disclaimer I am not a gender dysphoria specialist mental health specialist nor am I a doctor. This is only my personal take on the matter and I strongly recommend you do your own research and decide for yourself  ideally with the aid of a medicaltherapy team. I dont know anything about detransitioning Im afraid! But Ill leave you with my thoughts on the rest of your post and I hope something might be of help.  Im going to second the other person who said that its probably best to stop looking at it like a choice between man and woman but rather think about the physical reality you would feel most comfortable with. How do you feel you would be most comfortable with your body? A few exercises here might help. When you close your eyes and visualise how your ideal version of your own body looks how does it look? Would you feel affirmed or alienated by more body hair and facial hair more muscle a deeper voice a different build no breasts fewer curves? . Stand in front of the mirror naked and pull around your body fat. What sets off that oh thats more like it spark in your head? Is it something that could be achieved through HRT andor surgery thinking realistically? . If you have photoshopdrawing abilities it could also be worth playing around with manipulatingediting photos of yourself. I spent some time drawing sensible ideas of what my body might look like through years of testosterone and surgery using my heightbuildgenetics as a starting point. . Try to imagine yourself in old age. When youre  what do you see your body as looking like? This is an excellent method of identifying what is I would like to be more attractive and what is I need this in order to feel comfortable in my body. . Similar to  imagine your body as a fat ugly and male one. Do you still want it? Will you still love it? Im not saying that medical transition will result in this  not at all  but that its important to root out what is merely wanting to be more attractive. Many women dislike their curves because they wish they were thinner that is quite different to wanting to have a male body and wanting to take testosterone to get it! I think you need to sit down and figure out if its a case of oh I wish I was a guy  that would be really very nice but actually Im okay with living life as I am physically and going I am a guy and if I cant make that a physical reality I dont feel like I can continue living in any meaningful way. If its the former then medical transition could actually cause more distress. Also when you wish you could be a cis guy  why is that? is it the body? the social gender roles? the lack of misogyny? Its imperative that youre brutally honest with yourself here. It may be that you do not wish to medically transition and you are most comfortable with social transition alone  or even no transition if thats where you decide youll be most comfortable. All options are equally as valid for different people so please try to ignore the well X label dictates that X path is the right thing... line of thought. One last note have you looked into nonbinary identities? Again I cant say I personally understand it but I have nonbinary friends who have found their peace through that path. At the end of the day transitioning is merely about finding what brings us the most peace with our bodies. ,ftm,cuhj8iq,3,t5_2t9mw
4955307,0,t1_cuigdgb,gt I never felt scared walking alone at night when I was seen as female genuinely never feared for my safety.. Being seen as male Ill think twice occasionally about walking somewhere though because being seen as equal to some drunk cunt looking for a fight is a lot more dangerous imo than being seen as off limits because I had tits. Thats probably because statistically men are by and far more the victims of crime. Most crime is not man on woman it is man on man crime and even further it is generally by men of the same race i.e. white on white black on black Latino on Latino etc.. Men are by and far more the victims of violent crimes as well robbery battery murder etc.. A man isnt going to hesitate kicking the shit out of another man but they do hesitate when it comes to hitting a woman  even most criminals wont hit women because it is seen as off limits to do. It really sucks because it is one of those issues thats almost never addressed. EDIT Your thing on abuse is spot on. Id also like to note that a lot of men are actually accused of being the abuser automatically if a man IS abused an tries to speak out. A lot of places also ALWAYS arrest someone on a domestic violence claim and it is almost always the man regardless of who started things or who is the aggressor. Men also have WAY less resources as victims  a woman can go to a domestic violence shelter and get help getting back on her feet whereas a man will generally be shunted off to a homeless shelter and not given jack or shit. Men also are disgustingly often told that they cant be the victim of DVabuse and that they must have done something for their partner to beat the shit out of them.,ftm,cuj5njh,2,t5_2t9mw

Here is how I have handled thingsFacebook  I had actually deleted my account for other unrelated reasons.  Recently a year or so later I created a new one with my new name and just sent new friend requests without any explanation.  So I am not a lot of help on this one.For work I told everyone and they took care of updating all the necessary items except legal things email and the like.  Then the old me just stopped coming to work one day.For doctors I waited for my next appointment and told them once I was in the treatment room alone and they all put a note on my charts.  So all the billing is accurate but they call me by my proper name.I havent been to the dentist yet so my plan if my name is changed by my next appt legally is to tell them about the name change when I make the appointment.  My name is ltnew namegt but you will have my records under my old name ltold namegt I need to update that as well.The random acquaintances from the neighborhood I just tell them I go by James now and let them assume whatever they want.  Repair services and the like I dont plan to say anything to until I have a legal change but I will do the same. In general my new name is usually plenty of information and tends to automatically get me the proper pronouns the next time I am there.I like to take advantage of any phone interaction that naturally happens to take care of informing people before i see them in person.

5137584,0,t1_cv56yix,Oh my god. Your response has helped so much just from reading it. I was so scared that I was being selfish and controlling but I was also pretty set in my way because I feel that it is something that we wouldnt survive through and I wouldnt either. Last year was hell. And although I was on that side where I ignored him and got annoyed at him for being clingly i regret it soo bad. It was just a result of peer pressure I was so busy and I never felt safe or welcome. And Im scared it would do it to me. I know its hypocritical but I think it could also be a way to learn from past experience. We both suffered as a mixture of both of us and things we couldnt control. I guess I still see uni from the perspective of the type of person who wants to get wasted every night and leave assignments to the extreme last minute and who wants to meet everyone all of the time. I tried to join in on that and I tried to be someone Im not for so long and it fucked with me so bad I had a breakdown and came home one night and didnt return to my halls other than to collect my things a couple of months later during that time I went into a weird zoned out space where I couldnt associate with reality well and had major anxiety I also started cutting myself again. So I guess it makes sense for me to really rather against halls. And scared of them. Anyway dont want him to get dragged into that I know he doesnt like going out drinking much and doesnt like clubbing. Plus next year we can easily get a place near his uni together and maybe with others if he meets people so its better for him then for his undergraduate degree while I dont mind commuting a little bit still. Or we could both stay up there in different houses but close. Im so sorry that was the situation with you. I always assumed that to manage at uni you had to deal with long distance with your other half and you had to be lenient on cheating etc. I guess some people who are less serious can do that but I knew it wasnt me. But I tried so fucking hard. Ive never been so untrue to myself ever.It sounds pretty horrible. But Im so happy you replied. I see how much you reply to people on here and I think its amazing how you do it and always manage to relate to people! Thanks for the book. ,ftm,cv59rat,1,t5_2t9mw

Its such a personal topic one that you have no obligation to share with anyone who isnt close to you. If people knowing your personal history makes you uncomfortable and you think that moving will help and you can afford the adjustment you should consider it. Travel go see the world and shit.

My friends all complain about the pain of IM and the needle scarring and I havent experienced this with subq. Sometimes there is the tiniest of pinches when putting the needle into my stomach but it hurts less than say a routine blood drawing. Often I can get it angled to go in with no pain. I dont know if its faster at all because everyone changes at different paces and your genetics determine how quickly different things change to begin with.My doctor didnt teach me to pull skin away to form a pocket like some others said but he showed me to pinch a piece of skin hard enough to hurt so my brain would focus on the pain of the pinching and I would feel less pain from the injection. I think it helps!Also I dont get scarring at all.

It sounds like the path to healthy and constructive communication with your father has been a hard road and isnt going to get easier anytime soon.I think that whether you do want to maintain distance between you and your father or whether you want to work at your relationship over time both of those things could work. With some people it takes a lot of time to improve the problems in your relationship and some of the improvement comes in the form of getting to where the problems are still there but dont hit YOU as hard ie its not fixed but the amount I have to care about it is much less.And if visiting home is not ideal you should try to have lunch dates with your mom and things like that to help her feel less isolated.,ftm,cvrwvy8,2,t5_2t9mw

Do you want to tell them because you dont want to be misgendered? or do you feel like you owe them an explanation? because you really dont. I mean you cant expect them to magically switch pronouns but you dont have to tell them if you dont want togtEventually theyre bound to notice my transition.Actually youd be really surprised what people are willing to ignore. Its actually interesting. I think it fits into the phenomenon known as change blindness where people are not apt to pick up on changes that they dont expect to happen even if the changes are very drastic. There have been studies done on this where like a person was being helped by a receptionist and the receptionist bent down to pick something up and a different person wearing the same outfit popped up in their place and something ridiculous like  percent of people didnt notice the switch Since people tend to think of gender as an immutable quality it can make them pretty oblivious.Also some anecdotal evidence from personal experience I went to my sisters graduation party over the summer and she invited two of our teachers that havent seen me since I looked like this and I show up to the party looking like this They dont ask questions they dont say anything and they still refer to me as my sisters sister. If the people you work with are as ignorant of trans issues as you describe then they most likely will not notice a thing.As for my experience coming out at workI work at a daycare at a very liberal university where half the staff and quite a few of the parents fall under the lgbtqia umbrella so they knew how to handle it.,ftm,cw4lsip,6,t5_2t9mw

I do not want people to ask me if I am trans at all but at these kinda places where I would be able to find someone more open to trans people they do ask me so and when they ask me it is in a almost unwelcoming and suspicious way like I dont belong there. Also I have gay friends but they are all guys. When we go out we usually go to gay bars with just dudes I did so already before transitioning. Like I said I feel like I have to proof my self because often people have not believed I am trans. Not only in those context also when making new friends where they think I would be joking and asked for my ID to proof it before I changed my gender on my ID. I know that sounds ridiculous but that is the way it is. I have dated before colleagues or girls I knew via my sister but it never got further then some initial dates because eventually they would back out if things got more serious. I would like to date people from queer groups the thing is like I said it often almost feels like I am not queer enough. and yes I am sure Amsterdam is very very different I am talking here about extremely politically correct anarcho feminist hyper gender queer type of places haha,ftm,cwr7lup,1,t5_2t9mw

5766254,0,t3_3u3otk,Like most jokes like these in cis media I dont believe it ever occurred to the writers that this could be offensive to trans people. For cis people genitals are sex are gender. Thats literally the only determining factor for them so it seems like a simple and harmless enough question to them. Personally I do find the hot dog or bun line tasteless but the character themself is definitely just poking fun at the androgyny look thats popular in high fashion. The Zoolander films are mocking the modeling world as being vapid stupid and wearing ridiculous clothing.Mocking an androgynous presentation and trying to force it to conform based on the genitals the person has is inherently transphobic however in this case Id classify it as a microaggression. I dont believe the joke was made in a hateful way but an ignorant one.The thing is as shitty as it is when I see boy comedies I go in expecting at least a few jokes to make me uncomfortable but to probably enjoy the movie as a whole. Ill still see it because I love the first Zoolander but I expect scenes surrounding this character to be uncomfortable.

I have UK residency at the moment so I have been considering it  London just so damn stressful Im not sure I could live in this city while transitioning might have to actually check out some of the rest of the country. Ive also heard a few horror story about the NHS waiting times.. How much approximately did the private route cost for hormones and top surgery? And how long was the wait? ,ftm,cxyn0da,2,t5_2t9mw

5952163,0,t1_cxzu461,I dont think its mean or ungrateful. I feel the same way many times and to me its because instead of focusing on my humanity turning me into the trans poster child or community educator just points out how different I am.

5953631,0,t3_3wyefs,It helped me with the anxiety of being in the waiting room of this sort of doctor and dealing with receptionists etc to bring a woman with me. I dont know if theres someone in your life youd feel comfortable bringing but when I did this I had an exgirlfriend who was able to just be there and that way I felt like people just assumed the appointment was hers. She never actually came into the exam room with me. Also Xanaxativansomething like that. My regular doctor prescribed it and I needed it. Additionally I think its reeeeallly important for this kind of doctor to be especially transsavvy and respectful. At least it was for me. I dont know if you have the flexibility of course not everyone has options when it comes to healthcare providers. But I have had my GP refer me and specifically make sure that when she was referring me the doc she was referring me to understood I was a man and was ok with treating me. That was helpful and reassuring and I didnt get surprised during my appointment by a shittier than necessary situation. Edit Ive actually never had a pelvic exam. But these are the techniques I used when seeing this type of doctor leading up to and after my hysto. ,ftm,cy01uz4,1,t5_2t9mw

I appreciate what youve added to the post and I try my best not to be a jerk. I kind of am a jerk sometimes but I prefer being labeled as charmingly sarcastic and nihilistic than just a plain old jerk. I dont think I fetishize peoples body parts... I mean I suppose I fetishize the whole person as Im usually ver attracted and horned up for the whole man who he is inside and out and that wont change if hes cis or trans. Which I suppose is a good thing? At least I hope Im not fetishizing. Ive been with guys who have expressed their interest in me because Im Latin and I find that very arousing and have no problem with being objectified and fetishized... but I understand that everyone is different and what works for me doesnt work for all men.And than you for the compliment! I think Im very dateable again dont ask my ex. Where abouts are you? I know that no place is as queer as SF but I hope youre someplace comfortable for you? And Ill keep kinky groups in mind...

6054189,0,t1_cycymsr,I second this. If my sexual partner thought of my dick as anything but a dick Id be outta there fast. Early in my transition I had a lesbian girlfriend said she was bi but was very clearly not who tried to lick my dick like it was a clit and it was horrifying and very unpleasant for me. Probably for her too. Anyway I love when my current straight girlfriend blows me and I love fucking her with a prosthetic. She jerks me off and plays with my balls what we call my front hole too which I enjoy. Our committed relationship is well rounded but we are really really into sex. We have sex every day with the rare night off or bonus two in a day. The idea that trans men dont need sex in the same way cis men do is weird to me. I know there are asexuals among us but my sex drive went way up when I started T and has stayed pretty stable after the initial teenage jerkathon the first few months. Also calling him preop post top surgery is kinda questionable. Not trying to be snarky there just giving you the info in case you arent aware of the surgery situation for trans men. Many if not most trans guys dont get bottom surgery since it is prohibitively expensive rarely covered by insurance and the results are not to the same standards as they are for mtf bottom surgery. I hope to get it but its not as simple as top surgery. ,ftm,cyd7c9e,7,t5_2t9mw

It just simply didnt shock me as much as I originally thought but I truly do like him .

He s been nothing but accepting  asking me to hang n inviting me to work outs n has been happier to talk to someone about it since he feels more relaxed.

So its not cool to just be like oh these trans people didnt likeget what I said it must be because LGBT people are all batshit crazy thirdwave feminists and not because there might actually be something wrong with what Im saying. What you said didnt come across as insulting thirdwave feminism it came across as you assuming we are thirdwave feminists because were LGBT and insulting us for it. Thats making generalizations about us and judging what we say based on our being LGBT which is unfair. Trust me theres as much diversity and different types of people and opinions in the LGBT community as there is in the rest of society at large.I do hope that you get the help you need and work through this.

Or is it good for me to compete there so I fill a spot and the organizers of those races wont consider dropping the womens category all together?And like Im conflicted because I really want to organize a women take over of the local river during the paddlefest but like the person spearheading that should probably be a woman ie not me a nonwoman human and my lady boater friends all think it would be awesome but dont want to go to the trouble of organizing it.I will say that I dont feel conflicted at all wrt the sense of community with lady boaterslike zero of us are dudes and since dudes are like  of our sport that sense of community is still there and pretty much the same.

I dont have too many fond memories of my college experience except for the strange counterculture group I fell into where we just did a lot of drugs but most of those kids dropped out because of well the drug use so by the end of my time there I had very few friends and was surrounded by people who were super bubbly and overly friendly but not actually interested in me as a personthey were more just using me to fulfill their fantasies that they were all great people. Just one giant circle jerk. I became the token trans person to everyone when really if theyd actually spoken to me theyd have realized that I am nowhere close to their super queer liberal gender nonconforming friend. I am very much a product of my upbringing which means that I am conservative conventional and not at all a fan of the Kumbaya culture at my schoolliberal ethics are about as far as my liberal beliefs extend. So basically it was all transphobia masked as acceptance because they all wanted so badly to believe what they already thought to be true about trans people to the extent that they ignored me as a person and just used me as a vessel for a bunch of shit that I didnt even want to be associated with.

6692246,0,t3_47a9yf,Hmm.. If that was actually the case then everyone should go on low dose to prevent MPB. I think genetic predisposition is the most significant factor as well as DHT levels. If you dont have the recessive gene for baldness even with high DHT levels you wont go bald. However if you have both your DHT can accelerate the progression of baldness which is why medical treatments aim to block DHT receptors. DHT production is linked to testosterone so logically it follows that the higher your dosage the more DHT is produced. Also baldness itself is not simply losing strands of hair or hair thinning out. The most telltale sign is the recession of your hairline in either a M shape widows peak or an upside down U shape. The thinning of hair on testosterone is a normal phenomenon. The hormone estrogen is what gives women thicker hair so it follows that if you are taking testosterone to override your estrogen production your hair will thin out. ,ftm,d0bjc4r,1,t5_2t9mw

6728698,0,t3_47sjmn,The moment of sticking the needle in has always been a bit cringey for me. Almost surreal that Im stabbing myself. But I am habituated to it.The mechanism on an epipen is called an autoinjector and I just read a bit about their function. It seems there are similar products for general use i.e. you can load them with any medication. Its not by any means in common use for T but I dont see why it wouldnt be possible with an increased cost. My one concern would be whether it allows you to aspirate before injecting and whether aspirating is really important some authorities disagree on this. This cis guy with low T has a homemade autoinjector This prefilled auto injector testosterone product was recently being tested ,ftm,d0fb165,4,t5_2t9mw

I hate the constant anxiety of not disclosing. I think it ruins the beginning of the relationship not knowing if the person Im with will still like me when they know. That feeling sucks ass. I think you should really have a talk with this guy If possible.

6752474,0,t1_d0hr6r9,There are some people who have gone on T and then stopped for various reasons. It depends on how long you have been on it. If you are only on T for a few weeksless than  months changes will most likely revert easily except probably voice. You can probably research going off T and a good website about this is  which talks about whats more permanent and what isnt.As for transitioning in school it depends on your situation. Are you in an accepting area or a conservative one? Do you have LGBT friends or a support group? It might be worthwhile to join one. You can ask your friends to start calling you a preffered namepronouns and even teachers. Id also say its harder to be stealth in high school so you may have to deal with being openly trans for a while if thats ok with you.,ftm,d0hrhca,5,t5_2t9mw

Fortunately for me I didnt feel as violated  I think Im more comfortable with that part of my body generally  but I was pretty amazed.  I also had a gynecologist tell me once that she could tell I was constipated and then take me on a transvaginal tour of my digestive system.  That was also pretty surreal but she wasnt nasty and it didnt scar me.uabandonthefort has it right about you not necessarily needing one if youve never had vaginal sex.  I did some googling and found confirmation from the Mayo Clinic which is a pretty respectable name this side of the pond.  Here it is EDIT  Misread not sexually active as never sexually active.

It seems that people cant stop themselves from instigating whenever so much as a mention of a trans person comes up. Its really sickening. You can say something as innocuous as hey this person was trans and youll automatically have some shrieking defensive asshole burst out of the woodwork to scream about gender politics.A while back I saw someone say that its creepy how insular trans people are and how its  so cultlike that trans people seem to stick so closely to their communities to the exclusion others.

My doctor said pharmacies usually do overfill vials at least Walgreens does. I pointed it out because before I switched to the current needles I was using needles that didnt have any waste at all. I was injecting . mL a week and while I should only have been able to get  shots out of the  mL vial I ended up getting .

Here is what I would say you have to understand that man are generally heavier than women. A man who is  should generally weight more than a woman who is . Dont look at the scale like you used to. T causes fat redistribution and weight gain. Work out it will change how you view that weight. That fat will turn into muscle if you work out consistently. Me bulking  pounds of fatmuscle means that my biceps r bulging my thighs are thicker and my stomach is bigger. Also watch what you eat.

Ive also done volunteering in schools for which I needed a background check  flagging up my transition and previous name  and the school were absolutely fine about it were perfectly understanding and everything was kept confidential. Be kind polite friendly and focused on doing a damn good job. Dont view being trans as some sort of barrier or disadvantage.

Thats what people do when they enjoy something. Its only a problem if it interferes with your life. When its in mental illness territory. For some reason it seems okay to many people to spend  hours every day watching TV but if you spend  hours every day building model planes or something they dont like then youre obsessed.

I was really sick as a kid and was constantly having blood taken and tests done and needles just freak me the fuck out now. theres no getting around that. its literally a miracle that Im able to submit myself to blood testing as often as I do for transitioning because Id love to just blow it off and run and hide but I willingly sit in terror through it every time.it would be great if I could go back to therapy and kick this anxiety too but the fact of the matter is I can barely afford to transition and definitely cant afford therapy on top of that,ftm,d26w2h0,1,t5_2t9mw
7291944,0,t3_4f9029,Maybe this is unhelpful but if you feel like everything is going fine and youre happy with your changes do your levels really matter? If youre happy with whats happening in your body what do some numbers on the page really have to do with anything?I might be biased  Im nonbinary and not looking to transition into a hairy manbeast  but Im on a tiny dose of T and am happy with how my voice and body have changed. My doc says my T levels are at the very low cisman range but he figures that as long as Im happy with how things are going then it really doesnt matter what my chart says and Im inclined to agree.I guess what Im trying to say is if youre happy with how things are going and really cant do needles then dont do needles. You might find yourself transitioning a little more slowly than other guys but youll get there eventually. If the longer time isnt an issue for you then dont sweat it.Alternatively you can do gels and pellets like others have suggested but ultimately its your body and your transition so dont feel pressured if your doc thinks your levels are off when youre happy with the changes youre seeing.,ftm,d271mnm,1,t5_2t9mw

7411056,0,t3_4gssop,gt she really does like me and says she thinks our sex would be great. One hard lesson Ive learned is that when people say stuff like that its because they really do want to have sex with you. Shes not lying. Its possible she may be overwhelmed but its just asor morelikely that shes already thought about that possibility and still wants you.That said theres no reason you need to start things off with a striptease. Talk with her about what feels good and what makes you uncomfortable find out what shes interested in trying and set up some boundaries so you can both experiment within those limits. ,ftm,d2kl6uu,9,t5_2t9mw

Would still avoid reachingstretchingstrenuous lifting when possible but any doc will clear you around the  week mark. Drains usually out between a week and two weeks.

She said I dont understand why you cant just be a girl. Youre so beautiful and it would be best for you to just live your life as one. For the record my mum considers herself agender although she doesnt use that term in particular so some of the why cant you live as a girl may have come from her feelings of having to force herself into the strictly girl box sociallypresentationally. Damn Im going through the exact same thing right now. My mom told me shed rather be a guy too and that she acted and dressed like a guy in her teen years. Theres a lot of things we agree on and lots of ways we are alike. So many parallels. I told her if she wanted to transition she totally could but she said No no I dont of course that would be more difficult anyway. Is there anything that helped particularly with you and your mother? She tells me I dont know if you are playing a role now or if you were playing a role before. She tells me to just live with a male name and pronouns and constantly says I dont need hormones or anything else.

It could be considered reconstructive surgery which cis men can get though it depends on your insurance whether theyd need to know specific circumstances. Like if a cis guy was in an accidental fire and his junk got messed up from that and needed surgery insurance would probably pay for it but if because hes an idiot he sets his own self on fire on purpose insurance might not pay for it.

7644202,0,t3_4jllm7,It was a relief to come across this thread. I have not started physical transition yet I am FAABulous ha but realized almost immediately after exiting the closet for the final fucking time is dark in there! that go figure the only way I can feel comfortable expressing my love for stereotypically feminine things is when Im being perceived as male deep voice facial hair and so on. But yeah. For right now since getting called she is becoming so uncomfortable Ive had to tweak my personal style a bit to at least try and up the likelihood of passing as a guy and just to kinda establish a difference between then and now. So I dyed my hair back to my natural color a couple of weeks ago. I got A LOT of mostly negativecatcall attention with bright red hair yet it was Part Of Who I Am. It was really difficult to give up something I had done for  years that at one point actually felt validating to me but began making me feel like a target. Now I feel invisible and sort of generic and THATS weird for me too. It is so uncomfortable living in this pretransition limbo while I figure all this out. It feels like Im damned if I do damned if I dont. Its surreal to me that taking T and having top surgery is apparently the only way I can truly embrace makeup nail polish and skirts...but thats just how I see myself in my minds eye....and its agony having to continue walking around in this woman costume knowing that most people just assume Im a butch lesbian. Not that theres anything wrong with butch lesbians...Im just not a woman. I think part of my problem is needing to feel somewhat validated and gendered correctly in the real world since I work in the tech industry with a lot of surprisingly binaryheteronormative people and not being in a position where passing as a younger guy really makes sense. I used to work at the Apple Store and I really find myself missing the sort of neutralizing anonymity of those iconic shirts. ,ftm,d3b3rxm,0,t5_2t9mw

8118995,0,t3_4qf6ci,Hey! s dude here!! ...by and large actual binders were not available. But even back then wordonthestreet was that ace bandages were unsafe. Ways guys i knew dealt with binding Removing the extra panelling from an abdominal support brace and strapping it around the chest worked pretty good and held up to physical work conditions. It did require occasional readjustment cause it would slide down over time. The price was right though and available at almost any drug store! Largerchested guys often used this option. Gymnastic sports bras come in an extrastrong variety that was basically the top half of a binder. This was my method of choice. You could get them online or from sports clothing catalogs.  For smallerchested guys some had success cutting off the legs of tummymashing pantyhose and wearing two layers of them  like a homemade gymnastics sports bra. Again available for cheap at the nearest drug store!  Every now and then someone would get crafty and start inventing a contraption that was similar to a binder. Required a little sewing riveting or similar skills.  We would also discuss ways of dressing to minimize the appearance of chest curves. I was a fan of Hawaiian shirts and the like.

8484984,0,t1_d60pc28,I cant speak for OP but I will share my experience. Society has always shoved down my throat that being a masculinebutch woman  ugly OBVIOUSLY not true at all but I was bullied pretty heavily. In my mind growing up I thought if I was ugly I would be disgusting and unlovable which was a huge fear that was made worse by bullying. So I overcompensated with femininity and repressed my desire to be a man because I was taught that being afab and wanting to be masculine was a oneway ticket to never being loved. So now that Im transitioning I still have these fears. Right now to strangers I know I come across as a very butch woman even though I feel manly as hell. Even though I love the way I look and personally think Im looking sexy as hell lately this sounds conceited but Im finally learning to love myself I know that society doesnt see me that way. I know this is going to get worse psychologically when I start passing because this will confirm my deeprooted fears that Im actually just an inherently masculine woman and therefore undesirable. Its irrational I know this but its hard to undo years of severe bullying and internalized transphobia.I see old pictures of myself from right before I started transitioning and I looked so pretty. It hurts because Im giving up something I worked towards for SO long even if it wasnt me at all even if I was suicidal like that. Its what society wanted and its so hard to say fuck you and go the exact opposite direction even if my soul is begging me to. But Im doing it anyways. I hope this made sense I feel like I explained it poorly.,ftm,d6263dg,2,t5_2t9mw

Injecting the air bubble at the end my help keep the fluid in place til absorption.  Try these two methods and see which works best for you.

Went to a STEM boarding school for the last two years of high school went to college on the other side of the country. Then I worked to be selfsufficient and save up money. I suppose I could have started therapy and hormones in college but I was so scared of my parents finding out. Also I told everyone who would listen that I was transgender. I started going by a male name thats still my name today. I dressed in masculine clothing whenever possible. I got my hair cut short. I focused a lot on school and hobbies to get my mind off things. I played MMORPGs as a male character and told people on the internet I was male. It didnt work perfectly and only you know what will work for you.

This might sound odd but T or top surgery was the easy part. There are so many things that I had to think about when I started thinking of myself as the person I was and wanted to be. What kind of mens clothes would I finally get to wear? What kind of activities made me feel good and masculine? Which websites make me feel better about my dysphoria? At a certain point I also navigated binding without my parents knowing and wore masculine clothes. I guess it depends on your situation.Theres also a lot to be said about working out...

My face and body shape have also changed a lot in that timeyoure definitely not alone in being a late bloomer. If it would help I can PM you pictures of my facial changes at various points in my transition. Gel can also make things happen a little bit more slowly than injectionsin general its as effective but some people dont respond well to it and end up needing to switch to shots eventually. You can tell if your dosage is appropriate or not based on what your levels are and if theyre consistent. If they havent consistently been in whats considered the normal male range then that could definitely be impacting your results.Im sorry youre dealing with this and that its causing you so much stress.

Theyre very durable I didnt wash them properly but thats just me. The full length are hard to get into and extremely uncomfortableunmovable once on fully. If you want breathability and comfort go for GCB. Also to add the Underworks binder digs into side boob and alao gives you back lumps where you probably dont. The GCB keeps those areas for the most part flat and shaped with your body. Underworks is serious compression and for most people will nearly vanish the chest I say most because mine are stupid immovable and grossly perky so they never really stayed put.

You wont keep it without having the phlegm and I should hope you dont promote a respiratory infection to sound male. lol.One thing you can do is keep your vocal apparatus as relaxed as possible. Your pitch goes up with tension in the body. Doing the occasional fake yawn will help relax the muscles of your throat and neck.Throwing your vocal chords for a deeper pitch or squeezing them together for a rasp can cause damage and fatigue. Vocal nodes can even steal your voice. I just dont think its worth the risk.Remember to use good breath support and project. I would focus on male intonation and syntax instead. You can still sound like a girl with a masculine pitch if you dont adopt typically male speaking patterns. Right now this is something you can focus on adapting without risking your vocal health. Even young boys who have high pitched voices sound male because they use male vocal patterns. Its worth considering right?,ftm,d6p6bad,2,t5_2t9mw

You may also provide them with a name if you have a preference but they are in the business and may know people who are good at it.Medicare will cover the cost of a hysto provided you have the appropriate documentation regarding your trans diagnosis. Likewise your insurance is obliged to cover you for anything that medicare covers. If you have private health insurance then you will be able to have it done through the private health system.If you like I can let you know what my obgyn has to say once Ive seen her.

8718598,0,t3_4zeh4i,Just my own experience with your questions  ive been on T for  years and also backpack. The doctor gave me a typical dose mg biweekly when i started out and it has never changed sense. I just need to commute to the nearest big city once a year so she can check my blood work and make sure im still in good health. Most guys i know havent experienced much adjustment to their dosage.Injection takes  minutes out of my life every other week. Its nothing. Ive skipped doses forgot a day moved my schedule around it didnt do much aside from give me greasier skin. I inject in the same site every time and i have zero scar tissue.Ive had a hysto. I dont like the idea of being dependent on medication but if the zombie apocalypse hits i guess ill just be extra careful to eat my calcium. Ill just garden more kale or something! People get their gonads removed and shut down all the time for thousands of reasons. Theyre not dropping like flies. I dont expect to either.Cypionate comes in really little vials and syringes arent too big either. Taking them packing isnt a problem. I do think one time my vial got cold and the T started to precipitate out of solution. It looked like long little crystals  kinda cool really! I held it in my hands and warmed it up and it redissolved back into the oil. I havent had the chance yet but i wouldnt hesitate to go out on the trail for a severalmonth long trek with T in tow. As it is now im not usually out on the trail much more than  weeks so i can always readjust my shot schedule so i dont need to bother bringing any.Thats cool that youre doing SAR stuff! ,ftm,d6vgqct,5,t5_2t9mw

8774096,0,t3_508gix,Back when I worked at a kindergarten pre coming out there was another dude who worked there and what I remember most about him is that his energy levels were always really high when we were playing outside.

When he wasnt around theyd try to get me to play it but apparently I was awful at it haha.I dont think he was any less hands on than I was maybe a little bit.

8783677,0,t3_50f85n,It really depends on how much your body hates you. Ive been on pills worked for a couple of months then spotting and mirena. Mirena made me bleed not spot for  months before i was given extra progesterone pills to stop it and im still upping my dose every other month because i start bleeding again. I have to stress this is NOT normal at all but if it happens doctors just shrug and say bad luck because they also have no idea. Id reccomend just trying things honestly the vast majority of people have reduced or no bleeding with mirena if it does happen you can have it taken out. Only reason I didnt was because shark week was normally heavy and I preferred the hope of it maybe working as opposed to knowing every month would be hell.,ftm,d73mrdr,1,t5_2t9mw
8788156,0,t3_50hw1r,No proof either way because no long term studies have been done on it. I think most people get hysto because they figure better safe than sorry or because its a requirement for certain types of lower surgery. Plenty of people dont get one though and clearly they arent dying in mass numbers so...its up to you. It is a serious surgery and recovery can be difficult in various ways. So like any other surgery Id say not to do it unless you have a good reason. If you dont do it you definitely need to get regular gynecological checkups. Lack of preventative care is definitely a factor in trans mens health problems. For some guys like myself that alone is enough of a reason.,ftm,d746z71,2,t5_2t9mw

All I am asking is that they call me by the appropriate name and pronouns. They do it for everyone else and they did it for me before I started transitioning. This is not hard to do and if they choose to be hurt by it they should be handling that privately with a professional. It has nothing to do with my transition and everything to do with their outlook on it and beliefs about trans people.I have supportive friends who are helping me transition who are very happy and excited for me  I honestly think it has been and will continue to be a positive change in their life because theyre going to get a happier more mentally stable edition of me to socialize with  Theres no reason besides transphobia as far as Im concerned that people should feel hurt or dragged along by my transition. Im doing something to make myself healthier and happier and by extension its a favor that Im doing for friends and family  allowing them to meet and love my true self. If they reject that opportunity thats on them not me.That said Im not one to base my decisions on other peoples reactions if they dont directly involve other people and Im guessing this wont be too helpful if you already feel guilty.

8886860,0,t3_51yw20,The selffunded plans put folks in a really terrible spot in terms of using the recent Affordable Care Act ruling in appeals for coverage. I was really fortunate to have a selffunded Aetna plan that specifically included genderaffirming surgeries in the covered benefits but because the plan is selffunded your employer is paying directly for your health benefits and is thus theoretically exempt from complying with the ACA ruling because a selffunded plan is not subsidized in the same way that the fullyfunded package plans are.  Unfortunately to the best of my knowledge it is correct that the only way to get around the exclusion in a selffunded plan is for your employer to change the plan. If youre willing to wait another few months it may be worth it to work with your employer to change you plan in January. That said you could also see if your employer would agree to reimburse the cost of your surgery somehow. ALSO I wanna point out that Aetna doesnt cover nipple grafts which I believe is the K mystery charge tacked on to my claim which doubled the amount I was expecting to pay out of pocket for top surgery | ,ftm,d7g2pjd,1,t5_2t9mw

8905172,0,t3_528een,Its interesting my mother hated the name I had initially chosen for myself.  Its a name thats been with the family for a long time and Ive been using it to myself for myself for a few years now since long before I seriously thought about coming out.  As I got closer to being out I thought that for continuitys sake ? might not be a bad idea to use a name with my same first initial so I had a second name rolling around in my head. When I came out to my mother she INSTANTLY hated the first name I had chosen which is odd because I recall asking her when I was a child if I had been born a boy what would she have named me?  And it was actually the first name.  She didnt remember this and said no shed never have called me that.  Anyway this shook me up a bit so I took the second name and have been using it with people Im out with but I just cant get used to it.

Many people bind for longer than  hours and have no trouble doing so but obviously doing so for less time is better. If your binder is comfortable does not cause pain does not restrict breathing and fits you well you could probably continue wearing it until you went home and went to sleep. If it does cause any pain or trouble breathing however youd probably want to take it off for longer than an hour if you could.

As a kid I wanted a penis but what happy wearing skirts and dresses and thought of my gender as alien because boys and girls seemed different and I clearly wasnt of this planet. There were a lot of other factors to my alienness that arent quite relevant here. At  I still thought of myself as a femme lesbianforcible drag queenI was femme as a child why does this not feel right anymore? yet as soon as I read about T and top surgery I wanted it. Fast forward through several years of confusion I got to the point where we were learning about the effects of steroids during my fifth year in a healthy living class and I thought I really want that. And the problem was everyone thought I was Hermione and some really prudish feminine nerd girl yet I still wanted to be on steriods and I didnt think it could be allowable or legal.And then I decided I was a trans manpartly tried to convince myself because I though it was the only way I could transition  but that never really worked properly and honestly being a man means very little to me but T seems exciting to the point I wonder its a bad idea because by watching my changes I might actually have fun unlike a good trans martyr who bears their transition stoically. I mean gender euphoria is a thing but I use humor to defy the hangups of my brain.I usually present in a masculine way now femme clothing alters the way my body looks and the perceptions of society in a way that is detrimental to me and dont miss it but as it is I think Ill keep a few skirts around to eventually fuck with people.My identity is bullshit because I have a constantly evolving brain that will never settle down but my desires are constant and they are to transition. If I dont like it I can stop. I think actions behaviours desires feelings are all part of being trans and identity only can scratch the surface. ,ftm,d8460dv,2,t5_2t9mw

9239542,1,t3_56wbno,I agree with your take. I think its damaging to the representation of trans people to continue to play in the womens league even though I understand why he wants to his friends are there hes close to retirement etc.. We cant have it both ways. We can tell people we are men get treated like men and be men but when we do shit like play on a the womens team it should come as no surprise when people misgender us and treat us like less than men. Men dont play on womens teams plain and simple. edit Im genuinely curious what the justification is from those who are down voting my comment. Why wouldnt trans men be subject to the same rules as cis men? I personally absolutely do not want anyone treating me differently from other men since I am one. If I still wanted to enjoy the few perks of being a woman I wouldnt have transitioned. Its disrespectful to women to stay in their league and sends a terrible clear message that we arent real men. ,ftm,d8n6gnc,1,t5_2t9mw

The policies themselves are more important than the religious affiliation Not to give unsolicited advice but if your school has transfriendly housing policies and such I would recommend selfadvocating as much as you are able to live in the dorm of your choosing etc. Youll have to single yourself out as trans to administrators and perhaps go through paperwork and you may be denied but you have to actively take advantage of stuff like genderneutral housing policies if you want to benefit from it. I was relaxed about it my freshman year and ended up living on a girls only hall when I could have been on a mixed hall. My sophomore year I lived on a completely genderneutral hall with genderneutral bathrooms and I couldnt believe the difference it made for my mental health.Its also good practice for talking to admins writing emails etc  it sounds silly but those skills are a close second in importance to you know actual academic ability at college.,ftm,d94j8zn,1,t5_2t9mw

9393001,0,t3_594ugj,I was told to stop by my surgeon  I didnt. Theres no real medical evidence to substantiate it being an issue. I stopped smoking joints and bought a high quality glass bong didnt smoke at all for a few days either side of the surgery just to be sure and didnt start smoking joints again for  weeks after. My results are fine still totally even and no tissue regrowth which is apparently the main risk. This is thought because enormous quantities of cannabis given to rats in a test setting caused growth of the mammaries. We cannot feasibly consume the same amount that they gave to this rats in that time frame if I remember the results correctly. So I cant recommend it because my doctor told me not to and I have no medical training... But I did it and I came out unscathed.,ftm,d96mo75,2,t5_2t9mw

Like telling one person to walk a mile and telling the second person to walk a mile on their hands and person one asks person two whats taking them so long.Low iron can definitely impact energy levels fatigue is a side effect. Im guessing they prescribed iron transfusions because youre unable to take iron pills or absorb the iron from pills? If you are able to take pills though you can grab them from any drug store so theyre significantly more affordable than an infusion would be.SSRIs are also linked to decreased motivation and emotional blunting in some people so its possible the antidepressant youre on may be affecting it. You could talk to your doctor about trying a different one if you thought that might be better?I dont have much to say in the way of advice for exercise and it sounds like youve had enough advice already.

9600933,0,t3_5chj8e,Her comments were kind of shitty. Thats totally not the way to approach it.But!Try looking at it like this many hetero women and women in general have been opting to keep their own last names when they marry as a sign of womens rights. Women traditionally took their husbands name to denote they belonged to them. Hence why its Mr and Mrs Husbands Name. A lot of women are now taking a stand and keeping their own name because they live in a society where they dont have to give up their identities when they married.She definitely should have talked kinder to you no question. Your feelings are valid and she needs to understand that. However it doesnt mean necessarily that youre less of a man to her. Try asking if she would change her name with a female partner or a cis man.

Once you become independent you can get T. You can use it for a few months to lower your voice then get off of it if you want. No one has to know. If youre in the US they are not legally allowed to know unless you explicitly give your doctor permission to tell them if youre . All they can see even if they own your insurance is that you visited a doctor and it cost X. They cant see which doctor. They cant see what services you got. You could keep your T at a friends house. Or keep it at your doctors and do the shots there. You could keep it at work. You could keep it in your underwear drawer. Use your leg razor to shave your face if you start growing facial hair that you want to hide. If they dont suspect anything theyre not going to notice. Hell just call T voice surgery. Or tell your family and friends that you got a cold and it messed up your voice permanently. That actually happened to my aunt. Whatever you do stay safe and know that we love you for your authentic self. If nothing else we will be your family. ,ftm,daoktbz,4,t5_2t9mw

9884295,0,t3_5gxooq,Fellow ftm here! I have multiple tips for you I just recently started transitioning so say and Im sure I could be of assistance. The first method I suggest is the camisole method this works better with smaller breasts but seems to have some effect on everyones no matter the cup size. However I have heard bigger breasts can cause issues with this method and should be avoided wearing this during hot weather is also not recommended. Camisole binding method  NEVER USE ACE BANDAGES. Do NOT risk your health just for a flattening effect. Im sure you are already aware of this.The next method I can recommend is the double sports bra trick which is exactly what it says. You put on two non padded supportive sports bras and it should help a ton! This one is not as effective for me Im a B cup so Id say its mostly for people with smaller breasts.Im not as familiar with this one but I have heard of it. You should probably google it for more info but its the pantyhose method where you cut out the top of some pantyhose and fold it a few times around your chest. While you did say that you didnt have access to a binder I will link a review of some cheap binders incase this option becomes available to you. I recommend the Gcb one because all my friends rant and rave about it and its somewhat cheap Christmas is coming up if you celebrate it and you could always ask for  and buy it through someone else. Its only I hope this helps a little bit if you have any more questions or need advice or ANYTHING just message me! ,ftm,davy46t,3,t5_2t9mw

9976809,0,t3_5ifpzg,Im in the same boat as you and it is this is why in part I have put off transitioning for so long. It does not feel right to me to proceed without coming to terms with and dealing with my trauma and dissociation. I thought I was about to finally start after  years was supposed to get into gender therapy etc sometime in the next two weeks and yet tonight Im having cold feet for the first time in a long time. Im scared honestly and I am terrified to come out the other side unable to return if I find out that  years down the road or something it was all just a way to deal with trauma. I dont feel like it is and I have picked myself apart very well in that regard and yet old fears die hard. Unfortunately having some sort of DIDlike disorder does mean that it would be unethical to many medical professionals to allow you access to hormones and surgery. At least not until the trauma dissociation selfloathing and identity issues that come with those sorts of conditions have been dealt with.I do think you are right in that it may be best to wait before going through the medical aspects of transition.  ,ftm,db808ch,3,t5_2t9mw

10036033,0,t3_5jeqxf,Congrats on your upcoming surgery! I had DI and I definitely couldnt have carried a backpack  weeks postop. I went back to work after  weeks and actually carried a tote bag instead of a backpack for another  weeks or so until I felt comfortable with a backpack. Since I had DI I obviously had much more scarring to work with so you may find youre okay with a backpack much sooner. Id say be very very cautious at  weeks I think asking for a temporary parking permit closer to where you need to be is a great idea. Also on the vitamin E thing Much of the discussion is based off of kinda old research so take it with a grain of salt. Everything Ive read about vitamin E seems to be referring to pure concentrated vitamin E i.e. what you would get if you broken open a capsule of vitamin E. Naturally occurring vitamin E that is in cocoa butter coconut oil shea butter etc is likely not occurring in high enough concentrations to cause any problems. From what Ive gathered the worsening effects on scars seem to be a result of contact dermatitis from pure vitamin E. Especially if youre having peri which will have fairly minimal scarring I think youd be just fine using cocoa butter or something similar rather than shelling out for expensive silicone gel. You can also use straightup silicone lube like ID millennium or Swiss Navy. Id be careful though because silicone lube can stain your clothes if you use too much! They key to scar care is really  time and  keeping things moisturized.For what its worth I alternate cocoa and shea butter both with naturally contain vitamin E depending on the time of day cocoa butter during the day and shea butter at night to lock in moisture longterm and both have helped my scars tremendously rather than worsened them. My slightly hypertrophic spots are flat and soft and my scars and fading as Id expect them to! Heres the transguys.com scar care write up which is very thorough and informative I think the author also had peri so you might find the write up particularly relevant and helpful to you. ,ftm,dbfpzlm,1,t5_2t9mw
10038383,0,t3_5jawbg,Hey man we are in the same place. Im jealous of my boyfriends junk. I wont be touched til I have bottom surgery either. It can be shitty but you are not alone.Please dont be angry at yourself. If anything be angry at fate and use that anger to lift weights or play music or write or take up a martial art or something. Of course I dont always follow my own advice but my anger tends not to be directed at myself but at douchebaggy cis guys who have everything I want and still cant manage to not be bigoted assholes.Sometimes I focus on how much worse everything was before I went on T and had top surgery. Maybe you can do that? As far as sex stuff find a guy who is a bottom when youre ready to date again who understands that under no circumstances can they go near your junk unless they want a knee in theirs. You can try topping with prosthetics that hit your dick a certain way while you enter a guy. I havent found full success but being the penetrating partner affirms my masculinity. Other times it just makes me dysphoric that I cant use my flesh and blood dick to penetrate my partner. Thats when I start debating whether I should choose phallo rather than get meta and see if itll be enough.So thats another tactic...thinking ahead to bottom surgery. As with the other coping mechanisms Ive outlined this one too is a crapshoot. Sometimes thinking about it just makes me scared of the pain and fearful of complications and angry that fate put me here existential angst etc.Sorry I was unable to come up with better advice. My main thing never settle for a guy who doesnt respect your maleness and tries to get you to do shit youd sooner eat live cockroaches than do.And PM me if you want to discuss any of this further.,ftm,dbg1069,2,t5_2t9mw

10047404,0,t1_dbgvmyq,Tip If you have the packer attached to your body with a harness when you pee touch the packer.

10049893,0,t3_5jgdpy,I think although theres some parts that are alright I definitely agree theres some toxic parts there. There seems to be an attitude of hating men in general in some circles and Im not sure whats worse being negative to trans guys for being men or the trans men dont count so theyre not bad mentality. I think its kind of sad in a way how much negativity there is. Also the only place Ive come across a group that call themselves baeddels who are only a tiny step away from TERFtier and a surprisingly large amount of tumblr seems to fall into the mindset that trans men  traitors who dont deserve nice things. Masculinity in general seems to be frowned upon  Ive seen maybe a handful if that of positivity posts for femme transmasculine people but anyone remotely masculine and male identified is immediately spewing toxic masculinity. The whole nameandshame business with Tumblr and the cisbashing just gives the community a bad name. Great way to turn away allies rather than gain them.I think theres just an extreme side of tumblr who are going to be like that over any matter whether its trans related or not. Theres some decent parts but again theres a small but vocal group who think its ok to tell someone to kill themselves because they interpreted a fictional character differently yet alone handle it if someone is different to them in any way! Some people are intolerant and the anonymity of the internet can bring out the worst in people same applies to parts of Reddit too or other site comment sections give someone something to hide behind and concept of treating others nicely can go out the window. ,ftm,dbhiyts,3,t5_2t9mw

10079941,0,t1_daqjazl,you just recounted exactly what i said. i never claimed that T would make fat deposits travel beneath the skin. I said it would stop any fat from settling in that hormonal pattern. and over time which can be sped up by working out but is not CAUSED by working out fat will burn there and not be replaced. new fat will settle in male patterns.the term fat redistribution is not literal. it is the phenomenon of fat OVER TIME settling in a different pattern and burning from areas where it is no longer being replenished. not simply fat moving through the body to different areas. i very clearly said that working out will speed it up. but i also said that the claim that our fat patterns will not change at all without working out as you claimed originally is false. plus we must also acknowledge that many do not recognize that our female body structures is heavily dependent on bone structure. those curvy hips are bones. you can lose the fat surrounding them. but the hips themselves and the degree they stick out isnt going anywhere.its really frustrating that youve ignored my past comments and then attempted to argue with me by stating the exact same argument i made. please read my previous comments before saying the exact same thing and acting as if you saying it makes it more legitimate.,ftm,dblfqbg,1,t5_2t9mw

10103850,0,t3_5jwzaz,My situation is fairly different from yours but I wanted to comment anyway because I feel there is still a really common thread there. Im nonbinary but not out to my family but my whole family does know Im gayqueer and have known for sometime now. They are a really loving family and have never done anything to make me feel unwelcome. Ive always been told Im loved no matter what. However I still get selfconscious sometimes that maybe Ive let my mom down for not being the straight daughter shed hoped for. I even told her that over Christmas and she was really shocked to hear it and said Please dont put those kind of statements on me you have NEVER let me down. A few weeks ago I was visiting my aunt and we were curled up on the couch and talking about queer stuffdating and I had this thought flash through my head I cant believe she is comfortable being this physically close to me while Im talking about lesbian stuff. Which is utterly ridiculous because shes my aunt for godsake. Ive had a lot of therapy to work through internalized homophobia and Im recognizing my reactions as just really old defense mechanismsfear that is still left behind from childhood that horrible dread of people thinking I am grossdifferenta freak because Im gay. My whole point is I do not think your feelings are exclusive to just being trans. I think any person who is made to feel different or marginalized no matter what group can really struggle to wonder if theyre really being accepted even in the face of total acceptance. It simply takes time. I believe as you continue to gain confidence and know you are the beautiful person you are those feelings youre describing in your post will start to fade. They might still come up from time to time but you can be aware of them for what they are and work on letting them go. I think accepting the love of others when you have really struggled to love yourself is a process but one that gets easier over time. ,ftm,dbojl0z,1,t5_2t9mw
10130131,0,t1_dbqp725,gt As per my initial post what actually happened is that I was having a perfectly pleasant conversation with the pharmacy technician when she actually approached the counter and started yelling at me.I think cases like that need to be fully disclosed publicly. You dont have to disclose the pharmacists name but at least disclose the pharmacy so others in your area can avoid it. IMO people who have these kinds of prejudices rarely improve they only get worse.We are a small often discriminated against community. The only way to reduce discrimination against us is to connect better together and warn each other. Also your doctor can very easily confirm youre taking T correctly by running some blood tests to see if your T levels are within normal male range. She cant derail  interfere with your treatment just by making these unsubstantiated claims.,ftm,dbrymij,1,t5_2t9mw

10194972,0,t3_5lz00f,Printed out my therapists letter recommendation for HT this morning. Its almost strange looking at it. The use of my preferred name and he pronouns in an official document is giving me a good feeling but at the same time had that imposter feeling rise up in me. I hate it I always feel like Im not trans enough when I get that. But  years of a particular name and pronoun I can get why it looks weird at first. I respond instantly to my preferred name now though and certainly cringe inside when someone messes up at work. Every now and then my manager will mess up and say yes maam and I have that thought of oh god she doesnt see me as male and at the same time Im all well how could she look at yourself youre like  female looking right now. She doesnt do it on purpose and she immediately corrects herself its just those thoughts coming in.I have a doctors appointment on Friday to look into HT. I was nervous about calling and explaining exactly what I needed but the lady on the phone was very nice. She put down my legal name and put my preferred in parenthesis as a note to the doctor. She didnt act weird just said to make sure to bring my letter and shed get me right in. So Im hoping theyve had trans patients before. Im excited to be closer than I thought Id be. Nervousness is setting in. Once I go through with shots which I doubt Ill get this weekend since I need bloodwork thats a huge step towards the rest of my life. Theres irreversable changes that begin. Im ready for it but Im just scared how my husband will react. How will he cope with the changes gradual though they may be?Time will tell.

10223745,0,t3_5mbq2v,How far are you into transition? Because I felt similarly before transitioning. It was all part of the negative emotional mess of my dysphoria. I think it was also exacerbated by the fact that I grew up in a heavily female environment  I wasnt really allowed to associate with boys and my family was almost entirely female  so as a masculineidentified person who is also attracted toward masculinity both sexually and in terms of friendships etc masculinity was like this waterinthedesert thing for me. After Id spent my life suffocating in femininity it was like... please no more of this! Women reminded me of the fake feminine persona Id created and everything I wanted away from.After transitioning and being on T for a while I began to be able to appreciate the ways women were different to me as something positive and unthreatening to my identity and even something that could make me feel more masculine and developed some attraction to women as well. This was just one of the many positive effects of transition for me and you may find that your discomfort eases as you become more secure and comfortable in yourself as a man.  These days I get women and transwomen just fine because I see that they are simply over there on the other end of the gender spectrum and that were all just where we need to be doing what we need to do.,ftm,dc2x331,4,t5_2t9mw

10246057,0,t1_dc5ch2a,Thank you Squid very well said. Dear ubrickicecream I will quote what I wrote to manowar above gt this project really focusses on the fact that anything can be a penis as long as the guy considers it to be one no matter how bigsmallanything. Male genitals are male because of the gender of the person theyre attached to not because of some possible shape.Also I want to show the world that you are not less transgendermale if you choose not to have bottom surgeryphalloplasty. That transmen can be proud of what they have and that they may show the world also in a nonsexualnonpornographical manner like art. So your fear is actually exactly what Im trying to debunk. I want to show the world how beautiful and masculine we all are no matter what your junk looks like. Its male simply because we are male.I dont know how well youve read my text but I want to tell you again I am transgender too. I know what its like to be fetishized be seen as female be demasculined Ive been asked if it was still somewhat a girl because I dont necessary like my shoulder hair. Also I have never drawn female genitals so in the broader sense of my work I am not at all trying to separate trans men from cis men.I hope I cleared some things up for you.

10315828,0,t1_dcd6dmo,Truly I was very hesitant to post my comment.The spirit of my removed comment was to disambiguate whereas the worst feeling when attacked or being the victim of discrimination for no reason is wondering why...and also to provide more confidence for FTM persons by showing there is relatively low risk for the FTM whether truly passing or not...if one understands how eye contact between unacquainted males is usually interpreted by males and is sometimes responded to by some.Your statement could be interpreted to imply that transgendered persons and homosexuals have historically been accepted by all of society so there is not now and has never been any cause for fear.I however have seen many credible reports about hate crimes against and suicides by transgendered persons which would tend to disprove that notion.Mind you very few involving FTM persons unless they made some male social errors which inadvertently engaged them in conflict...such as extended eye contact with a male who is not an acquaintance especially where alcohol was involved and it was interpreted as a challenge.  EDIT Perhaps I should have pointed out one detail  When you are making eye contact with a male in a washroom and walking toward him he must assess what YOUR intentions are and make a fast decision. The first one to strike is usually the winner.,ftm,dcdcsqu,3,t5_2t9mw

10340539,0,t3_5o16u7,Did I write this? I could have written this like a year ago. Im a teacher from a VERY conservative Christian background.. Family when I came out to my family I went with the medical approach. I presented me being trans to them as a medical condition I had and showed them my diagnosis from my therapist. I also showed them a bunch of medical journals about trans people. This worked really well with some of my family. Not so well with some. My dad and I havent spoken since I came out. It fucking hurts but Im kind of over it at this point. I gotta live my life.. Being a teacher. I live in Texas and teach high school. Coming out has been a mixed bag so my advice is to get your legal name change first. My school gave me the run around about the teacher of record and said they couldnt do anything until my name change was done. I was pretty upfront with my students because theyre old enough to know and recognize whats going on five weeks in I had a huge voice drop and theyve been super chill about it. Pronouns are a mixed bag but a lot of them really try and it means a lot to me. So I wouldnt say that you cant transition as a teacher just get your name worked out asap.,ftm,dcg5qgn,3,t5_2t9mw

I honestly didnt think of calling them to let them know about my legal name change but we recently got a new bus driver.Then later on he says Not wanting to make a scene I just said Oh Im that top one.So it sounds like he forgot to inform the specific bus drivers and he hoped the new name was provided by the school but it wasnt which is an error on their part honestly because its damn near impossible to get through to bus companies about anything. Then he tried to be peaceful and make no scene. And its on a bus and they check your information to get on it and off it the bus driver isnt going to especially for high school students get off the bus to have a private conversation about a name real quick. Also highly doubt any bus company would send out one driver to have said conversation and meeting about a name for one student when they could be working.Just being practical and I know from riding buses in the past or two years ago tbh.

10469668,0,t1_dcut72c,I never said that anything people identify as is automatically true. Rachel Dolezal can identify as black all she wants but that does not make her black. Theres is plenty of evidence for variable gender identity even if its focused on the binaries. There is no evidence for variable species identity or any sort of psychological basis for species or racial identities. Theyre not comparable.Gender identity exists yes? And is not  automatically tied to chromosomes or genitals or whatever. Were all in agreement on this yes? So that means that there is some point in the development of every single human where they are genderless and even sexless and gender exists as a nebula each one possible for that human. Every single gender is theoretically accessible for every single human at some point in development. Therefore there is the potential for the development of nonbinary identities because gender is a thing all on its own and it is universally accessible. But that is not true for species. There is not a point in human development where any species other than human is accessible. For there to be any basis for nonhuman identities there would need to then be some component of nonhumanness in development which would require nonhuman DNA because if its development coded by human DNA or other Homo DNA within expected human genomes its human development. But if theres dog DNA in your human theyre not human anymore. Thats not how it works. But genetics is the only basis we have for species not a defined psychological phenomenon of species identity.while Im typing this all out likewise with race. Race is a social construct. There is not a biological basis for race. The race that is assigned to you as a social recognition of your family history and some physical features is the only basis for race. Racial identities are informed based on assigned race. There is no nebulous moment where you any human could be any race. You are at least partially locked in from the getgo because your mothers race will be partially your own and as soon as whatever point in time your father becomes your father his race is factored in and your race is set. There is no nebulous moment. There is no basis for a genuine psychological phenomenon of racial identity incongruous with assigned race because assigned race is the only basis for race.,ftm,dcuuedq,10,t5_2t9mw

I can honestly say that even mentioning that I might be a guy to my gf at the time was the hardest thing to do. She didnt have to stay with me she says she stayed bc she loves me as a person. However shes still only into women other than me. Being open and honest with your wife will allow them to be open and honest with you. I sense that you know there is no other way to move forward. Maybe having a few conversations about how their potential transition will effect your family will open the door for them to bring up divorce...I wish you the best of luck.

10530400,0,t3_5qs6a7,First off Im sorry for the loss of your aunt it definitely sounds like you were close and you must be missing her a lot. So maybe dont feel like you have to make all these decisions right now. If you need to focus on other things going on in your life transition will still be there once you have had time to grieve. Second if thats how your friend talks to you get a better friend. You can get resources from the internet. Friends are there for mutual support and respect and it doesnt sound like youre getting either of those things from this person. Im sorry for giving such a glib answer but you might find a lot of comfort and support in talking with a counselor or therapist both for your gender identity issues and just life stuff in general. Talking to my therapist has given me support through my transition but also has given me someone to talk to about my own issues with trying to be more assertive and socially confident. As someone who has definitely been where you are though under different circumstances there really are going to be better days ahead for you. Im sending you good thoughts.,ftm,dd1qi5x,1,t5_2t9mw

She also said itll be a good first step to understanding if and when the first irreversible step of transitioning should come into play. It was incredibly informative. I wouldnt fret to much though because at the end of the day if you are trans you are trans. All that matters is what you see when you look in the mirror. There are so many other therapists out there if shes not the one for you. Also shout out to a fellow Texan. I lived right outside of Austin for a few years. ,ftm,dd9tjfg,1,t5_2t9mw

Either find some proof to back up your viewpoint that most trans women see trans men this way  and by proof I mean a large survey or study with respondents from demographics representative of the trans population at large without one or two communities dominating the results  or accept that people will disagree with you and that is not wrong.,ftm,ddazico,7,t5_2t9mw

You go to bed after dying your hair and when you wake up and go into the bathroom you are shocked at the person in the mirror because for a second you think its a stranger.

Was rather sore the next day but I didnt feel the needle going in.Gets significantly easier with time and my legs arent remotely as sore afterwards as they were at first. If youre worried you might fall over or something try injecting on your bed reclining so youre not quite sitting up but not quite lying down even better if youre distracting yourself with Netflix or something during the actual moment of.

Hell yes to being able to pee standing my biggest pain  since transitioning but also hell yes to liking what I have sort of but maybe not?. If youve had a lot of growth on T meta is an option for standing to pee and you dont have to have a vaginectomy. With phallo it is still possible to not have a vaginectomy but the complication rate seems to be high at least from what Ive read. If your major issue is dealing with cis gay dudes Ill just say this. Some people will like you some people wont. It may be because you lack a part that they like it may be because youre not their type or because the chemistry isnt right. You cant force attraction. Phallo may not solve this and you have to ask yourself if it is really worth all of that just so you dont have to disclose your trans status or risk rejection. Only you can answer that question. From my experience there are plenty of guys that are cool with trans guys. Some arent and thats okay too. Hope this helps. ,ftm,ddu2exk,3,t5_2t9mw

10859079,0,t3_5v7550,My wife describes herself as queer because she doesnt feel that lesbian quite applies while shes with me but there are definitely women who still use lesbian. My wife basically says Im the only dudelike person shes ever been attracted to or will be attracted toshe generally finds men unappealing and gets annoyed when people assume shes generally attracted to men just because shes with me ie if a straight female friend tries to ask her an opinion on if she thinks a guy is attractive. She loves me so basically Im the exception. Sometimes I do feel a bit insecure that she might someday find me unappealing in the same way so I make sure to check in with her a lot about how shes feeling. Sometimes I also feel like I need validation of someone finding me attractive as a guy but thats also because I dont pass |,ftm,de01cyz,2,t5_2t9mw
10869729,0,t3_5vbz7r,hey there so im a trans guy and Im completely in love with a trans woman who actually I sometimes even forget we are both trans.If I heard you say that I would not be offended.   I find it almost refreshing.   and many trans men in the past that I knew did NOT date trans women some did.   It can sound fucked up what you said but I have said similar things in reverse.   And guess what?  this is really gonna piss some people off when seeking new platonic friends I actually love hanging with trans women I cant explain it but I do.   Stage of transition or surgery status is irrelevant to me.   But I  will tell you this.  Dating another trans person does not guarantee that you or they will understand each others body issues.   In fact sometimes things can get awkward.    So I wish you the best of luck in finding a nice trans guy you seem really nice so you will.   ,ftm,de14vic,4,t5_2t9mw

10907596,0,t3_5vtpy8,This is very similar to my mom too. Before I came out to the rest of the family for  years! she was super supportive and was even known among my friends for her liberal view. Hell shes the go to gyno for trans guys in my hometown! Then since I came out and started transitioning she completely stopped calling and txt me abruptly so I called my aunt and told her to talk to her and now shes trying to keep contact st least but constantly misgendering me saying her he them! Every times she needs to gender a word. And the whole losing a daughter crap... today I legit yelled back at her im not dead and I wont put up with hearing u talk about me as if I am. Pfff. I dunno. Long game? She finally started telling her friends im trans this week so maybe things will sink in eventually. If you can dont put up with it and call her out. Way before i came out and trans issues entered the family I had a very close and honest relationship with my parents that was based on not being afraid to be authentic and actually share my life with them. It meant we had a good few years of fighting but we ended up actually knowing each other by the time i became an adult. I think its gonna be the same now for me and it might be for you as well and the key to not letting that ruin the relationship but help build it is to not be afraid to force her into true acceptance not let her off the hook and put the work in yourself to share even when its hard so that she has a better understanding of how things seem from behind your and my eyes. Or just say fuck all and stop caring. We dont need to support the people supportive of us. So if you cant handle this just try to find ur zen elsewhere. ,ftm,de51hri,4,t5_2t9mw

11055167,0,t1_del22cn,gtAFAIK Riki Wilchins the author of the article is a trans woman so the article isnt the result of transmasculine transmisogyny...I would love to know how this follows. It seems like youre saying because shes a trans woman she is immune from transmasculine transmysogyny which I parse as meaning misogyny against a trans man which is a thing. Im either missing something there or parsing the phrase wrong. One of the biggest pitfalls to using a bunch of specialized words smashed together the way we tend to lol.On the other hand how often has a trans man been raped or abused because they were perceived as a butch lesbian? How many have never come forward with their abuses because of shame or fear same reasons as cis guys dont actually? How many trans men have been murdered then misgendered after death?I am not trying to erase the fact that trans women face a large amount of violence against them. I am trying to point out that we simply dont have a very good set of numbers relating to the violence trans men face for the very same reason the public gets so shocked to learn we exist each time  we have a visibility problem. People dont admit or realize or care we exist. So we arent counted until we force ourselves to the fore as with the examples in the article.But that isnt a form of activism for trans women. Its a form of activism for all trans people and needs to be treated as such. To do otherwise is to ignore and erase the struggles and dangers we guys face  again. And as Ive said Im tired of being treated like an invisble person within my own community. I exist damnit. My fears and the prejudices against me matter too.

In my country its not unusual to see someone never get help for this stuff because its so looked down upon just the way LGBT is.Im still being deadnamed and misgendered at home by everyone but my mother I legally changed everything a year ago and people still dont even bother and for a moment I just thought Well fuck me. Just another day. But then it scared me I was so willing to just give up defending who I am and realized that no this is WRONG. I couldnt even tell my dad straight on that today has nothing to do with me because Im a man. I couldnt speak out Im a man. to him. I find it so much harder to explain this to a man than to a woman because they just dismiss me. My halfbrothers and stepdad refuse to acknowledge my identity but my mother is OK with it.Overall I think the people in my life invalidating my identity are more worried about their own asses and being looked down upon if others find out who I am.  My family is religious and so is my father so this getting out means others are gonna see me as the spawn of Satan and the whole family is shamed. lol If I went back to visit my dad in my country and people saw me changed they will spread nasty rumors about him or blame it on him. Its just the way people are in my country sadly. If my father knew that my name and last name were changed Im sure he would have a heart attack. Its very hard to talk to someone so sensitive so I wouldnt be surprised if he suddenly thought Maybe he forgot and turned back into a girl! because he is trying so hard to deny the reality and it probably comes back to bite him in the ass for example when I talk to him because my voice changed completely since T.,ftm,deo6nit,5,t5_2t9mw

Yes I have had to shut down family members with science.A review of the literature shows multiple studies that have shown  trans people on testosterone have an increase in positive mood not negative mood   both cis  men with low T AND cis men with normal T do not have increased anger aggression or irritability with T up to three times what I take on top of their already higher T levels multiple studies see references below  only one study found that cis men taking gtmg weekly doses top of their normal levels for multiple months found increased irritability in only  of people. That is with an order of magnitude more testosterone than many trans men  of people had no negative mood changes.  Studies on mood in men treated with injectable testosteronemgml per week in cis men on top of endogenous levels no effect on mood mgml per week in cis men on top of endogenous levels no effect on mood  especially aggression mgml per week in cis men on top of endogenous levels found DECREASED negative  mood  and DECREASED aggression These data do not support the hypothesis that supraphysiological levels of T within this range lead to an increase in self and partnerreported aggression or mood disturbanceHypogonadal adolescents given T supplementation no effect on mood,ftm,dewayk9,6,t5_2t9mw

11183710,0,t1_dezmpv4,Absolutely true.  However there are some expectations and limitations that parents are much much more likely to impose on the children they see as girls.  Other sets of expectations and limitations are much much more likely to be imposed on children seen as boys.Still these things will be mixed and matched in individual families and different communities.I definitely know cis guys that were encouraged to have traditionally female perspectives and behaviors.  They are different from guys whose parents never had such expectations of them.  The former group is definitely a smaller group. They are just as much men and while they are cis I think I could say they had a degree of female socialization in the sense that their socialization is more common for female children.The term probably should be femaletypical socialization.  However I think its generally understood that were really talking about that.Despite the fact that socialization like so many many things! is a spectrum we know there are two ends to that spectrum.  And we know where those ends generally intersect with the sex of kids.,ftm,deznslq,6,t5_2t9mw

11236536,0,t1_df5m9ci,Dude talk to your parents and tell them that youre struggling with postop depression. You dont have to tell them the deepest darkest thoughts. Just that you need some help. Theyve gotten you this far. They shouldnt begrudge you that. I dont know much about antidepressants but I know there are a few options. You could ask for something different. You could also try vitamin d supplements and one of those light machines. You could ask to get seen by a psychiatrist instead of either your normal doc or therapist. That way youre not upsetting anyone and you get the help you need. My therapist would probably encourage me to ask myself who is trapping you? And lead me down the road of realizing that I was predicting reactions instead of giving them the benefit of the doubt. Love yourself the way your parents love you and get the care you need. Pretend youre me looking at your story. What would you tell a random redditor? I bet youd say a lot of the same things Ive just said. Apologies for ramble its way past my bedtime. No offense meant anywhere not trying to force or guilt you into anything. Ignore me if Im annoying etc etc.,ftm,df5n97q,4,t5_2t9mw

11250423,0,t1_df6eru2,Yes this is one of the coolest but also saddest things about my transition to me. Cool because I always wanted this sad because the fact that it changed so much means that guys didnt accept me earlier in life which I didnt really realize until I started to pass.Slight tangent This was also one of the worst things about coming back from studying abroad  I went abroad just as I started to pass at  months on T made guy friends I was stealth to for the first time and who I felt fully accepted me as one of them and then came back to my home school at around  months where I struggle to fit in with the guys because I feel they see me differently.

Being able to provide for my family. My voice is not remotely masculine so I cant even pass on the phone.  The best thing is just feeling comfortable with myself like this is who I am. Also I like mens haircuts. The worst thing is all the stuff youre not supposed to do as a guy like Zumba. This one is hard for me to answer because I am  and preeverything so I cant even imagine being stealth. I guess Id worry about getting hit by a car. I dont have a whole lot of wisdom acquired since Ive been out to myself for only a few months and out to everyone else for just a couple of months. I would say that if it seems overwhelming step back and ask simple questions like what do I want to be called? and what do I want to wear? Focusing on smaller things can help shift perspective.

11384537,0,t1_dfmdbc3,Blockers are something that I would look into actually.  Theres really no risks and if your kid realizes that theyre not a dude stopping blockers would mean that estrogenfueled puberty would continue as normal.  If your kid remains comfortable identifying as a dude blockers can help reduce or eliminate dysphoria by stopping estrogenfueled puberty and allowing them to go throw just a testosteronefueled puberty and if they dont have a lot of breast growth may allow them to not need or desire surgery to get a masculine chest.I do agree that it is probably too early for your kid to immediately jump onto testosterone for HRT both because of the possibility that theyre still sorting out their identity and also because of age is on the early side of things for puberty for dudes and your kid may still have some growing to do.,ftm,dfmf21q,6,t5_2t9mw

My parents had always said they would pay for my college tuition if I decide to go study in the USA. However now they are saying that they will only pay if I am accepted in x place and theres only a  chance thatll happen. If it does happen thatll be really cool because Ill have financial support but it probably wont so Im planning for that.gtDo you have family or friends in the states who might be more open and accepting of you than your parents that might be willing to give you a place to stay at least initially and help you look for a job or if not stay at least let you use their address for a mailing address for applications?Yes I have friends. I cant live in their house but they will allow me to write down their address in the job application.I also have a smartphone and will be taking my six year old laptop with me. I am moving to LA which is known for its hot climate so I wont need coatsjackets. Also I have noticed they have LGBT centers and a shelter for homeless LGBT youth to live. Do you think they could help me find a job? Im not really sure what LGBT centers do as there is none in my country.I will be looking for a minimum wage job something in  a supermarketretail.gtDo you know the symptoms of hypothermia and heat exhaustionheat stroke and dehydration? Those are things I really recommend knowing just in general but especially if youre living on your own on the streets because those are things that are generally fairly easily remedied but can also become lifethreatening fast if theyre not identified doubly so because hypothermia heat strokeexhaustion and dehydration often include disorientation and unclear thinking as part of the symptoms.I actually am aware of this! We were taught all this survival things in high school.gtAre you parents going to let you leave or is there a risk that they may try to prevent you from leaving by hiding your identity documents from you or trying to commit you to a psych ward?I like to think they will let me leave.

Prolly not right?Would you wear a swimsuit in the middle of a park or on the street with no single pool of water around?The difference between your exemple and mine is the context.As for gym shorts and such with the exception of sports where they need to minimise windwater resistance such as cycle races or swimming wearing tight pants is not something many men do especially if they carry around a subway sandwich on their crotch for it is extremely uncomfortable  and actually hurts in certain positionsif friction occurs especially if circumcised.,ftm,dfyw57z,2,t5_2t9mw

11571091,0,t1_dg7jhd0,I like the idea of perpetuating that term purely to ensure that this fuckface milowannabe can never live this shit down.It just occurred to me as Im writing this that maybe gay cis men accuse trans men of being deceitful as well as straight cis men saying the same about trans women because of a sense of entitlement. A lot of cis men tend to feel entitled to sex and when the object of their affection doesnt have the genitalia theyre expecting he feels cheated. Whether or not the object of their affection knew they were interested in them sexually or returned the interest is irrelevant to the cis man he feels the sense that hes lost out on his potential lay and becomes resentful because hes been told all his life that he has a right to bang whoever he thinks is attractive. To add insult to injury discovering his conquests trans status makes him feel like his sexual orientation an integral part of his own identity is being invalidated or threatened. Even if a man has not personally experienced the surprise of discovering their crush is trans the thought could probably be enough to color a mans perception of trans people.TLDR My thought is that if someone says trans people are deceitful you have to ask well what are your intentions if you would feel deceived that someones genitals dont meet your expectations?,ftm,dg7l7rk,12,t5_2t9mw

11677487,0,t3_66lv18,Disclaimer Im a Canadian nonlinguistThe first link is especially relevant. While pitch has an impact in the perception of gender there are phonetic differences in the way men and women speak. Keep in mind that prepubescent boys are generally not gendered female somehow. For trans people this will be the bane of your existence. Women pronounce s consonants at a higher pitch than men do. They also use clear L more often whereas men tend to use dark L. Google cleardark L listen to the difference. Consonant pitch in general seems to be a factor I suspect the same goes for the pitch of t. Keep in mind that s and t are unvoiced consonants. Nonetheless consonant pitch is influenced by the placement of speech in the mouth and breathier farther forward more precise tense speech in general seems to be stereotypically female. Theres also a vowel difference at least from what I can hear. The Canadian shift seems to be more pronounced in men in general and I suspect that this is similar elsewhere wherever you are men always have folksier lessposhsounding accents.  Also this is bloody fucking hard to unlearn even if you grew up never really being girly this stuff gets pretty ingrained.,ftm,dgjnrai,4,t5_2t9mw

11728879,0,t1_dgpfopl,Transition isnt a one size fits all and its irresponsible to say to someone You arent post transition because X. Their transition may include or omit steps that were I cluded or omitted for yourself. Its essentially telling someone Youre not transitioning correctly. While I have a few weeks left before top surgery I feel that I am posttransition because I am socially treated how I want to be treated and except for being nervous about top surgery I dont typically experience dysphoria. Theres nothing that Im transitioning into Im there people act like Im male etc. I have many queer friends and I talk with them frequently but I dont have internet at my house yay sharing  gigs of data between four phone lines so I dont consume as much media as I otherwise am able or would. I think theres a fundamental difference between us however because I dont want to be celebrated because Im trans. I want it to be as mildly uninteresting and nonissue as having a peanut allergy something to be mindful of but nothing that makes people think the world is ending. Im not looking for treatment options I wanted to hear from people whose experiences mimic or mimicked mine. I meshed well with both of the therapists Ive worked with but I ultimately found that it wasnt useful to me. Theres nothing wrong with that. Me finding it unproductive and boring to talk about My Feelings with someone I dont know who might have ulterior motives but probably doesnt but probably is trying really hard to fix me doesnt mean its not useful to other people. It just means that it isnt useful to me. I appreciate that you took the time to comment but I wasnt really looking for advice and I apologize if I sound defensive or dismissive. I dont see many people talking about depression after theyve reached major milestones and look great so I went actively looking for people. It would make the load more bearable to know that Im not alone in this rather than have advice about things that I try to do such as improve my selfesteem and selfimage which has been slowly working only to continue to feel apathetic and unhappy. ,ftm,dgphz3s,1,t5_2t9mw
