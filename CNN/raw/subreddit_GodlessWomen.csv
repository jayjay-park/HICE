4938029,0,t1_cugwgru,Oh  yes.  The Bible is only hard on masturbators technically if theyre supposed in the story to be bringing up a child for their dead relative and jack off to avoid doing so.  Im sure that someone has interpreted that as all spilling of seed being wrong but in the context its more of like lying and not fulfilling a promise.Its definitely down on whores tho!  Whores are like the no.  source of lifes problems or something.I guess my upbringing was similar but slightly theologically different from these folks.  Basically for us the woman was  at fault almost all the time.  So no matter what the guy did it was never really him  it was always somehow because of women if any women at all could be connected to the sin.It feels like giving him too much credit to speculate that he was thinking of anything but his own weiner in these situations.  Even in the ugliest sexist parts of my experience with Christianity it was never like... better to sexually abuse a child than your wife.  You wife was kind of there to sexually abuse.,GodlessWomen,cugz82g,4,t5_2t6l7
