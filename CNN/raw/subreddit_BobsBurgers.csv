In the past its been entirely because of baseball this year there was no game on Fox though Fox had the rights to NLCS game  which aired at that time they did so on Fox Sports  so Id assume that they had the episode schedule determined months or possibly even years ago based on the baseball schedules. Chances are likely they aired a new episode of the Simpsons because they knew it would still gather viewers on an irregular schedule. ,BobsBurgers,cl9i4g1,1,t5_2s9k9

3643521,0,t3_320qv2,I sure cant complain because my absolute favorite character is stuck in school centric episodes Mr. Frond.I find school less to be the problem and more...JUST how kid centric the show has become. In earlier episodes there was a nice balance between kids and adults. Spaghetti Western and Meatballs and Synchronized Swimming both integrated school into their storylines while also having it so Bob and Linda could play a big part as well. Everyone felt involved and no one felt pushed aside to an irrelevant Bplot. Everything tied together.I find myself more annoyed at the ever expanding kid group...Like. Okay. The Belchers sure! MAAAAYBE the Pestos and Zeke if theyre actually doing something but whenever they shove Jocelyn Rudy or Peter Pescadero onscreen its just...ugh! Theyre not distinct in my opinion. They usually deliver one liners and theyre really just not adding anything. If they want us to love these characters they should give us a reason to instead of insisting we like them by making them appear so frequently. Itd be better if they tried to expand on each kid separately.So yeah school centric episodes dont bother me as much as the useless kid characters. I have enjoyed them thoroughly because of Mr. Fronds appearances. It sorta feels to me theyre just doing school episodes to mess with him since he always feels the most characterized...but I might just be biased here.I do hope for Bob and Linda to get their time to shine again. I just assume this seasons so kid heavy because theyre the reason the show is so popular. If it makes you feel any better the script covers for season six look a whole lot less school centric. Not a single seemingly school episode out of the  titles we know  if My Dinner with Frondre is season six...which is one school ep out of the  we know.,BobsBurgers,cq7l6wn,5,t5_2s9k9
