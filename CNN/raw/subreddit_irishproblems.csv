1270488,0,t1_cicjjrq,Its fairly depressing and disheartening but its important to keep telling yourself that everything you do ads to your experience. There must be courses or the like near you that you could do to keep yourself occupied? Everything you can add to your list helps and aside from that theres nothing worse for your mental health than doing nothing.I feel you though buddy! I hope something comes up for you soon. Dont lose hope ,irishproblems,cicjp33,2,t5_2tphj
