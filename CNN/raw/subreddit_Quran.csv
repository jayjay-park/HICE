9407760,0,t1_d98hyuz,Abraham Mention in the scripture Abraham he was a saint a prophet. He said to his father O my father why do you worship what can neither hear nor see nor help you in any way? O my father I have received certain knowledge that you did not receive. Follow me and I will guide you in a straight path. O my father do not worship the devil. The devil has rebelled against the Most Gracious. O my father I fear lest you incur retribution from the Most Gracious then become an ally of the devil. He said Have you forsaken my gods O Abraham? Unless you stop I will stone you. Leave me alone. He said Peace be upon you. I will implore my Lord to forgive you He has been Most Kind to me. I will abandon you and the gods you worship besides GOD. I will worship only my Lord. By imploring my Lord alone I cannot go wrong. Because he abandoned them and the gods they worshiped beside GOD we granted him Isaac and Jacob and we made each of them a prophet. We showered them with our mercy and we granted them an honorable position in history.Moses Mention in the scripture Moses. He was devoted and he was a messenger prophet. We called him from the right side of Mount Sinai. We brought him close to confer with him. And we granted him out of our mercy his brother Aaron as a prophet. And mention in the scripture Ismail. He was truthful when he made a promise and he was a messenger prophet. He used to enjoin his family to observe the Contact Prayers Salat and the obligatory charity Zakat he was acceptable to his Lord. And mention in the scripture Idrs. He was a saint a prophet. We raised him to an honorable rank. These are some of the prophets whom GOD blessed. They were chosen from among the descendants of Adam and the descendants of those whom we carried with Noah and the descendants of Abraham and Israel and from among those whom we guided and selected. When the revelations of the Most Gracious are recited to them they fall prostrate weeping.,Quran,d98hzw5,1,t5_2qjk9
