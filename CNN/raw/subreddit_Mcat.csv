3513577,0,t3_300se2,Studying the material is not that bad. Its just a bunch of vocab words with pretty simple concepts. THe material primarily comes from the first  intro psych classes that all our schools have offered. Thats the good news...The bad news is that ive been doing some psych practice sections and the passages are almost all based on experiments and studies done in the past. You have to be able to quickly analyze their data which is usually in a table or some type of graph and be able to infer different conclusions that the experimenters might make based on the data. Sometimes youre even asked the why? questions and based ont he theories and concepts of psychsoc you have to choose the correct answer. What im saying might not seem difficult and its not but there are just soo many logical answers thats its hard to eliminate the  answer choices to just . What I recommend you do is quickly within several days go through all the psychsoc material and begin taking practice sections. From there youll be able to decide what youre stong on and what youre wak on.

In preparation for my second time I did many many passages but it obviously didnt help. I also did what many people have suggested and tried to figure out why I got a question wrong. Overall these tactics did not help me. I am taking the mcat a third time and I think what is useful is finding a tutor that is an expert in verbal. They understand how the exam works and what to watch out for. Getting a tutor isnt required but it has helped me. They are expensive so it isnt an option for everyone.

4334933,0,t3_3afk9q,Reddit has been super helpful in reading other peoples posts and realizing that I am not alone so I thought I would try to give advice.Took it Saturday June .I took TPR Kaplan and NextStep practice tests and honestly  ALL of them are so much harder than the actual examAAMC FL exam. Please take this into consideration when you are studying.ChemPhys  My version was heavy on physics concepts which I was surprised about because physics seemed so underemphasized on everything that I have encountered. Make sure you know your amino acids properties pKas oneletter abbreviations threeletter abbreviations side chains structures. I dont remember if there was any significant orgo on my test but orgo is one of my strongest subjects and I think you tend to remember the topics that you found most difficult. During the test prep practice exams I would always finish with  minute left and on the AAMC FL I finished with  minutes left. But on the real exam I finished with  minutes left. Im not sure if that is any evidence of difficultydiscrepancy.CARS  Going into studying this was probably the section I was most worried about. But I honestly read all of the strategies in TPR and Kaplan and I actually applied them and did many many practice passages while doing content review for the other sections. I really really advise this. In terms of materiallengthdifficulty it was very similar to the AAMC FL.Bio  This was the only section that was much harder than the AAMC FL in my opinion. There was physiology biochemistry and molecular biology. It really covered all of the bases and I was very taken aback by that because I was expecting a very biochemistryfocused section. Please please study and dont expect that you will only receive biochemistry questions. Definitely brush up on EVERYTHING.PsychSoc  I love psych and soc and I actually do psychology research but honestly AAMC needs to better define what is going to be on this exam because the test prep books all cover different things and even AAMC just throws in random curveballs at times. I didnt think TPR prepared me well enough and there were many questions that I only got correct because I have taken many psychsoc classes and I do research. I dont know how to give advice on how to study for this section except just know your terms familiarize yourself with psych articles its usually always going to be experimental understand psych research they like to ask questions about ethics methodology etc.. This section is literally just going to be ... you either know it or you dont. I finished with like  minutes and I just retook the entire section two more times before ending my test early. Because honestly you really cant just guess on a terms definition. Like a lot of the questions that are paired with passages are really discrete questions because they ask for term definitions. So just make sure you brush up on your terms. ,Mcat,cse9yn6,4,t5_2saxp

Can you imagine without nurses doctors would have to constantly check the vitals of patients which would probably cause an extreme disparity of doctors without EMTs doctors would have to go get the patients themselves and without social workers doctors would have to check the mental and social wellbeing of patients themselves everyone has a vital role in healthcare. As for the integrity of social workers you may have forgotten about the recent VA Hospital scandal that involved a social worker who still has her job or the various scandals you can find done by social workers by doing a quick google search there will always be a bad group of people in any field ranging from medical institutions to even religious institutionsdoesnt mean every single person in that field is bad or corrupt. ,Mcat,csjorq7,0,t5_2saxp

4462682,0,t1_cssz1hx,gtI usually only do this for passages that bring up a lot of history. For example is there is an author thats describing a tradition or cultural phenomena and using various historical references to prove their point then I will try to summarize each paragraph to know specifically what that historical perspective contributes to the authors argument. Only do this if there are too many convoluted sources the author is using to prove their point and if you have plenty of time left to do this. I also do this with speeches since there is a lot of allegory comparisons and historical references made during these.So it does sound like you do this during the time you are doing this while you are writing the passage. It does sound like it can be helpful under certain circumstances though. I know what you mean about historical passages where they throw a lot of examples at you. Especially when there are questions that ask which statement is least supported its probably helpful to make note of certain contributions to an authors argument.gtCurrently starting out with TPRH  Verbal which I should be done with soon since Im doing  per day. Then Im moving on to the NS CARS passages in their CARS book. Then I will be doing the EK  Verbal. After the EK  Verbal I will be doing the AAMC CARS Vol. and Vol. and then finally ending with the Khan Academy CARS Passages.Ah okay Im currently looking into more practise material and was hoping for some opinions on the other stuff out there aside from EK. Ive read about varying difficulties between verbal practise material and how it compares to the real MCAT but with the new section excluding scientific passages its harder to gauge what is now reputable. ,Mcat,cst77g3,1,t5_2saxp

I personally believe the best way to improve your score is by identifying and minimizing the systematic logical errors you may be making instead of trying to memorize your way to a good score. This can only be done through taking a lot of full length practice tests. I recommend EK  and NS . If youre on a budget try EK  and NS . This approach really paid off for me got a  on the june exam but I suppose you should take it with a grain of salt since everyone is different!OFFICIAL FL performance If you can hit above  on each of the sections youre in a really strong place.

The greater your resistance is the less current flows through your wire if we keep voltage constant because of of  V IR. From the equation we can see that resistance R and current I are inversely proportional. So as resistance increases...current will decrease.

It is more important for you to get your primary in and verified day one and your secondaries done before your scores are released so you can be complete asap. But yeah you do want to have up to date LORs. Is there any way you can keep in contact with your professors over the year? Ask them if theyre ok with writing a letter for you next year now and maintain contact with them perhaps send them updates maybe ask to do research with them to maintain a relationship?. I am now three years removed from one of my professors but he was more than happy to write me a letter...of course I do research with him so that helps maintain the relationship. Hope this helps!

6182971,0,t3_406mp8,Im late to the party but I agree with C because of the law of conservation of energy. Kinetic and potentialFormula for energy conservation .mv  mgh  .mvfinal  mghfinal I would solve for big block then compare with small block solving for hfinal. Arbitrary numbers for easy calculations Mass big block Mass small blockInitial velocity Final velocity Initial heightBoth blocks have same initial and final velocities because they are launched at the same time and eventually will stop mid air and fall. They both have same initial height because they are both on the spring. Here kinetic energy is completely transferred to potential energy making it easy to solve. With my random numbers you plug and chug and for the big block end up with . whatever units you want and for the small block . units. They have the same final height therefore mass doesnt matter and C is the answer. Note energy of the big block is not the same as the small block but the net total energy is because its  because conservation of energy says initial energy equals final energy kineticpotentialenergy Someone say if Im wrong!

An external attribution would be like getting angry when someone cuts you off on the road. Youre not an angry person normally lack of consistency your environment caused the the emotion. An external locus on the control on the other hand has more to do with how people perceive the events of their life. They think they are not in control and that their actions are not their fault. An example of this would be a student who does poorly on a test blaming their poor performance on their teacher.

If you want to practise this skill I would highly recommend the new AAMC section banks. They can be really difficult but I felt they prepared me much better than anything else out there the bio section especially. Just dont do them all at once and try to learn from your mistakes. Also if you have the time I would do as many of the Khan Academy bio passages as you can. Try to pick ones that have lots of graphs or seem convoluted.

6981763,0,t3_4bb8u5,Symbolic interactionism is an INDIVIDUAL actually INTERACTING with someone or something. This leaves an impression on that person which will subsequently change or maintain their beliefs about that particular interaction.Lets view an example  You absolutely love your vegetables. They make you so happy and every single time you see them or interact with them eat cook etc. it strengthens your perception about them  it makes you love them even more. Interactions can change over time.You and your best friend always hang out. Whenever you go there you like to snoop around while its his turn on the PS. As youre snooping you notice that your friends mom always has cucumbers in her nightstand. This instantly makes you feel disgusted at the sight of certain vegetables but specifically cucumbers. This interaction has changed YOUR perception of someone i.e. his mom and something i.e. cucumbers.Keep in mind Symbolic interactionism has  components  you give everything meaning through interactions  someone can have different and even opposite perceptions about the same thing since its dependent on THEIR interactions and  interactions can change over time through the compounding of interactions. I apologize for the vulgar example but I bet you wont forget it.Social Constructionism is a different. This works on a SOCIETAL level. This only exist because we give them a meaning. It can be broken down into weak social constuctionism WSC and strong social constructionism SSC. WSC depends on two principles there are brute facts or facts that cannot be explained by anything else i.e. quarks gravity etc. and institutional facts or facts that exist solely because we as a society gave it a meaning i.e. money. SSC differs in that they only believe in institutional facts. They argue that things that are brute facts can still be explained. Quarks for instance exist because we looked for them made up the idea etc. Both WSC and SSC have trouble explaining natural phenomenon since as the definition implies are out of human societal creation.,Mcat,d17pzt8,5,t5_2saxp

BLASPHEMY! MADNESS! OCHEM!Lots of factors determine who is the winner in the SN vs E battle for  dominance but I hope this makes it a little more clear in predicting the winner.  In these cases. Bulky bases favor E.  This goes back to good ol steric hinderance.  Nuc that are small can easily penetrate the sexy electrophiles back door with such force that her hair extensions to cant even hold on. However bulky Nucs are so pleasantly plump they just cant get it in.  Out of frustration they steal her purse but she fights back causing the strap to snap back and whip her eye clear out of the socket.. Stronger bases favor E. Bases are like crack addicts.  Strong bases know their strength and realize they are stable when they get a hit of the rock.  They are so strong and addicted they will often grab a pipe right out of another weak addicts mouth.  On the other hand still strong but slightly weaker addicts will often feel inferior to the really strong addicts and instead of grabbing the pipe directly they will punch the other guy in the gut and knock the sugar stick right out of their mouth..

That answer is wrong in the context of the question because if RB is pulled down and is found to complex with lysosomal memrane proteins for example then you satisfy the condition that the assay tells you about RBs localization in the cell.rb transcripts havent been translated yet and so doesnt tell you anything about where the mature protein will end up in the cell.For  you are just expected to know that dimerization interfaces between proteins are often mediated via hydrophobic interactions.

7384130,0,t3_4gg6x2,i personally think its pointless to prep for the exam this early. the tiny details that you need to remember will all but be gone by the time you study for real. i took the mcat  years ago and got a great score but it expired and i had to take it again. i remembered nothing from my previous study session and i had spent a good  months memorizing everything.your brain may work differently and have better retention than me. i tend to pick things up quick but forget it quick once i dont need it anymore.i will say that it keeps your mind active which is never a bad thing. my brain was in a pretty bad fog after undergrad derealization disorder which is mentioned in the psych section haha. studying and memorizing really helped clear that up a bit. basically im just trying to say it wont realistically help you for your mcat unless you constantly review it all the way up to the exam to prevent forgetting it all. but its better than watching shit tv all day and letting your brain rot metaphorically speaking of course haha.,Mcat,d2hixdn,1,t5_2saxp

7462723,0,t3_4hjthd,It depends on what youre looking for.  Kaplans inperson course really emphasizes testtaking strategies.  If I had known that I might not have sprung for the inperson course  I know Im a good test taker and what I thought I really wanted was a learning environment to put my nose to the grindstone and force me to focus for a few hours a week.  That didnt really happen.  Of the weekly  hour class  minutes would be on super fast content review  hrs and  minutes would be on strategies for analyzing passages and attacking questions.I ended up learning some solid CARS strategies and the classroomstyle setting helped me feel a little more organized about my prep I think.  The real learning for me didnt start until I had to postpone my test originally January  because I hadnt been studying enough.  I chose Kaplans free take the course again option but never went in to the inperson sessions I just used their online content practice tests and emailed questions to my old Kaplan teacher.  Their content is very well organized and makes it easy to track your progress.I wont say their content was the best  I liked Khans videos better.  Kaplans video performers are hit or miss.  Some of their voices are SO grating.  But the organization of their content felt so incredibly thorough that I stayed motivated by feeling that if I just hit my dailyweekly goals for hours spent  modules completed by the time I was done I would be an expert on everything  or at least I would have seen everything once.  That proved to be a powerful feeling for me.  I felt like I was becoming an expert.  ,Mcat,d2qgrlp,1,t5_2saxp

Prep courses will be focusing on content review while youd ideally want to spend that last month doing practice testspassages. You should already have a general understanding of all the content by the last month. Personally I wouldnt do the prep course at all. I guess it gives you structure but if you think youd be able to keep yourself accountable just save the money and study from the books you havewatch khan for anything you dont understand. EK th edition is good for everything except for biochem and ps. Also the orgo section is probably too brief. Everything else is covered pretty well.

7703710,0,t1_d3hfv89,I think A. can be taken as more factually  if ambiguous in context  true because E reactions DO occur most readily with tertiary alcohols than others. If they were to have gone with the more contextually factual statement that the reaction occurs most readily with secondary alcohols  then thats contextually accurate but factually ambiguous because we know somewhat that its not technically true since tertiary carbocations are more stable that secondary  and thats the slow step of E. Though I guess they could have circumvented this by changing the answer choice to The reaction occurs more readily with secondary alcohols than primary.I think the deliberate wording they used with most rather than more is significant here. It implies that the question is testing us on our ability to identify the dehydration described within the passage as E and then testing us on our ability to extrapolate from that to describe the characteristics of E reactions.

I was really fatigued I know I missed some questions that I shouldve gotten and I wanted to cry.  I think part of the reason is that I finished the sections with time to spare so I spent A LOT of time going over questions I was unsure about so that can really mess with your confidence.  I will say that Princeton Review is a lot harder and more detailed than the actual exam. My confidence shot up after I took the AAMC material but I do believe that the REAL test is a bit more difficult than the AAMC practice material. I suggest that you spend less time reading entire review books just read major topics that you know will be on the test amino acids hormones etc. and then spend most of your study time taking whole practice tests IN ONE SITTING if possible and then watch Khan academy youtube videos and read about topics that you seem to have a hard time with. I took an online TPR class and I regretted spending all that money I maybe only watched half the lectures and did half the homework because I had schoolwork too but I just needed the tests tbh.    Edit After reading some comments about the May th test I have to agree that the physical sciences and maybe the bio part felt oddly specific and more difficult.

8044616,0,t1_d4iw1d5,Fear is a very strong motivator lol. First I started watching the Khan Academy videos on biomolecules and organ systems a couple months before my MCAT class even began since I was pretty weak on all that and had never take physiology. I intended to get through all the videos but was no where close. You should be able to find my notes from those somewhere on this subreddit... like a google drive or something? Im not really sure tbh but PM me if you want them. MCAT class started and was pretty thorough content review for . months with an emphasis on lots of practice problems. Started taking practice tests when only about half done with content review one a week until a few weeks before the test and then I started doing  a week. In the month before the exam I took off work and basically isolated myself but in a supportive environment and treated studying like a full time job. Never really went back through class notes but in between taking and reviewing practice exams I did spend HOURS going through the AAMC outline and writing down everything that I wasnt  confident with. Which was a lot of things.So overall enough content that I didnt feel super uncomfortable with a lot of the test and theres no way to get around knowing those physics formulas cold but there was a lot I didnt know. Lots of practice passages and practices tests taught me I was much more likely to miss a question from not reading or understanding the passage correctly rather than not knowing a cold hard fact. So I did a disgusting amount of practice passages and exams from a variety of sources  overall  TPR FLs  Kaplan FLs  EK FLs  Gold Standard FL and their half test diagnostic and  Next Step FL and their half diagnostic. Plus all the AAMC material  two full lengths section banks etc. Worth also mentioning that I tried to stay in a good mindset and beat away my tendency to freak out about these sorts of things by meditating every day for a couple months leading up to the exam. My biggest fear was that I would get a notgreat to mediocre score back and think damn. I wish I . or If only I . I felt not very prepared a month before the test in fact I was supposed to take May th but rescheduled so I put off everything I possibly could for those few weeks to study  just so I could walk in to the test and know that I did pretty much everything possible. ,Mcat,d4kahm3,1,t5_2saxp

I did have a lot of review under my belt from tutoring classmates during university so I spent not too much time on it. However I liked the Kaplan books but have no other real experience with other resources other than Khan Academy. Kaplan is very thorough and does introduce information which may only rarely come up but if its on the MCAT I would say its in their book. I think their FL are also a little on the low scoring side as I never did amazingly in them but I liked them more than PR because PR seemed to try to trick you a lot on wording or small details which the actual exam doesnt have. Kaplan is instead a little content heavy which I actually liked.,Mcat,d4s284o,2,t5_2saxp

However Ive also seen that the two hormones only act on one or the other segment of the nephron. I have found more consensus about their function.ADH increases the movement of aquaporins to the surface which are channels that promote water reabsorption increasing blood pressure but lowering osmolarity.Aldosterone increases the active absorption of Na and subsequently HO. K secretion is also increased as Na and K are exchanged by the transporter. The net effect is an increase in blood pressure with no change in blood osmolarity.,Mcat,d4z49ad,1,t5_2saxp

I know most of the material but only have it about half mastered. CARS is always my weakest mostly because of time and I found it really hard to improve that score.Taking the AAMC FL I felt I did ok though I did not go back and review my answers once I was done with a section. Besides the CARS I usually had about  minutes left over for each section. I just dont know where to start with going over my answers. Do I focus on the ones I am struggling with or rather the ones I felt were too easy? The part I hate the most is the straight forward questions that I find easy only to realize I made a dumb mistake. Forgetting to change R to S with SNThere were a few physics areas that I am weak on and now I am kind of triaging which equations are must know and which I am just going to have to take a hit on ie trig. I reviewed all week but the complex passages with gene expression enzymes and proteins tend to trip me up. I also needed to review all the different types of testing again PAGE Blot tests and spectroscopy in order to better my interpretation of results. Ive decided to dive right in tomorrow. I am going to just apply to a couple schools who will consider me seriously with the score of  and then wait for my score to be released before applying to the rest of the schools on my list. That way I am not wasting time and  applying to schools that wont give me the time of day. Up until a week ago I had so much confidence.

And of course any time I wasnt  sure I remembered what the passage had said Id glance back over. The passage is always there on the left side of your screen so going back and forth is easy. Like usnatchypig said dont try and memorize everything when youre reading it.

8313572,0,t3_4tcoby,Honestly? ZOLOFT. I have bad anxiety anyway and stated getting treated recently Ive been taking it for about a month. Im starting to see effects like before if I was thinking about the MCAT at night I would get to anxious I wouldnt be able to sleep this was like still three weeks out and Id be up until  AM.Obviously Im on SSRIs for reasons also unrelated to test anxiety but it is helping.Besides that I have an anxiety workbook that has strategies for coping with shit. It recommends practicing deep breathing for  minutes every day. When you start to panic the idea is that by breathing slowly and deeply it can help attenuate your SNS response. YMMV. Also things like exercise eating healthy etc. I feel like when Im physically well Im more able to handle my mental issues.I also definitely agree with uqqgt  Whenever I would get one of those questions that seemed so intimidating and insanely difficult I kept asking myself what makes this an easy question? Usually the hard looking questions are actually asking for something quite simple if you can figure it out. That and amplifying my confidence really helped me to not get too nervous.It might be hard to step back when your stress response is bugging but if you can internalize this and that worst case scenario you have to retake which is not as big a deal as a lot of neurotic premeds make it out to be you might be able to get in control.Also know youre not alone. I feel calmer than normal now but Im sure Ill be bugging when my test gets closer. Make sure you have a good IRL support system  my boyfriend has been awesome for that. You got this OH OH OH also if you can avoid caffeine. In my experience if my anxiety is going to be bad anyway caffeine makes things a LOT fucking worse for me. It can help pump some people up but it can make things like test anxiety terrible to deal with. Again YMMV but something to consider unless you really need it,Mcat,d5gr4ac,1,t5_2saxp

Read the EK CARS lecture book very helpful strats and apply it to the old VR sections I found this helped hammer in the importance of the main idea. I like you have done about the same on  NS exams  area and just realized that most of the questions could be solved by internalizing the main idea which I was NOT doing.Best of luck keep practicing and try and get through all the AAMC CARS if you can.premedcal has great advice too,Mcat,d60bbf3,1,t5_2saxp
8480281,0,t1_d61anp9,This is somewhat true.  You can have more Ochem passages but some questions can classify as either Ochem Biochem or General Chemistry depending on how the AAMC feels.  If I got asked a question about the Pka of an AA that could be either GC or BC which essentially makes up  of the test.  Same thing goes for a reaction with a carbonyl and a AA that can count as Ochem or BC or even GC.Thermo can be either Physics GC OC or BC depending on the question as well so Im going to disagree with this.Since many of the topics overlap what may feel like an Ochem heavy test may actually be an Ochem heavy test.  Took it twice and some tests were definitely heavier in certain areas.,Mcat,d61ku1o,0,t5_2saxp

8864762,0,t3_51no4a,Hmm this would probably be my worst nightmare. A great score with a not so great CARS. Before you decide to retake I think its really important that you set a concrete plan on how you plan to improve CARS and what the chances are that you will get a higher score in CARS while keeping relatively similar scores in the other sections. Im not sure if youre outside of Ontario but I think it would be a good idea to figure out how many schools are not available to you depending on your CARS score. If youre comfortable with your other options schools that dont weigh CARS as heavily then dont retake. However if you want to open yourself up to more schools AND you know you can do better in CARS I would say retake. But ultimately I guess its up to you.,Mcat,d7df4j4,1,t5_2saxp

9206043,0,t1_d8ivg99,I heard very bad things about prep courses  basically they never did anything you couldnt do yourself   and they were extremely expensive so I self studied and used the saved money to buy practice material. It may be overwhelming at first but its not if you use a reasonable schedule stick to it and reward yourself with time to unwind. Also while self studying I dont recommend you write notes unless its a subject that is really alien to you and youre have a lot of trouble with. Writing notes made my Kaplan studying a lot more stressful and I never ended up going back to review the notes so it was time wasted as well. Self studying was intimidating for orgo and biochem since I hadnt done them at all in college but with going over it multiple times and selftesting a lot I ended up fine. Bottom line if youre a confident self studier definitely skip the courses and go it yourself. I recommend EK books as I found them more to the point than kaplan and easier to get through in general. If you need to supplement biochem or orgo check out khan academy for those. But youll be fine if you make sure to do plenty of practice to identify weak spots. Best of luck!,Mcat,d8ixo0v,4,t5_2saxp

9337220,0,t3_58ctmz,If you have read all of the EK books your main issue isnt content. I would read the biochem chapters on Lehningers principles of biochemistry chapters  and also any other chapters that you feel weak on.Heres the thing you think you had gaps in knowledge but there were probably other cues to answering the question that you missed. I had some questions that seemed pretty insane at first glance but actually required knowledge of a simple concept to eliminate all of the wrong choices. The majority of my questions on both of my MCAT writes required superficial understanding of the content coupled with an excellent comprehension of the passage and the data presented. You might have had a different type of exam but what most likely happened is what I said above. You said you scored  on the EK exams and high s  low s is indeed an excellent score for those. The fact that you scored what you did on the AAMC scored is a surprise to me and is an indicator of a fundemental issue you have with comprehending AAMCstyle passages not content. The majority of AAMC scored questions rely more on an excellent understanding of the passage material as opposed to indepth knowledge of minutia and the same is true in the real MCAT. Make no mistake about it you still have to know the content but the material presented in the EK books should already be more than enough.In my opinion your score will not increase significantly if you spend your time watching the khan academy videos. Your score will increase if you improve your ability to comprehend difficult passages using simple concepts that were outlined in the EK books. Doing practice exams NS will help with this but I wouldnt write exams  because I think the NS exams go down in quality considerably after exam . My recommendation complete the  NS exams in ideal testing conditions. No pauses breaks or cheating. Really work on comprehending the passages. Work on the EK endof book passages those are imo invaluable practice for AAMCstyle questions. After that try completing as many of the old AAMC Fls as you can. I dont think you will benefit greatly from wasting your time on more content review.Good luck and keep up the grind,Mcat,d8zk7jo,3,t5_2saxp

They have an app that lets you download and watch videos on the go. If I could rewind time I would use this exclusively for content review and then do AAMC stuff leading up to the test. AAMC deserves more credit for this resource.

I think EK did quite a good job with everything else in terms of depth and material needed to know. Still read through all of EK even when supplementing.PS for TPR is honestly amazing.

Unless of course you feel that you already have a good grasp of the material in which case I would suggest a  split. At that point I would split up the months and set goals for yourself on a weekly basis. You want to set short term goals along with overarching long term goals. For example if my test was in April I would say that I want to finish content review by the end of January long term goal and plan to get  chapters of my Kaplan book done per day short term goalThe short term goals help because you feel like youve achieved something at the end of the day and that motivates you to keep going ,Mcat,dab7t9o,2,t5_2saxp

Off Again this shows that in this conformation a little over  of the gene signal is greater than uM from the PfSET complex.Overall this should mean that the gene is probably activated once PfSET comes close enough to it. Meaning PfSET is some kind of factor involved in the activation of this gene.Same for Var   Graph This is basically the same thing except that it is measuring distance between the gene signals and the nearest or next nearest telomere cluster signal.Basically the closer the gene is to telomeres means it is inactive which makes sense seeing as the gene should be closed up and coiled up to be compact.

9952087,0,t3_5i20m4,Goals know all the content you need to know well enough for the mcat have the testtaking skills needed to take the mcatContent can be done in a few ways. If you need to review everything then get a set of books or mix and match the content you need from different sources. TBR KA TPR EK whatever. Figure out how much time youll need to get through all the content and plan that out on a calendar. ex spend  hours x  days per week studying which equates to  chapters per week. Plan out what chapters you want to do until all chapters are done.Ive heard generally good things about EK for everything but biochem generally good things about TBR practice questions for everything but ochem and generally good things about KA for psych and socio. But take that how you will and read up on others reviews too!If you just need to review a few things then cut out the content from above you dont need to do and adjust your time calculations accordingly. You can determine how much you need content review by taking a diagnostic exam it really helps to get a feel for how indepth or not the mcat can test you or by reviewing the aamc topic list.Testtaking skills can really only be done by practice. Depending on how good your natural mental focus esp. extended mental focus is you might take anywhere from  fulllength exams. Dont burn yourself out!Testtaking also coincides with content review! Personally Id reserve  hours just to review the content you missed on the test. So this means youre taking at most  full length exams a week taking and reviewing on alternating days.As with content review testtaking should be scheduled out ahead of time so you wont get to the exam with only e.g.  practice tests under your belt.Personally I recommend at  weeks reserved just for full length exam practice and review.,Mcat,db4s6mm,5,t5_2saxp

With the exception of CARS which is virtually identical to the old stuff the material is just easier because its more content based. The new MCAT requires more critical thinking and analysis of passages while the QPack questions feel more like discretes. Its good to do at the start of your MCAT practice to help solidify key conceptswhich is what those questions usually test but worthless as a representation of the new MCAT.

Pyruvate Dehydrogenase is allosterically inhibited by AcetylCoA but that enzyme does not matter if AcetylCoA is being provided via Beta oxidation.

10429490,0,t3_5pd5oz,Ive taken the not reading in detail suggestion to the extreme and I usually dont even look at the passage and jump straight into the questions. Its probably a bad idea but a lot of the time theres still a lot of extraneous information even if you try to skim it if that makes sense. For CP theres a lot of calculations at least for my test this past week and most of these calculations just require a few numbers from a paragraphgraph which you can briefly find. For BB I do the same method but instead of jumping straight into the questions I try to figure out the dependentindependent variables from the graph and extrapolate from that information what the whole passage as a whole was trying to getting across. If the question doesnt refer to something about the graphs theres usually something in the question that is pretty specific like a protein name an amino acid random bone anatomy  on my test so stupid. When that happens refer to the specific portion of that passage that mentions that protein amino acid bone etc. and you can most often find the answer or information that will guide you to the answer.For PS I read everything in detail but thats only because I always have like an extra  minutes if I skim.,Mcat,dcq92kh,1,t5_2saxp

I have a question for you friend. In the case of EtOH and water since the azeotrope occurs at . EtOH would distillation still be useful if we start out with a liquid with only  EtOH?

10785544,0,t3_5u9f9b,To repost what I wrote on a similar thread a couple of days ago...gt Theres a saying that worrying once causes you to suffer twice. I personally have not been great at not worrying about my MCAT score however I do think that theres wisdom in those words  there is nothing you can do about your MCAT score now. That was taken out of your hands the minute you decided not to void your exam. Nothing you say do or think now can impact your score.gtWhile I see the value of mentally preparing yourself Im not sure if thats such a great idea. Ive daydreamed of scoring anywhere from   points of my AAMC average and its not very pleasant to imagine the lower end of things. Ive come to think that the best thing to do is try not to think about it accept that your score is what it is until you recieve it  then you can react accordingly.And no I think part of the trouble with the MCAT is that the vast majority of people Ive come across think that the real MCAT is more difficult than the official practice tests. However the real MCAT is most likely curved more in order to compensate for this disparity. Its hard to put trust in a curve I dont think anyone wants to do that or feels comfortable doing that but there is literally nothing else you can do. ,Mcat,ddsg89m,2,t5_2saxp

If you took a tertiary amide and placed it on the carbonyl derivative table you would see that it is at a much higher reactivity than other amides. Why? Well it has absolutely nothing to do with leaving group stability because they would be equivalent. It has to do with the availability of the lone pair to participate in resonance gt affecting electrophilicity. Im not too disappointed though.

11626128,0,t3_65vd5h,this saved my life. read the passage such that you DONT have to look back at it then answer questions. I went from averaging around  to around  just by just focusing on the passage and confidently answering the questions. I also started timing myself for  minutes per passage as Ive heard the passages on the test are much longer than any of the practice material. You might be able to improve a lot just by changing your mindset and having more confidence it really changed everything for me. Best of luck ,Mcat,dgdu0w1,1,t5_2saxp

11653608,0,t3_66apzi,Depends on how well you study coming up to it! If youve gotten enough done and feel prepared enough maybe prepare as if ur taking it the day before the wedding then yeah go head take a break for a day good burnout prevention. Id try not to get super drunk though that can mess with memory stuff ,Mcat,dggy8sx,3,t5_2saxp
11653936,0,t1_dggz6yq,Since i only really studied for  weeks i continued hard studying for the two weeks before. Not a normal route ik. I only took the day before the exam off.  Are you fatigued during the day when you sleep at  and wake up by ? Because if not then props to you your body probably doesnt need that much sleep and boom u have extra time in ur life and im insanely jealous! Haha. Everybodys body is different and if you feel perfectly fine with  hours of sleep then ignore the people who say you need . If you are fatigued and wish u could sleep longer id look into teas or techniques to help get you to bed faster potentially melatonin pills or whatnot seems more like an insomnia problem at that point look up other techniques. Also it takes about a week or two to adjust your sleeping point so if its been less than that time just keep at it. ,Mcat,dggzl0q,1,t5_2saxp

11660553,0,t3_66d0tr,But the author his opinion doesnt think the current system is practical. Read paragraph  more closely. The Author is upset and thinks the current education system is impractical. Generally accepted They are merely following the usual practice....Ineffective abstraction... little to do with the learner  how author brings in empirical evidence from Piaget Dewey.. And looking back at the introduction about many empirically sound proposals to increase the effectiveness.. have been dismissed.IDK. It is a hard question though.,Mcat,dghqlef,1,t5_2saxp

If you are more interested in going to medical school for the ranking of the school and not in becoming a doctor you are in the wrong field.

11751580,0,t1_dgrvtx3,Yes I feel like if I just absorb the facts and theories Ill be ok!Ill probably read through the page version then supplementreview with the pager. Think its worthwhile to take extensive notes while learning PS? Or just read through then use Anki or something?That sounds good. Im thinking of just covering the BB and CP content that I dont know comfortably using the Kaplan books then seeing where other holes in my knowledge are while doing practice questions.And ok! Ive heard the sbank questions are pretty tough but Ill get a jump on sections and subsequent review. Any other recommendations? Free resources? ,Mcat,dgs2kiu,2,t5_2saxp
11753974,0,t3_67q2yq,I missed this one as well but looking back on it I do see their logic. Basically the goal of the study is to assess the influence of peer evaluations on the state selfesteem of the participants. If the participants did not perform the first survey the researchers would have no idea how the experiment influenced the participants state selfesteem and would not be able to infer much of anything. The first questionnaire allowed the researchers a baseline to compare against which is essentially a negative control the expected result without any influence in this case.The longitudinal answer caught me but longitudinal studies tend to examine the same variable at different points. While this does examine the same variable at a different point in time the main reason that led me to believe it isnt longitudinal is that there is a manipulated variable that is predicted to influence the results that is introduced. This means even though we are resampling something at two points in time we are changing other variables in a way that is expected to change the result. This would indicate to me that it is more of an experimental approach and longitudinal doesnt really apply in this case. ,Mcat,dgscc6b,2,t5_2saxp
