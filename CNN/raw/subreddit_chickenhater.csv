We have to remove it.Click on the delete option above under the title to remove this before submitting again.The tags indie alternative mashup cover remix experimental or instrumental on their own are not good enough. If you only used one of these tags that is the reason for removal. Please add a more descriptive tag to your title that tells us something about the sound of the band.For example rock folk blues jazz electronic hiphop world punk metal soulTags like instrumental piano electro remix experimental jazz and indie rock work just fine. If you did include a valid tag beyond the generic indiealternative then you are using a tag we dont recognize yet. This is not a problem! Message the moderators.
