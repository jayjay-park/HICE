809718,0,t3_23evf3,It would help if you posted pictures.  Sometimes plants go into flower as a response to stress plants have been designed to try to reproduce if it seems death is immanent so soil container size light etc. could be a factor contributing to early flowering.In general I think you should leave the flowers alone.  If the plant sets too many fruit for its size you can always pinch after the flowers fall off.  At this stage the flowering hormone is active in the plant and youre not going to stop it from encouraging flowers by picking off the flowers you see.  You might be destroying vegetative nodes in the process.,HotPeppers,cgwbieq,2,t5_2tlk9

I have  bell pepper plants waiting to go in the garden. Because of crop rotation I may have to build another raised bed or plant them in  gallon pots for now. It seems the weevils are attacking only the cayenne and bullnose bells. The ghost peppers the Hawaiian chili peppers Thai chili pepper scorpion maruga and the habaneros all seem fine.

2265231,0,t1_clroysc,you really can get by with using regular bulbs. Dont waste your money on bulbs or tubes that say they are specifically for gardening or aquariumsthey just cost more.  I took a note from the poorer pot growers and use a handful of soft white CFLsto try and achieve a certain  of lumenssqft and light spectrum and supplement with  a ballast with x ft tubes in it.. I also have a wHPS but I only have that over my small hydro unit. also looking into using a huge strip of LEDs I have just to see what happens. Controlling the duration of the light cycle and tricking the plant is pretty helpful for producing fruit. first you can setup light schedules to do longer vegetative periods and then control when you switch into a fruiting state. ,HotPeppers,clrpaiv,1,t5_2tlk9

6723134,0,t1_d0eg7kb,I have already grown two plants of the same variety side by side with one topped and one untopped. The untopped plant was taller larger overall and yielded early and more overall but did require staking. It ended up being huge and bushy because peppers send up a ton of tips even without topping.  The topped one became bushy earlier on of course and appeared denser but it began setting fruit about two weeks later than the untopped one and definitely did not produce higher yields although yields werent really reduced either. The main benefit was it did not require staking.Im not saying topping has no effect Im saying its not at all required and doesnt necessarily increase yields. Selective pruning to increase light penetration is beneficial though but you dont have to cut the entire top off a plant.People get too many ideas from reading cannabis grow forums FIMing low stress training topping etc which have a way larger impact on a plant that tends to have one main stalk. Of course the techniques have an effect on peppers too its just mostly pointless given their natural growth habit. ,HotPeppers,d0eqaw4,2,t5_2tlk9

Since most of the soil will still be the  Gardeners Supply soil Im only using the miracle grow soil to fill out the rest of the transplant pot do you think that would be okay for until I move them to  gallon pots?Im only asking because Im trying to avoid buying and waiting for a different soil to arrive if Im only going to be using a little bit of it to support the plants through their adolescence. What do you think?,HotPeppers,d1h7bt8,2,t5_2tlk9
7095173,0,t3_4cpqq7,The plant looks fine.  The few leaves that look off could be affected by a lack of light overwatering or overfertilization.The first leaf is wet and appears to be touching the soil which is also wet in these pictures.  Water promotes the growth of the molds that cause rot.  Water droplets can also act as a lens amplifying sunlight like a magnifying glass.  Dont water the leaves  water the soil.It looks like the pot already has plenty of slowrelease fertilizer in it.  Dont add any more fertilizer.  In fact Id get a cheap soil testing kit from the big box store and do a quick soil test.  Specifically look for outofwhack pH or phosphorous levels.  If either are significantly outofwhack it will affect the ability for your roots to take up nutrients.  Nitrogen levels seem fine because your leaves are not abnormally light or dark.Remember that peppers love full sun.  Anything less than full sun will impact its ability to photosynthesize the carbohydrates needed for growth.Be wary of amending the soil at this point.  You could do more damage to the plant.  Do not add nutrients to the soil without first verifying that there is a deficiency by way of a soil test.  Again as is the plant looks fine.  Give it as much sunlight as you can and be careful not to overwater it.  The more sunlight the plant has the more the stomata will be open the more it will transpire lose water vapor which will cause more water to be taken up by the roots which will cause more nutrients to be transported to growth areas the more carbon dioxide it will take in a key reactant in photosynthesis etc etc.,HotPeppers,d1klvo0,3,t5_2tlk9

8056472,0,t3_4pjn9b,One of my favorite things to do with my peppers is to make a pickled hot mix. I used both jalapenos and habs last year. Its the same pickling process as with pickles but i use cauliflower carrots a little sliced white onion a few cloves of garlic and a few seasonings. You dont have to can it either. A quick hot bath to get them to seal and youre good to go. If youre not into that kind of stuff than you can always make poppers. Jalapenos are great whole but i always halve and core my habs for it. Just be careful how many of them you eat. They are still habs after all. If you dont have a tolerance than you will feel it.As far as grilling goes I usually dehydrate a good portion of my peppers to be ground into powder. This is great for adding to marinades and dry rubs to get that extra kick of heat. Adding a few pieces of poblano and jalapenos has turned out quite well in my kabobs. If you can handle it try using habs and pineapple with your chicken kabobs. I really enjoy the heatsweet combo and they complement each other very well. All in all its just about trying something and seeing if it works. Ive made a Dragon Cayenne citrus marmalade that sounds terrible but makes some very delicious pork ribs. Figure out what tones you sense in each type of pepper and try to compliment it. The choices are endless.,HotPeppers,d4lmgax,3,t5_2tlk9

9632915,0,t3_5cxztg,it looks like calcium  ph problem. from the st link on articles in the wikigt The very low mobility of calcium is a major factor determining the expression of calcium deficiency symptoms in plants. Classic symptoms of calcium deficiency include blossomend rot of tomato burning of the end part of tomato fruits tip burn of lettuce blackheart of celery and death of the growing regions in many plants. All these symptoms show soft dead necrotic tissue at rapidly growing areas which is generally related to poor translocation of calcium to the tissue rather than a low external supply of calcium. Very slow growing plants with a deficient supply of calcium may retranslocate sufficient calcium from older leaves to maintain growth with only a marginal chlorosis of the leaves. This ultimately results in the margins of the leaves growing more slowly than the rest of the leaf causing the leaf to cup downward. This symptom often progresses to the point where the petioles develop but the leaves do not leaving only a dark bit of necrotic tissue at the top of each petiole. Plants under chronic calcium deficiency have a much greater tendency to wilt than nonstressed plants.,HotPeppers,da0gdu1,1,t5_2tlk9

10575931,0,t3_5rceke,Why cheat? Are you worried about being embarrassed? I mean I dont know the type of recruiting youre doing but maybe having it effect you in a major way would actually be a BENEFIT to the recruiting in terms of making it a spectacle. Think of it as you taking one for the team. Get some good support and spin it in a positive way.    Alternate In the privacy of your own home find some habaneros or ghost peppers and start pounding them down one a night as long as you can do it SAFELY. By sheer comparison eating the habanero in public will be much easier.,HotPeppers,dd6toza,7,t5_2tlk9
10754472,0,t1_ddp61pv,Hah! Actually might be an idea to set up a ladybug house nearby so they set up shop there and you can just move it outside in spring with the plants to keep them around. From what Ive seen there isnt much to them but a source of fresh water and maybe some food or bedding they can use when not munching on aphids might keep them local to the plants?,HotPeppers,ddp8qhg,2,t5_2tlk9

11763571,0,t3_67sr4b,Sure.  Id cull pods and flowers earlylike now  do some selective pruning of growing tips early on to induce branching and maybe give one strong dose of nitrogen fertilizersomething around  or   to  encourage vegetative growth during early season.  Then in a  or  weeks go with low N and higher P and K something close to  once you have some growth put on to get ready for flowering and pods. Youll got more peppers later in the long run.,HotPeppers,dgtfhs6,1,t5_2tlk9
