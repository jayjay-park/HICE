7806057,0,t1_d3tgbjs,that link has nothing to do with fair use though. your point still falls very short. the main point is you do not understand copyright and what fair use is. transformative work is anything that changes the original content. it was a  minute video with  minutes of youmatt. thats transformative. if they simply just uploaded your video on their channel then yeah you would have a case. they reviewed your video and it overall wasnt the main part of the video. im sorry you dont want to see or believe it but you are wrong. ,MattHossZone,d3tgo68,2,t5_3erd7
