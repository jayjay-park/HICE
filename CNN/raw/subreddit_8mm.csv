4129763,0,t3_37ym3h,Wow. Ive never seen one of these. That big rubber wheel is completely foreign to me Im assuming its part of the Super cassette mechanism. Is there an opening where the arrow is pointing that you could simply feed the film into? It doesnt make sense that you would have to thread around that rubber wheel were talking about a consumer projector that should be relatively easy to load. Usually you have to press down on something to engage the autoload so Im guessing you should should still push down the lever though I have no explanation for the weird arm.,8mm,crr0mbu,2,t5_2wify

7032188,0,t1_d1dg942,Thanks! I wonder if it can be used in my camera even? Its a Canon Auto Zoom . From what Ive seen its not even the same cartridge. Id like to experiment even if the results are spotty like you say,8mm,d1dgbx2,2,t5_2wify

9816374,0,t3_5fr9e1,Im not exactly sure what you plan to do with a once per frame sync pulse but you might have a hard time actually using that to sync the sound up in post. The tape recordersplayers were made to control the motor speed of playback in order to keep the pilot signal in sync.  So it might be difficult unless youre actually using one of those tape decks to record your audio. Read up about  if youre interested. I would assume there could be a software solution for resolving the audio speed based on the sync tone but I dont know of one offhand.,8mm,dan3b5q,2,t5_2wify
