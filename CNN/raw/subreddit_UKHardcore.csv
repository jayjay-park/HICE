11514344,0,t3_646ayt,Yeah I aint into Srl thats just bad cheese lol. Im  amp Ive been into hardcore since I went to Slammin  Bagleys in  amp the tune that did it for me was Rushin on Pink Champagne. My fella does a lot of mixing amp hes far more into technical side of things. His taste changes from month to month its Karl Future amp Lost Soul atm which I dont mind but Im an old skool girl at heart love the build up amp the drop  the hands in the air moment! Love my trance amp hardhouse as well. Hes a few years younger than me amp I hadnt listened to hardcore for a while till I met him amp he used to say my music was outdated till I pointed out most hardcore tunes he liked were just remixes of stuff from when I was partying in early  Cry Till Tears Do Us Part Lizard Fiji. Anyway yes my collection is on discs hard drives memory sticks my mates hard drive lol. Right from St cd single I bought   Lock down  Gunman  up to Petruccio amp Modulate amp Kev Energy. I will go through what Ive got here amp get back to you with a list mate ,UKHardcore,dg15i17,1,t5_2ruv2
