7589868,0,t1_d34wqpp,To be honest Im glad they arent going to be not that theyre bad songs but like Im pretty sure the band isnt including them because they were sorta oneoffs for HITS just to hold us over til the new album was released. Plus its been a pretty long time since they released so they didnt really have a chance to be included. Had the album been released last year if they kept going with their  year tradition then Id say it may have been possible. ,BillyTalent,d34xim4,1,t5_2t36v
7834361,0,t3_4ml8s0,Im seeing these next week for the th time and I dont know if I should watch this video now or keep the set list a surprise as theyre most likely the same. Either way Im so exited for Download Fest.,BillyTalent,d3wneuy,1,t5_2t36v

8456591,0,t3_4v0tm0,I saw them just last night at a secret show in Vancouver. It was at a nightclubbar and the only way to get on was to win. You couldnt buy tickets. It was super intimate and I was at the front so I could have reached out and touched them multiple times. Didnt do that of course cause thats creepy. But just trying to show how close I was. My boyfriend scored a guitar pick from Ian and it was super hot in the venue so he passed me a water. Super nice dude. Ill never forget that show. Their energy was awesome! Since they just released the new album they only played a few new songs and the set list was mostly old songs. ,BillyTalent,d5ylx8x,2,t5_2t36v

11513801,0,t3_630hmr,I always thought I need to find a role model like I need a hole in my head was meant to mean I dont need a role model. Your I interpretation fits the rest of the song better though.This is yet another song mentioning rain as a metaphor for life throwing shit at you. They do that really often and I think its a nice way of saying things.,BillyTalent,dg13adz,2,t5_2t36v
