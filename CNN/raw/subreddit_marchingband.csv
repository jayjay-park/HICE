166875,0,t3_1v153u,People who arent into marching band only like shows that appeal to them. Like if the band plays a song they know or makes a cool shape in drill. They dont often appreciate bands that do something more original because it just isnt their thing.

202012,0,t1_cf1chy3,You cant compare a highschool to a college band when youre talking about whos better. Obviously the college band will probably sound better because they have more experience than the freshmen and sophomores in high school.Thats like saying The frog is better than the tadpole because the tadpole doesnt have legs yet.When you get into collegeprofessional bands you judge them differently than you would judge a highscool band. You judge college bands much more harsher than you would a highschool band. if a highschool drumline is a little dirty then you say It could be better but good job for a highschool drumline but when a college is dirty you say What are you? In higshcool? Fix this or get off the lineTherefore it is not fair to compare the two.  ,marchingband,cf1gacn,0,t5_2rmqc

1305050,0,t3_28x3sr,I wasnt really embarrassed but I think its pretty funny considering the circumstances Ill give some backstory to explain why I think its funny. So freshman year band camp went great was your average rookie school rehearsals start and I forget shorts for the first rehearsal so I have to practice in dark red skinny jeansI was in my scene phase freshman and sophomore year and wore some pretty skinny and colorful pants. Sophomore year. New band director we start doing spirit themed days at band camp. One day was called superhero dayalso whichever section won spirit day would get to be at the front of the dinner lineour show that year was called The Men Behind Masks and we had  movements Phantom of the Opera Kiss From A Rose from Batman Green Hornet theme song Zoro and William Tell Overture. My section had  members plus a tech so we all dressed up according to the movements. I was batman so I wore all black for the entire day. Didnt pass out or anything no problems. Junior year me and my section leader were in an indoor drumline the previous year so we decide to wear our uniforms all day. We were pretty much wearing extra hot pajamas. Nothing bad happens all day. Senior year I am now a section leader and most of the staff like to use me as examples for demonstrate marching technique etc. Well there I am. First day of band camprookie camp so just rookies and section leaders we were all standing in a basics block when I get a not so good feeling in my stomach. I remember I had eaten Taco Bell for dinner the night before. I stay there standing at attention when I burp softly and know that its going to happen. I whisper to one of the drum majors to come over to me and I tell him Im going to throw up in like  seconds he tells me to go to the bathroom so I walk to the school and before I can make it to the bathroom I puke into a hallway trashcan. Walk back outside see leadership is supposed to be teaching rookies how to march. Join back in like nothing happened and tell the entire low brass section I just threw up and then go back to teaching how to march. TLDR spent  years of high school marching band doing things that should cause me to pass out with no problem. Eat Taco Bell and throw up senior year. EDIT I also now march DCA and and WGI and expecting to march DCI next season. ,marchingband,cigfnud,1,t5_2rmqc

1465670,0,t3_2axjzq,Musically confidence is  as a drummer. Because quads are very visual instruments if you think you look and sound good you almost certainly will look and sound good.Marching in my experience is the least of the three issues for drummers. As long as you keep your feet in time and know which foot goes in front on the crab step you are good to go.For fitness just remember rule  cardio. Marching band is all about endurance so its important that you can finish just as strong as you started. This isnt drum corps so you dont need to kill yourself with a k every day even going for a walk will help you out.To improve your ability to carry the quads take them home with you turn on the TV and stand there in attention position for as long as you can. Its important to maintain good posture not only to create good habits but also because standing with your back arched is very bad for you.With that all being said marching band is  a mental game so if you can keep your focus you will succeed.

1822097,0,t3_2fdfza,At this point its on the band director to have a backbone and talk with the student away from all other students probably with at least one other staff member in there but not so many that itll become intimidating.  The attitude you describe almost makes it seem like she doesnt want to be there and since its an elective she doesnt have to be there.  Dont bring the whole group down because of your poor attitude type of thing.  It also sounds like she doesnt respond to negative reinforcement.  Instead if theres a privilege that can be taken away from her without affecting the rest of the band maybe thats something the band director can dangle in front of her saying you dont get this unless theres a noticeable improvement in your attitude towards both staff and the rest of the band.  And the longer this goes on without the band director doing something about it the worse its gonna get.  Hell at this point it sounds like the director may be close to having an excuse to get an administrator involved if shes showing a bunch of disrespect towards a school faculty member.

Also were not allowed to go out to the bars parties etc. in anything that could identify us as a band member. When not wearing our full uniforms on game day were supposed to fold them neatly not hang them over things or just leave them lying around. Were also supposed to keep our instruments organized looking in neat rows and stuff. So word to the wise uniform rules dont slacken as you get older.

Our show this year had some really cool woodwind licks but they were often naturally overpowered by brass countermelodies or just the brass players sitting on whole notes. At one point in our show this year we had to make our alto sax melody become the entire woodwind sections melody minus flutes. The tenor saxes and clarinets were playing a counter melody along with low brass and it sounded as if that was the melody. The alto sax sound was so swallowed that our BD just threw in the clarinets and tenors.  ,marchingband,cnazrl2,3,t5_2rmqc

4779039,0,t1_ctwtbdw,well on the day you arrive in Chicago you can go north about  miles or so and Lake Zurich Stevenson and Cary grove high schools should all be practicing from about . Lake Zurich is closest to the city and is close to one of the highways used to get to the other schools. They dont learn drill during band camp so they are about a step behind in quality.Cary grove is a much smaller band that is about  miles west of lake Zurich but they are the only competition band of the bunch and have a much higher amount of technical skill. Stevenson is furthest away from the city and is very similar to lake Zurich.  They have a bit lower quality compared to LZHS as they dont have a class period during the day to practice wheres the other two schools have time during the school day to learn.To answer your question as a whole though Fridays and Saturdays are your best bet. The only other time bands would be out doing something is during practice. Which of course means a lot more time will be spent learning the drill instead preforming it. But those schools north of the city will have some of the larger bands along Route  wherever there is a city one or many of its suburbs will have at least  members.,marchingband,ctwxtb8,1,t5_2rmqc

The shank length is tuned for a trumpet not a mellophone so there will be harmonic resistance happening it wont resonate as well. Similar reasoning applies to why I would recommend just as hard against using a horn mouthpieceadapter though it tends to only be native horn players who are tempted to do that. The mellophone is neither a trumpet nor a horn and should not use their mouthpieces.,marchingband,cz3qt15,2,t5_2rmqc

6420809,0,t3_42osy6,The idea is that you want to play on the hardest reed that you can comfortably get a good sound from on your mouthpiece.  For most people and most mouthpieces that tends to be a  or . once you get past the beginner stage.  Something to keep in mind though is that the opening in the mouthpiece plays a part in what strength reed works best.  In addition to that softer reeds tend to make it easier to play in the lower registers while harder reeds help you in the higher registers and are more difficult to use in lower registers.  Nothing too extreme.  But with that in mind the bari sax player for Tower of Power who sort of makes a living playing low notes uses a . strength reed on a mouthpiece with a giant opening to help make those low notes pop out.,marchingband,czjg5ap,1,t5_2rmqc
