3459500,0,t3_2zrl5j,TLDR Some GamerGate activists uncovered evidence of a male SJW tumor harassing a female SJW tumor over a period of three years or so. Realizing that this will break the narrative SJW tumors have metastasized into one huge megatumor in denial of what happened and what it means.Thats what I get from it anyway.,WerthamInAction,cpmlx5b,3,t5_37fmo

5112124,0,t3_3kzl6r,Its no mystery these things just dont sell.Id be the first one to market with a comic catering to thirdwave feminist insanity if there were a market for it but These people dont buy comics. Or science fiction and fantasy books. Or games. Or any of the other markets theyre trying to corrupt. Their MO is to inject their ideology into media that other people buy so as to brainwash them. Nerd subculture members arent stupid. Theyre not going to take this shit lying down. You cant sell to them with this MO. Even if there were a market for such content corrupting existing characters with an established legacy is not how you do it. Thats cultural appropriation which is against these peoples supposed ideology in the first place. Its also disrespectful to longtime fans and alienates them.,WerthamInAction,cv27aga,8,t5_37fmo
5755904,0,t1_cxakklk,gt So any time the lead character changes you are implying that namecostumeetc. should change? No new characters should be created that cater directly to SJW fetishes rather than vandalizing preexisting characters to serve this need. This is mainly for two reasons These people are never going to be happy with a oneissue What IfElseworlds experiment or a miniseries. They want to make their mark. They want significant changes not just a new job or a new relationship or a new power for the character but a new race or a new sex or a new orientation or hell all three at once.Its impossible to do the above without either erasure i.e. iconoclasm or a new character.,WerthamInAction,cxakp37,-1,t5_37fmo

7675088,0,t3_4kf4hc,Wait....We can say things likegt  a womans take on a superhero film gives a more nuanced insight than the maledriven counterpart and  women are typically better at details and extracting emotions than men so imagine what they could do with the MCU and DC universes.????  Isnt that generalising and attributing superiour qualities to a specific sex as opposed to gender?  Like isnt this chauvinism?We can say things likegt Men are frightened of a complicated female perhaps because men know deep down they are the weaker species?.?????  Isnt that generalising and being sexist about men as a whole?  Am I just not understanding this whole thing?EagleProbably not,WerthamInAction,d3em1ni,18,t5_37fmo

8292886,0,t3_4t2edl,Didnt bother watching the video Cracked videos always seem way longer than the joke can handle but in regards to the video description poking fun at Squirrel Girls nameDUH. One of the whole points of Squirrel Girl is that she takes something that ought to be incredibly lame and runs with it with the same exuberant passion she has for everything else. Her squirrel friend wears a pink bow and is named Tippy Toes. Embrace the absurd! Her partners are Chipmunk Hunk and Koi Boy.
