5185991,0,t1_cvb03qo,Focusing on audio might be what really helps you right now.  I record audio through Audacity so I can clean it after.  I put it through a noise cleaning plugin to eliminate staticbackground noise a noise gate and then listen to it in Audacity to cut out any breathing coughs bad speech and sometimes record over some portions.Next time you shoot I would try   More energy! Talk like you are giving a speech and project your voice.  It will give your audio some better quality and be more entertaining to listen to  Work on your mic placement maybe move it back? It sounds like you are up close and the mic is picking up lots of air like that puff of air when pronouncing p which is loud to a mic  Move the action along faster this is mainly the dialogue if you are going to voice readings of it  try to make it flow like an actual conversation.  Dead time with no gameplay and no talking isnt the best to watchOn a lighter note your channel art is amazing! It gives the channel a great look and isnt overbearing.  Do you have a schedule you release things on? When is your next new batch of new recordings?,Noobtube,cvb3p63,1,t5_2umq4

10450673,0,t3_5h3mmw,Hey just checked out your Momodora video guys seem to bounce off each other well good flow of conversation. One thing i did notice was the face cam sections are quite low on light so its hard to see you guys. Id get a little lighting and play around with some test shooting to get a brighter picture for those sections. Hope this helps!,Noobtube,dcsokej,1,t5_2umq4
