3471900,0,t3_300aul,I love the song! It definitely gives me a Dear Agony vibe. One of my favorite things about BB is Bens ability to just bring so much emotion to his vocals and I was really excited to see that in Failure. The new members also seem to be doing well especially considering the fact that BB had a very unique sound especially in the drumguitar area. Overall Im really optimistic about this album. ,BreakingBenjamin,cpo0sma,2,t5_2udwf
