890109,0,t1_ch5ggzb,gtPeople are waiting for a miracle to happen instead of working towards it.What miracle is going to convince an apathetic CEO that simply doesnt care?

3111243,0,t1_cokgytv,Thank you for that answer. I was curious as the website didnt specify. At least I didnt read that where I was looking. So is the organization not running any longer? I noticed a lot of the forums where from a few years ago. ,UnitedWeStand,cokh9ik,2,t5_312q5
