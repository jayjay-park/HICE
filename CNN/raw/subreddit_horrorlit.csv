342097,0,t3_1xzzye,There is a lot to choose from here. Id really suggest picking up the yearly Years Best anthologies edited by Ellen Datlow Stephen Jones and Paula Guran. These are a great way to sample some of the latest and greatest in genre writing. Aside from those there are still many many excellent anthologies. Heres a few to startJoseph Pulvers A Season in Carcosa and The Grimscribes Puppets being tributes to the works of Robert W. Chambers and Thomas Ligotti respectively. Ellen Datlows Inferno and Darkness are excellent nonthemed anthologies. Dennis Etchisons Metahorror is a classic and deservedly so. S.T. Joshis Black Wings and Black Wings  are good for your Lovecraftian fix. Now as for single author collections that may be an even bigger nut to crack. Unfortunately many collections in the past were published only in limited editions by small presses and may be very very difficult to find now. This is a lamentable trend and sadly enough some publishers keep it alive now a pet peeve of mind but I digress. Anyway here we go!If theres one author that Id say deserves more attention it would be Caitlin R. Kiernan. Two Worlds and In Between is the big one but as mentioned above its not so easy to get your hands on. The Apes Wife and Other Stories was just released and is widely available.Ramsey Campbell is a living legend. Get Alone With the Horrors for a great overview of his earlier work  and Holes For Faces for a sample of his newer material. John Langan and Nathan Ballingrud are newish authors making names for themselves. Check out The Wide Carnivorous Sky and North American Lake Monsters.Joel Lane was a truly unique talent now sadly departed from us. Where Furnaces Burn is a fabulous collection if you can find it. The Earth Wire is much easier to come by. Simon Strantzas is another newer author with a style similar to that of Thomas Ligotti or Mark Samuels. Beneath the Surface and Nightingale Songs are two of his collections. Gemma Files writes consistently excellent and very unique work. You can find her stories collected in Kissing Carrion and The Worm in Every Heart.Laird Barron rightly gets a lot of praise. All of his collections are well worth your time. Thomas Ligotti is a singular genius. Pick up The Nightmare Factory if you can find it or Teatro Grottesco if not. This post turned out to be very long. I cant help it I love talking about this stuff! I decided to cut it off here but I really could go further if anyones interested.  ,horrorlit,cfg87tm,8,t5_2uvwj

2229451,0,t1_clmnia1,working in what people want to call literary John Barth was and is a huge influence for and on me. Im convinced hes one of the most capable writers to ever put pen to paper. I would say Pynchon too but hes drawing on all the conventions of what people call genre stuff and just because hes not necessarily building genre I dont think that necessarily makes him literary either. and I cant say Marquez either though I do dig his stuff. but magical realism is definitely a genre. oh oh John Fowles. hes so so good on the page. and Louise Erdrich. shes been very much a prime influence for and on me. Vizenor too but I wouldnt necessarily call him nongenre. and Vonneguts as genre as genre gets and McMurtry is too. man. not a lot left. but too I should say that I verymuch resist there even being a socalled genre of literary. at the box office we call that drama dont we? much cleaner a term I think. on the book shelf though if theres no werewolves no spaceships no elves then the book falls through to the nothing category which then gets labeled literary. but literary for me is just an adjective that suggests this work isnt meant to be disposable that theres layers that you can get more from it from a second read and a third. so there can be literary horror literary science fiction and on and on. however what to watch out for there is people THEN using that literary adjective as an insulator. like if a book gets called literary horror does that mean its deep enough to not be disposable or does that mean someones trying to position it such that its outside the market like. that its concerned solely with art wont sully its hands with commerce. and thats just superdangerous. I hope to never be that kind of literary.I also hope to never again use airquotes as much as I just did.,horrorlit,cln7so3,3,t5_2uvwj

Adam keeps readers within claustrophobic proximity of the tormented Stephanie and its the last place anyone would really want to be.
