1799362,0,t3_2f0x8q, I really liked goldenglue Ive always followed coast but this is hard. Saddest part is these koreans might not even be that good. They havent even been announced. ,coastlife,ck5yp50,2,t5_2xk35
2199053,0,t1_clj6ka7,No doubt its best for Santorin but it surprises me that the Coast organization is willing to transfer him. TSM must have made a big offer. I have no clue who Coast could pick up now that is even close to Santorins level although they can get a foreign player which helps.,coastlife,cljcqzs,3,t5_2xk35
