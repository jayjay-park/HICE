To answer your question I would much rather Patrick Martin walk the Streets than Neer. Why do I feel this way? Because talking shit is a far less serious offense than what Neer committed.He was unconscious. That would be called a KO if it happened in the octagon.

4063046,0,t1_crjelon,I cant remember the trainer but he said just about everyone he knows on the East Coast is on some sort of illegal substance or anotherwith two notable exceptions Chris Weidman and Frankie Edgar.That made me respect those guys even more than I initially did. Its why you saw Weidman wig out on Belfort at the weighin. The dude kills himself in the gym so he has no respect for people to take chemical shortcuts.The Brazilians are allegedly the worst because in Brazil most of this crap is available overthecounter. But it doesnt just end with them. A buttload of the people who fight professionally are enhancing their game with roids coke or other chemicals.Its good to know thaton the East Coast at leastthere are a few clean elite fighters.Cain Velasquez out west is allegedly clean too. So his cardio is  real. The guys workethic is phenomenal.But its got to be tempting for all the other fighters Cain cardio from out of a bottle. Its just depressing when they get popped for these substances in screenings like Jones with the coke and masking agents for roids.Thats why I always thought a JonesVelasquez superfight would have been funny The two arent even remotely in the same league. Cains the real deal. Jones while originally a skilled combatant made that deal with the devil and took that long slide into becoming a chemical hero. He took shortterm gains over longterm health. So his body on the inside has to be ravaged to all hell in a way Cains isnt. Hell Cain can still produce testosterone. That tells you all you need to know on who The Man would be in a superfight. Ones the real deal. The other forfeited that when he flunked his screenings.,ufc,crjezyy,0,t5_2qsev

Ive watched Hollys fights for a long time and Im telling you Rohnda has never been punched by a professional boxer. All Holly did for years and years is work on her punching power. She didnt have to worry about the ground game or submission defense all she did was box. Sure Rohnda is amazing there is no denying that but Im going to say that Holly will do to Rohnda what GSP did to Koschek. Holly will keep her distance with the jab and then jump into Rohndas space with lethal combinations then jump back out. that will eventually wear Rohnda down until she is knocked out. The same thing would happen if Rohnda fought Mayweather like she says she wants to. He would cave her face in during a boxing match just like Holly is going to do when they eventually meet.

5607984,0,t1_cws68t4,Last I checked being popular isnt how this works. Winning fights is what should get good fights. Tate has worked hard to be the no contender she deserves another shot. Talk all the trash you want about Tate she is still the only one to go past the first round with Rousey. She is Rouseys biggest competition because she is the no contender which is earned by fights not popularity. Dana is worried his cash cow might lose the title so he avoids the fights that fans want to see Tate vs Rousey Cyborg vs Rousey. Dana wants Rousey to hold that title as long as possible so he can milk that cow dry. That much is obvious if you follow UFC on Facebook. Every post is about Rousey. All these Rousey fans dont care about how the rank structure is supposed to work they are band wagoners. Fuck Rousey and Fuck Dana White. They are turning a sport I love into a laughing stock of Rousey dick suckers. ,ufc,cws83p7,1,t5_2qsev

5697688,0,t3_3t3i7t,Have you ever either been knocked out or choked out?  Its a weird experience and her reaction there has nothing to do with being shaken it has to do with the normal experience of being knocked out.  Its hard to explain if youve never experienced it but what laymen dont realize is that you have no clue what happened.  When you first wake up you have no idea what happened.  The few seconds you were out you generally experience what seems like reality but is really a short dream that feels like it went on forever then you wake up and feel like the real world is a dream.  Then what happened vaguely sets in and you have all sorts of denial which is why they hold people down because they might try to pop up and hurt themselves worse.  At this point they may also have involuntary reactions like clenching their jaw or extending limbs.  It takes a good  minutes to even remotely have the reality sink in even longer to feel like yourself again.  ,ufc,cx3cq00,11,t5_2qsev

Not a deciding factor but it sure as fuck should count for something.Like I said if you show a million people who didnt watch the fight a pic of the count and a pick of the spider post fight  would say its pretty obvious who wonAnother problem with the scoring system  is these fights are judged round by round. Thats fucking stupid and its archaic.If fighter  lands  significant strikes in round  and fighter  lands  fighter  wins the round. Next round fighter one lands  and fighter  lands . Same for round .Fighter  lands  significant strikes and fighter  lands .Fighter  wins by decision  rounds to . But fighter  got his shit pushed in. Why should he win.

7545361,0,t1_d2zk82f,Well the real answer is we dont know since they get penalized for revealing how much they make haha. But with Alvarez it was the same issue. He got into a contract dispute with the former CEO of Bellator. Lawsuits ensued. It was because the UFC offered him a fight and then Bellator claimed matching ownership or something like that. Its a real mess really. Lets you know how far the UFC and MMA in general needs to grow before they will be taken seriously. You cant fuck over your fighters especially financially and expect everything to be kosher.,ufc,d2zvcvs,1,t5_2qsev

Silva made a good go of it and I cant not respect the man for stepping up with  days notice and little to no training after an operation and even then he could have knocked Cormier out if the fight went on longer. That knee really wobbled DC and would have been interesting to see what would have happened after that.Overall it was a shame really.

Punk cant walk into the UFC guaranteeing hes going to win and showing no respect to his opponent. Im not saying he wasnt a humble guy in training with his team or there has never been drama in the UFC or wrestling is fake and therefore redundant. What I am saying is that Punk had this attitude about him towards Gall that was unfounded and it feel like it was developed from his name and previous accolades. I admittedly havent kept up with the vlogs so my opinions are based on the clips that Ive seen in press conferences and the staredown as well as news stories etc. Im not claiming to be an expert. I dont blame him for taking his chance. If someone saw me playing football on a Tuesday night and offered me the chance to play for Newcastle Id snap it up in an instance. ,ufc,d7jb8yz,1,t5_2qsev

That being said I fancy Dillashaw for this fight. Hes a more worthy champion. I know Im in the minority when I say this but the Garbrandt antics in the Cruz fight were laughable. I would hate to see the sport turn into a contest of douchebaggery but Codys dancing and general behaviour in the octagon against Cruz stank. Trash talk is one thing but the lack of respect in the ring was just plain ugly. I would like to see TJ find success with his off beat striking and hope his wrestling pedigree can keep Garbrandt honest. With the threat of take downs it might reduce the ability for Cody to stand and bang constantly which is where I felt Cruz made a mistake. Further I like Bang Ludwig a lot. I think hes an intelligent coach and as a Muay Thai fan I like what he has done with his unique fighting style. I hope to see TJ display this in the ring with Garbrandt. All of the above is just opinion what I really want and I presume most fight fans would say the same is a great fight. I dont want dancing or celebrating like someone just pushed the dpad on their Playstation. I want to see great technique great fight intelligence and great talent in the ring.
