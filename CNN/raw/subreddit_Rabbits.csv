22846,0,t1_ceh0m74,Does he have toys and other distractions to entertain himself with while you are asleep? Maybe something like a pellet ball or veggies could entertain him while you both sleep. Im afraid that you may have exacerbated your problem unintentionally by rewarding him with attention and pets whenever he jumped on your bed.As for how to fix the problem youll need to train him that its not appropriate. I think you should just do some mock naps with the lights off and if he decides to jump on you say NO! shoo him off the bed and ignore him again.,Rabbits,ceh18vg,3,t5_2riv8

Beyond that I suggest taking them for car rides in the same carrier or doing a dryer session to push them closer. You can also let them hang out together in neutral territory but make sure they dont fight. Take them to a bathroom or the kitchen  somewhere they arent usually allowed to go.

233712,0,t3_1wrb09,I am not an expert at all so this post could be completely worthless. I also cant predict what is causing your bunnys head tilt. I dont want to be responsible for giving advice so this is just my personal story.My bunny survived a bout of head tiltrolling after I noticed his eyes darting and took him to the vet. I think the vet perscribed baytril orally for the suspected infection. I believe we went through several courses of this before the bunny got better. During this period the bunny was rolling A LOT and was very distressed not eating or drinking. So we hand fed him critical care and water and also gave him doses of infacol simethicone? the baby gas stuff you can use with rabbits cant remember what its called to help with gas and digestion.We also went to an ER vet who gave us something to help with any nausea he might be having I think she also injected him with anti nausea I could be wrong though. I cant remember what the stuff was called.We would often wake up to a living room covered in pee poop and hay because the poor bunny had been rolling all night. Luckily our rabbit vet allowed us to renew prescriptions for the baytril without having to pay for more visits again I think it was called this and we administered the perscribed dose religiously until the bunny eventually got better. Our rabbit was so bad that we had to physically reset his sitting position because he would roll almost nonstop without intervention.The vet since said that he thougt the bunny was a lost cause and was impressed by the perseverance. Keep in mind these things are very casebycase if my bunny had had a tumor or something it would have been different. Luckily it was the baytril ? that seemed to work for him.,Rabbits,cf4z2cb,1,t5_2riv8

305553,0,t3_1xkl3c,Unfortunately bonding two female bunnies is the worst case scenario best being a male and a female and having two males might work too.In any case make sure that theres enough food in the area where youre doing the bonding process since food distracts.And instead of immediately separating them Id try to wait it out. I know its hard to just watch them fight but if youre immediately separating them you might actually prevent the bonding process.I also dont think its a good idea to bond them in the shower. Get them into a large enough area where they can chase and run instead.,Rabbits,cfcfrrm,1,t5_2riv8

My bun isnt a biter or a nipper but he does pout for a few days once he wriggles free.   EDIT advice  Try to groom and get someone else to hold her down.  Save the treats for reestablishing trust and bun happiness post grooming.  Remember that rabbits can get bowl obstructions from their hairballs if you dont groom them often.

My local store gets their rabbits from a local breeder who does so on demand. Rabbits are only bred when supply is low. Its generally only big stores that ever have rabbits come back and theyre not there long before someone else has them.

The door was always open with a little baby blanket . at CVS lining the door so he wouldnt get stuck if he hopped too low or something. The cage was against a wall and I had the biggest playpen I could find at PetSmart touching the wall with both ends so it made a C shape to maximize play space.

Any other kits from the same litter or even one of the same parents has a chance of having the same problem Im afraid. Youre completely right in that most breeders dont gene check their buns. I would suggest contacting the breeder so she can inform whoever owns Lightnings littermates and watch out for their own buns but that is obviously completely up to you if you feel able to contact them. I was going to suggest a baby from a shelter but I see uNotTheDroidUrLookin has mentioned that and its not suitable for you. Could you get your sister on the adult rabbit bandwagon first tell her about their personalities how you can train some to do tricks show photos generally say what you like better about them? It would probably help to get her on your side.Depending on your relationship with your parents could you try explaining to them that actually a shelter rabbit is better as it means you already know their personality if theyre good at using a litter box things like that. At this time of year there will be lots of buns there just because people are bored of them after Easter not because theres anything wrong with them. If the shelter nearest you spays and neuters their rabbits you could also point out that theyd be saving the money they would spend on a neuter or spay which can be very expensive. ,Rabbits,ci2ge8m,1,t5_2riv8

1596056,0,t3_2ckcnc,Rabbits always eat their own poop! They eatgt poo gt eat the poop gt poo. This is because there is something that their bellies dont digest completelysome nutrients they cant take care of the first time around so they eat their poop the first time that round of poops come out so that their body can take care of everything they need. They dont eat the same poo several times though just fresh poo since it still has some nutrients or something in it.So dont worry bunnies are supposed to eat their poop!

1619816,0,t3_2cuvr7,What itll most likely be is that one of the bunnies will want to be the dominant bunny of that particular space. They may seem comfortable but one will have over all control over their new home and will be keeping the other in check letting them know its their space and the other is allowed their because they say so. My girlfriend has  girl bunnies who share a space but for a good few weeks before the older and dominant one would chase around the little one hump and bite her as they were being bonded and even still a little bit now theve been paired. Its just a way of showing dominance. Every paired bunny couple whether theyre both boysgirls or a mix will have a dominant and a submissive one its just the way bunnies work and with them being in a new space now with you itll be showing through again due to them refinding their positions. I wouldnt say its anything to worry about but if they start fightingdrawing blood or anything like that separate them! Hope this helps ,Rabbits,cjjcdrn,2,t5_2riv8

1755031,0,t3_2ejotu,So I know the wiki link is above but thought Id provide an abridged version for those in hurry as there are a lot of links there. How is it transmitted?Transmission is by biting insects other rabbits and you! Swat any and every fly in your home. Leave spiders to do their job if you have them. Keep windows and doors closed or put sheer netting over them if you need the airflow. I like to burn citronella candles or dabspray citronella oil around the home to deter bugs. Change litter trays often. Check any other pets for ticks and fleas.Stay away from any rabbit with symptoms if you have rabbits at home. If you are a showerbreeder stay away from shows until the worst of the outbreak is over. If you are in an area with an outbreak stop outside time for the time being. If you notice a wildie with the disease notify the local vet and rescues if you know them. You may wish to have someone else take an infected wild rabbit to the vet to be PTS or dispose of it by hand if they know what they are doing. I have disposed of wildies with myxi before is is very upsetting but if you can get close enough to catch a wildie with myxi it is going to die and I prefer to free them from their suffering. It is a very personal choice and everyone has their own opinions on this one. Some vets will PTS a wild animal for free or for a reduced fee it very much depends on the vet. What are the symptoms?Lethargy lack of interest in food and a high temperature. Swelling around the eyes lips and genitals. Seizures and haemorrhaging in the later stages. Rabbits with a chronic form develop tumours called myxomas or sometimes nodules on various areas of the body. Chronic myxi can also cause pneumonia so watch out for respiratory problems raspysnuffly breathing raising the head to breathe sitting in different positions than normal.My rabbit has symptoms now what?Phone your vet ASAP and explain that you have a rabbit with suspected myxi. Please do not turn up unannounced as you will be risking other rabbits. As always keep an eye on your rabbits eating drinking and pooping and let your vet know of any other symptoms. Myxomatosis is extremely contagious so please take every precaution if you have other rabbits. Move housing change clothes the whole shebang. What is the outlook?Outlook depends on the form of the disease and their vaccination status. Outlook for unvaccinated rabbits is very poor and your vet will advise PTS. Vaccinated buns fare better and there are several cases who have recovered even older buns. There is no cure for myxi and treatment is supportive only so it is a case of wait and see. ,Rabbits,ck0do4l,9,t5_2riv8
1766976,0,t3_2eq4xz,Looks good to me! Only a couple of things Id recommend based on your pic amp description.... Hes probably ok with jumping in and out of the cage now but at some point it might be good to have a ramp or cut out a door type thing from the cage to make going in amp out easier.. You probably dont need the straw especially if he ends up eating it. If youre already doing timothy I would just stick with that.. I dont know anyone whos used a paper lining for their litter box. Thats not to say its bad but a recycled paper litter like CareFresh works great at absorbing lots of liquid and odors as well. Also its comfier than a paper lining.Just my two cents.

Also if you take some of his pellets and put them in some water in a bowl and microwave them you can also feed those to him make sure they are luke warm not hot by syringe so he gets some nutrients in him.

If anything hay is the best thing for her to eat because it is the most fibrous and is less likely to upset her stomach since it is low energy roughage  hay is often the best medicine for tummy problems!I would also urge you to contact the pet shop and tell them what happened.

2462284,0,t1_cmfzobb,Shes doing really well. Ive mostly ignored her the last few days. I go in once maybe twice a day check out her food water and bathroom situation and hang out just sitting on the floor on my phone with the cage door open. At first she would hop around a bit but any movement or noise she would freak out. Now she will go around the room chin ALL THE THINGS and generally explore. Shes a licker. Ive held her a bunch of times to just kind of get her used to it and I get a bunch of kisses and grooming licksgentle nibbles when I hold her. This weekend we are going to try to introduce her to the cats if she stays calm enough. Our cats are dying to get into that room.Shes got a feisty personality though. She literally throws stuff around in the cage after I lock her in for the day. Smashes what she can against the cage doors. Its kind of hilarious.

2665960,0,t3_2qi2zb,Females usually fight over territory. Usually. They might need separate cages so each of them knows they have their own inviolable space  you know for the kits. They might need to have separate playtimes too for a while. But rabbits need other rabbits so be patient. After the holiday ruckus is over there may be less stressing the girls and they might settle down again. Also the fact that when each of you holds them they are fine may be a significant clue indicating jealousy or something along those lines. Maybe they need lots more cuddles and treats since it is their first Christmas.You can always get the surgery done later if nothing else works but radical hysterectomy is major surgery and you risk losing a bunny or two through anesthesia infection surgical trauma etc.. And no the uterine cancer scare is an overly broad and basically untrue assertion. Its based on the Green study done by one man on one warren of rabbits back in the s and it applies to one age range of female rabbits. Furthermore Europeans also love their bunnies but they spay at a fraction of the rate of Americans basically due to a different cultural views. Dont feel that you must surgically alter your rabbits bodies to achieve a behavioral change. Even if the surgery is successful you might not get the behavioral changes you wanted. And then what?Rabbits are not stupid meat robots. They have feelings and they are aware that you have feeling so compromise is always possible among sensitive intelligent creatures. Use the compassion patience and wisdom that your relationship with your furry friends has given you to explore all of your options and make the best decision for all parties concerned. Dont make a decision based on what some redditor said who doesnt know and love your bunnies as much as you do. You love them. Your heart is going to be ripped out of your chest if anything bad happens. Of course the final decision is and should always be yours and your wifes. GLHTH.,Rabbits,cn6kebe,0,t5_2riv8

Since you mentioned that Lilah wont even take treats its important that you do this as soon as possible to prevent her from going into GI stasis.  Youll want to get some critical care and a feeding syringe wrap her in a towel and try to get a bit of the food into her itll be a messy process and she isnt going to like it but its necessary if she isnt eating.Heres a link about how to syringe feed youll need to scroll down to that section  Good luck and let us know how Lilahs doing!,Rabbits,cp88myy,1,t5_2riv8

3646079,0,t1_cq7t6wx,I would measure his pellets. Its easy to overfeed if youre not. Being overweight and arthritic can make it much harder for a bunny to clean.  Arthritis doesnt always cause obvious pain but it can affect flexibility and bunnies need to be flexible to reach back there especially of theyve got a big gut. Arthritic backs are especially common in bunnies. Id also skip the brown bread and carrots and see if it helps. Thats a lot of sugar and carbohydrate and can cause cecal overgrowth.,Rabbits,cq7vp8z,1,t5_2riv8

I definitely think that having them side by side for the last couple weeks has helped we would have started bonding dates sooner except Remy was only neutered about a month ago and we were waiting for his hormones to calm down. Definitely I noticed less territoriality and aggressioncharging from Ginger once we started swapping their pens regularly. Im still convinced that the bond is going badly and its going to take forever even though everything Ive read indicates that theyre doing really well even though theyre nipping and occasionally scuffling.Best of luck with your bonding.  theres a lot of really helpful people here so be sure to check in and ask questions and let us all know how its going.,Rabbits,cqjdlae,2,t5_2riv8

3856009,0,t3_34hhny,I do hopping competitions with my rabbit  lb mini lop so Im pretty familiar with rabbit harnesses as a whole. The jackettype harnesses tend to be either too small or too large and greatly hinder a rabbits ability to move. There are very few rabbits that are perfectly comfortable wearing these because of this and on top of that they arent very adjustable and cant fit a wide variety of rabbits. Figure eight and rope harnesses should never be used on a rabbit Ive seen a rabbit get caught up in in a figure eight harness and almost strangle itself. The reason you shouldnt use rope harnesses is that they are generally too easy to chew through and have a similar design to the figure eight harness. I generally prefer things that are minimally restrictive and allow the rabbit to movejumprun freely. The harness that best suits this idea is called an Hharness They are the easiest to put ontake off are adjustable allow for ease of movement pretty cheap compared to some other styles and are light weight and comfortable. I personally use a Ferret harness that I bought at petco for my rabbit Here are some pictures tag was a large dog tag designedpurchased online and the bell is a simple cat bell. Both are optional Try to avoid catdog harnesses with the middle chest strap those are a bit more difficult to get on and are easier to get tangled in as well as more restrictive.You want to make sure the harness is snug but not tight. For walks and competitions I try to make sure I can easily slip one of my fingers under the body strap and two in the neck straplike my ring and pinky finger. It may look tight but thats just because rabbits have a lot of fur.Thats just about all I have for now sorry about the wall of text and all the links.

4330300,0,t1_cscsm3r,You had two youngish rabbits die and I share your loss. That was truly awful. Youre almost guaranteed to be doing one or two somethings slightly wrong which need to be identified and remedied. I am hoping you didnt come to this sub for a free pass saying the jumper killed your bunny? I keep getting the impression that you want that from us. What about the other bunny? Being a runt is hardly a death sentence. There may be pathogens or contaminants in your rabbits environment being in a converted mill or you could be looking at GI Stasis. Or you may have to inspect your terrace quite thoroughly for some sort of toxic residue or nonrabbit droppings.Youre currently giving them pellets and seeds once a day. They are getting alfalfa pellets which arent bad per se but they are generally recommended for pregnant females who need extra protein. But it doesnt matter because you said they dont like them. So really they are getting seeds once a day and hay. Is that correct?Your rabbits really would do well with some leafy green vegetables e.g kale collard greens parsely basil carrot greens dill red leaf green leaf and romaine lettuce. If your rabbit starts having loose stools not cecotropes or normal fecal matter then you should cut back to haywater and see what happens. Runny stools or excess cecos are a sign in some rabbits that they had a too rich diet of excess pellets or vegies. Other rabbits are just fine with a richer diet.Seeds arent a good daily food for rabbits. They should be reserved as treats. Treats are good. I am a protreats person but lets be honest rabbits need fresh leafy low carbohydrate vegetables because that is what is appropriate for their digestive system. In addition leafy greens help hydrate your rabbits in case they run out of water or dislike the waters taste and dont drink enough. Better hydration mitigates bad things like bladder sludge too.Also rabbits like to eat twice a day i.e. preferably at dawn and at dusk. On the rrabbits sidebar you will see a warning note that if a rabbit doesnt eat for twelve hours you should take him to a rabbit savvy vet quickly. The note alludes to various things including but not limited to Gastrointestinal Stasis which is very common and very tricky to bring a rabbit back from. It is an all too common cause of death among otherwise healthy rabbits. It is for example with your rabbits far more likely that GI Stasis killed or contributed to the death of your rabbit than the possibility that one was the runt of a litter. Note that Im saying it is a possibility but runts survive and often thrive if properly cared for.Think of what a rabbit can eat in the country side. Do you think wild rabbits naturally avoid leafy greens until they almost sexually mature or is it more likely they eat just about anything green as they transition from milk to solid food? Obviously the latter right? So unrestricted hay with leafy greens and a restricted quantity of pellets is normally what people find works best for their rabbits. ,Rabbits,csdr5lq,1,t5_2riv8

4823793,0,t3_3gx9nz,Hallo well here is what I think  I am not a supporter of these stressbondingstrategies. They are scared and have to process this experience  maybe that is why they didnt fight directly afterwards.  To seperate them during a bondingprocess isnt a good idea either because their fight is interrupted so they always have to restart Bonding is stress for the bunnies and it should never take too long! It isnt impossible that it works out but normally it should not take longer than a week beause otherwise one of the buns already thinks of their area as his teritory and it will be difficult for them to settle... They have to fight it out and if they avoid each other this is no bonding. I am from Germany and I know that bondingrules are handled differently here but until now it worked out for us and other people we know. I did a lot of research before bonding our rabbits and this is the result . The bonding must take place in an area that is NOT the territory of one of the rabbits  it has to be neutral otherwise the owner will always try to defend his space. . You should put food everywhere so they are a little distracted and can eat both. . The space musnt be to big nor too small about qm per rabbit. . They need hidingspots  little houses or boxes  with at least two doors so nobody can be stuck. Important . Dont interrupt the fighting unless they really try to badly hurt each other  sound superhart  is superhart but if you stop it they will always start again because they do not get to find out who the chief is... That is how our bunnies fighted this spring It is tough to watch and we werent sure when to stop too but the experts all say Let them work it out on their own. We slept in the same room so we could interfer when there would have been some kind of life and deathfight... If they scratch each other and there is no blood flowing really deep wounds you should not seperate them.As far as I know they should not smellsee each other two weeks before bonding that is why the method with a fence in the middle to get to know each other is  in theory totally wrong then they have to get to the neutral area at the exact same time. If they smellsee each other now fight and are stopped they will grow aggressions on both sides and the fighting will start over and over again  probably becoming harder because they couldnt end their fighting.Our bunnies had little wounds too If there isnt blood flowing heavily  it is not a problem.Nevertheless I know that other people do not follow these rules and still it works out sometimes... ,Rabbits,cu2ku55,2,t5_2riv8

4828339,0,t1_cu34wkn,gtI guess you like your animals caged and unhappyStop making excuses for you and your GFs lack of ability andor willingness to take PROPER care of a DOMESTICATED animal.  of the people in this subreddit do everything they can to care for their pets small defenseless animals which are entirely dependent on their owner to care for and protect them. And we know our rabbits are happy because we bothered to learn about the animals we voluntarily took into our homes we can read their body language and realize theyre happy when they run to use for attention and treats when they relax and stretch out while being petted and when they run and jump shaking their heads and ears as they play within the safety of the limited space we provide for them. Dont try and shit on us when you dont even have the basic human decency to take your rabbit to a specialized shelter once you got tired of it.

I am not lucky enough to own a rabbit no good space and not enough income to deal with vet bills if anything should go wrong  I live vicariously through rrabbits! D but this reminds me of when I moved to the city Im in now and got a kitten.  The SPCA gave me a voucher for the first vet visit free.  I looked up the vet online and wow those reviews were... not good but hey maybe its just a case of only the unhappy ones complaining right?  Ha ha no.  The vet walked in and from the moment she started the examination I disliked her.  She treated my cat like an object  seemed annoyed with her for moving around and kept shoving her back onto the examination table like she wasnt a living thing.  She talked in a brusque tone to me never once looking at me and if she was looking at the cat looking like she smelled something mildly rotten  and seemed annoyed when I asked her questions.  Obviously when it was time for her one year checkup I found a different vet.  This time I got a vet who baby talked to my cat who answered all my questions giving both myself and my cat her full attention  stroking the cat and calming her down gently moving her back on the table if she tried to get off  my GOD what a difference a good vet can make and what a difference a BAD vet can make!!

5726961,0,t3_3tkfsr,To help allay any fears of having him neutered do your research about rabbit spays and neuters and pick a rabbitsavvy vet to do the procedure.  Isoflurane is a rabbitsafe anesthesia its a different kind from what they give dogs and cats and you should always ask which anesthesia the vet will use on your rabbit prior to the surgeryjust as a test.  Same goes for asking about presurgical prepif they tell you to fast your rabbit DO NOT go to that vetclinic for the surgery.  Other good questions are how many spaysneuters on rabbits theyve done what is the rate of complications duringfrom the surgery theyve experienced when was the last spayneuter on a rabbit theyve done.Knowledge is power and can help you make a better informed decision on his neuter.  Heres a link you may find useful  As for him using your doorway as a litter box have you attempted just limiting access to that doorway?  Im not sure of your houses layout or if it would be feasible but even if its only for a few days to see if you can break the cycle of him going there will force him to choose another spot preferably his actual litter box.  That way he isnt really limited to just his pen and has running around room while you try to retrain him.  The only other option I see is to chase him away from lingering in the doorway if you see him standing in it this would only work if you worked from home since consistency is key. Heres another link that may have more litter box training ideas  Hope these help!,Rabbits,cx6zhfn,3,t5_2riv8

I would bring the males into the house bathroom? and at least split the pen so each female had her own half cage. Plywood boards even sheets of heavy cardboard from boxes will work but you need to do this now otherwise you are going to have a bloodbath on your hands. Ive been there once by mistake you dont want the heartbreak. It will be inconvenient for a bit but its a lot better than dead bunnies everywhere. PS Im not trying to freak you out but rabbits are animals and this is how animals behave. If you can take a deep breathe and get them all rehoused things well be hectic for a bit but everything will turn out fine. ,Rabbits,cxw75jk,1,t5_2riv8
5928889,0,t1_cxwq11j,I actually would strongly recommend NOT using duct tape as it is very sticky and would probably pull out hair that is still fully attached which could be quite painful for him. Rabbit skin is actually very fragile. A safer method would be to use a lint roller or a rubber  nubbed brush. My bun gets these when shes going through a heavy molt and I just gently pull them out. If one is stuck I leave it and try again in a day or so. During the molt I spend several minutes every morning and evening helping her out. ,Rabbits,cxwt47m,2,t5_2riv8

Cant really be done in small claims court if you actually want the Xrays or damages but if you just want your fees back you can go to small claims.In future if you want to keep stuff around have them email a copy TO YOU not just keep it on file themselves.

7204178,0,t3_4e4lq0,The rescue I help at has had and has a number of megacolon rabbits. MC is caused by the KIT gene in the rabbit world its referred to as the English Spotting gene. Only rabbits that get two of the dominant genes will get MC. Very early in the rabbits embryonic development the KIT gene affects the cells migrating from the neural crest in the gastrointestinal tract and the melanocytes cells pigment melanin causing the reduction of colorspots. The problem is the reduced number of neurons in the outer muscle wall in the cecum and ascending colon.  There are a number of things to rule out before MC. Any breed can get this even albinos REWs BEWs amp pointed.  Can you post a picture of your rabbit? The light spotting amp oval poops are normal for an MC rabbit. Other MC rabbits will leak mucus and have stinky poops. There is no real research into care... each MC rabbit will be different. Dont change anything unless a problem develops. There are a larger prectange of males that get this. It can start affecting the rabbit around the age of  to . Find a vet that knows about MC!! This is very important. It is not always treated like just another GI slow down issue.The key is hydration and pain relief!! Some rabbits have very little issues others will need to go on daily GI motility and pain meds. I have been working with a number of people on newer pages  Has pics of rabbits and poop from MC rabbits.. along with all the studies and info you can give to your vet when needed. The old page is more of a storage page of all info surrounding MC. You should always watch your rabbits poop.. just more so for MC rabbits. Along with watching a lack of interest in food and treats... this can be much more serious. ,Rabbits,d1x22ym,2,t5_2riv8

7270046,0,t3_4eyu62,I think Ive heard on here that owning bunnies means redefining you expectations of clean to include hay. As for using hay as litter Ive found that it will get nasty and stinky much quicker than using paper pellets or paper bedding as a base. Cleaning the box will be at least a daily chore even with newspaper or cardboard lining. Also since you have a long haired rabbit expect that hay to get stuck to her little rump and drug around the entire house. My lion head leaves a trail of hay strands everywhere she goes. I bought a Bissell natural sweep carpet sweeper off amazon for  bucks and it works WONDERFULLY for picking up those stray pieces of daily hay. Long or short. Also picks up poops without smashing and spreading. ,Rabbits,d24jz6m,3,t5_2riv8

I am definitely doing my research and making sure this Im ready to commit to taking care of a rabbit. I know its for my mother I still want to be willing and ready as well. But being that specific breed requires more professional care than others I will lean more towards something for a  beginner  or first time owner.

Theyre surprisingly scarce so when you find a good one it feels pretty amazing to have that level of expertise and help. The list youve made is a good one and I agree more people should keep a similar list in the back of their minds... things can happen so quickly with rabbits. But theyre strong little fluffballs! They can push through some of the toughest situations and health issues like it was nothing. They dont give up until its that time and thats one of the many reasons why I love rabbits. In a way they kind of force us to be strong and not give up when things get hard too.Heres hoping your wheelchair arrives soon so mobility wont be such an issue.

8299553,0,t1_d5ewi6i,So they both look like decent foods. I like that the Versele is better about vitamins and supplements although I could see it being more fattening and containing less grass in it then Id like. Controlling the amount I think is key. I think when you feed pellets you should maybe separate them. I read Zelda steals the Linkss food sometimes you dont want fights but just as important is that Link gets the nutrition he needs and Zelda doesnt get too much!Try out different types of hay too maybe they just dont like what they have. But they wont eat hay if they fill up on pellets.My personal routine is to feed veggies in the morning which he eats all of it quickly and restock the hay then pellets before bed and restock hay again if needed. He has all day to get bored and eat hay which he does because there is nothing better to eat. That works for me but obviously youll figure out the best routine for you.When you went to the Vet he swab one or both their noses for a culture test? Pasturella is a very common disease in rabbits and hard to get rid of. They have to be on antibiotics for up to two months in some cases or else they dont get all the way betterrelapse immediately. Meds like penicillin can get rid of it faster but be careful! Penicillin given ORALLY will KILL your rabbit! Im guessing youre in France? in the US we spell Veterinaire Veterinarian.   I have no idea what if any differences there are in French versus USA vet care. So ask about the culture swab or other tests to see whats available. Just as a caution they have to stick that swab WAY up if their nose doesnt bleed they probably didnt swab high enough. Sounds awful but just like doing things like spay and neutering its for their better health. I also saw in your history you clean their box every  days? You may want to clean it daily at least until you get these sniffles cleared up. You may have to move your buns and disinfect their whole area  times a week to get rid of a cycle of reinfection. Are your guinea pigs still sick? are they near your buns at all? they can all share Bordetella bronchiseptica which may or may not make your buns sick. If nothing else it could make them more susceptible to Pasturella.Good luck with everything!!,Rabbits,d5f0331,1,t5_2riv8

The piebalds genes in wild rabbits seem to be very close to the dutchVienna genes in domestics both of which sometimes pop out blue eyes. His nose is very pointed like a cottontail and he has weeeeee tiny feet way too small for even a runt domestic and very thin ears. He also has the greybased agouti coat like a cottontail rather than the more chestnutbased agouti of a domestic. And the pattern of the white spots matches with piebald and doesnt match at all with broken the gene that causes white spots in domestics.If you are worried you can always talk to a wildlife rescue they can tell you for sure. Honestly his chance of survival in the wild is very low either way because of his coloring so if you decided to keep him for a while to get him back on his feet hes not any less likely to survive than if he were on his own. If you want to hold onto him for a bit wild rabbits do ok on a normal rabbit diet of mostly hay with a tiny bit veggies and pellets.

While the urea will be gone theres still the problem of damp fur.I read recently that hand sanitizer was good for cleaning urine off their fur especially their feet because it has a drying agent. Ive used it a couple of times on Hanas weight loss related excess skin rolls which are hard to dry off and its worked a treat.Rub in a little glob with your fingers and then gently with a cloth. By the time youre done rubbing itll probably be mostly dry or will dry very rapidly once youre done.Be careful not to get it on any sensitive areas though or broken skin sore hocks for example. Thatll sting.Do you know why hes dirty? If it becomes a common occurrence then find out whats causing it. Could be a weight or joint issue if he cant clean himself.

9169698,0,t1_d87ybcq,It started like between her ears and along her fat roll lol. Thats why I didnt immediately take her to the vet because I wondered if it was just a heat rash but when the spot got bigger I knew it was more than  that. She also started to get patches on her belly and down around the fixed area. They gave me LimePlus Dip which seems like some sulfur based medication that you dilute with water and then scrub on your rabbit like a shampoo. And yes absolutely you can use this for the wiki! Anything to help a fellow bun parent.

9182681,0,t3_562o00,I found the best way to get in touch with my bun is to lay on the floor and make eye contact from a safe distance for a long time. I add in occasional nose twitches and nonthreatening body adjustment but I never reach out. Keep treats in your hand. If she approaches offer her treats but not pets. First let her know that shes totally safe eating near you and spending time near you. Maybe even read a book but I always found long eyecontact works best.

9183756,0,t3_5633u3,The best treatment for the rabbit itself is Revolution selamectin. There are studies that have looked at Revolution and it works the fastest when compared to Advantage imidacloprid Advantage II adds pyriproxyfen to treat for mites. These two are the go to for most vets.If you are using revolution some vets are still using dosing protocols for dogscats. While the pipette from the mauve box kittenpuppy will work for smaller rabbits with a limited number of fleas... the latest study finds  Veterinarians who were using selamectin based on dog and cat dosages were giving it at too low a dose and less frequently than needed Carpenter said.

Adding a little salt to your boiled water will help kill bugs too. Wipe away what you can with a damp cloth maybe microfibre.Just dry him off as best you can and keep him warm.But if its really spread you might just have to clean as best you can with a dry cloth and gentle brush.

9827242,0,t3_5g05ro,Just to clear it up these vegans you speak of dont believe in pet keeping but they do believe in loving respecting and finding good homes for the domestic animals that are already here. How can you think thats psychotic? I dont believe in pet keeping. I am a vegan. Animals arent our to own and use as we please. I have  rabbits  are special needs and I foster . I also have  dogs. Every single one of them was adopted from rescue or I rescued them myself. They have an excellent home. They are fed an optimal diet they are never caged and never will be they have heaps of room to run around and play and exercise the special needs buns are helped with their grooming daily and each and every single one sees a vet when they need to. I love my animals and consider them my children. I also love farm animals and will never support the exploitation and cruelty of one species whilst I cuddle and care for another. So I am a vegan against pet keeping. Breeders shouldnt exist. Its ridiculous. I dont know why anyone would have an issue with that. Also adopting from a rescue has nothing to do with that anyway. Give a home to a rabbit in need and keep opinions out of it. Go save a rabbit and stop hating on people who value all species equally. ,Rabbits,daoiejs,4,t5_2riv8

9958016,0,t3_5i43f7,Hey! So I recently just did this. I moved to NYC and some of the real estate agents came from a cultural background where rabbits were considered pests. Be aware of that cultural difference and it will help you present your rabbit in the correct way. Some times they dont understand that a pet rabbit is a clean domestic litter trained family member.Honestly none of the landlords I delt with out here over  had a problem with the rabbit. Only the real estate agents. They may have been talking it up to try to get me to spend more for the apartments though.Anyway the best thing you can do is that when you move out ask your landlord to write a letter of recommendation for your pet verifying that it has not caused any damage. It can be short. Something to the extent of As collegeredheads landlord I am pleased to share that during the  years that the tenant owned their rabbit there has not been any damage to the unit and there have been no reports of nuisance. The tenants pet can be considered safe and nondestructive in any home. Also get a letter from the vet stating that the rabbit is in good health and has no behavioral issues. Perhaps ask the vet to explain in the letter that rabbits are clean quiet animals.Honestly some of the landlords laughed when I offered those letters but some of them appreciated it. There was one scenerio when I presented my rabbit as a caged animal similar to a hampster. That was obviously a lie... but the apartment didnt allow dogs and cats only caged animals and fish. The landlord was fine with that. Good luck! ,Rabbits,db5jzpy,4,t5_2riv8

When get home at   I give them there vegetables which they eat everything greedily and give them more hay  and at  clock before I go to bed I give them another plastic spoon of pallets.  Coz I dont over feed them it creates a longing for the food when I do give them. Usually the cnt wait to eat and always eat it al up even their hay they love and eat a lot of so am happy.

11108686,0,t3_5yls2o,Yea definitely just one or two small pieces of carrots per day. Make sure that you stick with leafy greens red lettuce green leaf cilantro but dont overdo it with high calcium veggies like broccoli parsley carrot tops etc. Stay away from fruits especially banana  it makes rabbits gassy if you are giving fruit make sure its a VERY tiny piece as rabbits arent meant to have too much sugar in their diet. Unlimited hay and a pinch of pellets every day is the way to go. Make sure you get your rabbit spayedneutered as soon as heshe is old enough  this will make your life A LOT easier in terms of litterbox training and behavioural issues. It also prevents reproductive cancers and will help your rabbits live a longer life. Theres also a lot of handy information in the sidebar  ,Rabbits,der5rk1,5,t5_2riv8

Its not realistic thankfully because they have a very prey driven dog and not a lot of space for an indoor bunny but even if they didnt have the dog and did have room for the bunny heres my thoughts its not going to be that long until college whos going to care for the bunny? Will your dorm allow pets or are you just going to hope you dont get caught and have to make quick arrangements for your bunny? If you are allowed a pet are your roommates OK with you having a bunny and will your bunny be safe with your roommates? If youre not allowed a pet on campus are you allowed to stay off campus and can you afford to stay off campus and still afford a bunny? Will your bunny be safe with any roommates you have and will it be comfortable aka your roommates have parties where theres loud music and people under the influence you may not know? Will you have time for a bunny especially a single bunny? If not do you have time and money to care for a second bunny?

11525417,0,t3_646rxy,Ive had my bunny for  years and Ive never had a bunny before him nor have I met a lot of bunnies so I wouldnt call myself an expert in this area but I thought Id just try to give some tips from my own experience with my little guy. First of all have your vet checked your bunnies teeth properly? Ive heard that some rabbits refuse to eat hay when their teeth are too long. Not only the front teeth but also the back teeth. Also try not giving any treats at all for a few days. I have had relatives watching over my little guy before and they have given him more treats than I give him and then when he has come home to me again he doesnt want to eat hay as much. But after a few days he goes back to eating normally. I have heard many stories of people giving their bunny way to many treats and because of this theyve stopped eating hay. I dont think you should give your bunny treats just so he or she will eat SOMETHING. Stop giving treats and if your bunny still is not eating hay then when he or she gets hungry you will notice. When my bunny hasnt eaten hay properly he gets tummy ache he sits in one spot and refuses to eat anything at all. A bunnies belly is very sensitive so when a bunny hasnt eaten their stomach system stops working it stops processing food. And when this happens you need to force feed the bunny critical care is a good example of what you can force feed him or her with. This makes the stomach system function again I usually hear a lot of noises from my bunnies belly when it starts working again. This is the only time I give critical care and once a day for a few days after he has had his tummy ache. After that he fully goes back to just eating hay and getting treats just a couple of times a day.Im thinking that if your bunnies health is well and if the teeth are of a good length. Then maybe youve just unawarely gone into a bad circle of giving to many treats and your bunny wants that more than the hay. You should obviously discuss this with your vet as I said I do not have a lot of expertise since my little buddy is my first bunny. But from what Ive learned with my bunny is that too many treats and little hay is not gonna do anything good for the bunnies health. But if you try to stop giving treats and your bunny still does not choose to eat hay when hungry then there definitely needs to be a proper checkup into why your bunny chooses not to eat hay. You can always start with trying just a day to not give any treats. If your bunny does not eat all day then you give critical care and get the bunny to the vet again as soon as possible. Cause it may just be that your little friend there knows that it will get all the delicious stuff anyway and therefor wants that rather than hay. Just my thoughts hope everything goes well with your little friend. Im holding my thumbs  Edit and what I mean by trying for a day if you then notice that your bunny isnt eating and is behaving differently like my example of my bunny when he has tummy aches and just sits in one spot or just different in a bad way then you definitely NEED to give your bunny food give critical care then and not treats. As critical care often is more healthy than most treats.And I need to ask forgiveness for my bad memory noticed now that youve already said that dental looks fine. ,Rabbits,dg2ep26,2,t5_2riv8

11667240,0,t3_66hm7t,Rabbits are very territorial and dont do well next to other rabbits that theyre not bonded to Unless you plan on having them all live together forever your best bet is to either put a barrier up between them or more space between them. ,Rabbits,dgihwic,6,t5_2riv8
