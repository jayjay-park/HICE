I think randuins and ninja tabi is better because it works pretty good vs adcs Randuin   crit dmg reduction reduces attack speed active reduces movement speed and ninja tabi reduces incoming damage from all basic attacks by .

9441472,0,t1_d9cktbf,I definitely have little to no opposition to saying QE will stay dominant. I think R will be pretty strong as a rd evolution but unfortunately I agree with you that R evolve is pretty cheesy if taken early on.Ive been going R first to test it out and it is no doubt FUN but is it stronguseful in comparison to Q or E? Unfortunately Im just not really seeing it unless its a very gank heavy snowball sitution where you are just rolling through the map making picks. In team fighting I think everyone agrees on what kha whats to do he wants to opportunistically move in and out of fights. And r just allows him to do this in a way thats suboptimal to E as far as Ive seen. With E you can E in and E out with a reset or E in and R out if no reset. With R in team fights you are just doing a worse version of that passive R in and active R out shorter range and no reset. I think the big issue with R is the lack of upgrades to the in combat aspect of R. Its really fun moving around the map like that but I feel like every fight with R khazix just wants E instead.I think maybe adding some reset mechanic to R in exchange for a hit to the out of combat portion may be worth entertaining.Further from what Ive seen so far I dont see any reason to not get Q at at least some point. I dont think assassin kha can do much without it. Even non assassin versions will have have a lot of use with Q.,KhaZixMains,d9cruow,1,t5_37re8

11056551,0,t3_5xsz6g,Id say pick up a last whisper item and try to kite and kill their frontline when they dive. It also ight be good to get w second. My reasoning is that if you try to dive you will probably fail and get killed while kiting back with your backline can keep you alive and dpsing longer and it can easily bait the enemy in overdiving. Also last whisper is one of the most efficient items in the game so if you use it properly it can offset your deficit.,KhaZixMains,del8pjv,2,t5_37re8
