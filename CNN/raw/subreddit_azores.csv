6215335,0,t3_40mq96,I cant help you with the first question im not sure what else there is to do at night here besides the bar scenecoing to have a beerWhen it comes to the second question yes you definitely need a car you could tecnically just use buses but there arent enough if you plan on seeing the whole island but i do really recommend renting a car. If you plan on not leaving the city after the tours maybe not since the city at least the parts that matter to you as a tourist are all int he center which is easily done on foot is pretty small you could go to other places at night Ribeira Grande city smaller but its still historic for example,azores,cyw47pe,1,t5_2solj

I see multiracial couples even here in Faial pop.  so I would surely expect that there would be a similarly open attitude in the bigger So Miguel. I have only spent a couple hours chatting with one local multiracial married couple here but they seemed completely relaxed about it and friendly with most everyone.Thats not to say that there is no way that you could experience racism simply because I dont think there is anywhere in the world that that is not possible still. But I would really say you are significantly better off here than in Spain or Italy and possibly better off than large swaths of the UK and the USA.Like PrepK said the Portuguese are in general quite respectful of AfroPortuguese people  the colonies only separated in  and unlike almost all of the other colonizing countries the Portuguese government actually encouraged multiracial marriage during their centuries of colonization so there is already a large amount of multiracial marriages and biracial people.I can also add that one of my best friends is biracial here local Azorean and African and he has never mentioned anything to me about racism.,azores,d9zmuex,1,t5_2solj
