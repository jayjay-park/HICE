IE carrying expensive shit in shady parts of town looking like an absolute tourist DO NOT dress like you are going on a freaking safari america pls and just keep your eyes open as most of the thefts here are pickpocketing or take and run you will most likely not be held at gun point just exploited by oportunist and very fast thieves.,BuenosAires,dazbbvy,5,t5_2r2vr
