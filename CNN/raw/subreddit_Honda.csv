1249284,0,t1_cia0pj2,Asking about reliability in this context is a moot question.  Youre talking about a  year old car and asking if another  year old car that is essentially the same aside from its form is more reliable.  The CRX Civic Hatchback Civic Sedan and the Civic Wagon are all the same vehicle in different form.  they share the same engine transmission ecu wiring steering suspension electronics... etc... I drive my CRX daily and would take it around the word tomorrow but i know it inside and out and know it has been cared for and rebuilt where it wasnt cared for in the past.  Bottom line is one is no more reliable than the other at face value its just a matter of personal preference and reliability is ultimately up to you and how you care for the car. ,Honda,cia5rnt,1,t5_2qwwd

2742320,0,t3_2rd7gb,Google Daniel stern lighting and youll see why plug and play kits are bad.  The only safe and effective way to use an HID system is in a housing designed for them.Also kelvin temp does not have anything to do with the amount of glare produced by a light.  That is solely the function of the housing.  The kelvin temperature is important in other ways but has nothing to do with glare.In short dont put a plug and play kit in your car.  Its ineffective at lighting the road for the driver and produces dangerous amounts of glare for others on the road.

3954203,0,t1_cr6zalh,I dont downvote opinions I downvote how theyre conveyed. Hate and vitriol arent needed.Have you driven a CRZ? Ive met a lot of people who hate them based on reviews...which is fair but Im just curious. A handful of SCCA guys have lapped my CRZ and while nobody would be blown away they were all surprised at how it drives because the numbers on paper arent flattering.  Granted Ive modded the intake and headertest pipe and mine sits lower on coilovers and x.s but the consensus is that the CRZ holds its own and then some with the NA Minis.  It only has hp but about half its torque is  available on demand from the IMA so it doesnt lose speed in corners like most momentum cars do. It has a solid rear axle like the  abarth P but it also has a  weight distribution.  That I can go the route of forced induction and still come out cheaper than an Si is noteworthy.  The HPD kit is costly for what it is though.Im not Japanese but I wonder how they see it through the eyes of a technofile culture that hasnt been as starved for fun Hondas are used to keilow power cars and value evolution over paying homage.  The CRZ won Car of the Year during its Japanese debut and soldsells more than anticipated. Like Ive been trying to say I dont think the CRZ is a failure as a machine and most reasonable people agree. It was destined for a small niche in American markets to begin with and the poorly managed expectations by Honda exacerbated these troubles more than the car itself.,Honda,cr70gwv,1,t5_2qwwd

4789734,0,t3_3ghhvu,Check out the ac compressor clutch relay.  If they stick on when the engine is running the ac will always be on and after a while you will hear a loud grunt as the compressor relief valve is releasing refrigerant.  When the engine is off the relay will cause a steady  amp draw on your battery and kill it quick.  Have the battery checkedcharged first but if it keeps dying I would check out the relay.  The ac noise may also be from the clutch itself.  There is a warranty extension on those ac clutches and coils for  years from date of purchase or k miles for ac performance issues inop ac or noise from the compressor area.   is the bulletin number.  ,Honda,ctya9oz,2,t5_2qwwd

Some of the prototypes were such gorgeous cars but I honestly am not feeling the car now. Its just..bland. The original NSX looked gorgeous when it was first released and still looks beautiful today. I dont think this car will do that. It may seem pretty for a few years but the styling isnt going to remain timeless like the original.

4819351,0,t3_3gtocg,I drive an FA never driven a Fit so take this all with a grain of salt.  Actually I live in Ontario Canada so take that with a lot of salt shitty roads and neverending winter.  This is a bit of a brain dump but hope it helps you in your decision.I dont commute with my Civic I live downtown so it sits a bunch have the equivalent of about  miles on mine its a .  I drive to get places but am willing to pay a bit to have fun on the way.  I find the Civic to have a firm ride bordering on harsh at times mine is stock apart from an Injen SRI that was installed by the original owner I bought the car from in  with  K miles on it.The car is an absolute blast to drive though.  I hate driving anything else.  My girlfriend just bought a  Mazda  hatch Skyactiv with the  speed manual.  Its boring to drive.  I think it has more torque down low than the FA but it just feels like a complete dog being that Im used to the FA.  If youre stuck in traffic on the freeway and want to merge into moving traffic from a stop unless you assault the FA the lack of torque can be annoying but by no means dangerous I feel a GTi or similar would be better in this area.  I also dont look forward to the  premium in gas over the Mazda  as the FA requires  octane but its a small price to pay for having a car I love the hell out of.  The VTEC crossover is just goofy gets me every time and noncar people riding with me are always just like wtf.  One thing Id suggest is buy one you can stand to assault and destroy.  I bought a low mile great condition one tafetta white but I got a steal of a deal.  Im anal about my cars though.  I park in the middle of nowhere in parking lots I worry about dings the one time I just grazed a post when I was backing up and scuffed the rear bumper  I still havent forgiven myself.  All that said I maintain the hell out of the car as lots of preventative stuff is so cheap to do.  I change the MTF annually as it costs  and the rd gear is apparently shit on these cars Ive never had an issue but most I notice that when cold like been sitting outside for hours and covered in snow  mine is normally kept in underground heated parking the transmission is super notchy.  Ive only ever replaced with OEM Honda MTF in a few weeks Ill be trying Amsoil to see if this helps.  Oh and FYI there was a paint recall on the blues blacks and some other colours if I recall.  The paint develops crows feet or something and starts peeling or cracking cant remember which.  Honda extended the warranty on them personally Id lowball anyone selling one of those colours because Im a heartless SOB.,Honda,cu20oqt,2,t5_2qwwd

What happens is that over time the heat causes the plastic inside to crack around the screws so the screws are only holding up the pieces of plastic that broke off causing the rest of the panel to sag. Youve probably got maybe one or two screws left actually holding up the panel.I just replaced it. It was practical for me because that panel is actually two parts in the TL.

5324495,0,t3_3nwjve,OOOH OOOH OOOH I know the answer have owned both wrenched extensively on the Del Sol and have had my  Prelude SH since July. Ill start with the Del Sol. First roof leaks happen they can be solved easily with some silicone beading or a new set of seals both super easy stuff. Del Sol comes in three flavors S Si and VTEC. S model is the Db block single cam . liter engine non vtec rear drum brakes. This was my first car and it had a  speed manual super easy and fun to learn on. However only made about  hp to the wheels and had very little get up and go and the T top meant a lot of frame rigidity issues. Upsides to S trim is that its a d series engine parts are everywhere and its all dirt cheap. VTEC trim was my second Del Sol and this came with  disc brakes upgraded suspension and a Ba which is the . liter Dual overhead cam engine. Made about  hp to the wheels and with improved suspension and braking handled like a go kart. Downside is both cars had almost no torque. Del Sols are a great daily commuter and pretty good on gas even if you like to drive aggressively. Biggest downside to the Del Sols was the cost of bodywork. Some of the body parts are really hard to find now and are super expensive. My VTEC Sol was in the shop for  weeks for basic body work. Other than the bodywork Del Sols have a pretty low cost of ownership.Prelude is just hands down a nicer car. Has more room with the two back seats and even though it is like  pounds heavier the  hp and significant torque increase is noticeable. Mine has leather interior which is another nice touch. The downside to the prelude is that even though its arguably a better car the cost of ownership is seriously higher.  a month more for insurance tires are s which means a set of tires worth putting on the car is a minimum of  bucks. Also the engines are more complex and they drink oil like nobodys business so getting work done on them is seriously more expensive. Also yeah no prelude automatic slushboxes.For either one of these you should be buying the  speed.Finally what do you actually want to do with it? Long distance commuter daily driving project eventually turbo? Those are all factors that come into it for me and I can give you pointers if you have more specific questions.,Honda,cvs9l4l,4,t5_2qwwd

5689819,0,t3_3t1st7,If youre buying a car from a dealer it should be mechanically sound so it shouldnt have a wheel bearing issue.Look at the brakes are the pads low all the way around? You can tell by looking through the spokes if it has aluminum rims. Good brake pads should have about a half inch of material on them. If theyre low all the way around it will make the fluid low as well and chances are its time for them to be replaced.  If theyre not low theres a chance theres a leak. This could be a leaky brake line caliper or wheel cylinder if is has drum brakes in the rear. Either of those are major issues which need addressing. Basically  or not the car should be in safe running and driving shape when you buy it from a dealer of any sort. It should also have a very limited warranty depending on the state that youre in.

6073947,0,t3_3yp7f5,Auto tech here get the code number pulled and post it. More than likely if the snow had enough force to tear the splash guard off it had enough force to partially unplug a sensor likely o but who knows.The chances you had a sensor go bad is almost zero. The chances they accidentally fucked something up just by removing the splash guard should be literally zero. The chances a shady flatrate tech which most dealership technicians are on a slow day unplugged something to make the CEL come on and hope that youd not argue and just pay to have a sensor replaced and just plug it back in is actually plausible.These cars also happen to be EXTREMELY sensitive when it comes to MAF sensor readings. Aftermarket intakes eventually cause problems. My guess is Honda dialed in some overly aggressive settings in the ECU to boost what they could advertise for MPGs and the result is an extremely particular MAF sensor that doesnt like readings that are anywhere close to outside factory.,Honda,cyfs4sg,1,t5_2qwwd

6674235,0,t1_d09mnif,We had an .  Traded it right around k miles.  From what I recall the only issues we ever had was a bad alternator rusted fittings on the radiator that caused a leak and a slight vibration in the axle.  The axle issue was never addressed no dealership could ever do much but it wasnt an issue.  The radiator fittings were an issue with Ridgelines and Pilots do look for that.  Make sure the timing belt and water pump were changed around the  mark.  If not itll cost  give or take to have done.  Other than that some trim pieces never fit right but it is otherwise a very dependable vehicle.  Brakes are easy to replace and you can easily replace the spark plugs and do a transmission fluid changevtm fluid change if you need.  We had an  Ridgeline too that shared many components.

7151109,0,t3_4dhqx4,After  years it was time to retire my trusty old  Civic Type R EP and get something new. After six months of waiting it finally arrived and boy! It does not disappoint...The old EP wasnt a slow car by any means but the new Type R plays another game entirely. To top it all off the car is quite practical as well. Thanks to the magic seats my  feet can theoretically sleep in the trunk comfortable. Last weekend the weather was good enough to do some serious driving at last. So i tested the timing features of the board computer and got . from  kmh which is . seconds better than what Honda promises and I am pretty sure I can shave of some more off of that time since I had mighty wheel spin while changing from first to second. Quarter mile time was . which seems OK to me  although this time isnt perfect either. I am looking forward to see how fast it really goes on a straight lane on one of the next weekends when the sun comes up a little earlier. I had to learn that I am not really comfortable to drive faster then  or  kmh on the Autobahn at night. You see the corners too late in the dark and although those corners arent really sharp its kinda hard to keep your lane. In the afternoon there is simply to much traffic where I live to go flat out for a prolonged time so up until now the fastest the speedometer has shown was  for a fraction of a second. From GPS Data I know that true  need  on the speedometer. I am pretty sure it will go faster than that  at least downhill.If you guys have any questions I will be happy to answer them.Edit Pics of the engine bay the rear doors and the magic seats.

7247630,0,t1_d218f74,Im not sure exactly because of the dollar and the market over there  every year they get harder and harder to find but there was a guy in Quebec who imported one from France because of all the RHD hate going on in OntQue with insurance and registration. He was actually selling it on Kijiji too. But they also sold CRXs in Portugal some are even cop cars there and Sweden too iirc. Id definitely hit up some of the overseas Honda forumsFacebook groups and check out the prices. Id be willing to bet theyre not much more than importing from Japan with the shipping. Probably a little more once they land in Canada because theyd probably hit port in Nova Scotia vs BC so the costs would increase for Canadian rail shipping. Its funny Alberta Transportation had a survey out a year ago or so that had some questions about whether citizens wanted RHDs to be banned or severely limited on Alberta roads. The wording of the questions were quite biased and leading. Then the election happened and I havent heard anything more about it... Couple that with the hard time I had insuring my EF as most companies would only cover PLPD. I had to get an appraisal and even thats not a guarantee Ill get anywhere close what its really worth if anything happens. And then with ICBC getting tougher on them too its only a matter of time I think before Alberta gets into the mix. All its going to take is FSMforbid one headlinegrabbing accident to kickstart it. Like I said I bought my CRX as an enthusiast and collector and I love it dearly. Ill keep it for the rest of my life. But if I had to do it all over again I dont think i would import another RHD into Canada. Id rather spend the little bit of extra cash and modify another LHD one like the one I had before I imported this one or Id import a LHD one  less attention from the authorities that way. ,Honda,d2205sj,1,t5_2qwwd

7594752,0,t3_4jahtl,I wouldnt put any money down on a lease ever.  If your car gets totaled the GAP insurance will pay off the remaining balance due but you will be out much more money than a  down lease.  Lets say the lease is  with  down or  with k down and you total the car  months into the lease.  With the month option you will have spent  total on the car vs  with the k down payment.As far as negotiating on those particular cars I have no idea as I havent looked at prices since I leased my  civic last year.  The one thing I can say is if those are the prices they initially offered you can definitely get a better deal.  Did you negotiate the price down before saying you wanted a lease? normally get a better deal this way.  Also make sure you take a look at things like the residual and money factor pretty much the interest you pay.  If you can negotiate a higher residual normally not likely but you never know or a lower money factor read into what this really means as they will usually try to lie to you about what it is the formula for MF is unnecessarily complicated and annoying  then your monthly payments will be less. TLDR  Negotiate price before saying you want a lease try to put  down if possible try and negotiate the MF and Residual terms if you can though usually with Honda Financial as long as you have good credit they are reasonable terms since the cars hold their value ,Honda,d35hgzt,1,t5_2qwwd

Is the actual switchstalk physically broken or is the switch ok and the left turn signal doesnt work when using the switch?  FWIW you dont really mess with much when replacing those inflators.  Its two bolts from the side and they pop right out.  The headlight switch harness recall you actually do a wire repair to the harness.  The wire you are repairing is for the low beams and not anything to do with either turn signal. If it was something they did this is when it would of happened.  I seen some stupid techs before but I cant think how that could of happened.  When you bought it back did they tell you what the problem was?  Id imagine they took the column covers off and checked the connector and the wiring they touched with the recall.  If that is all set and ok then its most likely just a coincidence.  ,Honda,d56816v,2,t5_2qwwd

8469426,0,t3_4vo7ri,They may have told you  weeks because they were backed up on work.  I work for a non appointment dealer and all the surrounding dealers will push their warranty work off for weeks and they all come to us.  By Thursday Im usually ready to blow my brains out.  We never say no but customers always act surprised when we dont drop what were doing and get their car in before the  people sitting in the waiting room. Looks like you got a moron adviser and an idiot tech to work on your car.  Well the adviser may be over worked but still a moron for how he handled everything.  The tech could be overworked but hes an asshole for letting the car go like that.  I hate my fucking job but Id never let a customers car leave like that.  Im referring to both the mechanical issue and the grease and papers left inside.  In reality a good tech could do all that in a day or two but greedy pig dealer owners dont like to pay technicians the money they deserve so you end up with a shop with a handful of good experienced techs and the rest are UTI dipshits who think diagnosing is asking people around the shop if they ever seen anything like it and could care less about your car.  The sooner they get it out of their stall they can go back to facebooking and pokemoning.    I wouldnt waste your time talking to the sales manager unless hes your friend because he has no say in the service department.  You want to talk to the service manager and if that doesnt get you anywhere the general manager.  Blast them up on some review sites like Google Yelp and others and there is a very very good chance you will get a phone call.  At least my GM calls everybody that leaves a bad review and tries to make it right.  Sucks you had a bad experience but not all dealers techs and advisers are the same.  Id say if your next experience is good just only deal with that particular adviser in the future and even ask for the same tech to work on your car.  ,Honda,d607ugu,7,t5_2qwwd

Im talking one knock on the top of the dashboard and it moved upwards driving on a bumpy road. This is another known issue but with no fix other than waiting for the plastic to get cooled off by the Ac which leads back to the first issue lol. Its only the middle left vent the others are fine. Make sure the door interior plastic are fine with no scratches. I have a few scratches on the plastic bottom of the door but Im not  they dont look like something I wouldve done.

Unless youre planning to spend big money think Rocket Bunny or Liberty Walk theyre all going require significant massaging to get them to fit even remotely close to well the styling is going to look like some crap out of The Fast and The Furious and its probably to require far too many wood screws to attach.  The other option would be a lip kit which isnt a full body kit and will just stick on to the bottom of the stock bumpers.

Aero suspension light wheels sticky tires chassis stiffing and a b series swap is considered rice? Since when is functionality considered rice?

From looking at it from the pictures..the rear bumper was replaced side markers are not OEM  Common things that go bad on this car are the front aarm bushings shifting might be notchy at higher miles steering rack might be bad and car will pull to the right or make weird noses it has electric steering sometimes the auto window on the driver side will make the window bounce down after it rolls up  and for the  models the cams had problems with scoring or premature wear. ask if its been replaced. if not..you might have to do it and youll get a set of upgraded cams from honda or just use the ones from the  ep. they are good cars just lame for making fast,Honda,ddodnuu,2,t5_2qwwd

10983567,0,t3_5we6zl,gt Im currently in the market for a new car and looking at cars like the BRZ GTI Focus ST WRX and the Civic si of course.I was in the same boat as you a few months ago.  I needed a new car and I decided on something sporty.  I presume from your choices that youre looking at a daily driver with the occasional back roadcanyon runtrack day?The BRZ while great is a very underwhelming car to drive as a daily driver.  Its really more of a track cardrift car.  You really have to push it to enjoy it.  Its got a hatch but it really doesnt have a whole lot of cargo space and the rear seats are only good for cargo.  Also the  BRZ and Toyota  recommend  octane.  It will run on  just fine with no knock but if you want to push it you have to use  octane gas.I would remove the GTI from the equation.  Reliability is a huge problem with VW especially the GTI.  GTI owners will always try to justify their car by saying well as long as you make sure you change out all the head gaskets camshafts get oil changes every  miles or less get a new radiator installed a new water pump etc etc it wont give you any problems and this is for brand new cars.The Focus ST is nice drives great has a ton of power on tap is fairly reliable and is practical as regular compact with a lot of great options but I test drove it and I couldnt get past how cheap the car felt both inside and out.  It still has that cheap American economy car build quality that has plagued the USDM for over  decades.  The Recaro seats are a great option and the fact that you can snag them pretty cheap now that demand for the RS is huge is something to consider.  The WRX is your typical WRX.  It is fast.  Its faster than the base model STI but doesnt handle as well.Now heres the thing.  The new Si is not going to be like the previous generations with a high revving VTEC motor that screams at  RPM and gets  MPG if you short shift it.  Its going to be a turbo . and that means its going to have more torque but its also lost that Honda personality. So it really comes down to the WRX and the Si.  I would honestly say that you should go for the Si just because the current Civic base platform is all around better than the current Impreza.,Honda,decyatv,2,t5_2qwwd
