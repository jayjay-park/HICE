10339240,0,t1_dceqj2q,His comments seem like hes racist or pretending to make it about race to deflect the attention that hes just an asshole who might have something to do with a missing woman he was an aquantiance with. I hope they find her alive and unharmed. This case has a lot of us in Michigan sleuthing the hell out of it! ,MissingPersons,dcg0ffn,1,t5_2qxgd
