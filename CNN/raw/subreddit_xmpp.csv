7816653,0,t1_d3uh1r8,if only i could but the employer is kind of wierd when it comes to requirements.first of all it needs to be .Net Framework . as he needs to implement the code into his special program that needs to run on Xp machines with only .Net .second it needs to be  owned by them the client and server part so they can sell it.third it needs to be easy to be compatible with the Avaya Chat client that runs custom tags.i already told him that all the ideas are bad. but he is fine with it and i get a lifetime of payed support service for some code he wants to be dynamic i guess it is a winwin? hopefully i can change his mind on .Net . but i doubt it as he needs to upgrade  computers if that has to happen.,xmpp,d3unn1n,1,t5_2qkzi
