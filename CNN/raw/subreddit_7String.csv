My roomate has a dual rec roadster combo though that I can try it on.  Been working  hour shifts since I got it and havent had a chance.

743373,0,t3_22nsv7,Just taking a shot in the dark here but I was looking up the specs and neck material is both maple and walnut. Ive also noticed its a rare guitar in the U.S. The guitar has been discontinued meaning there are only a limited amount of them around. I may be wrong but I do see it as an overpriced guitar at that  value. However you got it at  off I think you got a good deal. Ive got a Dean RCX which cost around  and it has very similar set up. As long as your happy with it why complain? You got a solid  string for a decent price.,7String,cgorywv,3,t5_2syol
1081813,0,t1_chr8ayd,Most likely. Active routes are bigger than any passive routes Ive ever seen so most passive pickups should fit most active routes. But like I said if you go with passive pickups youll most likely want to get some pickups rings to fill in the gap left unless you dont mind it.EDIT Also and your tech should know this but if youre switching from active pickups to passives you need a different input jack for your guitar and you need to drill a hold to ground your bridge. You may also want to go with k pots which seem to get along better with passive pickups.,7String,chr96ox,1,t5_2syol

4684668,0,t1_ctl141j,Yes the  highest strings would get tuned up a step. I just wondered if going only half a step up on the high E would make a difference versus going to full step up. Part of the reason I asked is for the sake of string tension. The . I already have on there is holding surprisingly well but I figure a . would be the better bet in the long run. I know it sounds silly to even ask but I have not experimented with this until today nor have I found anybody whom has actually done this before. It probably has been done before I just cant find any examples that easily yet.Thank you for your response.,7String,ctl1qhb,1,t5_2syol
