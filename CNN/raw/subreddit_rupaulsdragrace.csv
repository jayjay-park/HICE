562403,0,t1_cg3lbia,Its not about you being uninformed its about you making statements like Adore just happens to have more natural talent. You either have a talent or you dont. To then say that theres such a thing as more talented only serves to discredit the work that people have done to develop their talent. Ive been told my entire life that Im simply more talented than other people and that Im a failure who sells himself short by not working harder when the truth of it is that I do work hard and Im very successful in achieving what I want to achieve artistically. Its like Jinkx not getting due credit for her comedic skills from the other queens in season . More talented is a myth and it does no favors to anyone.I also take issue with the idea of a good voice or better voice. Courtney and Adore each have a voice and they each know how to sing which is a talent. I think the difference between a trained musician and an untrained musician manifests in the kinds of work that musicians end up doing. Untrained musicians tend to work on the specific things about music that they find interesting and trained musicians tend to be given more systematic criticism from other people and therefore work on things that they wouldnt have worked on by themselves because it wouldnt have necessarily occurred to them to work on those things on their own. In that way I also think that the work that untrained musicians do can be redundant because they tend to work on things that theyve already mastered  they may work hard but they tend not to work smart. I think Adore comes across as untrained to me and to you given your previous comment? more than Courtney does although I really have no proof that Courtney has any training at all. What I think can be observed objectively though is that Courtney can produce a more rapid vibrato than is ever seen in untrained singers and her upper range is INCREDIBLY developed for a male singer in a way thats basically impossible without mastery of breathing technique. I think there is a student in just about every high school across America with a choral program worth a damn that have about the same amount of training that Adore does. I think there are probably mere hundreds perhaps even tens of men on the planet who can do what Courtney does Jinkx Monsoon Varla Jean Merman and perhaps Lady Bunny included. That isnt to say that I think Courtneys voice doesnt have its shortcomings but I think its obvious that she has really worked on it. I made no assumption that you dont listen to opera. I just think Adores vocal shortcomings become more apparent when compared sidebyside with an opera singer because opera is arguably the most demanding genre of vocal music. Opera singers have to do the work by necessity in a way that is kind of optional for pop singers. In that way most working opera singers know how to breathe better on average than Adore seems to which could make the problems with her breathing more apparent when listening to them sidebyside. I dont think Courtney is enough better at breathing that Adores deficiencies become all that obvious when comparing them. I think a great example of this phenomenon is Kathy Griffin getting a voice lesson from Seth Rudetsky and Kristen Chenoweth,rupaulsdragrace,cg4793l,1,t5_2t3or

I dont recall many if any complaints when she won. On the flip side EVERYONE was pissed that Tyra won over Raven. The amount of people who were rooting for Tyra could probably be counted on one hand. Thats why Ive never believed or supported this idea that AllStars was designed for Chad. Chad has a great relationship with Sharon supports her and has never seemed bitter over the loss. I think the conspiracy is pretty tinfoil hat crazy but to me if AllStars was designed for ANYONE to win it was Raven  however how could Raven have logically won after being in the bottom  for for literally half of the competition?,rupaulsdragrace,cg4viz7,2,t5_2t3or

572896,0,t3_20ot5l, Adore  She should have much better control over her voice than she does for someone who went that far on classicera AI. Her performance was otherwise pretty good like last week. Runway betrayed her personal style without excelling at the theme. Having said that Im rooting for her.  April  A perfect example of an amazing drag queen whos a subpar Drag Race queen. She will go far afterwards.  Ben  My second favorite tonight for the challenge didnt like the runway. He seems a bit bored so far? Or maybe theyre just not focusing enough on him. Bianca  Even in the small role she had her Broadway polish shined through. She knows how these things work. Courtney  Was actually impressed with her theatricality deserved the win . She also knows exactly how these things work and how vocals work within limitations. Darienne  I was surprised that she did so poorly here. Her runway was fabulous tho Gia  Her timing was the only thing that seemed off and that might have just been Darienne. Still she needs to read up on some pop culture.  Joslyn   Laganja  Maybe the Detox of this season? Slow start promising middle fumbled end? That would explain the strange edit shes been getting. Milk  I just dont know. He has a lot of good concepts but seems to struggle putting them into the context of the show and hes not doing too hot with the challenges either. Still rooting for you. Trinity  Theres a lot of talent there and her singing was actually pretty good. If she can come out of her shell shed be amazing.

Im sure Laganjas grating personality became even more annoying in that kind of environment so I can kinda see why with a bit of prodding from a producer probably the queens werent aiming for tact in dressing her down.  Even so I thought the tone of the other queens was a little too zealous to be taken as constructive criticism.

If there was a tv show full of straight males that casually made use of the word faggot in a playful manner I think all of us would agree that that usage hurts us as a community.  It turns us into a joke instead of real breathing people.  And the same thing happens with these slurs that are hurtful to the trans community.  Its easy to forget when they arent used against us personally but we have to remember that there is a lot of historical and emotional weight behind words. Many times these words have been yelled violently at trans people as they have been beaten to death by their oppressors.

I dont think there was any need to junk the SheMail segment but if its an easy enough way of mending fences with the trans community then its absence is fine.

No one redeemed themselves rocking out to some uninspired top forty hit. Did anyone do amazingly better than the other? No. There really wasnt much talent displayed in tonights lipsync especially in comparison to previous lipsyncs from this season.Whats left to judge is their performance in challenges with the greatest weight being put towards this weeks challenge. Darienne did tremendously bad Dela did fair. Dela has out performed Darienne in pretty much every challenge other than standup challenge.Darienne has most certainly had superior lipsyncs to Dela. Though Delas looks alongside her performances in the challenges have been leagues better than Darienne. So the question does Darienne deserve to stay because she did a better lipsync? In my opinion no. Though youre not wrong at all! We all weigh aspects of the show differently. Though who cares what we think its up to RuPaul!,rupaulsdragrace,ch4tojh,9,t5_2t3or

Of all the returning queens she came off looking the worst. Maybe half of her jokes landed and even the ones that did suffered due to that voice which moved further and further away from Michelle Visage and closer to bad Joan Rivers impersonation. I want nothing but success for Sharon but after the RuCap I feel like she probably needs to freshen up her act a bit.

1071239,0,t3_26dio8,Well its you againOf course this kind of post will come up and I could totally understand why because her humor as an insult comic will not be everyones cup of soup tea.  But the fact that you are able to repeat pretty much all of Biancas jokes shows how much time youve invested in watching all of her shows on Youtube.  So I guess youre secretly a fan of Bianca too?  Because as a big fan myself I watched a lot of her shows that I can finish her jokes sentences lol.She works almost every single day of course as a comedian she will have a certain template that she runs with because thats her schtick.  And she works mostly in a nightclub setting where tons of people come to a gay bar on a weekday at midnight to see her performance.  They know all of what she says is a joke and clearly they have a sense of humor to know that its not bullying as you perceived.  The most hilarious parts of her shows are of course the candid parts where the audience can make her laugh and she is caught off guard.  If you see her performance in Canada you will get to hear new things since its obvious that all the jokes she did for her US shows wont land in other countries.Without a doubt she is funny witty and quick as hell.  During the season she can make people laugh every episode without relying on the jokes you listed.  If people cant take what she says on her shows then they shouldnt bother watching them.  Remember as a man in a wig and his balls tucked in his ass doing this for  years the biggest joke is clearly Bianca herself kk?,rupaulsdragrace,chq1yrx,2,t5_2t3or

Shes got great artistic sensibilities when it comes to her personal style and dance we arent going to talk about her jewelry line because I would only wear one of those pieces and it was the one without fucking pot leafs on it and she is genuinely a sweetheart that kind of flies under the radar second episode how lucky were we to spend the first episode with our sister Kelly yall?.But.Theres also a lot of times where her taste is somewhat questionable which pretty much comes down to whatever she stole from the hotel that day and the parts where her emotional side takes a turn for the worse are absolutely unbearable to sit through. Shes also not terribly selfaware which is unfortunate because in my opinion selfawareness is the only way you can get success.I have love for her and I think people go too far sometimes when it comes to making fun of her but she still needs improvement.

Ganja also did a fine job of the foundation and eye makeup Im happy to see her improve like that. This was way less of a trainwreck than I initially feared.  My only problem here is her slamming Pageants about two minutes in.   We get it its not everyones thing and really doesnt have to be but Im afraid that if the Ru girls keep on publicly dissing Pageants the mainstream audience will eventually perceive them as the worst thing ever and as a lesser form of drag which imho is really unfair towards all the fierce Queens that devote their life to this form of expression and a huge disservice to drag in general.  Just my two cents. ,rupaulsdragrace,cigj7xn,5,t5_2t3or
1306028,0,t3_290ezj,YAY Makeup threads! Hmm. This last season I hated the shade of blush DeLa used and the fact that her contour was SO pink. In some episodes she looked sunburned. Joslyns makeup has improved since her time on the show but during it it seems like she used lipgloss on areas where she over lined her lips which made her mouth look messy. As well she generally used too much white eyeshadow under and around her eyes. ,rupaulsdragrace,cigjmhg,3,t5_2t3or

1371737,0,t3_29ssxc,Shangela and Laganja knew  what they were doing ok for Laganja it was at LEAST  knowing what she was doing. There is ZERO doubt in my mind that they were not to a large degree both playing to the cameras and getting their screen time up there. Not faulting them either. I loved both of them on the show. But they were the MOST prepared for the show IMO. I refuse to believe that Laganjas character was not created specifically for the show. Adore basically said as much.Jiggly...was just Jiggly. OP seems to really have it out for poor Jiggly. She wasnt as prepared as some of the other girls for the emotional side of things but she hardly went around Laganjaing all over the place. I hardly think she deserves a mention next to many other queens in this thread.IMO this thread  belongs to Trinity. With a couple more years under her belt she would have SAILED to victory IMHO. The only thing holding her back WAS the emotional stuff. Her runway her lipsync her makeup her comedy her wit....its all there.

The worst performer in the challenge is automatically in the bottom two. Then the rest vote someone into the bottom two. Then it would come down to the lipsync. So you could potentially go from being the second best of the week to being eliminated but thats what would make it so cutthroat.

Specifically how do these people define drag if they think the show is misrepresenting it or is it just sour grapes because they feel their type of drag was not appreciated?If its a matter of objecting to WOW having involvement in their career  then the obvious answer is stay off the show. Its not like WOW is forcing anyone to work for free. Of course theres producer manipulation but its a reality show more than it is a contest. A lot of the queens have benefitted enormously from the show and are making more money than any drag queen might have dreamed of  years ago  and even the audition rumours etc give national exposure to local queens that might never have been encountered outside their local market. ,rupaulsdragrace,ciw29v6,9,t5_2t3or

During the Reality TV roundtable that included RuPaul that was already posted here.The clip that came AFTER the interview where RuPaul states how hes amazed how the editors string it all together and that this season came totally prepared because most of them grew up on reality TV.

1613720,0,t1_cji8w5k,I have several problems with this article but of course Im biased. First whenever the discussion turns to Lady GaGa the notion of imitation and copying comes up and Ive got serious issues with the way people apply these concepts to the GaGs. Lady GaGa is not imitating these individuals persay rather it is an act of emulation which is a fine yet specific difference. All great artist emulate because as the saying goes the greats build upon the shoulder of giants. Perhaps the simplistic way to think about it is When you emulate someone you are not just copying his or her actions you are additionally trying to meet or exceed that persons achievements.Its also useful to understand and this is a technical term the idea of contaminatio being the seamless melding of the motifs and formal characteristics of several examples. Theres never or rarely just ONE reference going on. Shes often creating a conversation through the references which are building towards a greater direction.Now lets look specifically at this line.gt These younger queer generations are taking these postmodern figures and texts at face value and ignoring that they are born from a history of queer predecessors.Considering this is one of the authors complaints I dont quite understand why he is criticizing Lady GaGa since she above any of her peers acts as a literal walking textbook for the past queer artist and figure who shes constantly referencing. Shes so heavy handed youre meant to be able to trace these references back to their predecessors. These are the images and figures who have created the entity we know of as Lady GaGa today. Like Ru says in RusponsitrannityInternet Video Television StereoWhat you are is what you knowHeard it on the radio...Everything you are on the radioEverything you know on the radioWe use these images and artifacts that we consume to craft our own identities. Theyre one of those raw materials that people use to fashion and understand themselves. Not only is Lady GaGa literally showing us the stuff shes been fashioned from by making all these references which an interested individual can easily trace back and further learn about if they are so inclined which is another long standing purpose of art that being that it is didactic teaching. but also provide a plethora of material for younger generations to experiment with.gt Our relationship to gay and queer icons is no longer intimate but fragmented. We are no longer creating a gay icon out of the full embodiment of an entertainer but we are actively breaking the persona into aesthetic parts and pieces.I dont even understand this part of what theyre saying. Esp in connection to Lady GaGa. Part of the initial fuel that got GaGa into the mainstream was the queer community. When she was opening for NKOTB North America amp The Pussycat Dolls in Europe to pay for all her show shit shed go out and perform at whatever local gay club there was. Shes like a modern day Bette Midler who if you didnt know refined her chops and started by performing in gay Bathhouses. To say that GaGa wasnt born out of a close and intimate relationship with the gay community supporting an individual who is a quintessential embodiment of an entertainer is ludicrous and ignorant of GaGas origins.This person is so wound up in the disparate  images shes producing that they fail to notice the overarching narrative shes crafting which has at times served as a sharp critic against the very things hes complaining about the Telephone music video is probably the most apt example.Yet another trite complaint about shit the author doesnt really understand. Fame is not a steady thing. It has dips and lulls. Weve yet to see if GaGa will be oldschool and have a longlasting career but from what Ive seen so far I think shes one of the better bets. ,rupaulsdragrace,cjikr3t,5,t5_2t3or

PR queens are some of the best out there but they either seem to get fucked over by the fellow contestants or producers or theyre able to fuck themselves over when it comes to the show. Please let that not happen this time. All the PR queens whos been on the show are amazing performers but that doesnt always translate to the show unfortunatly. Some come more prepared then others while some are less fit for the show but its about time a PR queen really breaks through.,rupaulsdragrace,ck4w1fr,9,t5_2t3or

Compared to other queens who have been at it for years such as Chad Bianca Darienne Raja Latrice for the amount of time she has spent doing drag she really looked rough unoriginal pedestrian Something she may have been trying to remedy at the reunion by wearing three outfits at once? And she wore a fucking fedora in confessionals or a bucket hat or whatever the hell that shitty thing is on her head.

Does putting out a shitty single as a drag queen hurt your image? Probably not insofar as the public will just know that youre not a great singer. After all you may not be a singer or a damn seamstress but you can still be a fierce queen.,rupaulsdragrace,clgd19c,3,t5_2t3or

2497038,0,t3_2o7ij0,gtqueens might really get good advice and take away something of value to build their act...This is the one problem with RPDR. Its not about their acts. Just about showing what youre working with and handing you a platform.Itd be more interesting to see them do their gig along with RuPauls life storychallenge thing but thats a different show. Then again a large percentage of them dont really have anything unique so its a pipe dream plus the show is only under an hour so theres no time to substitute something in there when they have a quick  second runway instead. PLUS theyd essentially need  or so unique performances prepared and at this point bitches cant even get one Snatch Game together with  years notice. I personally wouldnt be into another straight womans opinion full time especially one whos entire resume is about fashionish stuff and reporting on  Pound Ovarian Tumors but YMMV but really gurl think about it. For me Mike Ruizs single statement about his own life after Rajas Power of Fuck You speech was more memorable and powerful than anything Merle or most of the other judges contributed in most seasons. I also think this idea of having working drag queens will never work they are their active competition. With only a couple of exceptions. ,rupaulsdragrace,cmki1va,0,t5_2t3or

2692611,0,t1_cna1c42,As a viewer of both of those shows I definitely agree. Even though drag has so much possibility its sadly limited by the confines of Logo and frankly by television. Drag is meant to be witnessed experienced at a club bar or pageant venue. You can only glean so much of that into a television stage and Im afraid that the show is starting to run its course. An example here is Snatch Game. Now this may be biased talking since Tatiannas Britney is my ultimate favorite but the best was the original. By the third iteration Snatch Game became stale Snooki want smushsmush  sweet dreams...IMA SUHVIVAH! and now I cant even be bothered. Im curious to see what changes are being made this season but Im scared that Drag Race is a big fish in a small pond. Its not big enough to go into the ocean but now the pond is starting to run dry. To quote Michelle I need to see versatility from you LOGO TV! Thats all.,rupaulsdragrace,cna1l1g,8,t5_2t3or

2707304,0,t3_2r1o9u,Episode  UntuckedWhen Gia started to vogue Vivacious was cheering along going Oooh!! and smiling.  Gia then said Feeling like pussy feeling like cunt feeling like pussy feeling like cunt! And the scene suddenly cuts to Vivaciouss dead face with that shady metallic sound. Followed by Vivacious saying Child thats not cute!Episode  UntuckedTrinity was talking about her outfit how she wanted to show America what Trinity would give at home.  Bianca then cuts in and said The difference between you actually working at a bar and America is that America is actually there to watch it. Everyone started to laugh.  Cuts to Trinitys still face with the shady metallic sound.  Then Bianca said That was a joke there. And you can CLEARLY hear Trinitys loud laugh without seeing her face.  Then it cuts to the confessional with Trinity looking like shes pissed.Courtneys confessional  Joslyn is a sweet queen but... and Ughh...This is awkward! are two different scenes you can see the different hair.Episode Bianca and Trinitys Beyonce argument was obviously chopped up. When Bianca was saying You can paint to be Dionne Warwick... You can faintly hear Trinity speaking up but this was almost muted. Then Trinity suddenly said I have nothing to prove to you. And the argument escalated.Episode  UntuckedMilk asked what did everyone think about Vivacious. Theres like Ummms... and Darienne asked What about Vivacious? CRICKETS SOUND for another  seconds.Episode   The RusicalWhen Ru was going through the Werkroom and asked Joslyn where shes going to draw her inspiration for the butch queen from.  Joslyn said Bianca Del Rio! And then it cuts to Biancas face with that shady metallic sound.  When if Bianca really did hear that comment she would laugh her ass off.Adore Courtney and Darienne talking about American Idol in Episode  but you can see the conversation between Vivacious Bianca and Trinity about Beyonce that was shown on Episode  happening at the far back end of the room! And when Gia asked Whats a Tony?! April was beside her. Then when she later joined the American Idol conversation apparently April and all of her makeup tools are goneEpisode   Snatch GameDarienne  When it comes to Milk and her fashion...I dont get it! The full sentence was I know a lot of people are going to look at Milk and think I dont get it but I do because she reminds me of my friend Ambrosia Salad very colorful and very beautiful like Grace Towers or Glitz Glam.A user who went to Delas viewing party said that Dela told the audience that she never said about not being able to do an English accent.  Then theres Bens confessional voice only Ru does not seem into my idea. and then shows the shot where Ben is tearyeyed saying Im shaken my confidence is definitely shaken but I.... Which I think the context is actually when he was talking about losing his mother and his self confidence issues growing up.  Because he suddenly choked up talking about his mom.Episode  UntuckedWhen Dela was holding Trinitys picture in her hand Laganja asked Is she pretty? Dela said Yes!Courtney then asked Is it me? jokingly Dela said I said YES to the first question! And you can see Courtney smiling..Cue in the shady metallic sound then cuts to Courtneys somewhat pissed off face.Bianca to Trinity Let me ask you a very fair question what do you do successfully? Quickly. You can see Trinitys glass empty and she went silent. Cues in dramatic music. Trinity answers I hate that every time were in Untucked the conversations are about me... The glass is half full.,rupaulsdragrace,cnbt6et,24,t5_2t3or

Thats why we often have minority opinion threads.  Do you not remember how the mods even had to write threads reminding people not to downvote people just for supporting queens that they dont like?  Its especially strong when the seasons are airing.  This subreddit goes through cycles where theres a common lovehate for certain queens and usually comments disagreeing with that lovehate are downvoted to hell and back.  The only reason my comments and those of some others are getting upvoted here is because this is a positive thread about Adore and her fans are more likely to check this one.  On top of that just look at the topvoted comments...most of them are ones with direct or indirect shade towards Adore.,rupaulsdragrace,cnegcdg,2,t5_2t3or

2739475,0,t3_2rdjh1,Season  was the worst in a while for me.Season  kind of harkened in the new era of RPDR which included narratives specifically underdog narratives that made the audience root for people like never before.Season  which imo is the best season ever really worked because of the charactersJinkx Alaska Alyssa Detox. I would say those are four of the most loved queens ever by dedicated fans.Season ...not so much. The roles they tried to edit people into felt like just that edited. The underdog angle worked for Sharon and Jinkx but it did not have the same resonance with Adore who just seemed somewhat lazy and sloppy by comparison. Without a main villain there was again clear and present editing and splicing to try and make people fit the roles that had worked so well the previous seasons. Bianca was LEGIONS ahead of the other girls the whole season. There was never a time that I thought she wouldnt win. It was almost a cakewalk. We havent seen that since Season  and it still wasnt even really on the level of Season . There was almost a lack of competition. Frankly no one was on Biancas level as far as being a winner goes.Finally I didnt fall in love with anyone. In Season  I was full forces behind Sharon. In Season  Alaska pretty much changed my life and I also loved Alyssa and De. In Season  I didnt feel attached to anyone like that. Everything felt very rehearsed just like it was going through the motions.Season  was a huge letdown for me. Honestly I was forcing myself to watch episodes. I hope Season  is better.,rupaulsdragrace,cnfgt73,0,t5_2t3or

2813738,0,t1_cnnubvn,What I couldnt believe was that I think he was actually crying. Ive been agreeing with people on here so far that Perez has been playing it up in addition to being insane but I think hes actually just insane. Every single opportunity hes had to demonstrate some modicum of selfawareness has just whooshed past him. I feel like if youre going to play things up you have to be conscious of your behavior in order to change it. I think Katie who does seem to play things up for the camera has shown she has selfawareness particularly when Perez asked her about her children hearing about her being Britains most hated woman and when she was talking about her being so hateful but that she has a very tolerant and caring husband who still loves her. Even when Perez admitted to overthinking everything I think he was referring to just getting up in his feelings not trying to turn himself into something for the camera.TLDR I think Perez lacks the selfawareness to attempt selfediting and what weve seen so far is just how he is. ,rupaulsdragrace,cnnwxb1,2,t5_2t3or

Comments on youtube indicate people think shes bossy and a bully.This is strange considering the voters seem to vote out or want to vote out Perez and his associates. So we have two opposing viewpoints.Honestly Perez has made this whole season about him. Almost everything somehow comes back to Perez. People wanted Nadia and Alicia out. Why? Because they associate with Perez. People start hating Katie H and Michelle. Why? Because they took a stand against Perez and are very vocal about it esp. in Katies case. Ultimately it is all Perez.I cannot wait for Perez to get out so we can focus on the people themselves again rather than which side of the Katie H vs Perez battle theyre on.,rupaulsdragrace,co00syp,24,t5_2t3or

So yeah that bit of drama shes got herself into by befriending Perez is completely self inflicted. However yesterday was the only time we saw her behave like a fairly dare I say it normal housemate. She was integrating with everyone had wine and managed to have a conversation without tending to the manchild. She also gets along fairly well with the majority of the housemates and the only person who she has problems with is Katie H which seems largely one sided  I think Katie might like her more than she likes Cami.I couldnt help but notice she didnt even seem all that happy when he came back. It took her a long time before a smile even registered. Id like to hope that she gets past the dislike she brought in of Katie H prior to her entry and actually reflects on her one Perez free day and realises she needs to distance herself from him but then again this is CBB so its doubtful ,rupaulsdragrace,co2xqv5,6,t5_2t3or

In fact most people used prepainted skin or nude spanx. Violets one of if not the only girl who actually painted her body because she was the only fully naked one.Your mileage may vary on whether Violets look was sickening but I get why she won. I thought it took real balls no pun intended to stand on that stage completely buckass naked for so long. The only person I could have seen winning other than Violet would be Kennedy because her outfit was also fierce and very different.I think the issue was that everyone did at least pretty well so in order to win you had to do something that stood out.

I dont like her comedy but that can change the more I watch but so far so good...Fame  I was expecting an icy bitch like myself but she was softer than I expected. Her waist made me stop eating my kale salad and only breathe oxygen just like Violet. Love the looks but hate the whole my brand thing...girl its episode Violet  Sooo preseason she annoyed me but then that episode made me a stanandahalf! All the looks made my mouth drop! She is my Top  choice...bitches watch out!Pearl  Looks were great but girl this bored thing is getting ME tired. Great piece of eye candy! Hopefully as queens go she will take the time to step forward in personality.Kandy  To be honest the whole Kandy vs. Tempest thing seemed a bit edited. Perhaps there was an introduction in there but I dont think anyone would just ask someones age without even a fake hello. Her looks were not boring Michelle but there were other queens that were high and low that she might fade in the background a little bit. But girl is going to turn the lipsync out!Trixie  My love! Trixie is one of my faves clock the flair this is only a taste of whats to come...Cmon Top !Kasha  I love Kashas voice! She excites me and I usually dont like classic camp queens!Sasha  She needs to step her pussy up but cute trade...Max  I didnt get Max at first but the nude illusion runaway sold me! She is strong in a different way and the girls shouldnt sleep on her Miss Famehonorable mention Michelle girl no. Dont over do it with shade filled comments. Go back to the Michelle I love which is tough mom not negative and mean.,rupaulsdragrace,corkzjk,5,t5_2t3or

That you felt the need to jump to defense is interesting. Her whole point is that gay people shouldnt try to conform to any standard even selfimposed ones thats the first thing that she said. She just went in more depth on the straight part but by straights you can take that to mean mainstream culture. The problem isnt enjoying things from a culture. Its enjoying what you want but washing your hands of everything else that came with it.  This  is why a girl who wants to go to the gay club because its fun or take their gay bestie shopping can still be horribly homophobic. ,rupaulsdragrace,cowb598,1,t5_2t3or

3276708,0,t3_2xnlhm,Ben was not compared to Jinkx alot. Only HERE. At this point being a theater queen is not something that makes someone like Jinkx and a negative for fucks sakes. Even though one contributer here tried to make that a thing. Bianca was a theater queen long before she was a popular drag queen. And we dont even KNOW that Max has any aspirations to ACT in drag like Jinkx. He hasnt had that many roles or interviews about it that I can see at least. Self describing as metropunk and doing fashion art besides some theater? No not Jinkx LOL. Hes got chops that much is true. Ben was a certain NICHE and background producing shows and not being accountable for critiques and had the psychological baggage that held him back. There are always ELEMENTS that this show brings out and human frailties. Just look at Courtney and Adore. One left with GREAT confidence and the other was CRUSHED.

3288642,0,t3_2xt5ls, Logos new logo is very Lifetime like The best confessionals and we would probably could see the pattern are from Katya and Ginger. But also Kennedy. Her one liners are fucking hilarious! They are said in a very calm and collected manner. Girl please. No. Next. Although obviously she might not be referring to Sasha because Sashas name was not mentioned. The struggle is real. Bearded Ho is bitchy as fuck! My first time seeing a PR queen this aggressive and doesnt know how to sew. But props to her shaking her booty the house down during Geronimo. Miss Fames character portrayal  I know that people here dont like comparisons to previous queens but to illustrate my thoughts easier I think she is coming off as Courtney been there done that and Laganja newspaper stunt for attention and always talking about her brand which could get old real quick. I could be wrong so well have to wait and see. The maxi pad minichallenge I think was not a great idea since it was too long  we didnt really get to see the queens dedragging and interactions in the workroom. Rus walkthorugh was short as hell. The Bonus Scenes that were released on Violet and Katya is only about  minute long together. Cant they just insert that into the episode and not make it so obvious? Tempests Kelly Mantle treatment  Sadly when Tempest is in the Bottom  Im pretty sure shes going home right away. Since preseason research she has stated that lipsyncing and performing is not really her gig. Her departure was really sad.  I cant wait to see how the storylines will form and the tension between Violet and Michelle or if Max will stop his accent when out of drag. Jasmine is like a kid in a candy store which is funny from her excitment fangirling Kennedy and when she was describing her butterfly coming out of the cocoon story to Ru Violet and Pearls give no fucks attitude  people might be turned off by it but I found it rather funny especially Pearls monotone confessionals in Untucked  THE JOLLY GREEN GIANT Untucked censored...WTF?

3300489,0,t3_2xx3gf,Honestly there are some great queens out there. The typical Rhea mayhem etc list has become slightly mediocre no shade. A great suggestive cast would beQueen Bee ho  shes already rumored via Instagram to be auditioning. Not sure what are her comical strengths but this chick can definitely slay a dancing challenge and a lip sync. Evah Destruction  shes super unique shes great. She also made Vicky Voxs laughing track look really boring compared to hers. She is very versatile and she looks very polished. AJA  she can serve looks for days dance and is one funny bitch. She could give us the first ghetto girl in the top . Her style is extremely versatile. Anaol Fetale  shes a popular choice but I actually agree. She can bring a different look to the race not sure if shes funny but she looks sweet.Some things ive overheard. Thorgy isnt auditioning again after being rejected  times. Poor thing. Biblegirl is super fresh her aesthetic isnt that strong she seems cooky but her look seems to be controversial. Rhea looks a Lil butch. Maddelyn hatter does not look like someone they would cast to be honest. And Kim chis creativity could easily slay the whole thing however I dont think she is interested. But remember last year Pearl wasnt either apparently.I want new girls whos looks are put together are still funny and are actually human.,rupaulsdragrace,cp4hd8i,4,t5_2t3or

3302103,0,t1_cp4lbuo,It reminded me of Joslyn telling Courtney she had a whole closet of things! ...its like yes but we all know Courtneys stuff is... expensive? I guess it boils down to if youre not rich you better be good at making what you have look expensive. Im not huge on looking expensive mattering so much as neither charisma uniqueness nerve nor talent revolve around how tasteful your clothes are... but when the challenge is centered around look I ty to put that aside and be superficial otherwise its harder to enjoy. In the first episode the look is really more important than later on which is proving to be a huge disadvantage for talented queens who have put less focus on applying trends to their style. If I were a total nutter Id say that it serves as a chance to get rid of older queens before they get to the personality based challaneges... because itd be harder to eliminate them later and god forbid we endup solely based on merit and talent with a  year old who doesnt know what fleek means as the winner.

There could be an equal amount of drama and the producers would be happy if Pearl said to Ginger I get a vibe you dont care for me or something and the producers could have easily asked Pearl or any other queen to bring that up.I dunno man its like if you were at a job interview would you go in saying why you got fired from your last job? No. But if your interviewer asks you tell the god damn truth just twist it around at the end to your benefit.

I wont say that but I will say that Trixie seemed to have more passion to win the crown. Pearl needs to get her confidence and get some fire on her toes..

Everyone seems to be missing a letter from CUNT different people missing different letters but there isnt anyone yet who stands out as having the full package. Its tough to explain but look at Violet doing Adore in the Sissy That Walk video  Adore was C to the max in that video it was breathtaking and I was not feeling Adore for the majority of the season. Violet was...angrylooking?I didnt do all the research everyone did on the queens I like to come to the season fresh and see how people manage in the very particular hothouse that is Drag Race but Im starting to wish I had because theres a lot of this season that is leaving me baffled.

She was OK but not a standout in any way.Shakesqueer was probably her best performance and probably the only one Id say was good but nothing to rave about.  That episode was full of awful performances and thats the only reason hers came off as good as it did.Spoor was yet another where she faded into the background and was overshadowed.  Shes not excelling but shes not absolutely tanking.  Her looks have been meh did love the beard one though and shes just getting by because others are always a lot better and a lot worse.  Shes the definition of a floater to me.  I dont see her as being underrated in terms of performance but I do think shes unfairly getting screwed over in terms of screentime.  ,rupaulsdragrace,cpvi7i9,0,t5_2t3or

Yes shes had a bitch edit but you cant deny shes been the most consistent bitch this year. MKD gave the lypsync more flair in my opinion and its a shame she wont be there for snatch game! Violet will finally come out of the bitch edit and show she has a heart! Trust me its coming! JDF is just coasting hopefully we see something exciting soon Miss Fame hmmmmm Im still not sold.

First episode obviously nothing can be done but three episodes?  Four?Its been said before but the editing is looney tunes this season.  Maybe the judging is the same as its always been but theyre not showing the viewers HOW they came to these decisions like they used to.  We havent gotten any discussion of why the winners deserved their wins or any discussion of the high queens really.In previous seasons usually it seemed like past performance was taken into account by the judges or else they would show some discussion to help us understand WHY a queen who had been safehighwin had messed up so badly that they deserved to go home over someone who has been strugglingalready lipsynched.

She is obviously a great lipsyncher and has turned out some great looks and is performing well but its possible shes just not right for the show. This competition is as much about being good for reality tv as it is about talent. Its the nature of the game. It could be a conscientious decision by editing to paint her that way or shes just not giving them what they want to see. Even Kandy seemed to be realizing that in her comments in the last Untucked.

I dont think theres anything wrong with having a signature look and quite honestly the gray hairbeauty mark is pretty much the only thing about Maxs look that hasnt been extremely varied from week to week  all her outfits have been pretty distinct from each other stylistically. It seems like Michelles kind of reaching for something to critique Max on because shes been so consistently great other than a generic performance in the spoof video.

She does seem pretty good at imitations but Im just worried about her floundering with landing an improvised line. Shed be brilliant if shed just slow down and speak up and if she could push herself to the level of the Katyas and Gingers.That said I think shell take any direction she needs to win.

Shell walk a runway where shes barely able to breathe and smile at you while she does it and then not loosen her corset even once shes offstage.

Fame in this episodes runway kind of reminds me of Chad Michaels in that hes so polished he cant quite pull off looking off. My issue with Fame is less about the look and more about the execution because it was polished but I feel this was Fames moment to step out of Beyond This Planet Beautiful and try something else more gory. I mean she had a knife going through her head give me more gore.

Ginger Max Katya and Pearl have all been performing very well the last few weeks the whole cast slayed Glamazonian Airways besides Miss Fame Katya and Sasha who rightfully went home Max Pearl GingerKennedy and Jaidynn proved they could be funny from both a conceptual and performance aspect etc.. etc..Shakesqueer noone really impressed on either side because the script sucked.

Max didnt do well in the challenge and she didnt win the lip sync.  She didnt live up to what she has been bringing to the table for the most important episode of the season.It didnt come out of no where.  Max did bad with that Sharon Needles.

I think its easier to reach a worldwide audience if you use the internet. I cant really say anything about how famous Ru is in the US. Ive always assumed he wasnt Alist because most relevant not meant in a mean way or as a read I just cant think of a better word than relevant American celebrities are famous here as well.Ru has been around longer and has had much more time to build his brand and career. I dont expect Willam to be at the same level of fame in a much shorter period of time.

3948367,0,t3_35occh,As much as I want to say Pearl I am gonna have to say Kennedy! I feel like she not only wants the crown the most but needs it the most. She is trying her best and her talk with Ru really had me in tears. It would mean so much for her to win the crown because Drag is her passion so much that she dedicates YEARS of her life to it and also dedicates it to her handicap sister. I feel like she would really represent what a Queen is and she has shown versatality throughout the competition and has done well in challenge that was not her best subject. She works very hard and is a fierce Queen and I feel like she deserves it the most out of all  Queens left. As for vanity reasons I would love to say I want Violet or Pearl to win cause they are fishy and talented and I adore them but as far as this season goes I feel like Kennedy grew on me and like I said last week my top  is Pearl Violet and Kennedy if spoiler went home and now that spoiler is true then yeah Kennedy is my to  choice and I want her to win.  I am sorry for Ginger I have no hate against any Queen but her attitude has made me not want to cheer for her and for Violet and Pearl I feel will be very very successful without the crown and I am shockingly really hoping Kennedy can pull it through and make it. Kennedy is the underdog of Reddit and social media and she is talented but everyone is unfairly hating on her and I have soft spots for underdogs. ,rupaulsdragrace,cr6cjex,3,t5_2t3or

Its so unique and so subtle and she has such an attention to detail. I really live for this. I know a lot of people are gonna look at this and think Im just saying it because blah blah Pearl is hot but shes one of the few queens that actually uses the instrumentals as part of the performance. As someone who makes like... alternative electronic music thats what Im doing with my life what Im going to school for etc I can totally appreciate something like this because you can see she really looked at the instrumentals and is aware of the finer details of the song. Its just a very clever take on drag and I really identify with her persona on stage. Shes shown tremendous growth.

4013655,0,t3_36g0aj,I am gonna say this I love Pearl and she is my favoritebutI will be honest I am gonna be honest and say that I feel and firmly believe  that she should be crowned season  winner of RPDR. I felt  such an emotional connection to her and her struggle passion and story tonight. As a victim of sexual assault and verbal and physical abuse myself growing up and it happening to me at such a young age I completely cried so much during Pearls speech at the end. This happens to children and teenagers like us tragically too much and needs to end and we do not deserve it at all and I am still crying right now.spoiler I have also been struggling so much my whole life and went through a very bad childhood and teenage years just like Pearl have. Pearl has not had an easy life at all and like she sad she looks tired because she IS. Pearl is a fighter who went through things no child should and I have been there and went through things just like she have and to see her not be so bitter broken and angry is a miracle. She is a chill person who tried to not let things affect and hurt her because she has been hurt and taken advantage of in the worse way all her life. She has to constantly live with that trauma the rest of her life yet she manages to move forward and work hard for her dream and her career. She has reinvented drag in her hometown and is highly respected and made a name for herself and I am so proud. I feel even more sick at the fact that people keep bringing up how hot Pearl is as a guy and how that is why Pearl is here which is not only wrong but is pretty fucked up and hurtful because obviously Pearls physical appearance gained unwanted attention at even a young age and I hurt so much for Pearl and what she and I both went through that no one deserves especially a child. She is a fighter she is gorgeous inside and out she is talent and unique and funny and most of all she is a passionate Queen and she has so much to offer the world and me and many many many Pearl fans are gonna support her and vote our ass off for Pearl.

They were being way too sensitive at that point rolling their eyes and talking about being thrown under the bus ten times. Actually Violet managed to bounce back well with that whole artists shouldnt compete thing made it look like a principles thing and then she had that moment with Kennedy and whatnot. Ok.Anyway Kennedys right Ginger was silly trying to make up with Pearl or whatever. Its your opinion own up to it if she doesnt like it its her problem.

FameampKandy and JasmineampKennedy maybe even VioletampMax all looked reasonably similar. TrixieampPearl and KatyaampMKD all looked noticeably different and those two groups did the best.She danced pretty well in Glamazon Airways so I dont think its rhythm. I honestly think she was just defeated in the lip sync she probably couldve sent Fame home but definitely not Jaidynn.The only distinctly vulgar one was Eggs and Im sure that was only there so Fame Violet and Pearl could all be in the bottom.

It was interesting to watch the placement chart take form this season but overall this season didnt really sing for me and Im not quite sure why. Maybe its because a lot of the decisions felt arbitrarily decided by story producers rather than being based on the queens actual merits? I dunno. Some of the wins were definitely justified by the editing and the presentation but some of them most definitely werent. Eliminations felt very hit and miss as well with some queens going home for seemingly tiny mistakes when other queens skated by on mediocrity and hiding in the background.Overall Id give the season a .

Personally I dont think Vicky ever liked Willam but acted the part of fake friend for the sake of Detox the group and the helpfavors Willam would give her. When cracks started to form in Des and Willams friendship Vicky kind of went in for the kill and soon according to the redheaded back up singers Willam was nothing but a selfish impossible to work with cunt instead of the professional businessminded organized CEO queen he actually is.  Willam definitely can have issues playing well with others especially when he has an established plan and vision of his own but he is all about increasing the bottom line for all involved in any project.  Detox and Vicky didnt get that and couldnt put petty bullshit aside for the career and financial good of them all.,rupaulsdragrace,crw0pke,2,t5_2t3or

Such as the US Census....Hispanic being a linguistic origin although I live in Canada.  Obviously Kenya Michaels April Carrion and Yara Sofia are not really the same race.... despite all being Hispanic.  The demographics of Puerto Rico on wikipedia say like  of people are white   He then said I was a whitewashing racist colonizer etc.So its not just white trash.  I also saw a fight between two people who were IranianPersian where one said he was white and the other was FURIOUS because they were brown.  The one saying he was white was born and raised in Iran.... the furious one who wanted to be brown was born and raised in Canada.  But I think his beef was that in his mind white  EVIL destroyers of all and the root all all problems.  So calling someone white was an insult and I think some other people in the world have a similar idea.

At the same time none of us knows the actual story if there is an actual story and its not just cancelling some gigs. Maybe Pearl did do something to warrant all this rage from all these queens maybe she didnt and there is a bitterness to the critiques.The thing about Raja is that she seems a very emotional person. She doesnt curate herself as much as she should and says stuff that we would probably all feel in her situation but wouldnt say because its just not smart to do so.I remember watching some Raja Drawja and being very surprised about how Raja was being so open about not knowing what to do with herself in order to really tap into the big fanbase than she has other than doing some videos for WoW. I remember thinking this is the kind of thing you dont tell your fans.. Not because they will drag you but because broadcasting this kind of personal feelings about your professional or personal problems is just not business savy. Notice how we really dont know how Willam feels about her husband or how her acting carreer is pretty much over outside of Hurricane Bianca is affecting her even if hes making way more money than he ever has.Ultimately I dont think Raja was trying to tear down Pearl to build up her own career I think she just had something on her mind said it and then remember that maybe she shouldnt really share all of her thoughts and opinions on other queens publicly and just deleted the post.,rupaulsdragrace,csy2r5e,4,t5_2t3or

I spend far too much time making Katya inspired artwork and was one of the winners of her poetry competition. But even I can see that some people are out of control.Its a great shame that despite Katyas YouTube and social media content being among the most original and creative weve ever seen from a Drag Race queen a vast majority of the feedback she receives are people simply saying MOM or spluttering unnecessary obscenity. It must be hard to keep track of genuinely worthwhile feedback and fan interaction.Her latest periscope was ridiculous  people just asking her to penetrate their anuses and other such vulgarity. Its a shame because the broadcast was too full for several people to get on and try to ask interesting questions. Im not surprised she signed off by saying it was getting boring.She deals with it in such an admirable way  Im sure a lot of people would have snapped a long time ago. I just hope it doesnt put her off doing what she does.,rupaulsdragrace,ct0wqhe,24,t5_2t3or

Like if you have issues why is it suddenly Katyas responsibility to deal with them.A good quote that could be applied here thats why I am the artist and you are the public. Although thats a Lady Gaga quote I think because drag is more of a niche than we think its therefore a lot easier to contact the queens how easy it is to interact with them on Instagram for example furthermore half of them have their personal emails on their social media pages and people forget that there is a boundary and constantly try and break it.

Then one failure and BOOM she was gone even though she had the most challenge wins up to that point. It was frustrating. I want them both back.,rupaulsdragrace,ctck9h0,7,t5_2t3or

4625804,0,t1_ct65hfi,No problem!Cherri is honestly one of my favorite people. Ive seen her be so helpful and wonderful to girls who are just starting out simply because she sees talent in them. she has a very dry sense of humor and can be very... flazeda about many things. her who cares views can be really funny and charming though. most times she comes off as not giving a fuck when its probably just covering up the fact that she has a heart of gold. I also love that she is so accepting of different types of drag  shes like the opposite of Gia Gunn. she loves sloppy queens manly queens cheap queens bearded queens etc. she values talent and creativity over pageantry.her general show looks think rpdr nights can be on the simpler end. i mean those of us who are performing multiple times a week on top of jobs cant always put  into every look all the time.  sometimes we want to throw on offthe rack clothes and go. but when she puts the work into a look its always AMAZING. her looks that lean more horror and fantasy are just... insane. I dont know how else to describe it.overall Cherri is a great person and a fierce queen.  she has a wonderful sense of humor. my only concern is that she can be very selfdefeatist at times. when the odds start to stack against her or things get way too hard she tends to break herself down and give up. shes wanted this so bad for so long that I hope she fights for her life and doesnt let the stress bring her down. bc if she fights shell be one to beat.  ,rupaulsdragrace,ctdnlqx,2,t5_2t3or

Michelle will chastise contestants for not bringing enough drag persona to the challenges.  Santino Billy B Carson Ross ? will happily eat the queens pies and remind us all that Pie is a doubleentendre. Well learn that the metal grating noise is actually RuPauls recorded reaction to the producers ideas.  Not to be outdone by last years impressive  wins in  challenges each challenge will have three winners and four lip syncers.

Fishy queens are still exaggerating or even especially exaggerating what is feminine. What fishy queen isnt exaggerated? Youre wearing lashes contour heels nails etc youre exaggerating femininity. Many women also do this  but theyre also exaggerating their own femininity. If we want to strip it all back then thats drag too in the fifty shades of drag. Lots of different kinds of drag exist but esp in the context of this show we are looking for high drag which means its more than putting on lip stick and a pair of heels its an art form with a long tradition.,rupaulsdragrace,cu3v42c,3,t5_2t3or

Roxxxy is one of the fiercest and versatile competitors especially considering shes a pageant girl that has ever been on the show. and Alaska is most likely going to win. i mean who wouldve thought that All Stars  would be half from season five anyways?if filming started on the th th is a Friday then in that period without any double elim they could have eliminated Coco Alyssa Ginger and Katya. that leaves us two queens short with Adore and Phi Phi. and thats not even assuming that they stuck with teams for earlier episodes and then separated them if they did teams again then it can be explained.they have more time than they need for filming anyways. it would take  days to get to the top three assuming every episode is only two days  if you want to think that theyre three days. between this week and next week we would start to see the top four if the girls are allowed to return to media.its all just very.....suspicious. the absence of Alaska and the rest of Rolaskatox on social media is damning to say the least.,rupaulsdragrace,cuggiqh,4,t5_2t3or

Part of the reason why we dont get to see a lot of some queens is because there are too many of them to showcase before they start to get whittled down.Also production would never allow for a challenge where they couldnt decisively control the outcome.,rupaulsdragrace,cutr1lp,9,t5_2t3or

CUNT CUNT CUNT.Like some of them dont even look human anymore and I live for it. For example Shannels combination of intense eyebrowsmakeup grey eyes huge hair and over the top costumes makes me GAG every time. Also Pearls sleepy eyes Detoxs dont fuck with me youll get every STD look Ravens mug Ninas edginess etc.The look however has to match the personality because if you are not what your drag persona looks like theres some clash.

Her only major thing that stood out to me about her was that she was sort of unique I guess. The only people who I saw as major standouts to me were Ginger Katya Violet and Kennedy. But even out of that group none of them are in my personal favorites. I have found that there wasnt anyone on that season who I absolutely obsessed over like I did with queens like Raven or Jujubee or Sharon on their seasons. There were some select very talented queens on s of course and I admire what they do but none of them stood out enough for me as favorites amongst previous contestants. ,rupaulsdragrace,cvu4umf,7,t5_2t3or

People are allowed to not like her ya know? For the most part I dont tend to see any really vicious hate towards her like we saw with Jasmine and Kennedy. Its mostly just people griping that they dont like how her look doesnt change often which it really doesnt. Max has plenty of fans the kickstarter for her live show is  funded after just two days. Id still call her a fan favorite because its really the support of her fans thats keeping her going right now. ,rupaulsdragrace,cwj7c76,3,t5_2t3or

Most Irish gay people either live in those  cities or have emigrated Dublin has more gay people per head than San Francisco. The Irish gay scene is small and probably getting smaller. A lot of young people have moved abroad. Plus most younger gay guys prefer to gay friendly clubs. Where everyone is so liberal that they dont care who like. The music and venues are generally far better than gay clubThe main drag shows are in the George on Thursday and pantibar on Saturdays. ,rupaulsdragrace,cwl36uc,3,t5_2t3or

Theyre just managing these queens while the bucks are still hot for a couple years longer before everyone in the target demo forgets who their clients are. Its nothing against the queens its just the state of the pop culture world.  of RPDRs audience is straight teenage girls. Straight teenage girls will pay lots of money for mediocre goods. However this same demographic has a very short attention span. Case in point A year ago people on this sub and people in this demo were LIVING for Ben Dela Creme. She was front page news for months. I havent heard aboutfrom her since Michelle sorta took her moment from her when she crowned Katya at the reunion. People have moved on its just the state of the world. PE will move on to another niche when RPDR is done and dusted.

If the guys reduced the quality of the show and its noticeable in here at Reddit they will be read to filth. But the show as it is right now looks like a ready made pilot for the Food Network to pick up. It looks well done well edited just like what we expect from a cooking show on TV.

They also try to bunch together a group of personalities where some will clash and others will bond. Of course it cant be  predicted but they will try to steer the competition from the start to make some appear more favourable to the public and others less the villain edit. So even if there might not exactly be one winner decided from the start they definitely have an idea of wholl they want to win and try to give that person all the necessary TVmoments.

6025649,0,t1_cy9fhgt,Well I didnt want to get TOO into it... but this subreddit didnt even exist when S aired and I would argue that the superfandom didnt crystallize until S and the live finalerise of Needles.ampnbspI think the coolfactor of the AprilKandy connection is how unexpected it was to the layviewer. SaharaManila as well as NeedlesAlaska made their relationships known so they dont feel like easter eggs. But April amp Kandy were relatively unknown Puerto Rican queens that didnt talk about their connection outside of the show. So it seems really cool when you first realize it.ampnbspSimilarly I think Milan on UKS seems easter eggy because shes not one of the popular IMDB queens that youd expect to pop up on a program let alone on a trendy Netflix original.

I remember that during the talkshow episode of S Darienne was floored that they completely cut out a whole runway segment in which the queens  dressed like animals for the theme  had to first walk the runway with LIVE ANIMALS that had been brought in. She said it was a huge pain in the ass and a fucking disaster and took a while to shoot. Which is why she was shocked they didnt show any of it.With Katya I was at the crowd at Jacques for her elimination episode and she was super anxious the whole time because she knew what was coming but not how it was going to play out on TV.

But then again theres plenty of comedians who have basically done the same thing their whole careers so maybe Im being too picky. And obviously shes gonna have a lifetime career in clubs touring and hosting because thats always gonna work for her  to be honest I think she works better interacting than she does doing standup.

Like you said we all have different opinions BUT not many people are willing to change them. I just dont like it when someone has an opinion others disagree and then they just continue trying to discuss which in turn is just ARGUING. Its fucking annoying. Im all for letting others have their opinions even if theyre wrong to me. Because I just genuinely dont care about what they think.

6660452,0,t1_d083n8a,Im not projecting onto Dr. Luke my feelings about men. I dont have generalizations about men. I try to avoid generalizations in general.HOWEVER if we dont take Keshas accusations seriously it gives everyone the basis of questioning anyone who is a rape victim. You made the generalization that women as a whole think they can accuse innocent people of rape and get away with it. Thats a tiny fucking percentage of women who do that. But because a couple have does that mean we are supposed to assume every rape victim is lying? No but that mindset is exactly what so many people do and its dangerous to anyone who may be or has been attacked and is afraid of speaking up for themselves. It is vile to accuse anyone man or woman of lying about being raped. The amount of people who are telling the truth is way way higher than those who arent. You obviously have hang ups about women if youre gonna say that women lie and think they can get away with stuff. You realize ANYONE is capable of being disgusting like that just as ANYONE can be raped.  Obviously men dont come forward about being raped as often.What it boils down to is that you belittling someones cry for help whether true or untrue is incredibly disgusting and vile. Your mindset is the same as people who also claim a womans body can prevent itself from getting pregnant if raped. Seriously it is not okay to just say shes lying. ,rupaulsdragrace,d088xsr,3,t5_2t3or

6723289,1,t3_47po71,Its misogynistic to keep quiet and not speak out against an alleged rape that may or may not have happened? At the moment this is nothing more than a case of he saidshe said because Kesha hasnt provided any evidence to support her allegations which means the accused must reasonably be given the benefit of the doubt because we live in a society where one is rightfully innocent until proven guilty. I wonder how Bob would react if I accused him of rape right now? I have no proof but if he believes that a testimony from the victim is all that is necessary then I guess we should consider him a guilty rapist if were going by his logic. Sony has invested M into Keshas career so a multialbum contract is not going to be nullified based on allegations that Kesha refuses to support with sufficient evidence. Sony have offered her the chance to work without Dr Luke and the already stated fact that theyve invested around M into her career shows that theyre most likely not going to lessen the endorsement of one of the biggest pop stars and cash cows in the world. This FreeKesha movement is extremely unfair and unjust towards Sony and Dr Luke from a purely objective point of view at this point in time. This is why the concept of innocent until proven guilty is important. It protects possibly innocent men from being smeared and branded as a criminals. I dont know if Dr Luke is innocent or guilty. Neither does Bob or anyone else not directly involved. But its unfair to label him as guilty without any real evidence. My excitement for Bob has died down a lot since he started posting his opinions on social issues. Not only does it alienate fans who hold different beliefs to him Im not routing for someone who wrongly generalizes me as a misogynistic oppressor but its incredibly irresponsible. He has a fanbase now. He needs to realize that its not responsible for him to give misguided views on something he clearly doesnt know about.

6733405,0,t3_47sk01,Relevance amongst fans has nothing to do with where a queen placed on the show but how they market themselves after the fact. No matter when they were eliminated someone can easily go on to be a fan favourite after their season if they properly engage with fans on social media and release easily accessible and interesting content like music youtube videos things like Biancas stand up or Jinkxs documentary or even just touring a lotshipping helps with popularity as well but thats a whole other post. In the case of Sharon and Chad Sharon has released two albums now and Chad produces and performs with The Dreamgirls which besides some youtube videos is pretty inaccessible to fans outside of the LA area. Sharon still has ties with Alaska who is more talked about than Morgan McMichaels who Chad is most commonly linked to who also mostly performs in LAas far as Im aware. So if titles were reversed I think its unlikely Chad would be more respected or revered than Sharon and Sharon would AT LEAST be on the same level of prominence as someone like Adore.,rupaulsdragrace,d0fsjxf,2,t5_2t3or

Category is...   Theres something great in the premise of these lyricdriven songs but it just needs so many edits. Sounds like the lyrics were recorded during a Whats the T episode.. Legends   Really nice beat and remains interesting through the whole listen.. Feel Like a Woman   yup.. Drop   I enjoyed this one I suppose.. Drag Queen Honey   I didnt care much for the lyrics but I suppose its fun.. Be Someone   yasssssss Taylor Dayne! Its listenable. The more I sit through this album the more generous my rating is.. How I Wanna Hold U   Its not bad but its also not not bad. I could imagine hearing it on a bad downtempo playlist on Spotify.. High Fashion Labels   Lucian what did Ru do to you?. Sister Brother   Christmas album lyrics sampled and given to someone who has an ok voice with a terrible microphonemixer. Other than that its pretty good.. Nothing Nice   the most successful of the lyricdriven tracks. Still not so great.This album was really disappointing. I really love Rus music and was hoping for something more than this.

6801461,0,t3_48u1j7,I was discussing this the other day arguing that with some Queens the drag race format doesnt allow them to show their full potential which can turn others off them. Like I dont think this will be the case at all with Bob because he will definitely bring it to acting comedy and lip sync challenges. But that being said he will never be able to do something like his Slave  U or I Have A Dream number on the show. While Im sure it wont make much of a difference to Bobs ability in the race he wont be able to show some of his best work on the show. While obviously this doesnt necessarily lead to failure Alaska couldnt get pissed on but it didnt hurt her I think it leads to an idea of what a queen should be and when their act doesnt necessarily fit the drag race mould then theyre seen as too out there or just untalented.Not saying this applies to OP. Humour is subjective and you just might not like Bob in the same way I dont get Bianca. But was just discussing this the other day specifically in relation to Bob.,rupaulsdragrace,d0n8lic,2,t5_2t3or

6843073,0,t1_d0ryons,Although I agree Violet would probably not have won a season other than Season  her main competitors Katya Ginger and Kennedy fell short. I absolutely adore Katya but her selfconfidence issues really got to her. At first it made her quite relatable but when it got to a stage where she wanted to cover her Hello Kitty couture with an umbrella ... Girrllll that made me feel uncomfortable. To be Americas Next Drag Superstar you need to be selfassured even Jinkx was confident in her own talents and abilities to pull through the competition. Violet easily projects the impression of someone who is selfreliant and confident she is somebody who can represent herself and the Drag community.Kennedy and Ginger had more HIGHs than Violet but they both fell into the Bottom  twice and in RPDR that is the antithesis of a Win. Additionally their drag styles were not something new or something which could challenge the conventions of drag. They both were super polished but I think RuPaul wants to see someone who can expand the frontiers from Season  onwards Raja androgyny Sharon punk rock Jinkx campy theatrical and Bianca comedy. Violet is someone who takes fashion risks and who is trying to bring drag into fashion for RuPaul this is someone who can effectively put her title to good use. Additionally Kennedy and Gingers lack of open mindedness to newer styles was quite obnoxious dont give me the editing blame new Untucked is as born naked as the truth.,rupaulsdragrace,d0ryuoh,1,t5_2t3or

I see this edit as a build up to her inevitable Ive learned to love myself moment. She has everything in place to make us cry by the end of the season especially when shell get the inevitable call from her mother that will say she always knew and that hell always be her son and no matter what shell always love him for who he is.Or maybe Im too much of a Kim Chi stan. ,rupaulsdragrace,d11ymii,8,t5_2t3or

7022114,0,t3_4bpzr3,So I have a little story about Ms Turner. So during season  I met a really good friend of mine online who is a seattlite and she would and still does go to showsviewing parties and give me a run down of how they were etc. So she ended up going to see Robbie a lot and they eventually became really good friends and me and Robbie began interacting online. So for my birthday she gathered up all the drag queen signatures and flyers she could and she got Robbie to write a post card for me and he went to town wrote a whole paragraph about how when he comes to London he wants me to show him around. So I eventually scheduled a trip to Seattle and we set up a coffee date even though he was major busy rehearsing for the Robbie Turner Review. Before our coffee date I went to see one of his shows were by the bar and she literally come up behind me and grabbed me and instantly complimented by eyebrows. Then she started the show which was brilliant and she bear hugged me in the middle of it a common feature of a Robbie performance the rest of the night followed in this vein. Next day we had our coffee date and we literally were talking for hours about everything. She is just the sweetest. tldr Robbie Turner is hilarious and fantastic. I love her.,rupaulsdragrace,d1cb3fl,5,t5_2t3or

Imagine getting everyone to pick their parts and learn choreo as a huge group in episode two.

Harlem to me is the heart of NYC theres still community there are people who are living who dont have the nose stuck up in the air and arent zombified like most of the rest of NYC. What struck me is how people live it kind of feels like a small town frankly. Residents are not trying to make it big theyre just living their lives in an incredibly cramped gritty overdeveloped urbania. Not out of a sense of familiarity but a sense of place Harlem feels like home and I dont really like NYC but Harlem. . Harlem is something unique.There are parts of Seattle that feel like Harlem. . .the Fremont neighborhood for example West Seattle to some extent as another area the Central District and much of the International District they also have a similar sense. When I first moved to this region I couldnt help but go WHY?!. . .and it took me about a year of exploring granted fulltime graduate student  practicuminternship hours to learn that there is SO much creativity diversity and vibe going on in this cityscape yes even now with gentrification and outplacing going fullswing. . .combined with the easy access to greenwilderness. . .there is just as much going on here as there is in NYC that its consistently what I am NOT doing this week? rather than what do I want to do this week? ,rupaulsdragrace,d1hcbkl,2,t5_2t3or

Acid Betty trying to be nice in Untucked was strange and interesting to watch and I couldnt look away haha Acid and Kim are bringing some crazy allaround concepts to the runway this season Yall are still sleeping on Robbie but if shes not top  Ill be surprised. Thorgy is one of the strongest all around queens to ever be on the show. I will be shocked if she and Bob dont make top . WHY would they not spend more time on that runway?

7072623,0,t3_4cgus1,I agree to some extent but I think the type of lipsync a person should do depends almost entirely on the song. Latrice won Natural Woman because that is not a boisterous song its emotional and powerful but not energetic and she captured the song perfectly.  On the other hand something like Roar or Applause is loud and popy and not very deep. These songs in my opinion dont require a queen to mouth every single word perfectly. Whats more important is that the queen matches the tone and the energy level of the song. Certain songs are more suited to be brought to life through dance as opposed to through a lipsync performance.  I do agree however that recent lipsyncs have been underwhelming. For example Ive seen some of Lailas nonRPDR performances and she a sweetheart but I think shes too lowenergy considering the songs she likes to perform.  I dunno if Im making a coherent point but Ill say this I think certain songs require a more nuanced subtle lipsync and others call for a spectacle. I think it depends a lot on the songs meaningenergy leveltone.,rupaulsdragrace,d1i1mr2,14,t5_2t3or

She doesnt judge drag based on whether or not it is good drag she judges based on whether or not she personally likes it.We get it Michelle you hate the color green.  Maybe in your roll as a judge you could find a way to see past your own color preferences and judge the drag based on its own merit?  There is only so much leopard drag queens can wear.  I mean everybody likes what they like and in competitions you have to try to impress the judges based on what you think they will reward.

She took so long changing between numbers that the queen MCing kept having to stall and the show ran over. She did a wayyyy too long mix of every song in the top  right now no rhyme or reason so all the other queens had to work around that picking songs. The list goes on.

I ended my post saying I wish her success after the show which means she would need to change and be more approachable and open up to working with other Queens.

7171163,0,t1_d1slzsn,No worries and actually thanks for the wall of text and more than that a reasonable response that was nice to read. I can totally see where Americans come from with their history but let me speak from a nonUS perspective.Every country comes from that background Im AustralianBritish both countries have histories paralleling the US history so I get what youre saying. The thing Ive seen though is a heavily Amerocentric view of race race is an issue around the world but nationality is used more as an identifier. Language is a weird one POC is the word in fashion at the moment but thats an offensive term in most English speaking countries youre calling someone coloured people died to end that shit its abhorrent. But I understand its a language difference so I get it. The issue the rest of the world really has in my opinion with how America views race is it is essentially black vs white. If youre not POC and lets be honest they nitpick so much that they really only mean black dark skinned people because apparently fuck those light skinned black people then youre white. Americans call anyone from Europe white but a European doesnt see it that way. You cant say a Spaniard is the same as a German thats fucking ludicrous. So when a POC in the US refers to Europeans as all white we look at them like theyre fucking retarded because thats ignoring the major differences in culture between countries and even regions within a country northern Italians lok different to Southern for instance.I agree the nostril part of the song would seem weird for a white person to sing but maybe they interpret the rest of it differently or more to th epoint if they sing covers they sing whats popular and suits their voice.Anyway thanks for the great convo.,rupaulsdragrace,d1tal66,2,t5_2t3or

7187701,0,t1_d1v5n6j,Shes not refusing to do anything about her behavior. Thats your interpretation of it. Theres a difference between I dont care and Old habits die hard. I think thats a pretty important distinction to make and makes a world of difference. Once you know the context the situation changes pretty drastically.Go ahead and try to stop using the defense mechanism youve used for years. You might have the best of intentions but its just not going to happen overnight. Its tough. Its REALLY tough. Its rooted in a place of trauma you dont get over that without some hiccups over the way. She made mistakes she will still make them every now and then. It doesnt mean shes not willing to change. It means shes fucking human. For her to accept that others will treat her that way because of it doesnt mean she has to be happy about it. It also doesnt mean shell willingly admit it all the time. Saying shes an outcast because shes a freak isnt necessarily wrong either. Its quite possible that it plays a role as well.With the Chi Chi situation once again context changes everything. Knowing that she was having a good time with her and actually really liked Chi Chi it makes you wonder how serious she actually was when she told her she was a bad leader and would throw her under the bus. Was she joking? Considering how she seemed genuinely confused by Chi Chis reaction in Untucked Id say thats a fair assumption. Having a talking head of her saying shell throw her under the bus means nothing. She could have been recapping that situation as theyre often asked to do. She might have even been talking about someone else. Nobody knows whats left on the cutting floor.,rupaulsdragrace,d1v6hk2,1,t5_2t3or

7249562,0,t1_d226k9o,Because they wanted Ginger to win they made a season especially for her to win but she ended up being a biggot against the fashion queens she was so judgemental to the fashion gurls it was like watching protestants preaching. She should be the victim because she is fat flamboyant and not very handsome but she was the one judging people you cant crown a biggot.  While Ginger was making excuses for not sewing sorry but The Ball is as traditional as Snatch Game you cant complain you cant make one outfit you need to know it as you need to know how to impersonate and be funny or entertaining at least and not dancing Violet was working her ass off to do well passable in the excessive acting challenges and she wasnt giving excuses or saying acting is stupid like Ginger said sewing is stupid.    You have one queen working hard trying to overcome her weakness being quiet when people attack her style of drag and on the other hand one queen slaying in a competition suit made for her that makes excuses when things arent her cup of tea again the Ball started season  season  if you count the Diva Awards. The winner was pretty clear to me.    They had a bunch of nice actors but they chose to eliminated Max and Mrs. Kasha Davis.

It was their telling.Because so many people believe that she didnt even know her mother was ill which is absolutely ludicrous to me makes me question the edit.The producers wanted us to feel as sorry for her as possible and because no one is inclined to question someones heartfelt emotional confession added onto the story.Heres the bottom line. I dont believe for a second that Thorgy didnt know her mother was ill until the day she died. Thorgy didnt imply that at all so I was surprised at how many people believed something else.Im just very intrigued by this story as in my mind I would look to myself for blame. That is if I knew my mother was ill of course which is a crucial point that was left open to interpretation by the edit.,rupaulsdragrace,d265oim,-8,t5_2t3or

7377683,0,t1_d2grczy,They did an interview together where acid called sherry her drag mom and sherry called her baby and they know each other really well I think its an unconventional drag daughtermother relationship where sherry didnt teach acid how to do drag but was a major influence and friend who guided her once acid had started drag I think as acid said she didnt like the sudden oversaturation of drag queens in new york and the special treatment the rpdr girls recieved so was considering quitting drag. I think this may be why shes so critical of queens especially from drag race as drag race is meant to be the olympics of drag with the best of the best so she probably holds them at a high standard and when they dont match that standard she will most likely be annoyed. Shes spent years not being accepted for her drag and said that the past few boyfriends shes had just used her to get into clubs and the centre of new york drag I think shes done with being disrespected so now demands respect and is critical of anyone not putting in the effort which is probably why she was annoyed at chi chi in bitch perfect.

Ive never been in a community where everyone was alike. Just because there are gay people who disagree about marriage or word useage or agree on the tactics of one political group or another doesnt mean we dont have a community or that we have a bad community. We have to celebrate the differences in our own community and recognise that its ok that we dont all agree or have the same motivations. With that being said crazy fans be crazy.

She just lacked confidence on the show and i feel like she could pull a shangela and reqch top  even in another season. P. S.

7540291,0,t1_d2za7af,I dont disagree with what youre saying. And yes I know every one of us will always have different tastes and opinions. I can respect that. I didnt suggest Bob is the best queen ever but given the three options that we have I think hes the only one that can really bring an audience to life and appeal to the vast majority of drag show fans. I understand that some are fascinated by Naomi or Kim but really when has anybody gone out to see a drag show just because the queens looks good? Theres always that expectation of entertainment and traditionally its always been offered thru a high energy performance or through MCingcomedy  or both. But I cant recall ever going to see a show because of how a queen dresses or looks like. So what do we do with the other talented queens that arent performers? I agree that their talents should be recognized but are live performance and entertainment no longer paramount to being Americas Next Drag Superstar? Is it enough to be a fashion queen or a genius makeup artist? I guess thats where Im struggling with this new shift in the drag scene.,rupaulsdragrace,d2zam5z,3,t5_2t3or

I even hang out with them and I must say there are just amazing human beings. Did your opinion of anyone change because of this experience?Tyra Sanchez. I really loved her during her season It was indeed my favorite. During the Dragcon even thought her booth was empty she was always smiling. I pay to take a picture and she was so nice to me and even make a couple of jokes.Im just a curious fish wanting to know the T ocurrrr!It was crazy to see how some queens charged to take a picture with them. Some of them told you upfront before taking the picture but some of them told me while I was taking the actual picture.

I know we dont see everything and that their is a storyline I never denied that but HERES THE IMPORTANT BITthis is the order things happened  Laila rehearses with her group she struggles in the rehearsal as does Kim and possibly others so the choreography is made simple for them Laila does her performance on the main stage doesnt stand out looks sloppy and is mediocre Laila wears that fucking awful dress and wig and rightfully gets sent to the bottom  Laila lipsyncs and fucking bombs and is rightfully sent homeAFTER THE SEASON HAS FINISHED Editors look at the footage oh Laila goes home episode  better make her irrelevant because she has no storyline except perpetual mediocrity.I shockingly enough made my decision based on how she performed on stage with my own eyes not the editing.,rupaulsdragrace,d35ly4h,1,t5_2t3or

For Kims mother being told hes gay to her doesnt have as much weight I would presume because theres probably not a lot of evidence in her life to show that hes actually gay. However him showing her that he does drag outside of bringing home an actual boyfriend would be concrete proof that hes part of the gay lifestyle and thats why it would be much more difficult for her to be accepting of that,rupaulsdragrace,d392oe1,3,t5_2t3or

7628124,0,t1_d3991h4,gt Saying this does not make it so.MY saying it doesnt make it so.  Kim Chi saying it discussing her virginity explicitly does make it so.  I provided you with a video of her doing this.  Stop implying Im doing anything nefarious or misunderstanding the situation you lack information which I provided to you above.  I suggest you read it like I suggest you read the original post.  gt No one said the devils advocate cant be correctI and other people are telling you hes not.Youre implying it by noting it was devils advocate.  gt What matters at this job like any other job is your performance your confidenceskill your dedication and hard work and how people respond to you. ANDS is specifically selected to represent Rus brand.  Many of these factors come into what Ru looks for.  Ru is perfectly allowed to prefer a candidate who is out to all people and thus isnt held back by who she can or cannot be in front of different people.  gt you know what doesnt matter? What you do in your personal life or with your family.For any regular job listed above Id agree. For a celebrity? No thats hogwash. gt being a spokesperson for the job has absolutely nothing to do with whether youre out to your family about your work or your sexuality or anything and it fact it shouldnt. How can you represent drag if you cant represent yourself as a drag queen?  Even if its a subset of people that are close to her Ru is perfectly valid to prefer a queen who doesnt have this complication without being culturally insensitive.Look at the end of the day Drag is about rejecting societys expectations or mocking them and turning them back on the audience.  I agree that you can be a drag queen and still reject most of societys requirements of you.  For being a drag queen youre right.  Its completely consistent to represent yourself as one thing to some people and a drag queen to others youre a drag queen not a representation of drag itself.  But for being the American face of drag and all that embodies No. Thats not the same and it is a detriment to someones qualifications for the position if they are unable to face that last hurdle.  I understand that its hard to come out and I sympathize.  But its not cultural insensitivity to understand that her inability to come out conflicts with the very idea of drag. Not being able to come out reflects that Kim will compromise herself for societys expectations even if those expectations are narrowly expressed through her mother and thats not what Ru looks for in Americas Next Drag Superstar. ,rupaulsdragrace,d399ywt,1,t5_2t3or

Why does Kim Chi deserve extra leniency? And we all know what happens when a queen shows up at Drag Race and says she cant sew. These days thats a death warrant. Does not sewing make a drag queen less talented? No but this is the biggest platform any drag queen can get on these days so the expectations are much higher. I dont think its fair that Kim Chi fans are trying to downplay this and find justification for it. If were going to to make excuses for this type of thing well need to start making excuses for all the other queens weaknesses too. Kim Chi is not special. ,rupaulsdragrace,d3bd7dv,5,t5_2t3or

7656889,0,t1_d3c6cqu,I dont care if Im downvoted for saying this but I agree with most of what you have to say. I feel like the author is reaching trying to pin both racism and racial privilege where theyre pinning it. Hating Bob does not make you racist unless you hate him for his blackness and to imply otherwise is just ignorant.I do recognize that part of the reason Kennedy and Jasmine were hated was because they were blackI truly believe thatbut I think its also unfair to say it was purely racism motivating the hatred. They werent shown as acting very nice while they were on the show.I think Derrick made it further than she should have but I dont think it was white privilege. That was a stretch.I think the only parts of this article I agree with are about the Puerto Rican curse the Youre hot for a black guy thing and about No Fats No Fems No Asians.

Im not discrediting any of Bianca or Jinkxs achievements Im saying that in time I absolutely see Bob accomplishing many of his own. Theres a reason he works with people the likes of Bianca. Im sure Bob knows how to take notes that moment on the show was played up for drama. You cant take one moment from the show to make a point Bob and Lucian and ignore another Bob doing well in the New Wave Band. I said that Bob was not a greatclassically trained singerIm more talking about Bobs ability to put together a good song despite his mediocre voice like Alaska as evidenced by the pretty good Purse First.

Ive fantasized about making the drive to go to Parliament House for example for their White Party. Since I dont have any friends in the community this subreddit has been a crosssection where Ive experienced passion wit humor a spirit of perseverance in unjust times. Ive felt comfortable and accepted here just cheekily reacting to Drag Race moments and participating in banter. I often turn to drag entertainers when I feel depressed and seeing the pain and confusion among familiar faces hurts as if it was a loss within the family. Many of the slain are of the ethnicity as me and a majority of people in the local area. It feels more personal than I expected. Watching the news in TV the first thing I heard was that  people at the time were estimated as casualties in an Orlando nightclub. I thought that in itself was horrible but being told that it happened a gay club felt like a punch in the gut. ,rupaulsdragrace,d49l63m,2,t5_2t3or

Its things like him saying the word cunt or bitch innocently in the middle of a tutorial and then these girls gang up on him saying that hes misogynistic for saying the word cunt and bitch etc. I know Jeffree Star is no saint. But hes not the devil like these girls are saying. Jeffree Star is a messy bitch so its easy to believe when girls like that talk shit about him but theres a lot more to this drama.

Latrice is one of the most lovable people to ever come out of the show. Willam is fucking Willam and always brought life.

JS has clapped back with his own response video  where he provides receipts of said text interaction.

Even though she wasnt likable otherwise she knew how to put it on for the judges charm them and give good challenge performances. It would ruin the whole purpose of it being a competition to kick her off simply because people didnt like her when she legitimately performed the best.

Knowing the stereotypes of the angry black woman welfare queen etc. do you really think that a performer of color wouldnt get shit for it?For gods sake even Shangela the queen who has a humor closest to Katya who is of color had to struggle at first with the fans perception of her drag and her humor.

8544171,0,t3_4wp9wg,Heres the issue its fucking expensive to see a Drag Race queen. It costs several thousand dollars for a club to book a Drag Race queen and to make a profit tickets to see that queen are usually pretty expensive. If you pay a significant amount of money to see a queen and shes rude and over it you have the right to be upset.Queens leveraging their newfound fame to get booked for as many gigs as humanly possible is not mandatory. Yes its difficult and stressful but thats why theyre getting thousands of dollars for it.You cant claim you had a bad day at work keep the  booking fee and expect everyone to be loving and understanding because youre a real person.EDIT Bob is a great drag queen and yeah she does a ton of amazing charity stuff. That doesnt mean that she cant make poor business decisions like getting paid to do a meet and greet when youre tired and over it.

IMO it would have made more sense strategically to remove Roxxxy a tough competitor who won the previous challenge or Detox obviously a tough competitor than Tati Started strong but if she stayed would be shook by going from  to the bottom so quickly and would probably be off her game and go home around the midlate point anyway,rupaulsdragrace,d771bs0,1,t5_2t3or

Week  while what she did was hilarious it was not at all professional or witty like what theyre looking for.

Annie Oakley clearly never left the womb with a gun thats ridiculous   Helen of Troy was proficient in more than just electric guitar but recorded several best selling singles on the Theromin  Joan of Arc saved all the animals on the planet from the great flood but the song doesnt acknowledge that AT ALLThe entire challenge was about as historically accurate as a Family Guy episode so lets all take this with a pinch of salt.

Ive had experience of working with companies who are weighted towards LGBTI amp it genuinely creates a greater atmosphere of back biting bitching amp the like that we are seeing here. Of course not all LGBTI companies are like that amp it tends to be media companies who are. What Im trying to say is that sometimes they employ with a more positive weighting of the persons sexuality than their professionalism. This may entirely be due to a homophobic perception causing less straight people or allies to apply for a job in the company I dont know.,rupaulsdragrace,d7pqkos,10,t5_2t3or

8969227,0,t3_533jsn,Thanks for saying this. You can like something while still pointing out its faults. RuPaul purports herself to be a spiritual person so its hard to swallow that its just reality TV.  There are people who are doing art and there are people looking for a paycheck.  I think the whole Season  vs. Season  debate is the perfect example. Season  was full of drama edits and pomp and circumstance and people were not feeling it. It was dogged as the worst season. But Season  was pretty harmonious and about the art. People felt it was boring well maybe you just dont like drag that much. Drag is about artistry not about being a cunt. If you look at the Real Housewives theyre all one cancelled check away from bankruptcy or suicide. Ive watched Drag Race since Season  and it is one of my favorite shows. I just would hate for the series to become too contrived and overproduced in service of people who just want to watch people fight and cry on television. Thats not cool and thats in exact opposition to what Ru talks about. Drag is about color irreverence and laughing at things. ,rupaulsdragrace,d7pyr95,25,t5_2t3or

9090379,0,t1_d83ueb1,I agree.  Raven is an amazing queen but she was fucking hateful as hell to Tati and Nicole on her season and the way she treated Mimi was probably the worst act of bullying ever seen on the show.  Its also weird how people kiki the fuck over Shangelas sugar daddy breakdown when the scene broken down isQueen who was eliminated for being busted and almost a second time for wearing a dusty lampshade and a falling apart paper corset attempts to read another queen for ripped fishnets.  Also attempts to read the same queen for dressing camp in a Barbarella themed challenge.  Throws something at queen.  Attempts to get the whole room to turn on the queen and make her feel like shit.  Bullied queen attempts a compliment Shangela insults her some more.  Mimi finally responds after Shangela not leaving her alone and Shangela throws the mother of all tantrums.   Yet people live for the scene and go on about how much Mimi sucks. I know its been years and years since any of those seasons but Shangela and Raven were way bigger bullies then Roxxxy and Phi Phi ever were and unlike those two went after queens who werent popular or together enough to really defend themselves. ,rupaulsdragrace,d84im2e,7,t5_2t3or

However even though a garbage  talking trashcan is totally her I didnt think it was executed well enough and I did think Tati should have been safe over Detox.I also think Katya should have won the lipsync.

Rupaul doesnt deescalates the Phiphi stuff but even stirs the pot more and in this way looks like a bitch that has now her emmy and seems not to care anymore if someone gets bullied.  Cocco starts to hate against Roxxxy after her elimination even though the have been friends for years.   And now Alaska gets Phiphi like hate cause as i explained she is favorite and gets pushed and now did a bit of a biased elimination.

For instance I actually loved how she went into the standup comedy challenge. She knew it was not her forte and she couldnt possibly come out on top of that challenge but instead of panicking she just let her guard down and did her best even knowing she was inevitably going to hit some bump. I found it somewhat endearing and... mature of her?

Dont get me wrong I always found her insanely talented and very funny in some instances she just wasnt my cup of tea but I still respect her as the powerhouse that she is. Now Im definitely having a harder time liking her. I understand where shes coming from and I cant be mad because the bitch came to win but the way shes doing it and not being straight up about her motives comes off... poorly.Also I think shes getting so much hate because one the whole thing with her ex and two the producers are kind of shoving it down our throats at this point that she is the front runner and very likely winner. Thats not her fault and I think she could have honestly won just based off her own talent but it still just rubs me the wrong way.,rupaulsdragrace,d8al0l6,4,t5_2t3or

Its smallminded to tell people that the only thing they can do is blindly fall in line behind Clinton and the neoliberal imperialism she represents even if they live in a state where their vote isnt going to matter at all. We need alternatives to the Republicans and Democrats if were going to tackle the serious problems the world faces and people in solidly blue states supporting third parties and vocally criticizing the Democrats where they fall short are a small step in that direction. Third parties receive funding based on vote percentage and even if the two party grip on power is never challenged its the threat of electoral consequences and mass popular opposition that got us what reforms we do have.,rupaulsdragrace,d8gg295,1,t5_2t3or

9193116,0,t3_568jbd,Honestly I believe that Alaskas breakdown wasnt even about the competition. Alaska always mentions how she used her work as a drag queen to overcome her alcoholism. I think this competition was an extension of Alaskas self worth sober validation that she moved beyond a darker period in her life and to be on the bottom for the first time essentially almost felt like a loss of control. It truly felt like drag and by extension the competition became her life and to have the idea of a goal that she dedicated herself towards completely terrified her. When I watched Alaska break down I wasnt seeing a brat I was seeing someone in complete anguish. ,rupaulsdragrace,d8hamy0,25,t5_2t3or
9193160,0,t3_568u5d,Katya has become one of my favorite queens of all time and watching her anxiety spiral on her season was heartbreaking for me. I think she would bring an amazing spirit to the drag world! Shes versatile! She can be truly shadybut never come off bitter or cruel. She can be beautiful but also absurd. I want Alaska to win but I also think she has had a lot of success in drag. I also want Katya to win because she is something genuine and bright. I used to think Katya would never be able to be a winner because she seemed to get so frazzled and overwhelmed. But seeing her growth on this season... I really didnt think anyone would overcome Alaska as our new All Star but I think Katya has made a really good case for herself.,rupaulsdragrace,d8hau5v,15,t5_2t3or

Additionally the breakdown was over All Stars. Did the other queens get to this level of hysteria when they were faced with the possibility of elimination? Katya wasnt exactly disrespecting Alaska with that remark. She was calling back to Alaskas shade at the start of the show where shed called her Adore party is Adores catchphrase after all. It was establishing the dynamic that You cant expect me to save you just because youre having a tantrum.I dont think any of the queens are pure angels who can do no wrong except maybe Tammie but this wasnt being cunty at all just cutting.

Get the facts right the only way Katya could win is because they listen the fans for the first time ever and because Alaska fucked the surprise. Katya did great shes a fucking all star but the producers were malicious with her when they changed the whole season bottoms to make her look worse than Alaska. ,rupaulsdragrace,d8levrm,5,t5_2t3or

All of this shit about Trump being a horrible person is perpetuated by the mainstream media who is literally owned by Hillary Clinton. Anyone who does their own research can see this. Its a smear campaign and people who are uninformed are eating it up.Wikileaks just dropped the second batch of Podesta emails and there is a quote from Clinton in one of her paid speeches talking about how she supports DOMA and always has. People in this community should be looking very closely at this but all they want to do is talk about Trump bragging about pussy. Its fucking ridiculous.,rupaulsdragrace,d8mht04,1,t5_2t3or

9262360,0,t1_d8q26de,Thats exactly the problem with Lip Sync for Your Legacy. Some queens simply see themselves as fighting for the responsibility to send someone home strategically yet fairly rather than adding some wins to their repertoiresuckling piggy banks. Taking this ability headstrong as a strategy move leads to less likability in queens ex Alaska and withdrawing yourself from having to make that decision at the lip sync is simply selfdestructive in regards to winning the competition which is where I can see Detox snatching the crown  as shes been mostly neutral in this regard also due to lack of wins but still shes had a very concentrated consistency.Anyway in both instances of Katyas Roxxxy vendetta she would have had to make a particularly difficult decision to make. She even admitted herself on RuCall that she didnt want to send a friend home and toned it down on the lip sync because of it. I think that and her history with anxiety is proof enough she holds herself back. Shame it may cost her the crown but I just wish she went that extra nudge this season to fully prove herself. ,rupaulsdragrace,d8q2jwe,5,t5_2t3or

9303572,0,t1_d8vamqk,TLDR  Type in  for proper formattingActual replyFor the      like you were trying for you need three backslashes so it should look like this when you type it out     which will turn out like this The reason for this is that the underscore character this one   is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does this guy  .  Since the face of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the face this guy  .  The backslash is reddits escape character basically a character used to say that you dont want to use a special character in order to format but rather you just want it to display.  So your first  is just saying hey I dont want to italicize  so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since its just an escape character.  After this you still want the arm so you have to add two more backslashes two not one since backslash is an escape character so you need an escape character for your escape character to displayconfusing I know.  Anyways I guess thats my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lolCAUTION Probably very boring edit as to why you dont need to escape the second underscore read only if youre super bored or need to fall asleep.Edit The reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore which doesnt have an escape character doesnt have another underscore with which to italicize.  Reddits formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text then you put the text you want to format then you put the character again.  For example you would type italicize or italicize in order to get italicize.  Since we put an escape character we have italicize and dont need to escape the second underscore since theres not another nonescaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them.  So technically you could have written  but you dont need to since theres not a second nonescaped underscore.  You would need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line but not if you used a line break aka pressed enter twice.  If you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the nonescaped underscore to italicize.  To show you this you can type italicize and it should not be italicized.,rupaulsdragrace,d8vamvo,11,t5_2t3or

9429493,0,t3_59slfe,In no order. Adore Delano  probably my favourite so funny and naturally witty. Extremely talented. Made great TV. Principled and moral she calls bullshit when she sees it but manages to be diplomatic about it and stay loved. Really honest and genuine wears her heart on her sleeve. Smarter than she paints herself. I love her aesthetic personally and think shes gorgeous. Not afraid to go against the grain despite a million people telling her what she should be doing. Just seems like a really decent person still vulnerable and relatable.. Katya  THAT BRAIN. So incredibly smart the way her mind jumps from topic to topic reminds me of my ADDriddled self. Just hilarious twisted sense of humour the way she pokes fun at things is so clever manages to constantly keep surprising people politically astute using her platform to talk about issues that matter. Seeing her realise her star power and overcome her anxiety is really inspiring.. Alyssa Edwards A fucking treasure. Seems to be so wise and mature with the way she reacts to things. Arguably the shows most quotable queen. Everything that comes out of her mouth is solid gold and she doesnt even have to try its not contrived in any way its just who she is. Its been a real pleasure seeing her come into her own over the years and realise what makes her so special.. Alaska  Another smart fish. Her love for the show and fangirlisms make me so happy. The YouTube content shes produced has been so entertaining bitch knows how to market herself. Shes given us so many brilliant videos and is an insane crazy live performer. Probably the ultimate RuGirl and really adores drag as an art form. Speaks about feminism a lot which I like. Professional fish without being in any way conventional.. Bianca Del Rio  Almost perfect in every way. Just so fucking good at everything in her season it was sick. The way she took Adore and Trinity under her wing she clearly saw the talent and potential they had. Doesnt put up with any bullshit and is just seasoned great fish. Unparalleled ability to read a bitch shes so quick.Shoutout to Trixie Jinkx Latrice Sharon Laganja and Willam. I just have a lot of feelings.,rupaulsdragrace,d9b9405,3,t5_2t3or
9429612,0,t1_d9aodak,As Ive said before it was mostly Coco but Alyssa wasnt blameless. Coco asked if anyone thought Phi phi had changed keep in mind this was still episode  then called the people who raised their hands stupid said they were republicans while everyone else in the room was intelligent and laughed at them. At one point Alyssa tried to be fair saying that she thought Phi Phis snatch game was passable but the crowd then booed her and upon seeing the crowds reaction changed her mind Coco said it was terrible and should have gotten phi phi sent home. Alyssa at one point also straight up lied and said that phi phi was going around the room trying to throw people off and make them change their characters Which we know isnt what happened because Roxxxy backed up phi phis version of events and we can see in the episode that the three of them were sitting and talking together. Alyssa and Coco also both encouraged the crowd any time they were booing Phi Phi. Alyssa said very little that was explicit as compared to Coco though. Btw I am totally in agreement with you that phi phi shouldnt have lied about Alyssas critiques but that lie didnt attempt to discredit Alyssa it tried to discredit the show by alleging the critiques were edited to make Alyssa look better. Still not okay either way though.,rupaulsdragrace,d9b9nj8,1,t5_2t3or

I also asserted that it doesnt have to fit a certain aesthetic or era to be grunge and it doesnt. She can wear whatever the fuck she wants and it can be grunge. Its about the attitude and purpose which you described which is grunge. Again shes misguided about the cutoff point of the postNevermind era of grunge which is excusable as many in the s themselves were confused about it and only aware of it as that.

10156948,0,t1_dbvb0hl,Its possible but its often very difficult especially on large stages and outdoor stages. The sound that people on stage hear is often very different from what the audience hears  for example the natural reverb of the area might mess up the rhythm theres a weird delay between the audience audio and the stage audio in large venues and oftentimes you dont really hear all the instruments properly and its just a bunch of noise etc. etc. More importantly for musicians and especially singers its very hard to hear what youre doing so you dont know if youre off or what the hell it is youre doing. Theres a reason why some singers cover one of their ears when they sing  its not just this fancy gesture that they picked up from divas. Thats also why musicians on stage are usually each assigned their own speakers or monitors that reflect what they do andor a clearer mix of the overall audio. And the inear piece or headphone is usually the cleaner solution. ,rupaulsdragrace,dbvched,37,t5_2t3or

Like even in the workroom when theyre working on the dolls you see alaska creating the character and the result is basically Alaskas humor and dirtiness.

10344153,0,t1_dcfxhqf,gt where fishiness is considered a talentI really dont think fishiness can be considered a talent but more of an attribute. I agree that it does take talent for drag queens to make themselves look feminine but really a lot of the fishiness we see from the queens Im talking about RPDR queens specifically isnt just a result of working hard for years to perfect their makeup but it is also down to how naturally feminine their face already is. Like Courtney Act has a naturally feminine face so she barely has to work hard to look fishy so I wouldnt consider it a talent of hers but more of an attribute that adds to her talents as a drag queen overall.Its a similar situation with queens like Manila Tyra and Tatianna. Yes they are all great at beating their face but their fishiness is not purely down to their talent as makeup artists because they all already have quite naturally feminine faces as a foundation for them to work on. So with these girls again I wouldnt consider their fishiness a talent but more of an attribute or advantage that contributes to their talent and success as drag queens. I also dont think being fishy is a hugely determinant factor as to whether you win the show. It can help but you need the charisma uniqueness nerve and polished professionalism to back it up. Also dont think its accurate to think Kimora embodies all the dreams of a straight man because I know a lot of straight men who really do not want to go for someone who looks like a human blowup doll. ,rupaulsdragrace,dcgkgyc,1,t5_2t3or

10372623,1,t1_dcjl1vo,Sorry this board does not exist to pander to or massage the ego of any queen Pandora or otherwise. It exists to discuss the queens and their performances on andor off the show. If people dont like her they dont like her if she doesnt want to read about peoples opinions or if those opinions upset her then she shouldnt be reading them. It isnt compulsory for any queen to access this sub and its probably not sensible for them to do so particularly if they are of a disposition that will be upset by people not liking them.Some people do not like Pandora some people do not like her performance on AS some people find her general act grating. Some people do like Pandora some people enjoyed her performance on S some people find her act entertaining. And all those people should be welcome to discuss it good and bad because that is the point of this sub. The worst thing said about her on the thread linked below is that she came across as whiny and she had a defeatist attitude. If she cantt read that without getting upset then she shouldnt be browsing this sub.The suggestion that we should all post nothing but nice things just in case a queen pops on and gets upset is fucking annoying and seems to get trotted out all the time.,rupaulsdragrace,dcjsrtw,-6,t5_2t3or

10599858,0,t1_dd99rwl,Pretty much all of her instagram posts even before today have had hashtags relating to Rupauls Drag Race and Im pretty sure thats not allowed. Highly speculated queens are not allowed to mention or hashtag the show before the official ruveal. She did an instagram live today and was supposedly very negative and told people she wasnt on. I dont know where the video of the livestream is but this post mentions it. She also posted her own video on her YouTube channel today and again seemed very bitter about other queens in her area and also about S in general especially towards the end. Shes been very loose lipped about a lot of things Drag Race related before today and finds it fun to mess around like this. EDIT Holy shit I just found this video from Ru  months ago mentioned in the post I linked above and think it deserves sharing again. This could be clearly hinting about the behaviour of a S queen and Ill be gagged if its about Nina or even Kimora. ,rupaulsdragrace,dd9alfq,27,t5_2t3or

I get that she was frustrated because people kept bugging her about season  but mocking people who arent performers and are just trying to live their lives ... not cute.Should be interesting to see how she gets along with Peppermint.

10663776,0,t1_ddfrulv,Season  is always the one that leaves me scratching my head. Its so much less diverse than every other season I feel. Why put Max Pearl Violet and Fame all on the same season? For that matter Kasha Davis and Tempest older comedy queens and even Jasmine and Kennedy southern pageant fill similar niches to each other.

10666761,0,t1_ddg52ir,Moscow is the place to be if youre Russian gay. Or Saint Petersburg but I dont know much about it. In Moscow its like you can be gay around your educated circle of friends gotta be really cautious at a work place and dont you ever be gay around white trash. Theres a popular video where gays are holding hands and walking around the least homophobic neighborhoods of Moscow which I strongly believe to be the least homophobic place in Russia exUSSR countries and Eastern Europe and still have a lot of problems. I spend a lot of time in Moscow because of the Uni and can approve the video to be  true. The scariest thing though is the quantity of homophobes among medical students and doctors which makes no sense but surely is an existing issue. I had less problems being super gay in a gymnasium in my small city  km from Moscow than in Sechenova University. Its like professors can go on a rant about how they dont like gays even though no one has asked them. And if you go to a protest against homophobia and manage not to be beaten or arrested which is very hard in Putins Russia and your Unis administration will know about it you will have problems and may be suspended. And even though gay clubs are super lame here from time to time there would be aggression towards them. Like armed people can brake in and hurt people randomly or politics will raid them for no apparent reason even though its legal to be a gay club especially in St. Petersburg. And also since propaganda is illegal among children they may bring them along to a gay event to make it illegal especially Vitaliy Milonov an infamous governor from Petersburg. ,rupaulsdragrace,ddg71ll,9,t5_2t3or

10669052,0,t1_ddg8ywo,Specific points? Where do I even start? Lets just make a list of things that youve rattled off with no explanation or justification gt white clothing would not be considered racist because of the KKK because white clothing has a much wider history of use than just being used by the KKK. Blackface has specifically been used as a method of portraying racist stereotypes of black people.So this is about numbers? How much wider? At point does something go from being irrelevant to racist? Burning crosses seems to have one purposes where as wearing white has many. Theres a clear difference there. So are you saying that wearing brown makeup only has one purpose? Thats just demonstrably false.gt Thats how it is often still used today Where? By who? Certainly not here. gt racism in general is still very prevalent against POC particularly black peopleThis is a total non sequiter. If thats your reasoning then white good man should also be racist by that logic.gt Perhaps if there werent still such a hostile environment of racism in our societyThis makes sense to the hoods and to the blackface whether its accurate or not But you still havent demonstrated how they are different.

Remember when everyone was marking Miss Fame as season  winner? Kelly as top ? We have no idea how the queens will do with the challenges and how well their talent will translate on the show. The month between the ruveal and the premier is a scary fanfavorite circlejerk when emotion impatient gays use the downvote button as a dislike button.

Your need to demand proof to back it up suggests that theres some kind of problem with his choice in profession. If I was saying Miles is a fucking accountant would you be demanding that I back it up? Am I throwing shade? Yes because hes a piece of shit and he deserves it.

10780636,0,t3_5u2u26,imo Bob was only the clear winner for S because everyone else was critically weak at some aspect of drag. Some couldnt dance Kim Chi Dax etc didnt have social media star power personality Derrick Robbie etc or wasnt extremely good at one thing like Adore or Courtney or Sharon. None of them were slouches definitely but none of them had the extra oomph that separates the winner from the pack. If you put Willam or Latrice or someone similar in that group they wouldve eaten them up in three seconds. Bob is still great but her makeup is spotty she  hasnt served us anything truly ICONIC and I dont think she really showcased the full length of her talent for comedy or lip syncing. RuCos Empire was really when she began to steamroll for the win because that was when her CUNT was the most out and Thorgy still threatened to wreck her low I still say that the win only happened because Bobs group was two shades better than Thorgys.,rupaulsdragrace,ddry03t,1,t5_2t3or

10842868,0,t1_ddycr5o,True. I think Aja is cool but I dont know that her lipsyncs overall are elevated against the other queens in this instance or can be called a special skill.

10852104,0,t1_ddz958e,Ben sparingly used the DeLa voice though she used her natural voice in confessionals the werkroom on the mainstage and in untucked. The judges harped on her more for her costumes than her voice when it came to her hiding behind a character. Laganjas the one who put on the voice the whole time  people despised her for it.And Im pretty sure thats just Adores voice.I think people are sleeping on Jaymes because shes rarely out of character at least in her online content not because of the character itself. Some viewers dont like queens who put personas on and who dont just be themselves from time to time.People are jumping the gun though we dont know if shell go the route of Laganja or DeLa when it comes to her persona on the show and whether her character is used appropriately or if it permeates everything she does.

As much as Im a fan of the show Id like to RPDR to go out after  more seasons on a highnote rather than becoming like this zombie reincarnation of ANTM. I wouldnt actually expect too much to change budget wise on such an enstablished show. Many network shows are unpopular then end near the height of their popularityawards Parks amp Rec comes to mind. Itll be interesting to see if anything does chance... but VH has been in the mix since the S syndication.

She changed the performance and made it her own but the opening minute or so is a direct rip off of Evahs. To then claim that Evah copies others is just unfair because many Drag Race fans wont know Evah as they follow the show not drag and hence she is discredited in their mind. If Nina has receipts beyond other girls have said then fair but I dont see it.I see where shes coming from and I agree but dont discredit Evah especially when youre now on a larger platform and stage.

When you capture a look you usually think of the most recognizable parts of that look first and work your way into the details. For nina she captured the famous faceless silhouette the legginess of the outfit and the crown. Sure the lace wasnt red but gaga had her boobs almost out so she decided to be curvaceous and add some thick thighs and pads. ,rupaulsdragrace,dfdlpyw,9,t5_2t3or

She also lived for Sasha.gtT Shea said Charlies entrance quote was Mother Monster has arrived! but was cut. Which makes sense bc Charlie mocks Gaga on her YouTube often.This is NOT what Shea said. Shea said this was what Gaga said when she entered the workroom and she knew it was actually Gagaand not an impersonator because of the voice thats not a man Maury.

11321686,0,t3_61j5rl,Im so sad that people are being so mean and rude to her about her looks she doesnt deserve that at all! She seems like a strong one though so she can at least push through.However I dont buy that she didnt have time to touch up her makeup. And Im not talking about her skin texture or anything like that just the makeup quality itself. If everyone had time to change their makeup from the entrance looks into their runway looks some even being noticeably different from each other like Trinitys for example I wish she made the time to at least touch up. It was really noticeable that she didnt put any time into her makeup. Even Jaymes who seemed to get the harshest critiques had noticeably altered makeup between her different looks. I get Aja had to be sewn into her gaga look. But then why did her Statue of Liberty look reuse the entrance makeup prior to that?

Needing validation from people he had never met is his real problem. He needs to work on being happy with himself from the moment his eyes open til the moment they close at night. And his joke about being on Grindr date was probably true lolHe was always on there being defensive in his profile and acting like his shit dont drink and fuck the world.But wanna cry about being depressed.

Laila would have been a way better fit especially with the crop of girls they have she would have brought the goth aspect which non of them seem to have. I will be so over season  if I hear the words CuCu uttered more than  times. It was funny the first time and after that it was just annoying! I honestly hate saying this because Cynthia is a sweet funny person I just think she is way funnier when she isnt trying to be funny which she was doing thee entire time she was on the screen during season ...I hope she is herself and everything doesnt come acrossed as forces and trying to hard to steal the spotlight..I mean it is a competition and you want to steal the spotlight but there is a difference between acting a damn fool like Laganja than stealing the spot light in a good way like Bob or Sharon who just used their natural abilities to have the attention on them instead of the other girls.,rupaulsdragrace,dflfpj4,8,t5_2t3or

Every delusion has negative consequences for you and those around you. Maybe you believe in an afterlife. Suddenly this life doesnt mean as much to you does it? Maybe you believe that black people are fallen angels. That might not jive with most other people. Maybe you believe that praying to a candle will help you win a reality tv show. Gee that might give you lots of hope but its not going to actually help you win. You could have been practicing instead of praying to a candle. Poor example because she does actually win but not because of a candle. Just trying to tie this all in. Maybe you believe that god will heal your sick child and you dont take them to the hospital. They will die.Our beliefs have consequences. So if you actually give a shit like I do you dont just sit by and let people go on deluded. ,rupaulsdragrace,dfpu3n1,-5,t5_2t3or

11453338,0,t1_dftbcco,gt Theres a part of me thats really proud of Adore for suing PEG because lets be real there is a very exploitative element to how the queens are managed. Even though the show has such a strong following for the most part drag is still very much a niche subgenre of the entertainment industry and these girls have limited choices in terms of representationmanagement.I am surprised that Willam never set up a management agency for the queens. My understanding is that he used to manage a lot of the gogo boys in LA. Obviously managing drag stars who are getting thousands for bookings is different but still pretty similar. He seems like he would have the business acumen to do itWhat happened to Adore is shitty but likely preventable if she had a good lawyer from the start.

11599295,1,t3_65jmkg,No. Eureka needs to LET. PEOPLE. TALK. Period. She has a penchant for talking over people and that can be irritating. Sasha didnt finish her point because Eureka jumped on her feeling the need to get all defensive instead of apologizing for being rude which she was. And guess what? Whether a person struggles with Anorexia Bulimia or what have you or a person is overweight BOTH are instances of DISORDERED EATING. If youre too skinny and you dont eat or you throw up after eating thats a disorder. AND SO IS OVEREATING. Im sick of the SJW bull shit. Im not skinny nor am I a whale. But I am over a certain weight. I accept it and DEAL with it as best I can until such a time as Im up to really changing my situation.  If you accept yourself at a certain weight thats fine but dont sit there and ask other people to accept it knowing FULL WELL that in either case its NOT MEDICALLY HEALTHY and you have to deal with the consequences at some point.As far as the situation with Trinity goes  granted she sucked at time management but she DID take responsibility for it. For Eureka to say that she was dictatorial was bull shit. Trinity tried to put people in roles she thought they were suited for but if they had any objections they WERE allowed to voice their opinions. Whats wrong with asking people with obvious big egos to raise their hand before speaking and not have people talking over each other? Thats what a leader does to maintain some semblance of calm amongst those big egos. And in the end for all the shit Eureka talked she and Nina did their jobs. So imo Im quite over Miss Eureka.,rupaulsdragrace,dgasekc,2,t5_2t3or

If Huckleberry Finn was relevant e.g. in a film or a lecture or whatever then quoting the n word wouldnt actually be an issue imo I know shock horror. She quoted most of the poem its not like she just quoted that one line. Saying she shouldnt have quoted it is completely irrelevant she did it and like you said it wasnt the end of the world. Its just such a nonissue and sorry girl but the phrase cultural appropriation doesnt really mean much.

Youd miss the fact that even the most busted jank queen on the face of this earth can turn out a performance and move you or snatch your wig just as hard or better than any of the Drag Race girls. Youd miss a massive spectrum of queens that the show doesnt highlight from JoJo Baby to Christeene to David Hoyle to Boychild. Drag Race has been brilliant for flaring up mainstream recognition and love of the art form but its always been bubbling away merrily in nightlife all over the globe so hopefully people will be encouraged to seek out those spots and widen their horizon when it comes to gender bending art.,rupaulsdragrace,dgnnhs6,18,t5_2t3or

11718428,0,t1_dgo7fqu,Im gonna get downvotes for this just like you did but youre exactly right. The fairytales were all European in nature... Europe tends to be very white. Snow White had to be white its literally her distinguishing feature. Cinderella? This is a fairytale almost universal to all cultures but it drew heavily from the German Aschenputtel and the Italian Cindrillon. Aurora? Shes based off Charles Perraults La Belle et bois Dormant and The Brothers Grimm German adaptation Little Briar Rose. Alice in Wonderland? Alice is English. Peter Pan? Wendy John and Michael are once again English. The Black Cauldron was based off a book called the Chronicles of Prydain that wasnt published until the sixties but takes place in medieval England EDIT Ive since been corrected and reminded that it actually takes place in medieval Wales. Ariel? The Little Mermaid is Danish. Belle? Based on the French la Belle et la Bete. Jane from Tarzan? English. Rapunzel? Tangled is based off of the German fairytale Rapunzel. Merida is Scottish. Anna and Elsa are both from a seemingly Nordic land and based off of an amalgamation of  fairytales from that region namely Hans Christian Andersons Danish story The Snow Queen.        That leaves us with  Mulan as Chinese accurate race to her story.       Jasmine as Arabic though Aladdin is technically supposed to be Chinese if we follow  Nights. Esmeralda as a Roma Gypsy though according to Hugos novel her mother was biologically French.     Pocahontas as a Powhatan Native American her story is extremely twisted in the Disney version granted.   Megara as Greek. Edit I am not saying that the Greeks are People of Color. They are white. I put here because it was  in the morning and logic told me to put her here but aesthetics told me Id already used too many parenthesis and I couldnt explain why.     Yes Hercules is white but it is worth noting that this is one of the few instances where a white character is very overtly tied to the culture from which they came. In most Caucasian led movies the characters are from nondescript European countries and others influence from their country of origin. In the case of Hercules the movie is identifiably Greek. She is also one of the few Characters with any kind of religious ties so I think that also sets her apart just a little bit. The rich cultural ties in this movie set it apart from all other Caucasian led Disney movies because in this instance they actually embraced the culture as a whole instead of just being inspired by it.      Moana as Polynesian.   Tiana is really the first instance where Disney took total license with the setting and moved her to New Orleans and based her on The Queen of Gumbo Leah Chase. Leah Chase is a woman born of Creole parents an advocate for African American art a civil rights champion and master of Creole cooking.        All of these characters read as their intended races. It just so happens that in the early days of the company Disney used white European tellings of the stories which were arguably the most decadent to pull from for visual effects  and by far the most popular in America to use as the basis for their films. They later grew to include legends from other nonEuropean cultures Aladdin Mulan Hercules during their Renaissance era as well as tackling a form of racism head on in The Hunchback of Notre dame Frollos strongly held belief in the inferiority the wickedness and the weakness of the Roma gypsies. They largely misrepresented Pocahontas both as a character and in the factual telling of her story.  The best most realistic and attainable role model for women out of all of these fairytales in my opinion Disney animated films as a whole is Princess Tiana.     Has Disney been subtly and not so subtly racist in the past? Yes. You bet your ass they have Fantasia with the Tar Baby and the flower scenes Dumbo with the Jim Crows Song of the South in general. A lot of their early live action movies were based on source material that consisted of racist Americana like Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn... Disney does have a history of racism in those days bear in mind they were also trying to be a picture of traditional American values which at the time included both racism AND sexism However the animation of background characters in movies like Aladdin and The Hunchback of Notre Dame can also be attributed to things that look comically appealing in an animated medium such as big eyes big noses extremely fat extremely short big feet etc. Bear in mind the background characters are usually in massive groups in more comically relieving scenes and meant to both distract and capture the attention of children who may be bored or frightened especially in The Hunchback of Notre Dame where unless the gypsies are being discovered in hiding or carted away they are in the funnier numbers like Topsy Turvy and Court of Miracles.     Disney calculates every move they make to the nth degree. Especially nowadays. They dont want to offend anyone. They want to remain completely innocent and neutral. This is why unlike Loony Tunes they havent rerelease their racist material with a disclaimer. They now even stray away from characters in the parks that could be misconstrued in any way the religious connotations of both Hercules and The Hunchback of Notre Dame make them nonexistent in the theme parks outside of the occasional Halloween party appearance. They want to be a symbol of childlike purity in the minds of the masses.,rupaulsdragrace,dgob9og,40,t5_2t3or

When she arrived instead of the other queens welcoming her with open arms which they shouldve done seeing as they could all probably surmise she wasnt REALLY a threat they were cold distant and ungracious. She could probably sense that. Another queen would act out or try to prove herself even more but Cynthias a GENUINELY lovely soul so she just withdrew became quieter. You could see it in untucked barely speaking unless addressed. And fundamentally she got a second shot and knows she didnt ace it. And doesnt appear to have close friendsallies in the competition so it must have just been... Hard. It always felt like the Season  queens AND cucu. I felt really sad in that moment. Cucu is a FIERCE queen who this format doesnt do justice. Boogie on sister well be at your gigs and we fucking love you. ,rupaulsdragrace,dgx370j,267,t5_2t3or

11800271,0,t1_dgxkx1r,IIRC shes been candid in the past about the fact that shes not super into MampGs and honestly looking at her line at DragCon today I dont blame her. Shes reached critical fame status as a queen and some make it work and really get into their fame like Alyssa and Katya and some dont. I mean Mama Dont Make Me Put on the Dress Again is pretty much all about this and her lovehate relationship with drag.,rupaulsdragrace,dgxlnyv,161,t5_2t3or

But on the show addressing the political issues so far has always come from a place of positivity. Its Embracing sexual and cultural diversity is great. not Rightwing conservativism and the people who spread it are shit. And look at Rus host persona at the Snatch Game and the way the celebrity contestants are shown I dont think he would want to hold up this friendly banter thing with a queen playing someone he has all the reason to despise.,rupaulsdragrace,dgybzlw,1,t5_2t3or

Im only using Val as an example because shes in the current season that fits what Im trying to say perfectly even though I really wouldnt mind if she won. Its really sad that people just prefer her aesthetic her type than the whole spectrum. It really is a problem now that RPDR has gone mainstream.Trinity Jaymes Kimora etc. deserve better appreciation.  Im more sad about the fact that I cant be there to show them love. endrant ,rupaulsdragrace,dgynq88,8,t5_2t3or
