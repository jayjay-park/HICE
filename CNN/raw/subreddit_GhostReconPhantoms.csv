3279879,0,t3_2xp5cc,Thats their method man put out stronger and stronger weapons witheach Limited Edition or Special Edition so you HAVE to buy it and why do you? Because all the old weapons cannot stand up to these or how well armored players are due to inserts. But the worst part of all this is that the game cant achieve a fair and balance state its all about the power creep and purchasing into the latest shiny decorative toys. I bet you there is not one single person in that development or marketing team that cares one bit to balance weaponsarmors out.,GhostReconPhantoms,cp24sfv,2,t5_30zja
