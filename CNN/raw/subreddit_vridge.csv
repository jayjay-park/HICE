7494218,0,t3_4i0wmg,There are plans to do so. The RiftCat guys have a GearVR and an S but they had said they wanted to fix some problems with other phones before they released a Gear VR version of the app.The guys have a lot on their plates and have been doing an amazing job thus far. Just be patient ,vridge,d2u1wmv,1,t5_3d52p

Its the first iteration of Intel HD Graphics support so stuff might not work as expected.You need to update mobile app.,vridge,d32trxk,1,t5_3d52p
7632580,0,t3_4j5xm4,TrinusVR takes monitor output and sends it to the phone either with VR enabled or making fake VR effect through some image manipulation. This limits what games run but allows any nonVR game to work in VR.VRidge tells the computer its an HMD and takes the HMD output to send to the phone so any SteamVR or Oculus compatible game will run on VRidge properly. The limitation here would be the inability to play nonVR games as VR just in Steam Theater but compared to the benefits of actual HMD compatibility its much more useful.,vridge,d39s6zp,1,t5_3d52p
7809505,0,t3_4m6um3,Nice job to the RiftCat guys! Will have to play around with the Freetrack  Phone Sensors option pretty soon. Probably going to try out this thing with the kinect and see how good it is. Will let you guys know! ,vridge,d3tuot7,3,t5_3d52p

8223127,0,t3_4rzzsf,Seeing how difficultexpensive it will be to get a pair of lighthouses Im not convinced this will be the PERFECT way. Im not even certain what you are suggesting to do with the photodiodes. Do you want to place them all over the HMD and controllers?,vridge,d55g3q5,2,t5_3d52p

8501494,0,t1_d5tsgr0,I had the same problem with BSB seems to be a problem with some hardware and steamvr from what Ive read. You can try launching it using the Revive injector which solved the problems for me.,vridge,d648mzi,2,t5_3d52p
8694459,0,t1_d6s8zoo,Thats interesting and annoying that youve had it happen with the current version of PSMoveService. When you register it with SteamVR do you only run SteamVRInitialSetupWin.bat or do you run SteamVRInitialSetupWin.bat as well?On another note have you managed to try my build of driverleap to see if it makes any difference or not I still can only bear to use VRidge for no more than a couple of minutes because of motion sickness which has hampered my attempts at testing it? If the padding fixes driverleap then I think it will do the same for PSMoveService because I dont think it has any yet.,vridge,d6sfrb3,1,t5_3d52p

Ill try to get a new setup guide for the newest version of PS Move Service this weekend perhaps.  Lots has changed with many new filters and changes.  Pretty exciting stuff!,vridge,db5cqmp,2,t5_3d52p
10272522,0,t1_dc7ptvt,what i wrote up was a guess there may be some trickery in Vridge that further improves latency. Also what i wrote for WiFi latency is a bestcase scenario. WiFi is capable of random packet losses or hiccups due to collision with other networks or something like that so that can induce a great amount of random worst kind of latency. Making sure your wifi is jitter free can help a lot.,vridge,dc8g34c,1,t5_3d52p

10803389,0,t3_5ui2n3,Im currently using John Wick Chronicles I think it is called to test out a PS Move configuration. Half the time my hand floats off into space but when it works its really neat. I actually like the tactile feedback from the PS Move controller more than the vibration from my xbox one pad.For regular nonmotion controlled VR House of the Dying Sun is amazing. First time I really felt a sense of immersion. And Im not really into space games.,vridge,dduakmr,1,t5_3d52p
10848578,0,t3_5v2xqc,I experience almost the same thing. Occasionally I even have drifting which i suspect is attributed to frames dropping due to the stuttering. I can ignore the graphic jumps if I dont look around too much but  hours into gaming and I start getting really tired. Would love to see if anyone has some solution to this.,vridge,ddyydb7,2,t5_3d52p

11061901,0,t1_dekwdfi,Yeah not sure what is done to games when they are put into the RiftCat software but when they are they end up running flawlessly  latency tethered. Have played over  of the games in the library thus far no problems.I can use both these encoders with my current setup.Media Foundation Win  NVIDIA GeForce or Win . AMD RadeonNVENC Win  NVIDIA GeForceI noticed some of the Steam games are also in the RiftCat game list. If there would be an easy way to upload a steam game into the RiftCat software so that it can be run without Steam that would be ideal. It seems whatever is taking place with the Steam VR is where the problem occurs. ,vridge,delujz7,1,t5_3d52p

11464439,0,t3_63hsub,I can not see it having a low persistence mode which is crucial for VR I tried VR with and without low persistence and low persistence is really important. Pictures dont look sharp when you turn. In addition to that LCD displays have at least to my knowledge too much input latency to be good for VR.EDIT It has  ms input delay which is MUCH more than what for example google recommends for daydream phones with  ms as far as I know,vridge,dfvhjx1,1,t5_3d52p
