6987606,0,t1_d175ztw,Damn Im on the island. To start in focusing on walking and DDP Yoga on alternating days. The bigger focus at start is diet for me. The fact is I have a horrible diet mostly fast food way too much pop etc. I know if I can cut pop out and just eat even a little bit better Ill start losing weight. Today is day one no pop will be the hardest I think. ,SCfitness,d18dwt6,1,t5_3d7o7
6996720,0,t3_4beyqm,Did pretty good feel pretty good. Not sure if I met my goal but I did do everything I wanted in terms of my workout and meals.   minute two mileMain meal Spaghetti squash with natural home made pasta sauce fresh hand made wheat bread and a strawberry kale and blackberry smoothie.Two hour workout Admit that though it felt good I might have pushed it from being away from it for so long right awayHour of treadmillcyclewind sprint workouts belowHour of free weights. Use these and combine different sections of each one into my worksYou can follow those plans as is follow them section by section move by move or combine them like I do and never have the same workout twice.Only one I follow religiously is this one for the lower backI do it as is on the graphic everyday and helps for when youre lifting and increase the amount of weight you use. It keeps your lower back from tensing up and straining. I do it before AND after every workout. I havent had back problems in years. Even though I let myself get out of shape I still do this one and have done as much as  times a day when I wasnt working out. I even modified it for when my knees were banged up so I could do it from my bed so atleast I did something.,SCfitness,d19f6nm,1,t5_3d7o7

7029863,0,t3_4bw533,Woke up at  and ran my  miles minutes. Had my clothes right by my bedside and a banana to help with the side splints right when I woke up. Wanted to stop at about the  minute mark because my ribs were hurting when I began taking deep breaths I went to the gym about  hours earlier and did the same run. Feeling good now albeit really sore from my legs. Made a really good juice with mostly vegetables and some fruit that I drank on the way to work. Now having two strong cups of coffee. Looking to get a good salad and a Quest Bar for lunch. Another juice in the fridge here at work.The accountability and excitement of posting in these threads after having worked out really helps motivate me to go to the gym and push through. Im glad to hear you guys are sticking with it. Props to you guys who have been going all week this is only my second day.,SCfitness,d1d6tdj,4,t5_3d7o7
