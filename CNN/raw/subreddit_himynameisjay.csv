Its starting to happen at Henderson MS? now where parents and the PTA are essentially taking over the school and forcing things to finally change for the good there. All it takes is a small group of activist parents to make a change. RPS aside from the couple of flunkies that are still there who ran unopposed for their seats is finally pushing for incremental fixes to the system. This is probably the closest to optimistic Ive ever been about the city school system in regards to things finally going in the right direction but it takes more than money and an involved board. Its the parents that make the difference here and were finally starting to see their involvement make some waves. Ill end it here on this I badly want the city school system to succeed caveats aside I think that theres a chance that it might be a possibility now. ,himynameisjay,d05h5x7,2,t5_38eig

8785982,0,t1_d73wmeb,Yes and no. So apparently the teacher will only call A by his firstname and not his middle name like weve been calling him since he was born. The reason I was told was that it was the PreK policy to make sure the kid knows his name before theyll call him by a nickname which its not but whatevs. By chance last night we met a family who had this same teacher last year and had the same issue where they go with the middle name and not the first name. It sounds like this teacher is the only one that does this and made an issue out of it for the first few months with their kid and his name. They said shes a great teacher but kind of a PIA too. ,himynameisjay,d73x5r9,7,t5_38eig

9357356,0,t1_d923g60,Apparently the study abroad trip last year peru had a lot more free time and there was a lot of partying going on.  I did finally ask one of the guys if he knew how to read because all of what were were doing was on the itinerary.  When we were in Chefchaouen in the medina some kids were playing.  The boys had small toy guns and one of the dudes freaked out.  Come to find out he had served time in the war so I get it hed had kids with real guns pointed at him.  But then of course the ignorant ones had to pipe up with training them young shit.  I told that kid to shut the fuck up because its not like our kids dont play with toy guns in this country too.  I think there was just a lot of anti muslim sentiment which made me sad and is a reflection of this unfortunately.   Also having just left the party town of Torremolinos in Spain and then going to the vastly different sights and smells of Morocco was a big let down for them.  Morocco is full of poverty and lots of people live in the old cities or medinas with the narrow streets and overcrowding.  So to them it was a step back.  To me it was an experience you cant understand until youve been there and Im  grateful to have had that chance. ,himynameisjay,d92420q,2,t5_38eig

9706480,0,t1_da9j5hz,TLDR  Type in  for proper formattingActual replyFor the      like you were trying for you need three backslashes so it should look like this when you type it out     which will turn out like this The reason for this is that the underscore character this one   is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does this guy  .  Since the face of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the face this guy  .  The backslash is reddits escape character basically a character used to say that you dont want to use a special character in order to format but rather you just want it to display.  So your first  is just saying hey I dont want to italicize  so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since its just an escape character.  After this you still want the arm so you have to add two more backslashes two not one since backslash is an escape character so you need an escape character for your escape character to displayconfusing I know.  Anyways I guess thats my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lolCAUTION Probably very boring edit as to why you dont need to escape the second underscore read only if youre super bored or need to fall asleep.Edit The reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore which doesnt have an escape character doesnt have another underscore with which to italicize.  Reddits formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text then you put the text you want to format then you put the character again.  For example you would type italicize or italicize in order to get italicize.  Since we put an escape character we have italicize and dont need to escape the second underscore since theres not another nonescaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them.  So technically you could have written  but you dont need to since theres not a second nonescaped underscore.  You would need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line but not if you used a line break aka pressed enter twice.  If you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the nonescaped underscore to italicize.  To show you this you can type italicize and it should not be italicized.,himynameisjay,da9j5m4,2,t5_38eig
