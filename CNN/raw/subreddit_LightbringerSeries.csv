3495703,0,t1_cp00cjs,Actually it was Kip who stabbed Gavin with the knife although by accident and by Gavin directin the blade into himself. Andross had nothing to do with that. The changes in Andross was the effect of Kip stabbing him too with the knife in the shoulder.,LightbringerSeries,cpqqh5s,1,t5_2vbvu

7412462,0,t3_4gtlza,I hear so many people complain about the ending of the NAT and i just dont understand why.  Isnt one of the points of a story to put yourself into a different world?  A different character? Brent does an amazing job of putting you in Kylars place at the end of the trilogy.  Throughout most of the series actually.  Everyone complains that they feel Kylars heartbreak at the end of the story but thats the whole point.  The mark of a good writer or good story is at least partially how well they can get you to put yourself into the story.  To feel what the characters are feeling to understand the motives that drive them etc.  Brent does exactly that in the Night Angel Trilogy and I for one am really hoping he picks back up in Midcyru for another trilogy once the Lightbringer series is finished.,LightbringerSeries,d2kqxzl,2,t5_2vbvu
9060744,0,t3_5483bd,Whatever the synopsis says I think youre getting twisted.  I think the reference to dazen not being alone refers to the dead man keeping dazen company in his cell just like it did for the real Gavin. Its just his reflection in the mirror.  It doesnt make any sense at all for Andross to keep the real Gavin down there with Dazen.If the real Gavin survived getting half of the back of his head blown off Andross would have immediately  removed him from the prison and taken him to a chirugen. If Andross thought there was a chance he might be able to put the prism he groomed from birth back into play hed do it. Or at least have him somewhere close by getting healed up and informed about the lay of the land so he would be ready to be put into place whenever he decided it was time to do so. I think Andross would definitely choose the real Gavin to be prism over Zymun. He knows Zymun is a bit of a wild card and the real Gavin had been groomed lead as Andross wanted.  Probably taught all along to defer to Andross for any major decisions. And didnt it also mention that Gavins body had been removed from the cell when Dazen comes to and realizes where he is?Also as someone else pointed out cleave means both to bring together and to pull apart. So Weeks couldve been using the word either way in the prophecy. That allows for there to be several other ways it could be interpreted besides what you are suggesting. ,LightbringerSeries,d80yf17,1,t5_2vbvu
9263905,0,t3_56oxda,I thought they directly said you need the black seed with the knife to transfer maybe the white seed too I think andros said the knife among other things.  ,LightbringerSeries,d8q9l6y,1,t5_2vbvu
9505188,0,t1_d9kh11m,A few thoughts. As far as we know all Prisms have been the Chromerias Prisms starting with Lucidonius. Could it be that there were Black Prisms before him?. I really want to know how old the Blinding Knife is. Is it older than the Chromeria or did somebody create it and use it to forge the Chromeria.      If its older than the Chromeria that would lead us to the conclusion that there were more Prisms before the Chromeria. But that goes against the idea that Prisms were created to balance the Colors and weaken the gods. ,LightbringerSeries,d9kptgv,1,t5_2vbvu

9743656,0,t1_dadkpbr,Thats a fair point but the blue luxin would probably cut him up something fierce shoving it down his throat,LightbringerSeries,dae48z1,1,t5_2vbvu
9908671,0,t1_dallpje,Ive had the same thought that Dazen killed his brother. I know it doesnt fit character right. Well what if that was the very first time Dazen drafted black luxin. He was only a boy and we know colors effect a drafter the strongest the first few times. He drafted black lost control and killed his brother. If you go back and read the passage where he dreams about the murder he mentions some details about sevastians look of suprise and details about the murder that Dazen should have only seen if he was in front of his brother. Not entering the room while his brother has his back to him facing the color white in the window. Also Dazen mentions how Gavin was not only not impressed by Dazen drafting blue but annoyed by it. Just some thoughts Ive had about it. ,LightbringerSeries,daz4g8m,2,t5_2vbvu
9953357,0,t1_db42opq,Thanks. Ive been rereading recently and highlighting everything that could possibly be a hidden easter egg or world building on my kindle hoping to write some of it up here. Its a lot of fun. Even in the first few chapters of BP theres interesting coincidences. Like when we meet Lina and one eye is fully dilated and the other is a pin prick. Yes this is a possible effect of a serious head wound but its also very similar to what we see in Kip after the yellow storm. ,LightbringerSeries,db4y4nq,4,t5_2vbvu
