Later when they were getting back together she said What if I do something stupid and break up with you again? and when Leonard suggested the possibility he could break up with her she laughed at him.Even though she knows she is far less successful than Leonard she now seems to think that her looks more than make up for that and that Leonard should be happy to have her rather than the other way around.,bigbangtheory,cg9xqe0,2,t5_2s85x

7789644,0,t3_4lyhb5,I dont think Sheldon goes in for anyone elses interpretation of reality. At one point he suggests to Leonard that neither of them are really beholden to normal societal laws because they are superior and references Nietzsches suggestion that superior men should perhaps live by their own morality. Either way I dont think he really cares much about the moral judgments of the Backwater state he comes from. I think he avoided sex because it scared him. He hates intimacy fears germs is not fond of squishy things. As to caffeine and alcohol he probably has some logical qualms in addition to the promise he made to his mother about drugs which he logically took to mean caffeine and alcohol while she obviously meant hard drugs. After all he seems to drink on occasion now drinking liquor punch in the recent celebration and loving every minute of it.

She doesnt show up until much of the episode is over because Amy simply doesnt have a natural connection to any character other than Sheldon.  And Sheldon leaves her hanging again this time refusing to propose.  It is the same dynamic as Sam and Diane on Cheers.  Sheldon and Amy cant get married or even engaged so it is better for Amy to go away and introduce a character analogous to Rebecca who can challenge Sheldon.,bigbangtheory,d7ua13q,7,t5_2s85x

Penny gets a part in a Pilot Lenard and Sheldon get the Nobel together Amy is pregnant after her and Sheldon get married and Sheldon reacts to be happier about the child then the Nobel Bernie finds a cure for some obscure thing Howard reveals he got his PHD. The last scene is the having one last take out meal when there is a knock at the door and its Stewart who everyone forgot to invite to the wedding. This ending leaves everything open but people happy. I like the idea of Penny getting a Pilot rather than a movie because it leaves it open to whether she succeeds. I wouldve said she gets a Pilot made which is basically the BBT but that would make me hate her and shes actually been really likable since the marriage.,bigbangtheory,dafe51g,13,t5_2s85x

Sheldon the most intelligent and peculiar one and is a pain to live with and has good relationship with his mother and grandmother. Leonard the one trying his hardest to get a girlfriend and overcoming his embarrassing childhood were he was bullied daily. Howard the horny and funny engineer who has a weird relationship with his mother and Raj the foreign nerd who cant even speak to women.Now Leonard has a wife Howards mum is dead and he has a regular life and raj can speak to women.
