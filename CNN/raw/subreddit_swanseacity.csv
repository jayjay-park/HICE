324025,0,t1_cfdsac3,I didnt think it was a poor performance. We struggled to break down Stokes defense but we played well out wide controlled possession and came back from a goal behind. We made twice as many shots as Stoke with a couple that were very close and without the whipping winds I could see some more of those going our way. We were playing without Shelvey and without Michu and we went down a goal early playing away. The squad looked unfazed by first goal and really just pushed on. I dont mean to argue with you but I thought it was a good match and it could have easily gone our way.  ,swanseacity,cfectjr,1,t5_2tip4

1660562,0,t1_cjogrxq,I really like the fantasy update idea.  I think we could also have a continuous competition for the video games.  We could have tournaments or title holders like boxing.  I also think player spotlights would be interesting.  Maybe every week we could post information on the player and recent stats that could encourage discussion in the comments.  I dont know though I think were making progress but youre right about the limited contributors.Also I think weekly ranking polls would be cool.

3050410,0,t3_2v3pvt,Fisrt off good that we got back and salvaged a point. On the other hand bad that we didnt manage to win it.Gomis just doesnt cut it he doesnt activate the others when hes holding up the ball doesnt get into scoring positions enough nor does he actually capitalize on the chances he get. Oliveira looked good when he came on time to let him have a go? In my opinion long overdue. Great to have Ki back and together with Cork the midfield looked solid. If you disregard the typical stupid yellow card of the oh so typical Swansea zeitgeist I think Cork did very well. Neither Barrow or Dyer had any real impact today so its good Montero is back. First half were dominated by stupid decisions or just wrong decisions in possession. This led to Sunderland having lots of the ball and the Swans lagging one step behind. The second half was much better putting much more pressure on Sunderland forcing them back. Overall I think a point is fairish but honestly this is a game which should have been three.,swanseacity,coe68yn,3,t5_2tip4

I have no doubt he will not embarrass himself and some of you fans will love that you will never be able to count his team out.

With the defensive discipline he has instilled in the team I think we will be more solid now as the back line will be more effectively shielded by the midfield. Furthermore Clement says that Amat and VdH are pushing for spots and he is optimistic about his ability to improve them. If the gaffer is happy I think we have to back to boys at the back... put off dreams of a new leader for our defense until the summer and hope that the young players mature under Clements guidance.,swanseacity,dd4minw,14,t5_2tip4

11645137,0,t1_dgf1xnj,gtDropping out of the premier league would be catastrophic for us.I dont agree with this.I dont want us to get relegated obviously. However weve built this club up from the scrapheap during our rise with state of the art facilities and an evergrowing core support base. Were not ever going to be a top flight stalwart were too small and likely always will be. However weve built up to the point now where we could be among the top two divisions for a long time assuming no catastrophic boardlevel management from this point onwards. If it got that bad then survival this year makes little difference either way.Id ask you and anyone of a similar mindset  what does being in the top flight mean? When the fixtures come out at the start of the season are there games that you are truly excited to find out when we play them? When we start in our early cup rounds do you hope to see a very strong side to smash it and go all the way or do you feel that getting knocked out early isnt so bad because we can focus on the league? What are we going to achieve in the league long term? How thrilling was our th place finish under Monk for you?This isnt meant as a hostile response by the way just an opposing point of view. I think football is about the highs and lows and you cant have one without the other. Look how frustrated Arsenal fans are and they consistently finish top  and win the occasional FA Cup. Holding on to the desire to push for midtable league finishes consistently with a low priority on winning silverware through cup competition is the road to disillusionment. So long as the long term health of the club isnt under threat I dont see any outcome this season being catastrophic.,swanseacity,dgfznhr,3,t5_2tip4
