2604936,0,t3_2pmi3i,Im not sure if this applies to you but Im in a similar boat and this is basically my thoughts on the topic. When youre first starting out you are limited by experience. The only way to get some experience is to just get out there and build something. Start small. A good place to start would be a basic portfolio project just give google a quick search for portfolio project ideas. One suggestion I saw was to pick a local taco joint and design a website for them put up a splash page with information have another page for their menu a form for submitting feedback to the restaurant it doesnt have to do anything just build the frontend.Start simple. Pick your layout and color scheme. What information are you going to display? How are you going to display it? Tweak. Perfect what you have. Add in new sections and additional pages. Fix what you break. But most importantly keep it simple. Build from what you know. Want to add some bells and whistles? Look up a tutorial on how to use CSS transitionsanimations or create your own SVG icons. Get a github account and start learning git while building your static website. Host it on github pages. Look up CSS extension languages like LESS and Sass. Research responsive design grid layouts media queries... theres tons of tech out there that adds on to what you already know.Your first website should suck. Your second website will suck a little bit less. With experience and time your sites start to resemble something... usable. The key is motivating yourself and being able to deal with the frustration that comes from not being able to build what you want out of the gate.Not sure if this advice helps but thats my current gameplan.,learnwebdev,cmylpau,1,t5_2s76w
3635942,0,t3_3205k0,Hi there. You got a lot of stuff going on here so I will try to break it down clearly.HTMLThis    lta classbggtltagtis not a link and the way its placed on the page suggests that you meant for it to be a ltdivgt.If you want your images to be responsive dont set hard dimensions inline like so         ltimg srcimagesslimekeeperhome.png classhomelogo height width altSlimekeeper HomegtInline meaning that the dimensionsstyling are on the tag instead of being handled with CSS. You can do something like    .mobilelogo img         width px        height px         Or use width  so the img scales relative to its container    CSSYoure mixing pixels and ems when setting margins on different elements. Its a good idea to stick with one or the other best practices being use pixels for positioning ems or pixels for font size. You will also need to change widths of elementslayout as the screen sizes shrink so that design is mobile friendly.Try using a smaller media query width and work your way up. Ex     media maxwidth px          Styles     Also the media queries were missing px after the width values.This bit of CSS here    .tab maxwidth px     marginright em    is not valid. Im assuming that you wanted this element in a media query like so    media maxwidth px         .tab     NotesRun your HTML through a validator and see if everything follows WC standards. There is also a CSS validatorWhew thats a lot! I know that I didnt quite answer too deeply about responsive CSS because you are on the right track with media queries. ,learnwebdev,cq6q3tf,2,t5_2s76w
