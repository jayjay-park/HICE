8945302,0,t1_d7n38tw,Thanks! I wouldnt actually call myself a good writer but Im good at writing certain things. One thing I hate writing is dialogue. This is actually a big reason Im keeping other characters and dialogue to a minimum.Im actually writing this as if the character was me. Its a self insert but it works. Ive also avoided gendering the protagonist or naming them or doing really anything that would make the reader feel they are not the hero of the story. I do some things well this whole thing just happens to luckily be that one thing.,TheCryopodToHell,d7n3db7,18,t5_3gb4u

I never put my work behind a paywall just like I said I wouldnt. I actually never said paycheck because theres nothing wrong with being compensated for your work. You can even look around in those early parts.

11371562,0,t1_dfkc9fz,Yes but he said glow not illuminate.  Glow is typically used to describe something that gives off enough light to see it but not enough light to illuminate its surroundings. Like wearing a white shirt at night.Think of a flashlight and a glow stick.  Would you describe a flashlight as a device that glows even though it technically does or as device that illuminates or lights up an area? Would you describe a glow stick as a device that helps you see in the dark even though it technically does or as a way to make people see you?  If there is enough glowing an area can be illuminated.  So the idea is that the sheer number of glowing spirit trails causes the area to be illuminated.,TheCryopodToHell,dfky1l4,4,t5_3gb4u
