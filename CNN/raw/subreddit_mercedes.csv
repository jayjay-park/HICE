4751960,0,t1_ctth4uu,Traction and stability control are still on with it set to off. They just dont engage at the slightest hint of wheel spin. Default mode is way overactive for a car with any sporting pretensions. They probably should have labeled it sport like the do the transmission mode. ,mercedes,cttj2i8,2,t5_2qyjk
4879963,0,t1_cu9j8pp,Well I think suspension may need some refurbishment apart from that I would definitely and thoroughly check the electronical equipments sunroof antenna windows any extras as they can be frustrating but I never had any issues with those. If you have a mechanic you trust its always a good idea to invite himher along to the inspection before purchasing. I always found the car totally reliable so cant give you a proper advice but check who you are buying from and keep in mind that even that the car is ish old the OEM parts wont be cheap and aftermarket stuff has to be good quality to avoid further issues. Still its a good looking car has enough space for  a useful size trunk and its RWD. Its a good choice but as PowerPickle said the car must have either a good past or a previous owner who fixed the issues caused by careless owners if there were any.,mercedes,cu9nnul,2,t5_2qyjk
