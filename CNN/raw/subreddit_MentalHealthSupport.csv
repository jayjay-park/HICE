2818148,0,t3_2s7azf,Greetings all.Second try... sigh... lol MDD and bipolar. Ive never thought about suicide but Ive had many days thinking that if I didnt wake up that would be cool. Tired tired is what I am most of the time. I dont connect with people well. I want to be among the group but never feel like I belong there. I have friends who care but I have no idea why. Apparently its insulting to say that out loud to them go figure. I dont really know what I hope to get out of this sub but having a place to go where folks have the same sort of problems would be nice. The other subs are ok no issue with them. Ive happily given advice but rarely asked for it. Not that I dont want it just that it doesnt occur to me to ask. Im good at wanting to help not so good at asking for it. Ive had to change psychiatrists old one moved the nerve of some people. In making this change Ive been offered the services of a therapist as well. This is new for me hoping itll help me figure out the whole connecting with people thing. Ill keep you posted first visit is next Tuesday. Heres to the beginning of a new sub. I hope we are all able to find strength and support from each other. ,MentalHealthSupport,cnof06w,3,t5_35ulb
2818236,0,t1_cnoe003,Me too hon. I dont know how to feel included or worthwhile. Im hoping the new therapist will have a clue or two.  I promise to share. ,MentalHealthSupport,cnofd6j,3,t5_35ulb
2822608,0,t1_cnowzzh,shit son tears me up. thanks  right back atcha. glad I have this forum to be thoroughly honest. Since I started going to AA and regularly seeing a psychologist about four or five months ago Ive gained this erie selfawareness that kinda creeps me out. Ive learned so much about myself and it really helps to be able to talk about it with people who get where Im coming from. Sometimes when Im honest about how Im feeling others find it disturbing. Nice to know we arent alone.  ,MentalHealthSupport,cnoxa4i,2,t5_35ulb
2836026,0,t1_cnqfdef,I totally get that. Its easy to get lost connecting things to each other. Maybe try writing stuff down? Even if you never show anyone that can be a great way to unburden your mind organize your thoughts and focus on one thing at a time. Maybe the psychologist can help you prioritize. I think focusing hard on selfcare helped me a lot with the other stuff maybe itd help you too.Now if I would just take my own advice...,MentalHealthSupport,cnqgayw,2,t5_35ulb
