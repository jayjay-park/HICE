2299395,0,t3_2llicw,I dont have any finches I just lurk the sub... I wish I could have finches though! but they shouldnt hurt. I have parrots as well and if I remember correctly peppers might actually taste sweet! Ive fed bell peppers to them but never anything too hot. Thats because we never buy them. Id chop up a slice of bell pepper into small pieces so the finches can eat them. The flakes dont sound bad either but I dont have any experience with them. ,Finches,clvx6so,1,t5_2u1p9
2497695,0,t1_cmjn4sn,Ive actually found that zebras are louder than society finches but I guess it depend on what type of sound you find pleasant. I have eight society hens and they make a sound that is very similar to a cricket but they are generally pretty quiet most of the day.Zebras are also much more aggressive than societies and I wouldnt necessarily trust them as much with the canary. ,Finches,cmkl55a,3,t5_2u1p9
