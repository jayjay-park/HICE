3866854,0,t1_cqx1vdp,gtDo you think you have a preference of one sex over another? I dont have a preference for a particular gender.  However I do more often come across women I find attractive than men I find attractive. Which maybe would put me at a  on the Kinsey Scale  I dont have a large enough sample size yet to draw any conclusions on how often I am attracted to nonbinary people PgtAlso is there a NJB or NJG in your life right now?Sadly no....,gayjews,cqx1zug,1,t5_2uhrk

I dont love reform services though and I tend not to like the suburban conservative ones though I enjoy them in new york city and probably other cities but I havent been. I dont know Im difficult I dont like anything PWhen I lived in the city I enjoyed going to Hadar and I also like Fort Tryon Jewish Center  Both of those are sort of nondenominationalConservative.,gayjews,cqz3he2,2,t5_2uhrk

The Talmud is a very legalistic book and both movements claim to be Halakhic organizations in that they believe in a binding system of Halakhic law. ,gayjews,crsuy28,1,t5_2uhrk
