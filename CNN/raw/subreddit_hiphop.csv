86272,0,t3_1v2y60,I liked Blu but he didnt catch on. I believe one of the reasons he didnt catch on was that he bragged about being a bully in his younger years. Where as most other alternative rap artist talk more so about being picked on for being different. Which people like myself can relate too. ,hiphop,ceo91ss,2,t5_2qh2e

I personally wouldnt go through the trouble of counting his words Id just like to see where he would fall on the list.  Dose One too.  Then Aes wouldnt be a statistical outlier.

9141322,0,t3_55hpi2,Heres some from my favorites list but be aware my tastes delve into the much more dense and indirect lyrical styles.The granddaddy of dense lyrical stylingAesop RockEDIT  Just for lulz this is how you make an entire song devoted to your pet cat.EDIT Should probably also link something that got released a few days ago which is absolutely awesome for me its a collaboration with Aesop Rock and Homeboy SandmanInstead of giving an example of Alias Sage Francis and Prolyphic individually lemme give a collab track where theyre just describing whatever pops into their minds on the topic of winter.Actually gonna give one from just Sage because hes that good. Also should probably link the song that got me interested in rap in the first placeAlthough a little more niche I really like the lyrics of Dan Bull even though he almost exclusively makes songs about computer games.I think most rap fans regardless of their individual tastes would agree that Atmosphere is pretty damn good.And now for something a little weirder...EDIT  Actually as long as Im linking weird stuff heres something a little stranger. A battle rap with an extremely chill backing track and voiceAnd now for something a little more lightheartedPickup sThats off the top of my head. If you absolutely love any of these happy to give some more in that vein.,hiphop,d8aq894,1,t5_2qh2e
