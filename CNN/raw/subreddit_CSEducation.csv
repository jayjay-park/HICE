981481,0,t3_25chpm,Sounds like a great time to pick a project and run with it! Make a Java app make a web site with a Java server make an Android app ... The actual idea should come from you and be something youre interested in.  Just ask questions in a relevant subreddit if you get stuck.,CSEducation,chfup7w,1,t5_2v2fg
1023368,0,t3_222qf6,I think some of this depends on the school and the level at which the class is accepted.If they consider it to be part of their technical education route and you are drawing students that do not really want to program some of the other options like A may be more practical for them.  Consider what level the school needs filled and will have interest versus the other classes and routes available.  If they need a class on a college prep sort of route thats different than if they need a more technical education to an immediate job route or even just an artsy extra options to fill an elective.  Computer media seems to be popular here though Im not certain how valuable it ends up being for most of them.  A lot of people who arent interested in computers would also do well with some basics just to get them through whatever else they are focusing on.As far as programming...  are they going to take an AP class later or have any option of doing so or maybe just advanced students trying the test?  If they want to do the AP exam for college credit its in java.  Thats a reasonable choice if they have any hope of trying that exam for credit or following up with an AP course.  If not a lot of the college intros Ive seen lately are python or java.  ,CSEducation,chkm3cv,1,t5_2v2fg
7671175,0,t3_4kam5c,We have a new assessment in our course where we have students explain  automatically chosen lines of their final project. Its very illuminating both in terms of who cant explain their code and what kinds of code the class struggles with which helps us refine our curriculum.,CSEducation,d3e62e2,5,t5_2v2fg

9923442,0,t1_dazqyth,I currently go to Augusta. Idk how I feel about cyber security honestly. I am going to be getting an advanced cyber cert just because the ways the classes are offered. If I just pursued a Computer Science degree at Augusta Id be forced to take only  to  classes a semester because the way the availability of the classes are offered. Its gonna take me  years to graduate from Augusta and this is supposed to be my senior year,CSEducation,db11sir,1,t5_2v2fg
