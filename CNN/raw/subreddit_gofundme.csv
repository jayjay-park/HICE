3619741,0,t3_31toz8,Hello I am the caretaker of my husband who is a veterans from the Marine corps and is the only young  percent disabled veteran on our entire island in Hawaii Hilo Hawaii. He needs allot of help and all assistance is on other islands or in the mainland. Isaac is so severe and the Island so not equipped to handle him or combat veterans that the VA has told him to see outside doctors because of his violence or fly to other islands by himself and drive and live by himself just to stay at a clinic for  weeks and thats just one session. He feels as though hes trapped and has NO comrades anymore especially since I have first hand accounts now of how the VA takes care of there troops its awful. I am trying to help gather funds to move to Colorado where there is family programs and school transfers for Hawaii students. Any help would be appreciated thanks.,gofundme,cq4vl2u,1,t5_2vdzc

For example our friends Steve and Laurie are trying to provide our veterans with a nice hot shower each and every morning through Showers of Hope. This act of charity was born from an act of pure Christianity and love for fellow man. But as with any great thing it cannot be accomplished alone.Please join together with us to make a difference. Whether it be by donating sharing this post liking commenting or making a post of your own! With your help we can lift up those hands which hang hopelessly down and spread love of neighbor God and our veterans all ,gofundme,cx2bgde,1,t5_2vdzc

But they have big hearts and have decided to adopt but this is a long process and is rather expensive sometimes. So this GoFundMe is to help them achieve their dream of having a family of their own.
