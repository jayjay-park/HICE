7788819,0,t1_d3qgdey,Not all of them were opposed to the bombings apparently. Skimming through it I find that JOHN McCLOY concludes they had missed their opportunity to get the Japanese to accept the ultimatum. JOSEPH GREW says the same as well as simply noting that it would have been preferable if the bombs didnt need to be dropped which is obvious but not that they didnt need to be dropped.So yeah the big issue is that they didnt tell the Japanese they were willing to let the Emperor keep his throne which they did anyway. In hindsight it looks like an easy solution which it is but they lacked hindsight. So while I am against the nuking Im not certain that it was obvious to them back then it could have been avoided. Then again this subject is still a matter of controversy to this day.,WehraboosInAction,d3riq6s,3,t5_3esji
