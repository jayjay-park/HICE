These are going to be trying times for everyone and we need to be organized for a variety of causes.I think organizing for economic security and climate resilience are also very very important.     On the economic front Im a big fan of the ideas being put forward in this movement Another aspect of all this is that we have to be able to help our companions in rural America. I consider a very important article to read on the plight of the people in rural locations and how we misunderstand it especially in light of current events We also have to make ourselves resilient for climate change. This involves food security and ability to continue to maintain clean water access. Im a fan of this book and some of the stuff it details on this A similar idea as the ones Ive mentioned that I think is very useful is Marjorie Kellys framework of Extractive Ownership vs Generative Ownership Very influential way of looking at things and fixing the ills of neoliberal capitalism.     Just to link a bunch of pet things Im interested in I guess. All our problems are interlocking IMO. Our culture of mass consumerism and extractive business structures Wall Street inequality globalization environmental destruction climate change I think it is all connected and there are certain things which are beneficial in the fight of almost all of them at once.,EnviroUnderground,d9zdqlu,2,t5_3hi05
