147843,0,t1_cev8x6z,I run ...  The unpatched version is notorious for having game breaking bugs.  A bit of googling says that versions prior to . created Error  due to several quests sharing common quest locations.  This does not seem to match your problem though.  I have not played without patch in the past  years I just remember how painful it was.Installing the patch in dosbox is easy.  Just run the .exe from the dosbox command line    Cgt cd dagger    CDAGGERgt dagDownside you may have to start over.  I strongly recommend to patch.  You can race through Privateers Hold the starting dungeon in a couple of minutes.  Follow the corridor kill the rat and the bat.  Leave the archer alone in his room he wont jump over the tables.  Doge the skeleton while running upstairs.  Jump onto the platform with the throne flip the lever.  The platform goes up.  Follow the corridor on your right the one that goes up.  Kill the rat.  Continue.  Theres a door on your right.  Save because theres an imp behind that door.  Open the door rush to the exit.,Daggerfall,cev9qo4,1,t5_2sjrj

1705521,0,t1_cjttaad,Its fun. Try it. Mute your sound in beginning dungeon. Longtime players know why.,Daggerfall,cju55qv,2,t5_2sjrj
2104721,0,t1_cl75wh7,Kind of a combination of the two. I had a very modest laptop nothing gaming oriented. So I was pretty limited in what games I could play. Daggerfall had gone free from Bethesda so I figured Id download it and finally get around to beating it. The other side of things I played as a kid back when my mom got it in . Ive always loved the game. When you have that kind of time and limited resources you kind of go back you know?,Daggerfall,cl7ctby,2,t5_2sjrj
3731342,0,t1_cqhkxr9,Do you have those  virtual buttons that Dosbox adds? Theyre very useful for me I have A bound as enter and in daggerfall I have enter bound as show mouse so I can use A for both showing the mouse and entering when I need to type something. B is bound to esc if I need to access options C for inventory and D for map.,Daggerfall,cqhli48,1,t5_2sjrj
3819793,0,t3_343okv,If its a relatively small town you can just switch to info mode and click on houses.  Normal houses just say residence but the quest objective house will have the name.,Daggerfall,cqrorbo,1,t5_2sjrj
3984196,0,t1_crafk3v,To be honest I only recommend Pis for people familiar with Linux as I have been using it as my Main OS since I was in Middleschool and Im now in College. So its something Im VERY familiar with and Debian specifically is the easiest distro to use Ubuntu is even a derivative of Debian and it uses .DEB packages however it has its own Repositories and it uses a different method of package distribution that IMHO is superior to debian. ,Daggerfall,crafmgf,2,t5_2sjrj
4634113,0,t1_cteni5v,You seem to have misunderstood something here. The rendering resolution of the game will always be the original one. You can either run fullscreen at that resolution or run fullscreen at  with the rendered game scaled to match that resolution. There isnt much of a difference visually but the second option does have more pixels displayed.Unless a game engine replacement for Daggerfall is completed we wont be able to make the game render more than x pixels. There is such a project but its pretty much stalled right now and I dont expect it to be completed before years if at all...,Daggerfall,ctep6fl,1,t5_2sjrj
