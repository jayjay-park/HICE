9272654,0,t3_57bgfq,Teams play Alabama with a nothing to lose mindset and thats not an easy thing to compete against week after week. Think about some of the teams that other top teams lose to. Alabama steps on the field most weeks against top ten teams and absolutely steamrolls them. Then other extremely talented teams with good playmaking QBs play lights out and might figure out how to beat us. Does Bama ever get blown out? No. Last year against Ole Miss we couldnt have possibly made any more mistakes than we made and we still had multiple opportunities to win that game. Last year Deshaun Watson played an unbelievable game against us and put up crazy numbers. But you know what? He probably played the best game of his season and lost because we were just that good. No other team was able to beat him.The fact of the matter is that Alabama sits at the top and people analyze every aspect of the team to find weaknesses. If you know you cant run the football youre probably going to throw more than usual. Against Arkansas our offense scored so fast that our defense barely had time to catch its breath. We do miss assignments in coverage from time to time just like any other team. But when a team can run and pass for  in the same game thats when Ill worry about our defense. ,rolltide,d8rdj3x,7,t5_2sanc

9847852,0,t3_5gcs5j,The first quarter was one of the weirdest quarters Ive witnessed.  We crushed them but it was honestly an up and down performance.  We got lucky with some of the turnovers that gave us a comfortable lead early.  Our passrush was virtually nonexistent until the th quarter when we knew they had to pass.  Against a patchwork offensive line like that its not encouraging.  Allowing Appleby to throw for  yards concerns meStill we dominated.  We got our shit together and rolled.  Florida rushed for zero yards.  We finally scored more nonoffensive touchdowns.  Our threeheaded monster at running back is insane.  I love the Bottering ram in the second half.  Trevon Diggs is gonna be something special once he gets more opportunities to eat.Theres a lot to correct and work on.  Hamiltons injury doesnt look good hopefully wrong on that but at least theres plenty of time to get Evans up to speed.  His working with the ILBs all offseason could really pay off now.Also as much as we hate Verne he was a legend and I will miss him.  It was time for him to go but Im glad we got to see him out.Edit Harris should break  in the semifinal.  Hurts needs us to make it to the championship and needs  total to do it.  Itll be interesting to see if Scarbrough passes Jacobs for third on the team.  This is also the first time weve had four players with at least  rushing yards under Saban.  No idea when the last time our team has done that.Edit  I believe this could be the first time in school history we have four rushers with at least  yards.,rolltide,dar74pf,12,t5_2sanc

9880751,0,t3_5gv1tu,Even if you could say objectively that Hurts was the worst QB I would reply how much does it matter? Certainly QBs are important and are supposed to lead the team but there are ten other offensive players on the field at a time as well as the eleven on defense. Football is a team sport and I believe that the team is successful based on the play of every player not just the QB. Even with that being said Jalen has proved he can win without being perfect or even the best QB on the field. He uses his running ability more often than any other QB in the playoff with the possible exception of JT Barrett he can hand the ball off to a stable of great running backs his throwing ability has improved over the season he has great receivers and tight ends to throw to a good oline and the best defense in the nation to bail him out if he commits a turnover. His biggest strength is his ability to stay calm and focused in the face of opposition. When he made mistakes he came out and contiued to play and win the game. Debating the best QB is fun obviously but moot in terms of winning the game. That being said the opposite is true for our opponants. If you want to beat us it all starts with the QB,rolltide,davhh1r,3,t5_2sanc

The benefit it working on proper throwing mechanics leads to more accuracy balls thrown harder and just consistency in general.

I also think itll be a good year for our receivers if the running game can be explosive. Ridley and Foster will be good guys to throw to. It all depends on his mental capabilities and timing on the long ball. It has to be there and be consistent or itll be another year of our defense having to find a way to put up points to keep the game out of reach. So to answer youre question. I think hell have a better season passing but he might not have to run as much.
