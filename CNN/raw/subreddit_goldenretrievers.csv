148344,0,t1_cev5cl8,Yeah I was going to say  is closer to something you would see on kijiji....I paid  for my guy from a reputable breeder. Other places I looked were closer to . Edit I would also say that a breeder that allows two puppies from the same litter to go together is not very reputable. My mom asked our breeder if she ever had anyone want two and she said people ask for two all the time but she wont do it. Her reasons were that people dont realize how much work two puppies is and that they will bond to each other and not the family. She instead tells them to take the one puppy then if they still want another to come back in a year.,goldenretrievers,cevbsgq,1,t5_2st00
190141,0,t3_1wa0hi,Sounds like hes just excited. If hes in the back then its going to be hard to train him to stop because you wont be facing him and wont be able to show him how to behave correctly. You could try a form of immersion therapy where you put him in the back and read a book in the drivers seat for long enough for him to chill out a few times a week. Maybe take him on a short drive around the neighborhood to make sure he doesnt learn the difference between  the car moving and the car not moving. In any case like I said hes probably just excited. I know that when my Duke would see the car doors open he got extremely excited because he knew that we were going to a park or to a lake and those were his favorite things to do.,goldenretrievers,cf03ht1,4,t5_2st00

We live on a hobby farm and raise chickenscows in the summer so the butchering process often leaves us with a bunch of chicken necks and cow organs which we also give to her occasionally. She also gets her daily grains from all the corn in the cow shit she eats. She hunts bunnies too so god only knows how many of those shes eaten.

6864990,0,t3_49r09l,Ultimately you should discuss with a vet but weve got a  year old with relatively mild hip dysplasia and he gets ball every day. We keep it on even soft terrain and limit duration. He will be stiff getting up later if hes been laying in the same position for a while but it seems to be at a sustainable level and he just loves ball too much to deprive him of it. Honestly he is pretty pissed about the reduction in ball time as it is.So I would say to me it doesnt sound like too much on the face of it but ultimately it depends on exactly how much how much trouble shes actually having getting up etc.Can you get to a vet in the near future and get it checked out?,goldenretrievers,d0uggu4,2,t5_2st00

7824706,0,t3_4mggd9,Im super interested in this. They are absolutely service dogs.....and you should not have any problem claiming it as such. I cant speak to your current situation but let me give you mine.I work as a police officer and have for ten years. A few years ago I had a particular critical incident that altered my life forever. This along with the constant tragedy I experience daily began to take its toll. I found comfort in one thing...and that was my Golden Retriever. She came along at the right time and lifted me above the bad and still does to this day. Shes my constant. The one thing I know will be there. She got me through a dark time and Im much better now! I always know that the bad things I deal with at work will be washed away by the good times I have with my Golden. Shes such a blessing!Dont let anyone judge you. No one knows what its like to be you. I would be elated to have a prescription for an ESA. No one can ever tell you ever again that your best friend isnt welcome to be with you. I would rock that ESA Golden Retriever harder than anyone else ever has!,goldenretrievers,d3vkatt,4,t5_2st00
