6916697,0,t1_d104nut,I do believe cyclists belong on sidewalks. Theyre significantly less likely to be hit by a car and there is usually space for them at any given point of the day. Of course theres certain places and certain times of day where a sidewalk is busy with pedestrians but the majority of the time most sidewalks are empty and his clips clearly show that. Plus a collision between a cyclist and a pedestrian isnt likely to be as serious as a collision between a cyclist and a car.I dont doubt that at times emergency manoeuvres for cyclists are always a possibility and the conditions of the roads in Calgary increase the likeliness of having to make one. For that reason it further validates why cyclists belong on sidewalks and not on roads.Also I never said they should die I said this specific person is a whiny bitch and I hope someone hits them someday.,CalgaryDashCams,d10bwyj,-2,t5_32tqe
