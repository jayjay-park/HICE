3799573,0,t1_cm8gi4l,SIM card chips debit card card chips etc are all technically embedded targets.Heres a bit of a trivia TILNow dont get me wrong I personally would burn Java in a slow fire but we have to acknowledge where acknowledgement is due the truth of the matter is there is a lot of embedded stuff out there running Java. They are just not arduinopopular.,embedded,cqpdq4q,1,t5_2qins

7027234,0,t3_4bvvyo,Well the Arduino project is based on AVR MCU so that could be a start.Otherwise it seems that most of the cool stuff is happening in ARMland now mostly STM and a bit of NXP from what I see. You could pick a Nucleo board for a few  and play a bit with this platform which has a lot more potential.,embedded,d1cw1yw,1,t5_2qins

7160070,0,t1_d1ryi2c,Exactly.The endurance of flash will vary between lots wafers and even within the same wafer. Sometimes the process might drift and get close to violating the spec. So long as the manufacturer are confident of it meeting spec they will ship it. So you should never assume any better than what the manufacturer specifies.Source worked at an Atmel fab and once did overtime testing flash endurance in the early hours of a Sunday morning because of a process issue.,embedded,d1s141i,5,t5_2qins

7511275,0,t3_4i2tze,This stuff is interesting. I have been looking at various OS for my needs for an IoT application. I would like to know a few things ? Can you point out the advantages over Contiki RIOT and TinyOS    Definitely one of them is the open source BLE stack which no one provides. What are other advantages ?  Does the HAL also have support for deviceschips like GPS accelerometers pollution sensors humidity sensors etc or is it mostly interfaces ? Would the next release allow pairing with data transactions including audio and video ? What are the advantages of tickless functionality ?Cheers!SB,embedded,d2vztbj,1,t5_2qins

11052638,0,t3_5xto5o,The other choice that would be logical is embedded Linux.  Looks like AMD is helping Mentor support an open build of Linux for the G seriesId recommend a Yocto system build if you plan to do it.  I think Monty now supports Chromium.

11471718,0,t1_dfvrds4,awesome to hear! yeah just the fact that I can create a new VM without sitting there manually installing everything sold me on it. I have it working with USB. and everything great but as of now it isnt much different than my old way except the setup is much faster and I can share the vagrant file.So getting completionlint on my host from the guest would be the next step and would be really great. I just dont really know much about it I guess. Whenever I set up an editor on a guest machine it just works for the most part sitting in the same environment as the SDK and all. But I presume hostgtguest would have to go over the SSH connection? It would be awesome to just let everyone use whatever OSeditor they like and have customized without polluting their host with weird toolchains. I use windowsQTcreator most of the time or sublimetext if the project isnt huge. Or linux if I dont have to use windows only tools for other tasks.,embedded,dfwbb63,1,t5_2qins
