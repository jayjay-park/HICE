6865302,0,t3_49rnnj,weeeeeeeell superman got away with it for years I mean think about it it is really really easy to forget someone thats not important at the time. for instance try to remember the name of the last waiter or waitress you had its not even close to easy unless special circumstances take place your waiterwaitress your friend old coworker so on and so on now take into view we are looking into the world. So of course we can see it. now with Hawk moth authors like giving red herrings i mean really like it its kind of a sport. how many of us spotted snape being a good guy before the end of the series? chances are yes they are one in the same chances are no they are not one in the same and its not what we think. All we know is speculation and though its fun we cant wright anything into fact until it is fact even if we think its obvious. There are countless times this has happened most recently with star wars  I mean how hard did america work to keep that a secret? and it was still a shocker to alot of people.

10965736,0,t3_5uto7m,Revisiting this topic to make a random comment the only thing that really makes me feel that way is that apparently she is the only one who can capture an akuma and magically undo all the bad shit.

11190081,0,t3_5ygxxy,One thing that I would like to point out to people is that the Peacock Miraculous doesnt have to be the Miraculous that Master Fu was referring to when he said he only made that mistake once. It has been confirmed in the Origins episode that there are Miraculouses outside of the ones we have already seen. Cervnossp?Hercules and Tomoe Gozen were shown in the opening scene and they clearly had deer lion and bird powers respectively. I bet that the mistake Master Fu made was with a Miraculous we have yet to see not with one we have already seen.,miraculousladybug,df0ds3r,4,t5_39tdz
