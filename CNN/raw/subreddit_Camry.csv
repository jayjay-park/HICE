8808481,0,t1_d76g9is,Good to know thanks.  The specs say that the Camry is marginally larger on the inside than my Passat so I will be quite interested to see if they hold true. ,Camry,d76nqw9,1,t5_2ue7h
9258987,0,t3_577d3z,If you get anything super fancy you will lose all your bass because your headunit doesnt have enough juice to drive aftermarket speakers. You could get some low wattage replacement speakers that will definitely sound better than your current stock speakers. But just dont go overboard if you dont plan on adding an amp as well.  ,Camry,d8pn6dj,1,t5_2ue7h

11095399,0,t3_5nmtrv,Had the same issue with mine blowing fuses non stop. I had some speaker wire laying around and just used that. I also took the opportunity to lengthen them slightly in hopes to avoid it happening again. Been  months now and its fine.,Camry,depnjni,1,t5_2ue7h
