3230074,0,t3_2x2bnz,Ive read it  or  times over the years and just finished the audio version.  Definitely one of my top  favorites.  Im reading Neuromancer for a nd time now and enjoying it for some reason I didnt get into it the first time.  Forever War is another very good scifi though not cyberpunk.,nealstephenson,cowswdj,1,t5_2se0g
