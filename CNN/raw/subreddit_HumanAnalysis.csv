9602758,0,t3_5bu81x,The US was founded with legal slavery legal genocide and has never recovered from it.Its that simple.We fought a civil war over it after  years.  The fear of Andrew Jackson as a military leader was the only thing preventing it after  years.  The reconstruction era ended with a hung presidential race similar to s in which southern states ceded the presidency in exchange for deoccupation and their quiet insurgency has not ended since.Furthermore racial segregation was not limited to the south.  When freed slaves moved north there were race riots in virtually every major northernmidwestern city followed by the segregation of those areas as well.When your countrys laws declare a man to be  of a man depending on his skin color and justifies the extermination of natives you tend to have long standing race relation problems.Trump voters actually think that he will keep his promises listen to them in interviews.  They have no idea that most of them are literally impossible to deliver upon.  The same tactics that drove southern insurgency after the civil war drives these people now.  They had a brief period of blue collar prosperity due to government spending post ww that they think they were solely responsible for due to the God given prosperity of the uneducated white man.  Nixon and Reagan sold them this to win elections that they otherwise could not win.  ,HumanAnalysis,d9wqip3,2,t5_3hfke

Just having a sub isnt going to attract people.So two or three people need to go google up a dozen or so good articles and post them once a day or a span of a week or two.  While thats going on you should ask other philosophycriticism type subs to give you a sidebar link.,HumanAnalysis,db2xhdu,7,t5_3hfke
