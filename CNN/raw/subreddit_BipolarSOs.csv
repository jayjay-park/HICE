322252,0,t1_cfe5y9r,No problem. Also I agree with what uTheLimitDNE said. And I do think you should try to help him recognize his actions as being his BP. Talk to him about doing that before his next episode and then do it gently and straight foreword. You could tell him that you think he might be having an episode and it would be best if you both let things calm down and if hes still upset about what he is upset about in the moment you can talk later about it when you are both calm and collected. Or something along those lines you know?And thank you for the compliment I hope youre right. ,BipolarSOs,cfe66x7,1,t5_2zww6

683260,0,t3_21zcea,Firstly Im letting you know that Im going to be brutally honest with you here. I may get down voted a lot for this and this may not be the response you want but from what Ive read its the response I think you need to hear.I am sorry you have had to endure this. I can imagine you feel confused hurt frustrated and used. You sound like a smart person with a big heart who likes to help people. So I must ask Have you ever met him in person? It is very easy to lie to someone online that youve never met physically I know because Ive done it. If you have not met him in person yet how likely is it that you ever will? If you cant see yourself physically meeting him in person then I would advise you to let him go as a lover. He needs help and being a partner to someone with a mental condition requires a lot of energy time and commitment. Im not saying youre incapable of that but if youre not physically around him are you going to be able to make sure he actually gets to his doctor appointments? What if he has medication prescribed to him and decides not to take it? With an entire relationship based on lies so far you can never be sure that hes honest with you about these things if youre on Skype.I know you said that you love him and this may not be the response you are wanting to hear but I think you should try to save yourself some heartache and just be friends with him. Your entire relationship so far has been online which is fine but there is no way to verify anything he has told you and he has lied to you multiple times. You are . Youre young and you have a whole amazing career ahead of you. I think you should take care of your heart and your own sanity first before you worry about his.Obviously you cant be expected to completely stop talking to this guy but you shouldnt drop everything to talk to him at a moments notice either. Be a friend to him listen to him when he needs someone to talk to but you arent his doctor. He needs to be getting help from his own therapist if he even sees one that burden should not be put on you.Again Im sorry youre feeling this way. I hope you are able to find peace in your life soon. Love amp light to you. lt,BipolarSOs,cghxrqf,6,t5_2zww6

Obviously you cant force your brother to be admitted into hospital or see a psychiatrist thats something he needs to do in his own time. But a professional in your area may be able to better advise you of the best steps to take to help your brother. Id also talk to your dad about the situation and see how aware he is of your brothers condition.It sounds very much like bipolar but I wonder if it could be borderline personality disorder?

3258637,0,t3_2xcy89,I dont want to be an alarmist but moving to another country to live with a bipolar I person is asking for a life of instability. If youre willing to experience the extreme turbulence and bipolar I guys generally experience the manic parts of bipolar more often than the depressive parts so the highs will be HIGH then sure go for it.  But youre looking at times when he is literally incapable and I mean literally of rational thought. He will be MENTALLY UNABLE to make decisions that make sense to a person who is rational.He will make decisions He steals something he sleeps with someone he tries to kill himself he assaults someone that you will never be able to understand. And honestly it might be so bad that he wont come back and then youre stuck in this country.You NEED to think    years in advance.  Are you willing to wait around while he spends  years in a long term facility because he went manic and literally assaulted someone?,BipolarSOs,cozroz0,2,t5_2zww6
3260066,0,t1_cozwnh3,I actually get that perfectly. Its difficult for me to talk about even because my husband and I had never been with anyone else when we got married. Were soul mates. But my mania hit and it was like... well it changed my personality completely. I cheated on him I saw stuff that wasnt there. I was paranoid I thought his family took a hit out on me. I vacillated so wildly that the friend I had an affair with... there could have been no doubt in his mind that I needed to be seen by professionals. He really took advantage of me but I wouldnt listen to anyone in my life.I actually ended up in the hospital...twice after a month of being so manic I wasnt sleeping at all. And my poor terrified love could only watch. He was the only person who was convinced something was seriously wrong with me. Mostly everyone else probably because of how hurtful my behavior was just shrugged and said Wow I never knew gdreamer was like that.Uhm so... okay... I guess I should reiterate that after  years we are back to normal. He will nag me about sleep and being too high which is totally PTSD for him. As for me I was just a normal mother of two who fell bassackward into the gene pool. Like a genetic predisposition to heart disease I drew the short straw and found myself in it one day. I would say with her... give all meds a month or so to really settle in. Also med adjustments are the hardest. If they give you the wrong med which could totally be a miracle cure for someone else its  weeks to see if its even working right and getting used to the side effects and  weeks to withdraw if she goes off it.And it is hell.I say mixed state... uh sorry Im trying to explain as best I can. OkIn your research you are going to read that most people with bipolar cycle every  months or so or more. It all seems to clean and clinical and cut and dry. In reality its not. I for example am an ultradian rapid cycler. I can cycle several times a day but on average I will stay manic for a week or two with some small down periods and then switch. To rapid cycle at all you switch  times in a year.The other oddity is a mixed episode where you display both symptoms of depression and mania in one. So with your SO the compulsivity and irritability but the depressed sex drive and classic depressed symptoms. I dont know if you guys will work out she will have to have a come to Jesus with herself but shes got to have about  months on good meds after a bad episode Id say  at least to come back to any kind of normal...Is this helpful? Is there anything else I can help you with?,BipolarSOs,cozx0xm,1,t5_2zww6

3476384,0,t3_2yi7st,Well the fun begins...We ran into one of my mother friends at the shops and that has triggered a massive argument.  My wife and mother dont get along and at the counselors advice I have kept some distance between them  it is less than ideal but it is kind of working.Anyway mothers friend made a comment that my wife interpreted as offensive and here we are.  She insisted that I confront anyone who approaches us and tell them not to talk to her.  I said I wasnt comfortable with that I really am not comfortable and Id have to think about it and get back to her.   days later due to take the daughter around to visit some relatives from over seas at mum and dads and she blows up I am not allowed to take my daughter to see them as punishment for mums friend comment.I hadnt got back to my wife with my response because I was really uncomfortable with what she asked and was trying to think of a way of saying no without triggering a fight.  Since we discussed the other day wife decided that it was better if I ask mum to ask her friends not to approach I am still not entirely comfortable with this approach but it is the better of two bad options however never told me  so I am in trouble for not answering the second demand even though I had never been told about it and I am still struggling to find a way to approach the first one.I talked to mum about the offensive comment and mum said she hasnt even seen that friend since the fight with my wife... but of course wife wont believe anything that comes from my mother.,BipolarSOs,cpoj7i9,1,t5_2zww6
3547398,0,t3_30satv,Although my SO and I didnt go through anything like what you have and we were together a significant amount of time prior to diagnosis it took him several years to find with his dr.s help the right combination of meds to even him out. From your account of what was going on with her lack of reality and altered perspective doesnt sound like she was getting the proper treatment or hadnt found the right combination. imho sounds like she wasnt in mental place to take her treatment seriously as you describe. One of the hardest parts of trying to understand mental illnesses is the limitations it can have on a person... what we perceive as flat out lying might just be their way of coping with all thats happening to them. I know I have to remind myself that my SO didnt asked for this didntdoesnt want it and sometimes even medicated cant control all the symptoms all the time. Whatever happens I hope you find the peace you are looking for and that she gets the help she needs. ,BipolarSOs,cpwmjnv,2,t5_2zww6
3633946,0,t3_31zr6a,Very tough situation to be in!!! A lot of what you said is happening currently in your relationship really resonated with me as very similar to what was going with my SO prior to diagnosis. He had all these business plans and ideas of what his life should or could be. Nearly all of it didnt include me. The part about Kernel of Truth really hit home with me. So many times I had thought oh well that is true.... so maybe its just me not seeing this that or the other thing At the time I really had no idea what was going other than he was making me miserable and I felt so alone. From the sounds of it you are very aware of whats going on and its good you are reaching out and getting help. I hope that the counselor recognizes the signs and that your SO gets the help she needs. I wish you the very best in this process! I am glad that you are staying grounded keeping your children top priority it will help to not get sucked into all the drama. ,BipolarSOs,cq6hwyq,1,t5_2zww6

You have no idea the pain her behaviour may be causing her family. Remaining friends can even have a real negative impact on her health as you leave a mania accelerant for her.

Now yes if the person with cancer refuses treatment its kind of on them that theyre having the symptoms in the first place however like bipolar disorder the sideeffects of the medication can sometimes be worse than the symptoms of the disorder.  Thats how it is with me.  Without medication I have a lack of impulse control and widely varying moods with medication Im a suicidalhomicidal dick.  To hold cheatinglying against the SO you have to believe they had a choice in the process.  Ive been there and no it doesnt work that way.  At no time during a manic high have I ever been capable of saying I shouldnt do this.  and if you believe your SO can youre holding them up to an impossible standard and are doomed to be disappointed.,BipolarSOs,crn1qlj,1,t5_2zww6

Unfortunately we are far too familiar with what the psych ward does and how quickly people are shuffled in and out others in our family have gone through it including myself but in our case that was actually what we were looking for as my husband wanted to go only if he could get in and out and back to work immediately. ,BipolarSOs,csk6yzv,2,t5_2zww6

4909219,0,t1_cudakj3,So many little things honestly. Big things too but the little things that happen every day are the things that whittle me down. Even when hes in a good mood I have to be on eggshells because I might ruin everything. Which he tells me constantly. Say hes flying high and I encourage him to temper his expectations in the hopes of avoiding the inevitable crash when things dont go his way the switch flips and I hear about how I ruined his dayhis mooddont support him even if Ive been incredibly supportive just more conservative than him. He has this tendency of rewriting history. He views me as his enemy  of the time. Hes CALLED me his enemy a number of times and it breaks my heart. In his head Im this person who is out to get him to tear him down to disagree with him to prove him wrong etc. He just makes me feel like Im a selfish person all the time. E.g. If he ever says lets watchdo  and I say okay he treats me with suspicion. Like I never ever do anything he wants to do. He acts like I hate everything so I have to keep a huge laundry list of all the times Ive loved the things he wants to do. If he ever cooks and I like what he eats he acts shocked and like I HATE his cooking and have never loved it. I have to have a list ready of every meal hes ever cooked that I enjoyed he doesnt cook often but Ive never hated anything hes cooked. Or if Im unobservant about something say passing a pedestrian in the street  and he remarks about them and I dont know who hes talking about hell say something like HAH youre always yelling at ME for being unobservant... I have to remind him that I have never said that and certainly never yelled at him for it...in fact he is the one who constantly says that to ME because I never pick up on conversations going in the background I tend to look ahead or down at the ground I dont look at the buildings and he always does etc and I have no idea wherehow it came into his head that Ive ever commented on his observational skills. ONE time I was put into a bad mood on a date because he was hitting on his coworker right in front of me and has a very long history of cheating in relationships and now hes rewritten history to complain that I always start fights when we go to do that particular activity. I have to list every time we HAVE done that particular date activity and it was fine before he realises hes exaggerating Im not this miserable crone that just exists to hate on his existence. He honestly believes his every exaggeration is reality unless I can prove it isnt. It creates this environment where I have to defend myself for the most...ludicrous things. He paints me as this really hateful negative person and most of the time I believe it.If I ever have an opinion that differs like if he is in love with a movie and I dont really care for it its a highly offensive thing. I HAVE to agree with him otherwise Im somehow devaluing his opinion saying his opinion is wrong etc. Even if I have literally said you can have your opinion and I can have mine its not good enough. We have had incredibly explosive hour long arguments over something as simple as a  minute film short because I wasnt in love with it the same way he was. He makes me feel like Im constantly in the wrong just for having an opinion that Im this terrible negative person who is only around to ruin his day.If he grows a hate boner for someone we knowone of our friends hell rant and rave then ask my opinion. Sometimes his complaints are legitimate and I voice my agreement. Sometimes its just because hes not in the limelight and theyre stealing his thunder or making him feel neglectedless important I work the hardest Im the best and Im not being rewarded why dont I get any of what they get theyre moronsidiotsincompetent etc It would be easier just to lie about how I feel but I cant...do that. I voice my opinion that I feel hes being harsh and then everything explodes. Im the enemy again Im defending them Im on their side Im undermining him invalidating his opinion if I dont agree it means hes wrong etc. Even if I repeat that he can have his opinion and I can have mine and thats okay. I HAVE to agree with him. He spits out these cruel things. I block most of them out but theyre there in my subconscious I think. It can take days but when he gets back into his sound state of mind he realises how cruel hes been and agrees that he was too harsh on our friends and he should calm down about it. The next day something new happens. A few times Ive successfully helped him reach a place of empathy so he understands our friends but most of the time I cant help him break that mental barrier where everything is the HIM show and were all just bit players designed to undermine him.I guess I dont know who I am anymore. If I rely on his perceptions Im a negative angry insensitive wet blanket that hates everything. I have to fight to remind myself Im not. I dont know what to believe anymore. I just know I dont have any confidence. I have to remind myself of how I used to be when I was in other relationships just so I can remember that Im a loving creative funny easy going nodrama person. ,BipolarSOs,cudcdy8,4,t5_2zww6

People get extremely judgy when one person is not working  ESPECIALLY if its the man yay societal standards. My parents love my boyfriends personality but despise the fact that Im financially supporting him. My father makes passive aggressive comments on a regular basis. At first I didnt say anything because I know that deep down it comes from a place of caring about his daughter but its gotten to the point where Ive boiled over and told him to knock it the fuck off. After years of explaining my mother is pretty supportive for the most part but I can just tell she hates it from her tone of voice. Friends dont understand unless theyve been through it themselves or with loved ones. When I meet new people and they ask what my SO does I actually lie and say he works from home because its just so much easier than getting the third degree about why my boyfriend doesnt have a job. I feel terrible for lying but I just cant deal with the judgment sometimes. It keeps people off my back and makes my life easier.

7162565,0,t1_d1s0r7t,Im sorry to be the one to have to say this but every time you say it doesnt make  sense you reject his experience and draw a wall around yourself that says only people with your sense experience have a valid point of view.  His actions make perfect sense to him and even a bit of sense to me as someone whos struggled with depression in the past.  For some it might sound immature for a grown man to let everything hinge on whether or not he can play in the snow but for him it represented something fundamental.  He saw life in that small activity where all around him he felt death.  There was a glimmer of hope that for a moment he might feel young and carefree  escape his tormenting thoughts and experience the happiness of childhood again and hes angry at you because your rejection condemned him to an evening of still more negative thoughts.  So to you it was irrational but to  him in that moment it meant escaping depressions icy grip.  Im not saying you have to drop what youre doing every time he has a manic episode just that there is a logic to it if you understand his reality.  By saying it doesnt make sense youre not just rejecting his experience youre verbalizing out loud that you dont think its even worth considering what his reality is like.  From that point of view splitting up seems rational not because he doesnt like you but because hes feeling a strong disconnect which might go very deep with you such that you reject the fundamental essence of his condition.,BipolarSOs,d1sbch4,0,t5_2zww6

It is clear that these meds are not working not right for him so he decided a few days ago to quit the meds. I am working to get him to a different doctor but I have been quite unsuccessful in that. Honestly thought things were better before the meds but he was experiencing more suicidal thoughts. I know I cant make him be proactive Im not sure what to do,BipolarSOs,d7j78xo,1,t5_2zww6
9147587,0,t1_d8b6rxj,But when they are bipolar arent they the same person manic or depressed just amplified happy or amplified sad?  Something about him had to be real regarding his personality right?  Otherwise how can they ever love someone else without some of the core of them being there at all times?  I am so confused ,BipolarSOs,d8biuhb,1,t5_2zww6
9152989,0,t1_d8c3r0v,It is bad to be dependent on each other to this extent.The rest of this is probably best discussed with your therapist.,BipolarSOs,d8c7h92,1,t5_2zww6
9213190,0,t1_d8dxxxc,I dont really see how she made it all about herself shes describing the journey she went with her bipolar husband to find his birth mother.,BipolarSOs,d8ju99i,1,t5_2zww6
9219826,0,t1_d8juaoq,Thanks much for the well wishes. Its been neat to learn so much that we assumed was lost to time and circumstance.  I still worry that the whole experience might somehow trigger him in one way or another but thats just life.  So far hes still excited and happy to have found a missing piece of himself. ,BipolarSOs,d8koi8h,1,t5_2zww6
9298205,0,t3_57sb9w,Making the therapist appt was an amazing move. Taking care of yourself is paramount.I can feel where youre coming from especially in regards to the enabling friends. My exSO has been in a hypomanic episode for a few months now. Shes frozen me out has been hanging out exclusively with people who are encouraging some reckless behavior. I think the big takeaway is that you cannot control him. Hes an adult and has to make his own decisions and abide by the consequences of those decisions. I know that thats a hard pill to swallow. Im still struggling with it. I cant speak for your situation but any attempt to help or talk things out from my end is being immediately shot down and pushes her in opposite direction out of spite.It sucks.  It sucks so bad and Im so sorry youre going through this. Please if you can rely on friends to help you out. If not message me. Im in rough shape right now but Ill do what I can. Maybe others here can do the same.  Take days in minutes or hours at a time if you need to. Avoid dwelling on the future its unknown and will crush you with uncertainty. Most importantly is to take care of yourself. You deserve it.  You need it. ,BipolarSOs,d8um4bs,1,t5_2zww6
9368173,0,t3_58uy2o,Well Ive been in his shoes. Cheated on beat down mentally amp physically.... taken for granted etc. Its tough to chalk things up to the disease. Its tough to get past the actions and words. Sadly she currently is in a stage of mania and she has ghosted me. It seems like things have clicked for you though. Seems like you are more than willing to better yals situation. I personally am hoping that when she comes back this time that things will be different. That she will be willing to go to counseling and get medicated. Maybe put in that effort to make things better. Hes at a low point. At least I look at it that way. When she is depressed Ill pick up the slack to keep things going. I always strive to be the bigger person. One day I hope we are both on the same page and we work together efficiently. Couples counseling sounds like a great start an excellent place to communicate with a third person mediating. I do wish you luck I hope for all the best for your family. This post has given me hope that my SO will one day be ready to have a healthy relationship.,BipolarSOs,d93he50,2,t5_2zww6

9925157,0,t3_5hg9ek,my SO has called me a sheep because im a follower according to him?? and i honestly find it so funny. in the moment it hurts but after it just seems so stupid and ridiculous. I dont joke about it with any of my friends because im too embarrassed but i can relate,BipolarSOs,db19twe,2,t5_2zww6
10200175,0,t3_5m1vcs,Im the bipolar one in my relationship so my husband sometimes gets to be on the receiving end of this sort of thing. Im generally easy going and friendly but in a mood shift I can get really irritable and snappy especially when Im not having to fake being normal for people I dont know well. My personal experience is that reminding me of the worst parts of my mom so I do what I can to shut that down. But in a mood shift that horrible stuff is all my brain is letting me come up with. Which horrifies me and makes me feel worse about myself.  I feel like my nerves are all barbed wire. Its a bad state to be in. On top of that my husband isnt magically doing what I want him to do which makes me want to yell at him. So far Ive managed to keep that part on lock down but I know it would crush him if it slipped out.I cant speak for your boyfriend but I truly love my husband. I know its hard on him especially this time of year December has been getting harder and harder for me no idea why. My husband is really good at accidentally saying something the exact wrong way to crumble my world.Again I cannot say this is what your boyfriend is experiencing but the negative thoughts I mentioned that my husband ends up involved in are the bipolar not how I normally feel. With the irritated state my mind just chews on every annoyance. I can keep the mental defenses up for a while but I do have breaking points. Left to my own devices in this state I might be able to get through the phase without melting down or burning my toast will destroy me its hard to say. Bring in the person who knows me the best and is completely woven into my life the amount of activity increases especially actions out of my control and so the odds of something getting through my mental wall increases.gt I wish I knew how he honestly felt about me sometimes.How long have you been with him? How old are you guys? Im in my early s and have been with my husband for well over  years. We know each other really well so hes more able to separate out my normal behavior from the mood shifted but it can still be muddy for him. Ive gotten a better perspective on the bipolar with age and have gotten able to sometimes separate myself from the severe mood shift but this has only been in the past couple of years. The best way to find out is to ask him when hes in a good mental place. Ask him what he was thinking or going through in the incident you described. Let him know what you experienced and what you felt. See if you can find some strategies for how to approach these sorts of things in the future for both of you. ,BipolarSOs,dc08w8b,7,t5_2zww6
10265658,0,t3_5mzysp,I think its like... A little of column A a little of column B. Yes its hard as fuck to fight the urges of doing reckless things but youre also making excuses for her.In my relationship we just decided to open it it just works for us. But obviously that doesnt work for everyone nor would I recommend it to most couples especially where one is bipolar.Get tested take some time for yourself OP. Do you think you might be able to get past something like this? Is your partner seeing doctors taking medication? If not to both questions... Jump ship. It hurts like a motherfucker but you definitely dont want to be swallowed by this shit.,BipolarSOs,dc7o2j9,5,t5_2zww6
10285098,0,t3_5n95dq,First the cheating has to stop.  Once its stopped and you have moved past it maybe he can find an alternative outlet.  Have you considered role play? Maybe you both can enjoy these activities together but in the comfort of your own home?  With costumes masks and wigs you are really only limited by imagination.,BipolarSOs,dc9vf6d,2,t5_2zww6
10296899,0,t3_5n1amt,Now he is still flirting with the girl he works with as I noticed on his facebook. He promised me everything he said was true yesterday he said he was sleeping with her and he doesnt know why. Hes continuing now though. I know were not together but it hurts feeling like i never existed.,BipolarSOs,dcb7jnm,1,t5_2zww6
10361841,0,t1_dcijmua,What makes you think hes not coming back? Im curious because after talking about visiting my ex ? this month at first he said maybe in Feb but atm I am being ghosted. Im wondering if he just doesnt want any company or if he doesnt want me. Even though he said he liked me.,BipolarSOs,dcikqln,2,t5_2zww6
10367195,0,t3_5ogftr,Truthfully if you were being physically and mentally abused... Im not sure going back is a good idea even if he has a grip on it. Im the one with bipolar disorder and Im lucky enough to do really well with meds. But that doesnt mean things dont come up and there are plenty of people who still experience issues while on meds. If your safety is dependent on him taking his medicine thats unfair. Im sure you do love and miss him but if the idea of going back has you scared hesitant and considering your personal safety... Then Im not sure its the best decision. Please take care of yourself above all else your body and mental stability are far more important. I hope that doesnt sound cold in any way.,BipolarSOs,dcj6mly,7,t5_2zww6
10486514,0,t3_5nz3mm,Im not at my last straw but being told shes done and unhappy etc and then  minutes later discussing our wedding plans hurts me every damn time.  times now I guess Im a glutton for punishment.,BipolarSOs,dcwr7nz,1,t5_2zww6
10486624,0,t3_5q66zh,I know its hard but just give it a little time.  He has had two major things change the chemical makeup in his brain stopped weed changed meds.  This is a lot to adjust to.Tell him what you are feeling though.  He has a right to know that the way he is responding to the adjustment is having an  adverse impact on you.  Its better if you both go thru it together and fully aware of each others feelings.,BipolarSOs,dcwrnvz,5,t5_2zww6
10645580,0,t1_dde078l,Yes Ive informed mine that the door is always open if he changes his mind and Ive not contacted him since.I am not really interested in other men and I just got this new job so I will just be married to my work. ,BipolarSOs,dde0d47,2,t5_2zww6
