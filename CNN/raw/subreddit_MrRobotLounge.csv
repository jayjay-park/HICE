8815356,0,t3_50tw0p,What I found interesting is that when Darlene was questioning Elliot if he really is going to do this... speak to their mother and he says he has to she says we really need to talk and then adds shits gone down. I think the important part of that was that they need to talk why would she say that about him wanting to speak to histheir mom? Its really weird. There is something more to all this of course. sorry Im rewatching the ep just as this came up lol,MrRobotLounge,d77hi47,2,t5_3g3er

8849182,0,t3_51efv9,First please do not take what Whiterose said out of context which is what you did. Did she say those exact words God says there are no accidents. ? No she did not.She corrected her assistant when he said that the plane that the CEO was on was in an accident. WR simply said you know how I feel about that word. Then the assistant changed the word to crash. An accident does imply that the CEOs death was random or unintentional. WR is proud that she killed him and wants to correct the record with her assistant. That the CEOs death wasnt an accident it was an intentional crash.  SECrazy Elliots mom does indeed yell God says there are no accidents!  SE  I think the show has implied to some degrees that she was a rather religious woman I could be wrong about that  there isnt much info about her character to go on. She doesnt strike me as someone thats referring to AI when using the word god. She probably was a religious woman. Edward most likely was not. ,MrRobotLounge,d7bjnxw,2,t5_3g3er

8998791,0,t1_d7t1sdh,Hmm I meant it appeared more like Scientologys auditing process iirc Angela could not see the images on the screen. Although clearly the modern version of the cave imagery machine metaphor is images on a computer display.,MrRobotLounge,d7tik2n,2,t5_3g3er
