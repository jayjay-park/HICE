43264,0,t1_cejckju,There will be no comparison between your old x and your new one. For roughing I like a  to  grit belt. A  or  belt will leave a nice finish smoother than most files will. Finer belts can be run slower to avoid burning the steel.,Bladesmith,cejcuws,2,t5_2u8ql

739428,0,t3_22mmwo,This is a very interestingly designed bladed item. It looks like a type of sicle or hand scythe on first glance but the blade isnt offset from the handle like those usually are. With the different protrusions it could be some type of hunga munga or hurlbat native multibladed throwing weapons but it looks like the only sharp edge is the main cutting edge and for either of those all protrusions would be sharp. The cut outs holes in the blade look too perfect to not be machine cut making me think this is much more modern but then the handle being boneivory makes me think its not a standardized tool of any kind.Ive been collecting knives all my life and was born and raised on a farm. Ive never seen anything exactly like this. My best guess is this is some kind of fantasy style knife they do random cutouts and blade shapes all the time to look cool. It could also be that someone took a modern cut piece of metal lawn mower blade or some such thing and made it into a cutting tool to serve a particular purpose or they were just trying there hand at some custom blade smithing.

999287,0,t1_chhu5pa,Thats always the fear at that point.  The most common problem I ran into early on was warping.  The solution was to normalize which is to take the blade up to a dull cherry and then let it air cool back to black.  Do it twice before going up to critical and oil quenching.  If it still warps a little dont despair it can usually be straightened by clamping the blade flat during temper.  Keep in mind that you are going to have a lot of decarb and cleanup to do after quenching so dont go too crazy on the finish beforehand.,Bladesmith,chhvkg8,2,t5_2u8ql

I generally use brass inserts and oversized holes to add lateral strength and to make the tapping go a lot easier.Its also possible to do all of your fit up before heat treat and then be very careful with the epoxyfit up.

Well two people means a striker... so long story short weve become addicted to sticking whatever we can together in the forge.  This was some used chainsaw chain we got from a landscaper whos lawnmower blades we sharpen.  Made a big  bar of it which got divvied up into different projects but a few cutoffs ended up in the scrap bin... figured Id do something with them instead.Now I am a big against using mystery steel when possible but I thought this stuff just looked too cool to pass.  Since Im not sure of the carbon content the current plan is to make some San Mai with the stuff and a known high carbon core to take the mystery out of it...

I dont really have space for a bandsaw at this point and I would like to make knives in batches so I have had them water jet cut. I did the design of the profile myself for all of the blades. Factor in the cost associated with it though it can and  or so to each blade if you plan on selling them.Even when you water jet its not like its machine perfect. There is usually a slight angle to the edge you have to square up clean up holes and of course you are still grinding in the bevel and sanding the flats by hand more than likely. Youre only saving the time it takes to profile the blade with a bandsaw or by hand with a hacksaw or cutoff wheel and drill some holes.,Bladesmith,cox4e7v,3,t5_2u8ql

It would be nice with options for the customer that wants this I think. If the knife is used as a knife it will never get near the breaking point. Even the   hrc blades I made could take getting dropped on concrete and steel. I did experiment with a super thin edge on those for woodworking though and had some chipping. Maybe theyll do good with a more normal edge maybe those at  will be better. Im going to try it out until I find what I think is the sweet spot.,Bladesmith,cq5nu6i,1,t5_2u8ql

4047762,0,t1_crhn6yj,I guess I need to go all Bill Nye after all. The purpose of heat treating is to change the steels crystalline structure from one form to another. Annealed steels structure is named pearlite its extremely soft and workable. Above a certain temperature depending on the carbon content of the steel that pearlite will change into austenite an extremely hard but extremely brittle form of steel and depending on the carbon content of the steel it can go through multiple phases between pearlite and austenite.  Note that these arent different elements or anything these are just different crystal structures that steel can take.With O having a carbon content of . you can see from the phase diagram that at C O steel will become entirely austenite with a brief phase change between pearlite and austenite where instead the steel consists of austenite cementite and ledeburite. You are right when you say that overheating can be a problem but not when you quench it. The reason overheating can be a problem is because it will leech the carbon out of the steel which is bad obviously. It also causes the austenite crystals to merge making it more brittle. What I said earlier wasnt exactly clear about this but try to keep the steel from being white yellow or anything but applered. You have a margin of error of about C so dont worry too much. Take the torch of and on to maintain temperature for  minutes if it starts sparking let it cool until it stops or quench immediately that means you waaay overheated it.,Bladesmith,crhochw,2,t5_2u8ql

4632461,0,t1_ctef2oc,for a forged blade be sure to normalize prequench.a stock removal blade will similarly benefit in that regard though that heating serves as a stress reliever and less of a normalisation cycle.moving side to side is harmful because it causes one side to be cooled sooner than the other. Apart from those preventative measures perhaps the best way to stop warp is to just adjust the blade soon after quench. when its still hot enough that you have to use gloves you can tweak out any bends with your hands and when it cools it should set that way,Bladesmith,ctehov6,3,t5_2u8ql

5549999,0,t3_3r2z92,Step  could be modified to a simple air cool normalizing cycle. It certainly doesnt really need a full anneal before hardening.The purpose of tempering is to transform martensite into tempered martensite resulting in a reduction of the brittleness of pure martensite and usually a drop in overall hardness.Depending on how youve worked the steel to this point it should be wildly below the hardness of a quenched blade. annealed tool steel can be around RC. putting it in an oven at C will do literally nothing to it. same if it was at rc rc or rc.Without quenching you are trying to modify a formation in the steel that simply doesnt exist.Mind you none of this is really all that important when dealing with railroad spikes. the steel is not good enough to really fine tune the performance.,Bladesmith,cwl11ra,4,t5_2u8ql
5568032,0,t1_cwn8oy7,the short answer heat retention and generation. the simplest form of a coffee can forge ive seen is just a plaster of paris and sand mixture that will work for a few times or in a pinch but it will crack and crumble and fall apart pretty quickly. and you have just that thin layer of metal on the outside which will break down too that coupled with the plastersand is a poor insulator and will require a lot of fuel to get necessary heat and sustain it  which only causes it to breakdown faster. there are better things to use in such a set up but it only marginally increases performance and longevity. whereas a soft fire brick is just about the best insulator there is its fragile but it will retain heat much better and breakdown far slower. it holds heat inside the forge chamber rather than it absorbing through the materials of the forge itself. its more efficient and you can have greater control of overall temperatures.a better vessel and insulation is only going to make the unit better at its job a thicker steel container around your firebrick is ideal. but for the small blanks and such that you are likely to be using in it just the brick can suffice.,Bladesmith,cwn9k73,2,t5_2u8ql

Use sand paper strapped on to a hard piece of wood to keep everything straight and in line. I like the design. I like it much more when you reveal the pattern than let the forge and heat treat structure stay. Remember that the heat treat may warp the blade.

Remember though that the eutectoid point for carbon in steel is about . so anything more than that will likely act as a carbide former and make iron carbides and give abrasion resistance. Since O has other carbide formers as well the effect on overall abrasion resistance is PROBABLY negligible in this case. Thats just from my own understanding of how steel works though which is by no means a professional opinion.This does underscore the importance of getting steel from known sources though.

6935488,0,t3_4amvht,Ill share one since maybe some of you can avoid making the same mistake. Like many shops mine is used for some storage a well as being a shop. I was working in the predawn hours hot summer had to get an order done forging during the day was not an option and was about to wrap up forging and head to work when a weld on a Damascus billet opened up. Ok so I had to fix that and as I was waiting for it to come back up to heat to reweld I noticed light coming from the wrong side of the shop to be the sunrise....It was a fire. But it was all the way across the shop from the forge x building so it was a ways away. After filling the shop with yellow dust from a big ABC extinguisher I discovered what had happened. I had been grinding a billet with an angle grinder to restack and some sparks had flown across the shop and settled in a moving blanket. The kicker was that I hadnt been running the angle grinder for  minutes when the smoldering finally became flames. If I hadnt been fixing a bad weld I would have been in the shower getting ready for work and the shop would have been a complete loss.TLDR Almost burned down my shop with an angle grinder  minutes after I was done grinding.,Bladesmith,d12gq7u,1,t5_2u8ql

7782587,0,t3_4l979q,Many woods  especially less dense ones  may absorb water or other fluid. If you seal them consider the sealant. Some sealants are not considered foodsafe and may be toxic. Hopefully youre not eating the handle but handle gets on hands hands get on corn corn goes in face.If you do not seal them the wood may swellcontract over time leading to cracking. The nature of construction also impacts this pins rivets screws epoxy different wood expansion rates etcExpect that the knife will be quickly abused during usage especially if the users or their guests are not knife fanatics. If they are slamming the knife fairly hard into a ceramic plate honing will not be enough. As mentioned earlier serrations help with this. I encourage you to experiment with a cheap knife sharpen it press into a plate with increasing force and take note of the reaction. A lower hardness steel will fold over quickly. A higher hardness steel may even chip out. IMO  is kinda thick. Some people expect a sturdy steak knife  which it would be. Some people expect it to flex  for which you would want thinner.If you go thinner you may want to grind the bevel AFTER heat treat. If you grind it in before you increase the risk of warping the blade.,Bladesmith,d3qtd2a,1,t5_2u8ql

Not sure if that is the correct way but it works for me. ,Bladesmith,d60wmbx,4,t5_2u8ql

So with that in mind I can imagine that if you are going to whack at it all day to bang it into shape that annealing will make the job a lot easier.

I dont think they should be able to post if they are not active in this sub in one way or another. We would just get a bunch of posts that they are posting on any site they think they can make a sale. Dont see a problem with posting links offsite. Most will probably have a site setup where to purchase from. Title that states what it is. Brief Description and price. No auction type sales. PicMore in depth description if needed and how to buy.  item for sale per post unless the items are the same but a little different.  maple scales that are the same size but dyed different colors etc.  or  reposts at most. Allowed items. Finished knives and anything related to knifemaking. Not sure how you could provide buyer protection or if you should even try on a format such as this. Offsite sales between the  parties would be easiest for mods as that takes them out of the sale.  strike rule? Who is going to judge which party is in the wrong?There are bad sellers and bad buyers.

10304116,0,t3_5njzpd,Finished these two last night first time with Hitachi white . These started as the prelaminated .xxmm bars from Dictum mild sides with white  core. Got both of these from one mm long bar. The big one is about  of blade the small one . Walnut and black linen micarta handles in danish oil. Need to work on my estimating while forging the tang and such I could have gotten two  knives if I were better with estimating where to start the tang. I also need to force myself to get them thinner yet these are both about .mm thick at the back of the spine would have been happier with .mm. I got some pure white  as well to make my own sanmai with for bigger blades.Water quenching them was nerve racking but it turned out great followed the recipe that came with the steel F austenitizing temp quench in warm water and tempered at F for about hrc. They took an awesome sharp edge didnt have to fight it to get the edge either both easily shave of course.Im actually quite happy with these two not sure if the sizes are going to prove useful but I was mostly just experimenting with the white  and was happily surprised to end up with a pair of very nice blades will probably gift them to familyfriends!What do you all think?,Bladesmith,dcc0z7u,1,t5_2u8ql

11027509,0,t3_5xdb6u,Ive gotten the same request to make an ESEE izula clone I didnt do it.  If someone copied my style directly and posted it for sale on blade forums or some other venue I would be pretty annoyed.  If it was a commission that was never publicly for sale Id care less but if Im honest about it Id probably still be bothered to some extent should I see it.  It kind of depends on what your copying.  Although I have seen some other examples of a similar style I would never make a handle that looked like Don Nguyens I feel like he owns that style now. Within the realm of traditional japanese cutlery everything is a clone of everything because in that tradition its all about execution not originality.  There are a few very common knife patterns like some loveless designs or the aaron gough resolute that have almost become genericized in a similar way.  In Aarons case Id say thats largely due to the effort he has put into creating instructional information for beginner knife makers and that the resolute is a very simple and practical design.  So he kind of embraced no idea if it was intentional being copied to spread his brand which I think is great and hes helped out a ton of people along the way get into doing something they love.  So in answer to your question Id say if its a fairly common or generic knife style youre probably safe.  If its something very recognizable as someones unique design or style I would try to at least tweak it to make it yours or not do it at all.,Bladesmith,dehxyq8,2,t5_2u8ql

11527689,0,t3_64jrr0,Im not master smith but I do a lot of salvage pieces and I have found that some springs especially the very old ones have cracks in them to begin with. Im guessing its because they are stressed so much in their normal use. They develop micro cracks then the hammering makes it worse. Try cleaning off a piece that is unhammered and stick it in some etching fluid. It will show you just how many cracks are in there. As to the handle cooling I do that from time to time but only on longer blades and I NEVER let the handle get fully red. In fact once it starts getting to hot to hold I will dunk it.

Started storing my wood in a dryer place  in a bucket with some sawdust and it does wonders. Havent had a single issue since. Give that a shot! If that doesnt work you may have some finicky wood.
