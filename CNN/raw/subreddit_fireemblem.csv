In the Sacred Stones I have a file that has a lot of gold but mainly due to grinding through the ruins on the creature campaign. On my current run though I have about g... In Binding Blade even with the silver card and copious arena use I only have g on chapter . In Rekka no Ken I ended up with close to g and maxed storage somehow I think a lot of it came from the stocking up side quest though.I think I spend a lot of my money buying huge amounts of iron weapons in the GBA games because I refuse to use anything better than steel unless Im on the last few chapters.,fireemblem,ceexsq6,2,t5_2t0cn

767419,0,t3_22y057,Wow Ive got a lot to update but I forget a lot.Chapter  Wendy Barth and Oujay died valiantly as weaponless human walls.  Marcus and Zealot carry as usual.  I dont kill off Cath cause Im so humanitarian and totally value units lives.  Astol helps.Chapter x Mostly training Astol Chad and Roy. Bla bla bla Durandal cant use this yet.Chapter  SHIN ACQUIRED.  And damn he levels fast.  Really helps out.  I take the Aroute.  Fir lives because of the free Karel access and no Bartre.Chapter A I dont have any axe users besides my two paladin buddies.  I dont recruit Gonzales or save the village because Im the best ever.  Shin keeps leveling and I keep running out of bows and swords.Chapter A ECHINDA LALUM AND TATE.  Unfortunately it goes a lot slowerpaced than my normal runs.  This is the first time I saw the midboss that shows up after a certain amount of turns.  It confused me at first.  Saul reaches level  here but I forgot to bring promotion items.  Shin reaches level  told you he leveled quickly! and promotes.  All  arena levels go to Tate.  I dont get any of the promotion items because Im a great tactician not like Id need them for anything but funds.Chapter  I totally forget about reinforcements and have to haul ass to beat the chapter before Chad gets it.  Promoted Saul starts to work on his light magic rank Im looking at you Aureola and base D rank.  Cath finally gets recruited here.  I just skip over Ray because Im too lazy to bring Chad up and he doesnt aggro so I wont hurt him.Chapter x  I always get fooled that theres amazing treasure here.  But its just antitoxins and elixirs and a gem.  Tate Echidna and Cath get a bulk of the experience here.  Armads acquired.Chapter   Tate promotes I get a glimpse of my man Percy but dont get to him yet why would I want to? he doesnt get his bonuses yet.  All  arena levels go to Cath.  Once again Marcus and Zealot are my main walls but at this point theyre good at weakening for Echidna Tate and Shin.  Als Sword and Body Ring both go to Echidna.Chapter  Sucked as usual.  But I managed to get all the treasures and the Gaiden.  Some time beforehand Marcus got rank S in axes E to S? I dont know either so Armads helped clear out dragon lords and a stubborn manakete.  I dont bother with the bandits.Chapter x Long range magic sucks.  Disappearing floors suck.  Tate doesnt suck.In the middle of Chapter  will post stats when Im finished.  The chapter where I get a bandit and a god.EDIT Heres the stats   Gonna have to dedicate Speedwings and Secret Books to Garret to keep him up.Supports  MarcusRoy B  RoyLalum A  LalumEchidna B  TateZealot A  Planned Supports  CathGarret ACathChad B  Also Hughs death was pretty sadistically hilarious.

918591,0,t3_24n0x3,Heres an album I put together of chapter  which shows my basic strategy as well as my units after that chapter. Not much strategy here the only problems I had was when Joshua had to dodge  knight attacks in a row but it only took a couple of restarts for that to happen. Unfortunately Kyle and Forde died because I completely forgot about them but theyre not that important to me anyways.Now onto my units. Eirika has really poor strength but awesome defence. I think Ive had about  strength level ups since the start and it means she just cant do any damage to some things. Artur is an offensive powerhouse but is very squishy and the fact he kills most things that come  his way in one go means that he has to deal with several enemies in one turn and he cant dodge tank like Joshua. Ill probably make him mainly a healer once he promotes. Speaking of Joshua hes not doing anything particularly exciting except nearly capping speed at level . Nice. My star unit though so far is Neimi I love her. She has got some nice strength and speed growths which means that she is often the one doing the killing though from behind the other units. The day after the last post I attempted Chapter  several times and failed. It looks like Amelia is going to be hard to train probably just gonna pump her full of stat boosters dont even get me started on Ewan. However I have to be honest and say I have forgotten to play Fire emblem for the last few days which probably doesnt help as Im behind.

1043240,0,t1_chmr9ha,For me personally its also about comfort. Playing on a portable allows you so much more freedom. The game is standardized to the same device and display and you dont get weird displaysound when playing the game. Compared to playing on a console where I usually have to sit down and then play the game I can be more comfortable with a handheld. I can play it lying down on my bed I can play it in the bathroom on the bus or train to workschool. Its easier because a handheld device is so much more accessible where you can pull it out and use it almost anywhere. I enjoyed FE  and  but I feel like Fire Emblem is best played on handheld because of how long certain battles may take. ,fireemblem,chmvd5z,1,t5_2t0cn

In Fire Emblem specifically If you only ever engage near groups of enemies that you know you either have a  chance to kill or you know cant kill you in one fightenemy turn you wont lose any units. If you have the chance to get unlucky its because you didnt plan for the worst possible rolls by having a retreathealerreplacement frontliners. Even if you do screw up you should only ever have to lose one maybe worst case two units but never your lord. If you fail a playthrough by letting your lord die theres no amount of bad luck you can blame for that. Just dont put them at risk its not that hard to check every enemys movement range and stats.In terms of other games it varies gametogame.

1490095,0,t1_cj2z0qf,Well I dunno how anyone else would like it but heres a shot. Also titles are more placeholders I just am not good at thinking them up.Xenologue  Genesis of LossI think the first one would be oh happy fun cute time with MorganMUwifeoptional then bandits attack and they defend against them. Alternate Morgan slips during the battle and disappears. The bandits retreat from the combined force of the Shepherds and Alternate Morgans parents then they meet the army and the mandatory omg that avatar is me and main MU goes thats what Ill look like in  years?! moments get out of the way and whatever. Alternate MU discovers that his child is gone then she and the spouse have a really sad moment and resolve to track the Risen to the stronghold of the person controlling them.Xenologue  Fight!I dont have much for this Alternate MU and spouse find The Stronghold insert fittingly ominous name here and are joined by Grown Up Lucina and Spouse who have decided to help out Alternate MU for him helping to save the kingdom from Grima although its revealed that Chrom is the one who landed the last blow. Im not quite sure if this fits in with Awakening lore but it should. They fight through The Stronghold with several breaks for Alternate MU and Spouse to be Im worried etc. The Stronghold is also filled with traps like the  HP spikes fire pillars poison pillars etc. etc. When the last door is opened it reveals effectively a boss gauntlet a la FE All of the Major bosses except Validar and Gangrel are there superbuffed all stats in the high s great weaponskill loadouts. End cutscene resolve is strengthened etc. Main Morgan has a quick cutscene frowning to herself with closed eyes with ... after Alternate MU leaves.Xenologue  RequiemAlternate MU and co reach the top floor of The Stronghold to Validar standing with a large unidentified black spike and Alternate Emmeryns body its revealed he took it back to Plegia and had it perfectly preserved with magic same appearance as Main Emmeryn. After a bit of monologuing where hes shocked you discovered his plan despite the protagonists protestations that they were just looking for Morgan he says it doesnt matter as he takes the spike and impales Emm with it. Its revealed that small pieces of Grima are scattered in this Outrealm as a side effect of just being sealed but with enough of his residual evil it has the power to possess corpsespeople and reanimate corpses NOT BRING BACK TO LIFE there is a difference at least in this case them Validar picked Emms body for shock value whatever. Lots of shockedhorrified reaction from friends and all. Cue boss fight Instead of being on his back youre fighting Grimas head and fighting emmeryn its all super hard like  increase over Lunatic stats maybe with PavGis if its not too hard and after you wipe Grima Validar comes out all mad and whatnot. After a bit of ranting with Validar professing ignorance about Alternate Morgans disappearance and attempting to blast people an anticlimactic fight with Validar takes place. After he dies Grima finishes breaking up and a bright light goes through the room knocking everyone on their feet. Main Morgan at this point goes DADDY! IM SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU AGAIN! and hugs Alternate MU party time commences. Another heartbreak occurs as Morgan says that she has to go as Grima is threatening Main Chroms world Alternate MU and Spouse say how happy they are to have seen her again and that theyd look for himher at the top of that Stronghold from then on and she agrees to see them there. Partings take place.Cue end scene. Main MU walks up to Morgan and says ...you didnt get separated in a battle did you? Morgan refuses to answer and Main MU leaves after saying ...Im sorry Morgan. Morgan just goes ... and fade to black. This is also supposed to give the player a Fridge Horror moment where they realise even after the pieces of Grima are rounded updestroyed the Alternate MU and Spouse will go back to that spot year after year never seeing their child ever again and double that moment when the realise the same will happen to Main Morgans parentsAlternate end Assuming you didnt bring Morgan with you to the final chapter just utter heartbreak from the Alternate MU and Spouse about their last child but happiness at having stopped Validar mixed with firm resolve that theyd have to go out and round up pieces of Grima and destroy them.After writing this out I realise its probably not great but I get the feeling its more of a failure on my end to properly communicate it. PEDIT TLDR Morgans parents are right fucked if they want a real chance of seeing himher ever again.EDIT  OH GOD I LINKED TO THE WRONG TVTROPES PAGE WHAT DID I DO I JUST REALIZED THIS AS I GO TO THE FRIDGE TO GET MORE TEA THE HORROR,fireemblem,cj323z7,1,t5_2t0cn

Even before promotion he is a very good unit. But the rest of Alms party is not very good. His only flyer is crap many of his units are just generally not good and his party doesnt get that much good equipment. Celica may not be quite as strong as Alm but she is one of the best units in the game. She can use offensive and healing magic as well as swords which puts her ahead of most other units. She also has terrific stats. In addition to her there are the whitewings who are some of the best units in the game. They have terrific stats and can perform the triangle attack which is one of the strongest skills in the game. She also gets many terrific mages who promote to Priest same as Celica or Sage get renewal skill and many good melee units. Her party also has early access to the angel ring an item which doubles stat growths not growth rates growths. Gain  points not .

I cant say for sure but one that is fresh on my mind that really annoys me is chapter  in Awakening the one right after Emm dies. That chapter is so cheesy and stupid. It forces the emotion down your throat the rain the grey bleak map the music the sympathetic boss. Its like the game is screaming at you Be sad now! Which they kinda have to do since they gave me no real reason to be upset about Emms death. They tell you all about how great she is but never actually show her do anything. Compare that with Greil who is actually a main character for the beginning of the game not some girl you have seen like  times.

1668435,0,t1_cjovw8h,Im glad you liked it. Since you liked it so much I wrote something else. I tried to make this a support conversation but it was tough so I decided to make it a short story. Your convo between Matthew and Nino inspired to make my own take on the two so heres one for you ucschollen  I hope you like it. This story was also heavily inspired by a scene I saw in the game Lost Odyssey long ago. So its like Odyssey but with Matthew and Nino plugged in. Enjoy!Ninos DepartureThe inns door opens as the moonlight slips its way past the entrants figure. Matthew the thief has travelled a far road to reach the small rustic inn for he is here to visit a girl who is very dear to him. He looks to the innkeeper standing in the room and nods. The bearded gentleman slowly nods back his wife walking to his side. Matthew strides closer to the couple.Nino will be happy to see you have returned Matthew said the innkeeper. His wife rested her hand upon her husbands shoulder very wearilyI know she has been most anxious to hear your stories again. Nino is...  The woman paused slight tears began to dew her eyes. She rested her head upon the innkeepers shoulder. The innkeeper patted his wifes head and looked back at MatthewNino is in her usual spot waiting for you. Her life has become very fragile. She may not wake even for you. The innkeeper paused again But the words and warmth of those around her can still reach her. As long as her heart beats she is still capable of hearing the words of her beloved ones. Matthew spoke I have a lot to tell her. He looked to the staircase left of the desk and proceeded up the stairs.     The moon is now at its highest in the night sky the soft lunar glow dimly bathing the floorboards of the room. Matthew shrugged his pack off and gently set it near the door. He walked over to the occupied bed. In it lay a girl a child whose life was barely hanging onto its last thread of fate. The moons windowshaped glow now slowly creeped over Ninos soft silvery cheek her green hair lay tuffled and still over her pillow. The thief sat upon the chair next to the girls bedIm back Nino. I hope I didnt make you wait too long. There was no response from Nino except her calmness. Her chest slowly rose slowly fell. Matthew knew of the troubled past Nino had held onto for so long as her health began to wane over the past two years. The ecstatic and curious child that Nino once was the child who looked brightly into others eyes asking things such as Whats the world like? Have you ever ridden a pegasus? How different are the people of other countries? barely existed now. She would commonly urge Matthew and others with exclamtions of Please dont forget me! I want to hear everything and anything you guys see! But of course how could anyone forget the young magestudent Nino? Who could forget the bright incandescence she brought to everyone around her? Matthew certainly could not forget. I saw many incredible things this time Nino.  I saw... oceans of sand dotted with giant dragon skeletons in the Nabata Desert. They were so giant you could slide down their bones for nearly a moment. I saw the beautiful night skies of Ilia washed away by millions of stars and colors. The stars and moon were so bright it was as if the sun had decided to stay up late. Matthew stopped his throat feeling choked by the stillness of Ninos body. He cleared his throat and began telling her of many more things he experienced while away. The tranquility of the ocean at night as the ship lightly swayed back and forth.The quiet damp but assuring comfort of a cave miles underground.The soft whispers of the air as it weaved between the forest trees.Riding a pegasus high into the Ilian night sky and grazing cloud tops with ones own hand.Matthew pray not tell the girl of the worlds ugliness he pray not describe the cynicism and selfishness of people. He wanted nothing more but to bring peace to Nino and satisfy her curiosity. Going on these long journeys to capture moments of Elibe was not for himself but only for Nino. He knew deep down that the youngling would never have the chance to experience the beauty of the world whilst forever remaining blissfully ignorant of the dark side of humanity. He wanted Nino to remain forever unaware of the prized treasures he stole and the lives he ended on the battlefield. For Nino to see his own dark past of fighting and killing to see the tortured soul who once knew of amorous love. Painting images of sweet nothings into Ninos ears seeing her smile or gently react in a kind way was something that could not be found at the bottom of a meads mug. The night looms on. The moonlight has now nearly disappeared from the bedroom with the morning warmth of the sun soon to wake. The inns owners have since been in the room as Matthew says his final goodbye to the last warmth of his life. Very soon Nino will cease to breath. She will never again hear or see the many beauties of the world that the weathered Matthew has shared with her. She will never be happy or cry or feel pain. No longer will she feel the coldness of her longgone terrible mother. Soon Nino you will embark on your own journey. You will go on a journey to a world that no one has ever seen a world that no one knows about. You will finally be able to leave your bed and see the outside world once again. You will finally see many things as wondrous as the stories Ive told you. Youll be free. Matthew gazed upon Ninos cheek realizing that a small smile had pursed her lips. And when your journey is over you can tell others the amazing sights youve seen just like Ive done for you.  Matthew reached his hand out to Ninos and softly spoke When you reach this new world youll get to see your parents again Nino. Your real parents. Your Mom and Dad who loved you so much long ago have been waiting for you all this time. Youll get to see them again as well as everyone else someday. Lord Hector Lyndis Eliwood Jaffar and even... Leila. Promise youll wait for the rest of us when you get there.But Matthew knew that they would never meet again for there is no place in the afterlife for a broken thief. So this isnt goodbye you hear me Nino?He then spoke his final words to her.Ill see you again. His final lie.A tear slowly apparates from Ninos eye gently sailing down her white cheek as her chest falls down in breath for one final time.,fireemblem,cjpguu6,5,t5_2t0cn

1990546,0,t3_2hhabb,Ike is the worst lord.  The.  Worst.  His character development in PoR is no different from previous lords with the only difference being that hes from a family of mercs instead of nobility.  I honestly think that the socioeconomic change made no difference.  Everyone flocked to him because he doesnt seem to care about the intricacies of the events around him and hes dull as dishwater.  And dont get me started on his RD appearance he might as well be renamed Gary Stu.  That rescue scene?  Gary Stu.  A literal Deus Ex Machina but with a supposed average joe instead of a Deus.  Really RD felt like it went off the rails.  Michaiah is not my favorite Lord but she certainly out of all the lords has the most flaws and the most depth.

2025722,0,t3_2hz1g6,Honestly as your doing this run I dont think there is anyone better suited to give you advice then me.You see there are a number of things that you should keep in mind. First of all use nearly every prepromote in the game. Trust me its completely worth it as all of them have pretty great growths an you can patch up the rest with scrolls... Which leads me to my next point.Abuse the fuck out of scrolls. Seriously this is something I kinda ignored in my playthrough and I regret it majorly. They are without a doubt the best items in the game and if you dont have at least one scroll on a person at one time then well your playong the game wrong.Next another important mechanic I missed that being capture. This is without a doubt one of the most fun mechanics in the entire series but more importantly your entire goddamn career depends on it. Dont be like me who had at the end of Manster completely broken weapons.If you insist on not using staffs then well your fucked up and should not do that even if I do it... No especially if I did it here is a real warning for you.Last but not least characters you should use.Othin and the MOTHERFUCKING PUGIHavana and his brave axeFinn as he is a great unit and has a fantastic exclusive weapon.Any and all Myrmidons except maybe Trude and definetly not Shanam especially Shiva and MareetaCarrion as he has the best growths in the game and allows you to keep scrolls on othersLara as she is your dancerFergus as he is tied for the highest crit in the game and supports Karin.Karin as she is your only flier for a very very long time.Dean as a amazing prepromote who has a fantastic exclusive weapon and of course is a flier.Asvel as he has arguably the best exclusive weapon in the game that allows him to always crit on the second hit. Not too mention he is overpowered as fuck and has some of the best promo gains in the series. Just dont use his staffs when he promotes.Any more guys?,fireemblem,ckxb90f,10,t5_2t0cn

One of the main reasons I will always love Awakening as much as I do is that it finally liberated the goddamn support system. Anyway the content and characters are still great.  also doesnt let you choose what class people promote into and it doesnt have a world map or the trainee classes that are in SS. It also this is kind of important doesnt have a fulltime convoy controlled by your main lord so the resource management is more importantif people get more than  items they have to drop one until you get your convoy guy. The beginning is also a tutorial so unless you get a save file to start from Lyn hard mode thats going to be annoying. If you do get a save file play Lyn hard mode then either Eliwood mode go back and play Hector later rather than starting with it.

Suprisingly slim under the hulking armour of a Knight but taller than most wears a signature headband and black stripes across his cheekbones and fights without a helmet. Appears to be constantly fatigued but moves and strikes with vigor and precision that would prove otherwise.Personality Orphelio is strong stubbourn and stern despite his physical frame enforcing the contrary. Orphelio prefers to fight single handedly after a wound in the line of duty left his nondominant left arm crumpled and frail. This unfortunately leaves Orphelio without the greatshield most other generals would use how Orphelio insists that this does not hinder his ability to fight or more importantly lead his men.Backstory The son to a famous general and war hero Orphelio is constantly reminded of his fathers doings and accomplishments and struggles to live up to the lineage presented to him. Having becoming a decorated soldier himself Orphelio is certainly no slouch but finds his achievements outmatched by his fathers near legendary status as a military strategist and fighter. After his recent injury Orphelio fought and pleaded against being discharged from duty his career not over in his mind until he had proved to everyone and himself that not only did he accomplish everything his father ever could but he did it on his own terms. While some might argue that disregarding his injury is brash and foolish Orphelio sees it as just another roadblock to go through as he continues to perform his duty in the shadow of his father. While some might expect Orphelio to have hit a glass ceiling of sorts due to his limitations Orphelios stubbornness and determination are just as strong a weapon as whats in his right hand.Okay with characters death?

Also I dont think Elincia will get more than  attacks on Sety and at least one of those will miss. Sety has Holsety giving him massive avoid and attack power.

2375715,0,t1_cm5ca5x,HM bonuses are generated just like normal enemy stats. You shouldnt consider HM bonuses to be a separate thing. For example a L unpromoted enemy with  HM bonus levels gets    levels.Recruitable enemies arent normal enemies but their HM bonuses are generated just like enemy stats  that is at the moment they appear on the map.The chapter  video should give you a clue. I mentioned that I manipulated Rutgers HM bonuses and a few seconds before I was randomly burning RNs with Lance.EDIT The reason why you might think that burning RNs before ending the previous map works is because certain recruitable enemies like Geitz from FE start on the map so the only way to manipulate his HM bonuses is to burn RNs before the map starts. If the enemy doesnt start on the map e.g. Harken then the HM bonuses can be manipulated midchapter. Hope that clears things up.,fireemblem,cm5ci0c,3,t5_2t0cn

2469649,0,t3_2nu8a2,Ah this chapter. I hate this chapter so much.  IIRC there should be many units that are reinforcements that are going to buttfuck you starting from the th or th turn? Therefore you want to clear out the first wave of enemies in front.  However DO NOT aggro the enemies ahead of you unless you are sure you can take care of a front and back result. iirc if you dont aggro the group in front of you they shouldnt rush. Be careful in the dealing of reinforcements and clear the last group of enemies.  As to who to send you should probably use all of your promoted units. Give Anna a Levin sword if available and use it against all of the bow knightsarchers. Theres  of your deployment slots gone.  Out of the rest of your units you can try to take MU but at only level  hes probably way too weak to be able to take the people out. That said at least try to use him as he is one of the most powerful units you can have. Take Panne and Nowi. You can go and summon Tiki from spotpass and buy a dragonstone from her. This will greatly help Nowi not get doubled and much tankier. I suggest you to not save after you buy the Dragonstone in case Nowi still isnt strong enough to take the strong units on.  Obviously you let Fred take too many kills early on in the game since hes already reclassed to Paladin and you didnt utilize MU enough. Try to train MU in the future and not let Fred have so many kills.  Best of luck friend. This is a tough chapter.,fireemblem,cmgy4ik,8,t5_2t0cn
2469704,0,t3_2ntaw5,Seeing everyone on the sub rant about RD and the older FEs make me want to play them.  But...   Call me a casual but I honestly just have more fun in Awakening than when I play PoR or FE.  Dont get me wrong those games are fun and Im slowly making my way through them. Its just that well I just get more frustrated more easily in those games. Its probably just because I suck at the older ones.  I fucking love FE art style though. The way Lyns sword clinks when you slide it back Farinas over the top attacks on a Pegasus. I always turn off animations on the other games because theyre boring but not FEs. I cant get enough of the critical animations.  Id really rather have the next FE on a DS as well. I dont have a Wii U and I cant afford one. T.T,fireemblem,cmgydaz,1,t5_2t0cn

The emulators to get for those are gonna be I use FCEUGX for NES games but theres plenty of different choices that all work just as well. ZSNES or SNESx for the Super Nintendo Dolphin for both Gamecube and Wii Some fork of VBA for Gameboy Advance I use VBAM personally DeSuME or NoGBA plus NoZoomer for DS.

2892676,0,t3_2t8f8n,Luna is almost always the better skill because of when it is useful Luna gets stronger as the enemy gets stronger while astra gets stronger as the enemy gets weaker. The basic logic is obvious the higher enemy defense the more you cut but the effect is exacerbated by FEs linear mechanics. Damage is additive in FE that is your attack powers are all added while defense is subtracted. The skills however are multiplicative resulting in exponential increases in damage as base damage decreases and base stats increase. Early game Luna does little my  damage attack against  defense is only boosted from  to  by Luna while astra goes from  to  approx  vs . Late game however its not even close a  damage attack against  defense goes from  to  damage vs. Astras   vs. . Sure Astra will do more if you have high attack and they have low defense but then who cares? you are likely going to get the kill anyway. So yeah Luna does more damage as game goes on and does it when it matters. And that is not even considering its higher activation rate.There is one place for Astra though on high skill characters with Sol. Sol will proc before Luna but after Astra and skills cannot proc together  so every proc of Sol prevents a Proc of Luna. At low levels this is barely noticeable but if you were using say a skl MU with Limit Breaker who was topping a  skill your odds of procing Luna would actually be a pretty dismal . Astra on the other hand because it checks for procs first would have a  chance of procing while Sol would have a  chance. You may need lots of Sol procs neither is strictly better but it does give Astra a niche. i dont think Stahl learns Sol anyway? but for other characters might be good to know,fireemblem,cnwwg9h,6,t5_2t0cn

If you grab Morgan you have a great combo but this kind of run is typically poor about training many of the other characters.You could grab Sol before chapter  since its mostly an Avatar solo. You second seal twice if you want both vantage and armsthrift and then master seal to hero but if youre doing it immediately you actually have some room to maneuver. But since she gets Aether Veterans probably a better pick anyway.,fireemblem,cobc9i5,1,t5_2t0cn

3036465,0,t1_cocoa67,If anything I think Soldiersparticularly the RD versionprove that specialization is overrated in Fire Emblem or rather not all stats are equally useful and its better to have enough in a few areas than to be overpowered in one less important area.Speed Strength and Defense are far more important than Skill Luck and Resistance. You only need so much Defense you want enough Resistance so ordinary Mages dont nuke you and most units are fine on HP.Thing is Sentinels have plenty of all three. They dont overkill Defense like Marshalls while skipping on Speed and movement Aran kind of does growthwise. They dont overkill Speed and Skill like Trueblades. And they have enough Strength to ORKO most enemies. Their Skill and Luck arent lacking either.As a bonus Nephs Resistance is phenomenal though again not that it needs to be that great.They really dont suck at anything...which is more than many classes can say.

It was a stress fracture caused by opening and closing the clamshell design repeatedly which its designed to do.Despite a number of similar cases having been reported online from users of the original model Nintendo DS including one person stating Nintendo fixed theirs Nintendo evaluated mine and said they wouldnt fix it because it was due to negligence.Ill probably look to sell it in the near future.

3130362,0,t1_comeh4c,Fire Emblems had some implied at least enough for fanon samesex relationships before. I kind of doubt theyd actually go all the way and explicitly say These two men are now married or something like that. Japan as a whole tends to have a much more conservative view so like you said its unlikely.Anyway if they go back to the old support system where characters only have  possible marriage partners at least one samesex couple would definitely be a nice inclusion. If they keep it like Awakening though where part of the fun is matchmaking it might get a little messy. Would you have separate sets of straight characters and gay characters? Would everyone be bisexual? Would there just be a couple bisexual characters who can either marry someone of the opposite sex OR the other character who happens to be the only other one open to a samesex relationship? Its tricky to handle it in a satisfying way I think.,fireemblem,comgkbh,6,t5_2t0cn

FE Marcia after her BEXP investment steals experience from Makalov.

So I was given some squishy mage an overlevelled thief who seemed obsessed with her for some reason some axe guy a cool looking archer who I ended up using also I dont care what people say about Leo hes awesome   . But the first character I really liked was Edward. I used him as my main killing force in the DB and he was a good match for the greils too my first attempt at  he killed Mia who I was also using. He was probably overlevelled but there was something really cool about swordmasters and I just thought Eddie seemed like a really fun guy.

War Cleric is a terrible class with a great skill Renewal that she would be able to pass down to Owain one of the easier to get children at cost of her own usage.

She has two femaleonly class so she can get both Dual Support and Galeforce which will be passed down to Owain. Valkyrie is certainly the class that shell end in as have both staves and tomes.

A newbie FE LTCer might say Im going to use Nolan without stopping to consider that Jill is just plain better for instance.So what Im getting at is that youve listed some solid decent units but there are other units that can help you really get those low turncounts. Makalov and Astrid are decent units but are either of them going to be more helpful than Soren who can use siege tomes with a lot of investment? Lethe is solid on paper but between lacking range and not having an upgradable weapon is she really an important part of your plans? Are supports important enough to be worth building a team around? And so on.,fireemblem,cprx8ji,3,t5_2t0cn

Lack of actives and an enemy phase mean literally nothing when they give some nice pairup bonuses and cool damage even on enemy attacks. Virion in particular gives a great strength bonus from the beginning of the game. Not to mention how complex a character he is. Sure he has the womanizer role but hes much deeper than that.

3525503,0,t3_30nes8,I honestly dislike her as a unit. She is slow and inaccurate and even comes with a Thunder Tome to compound that issue in a game in which those issues are absolute sins. Lugh and even Hugh outclass her because they can hit things easily enough. She is an earlygame growth unit with  Skill and  Speed with rather mediocre bases for both stats. She is simply bad despite her rather impressive Magic.She also has awful base stats. A Level  Mage at Chapter  is awful especially given that most of your characters at this time will be at approximately Level . One of those characters will likely also be Lugh meaning that once you receive her you will most likely already have a better Mage. She is also in a game which is notoriously strict with Guiding Rings making her very lowpriority when you have more important people to use them on  Lugh Clarine Saul and even Elen and Hugh are generally better choices for them. Ignoring the Chapter  Guiding Ring which is disgustingly late you have three Guiding Rings one of which requires guiding Sofia through a Fog of War desert map making her again very lowpriority when compared to your other magic users.She does however have a good Support with Roy which does help her evasion and accuracy issues and builds rather quickly though she is still a rather difficult unit to use and is generally not worth the effort.,fireemblem,cpu4rxm,2,t5_2t0cn

3562650,0,t3_314f3m,Moving my own points was made before the mega hereSMTxFE Apparently its Persona or maybe just standard SMT if the demons were replaced with the Fire Emblem verse.Im not quite sure what to think on this I wasnt even sure what I was watching at first especially with the amount of fanservice yeesh but yeah Im much more interested now I was honestly expecting something like Devil Survivor but this looks like something not even really belonging to either franchise.It also appears to have a lot of designs similar to the FE specifically the two rival leaders.I cant wait for this call me hyped.Also Anyone else spot Young!Tiki? Or someone that looks near identical to young!Tiki?FE Two paths? Interesting. Custom actual main character? Eh not a huge fan but its better idea then spotlightstealing Robin.The suggestion by the dancer about averting war also alludes to a third path neutrality I would assume.Some new animations look good but mon dieu the art design is busy as fuck. Im honestly not a fan. It also looks like theyre making this Japan Hoshido vs Europe Nohr as evident by the Hoshidans being blatantly Nipponese with the katanas and the lacquered armour while the Nohr prince is a primadonna Blond Germanic leader type with a straight sword Nohr itself may be a derivation from say the Ruhr region of Germany but thats a stretch.Need to see more gameplay to get a feel for either game but they look ok going forward.Smash Character? Call me a traitor but I voted for Zero specifically Mega Man Zero series Zero. I considered Sety but that wouldve meant typing in his official name and I couldnt bear the thought of validating that awful localization and also Sigurd but really there are enough swordsmen from FE.,fireemblem,cpyd9mg,2,t5_2t0cn

3569408,0,t1_cpz4tik,LexAyra is commonly agreed to be Ayras best pair.By giving the kids minor Neir blood they get very good bulk as in they actually cap defence. This is very useful for when their high dodge fails them. They also are strong with Lex as a father and he helps them reach their high Strength cap of .Elite is passed down allowing them to gain more experience which is all but necessary for a foot unit to remain relevant in FE. Vantage is also very useful to them as they can combine it with an Astra proc a crit or a Brave Sword strike to avoid counterattacks all together.For Holyn he has the advantage of passing down Luna which is likely more useful than Sol. Sol is very good but the kids are fairly durable without it especially in Holyn or Lexs case. If Dew were as good in his own right as Holyn hed probably be better except for a massive HP deficiency in comparison to Holyn but Dew starts  levels lower than Holyn and is depending on your definition of good either never a good combat unit or has to wait until after promotion to be one.

I was really enjoying the bit of XCOM I had played and I had heard FE played similarly to an extent so this paired with it being one of the DSs best titles I decided to pick it up. Love love loved it bought FE going to play FE next etc. Im also shameless shippy trash. As much as I love the core gameplay I also really love the character interactions supports and making characters marry each other as much as I know thats a bit of a sore spot for some of this sub.

3699593,0,t1_cqdwi4n, I actually think FE did a fairly good job of reimagining the story while respecting the original. Having Leif and Celice split up for a while is pretty cool because it gives Leif more importance in the story of Genealogy. I mean Leifs story is actually pretty cool I think he deserves the credit. Fun fact about Cyas he loses more leadership after chapter  if you dont get Sety. Its like baitandswitch. Blaggi is also armor effective and is capable of ORKing Reidric so I think it has some merit. I actually like FE for not giving you a ton of superpowered holy weapons the personal powerful weapons for longer system is more fun and interesting IMO. I mean as good as Ragnell is Ike with a moderately OP sword from chapter  on would beat the shit out of Ike with a stupidly OP sword for the last  chapters. Or both like Chrom has. I think you have the most statistically powerful Thracia team ever. Not like it makes a lick of a difference though outside of Homer. That shits messed up. Locked doors are Tinas biggest saving grace as a unit. As much as Im not a fan of the new names but man Project Naga fixing all the bugs in Thracia is an exciting thought.

Her supports with Harken fixes her sort of questionable killing ability like it should.

Shes hardly wall material like Lowen and shes not an early crutch like Marcus but shes not horrifically bad.Characterwise I really like Isadora as a person shes reserved and reasonable even when shes under emotional strain. She really makes you feel as if shes a seasoned warrior with out being the kind of gloom and doom such a role often entails. She does have a breaking point though and his name is Harken and that it why I can never bear to A support her with anyone else.

3734577,0,t3_332m22,Im just gonna copypaste this from a response I made on this thread.I feel like storywise Awakenings story was bad. It had no sense of pacing whatsoever it was filled out with plot holes and there was just absolutely nothing consistent about it. The three arcs seemed out of place with each other. Objectively it was a bad story. FE stories are usually very simplistic and just not that great but Awakening just added a bunch of halfassed plot devices and it just became especially as bad.Characters will always be subjective. Im not gonna say Awakening characters have no depth. I think people being able to support anyone was a huge mistake though as even though there are really good ones they are really watered down with boringIm bad at cooking Im good at cooking! Ill teach you how to cook. Thanks !  gtSupport rank increasedI think thats the only problem with Awakenings characterssupport system. I do think that was a mistake.Awakenings mechanics are kind of a mix between objective and subjective. PreAwakening mechanics were much deeper and had much more strategic depth. Awakening really just doesnt compare in that regard. Examples of this are maps that arent just a boring open field objectives other than Rout the enemy much more tame grinding Im not gonna pretend like grinding hasnt always been in FE support bonuses that arent nearly as broken etc. But the thing is those mechanics arent for everyone. Awakenings mechanics are much more accessible and just overall much more easy to get into. This is why I think it is subjective.The problem with this however is that it feels like IS kinda betrayed their own fan base just to appeal to more casual players. That sounds silly but it really is how it feels. I know that the casual aspect is likely one of the major reasons that Awakening sold so well and thus allowed the series to continue but it just doesnt seem fair that they just left us in the dust. Sure we can play on Lunatic for a challenge but thats just RNG bullshit hard not fun hard. Thats why I just cant stand to see people dismiss peoples negative opinions on the game as just blind hatredcirclejerking. That honestly stops me from browsing this sub a majority of the time. All of peoples negative opinions are  warranted but at the same time so are peoples positive opinions. FE seems to be addressing this problem with the different routes which Im happy about.,fireemblem,cqhysv7,1,t5_2t0cn

3754919,0,t1_cqjx2xx,gt good againAlright lets be reasonable here. Awakenings support system was not even bad overall. It didnt absolutely require you to position units next to each other so supports could build more naturally without screwing over any semblance of strategy. It visualized when support growth happens. The bonuses from supports were obvious do the gba games ever specify what the affinities each do in game? and pretty reasonable though the pair up system is still too powerful thats only tangentially relatedIt doesnt make sense to limit support conversations to  especially when that means you dont get to hear the full story from one of the characters. If the bonuses are too strong  when you have supports with everyone then the bonuses should simply scale better. Having everyone support everyone will force some conversations to be generic but how is that actually a bad thing? Why should we choose nothing over a bit generic? In fact I think the only subpar aspect of the support system in awakening is the script for the most part. Everything else is improved. ,fireemblem,cqkadqm,13,t5_2t0cn

3787776,0,t3_33sjo8,Awakening is rather different than most games in the series although its most similar game is Sacred Stones.Awakening however focuses less on ..tactics? and a lot on marrying your units reclassing to get the best skills and had a fair few mechanics not in either of the two games youve played you can however play Awakening in ways to make it more like a normal FE game such as refusing to reclassgrinduse a mechanic called pair up. Whilst a world map and grinding against monsters is abnormal Sacred Stones also does it so its not as dissimilar as if you had only played like FE and FE sacred stones is FE. In general Awakening is well loved by people new to the series because it is very newcommer friendly but within the community who have already played it some value it less than the other games although it is still a great game.I personally would say Awakening is worse than the two games youve played as I LOVE FE the one with Hector and Lyn and Sacred Stones but Awakening is still a great game. Id say its a good buy as for if its worth buying a whole console for well there are a bunch of other games for the DS that you could check out I wouldnt be able to say if a whole DS is worth it for just one game. ,fireemblem,cqo1bvc,4,t5_2t0cn

Sain and Kent will fit any role you need but Lowen fills a niche if you dont need his niche in a particular chapter his usefulness falls off which is why hes as low as he is despite being a cav and having the best availability this side of Eliwood.Worst Louise. I was planning on voting for Dorcas today but the arguments against have swayed me. Dorcas has good enough bases to be helpful filler in the earlygame and the earlygame is arguably the hardest part. Louise has an A support with Pent but bowlock is bad no matter how you slice it and she struggles to contribute meaningfully out of the gate.

3926498,0,t3_35f6k5,Oh Sophia... finally a unit that I can rag on to my hearts content.Sophia is in my top  least liked units Id say and its all due to the fact that she has every appearance of being an Est without actually being one.  Her growths seem Estlike at first with a  in Mag really jumping out at you... but then you see the rest. Spd  Luck  Def and  Hp is inexcusable on a unit that starts with such bases.  Her Spd is by far the most egregious offender with a character that has only  con Flux has  weight for the curious needing every point of Spd they can get.  Sure you can say that training her gets you a magical nuke but...She exists in the same game as Lilina.  Why would aside from personal preference which is cool! you ever train up Sophia with her  Mag instead of Lilina with her  Mag!?  Lilina comes earlier has far better maps to train on has a fast growing support with Roy and isnt saddled with the heaviest magical tomes.  Sophia joins on the worst chapter she can join on and is one of the multitude of reasons chapter  is considered hell.  Even if you do go through the pain of raising her she will generally be inferior to Niime who joins ready to go.  Dont get me wrong I like Ests and growth units but I would be loathe to consider Sophia either of these.This is honestly a shame as she really is a unique character.  A halfdragon who apparently knows Athos and possibly by association s Nergal.  She is unable to change into a dragon but as she cannot  use Fas dragonstone and never acquires one herself we can never be sure that she couldnt.  Finally we can see that she has longevity on her side having the exact same appearance in both FE and FE.Personally?  I do not like her.  Her character is interesting but this girl has put player after player through hairpulling frustration on chapter  to warrant her a place a the bottom of the list.,fireemblem,cr3uueo,7,t5_2t0cn

3973267,0,t3_35yz4l,Gonna write a comment for each of the survey questions. Note Did not love Awakening and am skeptical for IF. Im aware much of the community is optimistic and enjoys awakening so if this bothers you dont read onwards.  Ive been back and forth between wanting to get Nohr and not planning to buy any. Rather against the idea of any but the most conservative DLC likely wont ever play all  paths but may play Nohr if I feel optimistic enough at release.  Dont like the disappearance of durability. I did like the repair system in  but even that seems unlikely since technically it involved durability. I could come around to liking it if in actual practice it is built properly into the gameplay.  Hard to say as already said I need to see how it actually pans out ingame as a whole mechanic.  I prefer going into games spoiler free so I answered blind but being so pessimistic about returning mechanics of awakening and mechanics of IF I will likely have to spoil myself somewhat and get a feel for the game before a potential purchase.  Indifferent I didnt like the mechanic in awakening so I mostly ignored it. Strongly leaned towards no because I would rather it didnt exist not enough to warrant writing off the game by itself by far.  Rescue strongly preferred.  Nope Im not playing with fire on this one.  I prefer specific promotion items but only slightly. Happy any way this falls.  I dont like reclassing at all. It turns unit into walking growthsbases and takes away some of their character as well a character.,fireemblem,cr96p01,1,t5_2t0cn

Like when you attack its a guaranteed dual attack but it does something dickish to the other character therefore either hurting them or something as well as lower their support. Dual Guard can be like the character using the paired character as a human shield and that could hurt your other character but lower support. ,fireemblem,crau6ow,2,t5_2t0cn

3992382,0,t3_366zmj,For gameplay stuff Id recommend getting Lost Bloodlines amp and Rogues and Redeemers . You get Dread Fighter out of LB Paragon out of LB and Limit Breaker out of RampR. The difficulty of the missions is pretty balanced to the point in the game you should be able to beat them where youd be hardpressed to beat RampR until youre at the endgame with characters that are starting to cap stats anyway.LB is also an extremely good grinding map for quickly getting highlevel characters more skills from other classes as there are a ton of enemies but most of them arent too powerful plus you rack up paragon scrolls while doing it. I was able to take a Morgan with veteran and paragon getting minimum exp from each enemy all the way from level  to  as a paladin in a single go.Once youre in the endgame you might want to grab Infinite Regalia as well both because you can get legendary weapons from it and because the reward is the Silver Card which halves the cost of items in shops and makes it easier to buy things like brave weapons and killing edges without running out of money in the postgame.,fireemblem,crbd5od,1,t5_2t0cn

4048185,0,t3_36wmc0,. Speed is not only easier for planning out your classes but for playing through Lunatic. I recommend mulling the idea over.. Consider removing Lonqu from Severa. Brady loves Speed more than anything else. So Lonqu as Bradys dad can help with planning.. Nah should only be receiving the bare minimum. She wont be receiving Galeforce nor Aggressor so consider her your last thing to decide give her the left over scraps. At best shell be performing as pair up fodder for a Maleforce child so as to still have a pairing that can kill two enemies at once. Familiarize yourself with pair up bonuses that increase Speed and give her a class that does so at least and has a high skill. Kellams Assassin works well because you arent losing anything by giving Nah the minus Speed modifier.. Keep in mind that Ricken Stahl and Virion are all in the same boat. They all give Archer a fanstastic class to give to Gerome Yarne and whosoever needs it. Support Units or Units in the back. Any particular reason you are marrying Robin to Owain? The pairing is sufficient but there are better ones.The overall layout is very similar to how I format my teams. So I approve for the most part.Some pointers to Lunatic It doesnt require many units. Avatar solos are possible even on noDLC. You need a good start however. I think I recall needing  Strength  Speed and about  Defense for a really easy time in Chapter One. By the time you hit Chapter  you should be having  Speed because there is a rather speedy Fighter on the mountains to the left on Chapter . These are Lunatic  strats however. You dont need as much effort on Lunatic.KuroiTsubasaTenshi on Serenes Forests has posted a guide on how to beat Lunatic  no reset and I believe you should give it a read.Edit There is more to late game than just pairings.

4165739,0,t1_cruxbd8,People often mistake Robin for a selfinsert which is understandable since the game tells you he is a selfinsert.Seriously though there is nothing remotely selfinsert about him. You dont play the game from his perspective. In battle he is no different than any other unit. In story scenes he isnt even necessarily present. In movies a couple are from his perspective but most are third person and focus on Chrom.  He keeps secrets from you! Seriously the big plot twist of the game is based around Robin hatching a plot to fool everyone and the player is not made aware of it until it is revealed. But according to the game you are Robin! Why are you Robin hatching plots that you arent telling yourself the player about. If Robin really were you you would know the plot the second you came up with it.  You keep secrets from Robin! The player gets a flyonthewall presence in the meetings of the antagonists which reveals information Robin would definitely like to know. If Robin were actually the player he would know everything the player does! If the player is actually supposed to be Robin they cant give you an outofbody experience where you float off to spy on the enemies. In short Robin as a character doesnt even resemble a selfinsert. So the big question is why does the game insist on pretending he is one? Its not like that is necessary at all. Remove all the selfinsert business and Robin is just a special character who you get to customize. Which is all he really is. ,fireemblem,crv3pvc,20,t5_2t0cn

I simply think of it and I believe its presented this way as something you just walk up to and click the Abutton. Like the Barracks except actually reliable.What worries me at this point I may have expressed this to you before cant remember if I have or not is that it is looking rather likely that the availability of miningfarming resources will be based on realtime. Which if you ask me anything based on realtime is out of place in a strategy game because it is inherently unbalanced. There is no way to balance a feature that is so variable in how it distributes resources. Either A the game is balanced assuming you arent waiting to accumulate resources and therefore you cant choose to use this feature without breaking the difficulty or B the game is balanced assuming you will wait to accumulate resources and then it just becomes frustrating if you like to play in long sessions or C the feature makes so little impact on gameplay that it might as well not be there which is just disappointing.

4242951,0,t3_39gvj1,I personally dont see why its optional is not a defense.Barracks from FEA are pretty stupid and a hassle to keep track of but it doesnt ruin my experience because I almost never use it and my gaming experience is not hindered as a result. Unless you cant beat a certain mission without rubbing your units faces first I see it as a non issue. I mean in Pokemon Y I only used Poke Amie to evolve an eevee and show off my shiny pokemon. Outside of that never. And I dont feel like my experience was hindered.Youre certainly entitled to not like the feature but Ive seen people form expectations that this game is gonna suck because of features like that. Please do correct me if Im wrong as I havent read every If detail yet but Id expect the bonuses received from face rubbing to be nonessential to the success of battle. I expect these bonuses to be minor rewards for taking part in them showing off their mastery of manipulating the ds hardware. Again. You can hate the feature. I personally am not crazy about it and will likely only use it a couple times for the laughs. But in the same breath I cant say that it isnt optional and it certainly shouldnt ruin anyones overall experience unless face rubbing is indeed a requirement for success. Like I said. Face rubbing seems pretty meh. The my castle designer feature is okay as long as its not as time consuming as Animal Crossing. What I do like out of that My Castle thing is that the castle essentially becomes a custom level that people can challenge. A feature that Ive been hoping for since I first got Awakening. Streetpass battles got stale after a while because it just became about the technical stuff of how well did he or she train their team before I streetpassed them. Going into their town and wrecking it while battling their units is a bit more personal. I like that along with many other things Ive seen out of this game.

4298216,0,t3_3a7oyg,Alright well in my personal opinion I would go with Lyon. More specifically I would say Ephraims route Lyon. I want to note that this is spoilers the essay so dont bother reading if you have a problem with that.Lyon in Erikas route is a nice guy who got possessed by a demon. Thats about it. We do find somethings out about him like how he experimented with dark magic and stuff and felt inferior to his father but not much else.Ephraims route though and Lyon is a very different beast. Here we see that Lyon had some issues even before he started to get possessed. He had a crush on Erika that he was too shy to act on and had a grudge against Ephraims confidence and ability. He finds out through his experiments that soon in the future a landslide will wipe out most of his kingdom. He quickly starts trying to find a way to prevent it but results arent panning out.Although we do see some results of his powers. We find out that he can save someone near death with his powers that healing magic couldnt help. However he cant bring back the dead which was one of the first goals that he came up with.At some point his eyes turned to the dark stone that his kingdom held the one that housed Fomortiis. He decided that desperate times called for desperate measures and started to experiment with it. Fomortiis at some point saw an opportunity and started to talk to Lyon.He offered Lyon the power to do all the things that he wanted the power to stop the rockslide the power to bring back the dead and the power to save his father who at this point was dying. Lyon at first rejects the demon king knowing that faustian deals like this never work out.But then Lyons father died. And here is a critical point in the story. Lyon could have just taken the throne like a normal prince would have. But Lyon was convinced that he would lead his people to ruin if he was in charge. And so out of desperation he agreed to let Fomortiis out in exchange for the ability to bring his father back to life.Now at this point things start to become unclear. We arent told how long Lyon held out once Fomortiis started taking him over as its a bit inconsistent between routes. For the purposes of the argument Im going with the version of Lyon that appears to fight back on some level.Lyon does indeed get the power to bring his father back to life. But he then also has his insecurities blown up to insane levels. Now he hates Ephraim and is so obsessed with Erika that Valter would be telling him to tone it down if he knew about it.The combination of the two things drives him to invade their kingdom in an attempt to sate both feelings for the twins. Now he does this and it goes brilliantly partially thanks to Orson giving him information in return for bringing back his dead wife which Lyon also does.I would point out that he didnt have to do that by the way. If he told Orson to fuck off afterwards Orson couldnt do much about it. Most of their military was still dead by this point. This is a sign that Lyon is still in control enough to want to honor his agreement.Lyon is eventually corrupted enough where his priorities are completely skewed yes. But that is after quite a long time for certain. At least in Ephraims route. And even then there are signs to show that he wasnt completely taken over until the very last moment before the final boss fight. But even ignoring all that I sort of want to give it to Lyon for a lot more of a petty reason I dont consider Arvis the main antagonist. I would probably give that to Manfroy if anyone. Arvis is used by the Lopto Sect as a puppet to regain their power base. Which granted is similar to how Fomortiis uses Lyon. I sort of wish we had a main villain in these games that wasnt being manipulated by someone and was still sympathetic.So that would make Lyon the main villain while still being sympathetic. You could make an argument for Lehran certainly but Ive got problems with that guy. And of course this is my opinion. But Im not discounting either of them all are great villains but Lyon wins out by a fraction of an inch for me.,fireemblem,csa4rtn,4,t5_2t0cn

4301585,0,t1_csaia57,Its not really. Its a superficial change. They replaced swords with tomes and otherwise hes the same Owain from Awakening. Being a swordsman was not a key component of his character  it was his flair for the dramatic and LARP shenanigans that made him stand out. He simply channeled those things through the lens of a swordsman. Channeling them through the lens of a magic user instead is a fairly minor difference. Think about it what new meaningful aspect of his character can be learned from him using magic instead of a sword? I cant think of a damn thing.What I mean by basically the same is that their actual behavior is unchanged from their Awakening versions. New Owain is still overly dramatic and loves giving his weapons ostentatious names. New Inigo is a charmer who loves to dance. New Severa is constantly comparing her performance to others. Whats the difference between these characters and their Awakening versions? Presumably the reasons for this behavior. But thats the opposite of the AU approach. In an AU youd do something like make the nd generation Awakening characters come from a future where their parents are still alive and fighting Grima and see how that changes their personalities and how they relate to the past versions of their parents. In Fates they have their new backstories specifically constructed so they end up in effectively the same metaphorical place. Its not a reexamination of the characters but just an excuse to reuse old ones.,fireemblem,csaiha8,0,t5_2t0cn

Whether this was done out of fanservice or purely out of laziness its a disturbing choice on the part of the developers that speaks very poorly of their mindset in designing this game.,fireemblem,cseecz5,3,t5_2t0cn
4336105,0,t1_cseb3nc,gt Well... the premise for Fates  specifically the fact that weve got ourselves a pair of dragons again  seems to imply that were before Awakening in the larger series chronology not after it.Im curious why that would imply a preAwakening spot in the chronology. Is it because there were so few dragons in Awakening? That seems to be true of most of the games.And I dont really think Ive been misconstruingexaggerating about Fates being its own world. Maybe its coming across differently than I mean it but what Im trying to say is basically the exact same as thisgt I think they made it pretty clear that Fates was a new setting without any clear and direct plot relationI dont really want to debate about the unified worlds theory but Ive never seen it or the outrealms as canon. And if that was their excuse to include characters from the world of Awakening if thats what these are I would still consider it a violation of the claim that Fates would be its own distinct game.Finally Im really not trying to argue that these characters are somehow connected to their Awakening lookalikes. Personally I do think its more likely that its just laziness on the part of the developers. My original point was just that both possible explanations for these characters appearances either developer laziness or an unrevealed Awakening connection would be bad.,fireemblem,cseeq07,1,t5_2t0cn

4364171,0,t1_cshi3ym,You misunderstood me. You speak solely of mechanics that have been changed. In the end the level design has still changed marginally if at all. All the minor tweaks they did to the mechanics excluding the weapon triangle which Ill talk about in a sec have not done much to change the type of strategies players still use. People still use turtling and bait and switch the biggest offender. The new mechanics rarely encourage players to use new tactics such as rush in heal later. This makes levels boring and stagnant. It feels like youre doing the same thing over and over. The abundance of resources all the time make it so normal incentives like villages and shops are obsolete. Ill expand on this further if you want and even make a thread about it but now let me get to the weapon triangle.Its completely arbitrary. It honestly looks like a feeble attempt by IS to make Fire Emblem mechanics more complex. In reality all they did was make Fates even more different from the rest of the series. Bowusers already had their advantages effectiveness against flying units and the ability to use Longbows. Obviously theres a lot to be desired but putting them in the weapon triangle means they wont gain OR lose usefulness. Sure now they have  more thing that theyre effective against but they also have something ELSE theyre weak to. In short it accomplished nothing in the context of making archers more appealing to use.Ive rambled enough but Id be more than happy to elaborate on any of these points.

4365137,0,t1_cshob9o,But thats not whats happening in this video. Its showing her body off yeah but being sexy shouldnt take away power from someone.Though this all depends on the context. Humans are by nature sexual beings so her having a sexual relationship doesnt take away from her believability and in fact if its done right I think it adds to it. Even the most stoic of people have a range of emotions and seeing them expressed in their own unique way adds to it.If it was as simple as You unlocked Lucina! Time to make her beg! then sure I would agree thats objectifying her. But showing off a character under their own agency at least within the context of a story like we see with Camilla isnt objectification.Lets look at a real world example for instance. Anne Hathaway. Very beautiful. Very sexy. Shes not afraid to show it.. but shes also a very intelligent and progressive person whos stood up for her beliefs on multiple occasions.

It would be interesting to see what would happen if all of the Heirs to Chroms throne were unable to ascend either due to dying or marrying off into other countrys royal families.

As for tonal dissonance I personally dont think Ill have much of an issue I can usually keep this all compartmentalized pretty easily but I dont think removing the fanservice would change much in that area.  Youd still go around gathering materials and talking to people like nothing in the story just happened.  I dont think you could change much about that without almost completely removing down the feature.  But I along with many others in the thread dont feel the removal of fanservice needs to be changed in the first place.

People eat that shit up too.gtDocile as in they dont have very aggressive advances on your units?In Awakening wed see enemies very commonly instantly aggressive at the start of the level and groups of enemies aggro on to you when you walk into the range of one.In Fates . . . It seems like theyre not entirely unaggressive but we far too often see Oh you walked into range of one enemy. That individual will now come to you while the friends sit back and eat popcorn. Hurdur. At all is too often on lunatic really.gtIs the pairup vastly different from FEA?Yes. Pair up in Awakening and Fates have vastly different dynamics. Awakenings pair up has dual strike and dual guard as well as stat boosts all come into play when you pair up  on the other hand you only get dual guard and stat boosts or dual strike and dual strike requires you to be beside a unit not paired to a unit so the back of the pair up isnt always safe not if you want the extra damage.Dual strike always goes off although can obviously miss so its like a regular attack but half pretty sure anyway damage.Dual guard builds up as you battle and then it will go off  its just more consistent about its triggering just like dual strike.Basically theres more diversity in how it comes into play and more consistency but less power. ,fireemblem,csnmony,3,t5_2t0cn

4423347,0,t3_3bpd74,Theres nothing concrete yet. Assumptions are being drawn due to some of the censored parts of Awakening. Darker tones in Awakening were removed or edited. Like Henrys being placed in an orphanage and being abuse by his caretakers was changed to wizard school where nothing bad happened. A cape was placed on the lower half of Tharjas body in the Summer Scramble DLC fanservice artwork because it was too revealing. Any incestual relationships like Lucina  Owain were relabeled as Companions instead of Husband and Wife. Europe removed the mention of boingy bits between Tharja and Nowis conversation in the Harvest Scramble DLC.So theres a lot of worry that instead of a direct and faithful translation that well be getting a version that changes some aspects of the story. It wont be surprising with all the fanservice that will be appearing like Camilla Amie stuff.

4451495,0,t3_3c2x13,The problem with Roy is that he drops off way too much after chapter . I will agree with you that he has some contributions but I think that you overestimate those contributions. Early game he does good damage sure but hes fairly fragile albeit thats a problem for every early game character in binding blade. If he wants to keep up he needs kills that would be better off going to Allance Rutger Dieck hell maybe even Lugh. Post chapter  the damage he does is minimal since hes not doubling anything. Even in the axe heavy chapters  and  you have Allance Rutger Dieck and Fir mediocre but usable in HM all of who can do what Roy does but much better. From there you are better off carting him. The face that Binding Blade actually has a difficulty due to massive amounts of wyverns and siege tomes are cons for Roy. His promotion very late in coming gives him some boosts and his SoS is decent but that still has only  uses. You have hammerne but what gives SoS priority over Warp which is a lot more useful? Not to mention the existence of the SoS does not prevent your other units from using the legendary weapons to destroy manaketes. IMO had Roys promotion came earlier perhaps after  then Id give him credit for being the best designed lord. The fact of the matter is that hes really not contributing for half of the game and I dont think you can consider him the best lord when Leif exists.,fireemblem,csrsnvh,8,t5_2t0cn

However by the time you move him back to General through those classes hell probably have killer stats regardless.  War Cleric is also a good path for him believe it or not because Renewal makes him a better tank.

4506261,0,t1_csyfm89,I dont know about this one. It represents the first genuine threat from promoted enemies in the game due to how clustered they are and because of mov Griffon Riders and Paladins. Meanwhile Warriors and Sages are foot units with devastating attack power and Swordmasters can be difficult to double. It manages to prioritize the enemy phase while never allowing most units to take on many foes.The lava gimmick sounds interesting on paper but in practice its spread is so slow and its damage so nonthreatening Im pretty sure it isnt even lethal i.e. wont drop you below  HP that youre never really forced to move quickly. Moreover while the choke points can be used to the players advantage the whole map is so cramped that success mostly comes down to not overextending and pulling too many enemies rather than cleverly using terrain. It feels vaguely turtley is what Im getting at.That said I have lost one chest before rightmost nearest boss from moving too slowly so its not improbable you can miss out from playing poorly.

I need three of those for Garcia Joshua and Marisa.

Lyn wasnt created at a time where that was a big deal so I dont think she counts. If Rekka No Ken was made in a later time things might have been different. As for your other comments The characters talking to Mark is not fanservice or even breaking the fourth wall. Especially if you name your tactician Mark. Its creepy and its kinda annoying but its not fanservice nor is it a big deal. They dick ride you because you are literally the person controlling every single unit and because you are the primary reason they are alive and fighting an insane war. You are their savior. This of course implies you named your avatar after yourself if not. Then Mark is this character. A character who doesnt have a set personality but has some traits such as generosity and a thirst for adventure.

Which is why I thought of artworks instead of grades since it would avoid the scenario with dondons run. Also lots of casuals dont play for rankings so the grading system doesnt motivate them to do better but a lot of casuals will play better if it gets them pretty artwork or other unlockables at the end.And yeah time should be included for speedrunners.

4737126,0,t3_3fsxdy,B Chapter Requisite desert chapter complete with hidden items strewn across all corners of the map. Bringing two thieves is encouraged. A secret shop to visit too. Other side objective is an interesting one with a statistically supercharged enemy berserker carrying a master sword and a power ring. Because javelins are nerfed in FE managing him safely is difficult. He wont move unless prompted to so this is optional. Ch. introduces flying dragons with a robust fourteentile attack range. On a desert map this is a significant advantage. Also introduced is the barbarian class indirectly strengthened from FEs lack of a weapon triangle their hit rates are passable and their power is deadly. Barbarians are a recurring feature of enemy composition from this point forward.Rescue can be employed as a movement option. Mages who often struggle to keep pace with the front lines enjoy unrestricted movement. They cover twice the ground Marth does. Bishops and sisters can warp Marth to their location. Put three and three together. Players were taught this mechanic back in Ch. so seeing it pop up again is nice.One problem but its a major problem lack of reinforcements. There is simply no reason not to turtle. Barbarians and flying dragons ordinarily strong foes can be safely baited and dealt with. No enemy thieves competing for desert items. New Mystery fails to correct this issue which is surprising. For that reason alone Im inclined to give this map a Terrible rating but I do like the rescue movement option the side objectives and the composition. Weak,fireemblem,ctrnp9w,1,t5_2t0cn

4763562,0,t1_ctuxqhy,The Fire Emblem games have a support system. Specifics vary crom game to game but in Awakening you build support between two characters by having them fight while paired up or standing next to each other having one unit heal another and so on. Once you have built up enough support points you unlock a support rank. You get a conversation between those units at the barracks and the bonus they get from fighting together is increased. Support ranks are C B A and S. S support means two characters become romantically involved. It links the characters ending gives large bonuses in combat and has another benefit I wont spoil. A character can only have one S support but can have many C B or A supports.,fireemblem,ctuzpb6,1,t5_2t0cn

Units like Silas and Oboro want to go to an inferior promotion class for a proc skill then reclass to their more desired class. It isnt to big of a deal for main game purposes and is only really important for multiplayer. Eternal Seals should be more or less disregarded for main game purposes. They are way to expensive and they dont get a whole lot of use for the main game.No going back to the first tiers. You can still pick up the first tier skills though by leveling up in the promoted class.You could if planned it all out.

Tibarn is cool but I dont like him as much as everyone else seems to. I suppose his personality doesnt stand out as much. However he is up against Eirika whose naivete although warranted I dislike. Eliwood. Not my favorite Blazing Sword lord but he does have red hair. Lyon is just a creep. Canas. This is a very tough one because I like both characters but Canas gives us quite a bit of information about the nature of dark magic which I appreciate. Levin. Another character who is quite an asshole Levin stands out in a game without a huge amount of characterization. Hes hardly the only rogue prince who lives as a commoner struggling between his duties and his nature but hes a good character regardless. Black Knight. Joshua may be Levinlite but thats not good enough to beat the most indomitable force of nature that is the Black Knight. Soren. Great characterization and one of the few characters in Fire Emblem who truly changes during the events of the game. Ephraim is a dull character who can practically do no wrong.

4914026,0,t3_3i5s0x,Severa is one of those characters that you either really dislike or really like at least personalitywise. As a unit shes great. Shes actually one of the few kids whos pretty much impossible to screw up in terms of who you marry Cordelia to.Shes one of those characters I tend to go back and forth on honestly. Sometimes I like her sometimes I cant stand her. It really depends on the context. But even though I sometimes hate her I will say that shes not a bad person at all. Her attitude is really just a coping mechanism. She felt as though she had to live up to her mothers perfect standards and she comes from a doomed future where her parents were killed and she was left on her own. Those kinds of things take a toll on a kid.With that said Severa actually does care despite the fact that she acts otherwise. Her supports with Noire and her father show that. Plus look at her reaction to seeing her parents in the Future Past DLC. This is a kid who loves her parents and was forced to grow up too quickly. ,fireemblem,cudy7df,2,t5_2t0cn

4999310,0,t3_3jepul,This probably should be posted in the weekly question thread.Heres a link to a site that gives you all the reinforcements map chest and other misc data.Chapter  spawns soldiers for a long time. So waiting it out isnt a smart idea. A cool trick for the Manster actually pretty much all chapters maps is that enemies prioritize capturing over killing so you can cheese some of the enemies by taking away all items from low bld units like Laura and having enemies capture her to weaken their stats. An easy way to save the NPCs is to have some of your units sit on the stairs as it prevents the soldiers from spawning and then opening the doors so that the civvies have an easier time escaping. Also Lifis can steal thunder tomes from enemy mages so you can disarm them to make them useless.Also you might want to check out uModelOmegas Thracia video seriesLastly dont be afraid to use Leifs light sword. The Manster maps are some of the more difficult maps in the game. In addition if you have the statboosters from previous chapters should be a life ring and spd ring IIRC then give them to Leif.

Which I did. Also Smogon is just as much of a dominant force as VGC. While not officially recognize arbitrary as the definition is Smogon works on a different basis but works pretty much exactly. Touting that one is official and one is not is just elitism. Smogon has tournaments VGC has tournaments. Smogon has cash prizes VGC has cash prizes. Competitant Smogon Players are wellknown.

I wasnt very good at it. Then after a while I got Super Smash Bros. Brawl. I was very interested in who Marth and Ike were and I loved playing as Marth. Looking at their descriptions I found out they were from Fire Emblem and I was like Oh theyre from that game! About a year later I found out about Awakening and I was like Oh wow another Fire Emblem game. Sacred Stones was pretty cool. And is that Marth? I got it within a week of the games release and I was really hooked on it. The game was full of likeable characters and had fun gameplay.

Axes? Only brigands use those. Lances? What are you a Pega Pony Princess? Bows? Oh you are bowlocked now how cute. We are talking about SWORDS here! Also the Makagod cares not for availability after all just dump BEXP on him and watch as his puny enemies fall to his amazing skills. And when the Makagod isnt killing bad guys for fun he is gambling or drinking for fun just like you and me! Truly an inspiration for many.But lets talk about bad characters now. Cormag rides a dragon and wants revenge. That is it. He cant even make out his brothers killer because he is too busy being an idiot with muh revenge muh revenge. Also loyalty to Grado my ass.

5069843,0,t1_cuvym7f,Im not saying you shouldnt heal with Physic while she isnt in timeout clearly you should because she is forced and has very little to do otherwise. Im just saying that in RD you arent relying on Staves the way you are in other games since healing items are powerful and plentiful and no amount of Physic use will really improve Micaiahs stats in any meaningful way. Even if you get her to  by Endgame she isnt really any good aside from the healing that she will be doing anyway and getting middling EXP for. There is no benefit to investing any resources in Micaiah other than Spirit Dust because all of the other mages suck even worse than she does although she does have competition from Sanaki in that they both suck and are both forced and the Endgame Arms Scrolls because no one else will likely care about weapon rank if they are coming to the tower.,fireemblem,cux3vuh,1,t5_2t0cn

However we only get about  lines for them in the entire series which sucks.FE Karel FE Karel is Avery interesting character especially considering his development from  however he has less then three chapters to show his amazing Ness as a character.Renault Lastly we have Chris who is hands down one of the most interesting and well developed personalities and characters in the series but she doesnt have enough screen time.

5167564,0,t1_cv8viwt,Well were evaluating the units with hard mode in mind and as far as longterm investment is concerned theres nothing Lilina offers which Lugh or Niime cant already fulfill. Niime can provide highmagic staff botting and good staff weapon ranks as well as nuke manaketes with Apocalypse while Lugh is a much better and more consistent anima mage for all of the game.Theres no point in trying to argue for Lilinas value when shes invested in if every other unit can fulfil the roles she offers with less effort and more effectively.As for skill books when playing for pure efficiency in beating the game skill items are used on people who will run their stats for the biggest mileage rather than people who are weak in those areas. For example if you staffbot has  skill but high magic theres no point in using a skill book on them as they wont need it for anything. Likewise Lilinas low movement and weak defenses means shell likely get in a tenth of the rounds of combat Marcus Percival or Miledy will and hence not put the skill bonus to as much use. Furthermore a skill book on Lilina is an extra  hit. Even if you used two or three on Lilina her accuracy would sit around the  mark and would only get worse as the game goes on as her skill growth doesnt catch up with the enemies speed and luck growths. Even arguing for stat item investment doesnt do her much good.Bear in mind she still gets shot by almost all physical enemies and rounded by most of them in hard mode on average stats. At the least Lugh is capable of dodgetanking in those scenarios. Lilinas mediocre speed growth means she isnt so lucky.,fireemblem,cv8vre6,6,t5_2t0cn

Yomi should be disregarded he joins with equalworse bases than Mozume and worse growths. He is pretty much the worse unit in the route.In Nohr you have Odin Nyx and Leon. Odin shouldnt stay as a dark mage and should reclass to Samurai. Nyx is made of glass with everything in Mag and Spd. She also has some hit issues. Leon is pretty good. His speed is sorta low but its just high enough where it can easily be boosted up by tonics or Rally to double. In IK you should disregard everyone but Yomi and Leon. Yomi has base stats now but some bulk issues. Leon still has his speed issues. Orochi can nuke generals though which are pretty abundant in the end game.,fireemblem,cv96bwo,2,t5_2t0cn
5170081,0,t1_cv963dl,Jeigans stats are pretty bad all things considered but Shadow Dragon is a game where forged effective weapons can one hit kill just about everything wearing armor or on a horse or at the very least get really damn close to a one hit kill. The enemy density is so low and the majority of enemies are so weak to them that this remains effective for most of the game.Jeigan only needs to be good enough to take the occasional hit and be strong enough to hit them with a forged ridersbane which he can do from the get go. When that stops mattering he isnt a bad staffbot all things considered. His growths and averages are among the least important things about him. For the record Arran can do that too and he isnt bad either.  For comparison Shiida is often considered the best unit in the game largely because her Wing Spear is so good nuking enemies like the ridersbane can.,fireemblem,cv96o9v,6,t5_2t0cn

5224310,0,t1_cvfp1p3,You know Ive been thinking recently..... Lords havent played FE are bad in FE characterwise because of one thing they lack choice. They are heirs of their kingdoms who often find their kingdoms being invaded. Whether or not they want to fight for it or not doesnt matter its their kingdom so it should be in the right and therefore they should fight for it. The closest thing to break this cliche is Ike because he actually had somewhat of a choice on who he will fight for and against. What I want to see is a Lord that knows that hes in the bad side. A Lord that fights for his kingdom even though he doesnt want to. This is the reason why I dont care if Fates Nohr mainly has a relatively black and white morality the very fact that a lord isnt in the happy and good side is very refreshing and the potential for development and character exploration is huge. And even though I havent been keeping up with spoilers on that game because because I most likely wont buy it I heard that my hope will be crushed because hes actually in the good side or whatever. ,fireemblem,cvfpyfr,3,t5_2t0cn

And that is a big part of why its the handsdown worst setting while I am grateful to it for getting things started I would still rather see characters from literally any other FE setting instead.

So alot of people would rather have unlimited supports but unlike Awakening to limit the amount of support partners a character has in other words the whole everyone can support with everyone thing is terrible. ,fireemblem,cvj75ww,1,t5_2t0cn

Way to just judge its not difficult to look up yourself.It seems like a game with Megaten inspired gameplay with mirages which work somewhat similar to persona everyone has their own performa some sort of performance energy when you master it you gain a mirage to my knowledge. The story revolves around an entertainment group Fortuna Entertainment initials are FE if you notice who are defeat the enemes who are also mirages I think? who are stealing peoples performa and making them turn into mindless zombies. There are references everywhere to both series. The DLC outfits are inspired from various Megaten games we have things  such as the Heho mart and a poster with Jack Frost on them. A cashier who looks like Anna and the obvious mirages being FE characters. Enemies inspire from both series from the look of it. The battle system is mostly Megaten but with some FE spins on it such as the lord being strong against enemies with axes but weak to enemies with lances. The Cavalier being strong against axes weak to swords etc. As for it being over the top happy in the first trailer the song actually has very dark lyrics and we see a scene of a destroyed Tokyo building.

5313433,0,t3_3nsc75,To be honest Nowi actually did this for me. Well not from meh because obligatory manakete loli is already a favorite for me just by existing but there is SO much depth to her.She seems like the typical super immature yet is super old archetype but she actually does that completely on purpose. Its to keep peoples spirits high its kind of like when youre sad or angry or scared and you see a cute little puppy just romping around and playing you cant help but smile and feel a little better. Shes like that.And it makes sense as a course of action for her species anyway. I mean unlike Tiki she presumably didnt spend the majority of her life asleep after a certain point of living so very long with such a childlike body in a society that wont really see much past your looks its only logical to just embrace it. Itll keep you sane if anything. Something Im sure Nah will realize eventually...Shes a lot more mature than she lets on after all. Some of her supports show that. And I think shes a FAR more capable mother than any human because shes had so many years of experience and furthermore wont really experience the divide thats inevitable with human children and their parents the natural age gap particularly represented by that of their physical appearances... Although thats mostly just conjecture via extension of logic thats probably how it is for all manaketes after all.But then theres those details about her surprisingly dark backstory. Being taken away from her homeland being sold to slavers at some point in her life... Thats WHY she comes wearing that outfit that everyone rags about after all. And never changes out of it because nobody ever changes clothes in FE clearly... gt.gtAnd Im certain theres plenty more thats never really said. Being a manakete alone in a world of humans... Awakening seems to say that Manaketes are extremely rare now. And Nowi cant go home... Shes had to live her whole life among humans humans who shell always outlive without the benefit of sleeping through those eons like Tiki does without a place to be with her kin like Fa and Myrrh...And yet she still puts on a smile for everyone still does everything she can to seem all upbeat and cheerful. I guess if you let it get to you over that long a life youd be an absolute wreck but all the effort it must take to keep from dwelling on it is surely immense. And she has tremendous respect from me for that.Its hard to really point out a specific moment for it because it takes a lot of putting the pieces together like most Awakening characters do...,fireemblem,cvquqhj,16,t5_2t0cn

From there we learn that Noire has a talent for the dark arts and that Future Tharja didnt teach her anything even though it would be beneficial.

You want to do DewBrigid?  pairing takes  turns of standing next to each other. The remaining chapters of the first generation do not take that long and Dew needs to be fast forwarded in Ch to lower the drawbridge.,fireemblem,cw23nxa,2,t5_2t0cn

5402721,0,t3_3p0v6z,Yes its finally here! Ill happily cover Bartres supports. Also keep in mind that in my opinion these supports are best viewed once you already know about Bartres character in FE. It really shows the theme of growth for Bartres character.Fir. This support definitely shows how much Bartre has grown since FE. In the C and B supports he comes off as a bit of an overprotective father but in his A support we see why. He actually shows regret for his previous focus on nothing but fighting wishing to make up lost time with his daughter. And while Fir still says that she didnt mind the warrior lifestyle of her parents this support is great for showing how much Bartre has matured realizing the mistakes of his life as a warrior with a daughter.Karel. I feel that this is a good support for Bartre although it could be better. Yet it is great for both of them together. Again we see Bartres growth in his regret for his past mistakes as he feels responsible for his inability to keep Karla alive even though it was really beyond his doing. Its also a neat background support as we learn a bit more about Bartre and Karla. I like to think that the first time he avoided Karlas first strike was in Battle Preparations. But what I like most about this one is the dynamic between Bartre and Karel. Both of them are wise old warriors but in such different ways. Most of all though this is just such a human conversation. Its heartwarming.Cath. This one is... interesting. It is technically a background support yes but Bartres reaction to Caths actions and words are what make this one good. He really knows what it means to fight for people to protect them which could tie back to his relationship with Karla or Fir. Again showing so much growth for Bartres character I love it.Gonzalez. Here we see more of the wise old warrior side. To him armor isnt a true measure of strength and he chastises Gonzalez for thinking like that You... IDIOT!!. He shows his wisdom about fighting and the path of a warrior the search for strength is the goal of that path. But I dont really like this one a whole lot mostly due to Gonzalez. In this support he doesnt really contribute too much especially in the A support... seriously all he says is I. Id even prefer ... to what Gonzalez did.Zeiss. This one is really... weird. I feel like Zeisss reactions are what really define this support since he clearly is a bit put off by Bartres mentioning of his daughter or how Bartre thinks of him as an ideal son. Its also a bit more of a support about training so that can make it a bit bad too. Honestly all this makes me think about is the idea of Fir and Zeiss... Yeah Id say that this is the worst.. Karel. Fir. Cath. Gonzalez. Zeiss,fireemblem,cw29a0a,6,t5_2t0cn

You left out a lot of dead people whose death was just not confirmed.But they are dead anyway.The barbecue killed Sigurd Arden Alec Noish Jamka Dew Lex Holyn Beowulf Azel and one female Ayra.There are a couple of backstories which werent used for some characters Azel was supposedly turned to stone Lachesis too.Actually there are four statues probably from Barhara in the room Manfroy Julius Berdo and Ishtar are. They are all dismounted two mageknights male and female a lady swordmaster and a male rider.Probably the male mageknight is Azel which goes well with his halaborted side story and the swordmaster is Ayra. The other mageknight is Lachesis maybe an attempt at make she look licke her actuall class Master Kinght. This would explain why shes not with her children. The rider could be Lex or Beowulf or Noish or Alec.I honestly think they just remained there in Ulster or Larceis ending their mother is never nominated and in general we never know of these people.The fact these statue are them is already a fan teory though surprisingly fitting but we never saw anywer in no ending that one of them comes back.They remained into stone forever.,fireemblem,cwmx0o0,9,t5_2t0cn

Just as planned. evil laughSo Im not sure how many of you guys know this but FE is like my favorite FE so far right next to FE. My favorites change depending on my mood. I dont even know why I like FE. Its so colorful and I love pixel art. Even though FE was my first game I became more addicted to . It may be because I find the gameplay less frustrating I dunno.Had a lot of fun on this piece. Was playing this song as well as a few Undertale and Touhou songs while drawing this. I really like that cover for the FE theme. It not only fits the drawing but it gives me this warm fuzzy Fire Emblem feeling bleh okay Ill stop rambling now. ,fireemblem,cwn9ymt,9,t5_2t0cn

5592655,0,t1_cwqb4wi,Consolation essay because I totally didnt have time to do a real oneIve never done this before. At least not with a girl said Eliwood as he entered Fioras luxurious penthouse apartment overlooking the capital of Ilia. The smell of pure undiluted testosterone was nearly overpowering although Eliwood was determined to continue through towards what he imagined would be the most intense physical pleasure he had ever experienced. Fiora just nodded and motioned Eliwood towards the trapdoor to the beejatorium. It was gonna be one hell of a Tuesday night.Eliwood opened the trapdoor only to reveal a staircase covered in the finest velvet leading into the darkness below. The strains of Passage to Bangkok wafted through the air played by the stereo system on Fioras private helicopter which was stationed just outside the window to the apartment hovering waiting. Eliwood began to head down the stairs but quickly stopped when he realized that Fiora was no longer behind him. Eliwood looked around the room and quickly found Fiora relaxing on a fur chaise longue just below the crystal chandelier slowly applying layer upon layer of her vanity brand of lip balm Transient Decadence. Now it was Eliwoods turn to beckon Fiora who put the cover on her lip balm and placed it prominently in her front right pocket so that the outline of its hard cylindrical plastic case formed a delicate protuberance visible through the waist fringes of her professionally tailored leather pants. Fiora fixed her gaze on Eliwood slowly rose up out of the chaise and playfully yet brusquely pushed Eliwood down the stairs in a way that was initially not cool but gradually became cool. As Eliwood tumbled down the velvet a sly smile crept across his face as he realized that this evening was going to be about one thing and one thing alone Him.Next darkness.Eliwood awoke slowly. He could not tell how much time had passed. Perhaps only seconds but possibly hours. Although Eliwoods eyes had not yet adjusted to the darkness around him he could sense movement. The stench of pegasussweat assaulted his tender nostrils in much the same way that he would soon have his junk assaulted by Fioras eager probing mouth. He could still faintly hear Rush playing in the darkness but the song had moved on to a live version of Tom Sawyer which the band had played at Fioras celebrityfilled th birthday party held on international waters on a chartered yacht captained by supermodels. As his limbs brushed against thread count satin velvet sheets Eliwood realized that he was in Fioras custommade solid oak bed. Somebody must have gently placed him there while unconscious and although he had no memory of the event Eliwood appreciated the tender way in which he had been tucked in stripped of all his clothes given a fullbody shave rubbed down with white rose petals and patted dry.Suddenly the sound of freshly moistened lips smacking together rang through the darkness and a shadow approached the bedside. It was Fiora and she was carrying the glowinthedark lotion sampler given to her by President Obama a personal friend.I see youre already hard winked Fiora. Good. Youll be needing that.Slowly yet violently Fiora placed her perfectly manicured right hand on the sheet covering Eliwood and ripped it off the bed throwing it so that it landed in a perfectly folded pile next to the extensive collection of erotic Grecian sculpture Fiora acquired on one of her many allexpenses paid trips to Europe. Fiora squirted an inappropriately large amount of lotion into her velvety grabby palms. Eliwood softly moaned with anticipation boredom or one of his many other irrelevant and uninteresting emotions. Fiora brusquely slapped her lotionfilled hands onto Eliwoods hairy unflattering thighs and slowly began to rub in small circular motions while whispering the lyrics to the Journey song Any Way You Want It which Fiora had ghost written by herself with no help. As Eliwoods thighs got moister and moister Fioras hands worked their way up into Eliwoods poorly maintained manbush. And just as Fiora was about to take a oneway trip to Sacktown she paused.IT IS TIME! screamed Fiora slamming her open mouth onto Eliwoods erect and unimpressive Durandal.Eliwood passed out from pleasureterrornobody cares and so it began.. million years later Eliwood awoke on the surface of Gropinius IV in the Butt system. Robot Fiora was asleep on top of him her metal mouth surrounding Eliwoods stillerect and stillnotveryimpressive blazing sword.What happened? asked Eliwood stupidly scratching his dumb face. Whwhere are we?Robot Fiora awoke with a start and began to speak in a metallic commanding voice not unlike that of a young Benedict Cumberbatch if he had been a robot or whatever.Eliwood many eons have now passed since first I began to beej you. As you may well imagine the beej started out amazingly. Although you were asleep your body was racked with pleasure as my human mouth began to expertly work its way around your pallid distasteful sword. I did every thing a woman could do to a man including stuff I had to look up online because I had never heard of it because it was too gross. And despite all my mouth efforts you slept. Cities rose and fell and still you slept. All of human consciousness was uploaded to a vast database and our bodies were replaced by superior synthetic ones and still you slept. And even once I had robot hands and used them to rub you all over especially in ways I know would not have been cool with you had you been awake still you slept. As Elibe blew up for some reason I carried you to the final escaping starship my mouth all the while on your disgusting blade and took you here to the most distant human colony. As I continued to work you over still you slept. And gradually after every other member of the human race had gone the pace at which my mouth was bobbing up and down on your eager boring shaft slowed. And then I slept.Robot Fiora paused and stood.And now said Robot Fiora metal hands held aloft in triumph I shall finish you off.Eliwood gasped in pleasure or something as Robot Fiora threw herself towards Eliwoods gross junk. Using exactly the perfect amount of mouth friction Robot Fiora brought Eliwood to the brink of ecstasy. And then stopped.And once again stood.Just kidding bro! laughed Robot Fiora. Id never give you a REAL beej. Thatd be gross! HIGH FIVE!As Robot Fiora reached out her hand for an amazing high five Eliwood died and the human race died with him.Well that wasnt very cool of him thought Robot Fiora to herself as she began masturbating into the sunset. That wasnt cool at all.,fireemblem,cwqbkug,12,t5_2t0cn

Even the last one is still arguably in character as even Severa still thinks Cordelia has some kind of Chromplex so clearly it takes her more time than she wants to let on before she gets over him.I just finished my copy of Make Him Fall for You in a Fortnight. So embarrassing... she could just really like reading the book and finds it a guilty pleasureI have more dreams than I can count but I know some are not meant to be. Could be interpreted as her starting to accept that her and Chrom arent happening and moving onNo Chrom... The thing I like is just a bit further out of reach. This one is still problematic but could just be a case of old feelings being stirred up since they are so close. Maybe it could be that she doesnt truly move on until after the war is over and she can be away from Chrom or shes just married to Frederick,fireemblem,cwsx9up,3,t5_2t0cn

I had no one inherit Verdane so it was incorporated into Granvale under Seliphs rule which I actually thought was nice and fitting since all its endings say Sigurd and Deirdre have mythical status in Verdane. Faval inherited Jungby and the only one who went with him is Lester so I guess I got my samesex pairing after all. Bam bow boyfriends.,fireemblem,cwthg68,2,t5_2t0cn

5618543,0,t3_3s2p9t,Huge black wall of text incomingsorry wasnt sure of a better way to do it. But I wanted to post my FE map endings now that Ive found them.Thracias At long last Thracia has been unified.  A region once swamped with countless small nations constantly warring among themselves with the restoration of House Leonster and the downfall of the Thracian kingdom the Thracian Peninsula finally knows peace. And as the first ruler of this new Thracia the people ardently desired for the throne to be taken by Leif.And so Leif worked together with Nanna Leifs wife Finn the lance knight and General Hannibal to build a new nation for Thracias people.  At Leifs behest the old Thracias former lands were entrusted to his sister Altena. Legends tell of Altenas love for and dedication to the very land that raised her and this love never died so long as she lived.The Thracian peninsula thus gave rise to a new realm the Kingdom of New Thracia.Question for lore experts whats the overlapdifference between Old and New Thracia? As for the ending itself it seems like these folks all got what they wanted.Isaacs The Kingdom of Isaac may have found its freedom from Imperial abuse the quickest yet its people could not rest easy while its heir was absent fighting in the war. This changed with the final victory of the liberation army and when Shanan returned from battle the people greeted their liege with raucous cheers.  And so with Shanan assuming the crown Scathach by his side to restore the land they also strove for a new age of diplomacy and trade seeking to build a wealthy nation.  Isaac was once reviled by others as little more than a barbarous eastern land but under the reign of Shanan Isaac will grow like never before and shall one day be reborn as a mighty nation every bit the equal of other realms.Double bro kings!Agustrias The aftermath of Agustrias civil war left it to be annexed by Grannvale and so the land fell to harsh tyranny.   After years of abuse its people dearly wished for the rise of a unified nation one led by House Nordion heirs of the legendary hero Eldigan. And so the people eagerly welcomed the homecoming of Ares. In Ares the people saw the very same aura Eldigan himself bore in his youth.  Ares was accompanied home by Leen his wife Delmud the charming knight and Lana Dermotts wife and worked with them to unite Agustria. Under the reign of Ares Agustria will soon become Grannvales most significant partner and will grow to be greater than ever before.Satisfied with the group that ended up here too.Verdanes Even at its peak the Empire had shunned and ignored Verdane. Uninterested in seizing the region within its iron fist it completely abandoned the old kingdom. Instead Verdane was left to the mercy of constantly warring clans and brigands ran rampant. Nobody had any hope of peace.  With the holy wars end Seliph led an expedition to restore peace to Verdane. The people were overjoyed to at last be saved by Seliph the son of Deirdre. Deirdre had long since passed into the legends and folklore of Verdane now revered there as a saint and now Verdanes people clamored to come under the rule of Deirdres son. Seliph too held a deep love for the land of his mothers youth and so Verdane joined Grannvales lands becoming the Royal Province of Verdane.  Verdane is a land of natural beauty.  Its verdant forests are Sigurds prayers...  Its sparkling crystalclear water is Deirdres tears...  And these are its peoples emblems of hope and faith... My only heirless region but this ending makes sense to me.Silesias Silesia had long dwelt under the empires cruel hand and so Sety devoted his life to rebuilding the ruined land bearing a hopefilled smile.A stunning land... A peaceful people... Lewyn had devoted his life to protecting the Kingdom of Silesia and at long last his decades of work came to fruition.Forever alone but he doesnt mind. Hes used to soloing everything he comes acrossGranvales And in Grannvale itself  Velthomers new lord Arthur and his wife Patty  Freeges new lord Tinny  Eddas new lord Corpul  Dozels new lord Johalva and his wife Larcei  Jungbys new lord Faval and Lester  Chalphys new lord Oifey  returned to their new homes.  In the royal capital Valhalla itself with overwhelming support from the public Seliph was officially hailed as their king. The newly anointed King Seliph devoted himself to rebuilding his land and bringing peace to all his goal nothing short of an affluent world free of oppression and bigotry.  And by his side one would always find his loving eversmiling wife Queen Fee...  His sister Princess Julia regarding his toil with the warmest of eyes...In ages to come the people of Jugdral tell legends of a divine king of ages past. None shall ever forget his name Seliph.FinSo I guess I inadvertently paired up Faval and Lester...xD Anyway Im bummed that so many female characters got shafted out of having endingsinheritances independently of their lovers and brothers. It almost reminds me of Awakening grafting all the wife endings onto the husbands templates. Doing it by country is cool and I guess there were a ton of contingencies they couldnt accountwrite unique endings for. But it wouldve been nice.Heres the Arank special text which Im sure I didnt get because I had an embarrassing turn count though Im not sure exactly what it was but posting anyway because its kinda coolAranks Kindness... to know the sorrow of men.

How can Jan be certain their powers are weakened and wont cause this? Other than for plot convenience why does the Sealed Sword have the power to preserve memories of past wielders and return souls to dragon girls?

As to the others theyre mostly okay but feel like a step down from Awakenings. Now this could just be due to Matt Mercer Laura Bailey and Kate Higgins who pretty much dominated the majority of animated cutscenes just being extremely good at their job but other than Ryoma and Sakura  and the little teensy bits of Leo and Camilla  none of the family members are really that great sounding. However Azura was astounding. That was a great performance and one that could easily sit up there with Laura Baileys work in Awakening.

So in that sense I dont want MarthRobin to be playable.Because of Robins self insert nature I doubt hell be featured at all although he has featured in other games.Marth however could be a villain wouldnt it be interesting if he was the final boss?If anything though I am glad Chrom is the protags mirage because Chrom has been ignored far too much feels like hes not given the credit as Awakenings lord as much as he deserves.

6038997,0,t3_3y7k8d,So I just preordered my special edition last week at gamestop. I had been in  separate times before that trying to preorder with no success.  The rd time I told the guy behind the counter that its crazy because I keep seeing it back in stock online and when I make it to the store its gone.   So this lovely gamestop employee took my cell phone number and told me hed call if it came back and save me a copy.  Last Thursday he called and told me it was back up and to come in.  Now heres where the story get amazing.I was waiting in line to preorder and the guy  spots ahead of me asked to preorder fates.  They told him they were sorry but it wasnt available anymore.  My heart sank and I was starting to think hope was lost.  But the cashier recognized me and motioned me to come over to him.  He told me that he put down  bucks on my game to make sure atleast one copy was available for me.  I was absolutely stunned and extremely happy I paid the rest in full and tried to tip him but he said he couldnt take it.  Then he changed the preorder to my name and left his employee discount on it.  This was the first time in my life I asked to see someones manager. I gave him as much praise as I could and left extremely happy.Moral is this special edition is a pain in the ass to preorder.  But maybe youll just get lucky.,fireemblem,cyb8377,7,t5_2t0cn

Its Nintendo taking their own product and editing it to better appeal to a wider western audience. If they thought their target demographic wanted those things they would leave them in the game.

Its difficult to explain so try watching this video to get an idea of some of the things you can do.That LP helped me to realize Lunatic is not chancebased you just have to look for the right strategy. Other than readingwatching guides and LPs practice and youll get better at it.,fireemblem,cyjygft,9,t5_2t0cn

But seriously he willingly took up Armads while knowing the consequences so having a child with that knowledge that youre likely going to leave them alone at a time when they need you most is a pretty irresponsible thing to do.Chrom is a pretty good dad. I think his Inigo support highlights it best and really fits his personality. Hes kind of a hardass on his kids because he knows they have one hell of a destiny to live up to but also cares deeply for them and has a lot of compassion.Lissa is definitely the most motherly character in Awakening and pretty high up there for the entire series. Shes kind of the only Awakening girl who genuinely acts like a mom rather than a big sister in her support with her kid unconditionally loving and supporting her weirdass son even though she doesnt really understand him.For most parents who die I feel like they should kind of be disqualified but I think Greil deserves an exception. He does his damndest to make the best of a really dark and dire situation and against all odds manages to create some semblance of a happy life and family support structure as a single parent for not only his two children but many more who he takes under his wing. He knows Ike is inevitably going to have to face the consequences of his own past but does everything he can to ensure his son will be strong enough to bear that burden and ends up raising a man who is every way his equal in terms of both fighting ability and strength of character.

I wish you would have made Canas holding the book instead of levitating it purely from a practice standpoint. Hands are weird and difficult to draw but it would have been great to see an attempt at drawing him holding the book to try different hand styles than relaxed or fists.

However when used optimally she allows for a phenomenal amount of strategic flexability. If we arent evaulating turns saved specifically and just efficiency speed divided by reliability then Tethys is one of the best contributors towards that whilst she exists regardless of composition but because of her dependance on other units she should be marked down out of the highest tiers. Tana has flying utility but her meh jointime on top of her meh bases and meh level flying utility means she just isnt that great in the grand scheme of things. In fact you can leave Tana unpromoted and still have her do flying utility things really.Arturs only real specific role is to Warp later on because combat wise he isnt notably good for most of the game. However like Tethys he depends on the units hes Warping in order for this to actually be useful so we can say hes worse than the independant units.I agree with a general hierarchy that seperates individual units based on what types of units they are but rather than just describing the functionality of the units I think it also needs to be put contextually.Like Seth requires nothing to be dominant and increases efficiency drastically just by being deployed.Tethys is not dominant herself but does not require any resources in order to enable other units to do amazing things.Artur has workable combat throughout the game but requires a fair amount of resources and effort to reach ORKOing status and his promotion in order to fufill his lifelong goal. That goal also relies on other units in order for amazing things to happen.Tana has workable combat but any effort put into raising her doesnt really have a significant payoff and she definitely requires work in order to be good.I feel pretty confident in Seth gt Tethys gt Artur gt Tana.,fireemblem,cyzj03c,6,t5_2t0cn

6271129,0,t1_cz2fxri,Aaaah but I would argue that in some cases lack of evidence is itself a manner of evidence.Its a question of perspective really. Does the fact that the Binding Shield no longer perform its original function a matter of no consideration being given to it or something that is a deliberate and noteworthy setting detail?I fully admit that the first seems more likely to be the actual intent but as I said earlier the theory relies on trying to incorporate everything in Awakening not dismissing it.With regards to the second Loptyr needs to get a body from somewhere and after the events of FE hes most likely sealed away in the Dragons Altar with all the other Earth Dragons. After all he escaped that fate the first time by having a physical vessel and being on another continent. Well hes right out of vessels his spirit wasnt properly sealed away so its probably still active so I think theres at least a decent chance that he floats along back home to Archanea.But all that extra stuff is largely beside the point  The core of the matter is that Grima is really Loptyrlike but Loptyr is loooong since out of a body and hes sure as hell not just going to be able to conjure one up out of nothingness. That and Loptyrs old body was assuredly not the ginormous eldritch abomination that Grima is. If Grima is Loptyr Loptyr still had to get that new body from somewhere.,fireemblem,cz2ggw1,1,t5_2t0cn

If you do pair him hell lose all his weapons and gets a new Steel Lance with zero stars making it much more difficult to use him. It was probably because I was terrible at leveling the parents but neither Leif nor Nanna could damage the knights that spawn near the trio while Finn could do decent damage. If he had the Brave Lance he could had easily killed the knights and promoted by the end of the chapter and would definitely had been a solid member of my main team.

6313739,0,t1_cz5exx0,A more in depth explanation is needed. On Lunatic mode character growths are fixed at spawn and can only be reseeded changed by respawning that character. For instance Belka has predetermined growths from the moment she joins in turn  in chapter  but she will have a different fixed growth string every time you reset chapter  and she joins all over again. For characters that dont join mid chapter each time you complete the chapter before their recruitment their growth string is changed. For example Saizou joins in chapter  of Hoshido and has a fixed growth string from that point onwards. However every time you complete chapter  he gets a difference growth string.On non lunatic modes you can just reset if you get a bad level up. If Saziou gains HP and Luck on a level up you can just reset and get that level again for a different level up.,fireemblem,cz7avwg,1,t5_2t0cn

6395306,0,t3_439oge,K picking one is really hard so Ill just talk about a fewThe route split while kinda screwy on a plotlevel is still really cool because you get  entire FE games that use Fates gameplay which is the most fun in the series imo. Sure theres a few reused maps but most of those are different enough between versions that it doesnt bug me too much i.e. one boat map being a flier invasion and one being a traitor hunt sorta thing.. I love screwing around in My Castle. Having a base where you can move around customize stuff and interact with your party is really fun. I love it sooo much ahahThe new seals and promotion system is great. You can get a character a skill from one class and move back to your old class without having to reset to level  both times. Marriage seals are also really helpful because youll probably be marrying most of your units so it just opens up that units class and skill options.Dragons Vein is really fun. Making the maps have dynamic terrain is really cool and Conquest makes really good use of DV.I really like unbreakable weapons. It makes it so that I dont have to constantly spend money to replace stuff but more importantly it makes the weapons you can get from enemieschests wayyyy more valuable because you can keep using them for the rest of the game. The negative stats are kinda sucky but the pros outweigh the cons.holy shit I love this game,fireemblem,czgkwn0,1,t5_2t0cn

6530699,0,t3_4522z4,Everybody has been talking about the fighters from FE on but nobody mentioned the earlier ones!The Shadow DragonShin Monsho fighters are all pretty good not quite sure how they are in the originals because FE is the only game I havent played but in general are better when reclassed. Cord in particular is one of the only units that should ever be considered for reclassing to Sorcerer due to most units in that class set having garbage mag growth understandably. Of the three Barst is definitely best though he is outclassed by several other units.Johalva from Geneaology is actually quite good but he is of course worse than most children characters. His higher stats are also outweighed by his brothers superior movement which is more important in FE than in any other game in the series due to the huge scale of the maps. If you do a playthrough with only sub characters though he will be one of your better units in the second half of the game.In Thracia the fighters are actually quite good. Orsin is without a doubt one of the strongest units in the game due to his good stats high PCC and his own personal weapon. Halvan is usable as well but inferior to Orsin. He is needed to get the Brave Axe though which can then be given to a better unit if you dont want to use him. Dagdar and Marty are is pretty shitty but very useful for capturing.Edit Dagda is actually quite useful but being a Jeigan unit his growths are garbage. With some scrolls he can be very good but so can everyone.,fireemblem,czutqre,2,t5_2t0cn

6552510,0,t1_czx1r0s,the Team Symphonia system has a base arte gt advanced arte gt arcane arte combo system but it feels a lot less restrictive than having to just... stop and wait for your CP to regenerate while you do nothing like in Zestiria.Not just spamming the best artes is along the lines of preferring not to just cheese a FE game with juggernaut units. Not using the weakness system is akin to trying to play a FE game... The closest match I can think of is ignoring the weapon triangle but thats just a  or so hit drop whereas ignoring weaknesses in Zestiria will invariably result in getting curbstomped because nothing except for spamming their weakness will flinch the enemy or even deal more than like  damage.Vesperias While it sucks that the vigilanteism plot got dropped it still left me with the impression while it was still there that it was a sort of low point in Yuris career and that it was very much trying to portray what he was doing as a bad thing even if it was understandable. That goes a long way for me.Anyways I just hate Malevolence in general because its just sort of a beall endall removal of any moral agency from... pretty much everyone! Villains? Its not their fault the malevolence made them do it! Sorey and co? They dont have to worry about what theyre doing theyre just beating up monsters and turning them human again  in fact if they worry about the moral greyness of literally anything BAM! Theyll get possessed too! Even when they decide to intervene in the war its not because they feel that they should use the Shepherds power to end it quickly or anything and theres no real moral debate over it  its just If Alisha dies Soreyll blame himself and thatll turn him eeeeeeeeeevil! Malevolence makes it basically impossible to tell a story with any sort of interesting moral questions like have been in pretty much every other Tales game since Phantasia.,fireemblem,czx30e9,1,t5_2t0cn

Thankfully buildings like those are optional so its easier to avoid than the goddamn sparkle tiles in FE.

6719778,0,t1_d0edhqa,I will object on a few pointsKorras  Your first sentence is very subjective and I gave a decent amount to state that there was cause for growth in Mako but it was left out. Makos growth was stunted in order to make way for Korrasami. His final bit of character WAS devotion to the avatar. This would have been better expressed by him at least confessing his love to the Avatar. He was more changed in personality in the final season this much is very evident.Korras You cite Asami having growth but fail to realize that non of those points are character growth and a few of them can be applied to Mako whom you said had no growth. Those things you mentioned are not development of character. You just listed what happened to her. Asami from the beginning has the same amount of flaws as Asami from the end. None. Largely a character with no negative aspects she has experiences in her life and while she meets some change towards the end she is incredibly static. So you cant just cite things that happened to her as growth. Those are just what happened to her.Korras Heres the thing Korra isnt defined by her ending relationship. She just isnt. Her culmination was with Kuvira. The only person to benefit from a relationship is a partner. Mako needed that culmination in order to fit his own personal arc whereas Korra doesnt care if she has a partner in order for her character. The resulting relationship was be beneficial for Mako character but wouldnt do anything to Korras charcter because it was wrapped up beforehand. It might even be a sign of maturity that Korra can even forgive Mako. Korra wouldnt be static because this doesnt define her character and her character is culminated elsewhere and Mako has nothing to gain. Obviously this stands to be a better option.,fireemblem,d0edt3y,1,t5_2t0cn

With an immediate reclass to Archer I found her able to contribute just fine on chapter .  She could double quite a few units with the Raider Yumi and could double almost everything but the Samurai in Chapter  and that alongside a good attack stance partner killed things just fine.  And thats before getting Quick Draw.Wasnt even that annoying to train on her paralogue.  Lure attackers as you progress towards the boss with a tanky unit finish them off with Mozu utilizing attack stance which also helps mitigate the loss of experience on your other units.

However to your other point there would be a lot of xp missed if you do it that way. My strategy was bring mostly Lance Users had them armed with Javelin. At the end of each turn I tried to have a ranged attack on a faceless either using Leos magic attack Bow Knight with Niles or a Javelin to soften up the Faceless and on the character I wanted to level up it was Peri for me at the time I equipped her with Blessed Lance which deals an absurd amount of damage to monsters. She should be able to take on any Faceless that is at  hp on her own.It just so happened I wanted to level a Lance user Blessed Lance makes the killing easy. But yeah theres a lot of exp to be had there and its very much a risk vs reward situation. Rescue staffs would have made this super awesome to grind  escape but thats a Birthright Rod shop thing. So if you REALLY wanted the exp visit a Player castle thats Hoshido with level  Rod Shop buy a few Rescue Staffs. Have your Rod user run all the way to the end leave behind the guy you want to level and kill stuff. Rescue when you really cant hold on anymore and escape Edit Blessed Lance is an item acquired from visiting one of the houses in the Chapter where Scarlett shows up I cant remember the number.

This is especially true later in the game when the player will have accumulated enough tools to skip more side objectives without consequence.

6786589,0,t1_d0lijg7,Just as an aside you might want to spoiler tag a certain name in that comment.gt There is only character universally available through both hypothetical gay pairings Kana however the main aspect of Kanas character in her joining chapter is the fact that heshe is a noble dragon and thus is a direct descendant of the AvatarI think this is where a lot of the disconnect between those who want the gay couples to have kids and those who see it as unrealistic lies  that the current child mechanic relies on a system where a childs stats skills and classes are based on their two biological parents.  And the side that finds it unrealistic for two men or two women to create a child through this specific game mechanic is correct in this situation it would be very strange for Kana to show up with M!Corrins and Niles stats and their special skills in particular Corrins ability to become a dragon.  Personally I would also find including a biological child of two men or two women odd but thats me  I dont speak for anyone else in this fandom or the LGBT gaming community.The main argument from the gay couples should also have kids side is that it would not be a farstretch for these couples to either  have a surrogate parent help or  adopt a different child under these circumstances.  Like you said the first option is trickier to work with and it would almost certainly result in child units that are statistically not as good as the others such as Villager!Lucina being a pretty bad option.  However this is based on the current child mechanic  if IS modified the mechanic in future games they could maybe make this option work.Which brings me to option two which is in my opinion the best option so far.  Adopting and foster families are not unheard of in Fire Emblem  in fact a major theme of Fates is the nature of family and if it is decided by blood or bond.  Past games such as Genealogy and the Tellius games also dealt heavily with these themes and weve seen psuedofamilies like the Greil Mercenaries Micaiah and Sothes relationship Tormod and Muarims relationship Rolf and Tauroneos supports etc.  It would not be difficult to justify a gay couple adopting an orphan ingame.The mechanic would have to be modified since the child unit would essentially be their own character.  Ingame dialogue could mention that this child character learned certain skills because one parent taught them locktouch.  This is where the sort of laziness thats been brought up comes in  IS has actually written substitute characters for a second generation in a past game so it isnt like the idea isnt new to them.  And in a game with lots of playable units including unique capturable bosses and bond units it gets a little frustrating to see arguments about cutting costs come up.gt The main takeaway and this is my personal feelings while there spots that sort of address homophobia make it present in Fire Emblem the fact remains that they included it in the first place which do note is MILES ahead of any other game in the series. Can we expect it to get better in the future? Probably. Can we lament that it hasnt happened sooner? Definitely. Can we gripe that it isnt enough. Sure. But progress is being made and progress doesnt happen overnight. Fates is probably just the beginning.I agree with this and Ive said in the past that Im actually very proud of the fact that IS and Nintendo took this official first step in terms of samesex marriage in Fire Emblem and I know that many other fans feel the same way as me.  At the same time we can also recognize that this step forward is hindered by a Japanese company that is very behind the times in pretty much everything not just social stuff and by a development team that goes the extra step for some stuff three whole new games in three years is amazing I wont discredit that but struggles to put that polish on other aspects not just the samesex supports but the plots the character development the child mechanic in general just to name a few.  For me personally I see the problems with the samesex supports as being part of these larger issues of gameplay and story so while Im still very happy theyre in I talk about them a lot because they are still worthy of discussion.,fireemblem,d0ljplz,6,t5_2t0cn

6813563,0,t3_491y61,The supports arent difficult to grind but if you dont go out of your way to pair characters from the start it can take a very long time. The amount of points you need from A to S rank is rather absurdly high even on birthright it can take two maps of soloing with a pair to get them from A to S.You can grind supports via DLC castle battles and forcing fights. You just cant get anything else in them if you really want to grind up your supports thats the best bet. Probably you should make a plan to have certain characters be your central force when doing paralogues as well it should make it easier to get children units if you use the actual children unit maps to grind for supports.As for promotion if you dont feel that you are gaining enough excperience then early promoting is fine because if you dont reach the level cap  on pre and postpromote the extra stats really arent going to make much of a difference. However if you use the same core team it should not be difficult at all to have them all promote around the same time which if youre pacing yourself properly should be around when enemies start dropping lots of master seals.,fireemblem,d0om50a,2,t5_2t0cn

I dislike SumiaChrom but Id do it each time for this ray of sunshine. . Panne Shes kind of archtypical I supoose but shes just such?? A good person?? Shes honest and blunt and uncaring but honorable and proud. She doesnt always seem like a good friend but shes always dependable and steadfast. Bitches get shit done yo. . Laurent Is it a or e? Who knows. Still. Argghh he just deserves so many nice things. So many. All the nice things. To be honest I dont recall his supports as vividly as others barring his with Lucina so I cant elucidate as well.. Gregor good dad good friend yes? He seemed like a really nice chill dude. He was just pretty heartwarming. Like him loads with Cordelia I am alone in this shipQuick rundown for the next five. . Lissa. Olivia. Henry. Maribelle I love love love how great of a person she is. I want to be a Maribelle when I am older.. Brady. OwainSpecial shout out to Miriel though just because I think people should appreciate her and her fam as well as Gaius my my husband.

If youre playing Conquest with limited funds you can save on seals if you recruit them then.That said the paralogues scale with each chapter so they might become too difficult to complete by later in the game. Therefore my recommendation is to get the kids you really want to use early so that that you can build their weapon levels and supports. Then when youre cleaning up the rest of the kids you can save them for later when you have strong units and you can promote them easily. Also do a paralogue if you need extra levels on your main team since they offer exp in Conquest.,fireemblem,d0q8ryv,2,t5_2t0cn

Some even thinking that the fantranslation is better when in all honesty the localization has put more effort than us fantranslation team in making the characters have more well characterArgument from emotion argument from hard work. Both are fallacious. Id say you should have more confidence if youre part of the team that is a few thousand people are enjoying your fan translation more than the inaccurate localization.Giving them more character is basically changing their personality but if you think thats good and all then you have no respect for the official writers and creators.gtExcluding Saizo x Beruka Csupport since that was an unfortunate accident on their part. Pretty sure its translated but they forgot to add it in and the ... were just placeholdersFalse there are  lines of dialogue in the original Japanese and only  ellipses. They also change facial expressions at the end. Clearly showing that it was intentional. Placeholders dont work that way you either have  placeholders the original JP text or just blank boxes.gt Sure there are some that are hit or miss but that doesnt mean ours doesnt have any. We have LOTS of stuff that needs to be ironed out. Were not pros dammit. sighNo one said you are but you clearly did a better job. Theyve went out of their way to shit on the original writers.gtIf Awakening had a fantranslation with literal translations like the one in Fates I have no doubt people would complain the same exact stuff Fates is currently getting.I doubt it.gtStop being entitled you idiots.

In that case one main way to get exp is to have them spam heals on anyone missing any hp regardless of how much they are missing. ex another character just got  hp for a level up? Time for exp from healing You get more exp for healing higher level units so that could also help. Its definitely doable... in FE Fates Conquest I spammed heals on Elise and she was the first of my units to promote at level  lol. Their promoted classes can start using weapons again so that helps a lot.Alternatively I know from personal experience that Azamas stat growths actually want him to be a physical combat unit.

Miriel could go Nostank and her awful Def would never matter.Its different in Fates. Their bases are almost the same and only a single story chapter separates them. Enemy quality is much worse with classic defensetanking being viable. Hayato becomes very bulky and gets a strong enemy phase with investment similar to Rinkah.So similar startupinvestment cost  much better returns on investment  Hayato is better.Of course winning the Better than Orochi award is nothing to write home about but its something I think needs to be said when its taken for granted that Orochi is better.And Im not even trying to trash Orochi here.

6912277,0,t1_d0zs9sl,What Im trying to get across is that I think the investments are being overstated. Orochis main flaw is her speed. Her squishiness can be mended by Basara promotionfriendship sealing Rinkah. Since speed has been such a big factor in FE so far I think people tend to write off units who are bad in it unless theyre on a horse or have a high speed base or some other third thing and I think thats whats happening here. But as you yourself said enemy quality is so low and the things needed to let Orochi double are so easily obtainable that coupled with her overkill mag in Birthrout is what pushes her over the edge for me if we determine it by those precedents.I think the balance is great in Birthright too and thats why Im not as hard on Hayato as I use to be after giving him an honest try. I just think the problems Orochi has and the results Hayato has in return arent enough to qualify each of them.

Part of is that the Fire Emblem games probably dont take place within the same universe so they dont necessarily follow the same rules. Although generally Dark Magic by itself isnt necessarily thought of as evil.Appearances is one thing but descriptions are another. By those rules the Good classes found in Nohr like Hero and Paladin should also be noted. And on that note so should the Evil Hoshido classes like Master Ninjas and Oni Chieftain.Ninja leaders. They execute targets with their shurikens and katanas.Those who have transcended to become a demongod.

7064898,0,t3_4cd324,Small update to my lunatic PMU Here are the screensThis update is small since Im still stuck on Chapter . When I first started it Hana was absolutely useless in that she couldnt damage anyone the chapter after you get her no less!. So I decided to grind her up a small bit. Too rounds of Boo Camp got her to level  which is where I stopped.Even now shes fairly useless she can only double the lancers and Oni Savages but cant finish either in one round and then also takes enough damage that she gets oneshotted by anything that moves. Even Nina SR cant kill the Onis in one round. The ninjas never attack from a range that Nina SR can retaliate so they can only be hit on player phase but their ranged weapons mean I cant get the drop on them. This chapter is excruciatingly annoying and difficult with only two usable units neither of whom have any healing capabilities.The only way for Nina SR to be able to survive multiple rounds is to use the dragonstone which as we all know cant double which still doesnt kill units in one hit. Because this map has healers enemies will disengage combat to go get healed so I can kill up to one enemy per turn assuming I dont pop a vulnery then there are reinforcements. To make matters even worse I have to keep Rinkah alive as shes been destined to marry Ryoma. Initially this seemed impossible but Ive managed to do well by simply pairing her up with Wingboy Tsubaki and keep them out of reach.Oh! Fuga also has fucking seal strength! And hes on a throne  avoid. So far Ive made it like  turns before getting overwhelmed. Ill give it a couple of more attempts before I try grinding a few more levels worse comes to worse I might have to use some bonus stat items on Hana.Edit this is extremely frustrating and infuriating how bad of a map this is. After  turns its become clear that Fuga is basically impossible to kill in close combat but rather cheesed thru ranged combat. Neither of my Hana nor Nina SR have that option. I guess Ill keep going until I run out of healing items just a partial vulneray and a couple of concoctions at this point.Edit   turns is how far I made it before running out of curatives. I fucking hate this chapter. Now I have to do it AGAIN. le sigh Somehow I need to get a ranged weapon.Edit  sophisticated bread and tonics to the rescue! But now I have some dragon tonics to use.

Just look at what Corrin says the beginning of chapter . He says to himself that MAYBE Garon actually DIDNT order Hans to kill the rest of the villagers which is dumb on his case. It could just be Hans being a crazy little turd. Even at the end of chapter  Corrin is doubting Garon.  Its clear that if Corrin finds out that Garon actually DID order Hans to kill the villagers Corrin would lose faith in his father.It is only when Garon FINALLY admits right in front of Corrin that he ordered Hans to do it that Corrin realizes oh shit man. My father really IS crazy! See? This is the beginning and end of Chapter . Right after the Cyrkensia chapter. Even without the stupid crystal ball Corrin says Should I have sided with Hoshido?

Technically you can beat  without using limiteduse staves albeit with a bit of effort. But for the Endgame you basically need access to Rescue which you couldve used up in error earlier andor some combination of Pass  multiple fliers when you could just as easily be at this point without them. I feel like I lucked out by happening to have most of these on my mostly blind first run otherwise I wouldve probably locked myself out of actually beating the game. I suppose its always possible to lock yourself out of beating an FE game if you let enough units die but I felt like the Endgame was overly restrictive.

7211494,0,t1_d1xv5s8,Some notes I wrote down for magic basically involved each anima magic having a sub type similar to Berwick Saga and light dark and staves being reworked. Feel free to adopt any of these ideas anyone reallyMagic tomes come in level   and  forms similar to base el arc rex etc. They also get a debuff siege and AOE tome at certain weapon ranks.Mages have average resistance luck and power strength for physical units magic for magical units bad hpdefenseconstitution and good skillspeed Fire has high powerdurability but bad hitweight for a tome. Earth tome is a subtype of fire which is more like a magic version of axes and were really strong and  accurate unless the enemy is another magic user where its accuracy is lowered and flying unit where it misses entirely. Their debuff tome causes burn status which does th max hp per turn for  turns can ko siege tome is Meteor and AOE is  range wide spell that burns targets. Wind is now ice magic which is lightweight and has high hit but lower attackdurability so they burn through tomes faster. Water tome is the subtype which does splash damage to whoever is around the target. The debuff tome freezes the target and lowers moveavoid  siege tome is Blizzard and AOE is a  range spell that freezes Thunder keeps its innate critical rate but has the lowest power and hit rate. Their subtype is wind magic which either shovessmites the target or has the brave effect. Debuff tome stuns target and lowers speeddodge siege tome is Bolting and AOE is a  range spell that stuns all targets.Monks were completely redesigned so that they are the sole hybrid units. They have high HP and Constitution average powerskillspeed and bad defenseresistance. Attacking up close deals physical damage and attacking from range deals magical damage. While they keep purge Light tomes instead get similar light tome versions to physical weapons like IronSteelSilver ReaversSlayers BravesKillers DevilRune weapons etcDark magic users were fine as they were in GBA but on promo had a choice between getting either  anima magic type D rank staves or the ability to summon a phantom. They have average HP Power Defense and constitution Low Resistance Skill and Speed. Additionally all status staves are now dark magic only.Staves users focus on Power Resistance and Luck with average speed and low HP Defense and constitution. PriestClerics gain D light magic on promo and Troubadours gain  D rank anima magic type.

You try to pull  enemy and their whole cluster runs into your face.I prefer to pull units have  unit enter the aggro zone and everyone else stay just  tile outside of it so when I draw in their whole army I can fight them on my own terms.  Keep in mind the one pulling if not in a choke is going to be taking a significant amount of attacks so definitely pick someone durable.  Send in fliers or other highresist units vs clusters of mages and generals  GKs against clusters of physical attackers.I normally prefer to not have  unit go full Leeroy Jenkins into the enemy since if he gets surrounded on all sides then theres no way out and your backup may not be able to get in there and help.Hope that helped!,fireemblem,d1zapka,2,t5_2t0cn

7248408,0,t1_d22339y,Youre not giving him a fair chance. You said hes a badly balanced unit but hes not. Apothecary Azama is an early game god especially since he already starts at  strength and gets a  bonus upon the heart seal. And also unless youre going to use the Heart Seal on Jakob which really isnt necessary at all for Birthright who else is there to seal? And E rank doesnt hurt Azama at all as he has  base strength the Brass Yumi brings his attack up to  pop him a strength tonic and thats  and give him a decent pair up and itll bring him up to around  attack. E rank is not an issue for this guy. Even then you might say that the fact that he is stuck in a shitty class tree is a point against him but he can pair up with Subaki Azura Hinoka and Sakura for Kinshi Knight and Mozu and Setsuna for Archer both being superior classes that retain his weapon rank. And really is the E grind taking place at Chapter  that much of a big deal? Especially since it barely affects Azama. Hes a great unit it just requires taking a look at him objectively rather than as someone who takes up that precious Heart Seal that you probably wont use on anyone that isnt Jakob or Azama. ,fireemblem,d223cec,1,t5_2t0cn

I noticed that even in the same run if I release the enemy I have seen the same names twice on the chapter even on different enemies. Was wondering how the names are generated? Does it check the logbook to see if you already have a unit with that name to avoid giving it again and if not does that mean since the unit has the same name theoretically you can get any skill on any of the enemies if you are lucky enough to get two different enemies with the same name?,fireemblem,d26i8e9,1,t5_2t0cn

Note that this was before his ban so youll have to follow the deleted posts.Pretty much every post that is by deleted in response to someone saying they would go Nohr is Mayor. Id like to point at this one in particular though.What we can see is that the debate if it can even be called that rapidly turns into two sides shouting at each other. It flows into personal attacks and Im almost certain that both sides left feeling incredibly frustrated. Now repeat what happened there again and again with different users and youll see how his downvote brigade came to be.Now Mayor doesnt deserve his hate. Hes certainly gotten a lot cooler with the personal attacks after the ban. But people still remember that frustrating experience and will continue to downvote him. Its not Hoshido at fault.

When they become available at the armory make sure you get your characters some dual weapons  especially those who only use one type of weapon like Swordmasters or Snipers.

I just got up to the final chapter of it so Im not quite done with it but the entire time each character just had their weapon that they never had to switch off of. Lex had zero reason not to use his brave axe so that was the only weapon he used. For most of the game Sigurd and Seliph had their silver sword that just invalidated the rest of their inventory. Larcei had her brave sword Leif had his light brand... that was all they needed. It was so mindless. At the start of every chapter theyd all get their like  free gold from the arena maybe every couple of castles theyd need to repair it but there was zero strategy behind weapon choice.

7389321,0,t1_d2i3fem,The weapon at the top of a units inventory should always be automatically equipped unless you specifically used the remove command. You can use the shoulder buttons or the XY buttons to toggle between the inventory weapons if you want to use a different one on an enemy.As for what weapons to equip on who well thats part of the strategy. Bronze weapons cant critical or trigger offensive skills but they also reduce your chances of getting hit by a critical and they can also be useful for allowing weaker enemies to defeat units as the stronger units with bronze will be less likely to kill an enemy. You can use stronger iron and steel weapons but steel weapons give your unit a speed penalty. Eventually youll want to start forging weapons to increase their might and hit.As for who to take again part of your strategy. Some people use a smaller army of the same units over and over again allowing them to become very strong. Others prefer to use different units on each chapter. Again largely depends on the the enemies... If you see a bunch of axe fighters youll want to use sword fighters. If you see a lot of mages any unit with high resistance will be ideal.EDIT A good rule of thumb is to always used paired support units together. For example your Avatar has to fight on every chapter so a good idea is to always deploy his or her Srank partner as your lead unit will have a nice stat boost. On the other hand you can use skirmishes and castle battles to grind support among other units.,fireemblem,d2i45ug,1,t5_2t0cn

7470317,0,t3_4hoydm,The problem with some of the paralouges in Fates is that some of them go beyond hard and become nearly impossible without certian items. FEs Shiro is a good example. At endgame he is going to die by the end of turn  so you are forced to use at least one rescue staff.   Then we have obscure characters like FEs Stefan In both games you need to place a specific unit on a specific tile to get him when the game makes no reference to his existence before hand. This is terrible as is punishes the player for not using a guide.  IMO all units should be recruited by the lord or units that join that chapter so you wont miss a unit by letting someone die at the start of the game. Units can be hard to get but not the point where you need to play ridiculously fast or need outside sources to reasonably get them.,fireemblem,d2rbvnj,2,t5_2t0cn

Im not really sure how PEGIs standards differ from the ESRB but one different rule could turn what would be a PEGI  game similar to a T rating into a PEGI  rating similar to an M rating. This would severely harm the marketing for the game. Now while this is pretty unlikely there is no reason for Treehouse to risk it when they could play it safe and make sure everything works while they translate the game for other countries.EDIT Phrasing,fireemblem,d2t4xbz,4,t5_2t0cn

7488287,0,t3_4hwvad,Hey all checking in with my first update for Solo Selena on Lunatic Rev. Havent had much time to get far however I recently completed ch.  so things are starting to roll. Instead of writing a huge reddit comment I decided to try something different and do my major write up in the imgur album while saying small tidbits or answering questions here.Click HERE to check my playthrough albumAfter two chapters this run is going well so far. She wont be tanking amazingly but she can hold her own well. Strong Riposte is an amazing skill that  on counter attack is so useful. Darting Blow is nice helps some and might help more later on until her stats get rolling. Good Fortune has procd some but not often. May help more later on. Camaraderie is useless as it doesnt work with paired up units and it being Selena solo.For now Sky Knight is a reasonable class to stay. Mobility is very key to this. Those stat boosters all went to her except for the arms scroll. I will use that later on when she promotes most likely on something with a Bow to get out of E ranks quickly.Not too far to judge the viability of this run but after one chapter things look doable with this ruleset.WHAT I FORGOT TO MENTIONMU hasOutlaw talentStr BoonMag BaneThis was done to help give Selena the best possible skill pool for what she already has and give the best pair up bonus on top of the good boosts Hoshido Noble gives.Thats all for now if you have any questions please feel free to ask.

7489325,0,t1_d2s8qjm,Ah thanks for the info!I dont think we should be worried that all versions will be pushed to June because then the release date would be unofficially postponed and thats probably not gonna happen. Maybe the local small game shop got screwd over by their supplier sayin that they will only receive the FE Fatesversions in June because the big game store chains are putting pressure on the suppliers for getting all their stock of FE Fatesversions for the th of May? So the theory is that if these big game store chains put enough pressure on their suppliers being big customers and all they might receive the FE Fatesversions that were originally promised to the smaller game shop so that the smaller game shop gets the notice that they wont be receiving anything until June? Does that sound like a possible explanation for the delay? Or maybe the small game shop was late with ordering the FE Fatesversions at their supplier so that they will only receive the second shipment for June?Im literally just brainstorming possible scenarios that might support such a claim of an allinJune release...Because some big game store chains like Game Mania Nedgame FNAC and Amazon have confirmed that for the FE Fates Limited Edition LE there will be a first shipment for the th of May official release date and a second shipment for around the th of June. So I dont think they will screw over early preorders by postponing all versions to June. Unless Nintendo officially postpones the release date but that would be highly unlikely since the game is already finished by the developers released twice JP amp NA localised once NA and probably long been translated to the  languages for the European release.,fireemblem,d2thv5p,1,t5_2t0cn

7495035,0,t1_d2u44er,I chose my example carefully. Hayato has a poor start and is considered a bad unit by many but with investment he objectively grows into one of the strongest  magic users on the route as a Chieftain.In fact I know exactly how Id go about it pair him with Corrin for Supportivesecondary reclass of choice earlypromote and use the first Heart Seal into Chieftain and give him every stat booster. If he was coming up short in lategame two Eternal Seals k absolutely nothing in BR would fix any issues.Some early maps like Ch.  would be slightly difficult but Im confident in being able to do it. Birthright heavily rewards favoritism and lowmanning on all difficulties same as Awakening.

In Ch  the Oni Savages and Rinkah will body her if they hit plus theres also a Ninja in that room. The Diviner room is a bit better but theres Azamas Hexing Rod and an Archer. She probably cant handle the Apothecaries well either. She can try to dodge them but if they hit shes taking a beating. The Spendthrift one is going to straight up OHKO her.

7506547,1,t1_d2vfjef,Odin has a slow Ch but you get around that by having Jakob and Niles bumrush the left villages for an easy k gold so it doesnt really matter how carefully you feed him the dudes coming out of the right villages. After that you buy Nosferatu for him and he contributes against Ch archers Chs entire northwest front Chs Setsuna and Azama rooms Chs archers and Chs armors and Takumi all with minimal support. Nosferatu is seriously underrated it has its downsides but it also gives constant Sol which along with his naturally good Def growth makes him the best tank in the game. Some people will tell you his modest  Magic growth holds him back but in practice it doesnt with Nosferatu you want your OHKOs or HKOs to be as clean as possible so you arent wasting healing and his modest Magic is ideal for that. If you absolutely must have high Magic there is very little competition for the Spirit Dusts that Conquest showers you with.He also has natural access to Vantage I pick this up in Ch usually which is capable of proccing with Nos and lets him just devour the wall in Ch. Furthermore the game gives him the perfect pairup bot in Leo who with no resources gives him a sick MagDefMove pairup. If youre wondering why I dont have Leo in Odins place its because Odin starts contributing earlier. Furthermore his stats wind up higher than his on average despite his humble bases. Leo is in fact a budget Odin who trades Def for overkill Mag and Res.On top of all this if you dont want to use him as a Sorc he makes a far better Dark Knight than Leo as well as a fine Swordmaster though both of these options are wasteful IMO in addition to providing access to the only Calamity Gate and Horse Spirit in the game through his ungodly powerful daughters paralogue. This is just icing on the cake though he shines even in nochild runs.As for Gunter I agree that he has his uses ran him unironically in Revs endgame but Im not a huge fan of dedicated pairup bots in Conquest and would rather let Corrin give out Supportive boosts as needed to the rest of the party. I also find his flying Shelter option highly overrated.,fireemblem,d2vgfc0,0,t5_2t0cn

For my personal enjoyment  is my max on portable. I can handle Radiant Dawn because its on a console so I can a least sit it out.

She will have a better defense than Niles and her options in terms of class are great. Rally Speed is really good.Beruka is Camillalite. You cant go wrong with her. She has access to Axebreaker Axefaire and two rallies and her defense is huge. Having flight and lunge helps too.Kaze is super reliable. He makes Beruka very good and she makes him amazing. Her pair up bonuses and his bonuses were meant for each other. Also they both boost each others movement giving them great utility.Keaton is a foot locked range unit with no way to get a reliable  range without reclass and grinding out of Eranks. His beastbane skill is also outclassed by Camilla Beruka or Effie using a Beastkiller.Gunter is good early game... and thats it. His return chapter doesnt do much for him and if reclassing to Wyvern Lord for a rally bot is done better by other units. Frankly he sucks and his utility is locked to early game and his rejoin chapter.Effie is got great stats and growths and is a huge powerhouse early game but she is begging for more movement early game. The two options are also not very appealing. You either patch her up with an early Master Seal into Great Knight or use Boots on her.

For one it can seem out of place in a Support chain or in other cases just not make sense or enter pedoincest territory Such as Elise and any male character besides Takumi and maybe Odin FE Stuff that probably everyone knows by nows if hes his Awakening age.I would really like for S Ranks between characters like those not end in marriage and possibly as an indicator the S would not be green.I also liked how in Revelations every map was different.

7586458,0,t3_4j86ff,Depends on how much variation allowed in the gameplay department. Am I allowed to have gaidens villigar system with RDs magic Trinity? Am I allowed to unnerf luck? Is how much crossover is allowed between styles?,fireemblem,d34jkio,3,t5_2t0cn
7586947,0,t3_4j898a,I hated his style in Awakening but he really tightened it up for Fates. I particularly enjoy the way he did his shadows in Fates. It muted the colors really well when compared to Awakenings bright solid colors. His faces are so much better its not even funny. Id like to see him stick around for a bit longer. All of the artists they contract take some time to make everything feel natural. Even Senri Kita didnt hit her stride until FE. The only exception to this is Sachiko Wada who was the character illustrator for FE but she had the experience of being attached to the series since FE as a graphics artist. Mayumi Hirota FETRS was also phenomenal right out of the gate but she did the Treasure artwork for FE before she was attached to FE for character designs. Basically what Im saying is that every artist has their weird shit like Kozaki and Awakening. I think hell only improve as time goes on but theyll probably grab another artist and go through another odd looking game like they always do. ,fireemblem,d34lkk9,6,t5_2t0cn

7588836,0,t3_4j86ff,Although I would personally be extremely hyped for such a game such a concept has some serious pros and cons.The pros are that it would be much easier for people to create their own FE games. You no longer need to know how to hackprogram in order to form your own FE game which opens the doors to the many people who wanted to make great new content but were limited by their knowledge or lack thereof of programming.The cons are pretty much the same as with most Mario Maker maps most maps are trash. This is due to a vast majority of people being unfamiliar with the creative process behind good level design and when combined with their inexperience a great majority of the maps that they would produce would be of very low quality. This is a problem with a lot of FE hacks already. The guy making the hack may be good at making cool new sprites and animations but oftentimes the maps themselves are uninteresting and bland.Overall a FE Maker does have potential. Some of the hacks and fangames that Ive played show that there are talented people out there. The main challenge that the people who buy FE Maker would face would be to find the gems hidden among all the rubbish that would make up the majority of the maps.,fireemblem,d34tam9,1,t5_2t0cn
7588957,0,t1_d34req2,I guess Ill chime for SeveraSelena and see if everything I know about her is actually wrong. I dont know about everyone else but Ill say why I like her. Sorry in advance if I word wall.The first big appeal to me is her class as mercenary. Its my favorite class line an I always make sure to have one on my team. Female mercs are not commonly put in either with only  naturally occurring in the entire series one of which being remade into a myrmidon. Second I just love her design in both Awakening and Fates. In Fates she probably has one of my favorite designs in the entire series with just how great mercenaries looks. Combined with her great color palette and we have something I love. If only it went to Hero... As an added bonus I know a lot of people just love twintails Ill admit I love her hair as well especially the red hair color.Lastly pretty much how she is. This is a weird ground to walk on as I feel Im . seconds away from someone yelling tsundere trope but Ill try to explain what i think in a half decent way. It also is kind of broken into several different parts.As weird or hilarious as it sounds I love that she doesnt put up with anyones crap. She wasnt really putting up with any of Inigo being a flirt to the point in the Laslow support of straight up giving him a taste of his own medicine. Similar stuff can be sort of said for Owains Owainness and Geromes brooding. I could keep listing of things but considering Im saying this to someone who has done some really well done support threads I feel out of my league a bit. Tsun Her being headstrong is just something I really like her recruitment chapter shows this well.On the flip side of her being stand offish theres the dere how much she actually cares. As Inigo puts it You put on a good show but I know under all those thorns youre a total sweetie and hes totally right totally just a two bit tsundere. Some of my favorite examples of it are in her supports with Owain Noire and Awakenings Avatar. I just like to know that if shes doing something or messing with someone its because she cares enough for whats best you just have to go through however rude she may or may not be when dealing with it. If she didnt care she wouldnt even give it a passing thought. In the hot spring DLC her convo with Morgan also kind of says some of why I like her but it is too long to quote here.Big part I left out was her relationship with Cordelia since it kind of goes without saying that the moment you meet her with Cordelia that you realize Severa has mommy issues. I like awakenings bad timeline story stuff so I really enjoyed how Severa dealt with the trauma I find it way better than how a few others did Gerome. I also just really like their support it just sat right with me and felt good int he ending but theres no way Severa would ever let anyone else know thats how she acted so her random lines go back to being rude seem fitting to me that way.Lastly her competitiveness Fates showed us that shes matured became more competitive even with a bad personal skill to show for it. she shows that she has in fact improved as a person since Awakening all  have though she isnt entirely over everything yet no matter what she tells you. A lot of stuff in Fates shows how competitive she is but I wont list it as Im word walling now.Im sorry this was a long postpoorly written but I just wanted to say why. I could go on for way longer and in more detail but Ill end it here.also I think she is pretty.,fireemblem,d34tsf4,4,t5_2t0cn

7673169,0,t1_d3ecv0g,gt but regardless of that it seemed like the game was actively trying to build up Hoshidan AS WELL as break down the Nohr side very rapidlyafter chapter I cant disagree with that. In fact a lot of our stories in other media tend to play out in this exact same way where something awful happens that changes the MCs point of view early on and then they rise up and fight against it almost impulsively not meaning this in a negative way and become the key to defeating the other side in an external sense. That being said though this game does give you the opportunity to stop that feeling inside and say Wait a moment. Maybe theres more going on here that I dont understand. Maybe if I slip back into Nohr I can look into why these things are happening and see if I cant help fix shit. Youre right that the impulse to join Hoshido is definitely there. But when talking about reasoning and logic as we started to in this chain there are good arguments for both sides.Not going to get into how each of these routes turns out in this thread since a lot of people who just got the game would be browsing here.,fireemblem,d3ee7fx,2,t5_2t0cn

Heshe also basically has a few chapters to himselfherself to really get a huge lead over everyone else. The Alpha Yato and Omega Yato giving the bonuses of both the Hoshidan and Nohrian Yatos also really helps out. Azura has fantastic availability and sings. Camilla joins later than in Conquest but is nonetheless incredibly powerful. Flight is also super good in RV so she has that going for her.Worst  Nyx  Odin  Azama? Really dont know who to put here.Nyx and Odin both join incredibly underleveled and perform absolutely terribly against enemies in their join chapter.

7702601,0,t3_4kt61m,Fates overall is harder than Awakening imo. Conquest has a lot of challenging maps and objectives BR focuses a lot on having a good player phase and a decent enemy phase and that is something Awakening didnt really have. With pair up in Awakening you were going to have an amazing Enemy Phase but in Fates it has been toned down so Pair up isnt as good hit calculations have been buffed for lower hit rates and enemies being able to use pair up too makes it a bit harder than Awakening. Dont feel discouraged however. It is possible to beat Birthright if you know what to focus on. In Birthright you will definitely need to focus on getting as many kills as possible player phase or positioning your units to move in for the kill on your turn. Take advantage of the skills your units have for player phase. Poison Strike is great if you know you cant kill the enemy unit. Seal Defense Level  Spear Fighter and Seal Resistance Level  Oni Chieftain are both great skills that keep Rinkah and Oboro relevant for your other units in case they cant get the kill. Remember that Silas is amazing. He has a big defensive stat and is effectively able to tank this route no problem. Takumi is a great unit too able to deal huge damage thanks to Fujin Yumi having so much mt and making him similar to a flying unit for terrain. Take advantage of the Guard Naginata on your units. It is pretty fantastic to get  defres even with the reduced mt. What people say when Birthright is easy is that BR is quite a bit easier than previous games. FE FE FE are all quite tough. Nothing unbeatable but way more difficult than BR. I would even say FE and FE are tougher than BR but it isnt like BR is without challenge.,fireemblem,d3hqg67,4,t5_2t0cn

Ryoma while he doesnt have Defender still has an absolutely amazing player phase and Enemy Phase. Pair up with Camilla and he gets everything he could ever want.

They both have left their respective mountains and visited humans many times before. Id be surprised if they didnt understand them. Besides having them act like total dunces is ridiculous.

7768027,0,t1_d3p40wv,Ike fighting for Elincia is exactly what the situation was in PoR and the nobles didnt give credit to Elincia for that. So its not realistic to assume theyd see Ike putting down a rebellion as Elincias victory whether he was working for her or not. I dont think any of those options wouldve worked or been better than the way the scene currently is. Killing Lucia would mean killing a playable character for story reasons which I think is almost always bad game design. The rebels already knew the CRKs were there the CRKs were also in the fort presumably with the gates shut so a surprise attack by them would be impossible and in any attack that wasnt a surprise the rebels would just immediately kill Lucia. Threatening to kill Ludveck would either come off as unbelievable or completely out of character for Elincia. The purpose of the scene is to make her appear strong not psychotic.Maybe someone could come up with better scripting of the cutscene but I think a surprise attack by someone the rebels dont know is there is by far the best way of resolving that situation and the Greil Mercenaries are the obvious choice for who would launch that surprise attack.,fireemblem,d3p5v96,2,t5_2t0cn

7825089,0,t1_d3vfo07,Selenas Tsundere aspect is a fantastic part of her character because she takes the generic Tsundere archetype and seems to make it her own.She takes it to a whole new level from cold but secretly caring and turns it into a whole thing in where shes honestly a dick to everyone. Shes not just cold but caring shes down right mean or even vicious but really she doesnt mean it. Shes just trying to help people improve or interact with them in one of the few ways she knows.And I say one of the few ways she knows because her Tsundere archetype can be attributed to her childhood the same way we attribute Owains theatrics except it goes more than just I act like this cause I want too it helps me cope and more into I act like this because I literally cannot act anyway else.When you look at some of Severas supports in Awakening and some in Fates we see she has an inferiority complex not just with her mother but with everyone.This is especially apparent in Fates where she strives to be the best.This is important because we know this complex stems from her childhood specifically feelings of inferiority with her mother.After Cordelia died in the war fighting for a man that she may have loved more then her own daughter at least thats how it is in Severas eyes based on their first interaction when they reunited in Awakenings timeline. Severa grew up not only feeling like she wasnt good enough for her parents but like she was in the shadow of Cordelia the entire time.So here we have a young girl living in the fucking apocalypse with mommy issues towards a mother shell never get to see again who she assumes never loved her because she left to fight for the man she had such a strong love for and died instead of staying with her daughter.Her cold and mean attitude stems from her psychological issues as a  child not only from losing her parents but also the fact that she has feelings that her mother didnt love her or at least didnt love her as much as she loved Chrom.Its way more than just Tsundereness when you look into its down right psychological trauma all stemming from inferiority as a child and feelings of being unloved and after Cordelias death unwanted.That is what makes her so lovable because people like me care about her when they look at her past and how it turned her into who she is.Fantastic character in my opinion.,fireemblem,d3vlugz,17,t5_2t0cn

Thats the goal here and thats an approach that should give much better balance.Find more ways to have the player interact with the maps and use those as map objectives.

I preordered the Awakening artbook too! I cant wait. I think what I liked so much about Fire Emblem in Awakening was that it was almost like Pokmon one of my favorite franchises without the ballztothewallz diehard competitive scene. No natures IVs EVs unless you play Pokmon competitively all these terms might not make sense haha. The support between characters makes them seem more dimensional.I should mention I own a copy of Shadow Dragon. I havent played further than the second chapter because its pretty hard and quite different from Awakening and Fates in terms of gameplay and aesthetics. And I like your enthusiasm for the series. I shouldnt matter if you played one game or all. If youre a fan youre a fan! Im a bit disappointed I only know one other person within my group of contacts who likes the series. But Im quite passionate about the series yes. Ever since Awakening I barely played anything else out of pure fascination with Fire Emblem. It my most played DS game but I think Fates will surpass that. Id like to exchange DS FCs and My Castle addresses.

7924246,0,t3_4nnwsh,Well I think Genealogy of the Holy War would almost make for a better movie in my opinion since there was more background information involved.

7926119,0,t1_d46xz0y,Well we dont know the full details but according to the approximate timeline Mikoto came to Hoshido with a newborn Corrin which benchmarks Hinoka at around . Ryoma would have been  or  clearly old enough to remember the time and circumstance of Mikotos arrival. However children are easily impressionable at the age of  so its possible Hinoka could have been coerced that Mikoto had come earlier and given birth to her and Sumeragis child. Sumeragis wife would have also been pregnant with Takumi at the time and given birth to Sakura just a little bit later. She died shortly after this which would benchmark Hinoka at about  by the time her mother died. Which doesnt really line up as Hinoka clearly would have been old enough to know that Mikoto had Corrin while her mother was still alive. But...Why doesnt Hinoka approve of Mikoto? Perhaps because she believes Mikoto was having an affair with her father before her mother died? This could be the story she was told in order to keep her from the truth and it would have wrapped everything up in a nice little bundle. Clearly Hinoka got over this but it makes sense and it doesnt fracture the timeline too much.,fireemblem,d46yykr,3,t5_2t0cn

People sweep the criticism under the rug with Fire Emblem has never had a good story but honestly I thought that every previous game even awakening and blood pact dawn had at least an acceptable story while this is the first time the plot has been utter trash in my opinion. The game literally would of been better with an excuse plot rather than the shit it tried to pull.

8102012,0,t1_d4qp1lw,Pursuit Critical Coefficient existed in Thracia  Fire Emblem . Basically it was a stat that characters would have between a  in you cannot change this and its preset. If the unit is going to double attack on the second attack their critical rate gets multiplied by their PCC.For example Unit A has a critical hit rate of  and a PCC of . Their first hit would still have a critical rate of  but their second hit would have a critical rate of  basically guaranteed critical hit. Critical hits in this game are also damage x before enemy defense is calculated rather than the standard damage x after enemy defense is calculated. This meant that critical hits could break through defenses easier and could be counted upon more often with certain units.I dont think regular enemy mooks have PCC but I know that certain bosses do utilize it as well,fireemblem,d4qqmer,3,t5_2t0cn

8114933,0,t1_d4s6rrb,Thats a really interesting idea. I wish the idea of the different magic in Hoshido and Nohr was touched upon. Nohrian magic appears to be something inherently almost unnatural with the creation of Faceless and artificial energy despite the very basis of magic being that it is naturebased. It even is referred to as Nature in FE although thats probably just poor translation.On the other hand Hoshido seems to be the very opposite every attack is a spirit of some sort suggesting that religion is deeply intertwined into the magic of Hoshido. Maybe this ties into the reasoning behind the magic barrier Mikoto set up maybe its because shes a saintlike figure and thus she has the divine power of protection? This is also suggested by the healers being known as Shrine Maidens and to a lesser extent the mages being known as Diviners Of course this all dabbles into pure speculation but its genuinely fascinating.Oh and by the way happy cake day!,fireemblem,d4s6x7d,1,t5_2t0cn

Why gender specific? Because the Legendary staff is only available in ConquestRevelation and the S rank Shuriken is only available in BirthrightRevelation though you can play through either gender you want. When its time to pick up the kids your servant can pass down Replicate to give you another unit or  if you are FCorrin with Replicate giving you even more characters to work with especially when Jakobs kid is an amazing staff bot and would gain access to the S rank staff. ,fireemblem,d4tksc7,3,t5_2t0cn

If he marries into the royal family hell be able to have everyone do everything he wants especially once he becomes Exalt. The problem is that he has to marry someone in the royal family. He cant marry Chrom because nohomo and his younger sister Lissa is a nonbear meat eater as much as Robin wants to be the Exalt he cant handle a vegetarian wife. This is where Chroms daughter Lucina comes in. Lucina is royal very sexy and most importantly doesnt mind bear meat. Robin seduces Lucina Robin marries Lucina Robin stabs Chrom to death takes Chroms place as Exalt Robin gets Lucina very pregnant  she is very sexy after all Robin replaces Lucina as the main lord profit?TLDR  Robin hooks Chrom up with a wife to marry their daughter so he can become part of the royal family. Chrom isnt relevant to Robins plan but Lucina is so shes the main lord until Robin moves her out of the way by making her a housewife.,fireemblem,d4wnl3v,21,t5_2t0cn

One of your units must attackcounter the enemy unit to be healed every turn without killing it and he must be strong enough to tank hits from that enemy.

Hes someone wise and gave knowledge to humans because he liked them. However when dragons are really powerful they tend to become insane at some point of their lives sooner or later.As years went by humans forgot about everything he did and one day his build up rage released a little destroying a forest or something like that. Everyone viewed him as a monster so he hid far away from them and only his friend the Vallite king who believed in him continued to visit him. His anger build even faster after what the humans has done to him but he still wasnt completely insane. However he killed his friend because of it and thats where he attained the point of no return.Heirs of Fates shows that he regret his friends death so deeply that hes mistaking his greatgrandchild for him and he forgave him even in his crazed state.

8250386,0,t3_47nakm,Hi I have a few questions here.. Do Felicia Jakob and DLC classes get a free levelup? Im talking specifically about the  gt  level up. Standard units go from level  to promoted level  and get the promoted stat bonuses but reclassing to a DLC class also gives you promoted stats. So effectively they get a free level up correct? I mean it probably doesnt matter because of Eternal Seals but I was just curious.. In the event that I want to marry M!Corrin to a st Gen mother which child is best to scrap per path?. This is a pretty wide question so I understand if you cant answer it. Assuming I dont want to take advantage of buying skills from castles what skills are importantessential to pass down from parents to children? For instance I noticed Hinoka!Sophie doesnt get the Spear Fighter line unless she Sranks Shiro so I passed down Seal Speed from Hinoka. Assume that Im getting all the children at Ch right at the Offspring Seal so  skills arent really practical excluding JakobFelicia.. I noticed that the  Str Skill debuff on Beaststone stacks with every use. Does this mean I should just stick to the normal Beaststone and Beastrune?Thanks for any help you can provide.,fireemblem,d58urva,1,t5_2t0cn

Only managed to nab the Shining Bow and Goddess Icon of course in the paralogue because I wasnt touching the right side Shining Bow Adventurers were too scary for me. Mostly it was a chance to get some experience and work on weapon ranks a bit. was incredibly tedious. With only one DV user and a bunch of low Res units tackling the right side wasnt a good idea so everyone stayed left. The primary time consumer was getting everyone through that corridor next to room where Sakura is. I needed to stay out of range of the Onmyoji and have everyone regroup so I could nab the Spirit Dust take out Yukimura and seize before having to deal with the reinforcements. is going to be a slog I think since the Bolt Naginata Falcos are going to be pretty dangerous as will the Onmyojis. I may just completely do a on vs Ryoma the right side of  is going to be a nogo and the Silence Rod is useless to me. The right side of  will also be a nogo since no way am I going to even attempt to deal with the mages. Which means I get to deal with Stoneborn again. Yay.

You would probably need to range lock it make it balancedBut then youll ask me why not make the gun . Then comes up the issue of why even use arrows in the first place or rather why cant bows do  since in real logic you can just shoot the guy next to you with arrows just as well as with a gun. Guns do not work in turn based strategy. In a game where you can rush cavaliers through enemy forces to attack archers and mages directly your argument for protection of guns is invalid. And then all the aspects of a gun the long reload and time to aim especially is trivialized  when the gun can attack as many times as a man with a dagger in the same turn.,fireemblem,d5c2744,1,t5_2t0cn

8317438,0,t3_4tgw2n,Personally I really hope it is gone for good.Without weapon durability it adds a lot more strategy. Most weapons stay useful even later in the game with positives and negatives to them. It also allows you to make more specific builds since you dont need to worry about magical weapons breaking for example.Managing each units inventory becomes even more important since there are more options than before. Unlike in Awakening where many weapons were better than others you might want to carry both an iron and a steel weapon so you can achieve different things. You also no longer end up not using certain weapons due to not wanting to waste them.The current weapon system still isnt perfect though. Something I do miss now that weapon durability is gone is the item management aspect. I love resource management in games and I enjoyed having to make sure every unit had enough uses on their weapon. This aspect isnt completely gone in Fates of course since staves still have durability but it isnt as important.There still needs to be some balancing changes such as buffing silver weapons but it still is a great system.Overall the lack of weapon durability allows for more strategy in weapon selection and in chapters. I was worried about it at first but now I think it is a great mechanic or lack of one.,fireemblem,d5h8idq,4,t5_2t0cn

I try to patch things up and fucking Arthur dies I thought he was bulky but he gets two shot.

8380714,0,t1_d5oz1i8,Characters have both personal growths and class growths. To get their effective growths the ones that determine what the odds of stats increasing when they level up you add together both of them together. Some promoted and unpromoted version of classes have the same growths but most dont.For example Ryomas personal growths are  hp  strength  magic  skill  speed  luck  defense and  resistance. Swordmaster has class growths of  hp  strength  magic  skill  speed  luck  defense and  resistance. Master of Arms has class growths of  hp  strength  magic  skill  speed  luck  defense and  resistance. So you add those together. As a swordmaster Ryoma has growths of  hp  strength  magic  skill  speed  luck  defense and  resistance. As a master of arms Ryoma has growths of  hp  strength  magic running theme with him  skill  speed  luck  defense and  resistance.Class growths are much lower than personal growths so they wont have that much of an effect on leveling unless there is a drastic difference between the growths rates of two classes like the difference of speed between a swordmaster and a knight. For this reason I recommend paying more attention to the personal growths of your units and not worrying as much about the class growths as much. If you want a list of personal and class growths there are lists here and here,fireemblem,d5p4yxv,1,t5_2t0cn

There are absoloutely games where the story came first and there are also games where they were both concieved and created together.Either way I have a relatively low standard for stories in games and tend to care more about gameplay but I have the capacity to be impressed by story and I dont tolerate insultingly bad ones. Basically I may have low standards but Im not ambivilent when something does well Im impressed and when it dips below that low standard Im apalled. You could compare this to my opinions on things like graphical quality or audio really Im not expecting a lot but I still really appreciate it when theres value there yet equally put off when theres negative value.,fireemblem,d5wz0ru,3,t5_2t0cn

8573495,0,t3_4x89w0,In Awakening each female character has a fastest growing support with a male character and vice versa. They all only have one fast growing pairing.Chroms for example is fastest with Sumia. Sumias is fastest with Chrom. That as well as all the other evidence cutscene called Lovebirds Sumia holding a baby in the opening etc point towards it being canon and many aree that Chromia is canon.I therefore think that all of these fastest growing Awakening pairings both gen  and gen  have it neither Robin nor Morgan have one are the canon pairings because I believe that the creators purposely chose those specific pairings to be fastest. Some are more logical than others e.g I think LissaVaike is logical because Owain is a weirdo like Vaike and its reminiscent of BoydMist whereas unless Im missing something I dont think CordeliaLibra has much behind it but I do think they must have fast growths for a reason.But it doesnt outright confirm anything. Id say of DSFE the only outright canon pair is Chromia.Fates has no fast pairings aside from siblingsretainer relationships I really think Fates wanted no canon pairings at all so shipping wars wouldnt occur.

8575663,0,t1_d6dj653,If you marry Leo or anyone off you can use a Partner Seal to change him to his partners class  so if he Ssupports Charlotte for example it can change him into a Berserker or Hero. His only Hoshidan romantic supports are with Sakura and Hinoka meaning that if he marries one of them he can turn into a Great Master Onmyoji Sakura Falcon Knight or Kinshi Knight Hinoka. Because Azuras primary class isnt passable shell pass her secondary class Sky Knight meaning you can do that instead of Hinoka and get the same class set.If he Asupports someone you can do the same thing with a Friendship Seal but those are more limited. Leos possible Asupports are with Xander Odin Niles and Takumi meaning that if you A with Odin you can turn him into a SwordmasterMaster of Arms since Leo already has the Dark Mage set and Samurai is Odins secondary or a SniperKinshi Knight from Takumi with a Friendship Seal.Its the same deal with all the other characters  check who they can Asupport with to see what other classes they can grab e.g. Takumi can take classes from one of Jakob Ryoma Hinata or Leo.,fireemblem,d6djha4,2,t5_2t0cn

The same context can be applied to their dialogue with Saizo they wont let people get in the way of saving their family.Contrast this with C. In  the only thing going on here is that Corrin is being blasted for betraying one half of their family. In C their little brother is literally screaming at them that they will kill them and enjoy doing it. Theyre reminding Corrin that theyre fighting for the people who killed their own mother and plenty of other innocent people. Corrin knows this and the truth stings. In C Corrin made a promise to Hinoka to keep Ryoma alive. On top of the prospect of fulfilling that promise going down the drain their brother has just completely disowned them.

She sees their weaknesses and wants to take care of them whereas Niles and Owain dont really fit with any aspect of her character other than maybe Niles is also flirtatious. Additionally Leo being a bit of an oddball fits well with Niles and Owain too. Hed appreciate Niles humour and Owains quirky authenticity and they both help bring him out of his shell. Compatible personalities arent just about people whore identical to each other hanging out. Its also about how they contrast. Niles and Owains relationship with Leo is interesting because they seem so different they bring out aspects of him that retainers similar to him wouldnt.,fireemblem,d6lt1wa,17,t5_2t0cn

Marth is bland by modern standards but at the time he was a very fleshedout likable hero.  He made it into Melee due to large fan demand from Japan iirc.As for Ike his games did not sell very well due to the series being fairly niche however his games are very highly regarded and a lot of people really like his character.

Would it be a time limit on the actual gameplay i.e. moving your units around not enemy phases battle animations or cutscenes or on everything? If it was on everything itd give an advantage to players like me that skip battle animations and utilize the start button way too much to skip things like enemy phases and I dare say that it might encourage players to skip over everything to save time. Even if it was a time limit on just actual gameplay I feel it would still penalize those who spend a lot of time planning their units moves.,fireemblem,d6mhlqi,1,t5_2t0cn

8688562,0,t3_4yyoq2,If I could change revelation I would make it so that not all units are recruited during the game. I love the idea that fire emblem choices have consequences permadeath for example and with the theme of fates it would be interesting to add more choice than chapter  and shura to the game. Having all the units is unnecessary at least for main game I would have loved to have to make the choice to recruit certain units over others during missions. Such as between saving either Leos retainers or Takumiss retainers who are both in danger on opposite sides of the map. Or maybe have a mission in a border town and if you visit and defend the Hoshidan village you get Ryoma but if you pick the Nohrian village you get Xander. I do not know how to balance this system or to create the maps for it but it would be something I would like to play and it would add replay value to the game. It could also make some the the worse conquest units Odin more relevant based off availability. This could also make post game min maxing more interesting by adding more caveats but I do not play that and have not given it any thought. So any thoughts? Good idea bad idea?

I think theres a lot about her thats suggested more than spelled out for the player some of which you pointed out and that sort of characterization can be a really good catalyst for writers to play around with.Also whered you get the Reminiscence piano arrangement??

8727865,0,t3_4dsc85,I did it! It was a journey and so much fun. The different skillsets the different approaches to the chapters. Of course having done a lunatic playthrough before helps a lot. I put a restriction on myself not using dlc items I am sure it is a lot of fun to play around with them too. Plus not getting the my castle weapons makes it a lot more challenging as I think Hoshidans are blessed with the better weapons namely dual weapons there is only dual club and calamity gate in conquest to my knowledge. Of course killer weapons are nice but with the exception of Gazak I dindnt find them very useful weak  randomness.Reagrding my MVPs I used the same boss units. The other generic units werent much worth bulding as you could mostly capture better units in the later chapters.I decided to go with strength Corrin since I have never used her before. I also fed her with all draco shields and talismans to make her as tanky as possible. With  str in the end this came in clutch for the final battle with takumi.Haitaka got fucked speedwise with only  speed at the end. Despite this he was very very useful especially in the chapters before rallyman. Paired up with a swordmaster it wasnt even that bad.Kumagera is freaking beast. And with a couple of speedwings I could somewhat make the best out of his lackluster speed. As you said he is the Xander of this run couldnt have put it better myself.Gazak This guy is such a monster. Reclassed him into a hero and then back to berserker to give him sol and axebreaker. Him and corrin could easily handle the onslaught of berserkers and generals in chapter . He singlehandedly defeated all the generals by himself oneshotting them and easily sustaining himself with sol. He Capped str skill and def in the end.Gerald general from chapter  Also such a monster. Gave him luna which was very useful pairing him up with nohrian trust corrin.

8759671,0,t1_d70j9b9,I would argue Laslow is even with him his bases and growths arent even bad and his speed is exaggerated and Swordmaster Odin is definitely better than him combat wise. Hinata really reminds me more of Laslow than Selena if you switched their spots in both games I dont think there would be much of a difference aside from Laslow being bulkier and stronger. Selena is definitely a better unit.,fireemblem,d70masn,8,t5_2t0cn

8761842,0,t1_d70vy9f,Lets not forget Laslow has dumb HP too and Defense pairups are pretty abundant in Nohr. Also I think its pretty much agreed upon that Hinata should always go SM because his speed will just not keep up without the promo gains. Pairups and tonics do a lot but they can only go so far. As for Selena I think they are still comparable. Selena has  Dracoshields over him Laslow has a Seraph Robe over her. Still Laslows Def can be patched up very easily in Nohr with pair ups Selenas HP cant. Although honestly neither of them have very bad HP or Def Selenas HP is a bit sketchy outside of the Hero class though.,fireemblem,d70w3pp,1,t5_2t0cn

Ideal class is dark knight but you can also get malig knight if Kana friends with Percy.

8783045,0,t3_50ech4,Shadow Dragon PMu my shift key isnt working but only on certain keys. Wtf very annoying Day  A few facts I didnt share yesterday Difficulty is H. Last time I beat this game was on H seven years ago. So Im bumping it up a little but not all the way. Nonpicked units can do some meatshielding cause its Shadow Dragon and I gotta kill so many unpicked units for gaiden EXP anyway and Im bringing along unpicked healers cause Im not enough of a rules purist to spend a million turns waiting on forts.Team yesterdays post Since the picks were not quite completed the last two are wild card slots. I added Wolf as one cause Ive been inordinately fond of that guy since high school and the other wild card will be whomsoever manages to survive the gaiden chapter bloodbath.Chapters  Well I had Caeda and Jagen so everything was all right. Cord and Barst came next followed by Castor. Baby squad assemble!   Chapters  More babies in the form of Navarre and Merric. When reclassing unlocks we get Mage Navarre Pirate Barst Draco Jagen and my pal Dark Mage Cord. Only room to swap one mage so Caeda gets to stay a flier for just a small and precious time longer.  Chapters  Hardin and Wolf show up while I sacrifice some of their friends. Hardin becomes a myrm at the end of the chapter which is a pretty cool look for him and I swap Wendell to Bishop to free up a Mage slot for Caeda. I am forging fire tomes each chapter btw.  x Just EXP feeding at this point. I didnt even get Athena.   Im still in the middle of this one cause I had to stop for DampD. I have an elderly manakete now and my draco girlfriend has been glimpsed but eludes me for now. Wolf is pulling time as a general wanted him as a horseman but he fucking dies constantly as one. I guess I should also make Castor a knight to work on his future general lance ranks...shrug.So so far so good. Thanks people who helped me pick its making revisiting this game a lot better than when I just tried to pick it up and go last week. ,fireemblem,d73jwgy,1,t5_2t0cn

8825103,0,t3_511gwp,Not a particularly amazing cavalier not a bad one either. You can use him solidly from chapters one to . Hell never be a frontline fighter like Sigurd or Quan but hell be useful for filling in gaps and supporting other people due to the whole mounted thing. I would still personally rate him under characters like Ayra and Holyn however.As a father while he passes down pursuit which is usually a good thing he doesnt do much else. No holy weapons no other skills of note Nihil barely sees any use due to enemys lack of skills and he cant even pass down good lancesswords because of his weapon level capping out at B for both after promotion. His best pairings are either Raquesis or Sylvia which is unfortunate because they both have much better pairings. Sylvia is best with Claude to enable Valkyrie staff since it really doesnt matter what your dancers growths are and Ive always found RaquesisBeowulf makes for a good Delmund with good weapons and skills.Overall ratingUsability  A solid unit who wont hold you back mounted  weapon level.Power  There are much better options for powerhouse units in this game whether youre looking at mounted or unmounted units.Father Rating Arden No holy blood no good weapons to pass down best pairings are overshadowed by better ones. ,fireemblem,d78nlqo,2,t5_2t0cn

Other factors such as a units stats ability to rescue and skills are what determines what optiins they have available. In the Florina example you mentioned yes she can move farther but her stats are likely inferior to Oswins meaning she isnt able to take on as many enemies as him lowering her number of available options. Or lets say we have a cleric and a mercenary. Now for the sake of argument lets say there are  enemies nearby and the mercenary isnt injured yet.

So I assumed the people of Tellius were going to become more selfsufficientsecular and Yune would just let everyone do their own thing. Seems like a solid ending to me.Also IMO the Tellius series was at its peak when it was the most groundedwhen the story revolved around politics war and ambitious kings rather than goddesses and magical blood pacts. The human element really adds a lot. So I dont think having another goddess as an antagonist would be particularly compelling.And honestly I dont trust current IS to make a good Tellius game.,fireemblem,d7obp2u,9,t5_2t0cn

8966441,0,t1_d7p8n0l,Just off the top of my head.Aideen x Midir pass down the brave bow and the killer bow since Lester is almost a carbon copy of Midir. Have Aideen pass down pretty much whatever staves she has her hands on that her daughter can use with her B rank staves. Ayra x Lex Have Ayra pass down a silver sword and whatever other swords you have lying around. I dont actually recommend having her pass down her brave sword since it is much better used elsewhere on a unit that doesnt already one round everything. If you can have Lex kill Chagall in chapter  and pass down his silver blade since that is the only sword he can pass down that his child actually wants. He cant buy it though only pick it up from the boss drop so dont miss it. Lachesis x Beowulf Have Beowulf pass down a silver sword or silver blade if Lex isnt any random swords you have and perhaps the defense ring. Or just whatever you have Beowulf using since Delmud is largely identical to him. Make sure Lachesis passes down the mend staff earth sword and prayer sword. You can also pass down the return staff if you didnt have Aideen do that. Fury x Lewyn Have Fury pass down Finns brave lance and potentially one of the magic swords as well as whatever else youve had her using. Lewyn can simply pass down what hes been using though his son wont need the pursuit ring if you had Lewyn holding onto it and make sure that Lewyn passed down ForsetiHolsety since that is by far the most important benefit from this pairing. Briggid x Holyn Briggid just passes down her silver bow and Yewfelle her son doesnt need anything else. Holyn can pass down a ton of swords so that the gen  thief can sell them for money. If you really want to use said thief for combat I wouldnt recommend it but Holyn can pass down the brave sword to them which will make them combat usable. Considering how important the brave sword is though I suggest not doing that. Tiltyu x Azel Their children function very similarly to them and start with equipment that already works well for them so this is fairly easy. Just have them pass down whatever theyve been using. You can also pass down the paragon ring from Azel since Tiltyus son is only good once he promotes but Id recommend using it on Sigurds son.Sylvia x Claude Doesnt really matter. You can have Sylvia pass down the leg ring and knight ring if you arent passing them down to Sigurds son. Claude doesnt matter you should try to have Aideen pass down all the important staves since her daughter joins sooner and because Sylvias son is so bad and joins so late. Just have him pass down the staves no one else can. Sigurd x Deidre Sigurd passes down everything he can get his hands on. Brave sword a magic sword preferably light or wind strength ring speed ring barrier ring defense ring paragon ring leg ring even knight ring if you want. You want Sigurds son to get as much of an edge early on as he can so he can promote as quickly as possible to get his horse and he wants all the movement and stat boosts he can so he can get there faster. They dont have a daughter so Deidre is whatever. Cuan x Ethlyn Cuans inheritance doesnt really matter much he can pass down whatever he has on him. Ethlyn doesnt pass down her staves so give them to someone else. It is also not a bad idea for her to pass down an armor slayer. If no one else is using it she can also pass down her light sword. Also if you dont need it on anyone for chapters  you can have her pass down the pursuit ring because her son only gets it when he promotes. ,fireemblem,d7pmq8r,2,t5_2t0cn

This could be an ok move depends on what those maps are though I always felt that the massive maps of FE gave it its own character as a game too felt like you really were moving across the continent but it does get a bit slow at times.I assume theyve make you have a cap for how many units you can use per map too was pretty cool letting you use your entire army on as many maps as you wanted but I dont see the modern games doing that kind of thing.Theyd probably change a bunch of the key storyplot points If youve played it you know what I mean.

9180772,0,t3_560rth,I thought about ranting about the Camus archetype but theres one character that always bothers me and thats Charlotte. Given that Fates draws heavily on the idea of dichotomies I was initially really excited when I saw Charlottes design.  She reflects an issue that continues to affect women today women who are perceivedappear to be physically powerful can be considered very unattractive for a recent real life example of this see Simone Biles instagram and the number of guys that posted comments like ew or those are man abs when she shared a picture of herself with the other gymnasts at the beach.  Thus Charlottes design is meant to display how she overcompensates in the feminine department to counter her strength. also as an aside I admit getting some personal feelings involved here  I was a dancer from  and a weight lifter through college so I had my share of men and women who would actually walk up and tell me to my face that my physique was repulsive.  Even though I loved lifting weights I quit because I couldnt handle being told I was disgusting.Aside from her appearance a large part of Charlottes character addresses her struggle to enjoy being a bloodthirsty berserker while attempting to find love.  For some reason the writers decided that wasnt enough for her and they added a second motivation  that she needs money to send home to her family.  Initially that seems really sweet.  However due to the general lack of world building coupled with some truly horrible dialogue on the part of Charlotte she ends up sounding more like a gold digger than someone who cares about family.  Not to mention everything we learn about Windmire in Birthright would indicate that someone like Charlotte should actually be doing pretty well for herself anyway.  I would have liked to learn more about her family or why being middle class meant they had such a struggle as compared to someone like Effie or Niles or even young Jakob but instead we hear about lunches and trinkets. A couple of her supports end up being rather nice like Leos Bennys and Nyx but her Xander support is abysmal! I think thats unfortunate because they could have supplied each other with what they wanted  the ability to be themselves in a nice private refuge.  Xander wouldnt have to worry about her on the battle field and Charlottes paired ending would actually make sense as I could believe she cares about family as much as Xander does if the gold digger aspect were dropped.  Oh well.  Its still nice they included a character like her I just wish they had fully committed to the idea. ,fireemblem,d8fqaod,12,t5_2t0cn

9240945,0,t1_d8nc9fh,I disagree the alliance is never clearly stronger. In fact the alliance is always shown as somehow weaker than the imperial army commanded by Zelgius. The Laguz only win thanks to clever tactics and their use of special forces the Greil Mercenary. In term of sheer military might the empire is vastly superior.Now sure a military disparity did not stop the Dawn Brigade but that was a guerilla group they struck targets then retreated out of view. And by the time they got big there was no disparity any more the Senator had betrayed Jarod by then so he was not able to use most of his troops. Entering the war as a country would be very dangerous for a newly reformed Daein its small army could not protect the kingdom and fight the empire at the same time so Begnion would be free to send wyvern riders to destroy the country while its army fight.     Anyhow Im probably going too far in my reasoning but my point is that many elements in the game shows us just how powerfull Begnion is. Not to mention most of the previous game is about how Begnion rules the entire continent.,fireemblem,d8ncuya,1,t5_2t0cn

9246013,0,t1_d8nyjej,gt Probably spent much longer than most people on the prologue chapters because of this.Youd be surprised though its more commonly done on HH than H.Chris cant exactly solo the game but theyll be your best unit for a really long time. At this point you can probably promote Chris then carry over your axe rank to dracoknight. Its okay if they end up getting a lot of the kills as long as there are left overs for Marth  a mage  whoever else you intend to use.Training all of the prologue cavs isnt the greatest idea because youll be spreading your EXP too thinly. You can pretty much just drop rodycecille and only train luke if you so wish hell probably end up better in the long term assuming hes still usable now. Also you can keep some units up to par with Drill Grounds use. gt  It seems like first it prioritizes a kill then it looks like it attacks whoever it can deal the most damage toIn some instances they will prioritize greater damage output like ballistas for instance which you can exploit by putting low def units in range to deter the hit.

9292292,0,t1_d8ttu87,Final Fantasy Chrystal Chronicles Dissidia and theatrhythm are all spinoffs of the series... Lets see. CC focuses on crystals a big FF theme and has Moogles and FF spells but is otherwise pretty different while the other two focus primarily on characters from the various games and are overall tributes to the series so lets focus on that. Maybe its because FF tends to deviate in gameplay styles more often that I consider CC a FF spinoff but not FE? Maybe its because FE is nominally a crossover between two series but with the balance tipped so far to one end that its easy to just call it a SMT game? Or maybe I just have a huge double standard because I love Crystal Chronicles and dont care that much about the rest of FF except on an individual level whereas I love FE but dont care for FE. I dunno. That said I do consider the gameplay a core component of FE in a way that I dont so much for FF.,fireemblem,d8tv4wn,2,t5_2t0cn

Servant and Ninja are the only two classes that use the new weapon type so theyre the only ones that need to be kept around but theyre also quite popular.

9386480,0,t1_d95pkwc,Yeah but you said youre looking at endgame grinding this time at which Donnels stat modifiers are only detrimental to. His stat mods not only chip away speed by another  a stat which is critical to a successful Nah but also adds nothing significant at all. All of his mods are either   or  aside from  Lck which is pretty much useless. Compare this to lets say a Mag MU who gives  Mag and  Spd. Thats a  Mag difference and  Spd difference over Donnel!Nah both in extremely significant stats by a significant difference. Aptitude is pretty much the only considerable factor in Donnel but not on Nah. Nowi herself already passes down the nd highest growth modifier in the game so Nah doesnt need aptitude at all. Its much better on other units that struggle with growth modifiers like Kjelle which is why Donnel!Kjelle is pretty much fixed for a given optimization run.,fireemblem,d95sw8x,2,t5_2t0cn

9480897,0,t1_d9hm7w4,Lets look at the similarities between the two of themThey were good guys before being possessed. Lyon just wanted to help people and according to Xander Garon was a fair and kind king if stern and a bit harsh. Lyon was possessed by the Demon King after touching the dark stone. From that point on the Demon King was in control of all his actions. Anytime Lyon acted nicely or kindly was an act by the Demon King to manipulate people. The DKs ultimate goal was to destroy the Sacred Stones in order to revive himself so that he could destroy all of humanity. Why does he do this? Dunno maybe because hes a cartoon villain.Garon get possessed sometime after the Concubine Wars. At that point the demon who possessed him took full control of his body and the demon only continued to act like Garon in order to manipulate the Norhian army to conquer Hoshido for Anankos. Why did the demon need to keep obeying Anankos even though Anankos had little power outside Valla? We dont know. Why did demon Garon want to destroy everything anyway? We dont know. Hes evil because lol why not?Theyre literally the same person. At least Ephraim route Lyon was acting of his own volition. ,fireemblem,d9hq40u,7,t5_2t0cn

The way you fix this? Go into the arena menu dont pay the gold leave the reenter this will make the list go down another number wyou do this  times and the numbers that would be used to determine if you hit and crit are now your opponents and vice versa.

9600896,0,t3_5cg0uq,The summoner class and phantom are incredible due to the sheer fact that you actually have an expendable unit which is a novel concept in Fire Emblem. You can use the phantom as a diversion for scarier units bait for long range attacks along with many other applications.

9602698,0,t1_d9wjznf,Well besides the Royals Corrin and his brotherssisters who are all pretty great all the time pretty much every unit in Conquest has some sort of use which can make them relevant for at least a little bit even if they stop being useful before you finish the game. Therefore it is difficult for me to say who to usenot to use right off the bat.Which units are you planning on using? I can give you some tips on how to best use those characters. ,fireemblem,d9wq93l,1,t5_2t0cn
9603203,0,t1_d9vpocn,Whats your team like?  I tend to try it earlier if possible.  I personally used alot of Xander and Corrin usage to take out multiple guys at  range on EP.  Might need some nice RNG though.  Camilla should be pretty good at taking out guys at range and hammering generals but I dont remember if there are many bow users on the map.  In one playthrough where I did it rather early around chapter  or so my Effie was actually strong enough  overleveled enough to one shot the Generals.Depending on how late you do it I find that paralogues tend to get pretty difficult even on Hard mode.  Forrests Ophelias Siegberts and Percys are pretty difficult for me with Siegberts probably being among the worst for me and I imagine Ignatius is bad as well though I havent ever tried his on lunatic.,fireemblem,d9wshtz,1,t5_2t0cn
9607126,0,t1_d9x8e9o,Been a while since I played SS but try to make your way to Duessel and his group. Keeping the cavaliers alive gets you a nice reward in addition to a promo item from the village near him. The area provides a nice funnel effect since there arent any sea reinforcements to flank apart from the few pirates on the map. If you hold off at your starting position youll have to deal with a bunch of enemies that appear right on top of you on one of the turns. The boats are pretty annoying if you have a flier in their range I never really found them that problematic when I played.Unless youre doing a nogrind run then I would use the tower to level up a few units into promoted and use it to clear most or all of the map make sure to get Cormag though.,fireemblem,d9x9wkg,2,t5_2t0cn

Now I say in concept because yeah generally everyones official art in  looks awful but I definitely think with a better artist and toning down some of the colors just a bit he really would look fine and I dont think the design out of the context of the artist is too bad.

Nyx isnt exactly a long term unit but shes great short term and turns into a good pair up bot while Odins shaky start isnt too hard to fix due to his good availability not to mention that hes pretty good once he actually does get past it due to his weird physicalmagical stats AND gets you his paralogue goodies.Arthur gets you a great kid and hes a great pair up bot along with good availability but his hit Spd and crit issues along with no unpenalized  just dont work for him as the game goes on which is why Id put him below those two.

9868389,0,t3_5go52m,well like the other people said Robin is the best match for anyone really. My personal opinion though is that with a male Robin its best to marry a first gen female since that will generally give you access to two child units instead of one that can pick any class however Lucina is also a strong pick as you can give Morgan the almighty Aether skill and have a generally overpowered Morgan. Female Robin can only produce two children from marrying Chrom which does in fact give you a very powerful and versatile Lucina and Morgan. If you dont like Chrom or married him off before you could form a good strategy for claiming his loins a second gen unit is likely the better choice as you can create a very high stat Morgan through them. Additionally good choices include the shifter classes like Panne and Nowi which gives Morgan access to their respective shifting classes. Bear in mind though that any other unique class units like Olivia and Chrom will NOT give you access to DancerLordect. This rule only applies to shifters,fireemblem,datvgwi,4,t5_2t0cn

9872224,0,t1_dau104h,Effies  mov is irrelevant in chapter . There are plenty of set ups that exist that will allow you to have her visit the first village and cross the river by turn  and engage in combat for turn  before you clear it. Movement only truly matters in chapter  for Silas your first servant and Elise. For anyone else it can be easily mitigated by pairup and unit transferring that youll be doing anyway.In chapter  she has to rely on others to ferry her to combat but there is no real cost to do this and its a good idea to ferry her anyway due to the  def she can give depending on your strategy.Effies  movement in early game does require some strategy to work with but is extremely easy to work around without any real cost. Chapter  is probably the only chapter where it could be an issue if  turns with both chests and not trying to kill Ryoma instead is considered too slow or inefficient for this list.

For late game I may amp it up since itll be a conclusion but since Ive done albums for these routes before I didnt feel like itd be necessary for every little moment.Overall the run has been enjoyable. Sometimes its a bit tedious feeling when getting units and then recruiting them which can take several quick runs of a map to push the day forward to try again. Added with generics always being somewhat around the difficulty level stat wise and never above and it sort of gets annoying at times.I do plan to see this run through though I got some paralogues done to get exp flowing so it hopefully wont be so bad. I miss using Selena oh gawds this change of pace sucks I miss her notable units I favorite to see become amazing.

10100910,0,t3_5kgqdm,Finished a randomized FE playthrough figure Id post the team. Normal mode since I didnt have hard unlocked on this rom. Sorry in advance for the wall o text.Lord Roy  DuhM!Myrmidon Lot  Myrmidon bases combined with bulky growths made for an solid and multitalented guy. Never died and did excellent damage but fell off in the lategame because he was horseless.F!Nomad Chad  Just rammed into his caps as fast as he could. Bases were merely decent but he grew out of it. M!Shaman Lugh  Like regular Lugh but weighed down by Flux. Nosferatu was useful a lot less often than I expected it to be. E staff rank on promotion was an impossible hole to climb out of.Cavalier Clarine  Holy crap this unit. All she needed for the whole game was the early Angelic Robe and she took off. She was a little blessed in Str and capped Spd and Luck super early. A complete powerhouse easy MVP.Brigand Rutger  Hit things decently hard thanks to Brigands getting a good spread of bases. Didnt hit like Gonzales would but you dont really need to.Cavalier Dorothy  The Alan to Clarines Lance. Fast enough to double and slightly stronger and bulkier though  Luck provides bulk on its own. The lesser of the two but still great. Wyvern Wendy  She got a good bump in bases and flight which made her quite something. She was underleveled for a fair while though since I sent her to do errands a lot. She really shined in the lategame with very nice bulk and a nice offensive spread. She got the boots Im not a fan of buying tons of boots in the secret shop so sue me.Pegasus Astore  Good level for the join time decent growths in a good class yes please. Wasnt outrageously fast or strong but he doubled consistently and did good damage.F!Myrmidon Gonzales  Yeah I took him solely for the novelty. He just smashed into F!Swordmasters low Str cap and managed to cap Spd in the final chapter. It was a bad idea to invest in him since I knew I would never need him but I was too tempted to try him out.M!Hero Bartre  He showed up with something like  Spd and  Str. I gave him a Speedwing and let his growths do the rest of the work. Very powerful would use again.F!Sage Percival  Lugh wasnt yet promoted and my only other staff user at that time was Klein so he was an essential part of the team for a while. He had decent bases and A Anima so Aircalibur was the order of the day. Again E staves proved impossible to climb out of but I was so grateful for any healing on a nonKlein body I didnt care. Essential for a while but eventually became filler.F!Bishop Igrene  Out of the entire roster only her and Cleric Zeiss started at anywhere above E rank in staves. Her stats werent super impressive but she proved essential anyway because staff utility is fantastic. Definitely the unit I was most happy to get.Wyvern Lord Niime  Good god even typing that feels broken. She needed an Angelic Robe but otherwise she had great offensive stats decent defenses and a friggin dragon. ,fireemblem,dbo5u72,2,t5_2t0cn

Using tropes is not always bad but theres a right way and a wrong way to use them. What qualifies as right or wrong? Thats a difficult question and the reason why arguments like these arise. But of course Im not saying cut anything and everything because tropes. Thats an indefensible slippery slope strawman.Look Treehouse and I thought the joke was fine because the original Csupport was redundant pedantry some people think were missing something meaningful. You think the BennyBeruka support is the same joke I dont think it is at all. Yes Beruka is not talkative in either support but thats her character. With Benny he was trying to open up to her and it wasnt really even played for comedy? not sure where you got that?. With Saizo it was two edgy stoic assassins sizing each other up in their edgy stoic way. I agreed with someone else in this thread that the transition from the Csupport to the Bsupport could have been done better or existed at all it wouldve only taken like one additional line of dialogue at the start of the B.

You shouldnt feel like a good guy you should face the consequences of your actions and that starts with giving enemy units names and making you feel bad for every one you kill somehow.

Theres an elf that sacrificed her womb to pact with the water and fire spirits but since her entire village was wiped out including her children she went insane. Due to that she developed an affinity for child flesh.Theres a paedophile who only survived the massacre of his family and home because he was in the forest taking care of his urges and then a fairy goads him into killing himself but he chickens out and instead takes a pact with it losing his eyesight. Theres a child whose pact price was his time and as such is eternally a child. He befriends the paedophile unknowing of his particular preferences. Which is just horrifying to think about really.And then theres all the multiple endings which veer off into absolutely crazy shit involving eldritch monsters giant man eating babies with full sets of teeth and even accidental time travel into a modern day future where the protags are eventually shot down by fighter jets and cause some kind of catastrophe which kicks off the events of Nier.And thats just the first Drakengard.I fucking loved those games.,fireemblem,dc7mfe6,5,t5_2t0cn

Rules                  Last Time Roy and Co. managed to kill Zephiel and create the Egg Sacks compass. In the process of making the compass Lot Oiger Dayan and Yodel were killed off Seriously it took the longest for Oiger to get killed off. Brunya managed to escort Idoun over to the temple where she would be able to create tons of war dragons and Roy and Co. give chase. Once Brunya got killed Roy could only take  other people Including Fae with him into the dragon temple in the end Tate and Zealot volunteered to stay behind but they were not voted off. Most of the people that came with Roy took a legendary weapon with them so they could kill dragons and they could one round. Dragons were getting slaughtered while this person called Jahn kept spouting exposition until Jahn was finally killed off. Roy then confronts Idoun and tries to talk her out of it but it was no use and she transformed into the dark dragon.. which got killed in two hits. Roy and Co. manage to escape the now collapsing Dragon Temple with Idoun in tow and Peace has been restored. Roy ended up marrying Lilina and all was well that ended well.

10341160,0,t3_5o29m7,Well the good news is there probably wont be jiggle physics on the characters breasts.In Hyrule Warriors some of the bustier female characters had jiggleboned breasts. Basically a jigglebone is a special bone in a model thats meant to have jiggle physics applied to it. Duh.The Great Fairy Twili Midna Ruto and Cia all had jigglebones in their bust.I know this because jigglebones dont show up properly when you view Hyrule Warriors models and hair and breasts look funky meaning they have jigglebones there.HOWEVER the jigglebones arent actually used in Hyrule Warriors unless someone is more observant than I. And I spent like a solid five minutes staring at Cias and Twili Midnas tits seeing if they moved. For science. Im not memeing  it actually WAS for science. I was gonna stick them on TCRF if they were unused bones.Anyway as far as I know their boobers dont move in Hyrule Warriors. Presumably they made the jigglebones and animated them but a Nintendo higherup said no.Now Intelligent Systems implemented jiggle physics on the characters busts in Awakening and Fates so Im not sure if the Nintendo higherups will care this time around...Did I just do a writeup talking about video game tits?

10391008,0,t3_5ot3by,Quick rundown of eachFE Its the first game in the series aged poorly obviously. Had a semiremake in FE and a full remake titled Shadow Dragon for the DS also known as FE which improved on everything from this game added new charactersmaps DLC and reclassing.FE Hasnt aged well but had so many ideas hat were never brought up again that a remake was expected in due time. It also ties into FE with a few things here and there but your not going to miss out on much if your going to play this or FE Echoes first.FE Earliest entry in the series thats still playable IMO kind of. The map design isnt the most stellar thing for Book . It introduces new mechanics such as dismounting the absurd Again staff brings back FEs cast apart from like  units RIP Wrys and adds new characters to the mix. Also items called star shards named after zodiac signs would alter unit growth rates making pretty much everyone viable its also the biggest change for FE to its remake.FE Remake of FE that brings back the unused characters from FE characters introduced in FE the new units from FE reappearances of BSFE characters and some new ones. Largest playable cast in the series with almost  units. It also brings with it a side stories with first ever playable and even worse then CQ!Corn and Robin combined Avatar Kris is the generic name used when talking about them though. Ugh. And he has a side plot dedicated to him. Everyone hates him. Its also the first game to introduce barracks Awakening style and most importantly Casual mode. Star shards are now flat buffs to the unit holding them. BSFE Slightly touched on before but first ever spinoff to the series maps are OK. Nothing special. Kind of like a prequel to book  but whatever it doesnt matter.FE Maps are massive making it probably one of the more lopsided in the likedislike it department. Having the hands down best story in the series by a long shot introducing the weapon triangle a game spanning generations kids mechanic is here too and FuryFurryFerryErinErinys its definitely its own thing. But its really good at what it does and what it wants.FE Pinnacle of human achivement its the hardest game in the series though. Also the translation is still in hieroglyphs for some dialogue so no comment on the story. ,fireemblem,dclvx48,2,t5_2t0cn

Id recommend starting there or Fates Conquest if you think youre good at games its harder and a little more satisfying. I wouldnt recommend Birthright because its very easy or the GBA games because its harder to appreciate their charm as a first game unless you grew up playing GBA games. The three versions of Fates tell different versions of the story. Buy one first play it and buy the others if you enjoyed it.

10406526,0,t3_5oycas,Not really. Mario and Pokemon had many spinoffs and are still going strong. It helps they have other developers work on those games too just like Fire Emblem is doing with Koei for FE Warriors and they given Atlus the reigns for TMS.TMS is a guilty pleasure kind of a game for me and open doors to spinoffs. Just like not everyone is going to get into Mario olympic games  other spinoffs not everyone is going to get into TMS or the new game coming out FE Warriors but they made it. Remember they said FE is going to be their major IP along with Zelda Mario and Pokemon.Add in the fact that these games are either on the Switch or DS  NDS and you have another audience that get to play an FE game if they only have one of those.Heroes will open doors to the smartphone audience and maybe peak their interest to try out the games on consoleshandheld.This is also good so we have something to play while we wait for a mainline game like the one announced for the Switch in  if we wanted an FE fix.,fireemblem,dcnnbcj,1,t5_2t0cn

10474390,0,t3_5q0368,First and foremost Meg my favorite character from Radiant Dawn. OK half of that is that I consider the Greil Mercenaries as so integrally from PoR so it just doesnt feel right to call Rhys or Mist my favorite RD character but either way Meg is overlooked even by her own game! Shes just so happy and devoted. Fortunately Tokyo Mirage Sessions Mamori takes all that I love about Meg and actually expands on it but Mamori is quite wellloved so she doesnt really fit this topic.Though now that I mention Rhys the Tellius healers Rhys and Laura feel really overlooked Rhys is probably the Greil Mercenary whos least talked about and Laura well I blame RDs support system for that. But theyre just both so devoted and loyal. Mist I also like but I cant call her overlooked.Next I have to mention the trio of Awakening mages of Miriel Ricken and Laurent. I think not many people hate on them but not many people love them personalitywise but Miriel and Laurents super analytical speech and mannerisms are so great DESIST AT ONCE! and Rickens wanting to become older and more mature feels somewhat relatable.Finally theres the pair of cavaliers from FE Lowen and Isadora. Lowen I like more for gameplay since he has wonderful defenses and with his high move you can let him charge forward and plop onto a choke point generally without fear of death his loyalty and willingness to do better is great too though.

10523532,0,t1_dd0veqr,Most ideas that IntSys has are actually good but its the writing that fails the ideas not the other way around.Having a game where the main character is a self insert WITHOUT the use of branching dialogue options means the character that is meant to represent you will almost never actually represent what you would do. For example in whatever chapter you fight Yen Fay on would YOU have had the idea to run up a fucking volcano and fight there? No that wasnt your idea it was Robins. That being said Robin was different and better when compared to Corrin he had a personality that could be defined and because he supported with everyone he could show off a bunch of different sides of that personality. Corrin is WAY worse Corrin is meant to represent you meaning he should be able to reclass into anything so you can be whatever you want the problem is that hes also the lord you should NEVER be able to reclass your lord itd be like promoting your king in Chess itd make the  unique piece on the field become something that has a duplicate. It creates this conflict of interest where Robin shouldnt be the main lord as itd be dumb gameplay wise but to have him be ALMOST a lord as he is in Awakening makes it awkward from a story telling perspective.gt I felt like I was more important to the outcome of the game rather than just sitting back and watching it happen.You can do that just as much as if you played as the military advisor as you do in FE you play as Oifey until he leaves then you play as Sigurd for like half a chapter before you go onto Seliph for the rest of the game FE also had difficulties trying to make Marth and Kris share a spotlight its not just an Awakening problem its one with having a Lord and a Self insert. Thats my point overall its that you dont need to have a self insert to feel like youre making an impact on the story and having a Lord and a self insert is dumb story wise whilst having the self insert be the lord is just a stupid idea gameplay wise.,fireemblem,dd0yfm1,1,t5_2t0cn

E and that rice burning one in part  come to mind and thats not including his contribution to every other chapter hes in He ALSO wields the best type of weapons in RD axes. Seriously look at the stats of RDs hand axe javelin and wind edge its dumb how far ahead the hand axe is and thats not counting the other axes he has access togt sigurds definitely dominant but i still feel like the fact that he doesnt contribute at all to half the game has to weigh him down at least a little bit.Firstly he kinda does he passes down what could be a paragon ring a  kill silver sword and a possible light brand with  kills.

10594942,0,t1_dd8rovo,gtsometimes in Fire Emblem using everything at your disposal is not the best way to win.Of course but we shouldnt close options arbitrarily.gtOften its better to focus on a small number of units to win.This is actually only true for new players. As an experienced player this doesnt hold up when you start putting a lot of thought into your strategies.gtConquest meanwhile has other considerations. I already mentioned Chapter . Chapters   and  have a time limit  not an implicit you lose this reward time limit but a straightup game over.These maps are exactly why there is a problem in your way of thinking as they are all very easy if you play normally and are only difficult when you start adding your exceptions because FE is not a game designed to be played with them. Its very easy to cheese chapter  on normal by just putting four meat shields on the exit point. The time limit maps arent any more difficult than a normal map if you are using everything you have available. The only reason the time limits get to you is because you are getting bottlenecked which wouldnt be a problem if you were using more units. Even then its not impossible to solo them as Ive done it before and it was pretty easy.,fireemblem,dd8sbm5,2,t5_2t0cn

10629147,0,t3_5s4kh1,Hey I changed the PMU from POR to Awakening Hard Mode Blind Run. If you could change it on the last thatd be great So I finally beat Chapter  today. Basically involved Viron paired up with Frederick weakening the enemy and getting some good levels along the way and Stahl Sully pairup or Vaike Miriel pairup finishing them off. Lissa tagged along for healing. Stahl got a great level up. Vaike got a level up in Magic....Robin and Chrom are still great units. Robin is a bit squishy but shes been getting great level ups so far! Same with Chrom as well. I really like using Virion and Stahl as well.Looking back at the units I was given Im sure Bow Knight Chrom and Sniper!Ricken were a troll pick. So Chrom will continue to be a Lord and Ricken may just remain a mage if hes worth raisingBy the end of Chapter  these were the supportsChrom x Robin BsupportVirion x Frederick ClevelStahl x Sully ClevelThanks for reading!,fireemblem,ddcbdk7,2,t5_2t0cn

The way that auto battle is currently used doesnt have any meaning for the concept because were it implemented that could affect a change in the way people play the game. And its the start of a concept not a complete statement. Personally I would either limit it to a different mode altogether or somehow rebalance states to adjust. For example from this same line of thinking you could also broach the concept of greater changes to the support system will a character become outraged if their spouse is struck down in battle AKA get a combat boost AKA go super saiyan or will losing them cause them to fall into depression AKA a stat loss. Im only interested in discussing the concept and thinking of loose ways to implement it. ,fireemblem,dddhghu,1,t5_2t0cn

10654946,0,t1_dddr6t5,Ive got no good explanation for Flavia unless she was designed as a Mercenary rather than a Hero I guess but thats a shot in the dark but you really cant argue that Minervas armor is practical. Concealing yes but not practical. Nearly every aspect of it is ornamental as fuck.Cherche might get eviscerated from behind which she probably would anyway since the only thing that would ever hit her from behind would be an arrow but thats neither here nor there but at least she can swing her axe without catching anything on her own tripledecker pauldrons.Anyway my point is basically that yes there is a noticeable lean towards greater sexualization but theres no reason thats inherently worse since FE character designs have always been stylized and kind of silly.,fireemblem,ddez4yz,1,t5_2t0cn

10674244,0,t3_5sojb6,Split route or split game? Split route can easily be an entire game with multiple choices and multiple endings ex Super Robot Wars games. Split game is practically Fates already. If you go the pokemon route instead of the fates route then it is the exact same story with some version exclusive characters but minus the trading mechanic which kind of defeats the part of the purpose for making two versions.I prefer split route so even if you choose one side or the other you still have a chance to recruit characters from the other side. Who you can recruit will be route based and can make players replay the game to see who they can recruit if they choose differently from their previous playthrough. Also route split allows you to choose which ending route youll end up on.As for the story its practically Gundam Unicorns events using Fates characters and setting. This basically means that Corrin and Azura are neutral characters who also happen to be the macguffinsVIPs that both sides are fighting over. Nohr wants more farmable land and Garon knows that having Corrin and Azura will allow access to Valla for said land. Of course they attack Hoshido to grab Corrin but Hoshido grabs Azura in retaliation. Hoshido has no idea about Valla aside from Mikoto and fights Nohr to get back Corrin and repel them from their lands. In the meanwhile Anankos is working behind the scenes and manages to hijack Garons body and his plans and changes them to killing everyone who knows of or is related to Valla so that no one can stop the strife he is intentionally sowing. You can have the NohrHoshidoVall endings including a ruin ending which uses that comic posted the other day where Azura is actually the villain.,fireemblem,ddgyuf8,1,t5_2t0cn

I like both of them Shadow Approaches for that great GBA soundfont paired with slow impending music but I also like the upbeatness of Chapter . Nostalgias gonna win this one the GBA soundfont is too good to vote against.L  WOAH this song is great. Immediately grabs you and takes you for a ride. Really wanna hear this remastered in Echoes. Although Greil Mercenaries is great too. Theyre kinda similar. A fast part at the front to grab your attention and then slows down into a mellow part midway through. This one is really tough but Im gonna give it to FE.L  Advance takes it. Nothing against Distant Roads but it was always my least favourite SS map theme.L  That GBA soundfont coming back with another doomy track. And its another oceans grey waves song. Goes to the one that doesnt reuse the same song  different times.L  Im actually strapped for time at the moment so I wasnt able to listen to as much as I usually do for this one but from the  seconds I can fit in FE takes it Went back and listened to them longer and I think No Justice takes it just barely.,fireemblem,ddmjh1a,3,t5_2t0cn

10815996,0,t1_dduoqy5,The LehranDheginsea dynamic is possibly my favorite story point in the entire series theres a whole level of depth there that very little else approaches. I think they demonstrate the Tellius themes of order amp chaos and the nature you are born with vs the actions you take better than anyone. Dheginsea is a dragon. Among other things dragons are the beings in Tellius most susceptible to the force of chaos. And Dheginsea has seen first hand the dangers of uncontrolled chaos I mean he survived the flood. All of his actions after that are a fight against chaos he defeats the god of chaos orders his people into strict neutrality and isolation to avoid conflict refuses to aid his fellow laguz because of it. Would you see all of Tellius awash in blood? In a way he is trying to fight chaos out of a fear of his own chaotic nature. But chaos is not his downfall. His problems come from his obsession with order. The other laguz lose respect for him when he fails to take action against slavery. He loses two of children because his oppressive policies drive Almedha away. And of course when the goddess of order decides to destroy the world he is completely resigned to it. As someone Tibarn? says without a healthy dose of chaos you become complacent. And as Nasir says though he blames Almedha Dheginsea had long been suffering alone because of his decisions. Lehran of course is a heron most attuned to the force of order. But from the earliest actions we know of he is advocating for chaos. Hes the one who begs Ashera to spare Yune and hes the one who originally kept her company in her imprisonment. He urged Dheginsea to fight and free the slaves and was determined to improve the lives of the laguz regardless of the cost. He is characterized as quite progressive and growth is one of the characteristics of Yune. But he succumbs to madness and despair from the world around him. I would say his demise is from chaos. ,fireemblem,ddvlduv,6,t5_2t0cn

10835087,0,t1_ddx9daw,Ill argue for FE Marth.This operates under the idea that the Lord as a character undergoes growth as a person and as a unit is relevant through the entire game but is never centralizing. Marths character growth stems from being oft challenged and forced into maturity when everyone including himself know that hes not ready for the trails. The easiest example of this is the end of the prologue conversation he has with either Jagen or Draug depending if Jagen lived. In that conversation he reflects upon his situation where all he has is a handful of loyal knights and a boat to a supposedly safe kingdom of Tyls. He beats himself up over losing family calling himself craven. All his council can do there is to try to provide a little comfort while their lord is almost to tears. Later on he deals with trails from uniting with Hardin to liberating Archanea facing villains representing his personal trials Garhnef and destiny Medeus. From the beginning where he cant help but call himself craven to the end where Nyna comments that his nerves have only failed him in the relm of love tip make sure caeda lives.. Marth the character resides in the goldylocks zone of great development competence and punished for mistakes that his community idealizes.Marth the unit comes no where near the dominance of Ephraim Sigurd or Ike yet still manages to fulfill useful roles like chest looting or forged rapier boss nukes. Having a decidedly overpowered lord can overcentralize the game and dumb it down like awakening where common strategies revolving consist of just make Robin solo it yet Marth doesnt quite fall to the frustrations of Roy where he lies plagued by terrible bases frustrating growths and having his potential locked to a pitiful number of maps and unlike many lords Marth has an unusual boon thanks to the prevalence of Warp in FE which allows him to overcome his shortcomings in mobility.FE Marth is awesome and a well designed lord.,fireemblem,ddxk9vi,13,t5_2t0cn

Perhaps an obscure scifi reference but kind of like how  Foundation and Empire by Isaac Asimovs The Mule in Foundation and Empire can   forcibly influence peoples emotions and thus control them. Bonus points that his musical instrument the VisiSonor that he plays in his guise as Magnifico the Clown can be used to powerfully enhance this effect of emotional control and influence.   Making an analog through music to Azuras singing producing such control in this hypothetical.  This also has a convenient way for explaining away Corrins plot stupidity.... theyve been being controlled by the mastermind Azura all along until the end.  ,fireemblem,de04b29,26,t5_2t0cn

By endgame youre just sitting there wondering why the hell the game was so boring without realizing that by only using one mon youve effectively put the game on easy mode. Same goes for using less units or just using Gunter in general. Not only that but the guy is way less versatile than many of the units in the game. Plus the fact that in Revelations he doesnt even give Corrin support bonuses which makes him inferior to most other units by default anyway since not only can they do FPs job better by pairing up with him but they can also just up his stats way higher than Gunter will ever be able to. At the end of the day outside of one or two chapters where you only have  or  units Gunter just sucks. ,fireemblem,dedcb1c,11,t5_2t0cn

Well at least until Lunitic happened but we dont talk about that. Hell even Eilwood hard mode doesnt even come close to it. I will agree with you though that Oswin is great though and is a large part of why I love the class but he isnt the one whos my flare so I guess that shows who I strictly prefer.Okay suppose I humor your assumption that nonHHM FE is as easy as SS.Guess what? Oswin is a better unit than Gilliam anyway. They have nearidentical growths Gilliam has  more StrSkl growth while Oswin has  more Res growth and identical availability in their games except Oswin Joins at higher level with higher base stats and weapon rank Has better level  base stats than Gilliam even has when he levels to level  Has less good early game units competing with him for investment near his join time  chapters   gaidens before Lyns group rejoins so only Lowen competes for investment while for Gilliam Franz joins at the same time Vanessa  chapter later and Artur  chapters after thatIm still failing to see any metric by which Gilliam is a better unit.,fireemblem,dejipx2,1,t5_2t0cn

11050922,0,t1_dekl9dw,Thats... exactly why hed fit to be an avatar! Im not saying he should be the center of the story Im just saying he should be optionally customizable. The fact that hes around for both generations makes him suitable for it.In Gen  the player could have the option of making him playable or not right away. If they dont want to thats fine. He retains the same role and you dont control him in gameplay. If they do thats fine too. He still retains the same role only this time you can choose which class he starts with essentially starting out as a trainee. He functions as a regular unit albeit a weaker one and then leaves and comes back for Gen . If the player decided not to make him playable in the first generation then he joins as his regular default paladin self. Otherwise he joins as the promoted version of whatever class he started out with still filling the same role as before.Like I get not liking the whole customizable unit but I feel like you didnt really give any reason not to give him the avatar role. ,fireemblem,deklpsj,3,t5_2t0cn

But they are not enough to break the game.Back to forging you can spend k and minimal time gathering minerals and get  Might. Still too much? How about k for  Might? The scaling with forging is off. You can get a lot of Might very easily with the initial levels. The extent that can break the game is not comparable to anything else.  attack is like  levels for the best characters.

But for now most animations make due with less because of the practicality of D animation over D. For games that ideally means more money and time spent on the game itself to ensure its high quality.Truth be told I was genuinely shocked that we got so much animated material to begin with for this game considering its close release date and the Switch foolhardily pushing to replace the DS makes it seem like it may have been a backburner project like Sacred Stones was during PoRs development.,fireemblem,derrvnw,1,t5_2t0cn

11197669,0,t3_5zu1mu,I actually quite liked this stage. Overall its kind of just a standard Conquest map but for whatever reason this stage was particularly memorable to me above others after completing Conquest.Anyway regarding the outlaw hes a good incentive to not just aggro literally one enemy per turn or something ridiculously turtly but otherwise hes just a vague push. Hes also an incentive to funnel everyone over to the left and ignoring Takumi and company at the right.The wyvern riders that charge at you though along with Takumis free movement across all accessible terrain makes it kind of scary when you think youre safe behind a river and a bridge halfsurrounded by trees on the right side and then all of the sudden enemies start crossing these barrier you thought was safe.Benny and Charlotte really shine in this chapter  especially Bennys specialization as a defensive wall. Once you take care of Orochi and her backup diviners Benny can plop down and with a healer safely behind him or a couple vulneraries equipped can pretty effectively tank much of the rest of the map. He and Effie were the first knights I used in any game since I didnt use Kellam in FE or Oswin in FE  I think something about Conquests map designs maybe something about having more chokepoints like the bridges or spaces between houses in this chapter? Is that actually a thing with the map designs in this game or is it just my conception? or maybe character balance or at least something makes knights feel a lot more useful than in other games.Finally this isnt maprelated but I have to say FECQs Scarlets death was the most impactful one for me in all of Fates  and honestly maybe the Fire Emblem series as a whole. Her death is the first serious death of a major character and shows you that even though you may have successfully spared everyone up to this point you wont always be able to. The fact that she was made an example by the Nohrians really made the mood dark and Garons threat much more real. Admittedly the story may also have contributed to why this stage was memorable to me. But either way this isnt a chapter story discussion so Ill leave it at that.,fireemblem,df18qcg,7,t5_2t0cn
11198620,0,t3_5zu1mu,The gates on both sides make this chapter relatively easy because those mage with orochi will suicide into your mage killers so only maximum three units are needed on the left side. Corrin and Effie can wall the other side meanwhile Benny and Charlotte can protect your weak units from those WyvernKnight combo. Once you clear the right side and engage Reina from this side then there should be no problem.All in all this chapter has a fun start but the outlaw doesnt work that well. There is no need to turtle once you clear Reinas squad because the reinforcement only comes after you engage the boss and the outlaw will eventually walks out of Scarlets range.,fireemblem,df1cm2o,3,t5_2t0cn

11238362,0,t1_df5u9pv,I think its because Robin is extremely disappointing in many regards. His only viable option is to go as an archer where he can use that Skill and Luck effectively. Gray can have some leeway into being a cavalier although Mercernary is his best bet. Cliff can literally make any class work. I had him as my knight one playthrough and he was the best Baron on my team. Just gave him the Gladius for the final map and he kicked so much ass. Seriously Cliff was a knight doubling most things except for Slayers and Gold Knights. Then I had him as a Mercenary all the way to Slayer and once again Cliff kicked a lot of ass. While his bases are awful in comparison Gaiden is a game where bases can be circumvented via promotion. What separates Cliff from the others is that Cliff is much more likely to level up speed health and defense which when hes about to promote hell likely be ahead of the game. Especially since promoting is just bring your stats straight to whatever the class is meant to have. Either way gaining strength is much more viable in Gaiden as some enemies will just naturally have sky high defenses. Its just that in comparison to all the other units Gray is more likely to provide something to the team whilst Robin will not. Archers in Gaiden were really hit or miss. Also I do believe that Gray will end up with more defense than Robin which just helps Grays argument as a more useful unit. ,fireemblem,df5uott,2,t5_2t0cn

Given that this is a remake theyre going to pander to older fans and this comment is aimed at luring them back by saying one of the most criticised mechanics among older fans has no place in this game. And yes Pair Up is heavily criticised. They already acknowledged this in their interviews that led up to the release of Fates. This is simple fact. They acknowledged the criticism and attempted to fix it. It was criticised much less in Fates but its far from perfect. Now theyre just lighly poking fun and acknowledging this. This wont affect sales negatively as the fans who liked it arent going to be so affronted by the comment that they wont buy the new game but older fans will definitely take interest due to it.gtIf theyre taking a jab at pair up then theyre also taking a larger jab at archers as well yet for some reason that fact is being ignored.Oh theyre definitely taking a jab at archers as well.

The little advantage male mages will have is the new Sage class skills.Also many units got buffed so I wont trust on gaiden sterotypes for this one. Yes Alm and Celica will dominate it all but many other good units may show very good not only by growth rates but with class flexibility  weapon skills.  Yes Faye compensates her somethat subpar growths with flexibility but funny you mention Again spell. We still havent confirmation of what it does even it being implied its a dance effect.Also Alm route already have  clerics.

So arguing that you arent excited for it because its a remake isnt very logical considered you likely have never played the original. Its still a very old game with a much different design philosophy than Im used to. Especially off the heels of Conquest If they made a a remake of Final Fantasy  Id have the same thought.Ive played  and . I got to chapter  of SD twice before dropping it and chapter  of  before dropping it. They didnt appeal to me as much. Very slow and required a lot of dogpiling and strategic position that I admit was fun at first but got tedious as maps got bigger. Those are the classics I lump Gaiden with.

Conquest was good but BRRev were pretty ez and the hard modes werent anything special. Awakenings Lunatic was fun for the first  maps so much kiting but after that it kind of fell apart even without grindingdlc. There are definitely some points OP raises that are negative and would point towards a worse balanced version i.e. nerf all the okay units as well as some issues showing that the team was too reliant on nostalgia instead bringing the game forward. And chapter  being a slog sounds pretty horrible.That being said Gaiden was a pretty meh game the fan dubs version isnt what Id call a great time compared to PoRRDConquest. Geneaology as a remake has a lot more potential considering its a game I still play often today despite the graphics being suck. Though if they managed to tank that somehow then again Revelations Id probably not invest.

11515619,0,t3_64da6p,Hes a competent combat unit and nd best villager due to his bases prior to Thief Shrine and transitions into best combat unit in Ch.  after going Mercenary. Gray gets dibs on the Lightning Sword in FE Hard because enemy AS is higher so Alm cant always double with it while Merc!Grey can with class bases. He cant ORKO with it though with enemy HPbulk increase as early as Southern Zofia but he leaves enemy HP low enough for others to take the kill though he should also be getting fair bit of EXP for Myrmidon promotion before the end of Ch.  preferably by the end of Deliverance Hideout. This gives a nice boost to AS as well as  mov so is desired asap.He continues to do Lightning Sword shenanigans very well until Ch.  midgame and remains one of Alms best combat unit. After you reach the Forgery one can forge a Steel Sword into a Silver Sword  which has  Mt  Hit and  Wt. It costs  silver coins but this is manageable after converting some of the alcoholic drinks provided in the game into silver coins. The Lightning Swords usefulness starts to wane at this point due to enemy HP and Res so he should start transitioning to the Silver Sword forge though the former could be more helpful in certain situations. He can then ORKO Arcanists and the like and if he gets lucky with Atk he can ORKO some physical enemies as well. He should reach Lv.  before the end of Forest Shrine allowing him to promote to Dread Fighter which gives him a very good AS boost as well as decent bulk boost to HP and  Mov.He has some trouble ORKOing enemies from late C but his decent Atk and outstanding Spd base from Dread Fighter should still allow him to do good enough damage to enemies. Res  and Spirit Ward halves damage from magic also helps take magic to the face in enemy phase as well which is neat.Overall probably the best combat unit out of the villagers and one of Alms best unit.,fireemblem,dg1ap6v,11,t5_2t0cn

11533446,0,t1_dg30cg2,While I definitely agree with you about there being elitists online particularly youtube I do think its worth noting that theres nothing wrong with disliking some games in the series or disagreeing with design choices.  You dont have to like every aspect of the series to be a healthy FE fan.  I think its a bit natural for people to prefer the mechanics and styles of certain games over others.  And criticisms of things you dont like is one of the cornerstones of online discussion.  The big problem comes when you start insulting people based on their subjective taste.  For instance Ill admit I am really not a fan of the three routes of Fates.  And I could rant about the problems I had with those games all day.  But I have never been called an elitist nor do I personally consider myself one because I never judge people who like those titles.  Games are art and while there are a lot of objective qualities in art that merit criticism the experiences of an individual with a piece of art are dependent on that individuals personality life experiences and so much more.  To me elitists are people who care less about discussing the game itself and more about using games as an intermediate to make themselves feel better i.e. my favorite game is better than yours therefore I am bettersmarter than you,fireemblem,dg3bgwr,3,t5_2t0cn

ShurikenfaireBowfaire from the relevant class depending on which one i stop at. Dragon Ward seems like itd be nice as well. does that sound like an OK idea? I could get Aether for lulz too id have to decide who to get up as supports to get all those classes...  i heard you should reclass Jakob ASAP but i was wondering if waiting until he gets Tomebreaker is a good idea or not and how useful that even is. he seems like the obvious choice for a pairup partner for the avatar due to his personal skill. if Tomebreaker generally isnt worth it should i go GK or PLD? or do something like GK to Luna reclass to PLD. PLD seems to be a better option for pairup for PriestessMaid unless someone else has a better character to use as a pairup buddy. are there any units in BR that i should reclasschange class ASAP because they just dont plain fit with their default class? ive heard Mozu should go Archer literally in the chapter you get her Hinoka should go Spearfighter and... thats it. something about Azama wanting to go to a physical class? a on that note is Sniper!Mozu her best option?

11633067,0,t1_dgejch3,Agreed with the other reply than mine that states that this feels like it comes from a heavy LTC perspective. For the vast majority of players clearing E on Turn  is really not a high priority. And with turning things not being the priority in mind a rout chapter basically becomes Ryoma takes the  on the left Saizo takes the  on the right and hit turn until the chapter is over for nonoptimal play. For efficient play that comes short of LTC I find them to be rather large annoyances more than anything. random idiot in bum nowhere usually means arbitrarily requiring me to bring more units than I would otherwise need to or at least training more than I would need to. I think the bigger problem with rout maps is that like Ive stated in my other recent comment  I think any objective is inherently neutral but in practice rout maps either exist in the easiest games of the franchise or in games that give you units like Haar or Jill and there really isnt any inbetween. ,fireemblem,dgemcs4,3,t5_2t0cn
