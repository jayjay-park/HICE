2021622,0,t1_ckws4hz,I learned something as well  youre the first person Ive talked to whos been so low on ball. its made me think twice. I have no idea how you choose from  rbs every week. I have  and my flex spot has been an issue every week. It clouds my decision making process. If were going to start considering sources of information I would say bleacher report is one of to weary of as well. For what its worth nfl.com and espn.com have ball in around the top  ROS as well if I recall correctly. Best of luck!,ffbuddies,ckwsvt6,1,t5_33pqe
