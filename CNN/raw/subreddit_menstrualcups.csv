2166278,0,t3_2jtt25,I had the same exact experience.  Inserting was never an issue seemed to be sealed. Would seem to last a little and then bam it would leak.  One reader suggested a firmer cup I did a lot of research and just ordered a meluna medium sport version  its one of the firmest. One reader said if your cervix is literally sitting in the cup a semifull cup is an overflowing one Another thing to consider is if you are active if you have a high or low cervix etc.  I will keep you posted on the success of my new one! ,menstrualcups,clf6n8p,2,t5_2st5x
2794765,0,t1_cnlqp38,Thank you so much for the reply. My cervix sits pretty low during the first couple of days so this sounds like and excellent tip!,menstrualcups,cnlr5z6,1,t5_2st5x
3887117,0,t3_34xu2r,Menstrual cups are more difficult to insert than a tampon no doubt about it. It will take a few cycles to get the hang of it but once you do its easy. A cup with a short learning curve that is very easy to insert and remove is the Sckoon cup. It is one of the most flexible cups on the market its made of medical grade silicon. DO NOT try a diva cup first they are very stiff and too long and large. Many women have bad experiences with them and then they are put off of using menstrual cups. The Sckoon is a good one to start with along with maybe Lunette. You will find your goldilocks cup!,menstrualcups,cqzd5i8,4,t5_2st5x
4382250,0,t1_csj8z48,Oh ok. Thanks!  I was on this site and it wouldnt even let me put in a Canadian address. Just ordered from the EU site!Ill try the lube...I would really prefer one that is soft enough to do without so thats why Im going to try the Meluna classic I believe the soft will be too soft. ,menstrualcups,csjm6c1,1,t5_2st5x
4474267,0,t3_3cdtou,My average since I started using cups five years ago is  ml. If I only average the last  months its  ml. I have a spreadsheet. I nerd like this.For the record I still consider my flow to be somewhat on the light side even as its gotten a big heavier over the years. Its been postulated at the livejournal cup community that the number only considers blood while menstrual fluid contains lots of other stuff too plasma tissue etc.Also there was this great poll several years ago polling cup users and their flow. Youre not alone! Many others have periods just as heavy and heavier! Theres also this new super high capacity cup called the Super Jennie that has a capacity of  ml which hey looks like its available for purchase now! Its only . Im kind of impressed. But if you already have a high capacity cup the Super Jennie probably wont add that much time in between changes. ,menstrualcups,csunih9,2,t5_2st5x

4739494,0,t3_3fu13p,While I do rinse my cup in my own sink at home before reinserting when Im in a public restroom I just give it a quick swipe with some tp and its good to go! And I always dump the actual contents into the toilet no matter where I am. So I think you could avoid any awkwardness in the dorm restrooms for the most part and maybe find a single bathroom or handicap stall with a sink elsewhere on campus occasionally to rinse it more thoroughly.  As for the boiling... That is a bit more tricky since it is important. I think your best bet is to just either not share your kettle or get a separate one. Unless its possiblesafe to microwave a cup to boil it?! ,menstrualcups,ctryh9e,5,t5_2st5x
5150053,0,t1_cv6pjpk,Well Im no gynecologist but I can tell you how I found mine and did basic measurements.First consider which position is easiest for you.  Lying propped up on your back is one option as is a squat but a squat tends to assist in pushing things down which isnt necessarily a realistic measure of the vaginal barrel.  Maybe try the old one foot on a stool or toilet.Next lube a finger or two and insert gently.  Start at the first joint in and follow the walls of your vagina in a circular motion.  There is variation in the texture of your vaginal walls but what youre looking for is a little firmer.  Its often been described as kind of like the tip of your nose with a dimple in the middle.  Keep increasing the depth of your finger and moving your finger in a spiral pattern so you end up mapping the contours of your vaginal walls.Generally the cervix should be towards the end of your vagina and somewhat upwards.  There is quite a bit of variation though so dont be surprised if you find it angled slightly to the right or left or even inverted.  When you find the nobbly nose type texture explore its couture and how it sits in relation to the rest of your vagina.  This should give you an idea of how its angled.  Take not of how deep your finger is.  Measure your finger with a ruler if you like but its not exact science Compare the depth of your vagina to your cup.  If your cervix is much shallower than the cup you may have issues.  If you cant find or maybe reach your cervix try a squat position.  This wont be as good a measure of length but it will give you the angle so you know what to aim for.If none of this works Id strongly suggest that you just try to wear your cup lower.  Insert it only so its just in.  Remove the stem if it irritates.Also dont forget to make sure the cup is fully expanded.  If it is not then put a finger in alongside the wall where the cup is compressed.  Pull you vaginal wall wider gently to break the seal and allow the cup to pop open release fully and then do the twist to reestablish the seal.,menstrualcups,cv6rwrd,1,t5_2st5x
6284051,0,t3_41kbla,I think the firmness and thickness of the Mooncups rim might be more likely the cause of the pressure sensation youve described not really the rim diameter per se. Id go with the MeLuna medium since its closer in length to your Mooncup. I wouldnt want you to have a tough time reaching your cup for removal. How was it removing the Mooncup when you had it? Could you reach for the base of the cup easily? Because MeLuna medium will be mm shorter by cup length not including the stems and the small would be mm shorter than your old cup.,menstrualcups,cz3xc5m,1,t5_2st5x

6403209,0,t3_43djwq,If you have an average length cervix most cups would work well for you. Maybe start with a cup thats not too soft and not too firm. If you prefer silicone material Fleurcup DivaCup Sckoon Lunette etc. If you like TPE theres MeLuna.You could compare the length of the cups to your cervix height in this link Dont get the tiniest cup just because you have no kids. Get the cup thatll fit you AND is easy for you to reach when you bear down for removal,menstrualcups,czhha90,1,t5_2st5x

7323230,0,t3_4fo2fz,Stick a finger up there.Sorry but thats really the best way. Mine is tilted as well and Ive noticed that the cup will also tilt and adjust itself in line with my cervix.As for your second question my guess is either  the cup is too firm for you or  its not in the right place and pressing against your cervix causing discomfort.,menstrualcups,d2aln8k,2,t5_2st5x

7600471,0,t3_4jdsqj,I usually remove my cup while sitting on the toilet. If your cup is out of reach just bear down a little and you should be able to reach it. I use two fingers to pinch the bottom of the cup to break the seal then grab the stem to pull it out. No big deal just a little practice.,menstrualcups,d364vme,3,t5_2st5x
7607775,0,t1_d2syqdc,Hi sorry for the late reply back at reddit!Im going to bed with an empty cup and a good seal. I didnt think the cup was traveling at all but Im not super sure.

7953903,0,t3_4lt7jd,Ever since I heard of them I became curious. I wanted one but didnt know which one to pick. I thought about buying a diva cup since I saw it in the store sometimes. Glad I didnt! I think it would have been too firm for me. I somehow came across preciousstarspads videos and watched them for about a month. By then I felt like I knew enough to choose wisely so I bought one and it was a really hard process for me to get used to it but I looooove it now. Took about  months of feeling like Id wasted my money but now Ive been using it over a year. ,menstrualcups,d4a3dbu,1,t5_2st5x
8471903,0,t1_d605lg5,Thank you so much for sharing. The ph balancing suppositories is a great tip I never knew that existed!I had my first vaginal yeast infection just over a month ago. I was googling how to tell the difference in yeast and bv but it was muddy to me. I actually figured out that I got yeast from my child who put a pacifier in his mouth belonging to a baby who had oral thrush. It was not fun and involved bleaching everything we touched.Im somehow still paranoid about yeast and bv. As if they could still be hanging around. I keep doing a dipstick test and sniffing lol and no smell and no discharge but I just cant shake worrying about it.,menstrualcups,d60j1fg,1,t5_2st5x
8634087,0,t3_4y3h6n,Its hard to recommend a cup since there are so many nowadays. This list isnt even up to date with newer cups like Super Jennie Lena etc. Which brandstyle you prefer depends on your anatomy and preference. I can tell you that I prefer silicone cups over MeLunas TPE but it might be different for you.This video by Precious Stars is a decent guide to help you narrow down your options. I like this video by Red Herring that shows different stylesshapes of various cup brands.What size are you looking at? Keep in mind that MeLunas medium is more comparable to Lunettes small.,menstrualcups,d6kv9gq,1,t5_2st5x

10099916,0,t1_dbo0oij,Sounds like a plan! I much prefer the ball on my meluna than the cut stem I had with my mooncup. The stem was difficult to clean and always got dried blood stuck in it. If you get a cup which is flexible its also possible to stretch out the holes by pushing from one side which makes them easier to clean too. I dont find that using lots of cleaning products on it is the important part. Its making sure that youve removed all trace of old blood.,menstrualcups,dbo16vh,2,t5_2st5x

11438508,0,t1_dfsiy91,Okay so generally the edge that I punch down gets stuck down so what I do is I try to massage the spine in an upwards direction while pushing on it kind of to try to encourage it to pop open if that makes any sense. Sometimes I cant get it to pop open so then I take it out try to do the punch down less extreme so punching down less of the cup so its kind of lightly folded and reinsert. Ive never experienced having the cup feel like its vacuum sealed so this might not be the right advice for you.,menstrualcups,dfsjlgc,1,t5_2st5x
11511832,0,t3_649oc8,It will still leak if its full just because of how my cervix is. But at least I can empty it in a public bathroom without creating a mess. It helps me last a few more hours than using the Lena,menstrualcups,dg0v988,1,t5_2st5x
11528270,0,t3_64amc4,Id always known that I had a light period but I became aware of just how light it was when I started using cups.
