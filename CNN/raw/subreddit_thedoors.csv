1690713,0,t1_cjs9814,Oh so theres those kinds of rumors? That kind of makes sense what Ray said. Im going to the library tomorrow I really want to read up on the Doors. Jim was a very interesting person. And that hair flip is just fabulously fierce!Edit thanks for answering!!,thedoors,cjsa17r,5,t5_2svnm

6457223,0,t3_4436ic,Sounds really great but...vocals on covers always draw comparison to Morrison and if it doesnt sound like Morrison it pales.The vocals sound good dont get me wrong but theyre not Morrison and thats what sounds best. Its the vocals that holds the history that captured the imagination.  I would keep the background music and weave in the vocals of Morrison.,thedoors,czn7xl1,1,t5_2svnm

9060006,0,t3_54ay34,Maybe its some strange personal bias that Im unaware of but it is weird for me to hear the Doors talking about winter. So much of their persona was all built around the sunshine and summers that this song always stood out to me as strange. Not to say its bad I love it as much as any other Doors song save a select few but to this day its . . . odd. Anyone else have the same thought?,thedoors,d80v891,2,t5_2svnm

11003839,0,t1_ddw8eb7,I just watched that somewhat recent documentary on the Doors that Johnny Depp narrated and his closing words as The Crystal Ship played in the background really resonated..... Some thought Jim a poet whose soul was trapped between heaven and hell while others thought he was just another rock star who crashed and burned....but this much is true you cant burnout if youre not on fire. Pretty powerful and on the money about Morrison.,thedoors,def955r,2,t5_2svnm
