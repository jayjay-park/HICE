70007,0,t3_1uug1i,aw man thats such a bummer  I would contact their customer support team and see if theyll do anything with a proof of purchase Im sure theyll help you out! they seem like a great company to work with. something similar happened to a WKD piece of mine and they were so great about it!,LingerieAddiction,cemedq8,1,t5_2w3h8
653470,0,t1_cgeienr,Oh!! Also stockings..... I could get a plain black stocking like the kind of thigh highs I like and itll look similar but not constrict? ,LingerieAddiction,cgejs8g,2,t5_2w3h8

1243911,0,t3_28amdk,Do you just mean a gstring style like this possibly NSFWIf so Victorias Secret sells a pair though in colors are not all great that they call a vstring. I looked up the vstring style on their site and some of them are yshaped at back but some have small triangles of fabric or lace connecting bands. The pair I linked are ones I personally own so I can confirm that the back is just a y created by the three straps coming together.,LingerieAddiction,ci9k0o3,1,t5_2w3h8
1522096,0,t1_cj70xql,I want to try the extraordinarily longer thigh highs sockdreams makes. Im  and I have thunder thighs. I hate when thigh highs turn into abovetheknees. The only options I can find still on the market are Kriss Soonik unfortunately. Theyre pricy and shes got a pretty small size range. Let me know if you do find something please? Ive been lusting after the Kriss Soonik ones but I dont want to have to splurge on it. ,LingerieAddiction,cj72lr0,2,t5_2w3h8

8343913,0,t3_4tug65,From what I know AP times their sales worldwide. They used to run on a summerwinter sale rotation but may be moving to a springautumn rotation. The last sale just ended so I expect the next one to hit late October or November. ,LingerieAddiction,d5kjkcz,2,t5_2w3h8
8733601,0,t3_4zlg6w,I would be very interested and have signed up for the updates ect. I do agree with the other commenters that the site is very bare. Some of the info i feel is missing are where it ships too extra shipping costs I dont want to pay  and then  shipping on top of that for example how customizable incuding colour and type of product how many products would be in the box and the quality of the products high end low end midrange ect,LingerieAddiction,d6xch9r,2,t5_2w3h8
