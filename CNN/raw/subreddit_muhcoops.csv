5512858,0,t1_cwg9q2f,gtYou dont understand what a wage is if thats how you define it. Also I think youre in the wrong sub. I dont define it that way. Your the one who brought up wage labour in reference to mutualism not adhering to socialism and being selfexploitation. What definition of wage labour are you using that includes wagelabour in mutualism but not in the case of peasants selling there produce?gtAnd you dont understand how Feudalism worked either. I used landlord and rent to not engage in Eurocentric history. However rent is an accurate description of the various feudal taxes levied in western Europe during feudalisms existence.gtI never said they were sufficient I said they were components. Youre just arguing for arguing sake. So you agree that noncapitalist forms exchange and markets exist?,muhcoops,cwgbg6m,0,t5_3ahcn
