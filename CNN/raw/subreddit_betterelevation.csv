3147063,0,t1_convy9k,Thanks for the kind words. Writing is the part that takes the longest  usually three to four weeks for the script to come together. Filming only takes an hour or two and editingvideo production takes a few days. Most of the video production time is me borrowing images from Wikipedia or buying stock photos then meticulously placing them in Final Cut. me for now. Maybe someday Ill hire someone to go searching for stock photos for me. But I do have friends and colleagues read through the scripts before I shoot anything.,betterelevation,coo6u9h,3,t5_36tzc
