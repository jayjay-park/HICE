6777096,0,t1_d0k60ju,Really? My box says cherry but theyre definitely oxblood. Ive seen the really shiny ones that are definitely more red which Id call cherry.Edit I just looked it up and apparently the originals are considered oxblood but the cheaper ones which I have...and regret cheaping out on are considered cherry red even though they are the same colour. ,Skinhead,d0kguc6,1,t5_2snrm

7349138,0,t1_d2dgt87,About  years and I live in england  and I have a few skinhead mates but skinheads are increasingly uncommon around my parts in northern England.This is why it is important to carry on the traditional style because if you start to accept more unconventional styles into it it will become diluted.Yes subcultures may evolve but its not always for the best this is why some people in my country are going back to the late sixties style because it was far smarter than than the eighties style of high boots and skinny jeans which looks more punk than it does skinhead.And skinhead is related to mod this is a fact. They listened to the same music at first some even called themselves mods in fact some were mods before they were skinheads.Again the  point is irrelevant if you want to dress modern dont be a skinhead because it is an old fashioned style.,Skinhead,d2djouk,1,t5_2snrm

8624871,0,t3_4xdk7f,Another vote for Templars as the definitive best. Theyre top of the class. My favorites as of late go to Vanity Concrete amp Broadsiderskeeping traditional Oi elements intact but doing clutch things for the future.,Skinhead,d6jpm90,3,t5_2snrm
10544985,0,t3_5qz1p6,Im  and prefer  sits on top of my boot and I dont care for cuffs. Consider learning to sew small machines are usually found cheap used and will really payoff in minor adjustments and hemming in the long run. Im not particularly affluent so I snag nice levis at say ross or marshalls in my waist size and hem if need be. Levi  shrink to fit are the standard but most any slim strait leg jean will do. ,Skinhead,dd3e3z8,1,t5_2snrm
10697524,0,t1_ddj8fgv,Ahh thanks i was wondering who it was as ive heard a couple of different bands doing this and wasnt quite sure. Yeh i love romper stomper  brilliant movie I think your right about master race as he says it at the very beginning first thing he says . I have been puzzled who this was for a while as ive also seen it on youtube a while back incorrectly labelled as cock sparrer doing it when it was this exact version  really good song though. Hey thanks for clearing that lil mystery up for me ,Skinhead,ddjdbys,1,t5_2snrm
