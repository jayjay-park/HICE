I feel like the killer obviously has something planned for the bodies and I cant wait to see what it is it isnt like a killer to remove the bodies and clean up they are usually just left there. I know it will only be the th episode but apparently the death count is higher this season so they need to start killing people off like they have unlimited characters.

8206188,0,t1_d53a5v3,Gonna number this just to keep track of the points. I thought the killer this season was the accomplice to Piper are we supposed to think that the accomplice to Piper who audrey was the accomplice to has an accomplice. So a total of  killers not including Audrey? They definitely cared about Jake. I dont know where the idea that no one cared about him other than Brooke came from. Good point about Mrs. Lang. As for the Sheriff my theory is his son did something bad and the sheriff took up the mantle of the killer to cover for his son and is in way to deep.  I dont think Troy James has the potential to be the killer at all by this point. We are pretty far into the season now and Troy James hasnt been introduced by anything other than name. Not in person once. It has to be someone we are already invested in from the beginning of the season. Just like Piper came in around episode  or  and we got invested in her.

8372545,0,t1_d5nz0fh,He could have stolen her phone to get evidence to try to convince someone later that Audrey is a villain which seems to be the Killers motivation this year.  We dont know how that will come into play yet.  I figured the whole point of him guessing her password is that he then has a genuine expression of excitement when he gets into her phone... and that is what we see on his face.  When he sees the memes it could be an extension of him being glad he has access to the files he sent.  When he reads the texts from the killer he actually seems more smug and ambivalent than shocked  they did the same thing with Jill in Scream  where theres a shot of her hiding under the bed from Ghostface but people paused the trailer and noticed although she was hiding her expression wasnt fear but ambivalence which could be interpreted a number of ways.There are a lot of reasons I suspect Noah mainly because in the very first scene Audrey asks if he texted her and he said no which I thought would be sold as ironic in retrospect... and also because he told Audrey about the storage unit and the Killer left a message for her in there and no one else could have led her there... then the Killer repeats something she said to Noah in private so we think its because hes listening in but it could be that the person she just said it to is the one who is texting her etc.  Noahs storylines are constantly sold as nonsuspicious  losing his virginity buying condoms  so we just rule him off even though theres nothing that keeps him from running around in scenes where we dont know his whereabouts.  There was also the idea that Noah would escort Kieran and two girls agreed to go  the girls are caught immediately and Noah is separated from Kieran meaning theres a long period of time where hes unaccounted for but it was done in such a subtle way the viewer doesnt even realize it.  I dont know if Im right but if you watch the show as if Noah is the killer all of the scenes that convince the casual viewer to write him off still can check out.But all this aside I am sure Audrey doesnt know who is messaging her.  She would have called him or her by their name by now if she did.,MTVScream,d5o49h3,2,t5_33wwq
8382296,0,t1_d5pb2lq,.Kieran  Hes the only one who doesnt have a legitimate alibi for all of the major attacks so far this season including Mrs. Lang Branson Eddie and Jake. He has a motive in the form of blaming them for his fathers death and feeling betrayed by everyone around him particularly Emma. When it comes to his suspicious behavior he has yet to reach red herring level of creepybitchy like Stavo Eli or Haley. Lastly it would fall in line with the Billy Loomis reveal in Scream  and this seasons tagline of Trust Nothing..Zoe  My personal theory is that shes the real accomplice from Season  so thats why she got weird when Noah asked what she was doing.I think that she sent the audio clip to both Emma AND Kieran with the former happening because Audrey broke her promise about not telling anyone and the latter being because shes working with him but neither of them expected her to poke a hole in their plan by telling someone what really happened.As for a motive I think shes Audrey . in terms of her loneliness problem but with more murder..I dont really have a third one. I just think that its Kieran and Zoe working together. Some of the other characters may be slightly suspicious but not psychopathic murderer levels of suspicious.,MTVScream,d5pc2un,3,t5_33wwq

I dont believe it could be Eli because it is just way too obvious. Kieran finding those letters or maybe even planting them? would be a good move to incriminate Eli. BUT as someone else said what is Kierans motive? That being said most of the others have been eliminated because the Killer has either contacted attacked or killed them...I dont remember Kieran being contacted...he was kidnapped at the carnival though but that could have been staged.

She has issues and I may be a part of a minority here but Id like this theory of they could make it work.   The main target started out being Audrey and since she brought piper to Lakewood that would be Emmas traumatized justification of a motive. That doesnt exactly work with the theory of this seasons killer being pipers accomplice last season but I really think Audrey was deeper than she admits. She was about to bash Noahs head in when she thought he was going to stumble on her secrets.  Who knows though???

8666200,0,t3_4yjaoc,I was definitely disappointed with the finale as well because I was really hoping that they wouldnt cop out with Kieran. But I do think Kieran saying you will be safe again was very telling maybe thats because were viewers? idk because the seond he said it I knew he was done. I do think it was realistic for Emma to catch onto that because what are the odds of the psycho calling you saying something and then your boyfriend repeating that same thing? Sure maybe if he said it like... a few weeks later or something itd be whatever but this was literally a few minutes after shed gotten the phone call and Eli had just been trying to say that Kieran was the killer.Eli being at Wills funeral was so dumb though they could have implicated him in so many other ways but the writers chose to go with that?! Im really disappointed they killed him too. Does that mean we wont get to know what he and Tina were up to? Or anything else? So pointless. ,MTVScream,d6ow7a9,1,t5_33wwq

8685173,0,t3_4yrij0,I think it lacked something to be honest  but so did Season . I think I wanted more of a typical slasher set up less drawn out maybe? Both seasons have a lack chase scenes which is disappointing because theyre so good to watch but significantly more in season . Id have loved to see the killer try to attack more people this season and actually do it in typical slasher style Scream stabbings? rather than the complicated gory set ups although they were good to watch. Another huge thing I noticed was that they werent killing any crucial characters this season apart from Jake and Branson if you want to count him. Most of the characters died although they were good and interesting were dispensable and predictable  why did the killer never go for Maggie or Brooke etc? Also I think they couldve revealed the killer a little better  maybe thrown in a chase scene with the killer trying to attack Emma etc  it all seemed a little rushed and weak compared to the way the killer usually navigates himself and how dramatic the build up was. Still just my opinion  Im being harsh on purpose. The show as a whole was good and I was never exactly disappointed by any episodes directly. I looked forward to them each week and I really hope we get a season  because even if the plot is a little questionable sometimes the characters are so well written and acted. I adore them all and I cant wait for the Halloween special. ,MTVScream,d6r9tyn,5,t5_33wwq

8700124,0,t3_4z4yiw,I think the difference is Kieran admitted his faults Emma got the answers she was looking for. With Audrey it was always it wasnt my fault. Also I would not say they were in the same situation. Audrey lured Piper to lakewood which when Emma learned upset her and made her mad. It was a fallout between two friends. With Kierans reveal there was no going back. Emma was not going to forgive Kieran no matter what he said and it was a lost cause. I think her anger towards Audrey was somewhat motivated as friends and she knew shed eventually forgive her. With Kieran there was no forgiveness or amends. Kieran was not going to say sorry or see the light. It was a lost cause on Emmas part to hold a grudge or guilt trip Kieran.  ,MTVScream,d6t5biq,2,t5_33wwq
