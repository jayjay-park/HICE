9222892,0,t1_d8l13bq,Im just asking a valid question. The developers temporarily removed one of the Dissemblers because of this AND people pay realworld money for ingame items which is unfair when others destroy them.But thanks for you opinion.

9754584,0,t1_dadapyl,Is there anyway to report players at all? I understand sometimes people make mistakes but Ive been playing in a town all day and there are two people who keep purposely eating all of the apples from autoload smashing every doll in or outside of town throwing away materials. They are cheering each other on while the rest of the town is snubbing them. Theyve been jailed several times but it seems completely pointless. Can any action be taken against them with video proof?,TomorrowChildrenPS4,dafgyro,1,t5_3c242

9900738,0,t3_5h78qr,Itd have been fine if the regular comrade tools remained available but the special ones were on a timer.   In my town we had no access to any of the comrade tools no pick shovel nor saw...this is not good.  Not sure what to make of the new praisesnubbing system seems like its not a bad idea but you can easily burn through praises quickly then feel bad for not being able to register a praise on someone whos praising you.   The idea of having to toil to earn the privilege isnt a bad one though just perhaps needs some work.Still needing Dolls reduced in toil value its way too much earning  toil for one doll and thousands at the Ministry for people who do nothing but jetpack around islands picking them up and little else.   Im currently no. in my town for toil the guy in nd was first for a long time but Ive recently caught him just doing exactly this flying around cleaning up all the dolls just to get the toil points.I dont really care about the top spot I just got there because Im on a lot and work like a beaver when I am on and I mean work properly I mine and cut everything I come across and pick up dolls when theyre there.  Its frustrating and spoiling the game though hell only gather a resource once hes got his hands on as many dolls as possible like earlier today we have  wood in storage and I see him at an island with lots of trees but only dolls upon dolls stacked in the loading area.   And really when people do this its selfish are others not supposed to get that points boost?  He seriously does this a lot twice caught him storing piles of dolls in a little hole he made for himself.   The only way to negate this is to reduce toil on dolls at the very least definitely at the ministry.  Im working my backside off back and forth with resources and our hero is stacking thousands more in toil points just cleansing islands of dolls...really winds me up.  lol,TomorrowChildrenPS4,day37ws,9,t5_3c242

9908216,0,t3_5h6z0x,Sigh.  Played the game quite heavily the past few weeks even was starting to get folks to join or at least tryin to.  Got my first side city restored as my first one was swarmed with trolls two days in.  Loaded it up today to see it is flooded with citizen incubators and I cant even plant a tree.   people all repairing stuff like good towns folk and I cant plant apartments down because I have to wait nearly six hours to buy a disassembler.Again sigh.,TomorrowChildrenPS4,daz2bg7,1,t5_3c242
10463028,0,t3_5otpsf,I love the brand new towns. They are the best to start out in in my opinion. You get to work from scratch and really get to figure out how this game works. New towns have less people usually which can be both good and bad. Less people is good because you can explore more with ease and there is no opportunity to participate in a race for resources and dolls. Fewer people also means that it can be difficult and even devastating if the town suffers too much damage. New towns are my fav because I feel like its more fun to rise them up to restoration.,TomorrowChildrenPS4,dcu39zp,2,t5_3c242

10753475,0,t1_ddolg8b,Well said this is the most stressful part of the events for me. I would feel way more relaxed just going about as usual if I could keep track on the way. Killing all the Izverg on the islands and stuff would be more practical to complete the event if you could keep track there would probably be less people shooting from the turrets all the time and changing the flow of towns. I gave up trying to complete this event. If I get it awesome. If not oh well. ,TomorrowChildrenPS4,ddp50mq,5,t5_3c242
