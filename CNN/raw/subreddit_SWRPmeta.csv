8901948,0,t3_4ur788,Alright I was wanting to join the rp but need help making a character. Ive done some roleplays before so this wont be too long but hopefully i can make the character work out.Alright so I was wanting to make a jedi or gray jedi who mainly focuses on seeking enlightenment and using the force to great heights living mostly pacifistic. So I was mainly wondering what class would i go under and what would be a good way to try and make a name? Is there a generator i dont know about or is there more to it?,SWRPmeta,d7hvwzz,1,t5_3fmly
