625991,0,t3_21884j,hug Only thing I know how to address is the porn and your mindset about women.The women he is going out withhe probably manipulated at the very least.They may have come from homes like yours and were simply drawn to what they were used toor had low self esteem and didnt think they deserved better and he treated them like he treated you.I have a mom who keeps going to abusive and manipulative menthe one shes with now doesnt seem so bad on the surface but is pretty manipulative.She grew up in an abusive narcissist family and she doesnt know or understand much different despite trying to teach her.Ive been around many other women who end up with abusers and there are a lot of reasons why they are drawn to them or end up sticking around.It really did feel like a rape of my soul. Like I couldnt escape until he was done with me he may have pushed me back down again more than once. With no support system I couldnt cope.This is something that often happens to women in abusive situations....they may want to leavebut feel that they cant.Women are just human beings like you.Wanting to punish them is like wanting to punish yourself..and is that what part of this is about?Are you angry with yourself for not being able to make it different and be in control?Maybe you need to forgive yourself for that before you can see certain women that have unhealthy actions in a different light.Couple of questions I want you to ask yourself..is it true power to hurt someone?Really?It takes much more power to control yourself than to control someone else.To build up instead of tear down.I think you can turn that wanting to be in control its a pretty normal reaction for what you went throughcan relate in a wayinto something good.Knowing that even if people treat you badly you still choose to develop good character and work on being the best person you can be can help with your confidence.Also theres much to be said for having the power to make someones life bettermake someone happygive them pleasure.,LifeAfterNarcissism,cgbfcjd,5,t5_30biu

Does your therapist seem very empathetic do you feel a good relationship with himher or is it more of a colder you just need to do X Y and Z directive objective kind of relationship?  I really learned a lot of positive things not by being told but by being treated positively by working with my therapist.  My  big core issues were emotional deprivation and social isolation from schema therapy book Reinventing Your Life.  You said you believe people will hurt you eventually.  Have you experienced this much in the past?  Do you have a count of how many?  For me I believe those painful relationship endings were necessary seeing how I could experience the pain and each time actually come back stronger you have to purposefully see your own pain while also seeing their right and the randomness of the situation...it truly is a blending of CBT and just watching your emotions mindfully.

If hes not your boyfriend or your friend then you have no obligations to him. It also doesnt matter that you contacted him in the past when you were in a tough spot. Now is different because you are different. Now you have a better idea about what you want and what is healthy. Things change your life changed. Hes part of your past and hes obsolete. Your silence is the way out of the weird place he put you in. He knows how to push your buttons somewhat and he knows youre a caring person thats why you feel guilty. Its just temporary and it will fade with time. With him youre allowed to be a brick wall and a broken record. If you see him on the street ignore him and walk right by.

2669064,0,t3_2osduj, years ago I moved from the UK to the US. At the time I felt like I was escaping but in reality I wasnt I was moving from one N to another. I am back in the UK now and taking steps to move on from being a victim of Narcissism.I still however believe that move was the best thing I could have done at the time. Okay it didnt work out as planned but that was because I wasnt as far along with my healing as you were. I WAS running away. You arent.A few words of support for you. Homesickness is normal and natural. As is feelings of guilt and uncertainty. You have been conditioned to feel like their needs are more important than yours. Dont waste the opportunities you have dwelling on them. You deserve to be happy and you deserve to experience new things. You arent a slave to other peoples feelings. You have a right to listen to your own and take steps to live your life on your terms. Listen to the alanis morissette song Unprodigal Daughter  I listened to it on repeat throughout a  hour flight. There is so much in that song that resonates and to me even now I find it a really empowering song that almost makes me want to literally drop everything and fly off into the sunset to create a new life. The build up to that and the prospect of starting again as my real true authentic me felt intoxicating at the time. That song really helped me and I hope it does you too.A part of me feels envious of you. Id give anything to be something again and back on that plane. Id just change the destination have planned and saved more and wouldnt be moving to be with someone else. Its a huge step to make for your own sanity and you should feel very proud that you are doing it the right way. xx,LifeAfterNarcissism,cn6yy9e,2,t5_30biu

And eventually through much reflection and therapy I decided that I deserve good people in my life.  So naturally people who are were not good I removed from my life.   for me this is just an explanation in a way that others can understand.  If I want to share with them the details I will let them know that they are difficult.  But for the most part I do not withhold the facts of my life.  So I guess the way I would answer your question is whenever it comes up in conversation.  I would not choose a time to tell them  I would just be forward about it from the beginning of the relationship.

Shame is the feeling that youre bad worthless everyone hates you youre alone flawed unlovable etc. Its a feeling that ultimately exists to protect you probably from the pain your narcissist parent inflicted by being overly critical.

3853380,0,t1_cqvhzvq,I created a filter called stresstrigger.  Messages from nrelatives and flying monkeys go there.  When I am feeling up to it Ill root through and take a look.  I have it set so I dont even see the folder unless Im looking for it  other folders get promoted to top visibility when they receive messages.  This is a gmail feature.This way I dont react PTSD style just knowing theres a message triggering the everpresent freefloating anxiety and dread so common in PTSD sufferers. I wouldnt have even read the message and Id already experience a physical nausea sensation just knowing that it was there.  That shit had to stop.Over time I stopped having the kneejerk reaction and sometimes Ill even check it just to see what things are there to irritate.  Youd be surprised how detached you can be to messages that are  months old.  If they require response Ill do that but on MY schedule not theirs.  Its great to get invites to parties that I would never in a million years want to attend but since the date was  months previous its already done and over with.  If I  dont RSVP whatever.  Events of major importance e.g. weddings and birthdays where spendy catering is involved use the mail with RSVP cards.  An email invite to an opportunity to be berated by nrelatives is best left unopened for several months.If its a REAL emergency actual responsible people know how to reach me and it wont be through email.  I also have my phone setup to filter.  My nmom cant so much as ring my phone  she doesnt have that right.  She can leave a message.  Itll be several days before Ill get back to her perhaps even weeks if it warrants a return call.  Again Im not at her beck and call anymore.  She doesnt get to command me like a minion.  By the time I get back her attentionseeking episode has usually resolved itself by some other means so shes not even that interested in talking to me. After all she doesnt need me anymore and I am increasingly unreliable.This is how Ive had to wean my nmom off me as a source of nsupply. Its taken me years but as she gets older its harder for her to make the effort to seek supply given how many barriers I throw up.,LifeAfterNarcissism,cqvir9p,5,t5_30biu

I was prescribed a situational anxiety med and I always wait until right before bed to use it on days when I need it  it pushes the anxiety down long enough for me to get one decent night of sleep and sometimes I get three or four good days out of that. I like that I can maximize the effect this way but Ive been feeling kinda stupid that I apparently need so much help with sleep. I can get to sleep okay Im not waking up at  am panicking like I was for a while the nightmares are much less frequent and I usually sleep  hours  everything sounds like it should be fine only I never feel rested and Im fatigued pretty much all the time.

4235580,0,t3_39f3cf,I relate to this youre not alone. The intensity of the emotional waves weakens a bit as you learn to accept them  I think because the fear of having emotions dissipates. As far as living with it all the time Ive found if I look at my ability to be stoic as a tool it helps a lot. There are times when you cant be emotional  like when youre driving or in a meeting at work  its great to feel like I have this super power to analyze things logically and cut through and bull when I need it. At other times I tell myself I dont need to use that tool now and it helps me to let it go. Oddly physical exercise helps a lot with shedding that mask when I find it hard to remove particularly yoga  I totally bawl my eyes out sometimes in yoga class. ,LifeAfterNarcissism,cs31mzg,3,t5_30biu

4444413,0,t1_csda138,Just thought I would update you ... i did send a message to my father on fathers day and all I got back was a formal message stating that I refused to comply to his wishes to meet and to discuss the situation once and for all. I have no intention of meeting to discuss the same issues over and over again as we have been going around in circles for years now i refuse to discuss how many of the things he has said and done have hurt me and i refuse to sit down and be told how my attitude sucks and how wrong i am about the way i think how disrespectful rude and selfish my husband is etc etc etc. Few days later was my mums birthday so i sent a card and a text message wishing her a happy birthday. What i got back was the most VILE reply filled with insults on how I am heartless insane and a hypocrite. This was the last nail in the proverbial coffin for me as it was all i needed to see that my mother who i always felt sorry for as i thought she was under my fathers control is in actual fact as bad as him. no mother should speak to her child in this way she even went as far as saying that since i refused to go to their house to discuss the issues then i deserved to be disowned She said that was their last offer and that unless i went there then that was it. I feel as though someone has died does this make sense? i feel this horrible empty feeling inside and the realisation that my parents dont love me the way a parent should love their child ... does this feeling ever go?

Without expecting anything in return.But the Nparent doesnt want the child to know that. The Nparent wants the child to have a job of ego stroking and entertaining the Nparent from day one.

5033198,0,t1_cusidf1,Russel Barkley the leading researcher on ADHD in America says that laziness is a social construct that doesnt exist. Motivation is feeling good while doing things that improve your life.  Thats based on the Dopamine ltgt Noradrenaline balance in the thinking and the emotional part of the brain. If you have too little of either of those neurotransmitters  theory your primal brain takes over and does everything to get out of this unpleasant state eat all the chocolate smoke all the cigarettes watch all the movies. Barkley describes it as a disconnection between knowing and doing you may know everything but you will do nothing. So you think you are lazy when in fact your brain is not working properly and you could not possibly sustain attention for how long you need it.Dr Gabor Mat son of a Jewish mother born in  in Eastern Europe says that ADHD develops when a sensitive child does not get the pleasant eye to eye interaction with its parents for whatever reason. Humans have to be born when the brain isnt fully developed because otherwise babies would not fit through the pelvis. So the first  years are very important in forming the brain and its functions.In his case his father was deported and the mother was deeply sad and troubled. One day she had to call the doctor because Gabor would not stop crying. The doctor said that he would come but that all Jewish babies are crying.Gabor said children think that everything is about them. So when the mother is sad the child thinks she is sad because of it. So people with ADD get stuck in the feeling that the world doesnt want them. And if the world does not want me Ill make damn sure that it needs me.He now treats addicts who have been abused all their lives in Canada. He learned of his ADD when he was  or  and nowadays hes writing books like a god.My Nparents are doctors I have ADD. I had no motivation. Now I write this.Theres two ways to do things when you have no motivation Not at all hes lazy! yes but hes fineish emotionally or motivated by a strong emotion. that would mean youd have to think yourself into anxietyragelove to be stimulated enough to get things done. goodbye living in reality.Russel BarkleyGabor Mat,LifeAfterNarcissism,cusowpn,2,t5_30biu

5324646,0,t3_3nxbmz,This is so heartbreaking to read. God this is so close to home. gtIm afraid that they will hurt me or hurt themselves. This was a common thing when I was growing up and completely accepted by my parents as a natural reaction to rejection.This is the perfect example of how ACoNs arent ever ever ever allowed to say No or have emotions feelings and instincts of their own.No is a complete sentence. And anyone who doesnt take your no for an answer is unhealthy and unwell in the head. And thats not your responsibility.If you tell someone you dont want to talk tomarryspend time with them and they hurt themselves thats their problem.If you tell someone no and they dont respect that and try to hurt you or keep bothering you and threaten to hurt you  Call The Police. If you know that you are protected and you know you have a right to say no then it might become a lot easier for you to say no. I know i have no problem rejecting people anymore. I get it that its not my responsibility to tell people what they want to hear anymore. That made things a lot easier.  And the people who didnt respect my no and turned out to be dangerous? Well they were dealt with in the appropriate way  and I feel totally safe now.   Like it or not there are many kind of people who prey on those of us with unstable upbringings and skewed sense of self esteem Like it or not people seek out people they can manipulate and exploit.The only way out of this is through. Say no. Maybe have a prepared statement like Kirelies said and just say it once. Dont engage in a further discussion on the matter. If the persons behaviour becomes threatening or you feel unsafe thats harassment. You dont owe anyone an explanation about why you dont want to start a relationship with them. And if someones behaviour becomes so badthreateninginappropriate that you have to end a relationship you dont own them an explanation about that either.I think Im right in saying us ACoNs have had our fair share of unhealthy relationships that are modeled on our parental figures.  Its not uncommon but it doesnt have to be that way. We can and do break the cycle. TLDR anyone who doesnt accept that you arent attracted to them and tries to hurt or bully you about it  is basically proving how unattractive they really are. ,LifeAfterNarcissism,cvsaa4u,9,t5_30biu

5352552,0,t3_3ob80n,You sound like you have a good head on your shoulders. You have realized some stuff that took many of us long into our adult lives to realize about our parents. Im not quite twice your age but I only just realized some similar stuff about my dad. Hopefully your dad will be able to turn it around but its not a reflection of you if he doesnt. Always remember that. I really think you should stick college out for a while. Life is x easier with that barrier crossed. It sounds like you are in a good financial situation possibly because of your parents but with no or low contact they may decide to take it away to manipulate you. Its important you learn a way to support yourself. If that isnt the case with your money I apologize for assuming. Further though I really believe college is an irreplaceable experience for young people who are lucky enough to have the money and opportunity to attend. Remember that not everyone does so value it. One of the ways I made friends after I felt so alienated my freshman year was to join something. For me it was a club sports team. I found one where I met men and women and formed some of my closest friendships. I even met my husband through it. Joining a club or something really helps. But I also like uzazzafrazzy s advice. I might even take it myself adult friendships are tough to initiate sometimes too. Hang in there. Travel over the summers andor apply for a semester abroad program.

5377128,0,t3_3okzqa,This could be me writing this post. I feel this way too. I am grieving it sounds like you are too. My childhood the parents I never had the abusers I had instead.  I am grieving all these things.  I am grieving the reality I thought I had had but didnt the parents I invented in my head to keep me alive through childhood the false beliefs I clung to and the denial I lived in for so long all to hold on to this sad dream that my parents were good parents that they loved me that they were my heroes and idols that they would accept me one day trying to convince myself that they showed affection that they withheld that they had justified reasons to mistreat me that they didnt that they did truly love me and they just made mistakes as all humans do that I was to blame not my heroes that I was a horrible daughter and a bad human for not loving them back when they were so wonderful that I was a failure for not being good enough to deserve their love that I had failed them by not being the daughter they felt that they were entitled to be given the years of hating myself so that I would not have to hate them the years of telling myself that this was all my fault therefore I had control and if only if only if only I could be good enough then they would love me finally.  God the lies. All those fucking lies all of that denial. All so I could keep a false idea alive in my head. What I gained from those lies was the ability to avoid this grief that I am in now.  This not wanting to get out of bed not having money but not wanting a job no motivation crying all the time reading books that only make it worse because it makes so much horrifying sense now dammit this is the grief that I got to avoid by clinging to my lies.  I got to avoid this grief and hell thats something as this is awful.But what I lost is so much more. By clinging to that denial I lost my way I lost my goals I lost my values I lost myself. I lost who I was. I did not know.  I had to settle for hating myself so I wouldnt hate them. I had to take on the blame so I could keep hope alive.  If I was to blame because I wasnt good enough I could maybe become good enough and win their approval.  A lack of love and affection and approval in childhood from parents only makes children more desperate for it as time goes on.  And I was desperate.  I sacrificed who I was and what I wanted out of my life to try to be the daughter they felt they had deserved all along. I tried to medicate away my defective personality with drugs.  I started a path towards a career I never wanted but that my abusers would respect.  I gave up on my own goals. I lost my own values as a result. I sacrificed every other relationship in my life because rage does not dissipate or evaporate it simply transfers. So transfer that rage I did to friends and significant others and coworkers and extended family. I lost honesty authenticity compassion motivation drive integrity and my compass in general trying so hard to win over people who were never on my side but against mine from the beginning.I avoided this grief for a long time and for good reason.  But I lost so much more.  The only way over it is through it.  Your hopelessness stems from the past.  You had a hopeless past.  Remember that. Your future is unknown and is far from hopeless. You are giving up hope for the one thing most of us badly wanted for so long love and acceptance from our abusers. This is where the hopelessness stems from.  You have to grieve the old denying beliefs before you can find your new beliefs.  You have to let go of that old and hopeless life and grieve its death before you can begin anew with a newfound sense of self you have probably never experienced before. This is one ending so you can start a real beginning. ,LifeAfterNarcissism,cvyzm0r,1,t5_30biu

For preventative medication I found gabapentin works. It helps improve my sleep which then helps with the migraines. Nortriptyline seems to work for people but it makes my life hell. It gives me insomnia and I am just a zombie every day. Aside from medication and moving away from Nmom keeping a regular sleep schedule really helped. I always go to bed and wake up at the same time everyday including weekends. Keep tabs on when you get migraine attacks and see if you recognize any patterns or triggers.

6557646,0,t3_45ex94,It really depends on the person. I have many friends and people I just meet that are very good about it and listen to me. There are other people who I have talked about it with who completely dismiss me and dont understand how I could never talk to my Ns ever again.If the conversation leads there though I wouldnt hide it. You did nothing wrong in being abused as a kid. Even though I do sometimes because I dont like to deal with other peoples opinions. There I go again back and forth. I guess every situation is different.I used to be super open and trusting of everyone but as I grow older and heal I have become more closed to people. Mostly because of the people who have told me Im a terrible person and then used the Bible out of context to back up their claims.Sorry this really didnt get anywhere. To sum it up it depends on the situation for me. But if you are able to defend yourself and deal with people who will invalidate you then I think it is rewarding to expose the horrible things our Ns have done to us.,LifeAfterNarcissism,czxm4x6,4,t5_30biu
6574076,0,t3_45m31c,Considering that narcissists have many of the traits that children from about  to  years old have of selfishness and exploring all the options for attaining selfish goals without regard or consideration of others including throwing tantrums to get what they want I think that they come about from parents no matter what type of personality narcissists or not who are inattentive do not encourage the children to think of others and who give in to their childs selfish influences rewarding that type of behavior.  The influences can be tantrums annoying the parents burdening them any types of manipulations from lying to storytelling to acting cute sad angry etc..  This can happen when good people parent poorly just as much as when bad people parent poorly.  For example if good people parent poorly because theyre in an extremely stressful exhaustive job and life situation and therefore havent the patience to parent responsibly attentively in a nurturing way and properly their children will wind up experiencing positive reinforcement of manipulative tactics like lying and tantrums during the stages that they are most likely to explore those social interaction options.  And without parental or other insight teaching them to empathize and pointing out the values in doing so and the golden rule those children are much more likely to grow up to have narcissistic personality disorder and continue those behaviors.  These are just my own thoughts and observations.Children of narcissistic parents may grow up unaware that their behaviors are inappropriate and irresponsible.  People who as children were treated as the golden child may also experience being recruited to support these behaviors and being rewarded for them so might not recognize them as inappropriate and irresponsible and even destructive and against their own wellbeing.  Scapegoats I think would be more likely to recognize these traits but might not be able to articulate and understand them and be riddled with confusion.  They dont just lack guidance they are actively under disinformation campaigns gaslighting for example as well as berated insulted falsely shamed etc..  Thankfully places like rraisedbynarcissists and this subreddit rLifeAfterNarcissism exist to help with recognition and various other resources exist as well.  I hope we can put together resources for better understanding and dealing with and advancing from a life of being around this negative destructive behavior and the inaccurate ideas promoted taught and reinforced by it.  ,LifeAfterNarcissism,czzbbbs,2,t5_30biu

7056747,0,t1_d1g7euk,Again it was not my intention to take a dig at the mods hence the apology. As for Buddhist methods I am not an expert but have used the principles to great benefit for myself. I am not sure exactly what you mean by not emphasis the self but from what I have learned so far is that we become obsessed with certain aspects of life that are unhealthy to us and the people around us  such as repetitive negative thought processes clinging to impermanent material things and being mindful of our intentions and actions  and that practices like meditation help us identify those unhealthy elements that we obsess over so we can stop. This will create a vacuum that we can fill with more positive things that we discover. You dont have to be an aesthetic and remove yourself from the material world just dont let it consume you i.e. it is good to eat your vegetables as part of a regular diet but you can still enjoy chocolate. Also external stimulus and life events do not need to destroy you like abuse only your thoughts can do that. If you can identify your tendencies to cling to these impulses and other things that are impermanent if you can develop the ability to choose your thoughts every day. You can then you can use that ability to help yourself and your loved ones live a happier life.    I believe that was my motive with my most recent posts. ,LifeAfterNarcissism,d1g8paw,1,t5_30biu

ASK  for their help as a team setting some chain of command boundaries and setting task completion expectations.  Then ask them what they need from you and LISTEN. Repeat the conclusions you have all reached in agreement and follow through on those actions. Prep by writing everything down first.

Where I live there is very little arts fundingsupport for teaching or performing.  years ago it was much much better but everything has slowly been cut year by year until there is almost no public money or support available  and even the schools have such limited budgets that Arts Enrichment just isnt a thing here anymore. Very sad times. I had such a different experience and so many more opportunities in the arts as a child. Kept me sane! You know?I was actually thinking more of doing training and teaching for professionals  semiprofessionals. But again  thats quite a small market. I know I probably sound really negative. But the situation of the Arts in my country really is bad. I am a Supported Artist at a midsize theatre near me. Last year they were going to have their funding cut by   we successfully fought that. And then this year the  cut happened. Of their permanent staff they had to make  out of  redundant  key arts educators teachers lighting technicians Box Office staff.

Question for you under what circumstances would you want to go visit your father in the hospital or to talk with him on the phone?  Maybe you only want to talk to him if hes apologising for all his abuse of you  but if you cant conceive of that happening then theres nothing to be gained here.  And yes there comes a point where youve given and given and given and it makes sense to start asking whats in it for me?  If hes on his deathbed thats not necessarily an exemption that it might be the last chance he has to use and abuse you is not justification enough.  Unless you say it is of course  its entirely your call.  If youre NC youre either as crazy as theyve always said  or youve paid your full measure of filial duty multiple times over and theyve no right to demand anything more from you.

9596745,0,t3_5cdqws,My ex. Introduced me to this sub and RBN but not enthusiastically she was selfish about it... but eventually let me in since my parents are covert narcs themselves.Half of the time she was a very sweet girl. She was in university for psychology she wanted to help people much in the same way that her therapists helped her.The other half of the time she was strangely selfish. When we first started dating there was this music festival that she wanted to go to same kind of music that I like... Opportunity to try mind altering drugs that I was interested in... She was very adamant about going alone. Said this was her plan that she came up with when she was single and she wanted it to remain being her plan... She didnt want to share it. She was crazy about me jealous but it only went one way... She wanted to go to this  Day music festival all by herself for some very obvious reasons... I dont know about you but for me if someone came along who had the same interests as me I would be extremely excited about having the opportunity to take them along!Her story was that her father abused and raped her for the majority of her life. Just thinking about that now makes me wonder how she could feel so safe being under the influence in an unsupervised crowd of people. I have been gullible and naive in the past I like to give people the benefit of the doubt sometimes this makes me runs into problems. I dont want to say that she was probably lying about everything and could potentially have had some other sort of mental issue but I cant ignore the facts that there were many signs that raises doubt.We were crazy about each other when things were going good. It was beyond doubt a monogamous relationship. She would get jealous about there being girls in my University program... I never worried about the boys in her program that much! We dated for about nine months. At the seven or eight month point she came forward saying that she never got to explore her bisexual urges. I very generously gave her the green light to explore sex with women but reasonably told her that if she started to develop feelings for anyone else we would have to have a talk. I didnt get into the specifics of the talk but she was smart enough to know that it would mean either choosing them or me. We even covered this in couples counselling. It seemed like it was myself and the counselor vs my exgirlfriend  its almost like she didnt think my stance was reasonable.She got turned down by one of her fellow waitresses at work she was devastated like it was her very first crush... Made me feel invisible worthless like a consolation prize. Worst of all this person often came over to my apartment to hang out with my ex girlfriend and whenever she was there she treated me like shit... I dont understand how someone could have such strong feelings for someone who treated their current significant other like crap... Isnt it normal to not appreciate people treating your boyfriend or girlfriend like crap?A new girl started working with her unlike the first girl she kept this new girl completely secret from me. I started seeing less and less of my girlfriend. One night when she was supposed to be coming home after staying out late she never did come home. I imagined the worst which is reasonable because she was a very small girl without much muscle... Anything could happen to her. It turned out that she fell asleep at her friends house... I didnt even know who her friend was my guess is it was the new girl at work but she didnt want to come out and say who it really was who she was spending time with...I didnt attack her or get aggressive or anything... I just sent her messages worrying about her safety. Then once enough time had passed I sent her messages telling her that the only thing running through my mind was her falling asleep in someone elses arms... I told her that it was tearing me apart inside and that I needed her to come home and to tell me that everything was okay and remind me she still loved me.  if she was going to have the privilege of being able to explore her sexuality with women in the middle of a committed relationship then she had to keep the responsibility of not neglecting me and our relationshipShe started telling me that I was attacking her bisexuality! She started telling me that I didnt understand what an open relationship was when clearly we made the distinction between it being open sexually and being open romantically. Weeks before this actually happened I knew it was over when she got turned down by that one coworker... When this actually happened its like the part of her that was actually good and decent just died.She continued to be on the offensive whenever we spoke... I was just being torn apart she was literally ripping my heart into shreds... And then she acted like I didnt care about her or the relationship simply because I was too devastated to confront her face to face.We went from living everyday together to an abrupt end. I was under the impression that she cared about me based on how she acted like I meant the world to her when things were going good. so even though she wasnt speaking to me I kept her up to date on my life and how I was doing.After about a month of this she finally started to respond. Nothing had changed she was in the right and I was in the wrong... I told her that her friends were fake and plastic specifically thinking about her first crush with that waitress who treated me like shit. Basically just a bunch of kids starting life as adults  only caring about themselves.I think she eventually got to the point where she blocked everything out of her mind she refused to think about it maybe because the more she thought about it the more she questioned her own actions and felt guilty? Anyways the last thing that she ever said to me was that maybe in the future we could be friends again when we are BOTH older and more mature.I was  and she was . Ive also always felt very mature for my age. I always felt more comfortable hanging out with people who are older than me. Basically she didnt want to think about any of the problems anymore... She went from claiming  of the responsibility In the Heat of the Moment to vaguely taking half of the responsibility with the excuse of being young and immature.Im sorry... But you can be immature without being narcissistic. You can be immature without taking advantage of situations and other people without never taking responsibility...I was the first person she had ever spoken to about what her father did to her except for her psychiatrists and counsellors. After me she started opening up to everyone else. I guess Im just a forgottendiscarded stepping stone in her life.,LifeAfterNarcissism,d9vztra,7,t5_30biu
9656526,0,t3_5dah80,I have done this in the past and at times still get the nonlogical I should just suffer with it thoughts in my head. I have been away from my violent and controlling Narc mother for almost  years and if I get an illnessinjury or bad day I still sometimes thing Oh I shouldnt take anything for thatsee a doctorhelp myself because someone might think I am faking it or its not that bad. It took me a long time to rewrite the script in my head and remind myself that if I am not at  then I am hurting the people around me my colleagues and my friends by not being honest. I still sometimes have to remember if I go on a trip its okay to take Advil or Tylenol with me in case I need it and its okay to take it before anything gets too bad. ,LifeAfterNarcissism,da3d9iv,12,t5_30biu
9673939,0,t1_da58laz,gt Im sorry that your daughter has a base of anxiety that was taught to her by your mother. It was actually from my narcissist mother in law which is now much better so we have contacts.gt Hopefully as she grows she will forget a lot of it especially if she doesnt ever see your mother.Sadly no... she missed about  days of school this year due to panic attacks thought it could be biological too.gt  It is probably very difficult for you to know what your daughter needs in order not to be anxious but hopefully you can figure it out. Im rooting for you.Thanks! We actually have a good basis. On these issues we buy a lot of books. In this case the book Calming the emotional storm helps a lot!gt Both of my children are thriving. Awesome!gt My younger one was never targeted and so he has never directly suffered any illeffects. We have talked to my daughter about my FILs behavior and she is old enough to understand what monsters they are.Wonderful!gt My husband is the same age as you actually. The abuse you describe sounds familiar but that is probably because all abuse is similar on a certain level. In a way yes. The details change but the underlying issues often look alike.gt The way the abuser breaks you down and makes you believe you are worthy of nothing and no one the sabotage the overwhelming sense of responsibility for things that are never a childs responsibility. Yeap! you sumarize it very well..gt Unfortunately I know exactly what you are talking about because I have seen its effects on my husband. And ugh... my inlaws purposely did not keep enough food in the house while my husband was a teenager either. Its absolutely terrifying how Ns are all so similar!Wow.. this is getting eerie! gt The effects of my husbands childhood abuse were so toxic that my marriage broke as well. I thought I was doing a good job shielding my children from my husbands toxicity but it turns out that when I thought was being a strong wife all those years I was actually being the opposite. The weak not to disparage victims of abuse just a relative term stay and take the mistreatment. okay wait thats a lot in one small paragraph. First I am really sad your husband expressed toxicity toward you. At least in my case and my wifes case our own toxicity were mainly selfdirected apart from my wifes panic attacks during the heaviest moments.But I do not think that staying or leaving is per se a strong or a weak move. It varies. Dont beat yourself up. You had  children to take care of and in your case your husband was a victim acting toxic. He needed help so you werent necessarily weak in staying.gt I think it is a failure of imagination more than anything else. I just did not know any better and could not imagine any other way of coping.Exactly dont beat yourself up. It looks like things worked up if you had left then perhaps you wouldnt be together perhaps leaving would have pushed your husband into his parents arms. God knows that was my mothers plan for breaking us up she even setup a room in her apartment just in case things dont work out with my wife.By staying its possible your protected him.gt Happy to say that my marriage survived but it has been really hard. It is... My wife and I have been working now for about  years rebuilding.gt I had to learn what it actually means to be strong. I have found my voice and I have learned how to be angry and loud and have learned to view those as positive qualities.Awesome! I am not there yet but I am getting there. To take my place.gt What complicates the healing process is that as you pointed out my husband was raised by his abusers. He has no idea of what a healthy and loving family even is. Exactly!gt It has been on me to provide that example and to stand up for my children whenever my husband reacts inappropriately to their normal behaviors. Imagine... we were BOTH raised in bad families. Its a miracle we used to be okay  years ago and a tragedy my mother reattacked.gt It has gotten easier with time. It always does.gt Also I see that when I stand up for my children it allows my husband to forgive himself for having been abused. It helps him heal too even though he often has to get past the feeling of shame first.Amazing. Good for all of you!gt Your road trip and cruise with your mother were an absolute nightmare!!! They were! My daughter was looking forward to spending time with her grandma and she mostly ignored her even during the drive while sitting next to her!My daughter wanted to show my mother the TV show Avatar the Last Airbender then her favorite show and we had all of the CDs on our portable CD player. My daughter then what  or  had calculated the number of episodes the duration the time taken to sleep the time my mother would drive and had came up with a plan to watch the show with her grandma.My mother ended sleeping almost during all of the drive even during the day because she can only function on caffeine and didnt want to drink too much to reduce the number of stops to urinate.Simple caffeine pills would have worked too! But the reality is that she didnt want to make efforts to have a relationship in which both parents are witnesses to everything she says.gt But something positive came out of it  you realized that you reached your limit and you were motivated to make a change. Indeed!gt The fear of change and of the unknown might be something that stops a lot of people from stepping away from abuse. Yeah we didnt want to cut ties because our daugher liked her grandma. This broke her desire to even see her again.gt Because at least they know what to expect from their abuser. Its comfortable in a sense. Deciding you just wont take it anymore is a very new and scary feeling and its understandable why people get stuck in bad situations.Exactly!gt I think its really important for the long term health of your family for your wife to understand that it doesnt matter why people do bad things or whether it was intentional. Unless it is a child it just doesnt matter.Yeah I am trying... slowly she is getting the point.Intellectually she understood a long time ago its emotionally...gt Youve clearly been through hell. I wish you only the best going forward. Thanks you too! And thanks for the discussion! Dont hesitate to continue it. gt How do you manage NC if you live close to you mother?By consistently rejecting contacts.For example she sent my daughter a book for her birthday by mail and a card and a book and a check for our wedding anniversary.I read both cards and told my wife and my daughter there were attacks in them and recommended they didnt read them. They agreed and I  shredded both there was nothing to use legally sadly only doubleentendre like I am sure you made a ton of friends now that you are older while knowing full well my daughter is mostly introverted and prefers few but deeper relationships.As for the check it was a way to keep tabs on us by putting both of our names on the check so if we are divorced we cant cash it and by checking which checking account is used she knows we mainly used a join account and has kept old checks.If we get divorced our joint account is dissolved...So we shredded the  check!Since then she sent emails to know if we got the gifts we ignored them.In the past when she called I would ask her not to call. ALL of our calls are now recorded and she knows it so she dare not call.,LifeAfterNarcissism,da5il7o,1,t5_30biu
9697121,0,t3_5dy9eg,Id like to offer some opinion on your apparent dilemma. Ill start with this age old quote. Those who choose to ignore the past are surely doomed to repeat it. And another Once a Narc always a Narc. I say this after three consecutive years of allowing my boundaries to be trashed by an N and that Ns ability to covertly manipulate others close to me who could influence my good conscience. Its likely two things happening here. A Your NDad had a brief moment of clarity and seized the moment to actually act with some conscience. B Your NDad is attempting to very obliquely groom you into becoming an unwary victim. The latter has happened to me three times already. The last time was only six months ago and it resulted in me creating fierce and impenetrable boundaries.I would suggest the following. Maintain your status quo at all costs. Do not at any cost make the next move and relax any of your protections. If you do and NDad decides to infiltrate your peace of mind you will lose any battles you have won because every victim learns you cannot win a battle against a N.Give it more time. You are very confused right now and the answers you are hoping for might take some time to present themselves. I strongly suggest patience and rational thinking. Give the recent events time to mature and base your actions on facts and best practices when dealing with an N.Finally never let go of what wholly protects you your gut feeling and the instincts youve had the time to refine. It may take time but the answers and the clarity of your thoughts will enlighten you. Dont let your good conscience fool you into false hopes and dreams.Take care of Yourself first.,LifeAfterNarcissism,da8dk3j,3,t5_30biu
9710361,0,t1_da9yhby,He IS pathetic that way and you described it perfectly. I just remembered an anecdote he and his wife told me during my last visit  she wanted to go to Croatia for holidays. NDad hates heat and the sea so he kept nagging and complaining until his wife cancelled the reservations. Then apparently as an excuse he gave her a journey to his childhood region as a present for their wedding anniversary instead. She was mollified. I was weirded out but didnt think much of it until I talked to my mom about that story  apparently he wanted to do that childhood journey thing for nearly a decade but my mom was always like We can do that when were too old to travel far. As long as I can I want to see the world former soviet region without free travel I can completely understand that. So with his new wife he literally kept complaining underhandedly about something he did not want to do like a little kid until his wife gave up and then made her do what he wanted to do instead dressing it up as a favourapology to her. Talk about manipulative... Its incredible how that one slipped my mind when thinking about whether he still has Ntendencies or not.    I do limit my time and contact with him especially visits but again keeping it up just enough to keep him happy. What I really have to do is to pry his invisible fingers from my mind somehow so I can stop doing what has become so second nature for me that I literally only noticed it yesterday.,LifeAfterNarcissism,daa0ech,3,t5_30biu

10221775,0,t1_dbr067y,Yeah stand your ground. Dont let him break you. My BFs Ndad says his mom is crazy and has something wrong mentally. He never fails to mention that back in the day they used to burn women for talking back. All because his mother finally mustered up the courage to move out and pursue a separation. She regrets never doing anything when her children were younger  and  yr old sons. She also said she had a friend who advised her to seek counseling at this womens shelter so that if she were to ever go to court it would be recorded that she sought helpcounseling after being abused. Im not sure if this is any help to you now but it shouldnt be hard to get evidence if he is a true Narc. And dont worry the judge in court cops etc. are used to being around psychos who charm and then attack your soul behind closed doors. Stay strong for those two girls. And if he is still in contact with your girls be careful he is not putting those girls in the middle to get them to console you and to get back together with him. Guilt tripping them for not doing anything to get the family together.lt,LifeAfterNarcissism,dc2p1e7,1,t5_30biu

11063385,0,t3_5xy27q,For me NC coming up on  years its several processes that can all be depressing all rolled into one. Im grieving for the death of the relationships I thought I had. Im grieving for the little boy who didnt know any better whose life was set down a dark road by people who were supposed to care for him. Im grieving for the relationships that got caught up in collateral damage relationships that I cant have any more with people I would gladly still claim as family simply because they refuse to hear my story.Even  years later I still cry about these from time to time.Then theres the other side that at least for me hits much harder. I fear for the way my life is going. I fear that somehow my N will find me. I fear what I know I will do if she shows up on my doorstep. I fear the part of me that I recognize as being her influence driving me to selfdestructively chase after other peoples goals for me and never to consider that I might have goals of my own for me.The anger that I wish I could let go of. Anger at my Nmother for obvious reasons. Anger at the man who enabled her and went along with everything for decades. Anger at my father who couldnt save me from her. Anger at my younger self who wouldnt have left even if the option was there.Nparents do a number on our ability to relate with the world in a healthy way. They who have the greatest ability and duty to teach us how to navigate the world to make something of ourselves to chase our dreams until we catch them and our heart until it bleeds  they who with this great power and great responsibility in our lives instead choose to warp our life to fit their molds.If I could tell you one thing to do and know that youd take it to heart it would be this cut yourself some slack. Healing doesnt happen overnight and that perfection you want is an ideal not a requirement. Keep moving in the right direction. Learn hopefully with the help of your therapist friends and family of choice to celebrate your little victories over the toxic programming written into your subconscious before you could even conceive of such a thing.This is my little victory as an example. Today I interviewed for a stable job which would be my first in nearly a decade. I made it through the entire process and the drive home before I let my innerNmomvoice say a single word and then I put her in a closet and took care of what I needed to get through the rest of the day. Thats my little celebration for the day. I managed to pretend to be a functioning adult for over an hour and thats better than Ive done in quite a while. My anxiety log only has one entry for the day and that too is a victory.Youll get there. Youre not alone on this road as much as it can feel that way  there are thousands of us cheering for you to make it in your own time and in your own way.,LifeAfterNarcissism,dem0mb5,7,t5_30biu

However I am redditing at  AM after a long work week  with my man sleeping next to me.  I can barely move my thumbs.  You are on the right path  Some people learn about life through someone teaching  them. Some of us stumble along and figure it out through our own intentions. I am about  years into no contact and I have loved the fun of teaching myself about life.  This is my shorthand lazy advice. Google the emotional scale. You can learn to self soothe. If you feel bad move up the scale slowly. Dont expect to jump to sublime happiness. No one can do that.  Look up stories of cults. Look up interviews from  the wolfpack brothers. You arent alone.
