300119,0,t3_1xgutd,sorry mate I tried to read it but I could barely make it past the first paragraph. Partially it feels like the style is forced like you are trying too hard and therefore dont come to a natural rhythm which makes it difficult to even follow. Try to let us know Thomas first the mix of his inner feelings with allusions to actions I guessed abuse kind of left me wanting to bail on the whole thing it just doesnt grab me. I agree that one should always start a story with some action but you also need to tell us who and why very early on. Try maybe scaling back the initial salaciousness of the fucked up uncle and let the reader have some feelings for Tom.I did get through it but it was a struggle much to do with how overwhelmingly depressing everything seems and also that TomThomas is both unclear as a character and uninteresting. There are also some typos and grammar that you would do well to catch before posting many people see obvious mistakes and just ignore the rest. Keep that in mind for future critiques. Also gtany moment away from that horrible man was a moment well spent in Thomas booksThe expression is in his book not plural. Just a grammatical nitpick same goes for capitalising Uncle unless this is his name it is not a proper noun. Like my mom vs Mom.,KeepWriting,cfbvfyu,1,t5_2tl2y

558283,0,t3_20ig8n,I write every day during the week at nap time andor bedtime. Sometimes I get  minutes of uninterrupted writing time sometimes I get  hours. On the weekends when my husband is home to help with the kids I generally get an hour or so to write.  EDIT Its worth it to mention I think that I average about  words a week with this writing schedule. Sometimes I get much more writing done in the ten minutes than I do in the two hours. I prevent burn out by working on the manuscript that appeals most to me at the time. Right now Im  of the way done through my current manuscript and havent felt bored yet. The last manuscript I worked on is four chapters done and hasnt been touched in a few months. When Im stuck on all my current manuscripts and feel like Ive hit the writing wall I pull out my project that has eleven years of research and delusions of grandeur and add to that. It keeps me sane. Ive noticed that when I am able to get writing and keep it up that I am able to keep the flow of the story going better and I dont have to refer back to previous chapters for information that I should remember but dont. When I dont want to write I try to make notes about what I think of an upcoming section. Oftentimes I start writing and the characters take me in a direction I didnt expect. I try to stick to my overall outline and vision for the book but also try to let my characters act for themselves. For example my main character just sprained her ankle and had to go to the hospital where she was almost poisoned by a member of an eco terrorist group.  She was originally supposed to explore an old farmhouse and then go out to dinner with friends. Slightly different. ,KeepWriting,cg3qf2y,6,t5_2tl2y

1230229,0,t1_ci7zcz3,No prob. Keep at it. Youll find your voice and natural flow.Also for vividness it helps you imagine yourself in the scene at every single moment and then explore with a fine tooth comb all of the scenes setting. Once you have a clear and detailed picture in your mind descriptions will come by easier. For example when your character plops some cocaine on the table you can say things like it explodes a small portion across the glass surface the way you would imagine confectioners sugar would creating a vivid scene takes patience and you really have to punctuate the action with the metaphorical stopping to smell the roses.,KeepWriting,ci80o4j,1,t5_2tl2y

Think about blockbusters and the amount of detail that goes into every single character. I always go to places like Harry Potter or Star Wars where each person has been given a novelization of their life before the story even begins. I feel if you gave this kind of backstory to each character and really bring it out throughout the story to make the reader hurt with each pain inflicted on that very character it would be so effective. You also stop inconsistencies in your story this way. You say shes anxiety ridden and was a child prostitute. Go detailed in these regards not to be gross to touch upon and really draw the reader as to why these things happen so its understood why she would act the way she would instead of the reader just accepting thats how she is. ,KeepWriting,ciqifoa,2,t5_2tl2y

1391347,0,t1_ciqlr7v,Well as I said I really do like the style of the piece. I think you captured the vibe very well. You do a really good job with setting a scene as well as most of the descriptions.However I didnt get the impression that the focus was meant to be on the relationship with the girl. Maybe its because of the sort of soft focus that I talked about before but the girl seems secondary or even further removed than that. I like this a lot Im just saying I would like it more if you dropped the brand names and band names and tightened the focus on the parts where youre talking about the girl. The bands and brands sort of take away from that fuzzy feeling I like. Simply saying that you put on a bluesy record goes more with the tone which is otherwise unspecific. And as for the girl I think she needs a clearer role... and I think you could pull it off simply by increasing her physical descriptions. Give her more character if shes meant to be the main point!

4819688,0,t3_3gv9my,Its true criticism is not censorship. However the kind of criticism Rice is referring to I gather is the kind of criticism that admonishes a book based on the chances that it will offend someone not the kind of  literary criticism that examines the nature and merit of the work itself. This kind of criticism based on a subjective level of offensiveness does bring about lynchmobs although maybe thats not the best term of people who seek nothing more than to deride the book and suppress it as something that society at large should not approve of or get involved withcreating a defacto kind of censorship where people avoid the novelmovieplayetcetera due to this perception. This is where it gets good though nobody cares if youre offended. Did someone saydowrite something that hurt you personally or vicariously because youre a big sympathizer to the plight of others? Congratulations heres a fucking sticker. Rather than sit there and stew in your offendedness or get all selfrighteous ask yourself more important questions like what was the intent or is there another way to think about thisis there something Im missing or even am I out of touch with reality? Sometimes the answer to all of those questions is no and then youre probably dealing with a bigot. Other times maybe the point is more purposeful or nuanced and you missed it because you were too busy buckling up your blind justice pants. More often than not youll probably fare better by dealing with something offensive by thinking it through that simply through reactionary witchhunting.

I like your analogy though keep that.You could really try bringing in some character actions with your main body of this post. What does he do when he steps into the sunlight? Does he shrug off the snow? Does he adjust his glasses whilst looking up at the sun? Does he shake himself in his coat to keep warm? Little bits of character action can bring a whole lot of personality to a character early on to help the reader to get to grasps of what your character is all about.

5190281,0,t3_3lzjsv, Buddhists believe in reincarnation. The idea is that once you die you reincarnate into someone else. Redundant Any memories of your past life have been permanently erased from your mind. Think of yourself as a hard drive inside a womb This is an unclear metaphor. You combine two completely unrelated things like a womb and hard drive. Why not use hard drive inside the CPU or a fetus inside the womb? where your memory has been completely erased. You are being recycled and you finally have a chance to begin again. Meaning recycled. Why not You are being recycled disjointed from the old body and starting afresh in life  with a new consciousness.  Youve no prior memory to tell you how to live life if theres even a proper way to do so. So youll start from zero. Youll relearn everything from walking to rocket science if you choose to go that route.   Bring the if clause to the beginning. Its clearer like that.  If you follow the JudeoChristianIslamic tradition Abrahamic faith   then you learn that you only truly live once. And Anything after that is merely the definition ?? Expand definition of your previous choices from your only life. You are either in heaven or in hell. Perhaps in these places choices arent real and you have no real power. Why? Whats in a choice? Is a choice really a choice if youre forced to pick between A and B without any real knowledge of what youre going to do? Expand this. This is fallacious. Is choice merely an illusion? Perhaps Maybe is better. you are merely living in a dream where you feel like you have a choice AFTER dont capitalize. It makes the other words cringe. the event has transpired and youve yet to understand whatever choice you feel youve made.Here I would like to add that you use a lot of you in your writing. Try juggling with you we our us person one people community the mass the society at specific points to add clarity. Since this is really long you need an editor to sort through the entire piece and before that you need to rewrite most of it. Trust me first drafts look awful in the beginning.

Everyone was way too optimistic happy and too much of the bullshit feelgood atmosphere. It kinda made me feel sick for a while and it was initially awkward to talk to him in the car about my opinions. However I did in fact tell my friend about how I honestly felt. While it was a shitty experience it helped me clear the writers block that Ive had for a while or at least I think.I think I will rework the premise of the story. I honestly didnt have much knowledge of the dark web and it might be too unethical for me to write about it but I do have a good understanding of Wall Street from personal experience.I think I will rewrite the second chapter for Hikari to trick Tatsuya into joining some kind of a MLM company even though she doesnt work there to test his psychological resilience god its even better than I thought because hikkikomoris are already susceptible as hell to social interactions because they are inherently antisocial.Once he overcomes this test the truth will finally be revealed. Hikari is actually working as Tatsuyas uncle as her protege. The three eventually convene in an unmarked office somewhere in Tokyo havent decided yet but its gonna be somewhere upscale  also gives me a chance to look at Google Maps for some of the beautiful architecture in Japan. Tatsuyas uncle reveals the truth. Plot twist? The purpose of the contract was to force his hand and get him to think. If he committed suicide like most have in his position weakminded that wouldve been fine for him and that wouldve been the end of that. However Tatsuya still owes him the money but in a different sense. His uncle gives him k to play in the stock market the typical income of a salaryman I might be wrong about this and he is required to generate the amount he owed in the contract within the one year time frame  a relatively easy task according to his uncle.However if I choose this route I will need to seriously consider Hikaris character because I dont know how to develop her anymore.,KeepWriting,d2wzfc7,1,t5_2tl2y
