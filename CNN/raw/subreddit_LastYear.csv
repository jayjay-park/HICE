2587120,0,t3_2pfqps,Regarding Theresa I think the vaulting mechanic would be a bit OP. She could just vault over anything to avoid the killer and it would be very frustrating to run after her considering the other survivors are ALREADY faster than her. I also feel as if you could abuse the predator mechanic of the killers making him unable to despawn to go after other survivors since she could just look at you and run away if you try to go after her. I also feel like the characters usefulness would be for that and that only...distractions. Too linear.Brent on the other hand seems like a really cool idea. I like the hitormiss concept with the paintball gun how its high risk high reward. Id love it if when the killer is hit with a paintball he has a paintygook over the screen and most of his vision is obscured with a color for a few seconds. This would allow for the kids to run and sneak by while the killer might still be able to luckily hit one of them on the way out.,LastYear,cmw9vw6,1,t5_32t96
