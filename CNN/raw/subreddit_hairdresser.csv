Ive seen it on darker skinned people and it works pretty well for them. Plus if you decide you dont like it you will have to put your hair through more stress to get rid of it. If youve been getting it highlighted for a while I would imagine its already a little damaged. Hope this helped!,hairdresser,dchav4y,1,t5_2so84
