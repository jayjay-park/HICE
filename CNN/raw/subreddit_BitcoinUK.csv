1136300,0,t1_chxdlij,There were no issues when I used the phone and it went though in a few seconds. Same price not sure where they got the conversion from though. I found out that the owner is a bitcoin enthusiast and set everything up but the actual people working dont know all that much about it. They said the owner has one or two more pubs in London which is where he livesand they also take bitcoin. ,BitcoinUK,chxfzrl,1,t5_2wq3q

4525524,0,t1_ct12gsx,They are simply desperate for anything that looks like real economy.. fixing the last problem then neglected its not that they are probusiness and the difference as always is too much the short term reactions.Its frustrating that they havent encouraged banks to consider digital currencies in a friendly way that allows small business accounts to function. Digital currencies could be considered like cash.. businesses do still support cash and banks dont deny them. The fear of having accounts closed is stifling progress.,BitcoinUK,ct12wrg,1,t5_2wq3q

4969280,0,t3_3iytjn,Little will change until the banks get behind the spirit of Bitcoin.. trying to do the same traditional banking without adapting to the new reality will only slow done adoption. If they can take the stick out of their arses and allow use of the BTC blockchain and other . chains like BitShares that peg value of tokens to assets then that would be best for a faster uptake in the UK. Banks more widely need to allow blockchain businesses to play with the technology without challenging all transactions and closing accounts. The more limiting finregs are the more likely some other country will become the blockchain centre of expertise and innovation.One approach to bankblockchain interactions would be to consider that digital currency is like cash.. you dont expect to know every detail of every cash transaction.,BitcoinUK,cukwy26,3,t5_2wq3q
