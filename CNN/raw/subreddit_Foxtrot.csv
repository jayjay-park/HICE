I consider FoxTrot to be a kind of precursor to Web comics considering the huge amount of geek humor and inside jokes like a page of Java code as a crucial part of the joke or a reference to early Internet memes. With that said the Jason and Marcus as Frodo and Sam storyline was hilarious considering the miniscule amount of attention that LotR had before the movies came out FoxTrot went ahead and ran a weeks worth of comics that were mainly only funny to people who read the books. I am also partial to the comic where Jason runs around chanting All Your Base Are Belong To Us for the same reason.Other than that I have a soft spot in my heart of the Who Stole Eileens Journal? story especially the ending. ,Foxtrot,cqcodu7,2,t5_2uget

Or the more likely scenario he was tacking the script on to a server purchased for other reasons perhaps a personal website but now no longer can or wishes not to pay to keep onlineLooking at the script itself it has to be running at all times. The script works by comparing the image source of the new Foxtrot strip to the image source of the previous one and if theyre different it will post the new one. But the reference to the previous strip is stored in memory not permanently in a database or some other nonvolatile storage service. This means that if the script is halted for any reason moving power outage server maintenance etc it will lose a reference to the previous strip. When the script it started again it will post the newest strip even if its already been posted because the script itself has no reference to what strips it has previously posted. Correct me if Im wrong but if the script does halt the maintainer would need to consciously start it only when a new strip is available otherwise risk double posting. Hooking the script up to a database like Firebase or a NoSQL service would be an enhancement and luckily this is pretty lightweight database stuff so it would easily fit within the free tiers of virtually all SAAS platforms.Unfortunately I dont own any personal servers so if I were to take over I would host it on Heroku or a similar platform the cost of which would not be free. I do pay for a server for a personal website but that runs on PHP and I eventually intend to migrate it over to Node. Neither of these are compatible with the script as it exists currently Python. This is why Im curious as to how the previous maintainer was hosting it because its not exactly costeffective to host such a minor script on a hosting platform unless it doesnt cost him anything.,Foxtrot,cz3n4lk,1,t5_2uget
