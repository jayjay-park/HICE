625956,0,t3_21bc5s,The end of the article is a strange contrast to the quote in the title of this post. It paints the common picture of everyone migrating online and being isolated and depressed. I see social media more as a way to transcend space and time to have interactions with people we really want to socialize with but couldnt practically before.We seem to be finally on the cusp of real immersive VR for the masses with products like Oculus Rift. The possibilities for VR are so much broader than games. Virtual presence seems destined to be as big or bigger than games. Getting friends and family around the world into the same virtual room holding a business meeting watching a sporting event or sight seeing.The technology is going to go far beyond the Facebook wall. I think well come to see the online virtual world as one without many of the limitations of the physical world. Itll often be the best way to have rich human interactions and let us fairly naturally fulfill our social desires in ways that werent conceivable before.,Manna,cgbf7dh,2,t5_2wku4

The bottom of the performance range gets axed to the point you working half as many people as hard as a full staff. You cant keep performance at  indefinitely without a breakdown.,Manna,cmk24ss,2,t5_2wku4
