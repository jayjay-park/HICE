6837405,0,t3_49ev0e,Finished up my first week of UHF week. Loving the fullbody workout. It kicked my ass but was much more manageable than when I ran  full bodyfull boring SBD every workout  days a week was way too much.IG here for anyone interested in following my progress.One question I have if you track your weekly volume how do you account for equivalent volume for variations that require higher effort? E.g. deficit deadlifts paused squatsdeads etc. Youre moving lighter loads that are more difficult. Are there any approximate modifiers like deadlift volume  weight x reps x set x .n where n  inches of deficit?Im curious what your daughter would think of old s movies like thisLastly you said tasteful nudes...Have you considered covering up that mug with a beard? They might stop IDing you when youre buying tickets for Rrated movies.,gzcl,d0rbmgh,2,t5_33j1o
6899976,0,t1_d0yde3m,Man solid PRs for sure! Great work there and Im very amped to see how well you do on this nd cycle through the UHF! Doubling your reps or more! on your main movements TM is excellent. As for the box squats I think thatll work pretty good. If anything you could even start it at  and go . IMO box squats are a bit easier to recover from if youre doing them to just parallel and therefore you can push the intensity up a bit than youd usually expect. ,gzcl,d0yfirb,2,t5_33j1o

7031633,0,t3_4buvlp,Youre still hitting more than  reps on your AMRAPs so its not like youre stalling out. Its suggested that you add  lbs every week on GZCLP so you could potentially be adding  lbs per month to at least the lower body lifts. Id keep running it until you actually start stalling out. Definitely add on more T volume as long as you can recover from it.,gzcl,d1de255,2,t5_33j1o

Some advice if you want you could look up some old videos about Matt Ogus i know hes a pretty strongaesthetic guy whove previously been running  for over a year. Right now I think youve gone overboard with the accessories which I myself have also done a couple of times. Also many strong guys Pete Rubish and Wendler himself recommend sticking to  training a week not because one has a tight schedule or anything lifestyle taxing just because its some times better for youre body and better for recovering even though youre able to do nothing but sleep all day its most of the times the best choice. Anyways thats my  cents I too have summer vacation atm and Im sleeping my ass off while still hitting the only gym  times a week max not because i couldnt train  times a week simply cause it can be a regressive state.,gzcl,d5llwd9,0,t5_33j1o

I just take a guess at what my RM should be based upon the previous weeks performance and how warm ups feel if I go too light Ill do extra reps normally only  or . Ill then adjust the rest of the tt if I was significantly out e.g. dont push amrap if i picked a too heavy weight for the RM. Really the difference between hitting e.g. a RM or RM is negligible in terms of stimulus but I find a big difference in performance from knowing Im hitting my one all out heavy set rather than thinking I might have to go for another.Just my  pennies.,gzcl,d86oe0s,4,t5_33j1o

I do like your idea of increAsing frequency of bench by moving around when I deadlift. I have to say Ive tried a few different ways and the best way for me to consistently squat and deadlift twice a week at high intensity without fatigue is for me to do them on the same days.  The drastic drop in intensity makes it fairly manageable but I certainly am open to trying to switch it up.  Quite honestly I just dont see my legs as a weak point perhaps when Im seeing plateus on my squat and dead I will add accessories but I simply dont see much reason to add any leg accessories currently.
