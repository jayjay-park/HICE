9297937,0,t1_d8uche6,gt Gravitational fucking waves. Just that theory. You can prove something as conclusively as mother fucking gravitational waves Compare the words in bold. Try to reconcile them. The one in italic is extra credit Now compare these in bold Science does create theories purely on nondirect evidence  until recently the idea of gravitational waves was such an idea.You see that they actually meant hypothesis. A mere idea idea. An educated guess. A potential. Gravity waves as a hypothesis was not a scientifically established theory like gravity itself. Even gravity as a theory isnt proven. What is proven is the results of everyday experiments for gravity and the results of everyday experiments for matter but its obviously incomplete because the shapes of galaxies break the theory. So we have to invent dark matter as a placeholder until we have a scientific theory that matches all observations. You wouldnt be the first person to stomp and huff and curse proclaiming themselves an ultimate authority. Falsely. And you wont be the last.
