181062,0,t3_1w5zh2,I remember your house from some of your other posts and I really dig it.I think your wall color is way too dark. Makes the space look smaller and complicates it. The tile counters are awesome and I usually dont like them but I love yours! But since the tile is so loud I say do something more subtle with the walls. It also does not seem MCM to me.Curtains that were grey with a MCM yellow pattern on them may tie things together and then you could do light grey walls. Yes I love to use grey. I love your use of it in your main room and I would not be afraid to use a lighter version of the same color here. It will make the white cabinets pop...all the white pop and goes really well with yellow.Consider doing a faucet like this in chrome to match your hardware and the stove chrome. Love your hardware and I think your should keep it. You could do something re faucets for  to  on overstock or  on aliexpress. I got awesome modern pulls from aliexpress and I will be trying a mod faucet for our rental property. Have had the hansgrohe in stainless for  months and it is awesome to use and beautiful.Maybe change to a white sink with a metal band around it or even a white overmount ceramic sink if you can find one that fits. This glossy white will tie into your awesome stove.TDLR reduce the amount of materials and tone down the walls to a neutral like grey. A rad faucet is a great opportunity to MCM it up a bit.,Mid_Century,cez25bh,6,t5_2syz6

389748,0,t1_cfkr3ly,Ive been thinking about this a lot and Im sure theres a college thesis in it somewhere.It seems to me it has something to do with the rise of political conservatism in the English speaking world.  The post war generation was rapidly embracing all kinds of modernity.  From Tang to aluminum Christmas trees.What we call mid century modern is what Scandinavian just calls furniture.  If youve never visited a Nordic nation its almost an overload of wonderful modern design  everywhere all over the place.Meanwhile back here in the United States the boomer generation seemed to embrace the esthetic and taste of their grandparents while rejecting their post war parents embrace of modern design  but in a very superficial way.    So you might recognize something like this.   years ago something like this was necessary to survive the winter.  A boomer probably uses it for recycling or to store trash bags.  Its totally goofy as it places nostalgia ahead of functionality or form.You see it everywhere.  From suburbia filled with so called McMansions all of them designed to look vaguely like an old farm house to eateries like Cracker barrel that nail all kinds of kitsch to the wall.Heres my most hated example.  This beautiful mid century modern builidng at Gettysburg  was torn  down and replaced with this monstrosity of generic and superficial design.  In some regards its changing.  Modern design is in resurgence along with a rejection of political conservatism.Im not saying the correlation is causal at all but I think it is related to the mindset of the people involved.,Mid_Century,cfl5vwi,5,t5_2syz6

2960007,0,t3_2u2qcy,Theres this Facebook group in my city where people spot and report dumpsters with potentially valuable amp usable stuff. Often these are temporary street dumpsters during renovations moves and so on. Someone posted that these kind of chairs were at a dumpster so in  minutes I was out of my home heading there and managed to get four of these chairs to myself.These are exactly the kind of chairs Ive been looking for and for the past weeks Ive been checking different sales sites if I could find some. Earlier I posted about how I found a midcentury dining table from a dumpster and these chairs are simply perfect for that table I now have.Im  sure these are model called Tuoli  literally Chair  designed by Kurt Hvitsj in  for Finnish furniture company Isku. They mainly came in birch color and you can see the Tuoli  in dinner setting in here Now the chairs I have are somewhat different. The back of the chair is higher and curved whereas in the standard Tuoli  the back is lower and the profile is straight.My friend who has worked as a designer for Isku said that the veneer seems to be some tropical hardwood veneer which would imply these are variations of Tuoli  meant to be more luxorious amp for home use instead of offices and schools but might also mean these are Swedish or Danish or from somewhere else Europe as in the s they didnt really care about copyrights and everyone just copied each other.These kind of chairs are most commonly known as school chairs in Finland as they were the standard for school chairs here decades ago. After that these kind of models have become increasingly sought after and in the Facebook group people were really eager to get these. Isku recently started producing modernized versions of these kind of chairs which I find quite odd as majority of the people want the old chairs with wooden surfaces. The old models are often in interior design blogs articles and sold quite quickly.The chairs I have are generally in average to poor condition and need some repairing. These are in theory stackable but the stacking has over the decades caused the wooden parts to wear out on the edges. Some of the chairs have the veneer chipped of and one has golden paint stains. Next Ill head to rwoodworking to ask some tips.Other product from Isku Id like to note is this ergononic chair designed to accomodate male genitalia.,Mid_Century,co4kf2r,8,t5_2syz6

I have attempted an oriental MCM theme over the last  years kind of a Shanghai in the s vibe. Think Dr Nos lair from James Bond.

7006945,0,t3_4bmof3,Really need more pictures to properly assess this piece.  Based on your picture I would guess that this is an american made piece from the s r s.  There is nothing significant about the piece from a design prospective.  If you are asking if you had  all in on this piece would you be able to get your money back?  Then I would say the answer is an easy no.  Even in a retail environment this thing fully rehupolstered would only be worth in the ish range and if I were selling this on Craigslist which I wouldnt be because I wouldnt buy it in its current condition I would probably be happy to get .  I think the problem is the upholstery really isnt that bad and some people like that vintage fabric ugly look.  So the shop owner is not selling the piece as a rehab project but as a usable piece.  Think about it this way if you are going to recover and refoam then all you need  is the bones I wouldnt want to pay extra for fabric and foam that I will just replace.  Another thing to consider that sofas and day beds are tough sells on craigslist due the bed bugs issue.  Most people are afraid to purchase stuff like that. ,Mid_Century,d1akz1d,3,t5_2syz6

10731847,0,t3_5tja8n,This Flexsteel sofa is the final piece for my dining room. I got it for such a steal I can afford some good reupholstery fabric... which Ill need since the gold clashes badly with my beloved but orange Jerry Johnson sling chair. Any suggestions on textile type and color? I tend to love woven texture nubby boucle linen and the like. Im thinking warm grey but open to suggestions. For reference heres everything thats in the room  a vintage kilim some Maharam fabric thatll go on two Gunlocke chairs and the sling chair. Thanks!,Mid_Century,ddmwrfy,3,t5_2syz6
10732001,0,t3_5tja8n,Id keep that color! It doesnt clash too bad with the Jerry Johnson. If anything Id reupholster the sling chair because thatd be MUCH less expensive. Maybe in a black or very dark brown leather. ,Mid_Century,ddmxc0u,20,t5_2syz6
10733925,0,t1_ddmwrfy,Also Dorell Fabrics Cordova line is to my knowledge and the result of five years of hunting the only truly midcentury styled nubby linen thats still in production.

10776628,0,t3_5u4c4u,That is a sexy chair! It seems like it might be a bit odd but how do you think it would sit to leave the back open and only add a seat cushion? I would love to be able to see the ribs from the front. ,Mid_Century,ddrj573,1,t5_2syz6
10786240,0,t1_ddrx8mb,Thank you for the link.The vintage one I am considering buying is according to the seller made of teak veneer.For the one youre linking its not clear to me whether its made of teak or if it has a teak finish. In one place they talk about teak as a wood option but then in other place they say finish option.I dont think Ive ever seen new furniture for sale that contains actual teak in it.What do you think?,Mid_Century,ddsith4,1,t5_2syz6

11090045,0,t1_deoq1nw,So Im actually looking to buy a very similar style for myself right now. Joybird has one that I like better and theyve got it in different sizes apartment vs normal It will depend on your budget though. Ive been eyeing Joybirds vs Crate and Barrels vs Manhattan Home Design I like Joybirds the best but I dont know how their quality is. Theyve also got a concave arm version.Edit as I looked at the ebay one I see that its strayed a bit from the original West Elm chair. They might not be what youre looking for. You can definitely check out the sites listed above for other chairs though!,Mid_Century,dep1pb4,1,t5_2syz6
11116434,0,t3_5ypwm5,Thanks!  That was very interesting not only about the chair but the whole body language accents and general attitude of the time. ,Mid_Century,des1ee5,7,t5_2syz6

11216485,0,t1_df314mx, for a set or per chair? Thats quite the surprise. I went back and picked up the last  armless chairs. There are some minor nicks on some of the wooden edges on the seats on some of the chairs which Im sure decreases value. Thanks for responding Im glad they caught my eye though. ,Mid_Century,df3difr,1,t5_2syz6
11279328,0,t1_df9pvmc,Thankfully no that was the asking price. I made an offer for less and they accepted. The scale and color of the piece is much more impressive in person than small of his smaller pieces.,Mid_Century,dfahudr,1,t5_2syz6
11352529,0,t1_dfifv5i,That is lame. You should have told her its missing the whole back piece that the table comes off of and its worth  or less until she replaces that missing part. ,Mid_Century,dfisdsk,4,t5_2syz6
