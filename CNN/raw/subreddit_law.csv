30482,0,t3_1ugefm,As others have mentioned unless licensed you should only be attempting to understand the law not give legal advice to others.I would suggest using one of the supplements law students use since they are designed as a learning source for nonlawyers rather than as a dense reference source for practicing lawyers.  Go to your local law library at a nearby law school when it is open to the public usually  MF at private schools and browse the various series of supplements to decide which is your favorite series.  I would highly suggest the Examples amp Explanations series other common series are Nutshell Emanuel and Gilbert though the latter two are probably too dry and just a list of the rules. The core firstyear subjects at law schools are usually Torts Contracts Property Constitutional Law Criminal Law and Civil Procedure after those in the second year are probably Criminal Procedure Corporations and Administrative Law.  You can easily find these used on Half.com or Amazon by students especially if you get the previous older edition which is probably fine for your purposes.Perhaps Im being overly cynical but substantively law school doesnt teach you much more than you get out of an Examples amp Explanations book.  The secondary benefits are questioning your assumptions and beliefs by your professor using the socratic method raising the bar for what you consider hard work by your course load and the competitiveness and demanding better attention to detail by your journal work.,law,cehwhu7,1,t5_2qh9k

With enough exposure to legal parlance which only a fulltime lawyer can afford to do you internalize the skill and it becomes a natural way of doing things for you.

64846,0,t1_celoeej,Its a bit more complicated than that which is to say not so straightforward. It arises partly from a dispute I have with them about their really shitty heart monitors which appeared to work fine when I first checked the place out but actually only work sometimes and not well when they do. I asked them to recommend a heart monitor I could buy myself that would work with their machines and they did not understand  even though its clearly written on every machine. By coincidence I had a bout of gout which made it impossible for me to use footpowered cardio equipment. I asked if they had a UBE armbike and had to explain to a gym what the hell that is. It was pretty clear by that point that I was dealing with amateurs who put on a good act of having it together and I just wanted out. Thats when I got the condescending Its up to you to read the contract.... The kid was absolutely right of course but you had to hear his tone of voice. If it was possible to punch someone over the phone Id be up on charges right now.The disability thing is iffy because unless youre permanently disabled or at least disabled to the term of the contract all you can get is a suspension or extension not a cancellation. And they can require a doctors note  meaning you pay so you dont have to pay. Or they can require you to get a physical  again pay in order to not pay.

228249,1,t1_cf3v9mj,You are fundamentally misreading the quote. She began to express her gender preference at age two. Im sure you began to express your gender preference when you were two because everyone begins to express themselves at that age.You make your gender preference known in the way you dress and the way you act and the activities you involve yourself in. You fall in some spectrum between prototypical masculinity where all you can do is grunt and break things and prototypical femininity where it is sugar and spice and everything nice. At some point in your life probably not at  you decided that you lay closer to one of those extremes than the other and wanted others to consider you of that gender. It probably wasnt a real meaningful decision for you since everyone already assumed you were of the gender matching your biological sex but you nonetheless made the decision to continue to be a he or she and not reject the label that you had been given.So when saying that this girl began expressing her trans nature at age two all that means is that she began rejecting the activities and behaviors that one associates with being a boy. It doesnt mean she woke up the morning after her second birthday and walked into her parents room and said Ive been considering my gender identity and reading about gender disorders in the DSM and decided that I would like to live the rest of my life as a transgirl. It just means that she began rejecting the toys intended for boys and expressing a preference for those toys intended for girls.Its really not that hard to understand.

248416,0,t1_cf67oil,Im going to help you out here by answering and discussing the question that you should have asked rather than the question you tried to frame in a way that made you sound erudite but ended up sounding like babbling nonsense.What you really wanted to ask here is I dont really believe in free will in the classic sense from that perspective how can we justify imposing criminal liability on individuals? Is it ethically proper to punish people when our imposition of punishment is generally predicated on an assumption that the individual was morally culpable for the criminalized behavior they engaged in?That would have been a legitimate question though it wouldnt have been a legal question and this is rlaw. The simplest and most practical answer to your question is that a system of criminal punishment is to some degree necessary for the efficient functioning of a modern society.To answer your question in more depth requires looking at the policy justifications for criminal punishment in general. Wikipedia offers a fairly solid and succinct overview for the general justifications behind criminal punishment. The only component of criminal punishment in which a defendants moral culpability really matters significantly is the concept of retribution. For other purposes such as rehabilitation or incapacitation it doesnt matter whether the defendant was culpable  or even whether they had free will to commit the crime.,law,cf6i34a,3,t5_2qh9k

The jury need never make a decision.The system is biased towards the defense for an assortment of reasons. One of those reasons is that back when we lived on the isles the King would sometimes be an ass and start prosecuting people who did no wrong which is why we had Juries in the first place but even that may not always be enough because the King could find other ways to abuse the system by making things that everyone agrees should be legal into crimes.We obviously have more protections both procedural and legislative that limit the risk of things that should be legal being turned into crimes and people being prosecuted for them but we still have people like Edward Snowden.

At least we know where your biases are. gtDo you really believe that the value of knowing the defendant uses the word dope is not completely outweighed by the prejudicial value of Im the biggest dope dealer and I serve all over town.I dont know. I find it difficult to make judicial rulings from one sentence in a news article. I generally prefer to leave these kinds of decisions up to the judges who have heard all of the information have had years of trial experience and who can make an informed choice. gtSuppose the judge ruled that the second line was prejudicial but that the prosecutor could tell the jury that the defendant wrote a rap song which used the drug terms key pound and dope. Do you really think any prosecutor would bother putting that in front of the jury?Yes probably. It still shows familiarity with and use of narcotics trafficking terms. You use the word key as an abbreviation for kilogram exclusively in narcotics trafficking. No one says Im going to the store to get a key of sugar. The defense is free to argue that its an artistic lyric with no other meaning and the jury is free to make a decision based on their own experiences. I dont know why you think a jury is so incapable of weighing evidence.gtIn this instance the value of knowing that someone understands the meaning of dope is so low that it seems virtually impossible for any factfinder to ever put the correct weight on it.The value is so obviously low that it is impossible for a jury determine its value?

Consideration is provided on the part of the gambler by making the wager. He is staking something of value to participate. Chance means that the outcome of the contract to pay is based anything but skill. One roll of the dice one deal of the deck one spin of the wheel.

663443,0,t3_21qz1u,You dont have to have a permanent injury to be able to sue.  However a medical malpractice case will not be economically feasible for you or an attorney unless your damages will merit a large award at the end of the case.In order to prevail on a medical malpractice case you must show that your injury happened when a doctor or other medical provider fell below the standard of care.  The only way to do this is through expert testimony from other doctors or medical providers.  This is really expensive.  A medical malpractice attorney will advance these costs to you but they will eventually be paid out of the proceeds from the case.  To give you an idea how expensive these cases can be the last med mal case my firm ran we spent about  in costs before any settlement negotiation began.  If an attorney is going to advance those kind of costs on a case your damages would need to be worth several orders of magnitude higher than that to make it worth the cost.Also there is never any guarantee that your case will be settled.  Med mal cases have a higher probability of going all the way to trial which is both very expensive and very risky.  The majority of med mal jury verdicts are defense verdicts meaning the plaintiff takes nothing.

761605,0,t3_22vfnl,The legal education system starting with undergrad and all the way through the bar exam is mainly a series of hurdles to see if an individual can manage to get over them.  None of them correlate in any way with predicting success in the legal field.  Also for law school to keep meaning whatever it means to employers and so forth it has to resemble what it was so it tends not to change too quickly.Part of the reason for requiring undergrad has to do with the structure of legal education in the U.S.  In general the material taught in law school is too difficult and too demanding for the vast majority of highschool graduates to tackle so at least a couple years of college is useful just to weed out those who arent likely to succeed in academia.  UKbased systems where law is an undergrad curriculum are entirely different from the US system of legal education and dont compare well.

882360,0,t1_ch447lt,The best advice I can give is an ounce of prevention is worth more than a pound of cure. The best way to deal with unreasonable clients is to temper their expectations from day one. NEVER give clients a number value to their case before youre ready to send a settlement demand and NEVER tell them how great their case is even if you think its great. If you ever tell them they have a slam dunk case or tell them its worth X.XX they will never get that idea out of their head regardless of what bad facts come out as the case progresses. A cases value is always in flux and impossible to properly evaluate until its done. Tell them all the bad parts of their case as soon as you figure them out because you dont want to wait on that. For whatever reason everyone always thinks they have a M case and the longer you wait to tell them it simply isnt true the harder it will be later on. I tell clients the first day I meet with them that Im not going to make them rich.Apart from that dont be afraid to tell them theyre wrong and dont let them walk all over you.

970292,0,t1_chehnhu,gt I cannot think of a single instance where downloading a copy of a movie that you bought at WalMart would be considered fair use. Its clearly infringement.Well an obviously legal instance although you may not think it counts as downloading would be if you were to stream the video from one device to another directly attached device on which it was played in realtime.Now what if you stream the video from one device that you own to another device that is not immediately attached but networked through the internet?  It is not obviously the case that this would be considered infringing.I will note here that unlike printed media there is no firm technical distinction between copying realtime media and playing it playing it always produces a copy in some form possibly digital.  The legal distinction is going to have to make use of the purpose of the user.I also would really like to hear about a case where a user put a DVD into his computer found that it did not play for some reason downloaded a copy played it while the nonfunctioning DVD was still in the computer and was then found by a court to be infringing.  I do believe that such a finding is possible but I have never heard of one.  Maybe it has never happened.  If not the opposite ruling does seem to me to be possible as well.  I dont think the opposite ruling would have any solid basis in copyright law  but it would still be possible because a ruling of infringement would be absurd and sometimes judges do not like to make absurd rulings even when they are legally correct.gt And if your DVD has DRM on it you dont have the right to make copies.Youre alluding to the DMCA but the DMCA does not have anything to do with the right to make copies.  That has to do with the right to employ technical means of defeating DRM.  In fact media can be copied without employing DRMcircumvention even when that media employs DRM.  In particular DVD media can be copied without removing the CSS encryption from the media.  The CSS encryption is not designed to prevent copying it is designed to prevent playback using unauthorized players.  It is entirely possible to copy a DVD  in encrypted form  without circumventing DRM.  The copy can then be played using an authorized player again without circumventing DRM.It is also possible to copy media using a camera and a microphone.  That is considered copyright infringement when the rights are not available but I do not believe it would be considered a violation of the DMCA.  If there is any case law on this question I would really like to hear about it.The DMCA is a strange law for sure.  It is very counterintuitive.  Even if you have the legal right to copy something it can forbid you from using certain means to do it.  But that does not mean you do not have the legal right to copy something that you otherwise would.  That is even stated in the DMCA.It is also important to note that the DMCA has many exemptions including this onegt    Motion pictures on DVDs that are lawfully made and acquired and that are protected by the Content Scrambling System when circumvention is accomplished solely in order to    accomplish the incorporation of short portions of motion pictures into new works for the purpose of criticism or comment and where the person engaging in circumvention believes    and has reasonable grounds for believing that circumvention is necessary to fulfill the purpose of the use in the following instances       Educational uses by college and university professors and by college and university film and media studies students       Documentary filmmaking       Obsolete software and video game formats.

For most joint degrees it isnt going to hurt you in the job market but it might not help you much either.I would do some extensive career research before you make this decision.  Is there a specific field that you want to work in that would utilize both degrees?  If so what are the paths that are necessary to reach your desired career.  Do you want to work in a law firm?  Even if you dont will you need get some experience in a law firm before you will be able to work in the job that you want many people dont realize that most companiesorganizations wont hire lawyers straight out of law school because law school doesnt adequately teach you how to practice the law  you are expected to get at least  years of training and experience in a firm before you lateral to a in house legal position.If you do need to get a job at a law firm you should do your research and determine what firms do the type of work that is related to your field and will give you the experience you need to get the job you want.  Do those firms recruit at your school?  If they do what is their offer rate for  students at your school?  What does that firm generally think about joint degrees in those programs?  Do they see the joint degree as a benefit or is it unnecessary?  Would they be more or less willing to make an offer to a student with the joint degree?I would be confident in the answers to each of these questions before you decide to commit an extra year and a lot of money to the joint degree program.  Also remember the cost of the joint degree is not just the extra year of tuition but the opportunity cost that results from spending another year out of the work force.Im not trying to dissuade you from pursuing the joint degree.  I know several law students that got a joint degree and were successful in using it to get legal jobs in niche areas of the law and have great careers now.

1245773,0,t3_28cdte,Im not a Texas lawyer so I am not sure on Texas specifics but most states have an appellate procedure for newly discovered evidence that would entitle a person to a new trial.For a more concrete example in Michigan one making a claim of newly discovered evidence must show  that the evidence itself was new not merely its materialityin other words its usefulness   the newly discovered evidence is not cumulative meaning that there wasnt other evidence that purported to show the same thing and the new evidence just supports the previous evidence  using reasonable diligence the defendant could not have discovered and produced the evidence at trial and  the new evidence makes a different result probable on retrial.If Michigans test were applied to this case without knowing the specifics of the case in great detail I would hazard a guess that this evidence passes muster.  The knowledge of the fault is new it is not cumulative as far as I know the woman did not allege this specific defect and this defect was not as clearly established.  Based on the coverup there is no way that the woman would have reasonably known to or been able to discover the existence of the defect.  Finally knowing that the complete loss of control is most certainly attributed to a defect that causes a vehicle to suddenly lose all power steering power brakes air bags and other driver assistance and safety features I find it hard to believe that a different result on retrial is not likely.Keep in mind that this test in Michigan would only entitle the person to a new trial it would not render them innocent.  However in light of this evidence unless there are significant extenuating circumstances in this case I would hope that the prosecution would chose to dismiss the charges and let the woman go.EDIT As the replies below me point out the woman in this case pleaded guilty which introduces a whole new dimension to any potential appeals and may affect her ability to claim newly discovered evidence.

1369539,0,t1_ciny9r5,The short answer is because the Dictionary Act says so.  Basically its an act passed by congress in the late nineteenth century that gives specific meanings to a bunch of common terminology imagine if plurals and singulars werent treated the same unless specified every time unless Congress says that it wants the word to mean something else in a specific context.  According to that act person includes corporations.Sometimes the courts have said Theres no way Congress really meant to use the Dictionary Act here.  They really meant X so I think everyone can at least see a silver lining in this case that opinion basically says all judges have to go by the Dictionary Act unless the laws specifies.  This should make for more predictability in court rulings and less fear of inconsistent statute interpretations.Im not familiar with historical backgrounds of considering the corporation as an extension of the individuals theres a bunch of things to do with veil piercing but Im a lowly L and dont know that stuff yet but Alitos argument was that the corporation only exists to further their interests so it wouldnt make sense for it to not allow them to pursue their own interests.

You seem to indicate that a person without mental health problems is just as likely to have a mental breakdown or episode as someone with a mental illness. I would be very surprised if that were true.  As to crime I think youre confusing rights and privileges. If you sexually molest a child you lose the privilege of being a teacher or school bus driver. If you criminally defraud someone you lose the privilege of being able to practice law. Law may not be rocket science but its certainly closer to the F than a Kia in the analogy. Its not that working one case is super demanding but working  cases at once without screwing any up and providing zealous representation on every case while working  hours per day certainly is exponentially more demanding than the average Americans job.

This individual has a history of claiming to be a constitutional lawyer yet all evidence strongly suggests this is false.  Three years ago he was  and a computer engineer  Looks like he was still doing that a year ago and just nine months ago he was so green on the law that he thought the nowinfamous Verizon production order was a warrant  Three months ago he despised lawyers who help criminals. and actually believed detainees dont have constitutional rights in gitmo prison and to think the Boumediene case was only six years ago.  Then suddenly a month later hes a constitutional law expert with a great wellestablished career as a lawyer  So his claim is he managed to go to law school and establish that career in  month.  The ABA mandates three years two in some truncated dualdegree programs.  Even if there was some magical program theres no way he got through the first part of law school in the past three years without hearing about Boumediene it would have been something hed learn about in the first  of school as Con Laws a mandatory L course.  Unless of course he didnt pay much attention which would beg the question how he established that constitutional lawyer career.  Obviously all of this is impossible he was a computer engineer just a year ago and didnt know a seminal case in his field of specialty three months ago.

1704277,0,t3_2dw8nc,Its not illogical or bad. Its not outdated either. Its exactly what world diplomacy and the justice system are about. Its logical.The reason people claim its not logical or not beneficial is because its not nice. Theres no nice way to put it that some people in this world deserves a hefty punishment. There is no nice way to get some people to change their wicked ways.Consider whats going on in Iraq. What kind of deterrence or corrective procedure could you administer to ISIS to stop them from killing people? You cant deliver anything but death and prison time for them because they will not change due to your persuasion skills. They will not change due to you giving them time to think about their crime. Many people will change their attitudes once they are lightly punished and this is exactly why we have prisons in modern society.  But there are others like ISIS of whom no amount of corrective attempts or persuasion will change. Everyone is human but not every human is the same or has the same mentality or brainwiring. For many deterrence using criminal punishments is enough to dissuade them from criminal activity. For others punishment after they commit a crime can correct their behavior. And then there are others who no amount of punishment or persuasion or corrective adjustments will work. If we could reason with everyone and convince them easily we wouldnt need wars diplomatic sensitivity in hopes of not offending the opposing party or a justice system.You cant rehabilitate everyone despite our attempts to achieve that goal.Please note I am not saying that the justice system is all about revenge.

The process invites wellsupported testimony from experts who have been recognized as experts by the court and encourages competing experts to point out flaws in each others reasoning for the benefit of the court. Hired guns can make their way into that process but its discouraged by judges and juries. And for that matter its discouraged by the parties the lawyers and the experts. All lawyers will tell you that its better to base a great argument on great facts than to base a great argument on bad facts. In cases where an expert is needed the experts testimony is often the basis for the key facts. Bad experts are only going to get you bad facts. Of course if bad facts are the only facts you have a lawyer will make do. In that case the system hopes the other sides expert tears apart the argument or the judge refuses to certify the expert or the jury picks up on it and refuses to credit the testimony. ,law,cjuavkz,3,t5_2qh9k

But this would leave out retribution which would anger the families of the victims and could cause even more violence and vigilante justice more crime.gtForced drugging isnt what youre really arguing harms the retributive function eliminating other modes of punishment is regardless of whether theres forced druggingBut that is what I was saying. That you eliminate all other forms of punishment and only drug all criminals who you find their behavior to be unacceptable and believe that the drugging will cause them to be peaceful and noncriminal.

Note that I said not that its always illegal to threaten to do something lawful but rather that its not the case that its always legal to threaten to do something lawful and I provided a specific example of when such actions are illegal namely blackmail. Thus the fact that the actions that Perry threatened were actions that he was legally allowed to take or not take arbitrarily does not automatically allow us to conclude that the threat itself was lawful. If that argument against the indictment were sound then all laws against blackmail would be invalidated by the same argument. After all if I know that you committed a crime Im legally allowed but usually not obligated to report it to the police so I should be allowed to threaten to report it unless you give me a bunch of money right?

Watkins which invalidated a Maryland statute requiring a declaration of a belief in God in order to hold a public office. Its not directly on point as the armed forces are not considered a public office but holding isnt so narrow as to apply only to public offices. gtWe repeat and again reaffirm that neither a State nor the Federal Government can constitutionally force a person to profess a belief or disbelief in any religion. Neither can constitutionally pass laws or impose requirements which aid all religions as against nonbelievers and neither can aid those religions based on a belief in the existence of God as against those religions founded on different beliefs.The fact that it is still on the books is not really of any consequence unless its exercised. There are a number of statutes state as well as federal that existed for years after they became invalidated elsewhere.

2247810,0,t3_2kuax6,I voted against TWU. I wrote my rationale in another forum by I will copy and paste here for anybody who is interestedThe covenant prohibits sexual intimacy that violates the sacredness of marriage between a man and a womanSo the discrimination is as follows a legally married homosexual couple can have sexual intimacy while a legally married homosexual couple can not. This is pure discrimination against homosexual married couples in comparison with heterosexual married couples. I ask anybody who supports TWU a hypothetical question. Would you support TWU if TWU prevented interracial couples from engaging in sexual intimacy in the name of religious freedom? Would you support TWU if it prevented womenblacksAboriginals or whatever other ethnic or religious group from attending TWU on the basis on religious freedom? And remember LGB rights are a protected group under the Charter just like those other groups I mentioned. And while I dont support TWUs Christian values my personal values are completely irrelevant to my analysis. TWU has the right to operate its University however it so chooses within the boundaries of the law. Just like any other universities in Canada. However while they have the right to operate their university however they so choose within the boundaries of the law I do not believe they have the automatic right to be an approved law school by the LSBC a self regulating organization that is granted its authority to regulate its members by the secular provincial government if TWU operates in a discriminatory manner and runs its university in a manner that is contrary to the values enshrined in the Charter. And while the Charter does not directly apply to TWU the Charter only applies to government and quasigovernment actions and actors arguably the Charter does apply to the Law Society of BC as a selfregulating organization that derives its authority to regulate its membership by Legal Profession Act an act enacted by the provincial government that delegates the governments power to regulate the profession to the LSBC.And it is important to note my vote and the other members vote does not prevent TWU from operating a university TWU from teaching its students law TWU from operating a law school TWU students that attend a hypothetical TWU law school from attempting to become lawyers in other foreign jurisdictions TWU from maintaining their community covenant Christian students from attending any of the approved other law schools in British Columbia Christian students who attended a LSBC approved law school in Canada from becoming Lawyers in BC Christian lawyers who attended law school outside of Canada and meet the various NCA requirements similar to other foreign trained lawyers from becoming lawyers in BCAll my vote and the  of other members of the Law Society who voted against TWU did was that TWU would not be an approved law school by the Law Society of BC should those potential students want to enter the BC Bar. As I mentioned before the rationale behind my decision is as follows should TWU be approved it would be easier for a straight student to become a lawyer in comparison with a homosexual student in British Columbia as there would be more available spots to straight students in comparison to homosexual students in British Columbia.And I am sure you may argue that a homosexual student could choose to not engage in sexual intimacy while attending TWU. However this argument has been rejected ad nauseum by the Courts in other settings. For example the Courts and society have rejected the argument that gay couples can choose not to get married that interracial couples can choose not to get married etc etc etc...It is discrimination against LGBTs people pure a simple. In maintaining the integrity of my profession and in considering the values of the Charter and my oath and my professions oath to uphold the rule of law and the rights and freedoms of all persons according to the law of Canada and of the Province of British Columbia it is discrimination contrary to the principles of the Charter that the LSBC and the profession should not condone.,law,clpjsjp,5,t5_2qh9k

2268919,0,t1_cls1j4k,The field of chemical engineering is indeed doing well but the practice of law regarding chemical engineering is shaky at best. The focus is on BigPharma patents so ChemE attorneys who also have a strong bio background would most likely get snatched up along with the bio and biochem attorneys. But pure chemistry or ChemE backgrounds arent as sought after without the bio emphasis.Caveat if you get your undergraduate degree in Chemical Engineering with a good GPA then get your JD with a decent GPA you will most likely land a pretty sweet BigLaw job as a patent attorney. But those are not simple feats. Second caveat YMMV. My experience as a fairly recent graduate is that  of new patent attorney job postings ask for EECS or bio backgrounds for software or pharma patents. But if you have a lot of patent attorney connections then you can probably get a job without necessarily filling one of these strictlydefined openings.

I can see where they might appear to be witnesses or to file amicus briefs or the like but actually practicing before a state court?  Im trying to think of a situation it sort of seems like there should be.   USC      and    which deal with the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court Federal District Courts Federal Court of Claims and Court of International Trade respectively have some provisions that grant exclusive original jurisdiction to federal courts either one or several over a class of cases where the US is a party but also several that just grant original jurisdiction over a class of such cases which seems to leave open the possibility of concurrent original jurisdiction particularly where the US is a plaintiff.  Intuitively it seems like McCulloch v. Maryland would preclude state power over issues involving the federal government where Congress hasnt explicitly consented to state jurisdiction over federal issues and maybe they have in certain areas Ive only briefly looked.  However if no statute prohibits jurisdiction to state courts on some issue and the federal government brings suit in state court McCulloch v. Maryland doesnt seem like it would come into play since the federal government would be consenting to state adjudication.

I would not hire or direct the PI especially not for a client who had not yet retained. Ive had numerous calls from prospective clients in this guys situation. Normally the infidelity means absolutely nothing to the court and it is really only relevant here because of the specific clause in the prenup which Ive seen in a few before.

3090204,0,t3_2vjh72,Well. . . maybe. Thats a somewhat misleading interpretation of the substance of the order.Significantly the actual order says that the groups Free Exercise affirmative defense is still live which would presumably act as a bar on all claims. The order says that whether the groups advertising constitutes a secular claim about the scientific mental health status of homosexuality or a religious claim about the groups own perspective on homosexuality is a question of fact for the jury. If a jury were to conclude the former the defendant is screwed. The judge has ruled that such statements are not permissible. But if the latter the order strongly implies that the defense would be complete and the plaintiff would lose as the courts will not act to regulate the content or expression of religious opinions.So in essence the judge has ruled that New Jerseys consumer protection laws prohibit the advertising of services by saying that the scientific community considers homosexuality to be a mental illnessdiseasedisorder because such is manifestly not the case at least not anymore. But thats it. If the defendant was expressing the religious opinion that homosexuality is disordered see e.g. the Catechism of the Catholic Church well its allowed to do that whether you like it or not. If a religious group believes that homosexuality is a mental illness knowing full well that scientific consensus disagrees and to hell with it I mean how can anyone tell them that theyre wrong? Thats what they believe and as long as theyre only making claims about what they believe they can basically say whatever they want. Consumer protection laws do not prohibit religious groups from advertising their services using nonfalsifiable statements of religious opinion.In short the judge did not rule one way or the other about whether the defendant religious group can say that homosexuality is a mental illness disease or disorder as such. Rather he ruled that the group cannot say or imply if Im reading the order correctly that homosexuality has been formally recognized by medicalpsychological groups as a mental illnessdiseasedisorder but that the group can say that they believe homosexuality to be such. He then left it up to a jury to decide whether the groups advertising is the former or the latter which he was required to do by the procedural rules.But the judge did conclusively rule that the defendant religious group cannot claim success in its conversion therapy services because it failed to introduce any evidence which would support a factual basis for the claim. The group is allowed to believe anything that it wants. But in the context of advertising services it is not allowed to make factual claims about the results of those services without an actual demonstrable basis for said claims. As a religious person myselfindependent of my views on homosexuality about which I make no claims herewho also happens to be a practicing attorney let me just say that I really think that this is the correct result. The First Amendment protects the ability of religious groups to  hold whatever beliefs they wish  publish the content of said beliefs and  advertise services provided to consumers using claims predicated on said beliefs. To say otherwise would be to completely gut any substantive concept of Free Exercise to say nothing of Freedom of Expression. But groups cannot make false factual claims about either  the opinions of others or  the results of their services. As to the former theres never been any protection for that. As to the latter as long as we recognize that a lot of claims about the results of religious services arent falsifiable at all e.g. whether youre going to heaven have been forgiven of sin etc. subjecting those claims that are falsifiable to the same scrutiny as everyone else only makes sense. ,law,coiaqmn,21,t5_2qh9k

Superfluous adjectives were eliminated.  Needlessly long or complex sentences were strongly discouragedmy professor would have deducted points for the semicolon at the beginning of this paragraph.

But if both contracting parties are aware of and agree to the contract ahead of time then it is not a valid grounds of annulment. At the least it could suggest it as being a consideration to the formation of marriage not necessarily the controlling or only one granted. Not sure how this plays out elsewhere.Although there are also considerations in child custody cases and the best interest standard that tend to suggest a marriage is preferred for children as a form of rearing placing at least some significance on marriage as a means of rearing children.,law,cpdv26c,3,t5_2qh9k

While it doesnt have immediate application to this issue that is the point I was specifically addressing. I was making the point that others may philosophically disagree with your theory of punishment so such laws shouldnt be discarded as arcane.Regarding this specific case Im not seeking retribution against the witness in this case for a committed crime. That said hes a flight risk and needs to testify. He has information essential to the disposition of the case and has willingly refused cooperation. The alternative is let him go without bond and likely never see him again.

Quite honestly I dont get why anybody with a law degree is even talking about it with respect to his confession in the bathroom.  The expectation of privacy concept is used in a th amendment analysis.  The fourth amendment among other things prevents unreasonable searches.  You can only raise a fourth amendment claim when the thing that was searched is something you have an expectation of privacy in.  For instance you have an expectation of privacy in your bedroom dresser.  So the government cant search your dresser unless they have probable cause a warrant or meet the exceptions to getting a warrant.  What does this have to do with Dursts statements?  Absolutely nothing which is why I dont get why it keeps getting mentioned by lawyers not picking on you I know you arent a lawyer and are just curious.Now as for being alone in a room with your lawyers...his statements may have been subject to the attorneyclient privilege and in THAT case there would be a question as to whether he had a reasonable expectation of privacy during his discussion.

3524169,0,t1_cpttydt,I think the death penalty is wrong so I will not disagree with you there.As for the felony murder rule I think it is a very sound doctrine. You say that in Italy a defendant must at least foresee that a death could occur for them to be held culpable. That is not very different for the felony murder rule as it only applies to inherently dangerous felonies i.e. rape arson robbery burglary kidnapping. Those are all crimes where it is foreseeable that the victim could die directly from the defendants actions or that the victim might reasonably react in such a way that could cause a death such as responding in selfdefense with a gun. Therefore the felony murder rule says that the death is foreseeable or at least it should have been foreseeable.In addition I disagree with your categorization of it as strict liability. While there are certainly strict liability crimes in the US statutory rape being the most prominent I think it is inaccurate to place felony murder in that category because the state must still prove every element of the predicate crime. For example if someone dies during a house fire and the state charges the defendant with felony murder on the basis of arson the state must prove every element of arson including intent. All that said I apologize you are being downvoted. I appreciate someone with knowledge of the Italian legal system coming in here to share. I am sure that the process was somewhat misrepresented in the US media so your clarifications are appreciated. ,law,cptzb5q,2,t5_2qh9k

Its not a political position its a legal position. They chose to join a criminal organization. They chose to commit the underlying crime that brings them to court. As such because they did not chose to act in a lawful manner they are being punished appropriately. I further drew the line at gang tats as evidencing a clear intent to join a gang I even provided that I thought the benefit of the doubt should be extended to those whose only implied affiliations were colors and location. But to you it seems getting gang tats is no clear indication of being a member. I think there is a clear legal corollary here it disincentivizes criminal activity and joining gangs by increasing the punishments of members of criminal organizations.

First there have been reports that this was a highcrime neighborhood but thats not necessarily equivalent to a heavy narcotics trafficking area. In particular this may be important due to the association between narcotics trafficking and guns which may not be present in other types of crime. Second Wardlow was holding an opaque bag not a purse or backpack which could reasonably be evidence of contraband in a narcotics trafficking neighborhood.

People have unreasonable expectations about the burden of proof in university proceedings largely because they dont understand that PoE is usually the standard in noncriminal proceedings not because they think the expulsion  reputational suffering potentially rises to the threshold of losing a protected liberty interest the liberty interest of attending that particular university which needed to accept you under their conditions in the first place.Reddit treats preponderance of the evidence like some kind of legal coup when it goes part and parcel with the majority of noncriminal proceedings.  Even if we concede that PoE is inappropriate in this single context uFerociousaurus never mentioned rape and I happen to think plagiarism is fine for PoE the best youre going to get is clear and convincing evidence and you can bet reddit would be up in arms about that too.Expulsion is bad.  People thinking youre a rapist is bad. These two things combined might be worse than a lot of things but its not jail or death. The university might have more resources at its disposal than the student but its not the prosecutorial arsenal the state has.  These are the reasons why you get reasonable doubt in criminal trials but not university tribunals not because society just happens to really really frown upon accusations of raping fellow students.They might be good reasons for raising the BoP to the exceptional level of clear and convincing evidence. I kind of think there are a lot more things faulty with university inquiries than the BoP that render them very ad hoc and arbitrary to the point of being extremely difficult to craft a meaningful defense going back to uferociousaurus point about other DP concerns.  BoP is just more accessible to the general public because weve all heard about beyond a reasonable doubt on TV.EDIT  Just realized youre not upatricksaurus and I was picking up on some of the stuff she said too.,law,cr7betj,1,t5_2qh9k

4102406,0,t1_crnqdyj,gtYoure assuming causation based on something that is barely a correlation.The biggest factor to success in our young people is wealth not skin color. And I am completely in favor of an affirmative action that is based on wealth.You are correct that wealth is the ultimate barrier. But black people suffer higher rates of poverty than white people in large part because they are black. They are being born into and growing up in neighborhoods devoid of resources and education with high crime rates that have been effectively relegated to black people. They suffer housing credit and employment discrimination. That happens in almost every big city in America. In the South it is even worse. Black people struggle to become wealthy because of longstanding policies that both intentionally and accidentally target people with black skin. Affirmative action helps stem that problem by putting higher proportions of black people in the upper echelons of society so that people with political power will happen to care about what is happening to those black communities. That solution wont happen if you just help poor people the majority of which would be white and would have no care for what is going on in ghettos and the South.,law,crnwe3d,2,t5_2qh9k

In real life no officer discharges their weapon aiming only for an offenders knee or intends to cowboy it amp shoot a weapon out of someones hand but the public doesnt react well when an officer is justified yet unloads several clips and riddles the offender with bullets.  When lessthanlethal arms come into play thats difficult.

4395136,0,t1_csky7zv,I dont think that AB to ABC is necessarily so clear. The drafters wrote the term liberty which is a vague and pretty openended term.Other commenters have done a great job of explaining originalism and the concept of the living constitution so I wont go back over it. But even from the perspective of Originalism figuring out what legislatorsdrafters meant by liberty is not an easy task. Thats why the courts have established an analytical framework with which to interpret those kinds of terms in the constitution e.g. free speech due process cruel and unusual freedom of religion terms not to mention the nd amendment. Its even harder when you take into account that the drafters were aware that they were choosing vague terms.Next you dont have to wait and pose hypotheticals to see where the SC might one day use this interpretive power to the detriment of people. Just look at cases like Lochner where legislation protecting workers was struck down in order to protect the liberty to contract or right to work. In that case the judges felt that legislation protecting bakers correct me if Im wrong from unsafe conditionshours infringed on the right for bakers to contract for work as they saw fit. Thats akin to saying that the minimum wage infringes on peoples right to willingly work for a lower wage maybe they really need a job.

Arguably he was simply acknolwedging the practical import that a jury could nullify the law by finding the facts do not fall within the applicable legal standard. Regardless the common law is not made and settled by any one judge but many judges concurring over time. Since Jay was on the bench we have very clear standards for courts to set aside jury verdicts. The fact that courts can do so is a clear indication that jurors are not permitted to nullify the law. In almost all instances of nullification the standard for ordering a new trial are readily met. If the standard for a new trial is not met i.e. a reasonable person could conclude as the jury did then arguably no nullification has occurred because the jurors have the authority to weigh the evidence to conclude that in fact the prosecutorplaintiff has not met her burden of proof. ,law,ctrehze,1,t5_2qh9k

Ive had law firms though demand that people follow a rigid schedule or take a certain amount of break time or even work no more than X hours per day.  Often this serves to check off a box in someones imagination about what maximizes their review hours and sometimes its because the firm has committed to provide coverage only during certain hours.  I had one matter where we couldt start early or work late because the software vendor did maintenance and reporting at a set time each day and any users in the system would create problems.Theres a lot to be said for how one delivers that sort of information to the team though.I had to fight for the ability of people to keep their cell phones on a recent project.

Federal judges are often career civil servants appointed by someone with experience in the legal system presidents tend to be former lawyers often at the recommendation of experts in the field. While there may be some problems with lack of democratic accountability other pieces in the political system including a democratically elected legislature balance that out.Some of the same reasons we allow judges to be insulated from direct elections make sense for prosecutors as well. There can be a lot of pressure to charge people with crimes that grip the public consciousness even if those charges would do little to further community safety. Prosecutors sometimes bring charges against highprofile defendants in hopes to further ambitions for higher elected office think of prosecutors who charge minors as child pornographers for sending pictures of themselves or prosecutors blaming Craigslist for facilitating prostitution Perhaps some of these cases are warranted but it certainly seems like these are actions calculated to boost electoral support rather than effectively safeguard the community.Direct elections are not a magic bullet for functioning of the legal system.

The first is mapping conditions where as a condition of bond individuals are banned from certain areas usually people with drug charges are banned from areas where drugs are often sold.  The other is certain state laws that have elevated punishments for selling drugs within a certain distance of special areas schools churches parks etc..  The problem is everyone wants their neighborhood to be covered under these protections so you end up with a situation where everything is the aggravated punishment and theres no real deterrence because theres nowhere else for them to go.

5281464,0,t3_3ncbvp,TLDR This actually raises some fairly interesting implications of the legalization of medical marijuana i.e. can a testator who is completely baked be said to be of sound mind? Because if the answer is No palliative care involving pot just got a lot more problematic.For starters the question here is not the propriety of bequests for the benefit of animals. Those are a little unusual but most states will enforce such bequests as written with a few exceptions which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. They were an oddity a few decades ago maybe but now theyre viewed as pretty unexceptional by the estate bar.No whats happening here is that while Simons will essentially bequeathed his dog to a particular couple it does not appear to have included a financial bequest for the devisees expenses related to the care of the animal. While the alleged  in annual expenses is arguably a bit excessive the fact that no financial bequest was made is a little unusual. If that were the only oddity with the will this probably wouldnt be news or at least not big news. But it also appears that numerous animal welfare charities that received annual support from Simon during his life were not provided for either. Thats also unusual. Most testators who make regular annual gifts to specific charities generally tend to include bequests in favor of those charities in their wills. The fact that Simon does not appear to have done that makes the claim about the dog a little more plausible. The whole claim is that Simon was not in is right mind when he made out his last will. The fact that there are all of these unusual omissions lends some credibility to that notion as does the fact that he was apparently stoned out of his gourd on medical marijuana during the time period when the will was apparently executed. That may well be the buried lede here. The validity of any will is predicated on the testator being of sound mind. That means two things. First it requires that the testator is not subject to any duress coercion or other form of undue influence. You hear stories about the golddigging caretaker or trophy wife getting the ancient wealthy patron to change his will at the last minute? The question there is whether the testator was subject to undue influence in changing his will. But second it also requires that the testator be sufficiently mentally aware for the bequests in the will to be recognized as the result of rational considered deliberate intention rather than the product of a brain addled by age illness orand in this case most importantlypsychoactive substances. A cancer patient who changes his will through a haze of morphine would cast the validity of the will into question. So it turns out might a cancer patient who changes his will through a haze of pot.Now the trustees for Simons estate counter that theyre just doing what Simons will dictates and that the people making the claim about the dog are just being selfish assholes. All of that is as may be and the asshole claim also has a certain credibility to it. But theres no denying that something distinctly odd is going on here. Itll be interesting to see how this one plays out. I think itll ultimately come down to a question of fact. There isnt going to be any way that a judge is going to rule that someone smoking pot must be of sound mind as a matter of law but theres no way hes going to rule that Simon wasnt of sound mind as a matter of law either. Even patients hopped up on painkillers can be of sound mind if theres sufficient evidence. So this is probably going to turn on whether the evidence as a whole suggests that Simon knew what he was doing. The oddities in the will call that into question but itll take more than that to decide the case.,law,cvmrojy,12,t5_2qh9k

5390170,0,t3_3ouywe,Eh. Look Im an attorney. I do both plaintiffside and defenseside work. I try to stay out of bodily injury cases simply because I dont like the work involved but I completely get that sometimes legitimate cases can nonetheless have bad optics. Still not entirely sure thats what was going on here. Yes I get that the plaintiff really only cared about the homeowners insurance and I get that insurance carriers cant be sued directly not being the real party in interest after all. But she still chose to bring a suit against family and more than family an eight yearold kid for doing what all of the stories Ive read on the subject suggest was exactly what everyone expects eightyear old kids to do. The reaction here is based upon the intuitionwhich the PI plaintiffs bar is rather loath to acknowledgethat there are injuries which are no ones fault and for which no compensation is or ought to be available. Liability insurance exists to protect insureds from meritorious claims. It does not exist to guarantee that anybody who wants to can get money every time they are injured even if its nobodys fault no matter what PI plaintiffs attorneys have to say. If there could be a clearer example of motivated reasoning Im not sure what it would be.Further the author seems to be implying that But he had insurance! is an argument that can transform a frivolous claim into a meritorious one. Hes wrong about that. Indeed this is why the rules of evidence specifically prohibit the existence or nature of a defendants insurance policies from being admitted as evidence except under very rare circumstances e.g. Theres a question about ownership or control of an activity or property. Its exceptionally unusual to procure insurance for things one doesnt owncontrol. And arguments like the one being made here are textbookgrade illustrations of why that rule exists. In short whether or not a defendant has insurance has nothing whatsoever to do with whether a plaintiff deserves to get paid. ,law,cw0nkxm,92,t5_2qh9k

I have worked in two California offices.  My first one was v biglaw. I billed about  hours on average a year for . years.  I found a partner whose work style I gelled with  they worked remotely most Mondays and Fridays and valued her spare time so we had a  am   pm work schedule and then had our weekends free.  I worked holidays etc. when necessary but not as a matter of course.  I exercised and dated plenty.  It helped that I was good friends with my fellow associates.  Other associates worked more of a between  and some on the weekends and were in a better political position than I was.New job is at a more regional firm just outside the amlaw .  It has high profile work and is a top firm in its secondary city but has limited brand value elsewhere.  My bonuses are laughable and im about k below market but because i lived really cheaply at my first job my loans are done.   My hours target is  half of the firm doesnt hit it and if i hit k im a hero.  Everyone has left the office by about  pm.So my point is that you will be much happier and freeer once your loans are done.  What I suggest to you is that you live as frugally as humanly possible and concentrate on killing your loans and maybe getting a nest egg to move back to home town and buy a house there if thats what you want to do.  But you can do biglaw somewhere else without it making you this miserable so lateral.  Theres a really hot lateral market right now especially as you enter into your third year.

In legal terms what is the risk that the sports participant has assumed. A football player understands he will get tackled in the course of a game a golfer should not be getting tackled. More concretely in a baseball game if a pitcher hits a batter in the face with a pitch even if its intentional thats going to be considered part of the game and it wont lead to civil liability. When a pitcher throws at the ondeck batter whos not paying attention that will give rise to liability.You can play lawschool professor and think up a hypothetical that really blurs the line between whats part of the game and what isnt but thats the general framework.,law,cytmkzk,1,t5_2qh9k

Id be first in line to say that both groups are assholes worthy of all the contempt disdain and ridicule we can muster for them. But I would also be first in line to defend the right of those groupsor any groupsto say whatever they like other than incitement sedition defamation solicitation etc.. I say again the only reason to use the term hate speech is to say explicitly or implicitly that the speaker ought not be allowed to say those things.

I hope you find this advice useful. It is highly possible that the admissions officer knows little to nothing about what services are available for students with disabilities. What you interpreted as an attitude on the admission advisers part may have been due to ignorance rather than animosity. Check the websites for the schools youre thinking of attending and look up the contact information about the disabled student services office. They can tell you what administrative and educational accommodations are available to students at the school.  The other place you can go for assistance is your states vocational rehabilitation agency.  Every state has one and their purpose is to provide the additional supports that people with disabilities need when attempting to go to work or obtain the skills needed to be a productive worker. You can find the website address for your states vocational rehabilitation here  These agencies can help students with disabilities with tuition books travel etc. they can also help you get a job after you finish your education. Getting services can take time. getting a degree with a significant disability is a challenge. Youll likely not get everything you want from the school or State VR Agency but if youre determined and patient youll likely get what you need. Good luck to you,law,d1vxqj1,1,t5_2qh9k

7463840,0,t1_d2qijdv,gt When you are an individual renting out your own home you arent infringing on anyone elses rights. Given the amount of control Airbnb has over what gets listed who it gets listed to and the fact that many people depend on Airbnb for their livelihood it is not as straightforward as a landlordtenant relationship.  Like the arguments often made by Uber drivers it is more like an employee or independent contractor relationship between the property owner and Airbnb.Also it is no secret that the main reason a lot of property owners use Airbnb is because the service encourages its users to create profiles to build their reputation.  These profiles make it really easy for property owners to discriminate on the basis of sex religion and race.  I know plenty of owners using Airbnb who casually admit to selection criteria that would get me in trouble with the local fair housing authority.   gt You could instead say that they are eating into your profits because short term leasing is narrowing the pool of potential tenants for your building. It doesnt impact me at all.  If anything it gives me options I never had before.  So for example the Super Bowl is coming to Houston.  I have a  unit complex in a prime location to the stadium.  It is tempting to evict my tenants and list the units on Airbnb.  I could easily charge more than a months rent pert night.  I know all the other landlords around me are thinking the same thing.

7691442,0,t1_d3ekpvs,I dont like spaghetti posting so Im just going to pull this out as what I think best encapsulates what youve said here. If Im wrong you can point me back to it again. vgt I am strongly against the FBI on that case and I truly believe anyone who isnt is at worst malicious or stupid at best ignorant Id like to hear a good argument for what the FBI is doing. Like the Google vs. Oracle case I wouldnt say this is a culture war but I would definitely say that culture played and is playing a big part in the events that transpired.I think that the FBI had the better argument in the FBIApple case and would probably have won on the merits eventually. The simplest way to explain why is because Apples argument is ultimately narrow. It focuses on a very specific set of capabilityrelated arguments that are only of marginal legal relevance but more than that are pretty misleading when it comes to actually describing the societal balancing act in play.This is what I mean when I say culture war is probably the wrong way to think about it. When I think of a culture war I think of two sides fighting on a single battlefield over cultural merits things like being pro or anti abortion. The problem is that I think this particular conflict  if you can call it that  exists on two separate levels entirely. Technologists I wish there was a better word here basically just go and do what they want theyre guided by capability and some kind of libertarian capitalist ethic. The legal system exists on a separate track and eventually it either clobbers them or accepts them. The technologists dont really participate on the legal level except in a very transactional sense and the legal system basically ignores the inner workings of the technologist class.Ubers a pretty good example of this IMHO. Uber has never engaged with the legal system on its own terms. It enters markets without complying with the law issues ultimatums occasionally gets into transactional legal fights and if it loses just withdraws from the market. Theres no attempt to engage in a long running legal or political battle its victories in these arenas often come despite its behavior.Thats what Im seeing in the OracleGoogle fight. The testimony of the Googlers as described is precisely this no real attempt to really engage on the legalpolitical front and barely an acknowledgement that it exists.

So far so good.But because the decision is often made by Ls which city which firm and which practice area to aim for everyone else competing for that same talent pool good students from good schools has to match even if it doesnt make any underlying business sense for that particular firm or office or practice area.Once you start to see high junior associate salaries as another effect rather than a root cause of the legal professions woes then this article makes less sense.

Amazon will reap the rewards in the long term from the lack of competitors.

You have to fairly test the test takers knowledge and be able to separate the pool of test takers into a broad range of scores that accurately reflect their mastery of the material. That means a good range of difficulty in questions where the hardest questions tend to be answered correctly by the most knowledgeable test takers instead of a question that tricks a certain group of testers into the right or wrong answer untethered from their actual ability. The testing agency also must keep those questions under wraps until the test day and then never use them again.So it just makes sense for almost all the states to jointly develop questions instead of each state to make their own.

Do you really want your disciplinary board asking one of your prospective clients Yes but how did heshe say it?The implication in uIndenturedsavants statement is that a woman calling a man sweetie or darlin is implicitly different from the reverse.And thats horseshit. Sometimes its different. Sometimes words mean all kinds of things sometimes a person can say sir or maam and mean something terrible but no one is asking for anyones license over that. Why? Because its ridiculous. Either were making a judgment based on whats actually said or not.This implication asks us to make a distinction here and not just that but an especially repugnant one that this behavior is okay for one sex but not for the other. Isnt that the entire reason this is an issue in the first place?It isnt inherently different for a woman to call a man a derogatory sexual term than the other way around.

9557715,0,t3_5bqdgp,For the record theres no reason to think Eramo is going to have any trouble collecting here either the  million judgment against Rolling Stone or the  million judgment against Erdely. Two reasons.First Rolling Stone has insurance. I havent seen the actual declarations page but its a major media outlet that is going to treat insurance as simply a cost of doing business. That insurance is going to include a primary CGL policy with limits of at least  million per incident and likely an excess policy with limits of  million or more. The policy will almost certainly cover both the magazine itself as well as any reporters writing for the magazine employees or otherwise and coverage under Rolling Stones policy really ought to be extended as part of the reporters contracts.Second depending on the nature of the contract between Erdely and Rolling Stone the latter may well be subject to vicarious liability for Erdelys conduct done within the course and scope of her contract. Shes probably not a straight employee so whether theres straightup respondeat superior liability is a good question. But shes almost certainly going to be considered an agent of the magazine and principals are liable for the actions of their agents when acting within the course and scope of that agency which Erdely unquestionably was in writing the article. So insurance and contractual indemnification aside Eramo could seek to collect the judgment directly from Rolling Stone whether the magazine is okay with that or not.All of that said the most likely outcome is for the parties to settle for something less than  millionthough likely not much lessin exchange for the defendants agreeing not to appeal.,law,d9r6nph,3,t5_2qh9k

I can think of two really easy solutions to this Just assume the cops testimony is adverse. In fact let the defense attorney just put whatever he wants into the official record. Any defendants can use it in any criminal trials or and plaintiffs can use it in any lawsuits against the state.  Arrest the cop for contempt of court and toss him in jail until he testifies. Just issue a bench warrant or whatever.

To a nonlawyer juror who has been shielded from preliminary discussions on evidence admission may not be able to understand why something was objectionable. Most lawyers dont angrily shout OBJECTION since that would send the wrong signal and would be needlessly unprofessional. Furthermore TV plays down the negative potential impact that doing our saying something objectionable could have on your case. On TV things get heated a few objections are made the lawyer gathers her thoughts and calmly moved on. In real life if you get dinged on the same thing more than once the judge might excuse the jury in order to ask you what the hell you dont understand about the rules of evidence or his very specific earlier ruling on THIS evidence. Bottom line there are better ways to get a point across. Juries are told repeatedly that they are only to consider the evidence before them and that there are very good reasons for keeping some evidence out.

Similarly would a white American whose parents and wife were born in South Africa be categorized as AfricanAmerican? If not wouldnt this be discriminatory against AfricanAmericans?Honestly the real issue with identifying people of color by their presumed country or continent of origin is that it entirely ignores how racebased oppression works in the first place. Black is black brown is brown and white is white regardless of specific knowledge of ancestral origin. Another big thing that bugs me in the wording of that requirement is that Hispanic literally refers to any Spanish speaking countrywhich includes Spain. What they meant was LatinLatinoLatinx.

If the cops didnt look into a particular kind of evidence maybe its because they suspected itd contain Brady material and didnt want to know about it!Im not even half joking here. I think this particular species of evidence is far enough out there that an argument like the above might not get very far at least not yet! but I wouldnt hesitate for a second to use it for more obvious categories of evidence. Absence of evidence may not be evidence of absence but it can certainly be used to cross the threshold into reasonable doubt i.e. If he really did do it wouldnt we expect see evidence of X Y and Z all of which is conspicuously absent? Whats up with that anyway?This isnt as abusive or unreasonable as it sounds at first glance either. Police and law enforcement generally are far better positioned to come up with evidence in general and certain kinds of evidence in particular. Take surveillance footage. Many security systems only keep footage for  days or so. Its not at all uncommon for criminal charges to take a month or so after the alleged crime to be formally filed. During that time the prosecutor can issue subpoenas or swear out warrants but even the shamefully limited discovery tools available to criminal defendants arent available until charges are filed. So in practical terms unless the police take steps to identify and secure surveillance footage right away its very often the case that the footage is long gone by the time the defendant even knows he might need to get it. Meaning if the police dont look for it its not unreasonable for defense counsel to bring that up. Etc.,law,ddg15ue,5,t5_2qh9k

Because this sounds ridiculous as reported.edit  Found it.The employment contract predictably has a pay or play clause.  TBI performs all of its obligations under the contract simply by paying Tomi.  It looks like her main goal is to rescind the contract and work somewhere else  something which the exclusivity agreement wont allow her to do right now.  Its a smart move overall because the quicker she can get out there into media again and capitalize on recent events and stay relevant the better for her.

11652873,0,t1_dggpffd,You make a good point about how black vs. white drug addiction was treated Sam Quinoness seminal book Dreamland had a section towards the end where he noted the shift from the hardcore tough on crime approach towards drug users by legislators happened right around the time when the junkies stopped being just black kids from the inner city and started being white kids from the upper middle class suburbs. Its one of those things where Im glad the change was made away from over incarceration to treatment but I still think its kind of shitty that we didnt think kids doing drugs and dying was a health problem until we realized that they were white kids.But its wrong to separate that from the negative impacts of globalization. The diseases of despair are a direct result of the hollowing out of the middle class in these parts of the country you cant separate them from the declining middle class that globalization had caused and frankly its inaccurate for you try to peg the start of it as being NAFTA or CAFTA even though Trump did spend too much time focusing on those deals IMHO. Scientists have tracked the rise in opioid addiction and it dovetails almost exactly with the decline in middle class jobs not just coal but manufacturing factory work etc. that were available to people with less than college education. They also tracked how the disability system is playing into it with disability essentially becoming a basic income replacement for people who have essentially been discarded by the globalists as being not useful or not productive this in turn also ties back to the opioid dependency since a lot of times people qualified for disability because of back pain or other injuries that are treated with massive amounts of opioids.Trying to pretend like globalization didnt contribute a lot to these crises isnt really workable few economists and scientists would accept that even the ones who support free trade acknowledge that even if society as a whole benefits slightly with cheaper prices the people who are driven out of work and left to rot end up being decimated and thats what weve seen time and time again.,law,dggv8sb,1,t5_2qh9k

11685308,0,t1_dgkg28f,Breyer asked precisely this in oral arguments. He said that clearly enought time could pass to make reauthorization unconstitutional. One side was arguing that enough time had passed one side was arguing that not enough time had passed and he wanted to know what they thought was the right standard of too much time.Scalia kinda took this up and he pointed out that the declining vote margins and the name argued that the court should step in. He argued that orignally  opposed then fewer then fewer then fewer and then the most recent was  which he argued was because no one could oppose it even if they opposed it. Ironically the a strong textualist and defender of respecting the voting will points out the paralysis of democracy and how strong support for legislation means that it is a question that could require the courts interventionI wouldnt have minded this analysis so much if he had brought this up in Lawrence. Yet there the legislature refusing to take up an issue due to overwhelming popularity was evidence that the court should stay out of it. So popularity in the US senate means senators are paralyzed and could never vote against Voting Rights Act and therefore require the assistance of the courts snickering and voting to retain the states criminalization of homosexual acts was the evidence of the peoples will and an invitation to Texass homosexuals to argue in the court of public opinion.However this point does make some traction. The majority points out gt Our decision in no way affects the permanent nationwide ban on racial discrimination in voting found in . We issue no holding on  itself only on the coverage formula. Congress may draft another formula based on current conditions. IE if theres near universal support for this surely that  majority who reauthorized the formula for  years could quickly write down a new one. This is monumental legislation and its very disappointing that Congress did not update the preclearance formula. edit from oyez  in breyer asksgt We have  years or perhaps of slavery.We have  years or so of legal segregation.We have had  years of this statute.And this statute has helped a lot.So therefore Congress in  looks back and says dont change horses in the middle of the stream because we still have a ways to go. Now the question is is it rational to do that?And people could differ on that.And one thing to say is of course this is aimed at States.What do you think the Civil War was about?Of course it was aimed at treating some States differently than others.And at some point that historical and practical sunsetno sunset renew what worked type of justification runs out.And the question I think is has it run out now?And now you tell me when does it run out?What is the standard for when it runs out?Never?Thats something you have heard people worried about.Does it never run out?Or does it run out but not yet?Or do we have a clear case where at least it doesnt run out now?Now I would like you to address that.from oyez  mins in for scalias questiongt Well maybe it was making that judgment Mr. Verrilli.But thats  thats a problem that I have.This Court doesnt like to get involved in  in racial questions such as this one.Its something that can be left  left to Congress.The problem here however is suggested by the comment I made earlier that the initial enactment of this legislation in a  in a time when the need for it was so much more abundantly clear was  in the Senate there  it was doubledigits against it.And that was only a year term.Then it is reenacted  years later again for a year term.Doubledigits against it in the Senate.Then it was reenacted for  years.Single digits against it.Then enacted for  years  Senate votes against it.And this last enactment not a single vote in the Senate against it.And the House is pretty much the same.Now I dont think thats attributable to the fact that it is so much clearer now that we need this.I think it is attributable very likely attributable to a phenomenon that is called perpetuation of racial entitlement.Its been written about.Whenever a society adopts racial entitlements it is very difficult to get out of them through the normal political processes.I dont think there is anything to be gained by any Senator to vote against continuation of this act.And I am fairly confident it will be reenacted in perpetuity unless  unless a court can say it does not comport with the Constitution.You have to show when you are treating different States differently that theres a good reason for it.Thats the  thats the concern that those of us who  who have some questions about this statute have.Its  its a concern that this is not the kind of a question you can leave to Congress.There are certain districts in the House that are black districts by law just about now.And even the Virginia Senators they have no interest in voting against this.The State government is not their government and they are going to lose  they are going to lose votes if they do not reenact the Voting Rights Act.Even the name of it is wonderful The Voting Rights Act.Who is going to vote against that in the future?,law,dgkjpf7,5,t5_2qh9k
