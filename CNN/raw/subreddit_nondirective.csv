4586657,0,t1_ct8ox57,I think that another part of it is that it seems that several of the instructions that Ive viewed seem to go by the view that you hear the mantra spoken to you. NSR has an MP of the mantra. Surya Ram has DVD instruction so that you hear the mantra. TM and I assume Acem have instructors that speak the mantra to you. I think this is an attempt to remove some of the interference that you get from seeing a word visually and translating it into sound. Letters represent sound not the other way around. So I personally am not sure if reading the TM mantras would be as effective. This is my own speculation. Maybe if you speak the chosen mantra to yourself and then slowly make your voice quieter and quieter until youre only speaking it into your head. If you can get your mantra checked I think thats the best thing. If not then do as you wish as long as you keep in mind what youve already pointed out that there is always the risk of searching for a sexier mantra and thereby never being settled.,nondirective,ct8qwei,1,t5_32b9b
5557526,0,t1_cwlu1tv,Given your clear and specific history of proselytizing TM and adding adversarial information into conversations about meditation styles that are not officially TM your comments do not read to me as mere disagreement but appear to be a blatant attempt at propaganda. If thats not the case let me know but I can only go by my interactions with you and your demonstrated history.I dont like censorship but more so I dont want this subreddit to become full of distracting and confusing arguments. Id love it if you were part of the conversation here. You post some interesting links over at rtranscendental and you provide some insightful comments. Yet as far as I can tell its all tinted with this apparent fixation on TM as the one true meditation with no openness for other styles and thats disappointing.,nondirective,cwlyncr,3,t5_32b9b

Your view is not one that is held by the majority of people who meditate so its important to make it clear from the onset of your argumentation. ,nondirective,d2eub2p,1,t5_32b9b
8302076,0,t1_d5db7lz,It can feel like trying at first and thats OK. It doesnt ruin it. Maybe think of it this way it can take some minor effort to start meditating and to settle down but see it like youre gently placing a flower onto a pool of water and then just letting go to watch it float. Youre sitting yourself down youre noticing your minds movement and your bodys feelings and then just like gently letting go of that flower to float on the pond you release effort and just relax. Its not relaxing into sleep but relaxing into the natural awareness that is always present. ,nondirective,d5fbfll,1,t5_32b9b
