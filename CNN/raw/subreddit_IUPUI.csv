4784489,0,t3_3gexfw,I remember reading somewhere that only HTTP and HTTPS traffic was being allowed i.e. port  and . An Access Control List ACL for students similar to the one used for the campus border filter has been placed on the wireless controllers. Web browsing and access to all IU resources is available by default faculty and staff retain full wireless access and are not limited by the student ACL.,IUPUI,ctxmia3,1,t5_2srjy

You might think that is not that hard but it is because the MATH department sucks there. IUPUI is easier academic wise and I would start off there and transfer to Purdue later if you want to go there. I transferred from Purdue to IUPUI and it was the best desecion ive made,IUPUI,dbmxmq6,3,t5_2srjy
