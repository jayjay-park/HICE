4197404,0,t1_cryoyj3,I get the feeling that the Sunhawks Wings were as much a product of Welexis skill and knowledge as his power with his domain. Gael mentioned that he studied birds for a long long time to get it right and needed to collaborate with similarlyinterested parties using various other domains.If it can steal your fame though... how does that work? Can it make peoples adoration of a dead figure continue to channel fame?Heres a thought What if on the kings deathbed a man in a cloak with an undeniable Harbinger artifact approached King Laith and convinced him to stick his hand into a hexagonal socket...,ShadowsOfTheLimelight,cryp7jv,4,t5_3782b
4280644,0,t3_39zjho,In the Game of Thrones  Shadows of the Limelight crossover yes Cersei gets more powerful with every scandal. She was already extremely powerful though given that she was Queen. Shes known by everyone in the Seven Kingdoms and probably the Free Cities as well. Pretty much any event that happens to her is going to increase her fame at least temporarily so long as its known to the people of the world.Public punishment still happens people are still put in stocks and pelted with rotten vegetables. For the most part the effect isnt strong enough that this has an appreciable impact. If the whole city is coming together to take part in the shaming thats a different story but this is one of those cases where fame begets fame. SochJun was a minor figure in the algalifs court prior to his arrest for sodomy but as the scandal spread throughout Maskoy he became far more famous to the point where he was granted a pardon. There were hundreds of men and women arrested for similar crimes who got no fame from it though because it concerned only those close to them.When it comes to those classed as outright villains like Zerstor Sanguin or Boletus there are some efforts made to keep their fame from spreading though as alluded to in the first chapter these efforts arent particularly successful for a number of reasons. In some polities such as the Kingdom of Farelin the entire business of law and order is done in secret there are secret police secret investigations and when youre taken in for a crime the entire trial is carried out in secret. A cynic might say that this is more about broader aspects of maintaining control than strict regulation of fame.,ShadowsOfTheLimelight,cs85bq0,8,t5_3782b

5159872,0,t1_cv55eb7,I definitely thought that Welexis betrayal was the climax of the first half of the story when I first read it and I was pretty surprised to find out that there was only a few chapters left. The timeskip afterwards actually somewhat reinforces that as being the midpoint of the story but with the second half mostly just being skimmed over.,ShadowsOfTheLimelight,cv7yfyw,1,t5_3782b
