2092580,0,t1_cl5ra2o,Theyre pretty close. You cant physically grab another player unless youre the Snitch but theyre not too far off especially at the highly competitive events.,Quidditch,cl5ta5c,1,t5_2rd3m

4437361,0,t3_3bvlwu,A mouth guard will offer significant protection from concussion.  In a game where people will have a pretty decent chance of clashing heads from time to time it should be mandatory. ,Quidditch,csq0j3b,-4,t5_2rd3m
6712133,0,t3_47g2ey,I was once redcarded for what I believed was a completely legal hit. I was playing defense in my own zone and a player on the other team passed the ball to their teammate near my zone. The pass was lob. I could have easily clobbered the guy before the ball got to him but I timed my steps so I got there the moment he got possession of the ball. I hit him square in the chest with a onearmed tackle and he went to the ground. The ref blew the whistle and play stopped. I thought there was an infraction elsewhere on the pitch but I was shown a red card and I couldnt believe it. I should mention that although I am bug guy the other guy was not giving up much at all. I would have been much more upset if it were a competitive match for my club. ,Quidditch,d0dlbph,1,t5_2rd3m
