6245717,0,t1_cyz6kgd,Yes! It was amazing! We walked through the rainforest for  hours and then we got to the amahoro group. It had two silverbacks and six babys and a total of gorillas. The first gorilla we saw was te second silverback not the boss. We were taking pictures  meters away and suddenly it stood up and walked toward my boyfriend and pushed him to the side! Not aggressive he was just in the way and my bf had not enough time to step aside. Then we walked a bit further a bit shaky ofcource and we got in the middle of the group. We were told to keep a distance but the gorillas dont know this rule ofcource so they got pretty close! It was amazing! They are so relaxed and humanlike! They eat and lay down an look at you and the babys were playing. We were there for an hour and then the big silverback walked away with the females behind him. We were ready to go when we heard screams in the distance and the two silverbacks came running towards us and started fighting right in front of us! No danger to us but still scary and amazing. It was the most special thing I ever saw and you should put it on top of your bucket list!,GorillaReddit,cyzkjfj,2,t5_34oxz
