11690642,0,t3_65szgg,I would say neither. If your objective is to have a small Android tablet the FNF iFive Mini S is better value IMO. Its gone as low as  I paid  but is still well worth the money and IMO a better choice than the iWork or Teclast tablets in their price range assuming you dont care for Windows.,chinapcs,dgl5hnl,1,t5_3i966
