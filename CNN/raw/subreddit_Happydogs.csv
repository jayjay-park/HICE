9972219,0,t1_db7ai1p,The dog equivalent of a human smile is open mouthed with a loose tongue It is pretty hard to distinguish for sure by facial features alone. In order to determine whether a dog is happy look at the way they hold their tails their ears even stance. Now that you ask I cant say for sure.  On the other hand Huskies were specifically bred to mush pulling loads for long distances this is the work they were born to do and they love it. Few Huskies in America are so lucky!Dont worry I give them plenty of water and have actually developed a misting system for my land vehicles! Check it out ,Happydogs,db7eo0w,2,t5_2yedk
