825264,0,t1_cgxysug,I was part of a pretty large village at the beginning of this world. We lasted  months maybe. A few of them still play but personally I couldnt keep up. It requires a huge amount of dedication to get your stats up. I know people who were setting alarms to make sure they could swap out curiosities at the right times they had  characters all raising different stats. I tried to just play one character and then by the time I realised I wouldnt survive with just  it was too late for me to catch up so I just quit. Ill probably try and do it properly next world because Ill be starting out with the same people and I can plan better. Unless they make some huge changes to the game it will always fizzle out quickly just based on how it works. If you get one village of people who kill a lot but never die themselves theyll be on top and youll never ever be able to catch them. ,Hearthlings,cgy31ar,3,t5_2sddo
