9045102,0,t1_d7ytahf,At the beginning it would take me mins too. Im not trying to brag with my times they are not even flawless.. my point is that I dont like when people recommend bad skills that are not even necessary. A weapon skill is not something you just change you need to choose the right one because you will be using it for a LONG time. Of course not everybody will be able to clear it when they hit  thats fine. Energy is still not going to make you better you will become better by playing it over many times. You can put  points into counter healing and that will be even better and wth? you can even regen by standing still or kiting a mob end of a wave. Energy massacre or whatever these are not good. Now that is my opinion and if you want to go ahead and use them I dont care Im just saying that they are bad. ,hitmobile,d7z2rnv,1,t5_3fbvs

Do they really suck that bad that they have to cheat in PvP? They can go ahead and cheat on adventure solo and gear their char easily but they should manup grow some balls and play fair on PvP or they nothing but a failure. Even if that game screen says win they never did it with skill and ability they did it with an unfair advantage so in reality they are nothing but a loser.

10196227,0,t1_dbzoki9,Yea its for sure a liability. Theres a pinned S recommendation thread at the top of this subreddit if you want GW recommendations. Those are all based on competitive Korean players.The only class that is viable with S is Kiki if theyve got enhanced Rupture. Everyone else should aim for S without exception or really any room for argument. Some classes require slightly different playstyles to adjust for S but a correctly played S skillset is more or less always better than a correctly played S one.Star isnt very powerful against top players because it allows for reaction. I could stand still and let Lenas use star at me and it would never connect if Im expecting it because Ill use a skill when I notice her dashing in. Rampage is instant and scary because theres no counterplay you can only try to be move unpredictably and do your best to bait a poorly aimed one.As a side note because I notice most people dont realize this the biggest offensive stat is CD reduction.,hitmobile,dbzsrc8,1,t5_3fbvs

It would be better to have revive than not to have revive but you have to consider what youre trading for it. Why is it deemed a PVE set? because it gives the most CP of any set. Crit resist is useless in PVE CD Reduction is a utility stat better for PVP though not useless in PVE and pc PVP specific bonuses are useless in PVE.

10899855,0,t3_5vrkho,Bit too many questions for me to answer right now but pets work by simply adding their stats to your own.  The catch is that you need to equip them with their own gear and they only benefit from a set percentage of that gear which is noted by the s you see on the pet.  So a pet with  weapon transfer will get  of the equipped weapon and so you will get  of that equipped weapon.  TLDR Pets dont do any combat they just hold extra gear slots for you and give you the stats at a reduced rate.Please check out the FAQ in the meantime while someone else helps answer your questions.,hitmobile,de48qu6,1,t5_3fbvs

10937276,0,t3_5w4oky,Yes they work to reduce damage in PVP also. But it does not affect skill damage. It only reduces normal attack damage. It may give you a higher survivability rate but it is only useful in harder PvE stages imo. Better to put the skill points into other things since most people dont use normal attack too often in PvP.,hitmobile,de83qer,-1,t5_3fbvs

For  reasonsampnbsp I DONT REALLY WANT TO GET HIT lol. but if you dont get hit you dont take advantage of the awakening..  Here I was thinking hey  crit rate loss thats  fusion topaz versus crit damage not even  thats less than  fusion emerald. Stats wise it favors weapon  too. But hey I burned k gems without ever getting  emerald slots. Lol. Would have been better with weapon   emerald  topaz and max out my crit rate passive to get .ampnbspBottom line is there anyway to change Awakening type? Like myb when they patch bigtime?

I havent spent a penny on this game and play just little over a month and could do end game content. If you are playing Lena just focus on your CP and save your gem for costumepetaccessory. I would get one simple pet then aim for costume to up your CPSP the most important is unlock every alt and just auto play them while you doing something else.
