And my closest friends especially the ones without children still think kids are weird gross creatures...so sometimes theyll come around to say hi and see her but  most of the time they dont and they definitely dont care to hear stories or anything about her. The only ones who care are close family and friends and even then its no where near as exciting to them as it is for you. Dont let a social media announcement bring you to tears.

My husband kind of shrugged and asked me why I thought hed care because he finds me super sexy and hes been seeing me naked throughout the pregnancy so the number doesnt really matter. That made me feel pretty good to be honest.ETA I hear you on the nerves thing  although I havent had the same experience you did.

I did have concerns about the size as we live in a big city apartment on sixth floor but luckily we do have an elevator and it is very easy to collapse. We will also use it inside to let her sleep in for short naps if we have to cook or such. The price also reflects that it is from newborn until around  years. Also if you buy a quality brand the resell value is quite good. If my parents hadnt been so generous I would probably have opted for something way cheaper though it is a lot of money!

11147531,0,t3_5z4wts,Ugh this makes me so mad! I HATE when people give completely unfounded advice like this. My massage therapist I have chronic back issues that I see her for is big on alternativemedicine type stuff which is fine not my thing but whatever but when I told her I was flying to Chicago for my baby shower at  weeks she got all upset and said that the pressure change and accelerations from flying cause problems and knows someone whose placenta was pulled off of her uterus because of the pressureacceleration when she flew in her third trimester and had to deliver immediately and so this was a bad idea and for WEEKS kept telling me this and of course this started to make me anxious. So I investigated. Long story short There are certainly things to consider when flying but NO it is not because the pressureacceleration will hurt your placenta! Its stuff like stress dehydration and blood clotssitting too long or being away from your doctor if you have a risk of preterm labor. People who have issues like what my massage therapist described ALREADY HAD PROBLEMS GOING INTO IT and theres no evidence that the flight caused or aggravated it. If you have a normal healthy pregnancy and your doctor clears you and you make sure to hydrate and move around its perfectly safe. Peoples placentas dont get ripped off by plane accelerationpressure changes!! GAH! Anyway Ive been wanting to vent about that.

11753473,0,t1_dgs6hy2,I didnt mean to be an alarmist if you arent that itchy then it is probably fine.  I just thought my itching sounded the same  not so much on my hands and feet as on my thighs belly chest etc.  Sometimes it is worse than other times and usually is worst at night when I lay down to sleep.  But its a simple blood draw to rule out Cholestasis which might give you some peace of mind...,May2017Bumpers,dgsaal6,2,t5_3g9j6
