831808,0,t3_23n0xa,I will always say that I loved the Harnwell my freshman year got into a residential program Latin American Residential Program. But that isnt an option anymore and high rises are becoming increasingly competitive. I would suggest to try to do it through a residential program. When I applied for housing I thought it was mandatory to choose one not sure why I thought this so my four top choices were all programs. I think it gives you a better chance because it lets you apply and you can have a real person decide whether you will be part of the program or not not just letting a randomized system put you in anywhere.,UPenn,cgyturv,1,t5_2s4l8
1339030,0,t3_25r7dc,The only scenario I can think of where your engineering GPA is meaningful is if you want to go to a different grad school immediately out of undergrad.Otherwise your GPA is meaningless. What is meaningful is moving to where the work is. I had a .? GPA inside my major . total. As far as I know I was the highest paid engineer in my class because I moved to Houston and worked in the oil sector. I also got every other Friday off and paid straight time of each hour over  per week I worked...In college I wish I had known that it would have worked out that way as I would have spent less time feeling like a dumb ass.Take Cassels engineering economics  entrepreneurship courses.,UPenn,cik98zl,1,t5_2s4l8

7230437,0,t3_4ed89m,I have left reddit for a reddit alternative due to years of admin mismanagement and preferential treatment for certain subreddits and users holding certain political and ideological views.     The situation has gotten especially worse since the appointment of Ellen Pao as CEO culminating in the seemingly unjustified firings of several valuable employees and bans on hundreds of vibrant communities on completely trumpedup charges.     The resignation of Ellen Pao and the appointment of Steve Huffman as CEO despite initial hopes has continued the same trend.     As an act of protest I have chosen to redact all the comments Ive ever made on reddit overwriting them with this message.     If you would like to do the same install TamperMonkey for Chrome GreaseMonkey for Firefox NinjaKit for Safari Violent Monkey for Opera or AdGuard for Internet Explorer in Advanced Mode then add this GreaseMonkey script    Finally click on your username at the top right corner of reddit click on the comments tab and click on the new OVERWRITE button at the top of the page. You may need to scroll down to multiple comment pages if you have commented a lot.     After doing all of the above you are welcome to join me on a reddit alternative,UPenn,d201pgu,3,t5_2s4l8

7719413,0,t3_4ktasf,Just kill it off as soon as you can. You will be given the best preference for being placed in the class you want freshman fall. After that your influence over the selection process steadily degrades until they just place you wherever there is room.A few pieces of advice from someone who actually enjoyed writing seminar. No one likes writing seminar. I can think of about five people off the top of my head who actually enjoyed theirs and thought that they learned something. All of them took the same classinstructor as me sadly he has left the university.. The purpose of writing seminar is to learn to write not to learn about the subject matter. You are doubtless a very good writer considering you got into Penn but that is beside the point. The writing seminar does not care stop protesting and it will make your life easier. The writing seminar teaches a very very specific writing style and feeds it to you as gospel but it can still be useful.     Most students catch a whiff of the bullshit pretty early on and tune out but if you pay half an ounce of attention there are a few things to learn. At the very least jumping through all of the hoops they set out for you will teach you about organizing your thoughts when youre writing and give you some experience figuring out what strategies do and do not work for you.. Corollary to points one and two     Dont pick your absolute favorite thing as the subject of your writing seminar. Theres a good chance it will turn your joy to ashes in your mouth. Think the ColbertStewart writing seminar sounds like the bees knees because theyre your favorite comedians and your homework will just be watching their episodes? Dont. Colbert and Stewart are the subject of the course in the sense of a cadaver to be dissected not a topic to be studied. The class will suck all the fun out of your favorite thing by making you dissect every single bit of minutiae possible. Instead go for something vaguely interesting but that youre not all that invested in.. If not subject then what do you choose by? If theyre listed on PennInTouch try to pick a good instructor. Bonus tip this is how you should pick all your classes at Penn whenever possible. Ask around here or in the class pages about writing seminar teachers that people have liked in the past. There are a few diamonds in the rough.     Youre looking for someone who has an interest in the subject theyre teaching beyond just writing about it and is flexible enough with the rigid and I mean rigid instructional guidelines put forth by the writing department to try to teach you something about it in addition to the mandated curriculum. The mandated curriculum has nothing to do with your subject in keeping with the analogy above the curriculum teaches dissection exclusively. You want to find an instructor who will tell you the name and family history of the stiff youre working on in addition to how to hold the knife.. When all else fails grit your teeth and deal with it like the rest of us. People like to make a big deal about writing seminar myself included but its really not that bad if you dont fight it.,UPenn,d3jn7cp,5,t5_2s4l8

11393028,0,t1_dfn4gsq,Its not so much peer pressure as it is a pervasive attitude.  Ive never seen anyone get judgy about somebody else not trying to get an internship or something but its more like a group attitude that getting a wellpaid job after graduation is a higher priority.  Imagine having a very prestigious business school on campusthat kind of restlessness will rub off on other people even if they arent in that school. Since I was pretty positive I was going into grad school I didnt worry about it and other than having to hear people talk about it all the time it didnt really affect me.  What I did feel like affected me was thatwhether due to selfselection or being molded by this pervasive viewpointit never felt like there were very many antiestablishment kids compared to a school like UChicago.  Like even when they were protesting the establishment or trying to make change or just goof off it felt like they were always doing it in ways that would look good on a resume either that or singing in an a capella group.Im sounding a bit like a UChicago shill here but I cant imagine things like Scav happening at Penn.  Or silly things that take a lot of effort but would never translate to practical skills etc.  When I was visiting another friend at UChicago recently he had some friends in what basically amounted to the Break into old buildings on campus club where they would find ways onto roofs and forbidden areas etc.  You can bet that shit doesnt fly at Penn.  Theres a little bit of the silliness and fun at the Kelly Writers House but lets be honest its a serious institution with a busy schedule run by paid staff.Rant over!,UPenn,dfndtbh,4,t5_2s4l8
