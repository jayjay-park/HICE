He doesnt seem to be a natural leader in the Laursen or Petrov mould for example but his commitment is remarkable and hes the perfect example for Villa anyway of a youngn who came good primarily through graft and determination.

He is fast very strong has great vision and passing ability quality ball control and immaculate finishing.

4024646,0,t3_36i0ry,LONG POST WARNING!!I dont think we need manyany Top Top players our first XI is good enough for the position were going to aim for this coming season MidTable Breaking into the top half However we do need players to help strengthen our depth for when the inevitable Injury crisis comes and for EuropeCup competitions. Goalkeeper If we get flush with Cash this summer I would love us to get a young up and coming keeper and loan him back to his current club Timo Horn would be a great example. Guzan and Given while both flawed are good competition for each other this coming season however Given will be gone soon and a replacement will be needed who can give Guzan some competition and also play in cups etc. to give Guzan some time off.In Timo Horn If Flush with CashDefenceThis is the area we need to backup the most Richardson despite Tims praises isnt good enough Bacuna isnt a Right Back Vlaar can leave on a free and were also losing Herd and Stevens on frees I know what a loss. This summer we need to answer a few questions Are Cissokho Hutton and Lowton good enough for Tim? Can we trust the  Ceterbacks we have to go through a season without getting injured every  minutes? Do we play with Wingbacks or Fullbacks? Senderos Bennet Luna. Yay or Nay? Regardless I think we need at least a backup left back and a Centerback who can also cover other areasIn Andrew Robertson Kara MbodjOut Vlaar Herd Stevens RichardsonMidfield  As long as we keep Cleverly were sorted here. DelphWestwoodCleverly behnd Grealish for our first team and SanchezGardner behind SinclairGilBacuna for our backup team. Add to that if we get Kara Mbodj see above he can play anywhere down the spine of the team so we have cover to play in both formations.In Kara MbodjOut NZogbia Tonev SyllaForwardsSame as the midfield to be honest. If we keep Benteke the only question is How do we improve on Gabby. Replace Weimann with Callum Robertson from the Youth Squad and that alredy looks like a pretty solid group of Forwards. If we lose Benteke we have to replace him ASAP that single buy will shape our season more than any other.

Id prefer him at CM so we can include westwoodsanchez in the midfield. Good ol tim. Hopefully we keep hold of delph now and well have a lovely midfield providing sanchez hits form and the return of gardner and possibility of Tom carroll joining its exciting.

5495227,0,t1_cwe1tby,I very much disagree.I will concede that he is onedimensional but only in the sense that he has a goalscoring instinct. Not exactly a bad thing to have. I think Tim had the right of it when he said that Scotty is better when tucked in centrally rather than played out wide.Saying that he goes missing every game I think is ignorant. Sure when the opposition is laying seige to our box hes not noticeable but thats because hes pushing high waiting for a clearance. Every goal Scott Sinclair has scored for Aston Villa has been a result of his outstanding positioning. Thats not going missing thats putting yourself in space.As for poor linkup play there is plenty of evidence that suggest otherwise. In our game against Sunderland when Carles Gil made that fantastic run into their box he played a superb onetwo with Scott. In the Bournemouth game he had a couple of fantastic dribblesintolayoffs down the left hand side which unfortunately didnt turn into anything. But again he has a goalscorers instinct and I would argue is more suited to be at the end product of a buildup play rather than in the middle of it. Im very much for Scott Sinclair being given a chance at Striker ala Theo Walcott. But even then our lefthand side would be very dangerous with Scott  Amavi. ,avfc,cwe2flo,1,t5_2s569

5725183,0,t1_cx6py91,When youre talking about genes though you are talking about very minute differences in speed that will only allow black runners the chance to be . seconds faster. Christophe Lemaitre is still like the th fastest man in the world and many other white runners are very fast but of course that very minute gene gives the black runners an advantage. But players like Gareth Bale Son HeungMin Jamie Vardy Hector Bellerin Christiano Ronaldo.... Theyre comparably fast as black players and have no problems. Perhaps in a  yard dash against Theo Walcott they might lose by a minute amount but only barely. For footballing purposes theyre basically equally fast. I agree that Asian families might not have as much of a problem anymore though many still do but at the same time there are other factors that might discourage young Asian players lack of role modelsice breakers discouragement subconscious or conscious racism in scouting selection etc. gt Football is so ingrained into UK culture that I think its difficult for a foreigner to understand.Im a British citizen dont worry I understand perfectly fine. gt I think this backs up my assessment that its more to do with scouting and selection techniques rather than a stranglehold of the kids communities.I think this is true to some extent but I think subtle or subconscious racism plays a role here as well.
