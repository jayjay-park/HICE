389033,0,t1_cfkz1qr,Yes thats not a difficult concept to understand but I was aiming compare this dog to others Ive had experience with in response to the same situation. For example other dogs Ive cared for may have given up and quieted down after  minutes of being ignored whereas this one may continue whining for  minutes even though her reward for the behavior has only ever been being ignored. Of course I have no idea what kind of treatment she was used to for the first  months of her life before I adopted her but really she seems to be a bit more vocal in general than most other dogs in any situation. Good on you for taking a good approach to unwanted behaviors,tollers,cfl37r9,1,t5_2sm55
952618,0,t1_chcc6jg,Haha yeah I think she just had a funny growth spurt. It may also just be the photo when I look at other photos of that time period I dont see it. That photo is just too cute not to post.Here are a bunch of photos I took of her at the beach  months later so when she was about  months old. ,tollers,chckk3z,1,t5_2sm55
1494556,0,t1_cj2r1sx,Thanks! She is definitely a handful but I wouldnt trade these puppy days for anything. Im really excited for her first puppy classes which start on Thursday this week. I would love to do competitive obedience with her and probably agility too when shes older and her bones arent growing anymore.,tollers,cj3m8ln,1,t5_2sm55

2461152,0,t3_2noxgv,Ive lived with a toller for three years. Ive maybe heard the scream twice. It is not a deal breaker for an absolutely amazing and active breed of dog,tollers,cmfwem0,1,t5_2sm55

4913456,0,t1_cud6c51,We were home when this happened unfortunately or fortunately depending on how you look at it. She was alone in the bedroom for about  minutes before she decided it would be a great idea to chew through the fan cord. Thankfully she only bit through one half of it so she didnt get the full brunt of the electricity. ,tollers,cudvlv7,1,t5_2sm55
