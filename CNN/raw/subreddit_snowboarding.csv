3176,0,t3_1u5s38,So to practice keeping in control on ice practice your eurocarving. Eurocarving is when you are going across the hill you are trying to get your chest to touch the snow. This is usually easier on steeper hills. Eurocarving will help you technique with lower body steering and pressure control. This will help you carving on ice.

There are more options than helmet  reckless and no helmet  not reckless.Its clear that behaviour can be changed because the majority of people now wear helmets whereas they used to be a small minority. So I think the solution is to figure out how to encourage people to make smart choices and take informed risks while still wearing a helmet.Dont forget helmets protect you in accidental falls at slow speeds in low risk situations as well.

88530,0,t1_ceofhub,Ill preface this by saying that I havent done one in a few years and I was much less knowledgeable about it back then. I never sanded any of it. Mind you it was one single coat of spray paint over a paper stencil and then a couple coats of clear on the whole thing. This is approx. a  x  stencil. Ive never had one crack in over a decade of riding.If youre looking to paint the whole board youre going to want to sand it. This gives the paint more surface area to bond too. Go with a high grain count. Id say  range. Depending on your plans you may want some primer on there to avoid the current graphic showing through your paint.The problem is the more paint you apply the more you risk cracking it. Thicker paint is less flexible. Youre best option is a paint gun wet to a fine mist and then lightly dust each coat on without too much buildup. This is more important in the first couple layers dont go for full coverage just basic coating and it may look a little splotchy at first.Once youve got a primer coat and a couple thin layers of color nows the time to make sure the color is uniform and nothing is showing through. Keep the layers thin and the spray as fine as possible. After thats done go with some clear coat. I believe they make clear that is flexible as in less prone to cracking. Look for cold weather applications or a product made for flexible materials. I cant really provide any reference on this one.Make sure your dry times are evenly spaced between coats. Might want to do some research on painting techniques if youve never done it. YouTube is always a great resource for these things. I believe you dont want the paint to get too dry before moving to the next coat.Oh remember to wetsand between coats. Ask your local hardware store what grit they recommend but I know youre going to want something with a very high grit count so avoid leaving big scuff marks. Keep the surface wet and dont allow it to dry while sanding.This takes off any raised areas of the paint and also gives the next coat more surface area to bond to. Im not sure if you need to sand between every coat or just between primer color and then clear. Something to look into.Now dont take my advice as the gospel on this subject because I really dont want to be responsible for messing up your board. Ive never painted a whole topsheet before although I knew a girl whos father did. I would suggest researching my advice before doing anything. Im basing this off painting the occasional door panel what Ive seen on Overhaulin and their like and the knowledge Ive gained in various garages and mechanics forums.If I missed anything dont hesitate to ask.

140191,0,t1_ceucsvb,Portugee covers it all pretty well. Personally Id recommend Copper you get longer runs and the mountain is sorted out pretty well. To the west is mostly greens and easy blue runs under the Timberline lift while to the East you have your blacks and double blacks next to Super Bee and Alpine lifts. Theres are also a few nice bowl areas.  Drive time is about an hour and a half from Denver. I would advise against keystone just dont like that mountain its icy and the main beginner run schoolmarm has some very flat sections that beginner boarders often stall on. Traversing the different back sections of the mountain can also be a bit of a pain if youve never been there before as well. Breck is a really fun mountain with varied terrain that has some beginner terrain off of peak  and blues across the lower the mountain with good bowls in terms of Peak  and Imperial. Plus breck the town gives you that nice ski town feel. Definitely more resorty though. ,snowboarding,ceuebr1,7,t5_2qi0t

Consistently successful snowboarders heck anyone on the ski lift could argue that snowboarding is about riding for fun riding with friends and having a good time. I remember I did a report on White and why he isnt the best.. not based on talent but based on his outlook on the sport. To most snowboarders its a lifestyle. In his  Minute interview White was quoted saying you cannot have friends in this sport. Funny thing is... there is a crew of guys called the FRENDS crew. Everyone has friends in this sport but him. Do you ever notice after his sick runs who is there to congratulate him? His manager. Maybe Lago will give a cool bro hug but really White is alone in there because he alienates himself from everyone.

425157,0,t3_1yy3ba,Jesus what a horrible year to have to make that decision.  Hopefully you can postpone any decision until some later time in March...  It also isnt clear if you are stuck to one resort or if you can roam around...Kirkwood has the most diverse terrain with trees steeps cornices you name it its there.  That said most of it is barely rideable right now like most Tahoe places.  There is finally snow but the temps right now are near F so everything offpiste is ice for  of the day then slush.  Heavenly also has a lot of trees and some steeps but all this like at Kirkwood in only rideable on a good snow day.  We never do groomers and last weekend that is all you could do at Heavenly.  Likewise Squaw has lots of varied and advanced terrain when the snow is good.Unless things change your best bet will be to focus solely on the park if you want to do park more since all the other fun things you mentioned youd like to do are barely doable right now.  For park your options are wider Heavenly Northstar SierraatTahoe even Boreal for park laps.If you have to stick at one resortmountain the whole time Id pick one of the larger resorts like the Vail  or SquawAlpine just to have options.  If apres is important to you pick one based on that as well not Kirkwood in this case.  Finally if you have the option of going nearly anywhere else DO IT!  Book the trip to Mt. Bachelor or Washington or Wyoming or Montana or Colorado or Utah... You get the picture...Good luck man I dont envy you and this decision at all if this season holds up like it currently is in Tahoe.

427754,0,t3_1yyd5f,I ride a  and I love riding steeps more then probably anything.  If you are just getting into it you are gonna want to keep your speed down. You want to learn to make it down safely and controlled first before you start bombing stuff.  To initiate your turn you want to slightly adjust your weight over your front foot.  Think of it as on your edges you want to be heavy and in your turns you want to be light.  When you are at your lightest is where you want your edge transfer to happen its the same thing as jump turns except you are not jumping.  Your explanation of chatter when you are on your heel side is telling me that you probably are trying to offload to much speed. Try to keep your speed down when starting out and make tight turns and when you get to your heal side edge bend your knees and sit your but back over the board to keep your weight balanced. Nicely bent knees in an athletic position will help with chatter as well.In tight trees too off load your speed what I do I go up and over a tree.  What I mean by this is I cut back up hill to come up over a tree instead of going under it on a turn. I am not the greatest at tree riding though and I usually always keep it pretty slow unless I know the trees like the back of my hand.  Also what helped me out a lot in trees was instead of looking at the trees look in between the trees.  Honestly if you want to advance to be a much better rider getting super good in the moguls will help you with both steeps and trees. Start off on easier moguls and advance your self to black diamond moguls.  If you can efficiently and effectively ride black diamond moguls you should be able to ride steeps and trees pretty easily.EditI was looking up how to ride Steeps on youtube and found this video lol. it might give you a visual representation of what I was trying to explain. And when I said sit back I didnt mean sit back over the tail of the board but rather sit back into your turns when you go heal side.          ,snowboarding,cfp3oia,1,t5_2qi0t

If you go there during a time when people have a large chunk of time off you will end up hitting large crowds and waiting in lift lines on the front side for almost an hour. Where to find the best steepsgladesetc. Most of the best glades will be in Blue Sky Basin along with the most challenging terrain. The back bowls after a fresh dump are incredible and you can usually still hit some good pow in them a few days after a fresh dump. They can get moguled out quickly if they dont groom them or at least level out the moguls. Things to avoid The front side. This is where most of the people that dont have the skill level to ride the bowls or Blue Sky hang out so it will get crowded especially around midVail. The Dawg house food off Petes Express lift chair  made my friend get a nasty case of food poisoning so eat at your own risk Other tips Even though the lifts are named they often go by the lift  not name. Catwalks Catwalks everywhere. Plan on it taking you almost  minutes to get from the Blue Sky basin back to the front side and even longer if you are over in Lions Head Village.

The first time off the lift I ate it HARD slamming my back in to the ice. In that instance I asked myself the same question youre asking now. A few minutes later Id have my answer. I laid still for a quick second quickly assessed the situation and determined I was still intact. I got up got the hell out of the way of the lift and dropped in to the bowl.

1800546,0,t3_2f5eqp,The best advice for learning spend as much time on the snow as possible. My recommendation for your first time is to spend a week if possible. Usually the first day is just spent on your butt. Even turning your body around to the right direction is incredibly difficult for someone who has never been on the snow. If you just spend a day or two in this condition it wont be fun you wont really learn anything and you may lose anything you did gain since you will spend a lot of time off. If you spend a week somewhere along the way you will just start to get it and be able to leaf carve. You may even get to some rough carving by the end of that week. There is just a certain sweet spot thats like learning to ride a bike that usually takes more than  days. But everyone is different. I had a friend in hs a girl that just took one day to get to leaf carving and her second time up she was lacing together some forced carves. But shes incredibly smart. ,snowboarding,ck646hz,0,t5_2qi0t

1865150,0,t3_2fygbv,I havent had the same injurysurgery but heres the best advice I can give you. Take it how you want to    Do not rush back. Some people heal faster than others and itll be natural to try and fight to get back to what you were once doing very quickly. However doing so can ruin your body for the rest of your life. Not being able to snowboard for a few months is cake compared to not being able to snowboard for the rest of your life.    Get comfortable with what you do in your everyday life. If the doctors give you a physical therapy plan do it. Once youve conquered everyday activities only then can you think about doing things like snowboarding. Start slow and introduce your body to snowboarding movements gradually. Recovery from any type of surgery isnt gonna be overnight so dont set your expectations as such. Keep a good spirit about it too. Thatll help the time go faster than continuously dreading every waking moment not on the hill.,snowboarding,ckdy13d,1,t5_2qi0t

2001307,0,t3_2hmk0d,I started riding when I was  so about  and a half years ago on a school field trip. A couple of years later after quitting competitive hockey I started getting a lot more serious about progressing on my board and decided to teach myself. I live in the suburbs of a region where there are only hills no mountains so there wasnt much to choose from on the weekends but during winter breaks the family and I would drive from the cottage to the local hill and Id cruise around mainly on greens. I was getting maybe  days on snow at this point. Then when I was  I learned about a golf course  minutes from my house that turned itself into a ski hill in the winter. I went once a week for about  weeks as long as the snow lasted outside of any weekend trips in grades  and  and that helped me a ton. I confidently could link turns and ollie on flat and was working on riding switch and some buttering. The next two winters my parents took us to Mt. Tremblant for about a week and it was there I learned where my progression really was. I got better at the greens and riding flatbased and learned to stretch my freaking calves but I still wasnt happy.Finally this past winter my siblings and I drove from the cottage to a local hill and that was the day that everything changed. Maybe it was that we were the only three people on the hill and having people around me on the mountain still makes me anxious but something finally clicked. Snowboarding because less of a fight to get down the hill and more like a flow. It was amazing.This past season I probably got about  days on snow not a lot but about as much as my schedule allows but now that I live in an area with real! mountains within a reasonable driving distance Im getting quality days on snow not hours lapping a golf course behind a highway. I can finally carve and have tackled black diamonds successfully which my sister a skier is thrilled about because now we dont have to split up on the mountain. Im super excited for this coming season Ive found a skier friend and were going to hopefully take some trips together. Im going to try and work on riding switch and have started prepping for learning jumps and boxes!Tldr took me a while but snowboardings finally comfortable I can do black diamonds and now I get to carve real mountains.,snowboarding,ckucusz,1,t5_2qi0t

2081896,0,t3_2iq49o,I bought a Contour going on three years ago and I must say its been awesome. I think I have it on p fps instead of the pfps or whatever it is and the quality is great. Ive brought in all sorts of water pools lakes etc... and Ive never had any water get in or any problems. I have a ton of different mounts for it but I mainly keep it on a homemade pole mount. Its been tossed around between people and taken really hard falls. Also the battery life is incredible. Ill have it running for hours and hours and the battery led will still be green. Overall I would buy it again. But with that said I know GoPros are great too. I had tons of doubts about the Contour but it proved me wrong. So either or personally I think theyre both great products. ,snowboarding,cl4gdi3,2,t5_2qi0t

That and pulling the board up to grab it was made more difficult due to windresistance and weight of the board oddly enough.Heres a shot of one of the higher jumps I could get off it.I remember flipping being nearly impossible  if not just incredible difficult to swing the weight of the board overhead and  only jump around with it on for about  minutes before total exhaustion set it.,snowboarding,clevtjb,24,t5_2qi0t

I just dont want to get on a mountain board and realise I completely suck! As for what board iv been riding iv been given a different board every time I go to the hire place so theres no consistency. One week I have a really solid board the next week its more flexible and twin sided. I dont even know which ones I prefer because Im also wearing hired boots! Nothing actually fits me well enough to make that decision. So I think il have to just find a general all round board and see how it feels.

2642134,0,t3_2oyqnb,I have been skiing Tahoe for almost  years and I always stay in the South Shore area.  Heavenly is the most user friendly of the big  ski resorts. A little something for everyone the most nightlife restaurants plenty of snow making equipment when the snow gods dont cooperate and the highest elevation in the area. Plus it is cool to ski in  states in the same day. If you want to venture out there are shuttles that pick up at the casinos that will run you to Sierra and Northstar. Other options are van tours that hit other ski  resorts wine tours SF Virginia City and more.  If you plan to ski  or more days look into a season pass. Usually they are not sold this late but due to the drought they have extended the offers. Mine is good for Heavenly Northstar and Kirkwoodwith some restrictions.  As others have mentioned Kirkwood is tough to get to but well worth the drive!I stay on Kingsbury Grade so I always rent a car.

In fact there are twice as many guys in snowboarding Any accomplishment by a female rider immediately gets hateful RedditYoutube comments  stating how it means nothing because the men can do more. Female bodies are built very differently from male bodies and lack a lot of the advantages that male bodies have for sports somehow people dont realize this. I question why we even compare female athletic accomplishments to male ones so often. Women are naturally way more flexible than men but thats not valued in snowboarding. Local freestyle competitions dont take female riders seriously  heres one with  in prizes for the men  for the women Can you think of any recent team video parts with any female riders in them? There are certainly womens teams for most of these brands we just never get to see them outside of competition unless they release a personal video part.

3030613,0,t3_2uteyj,Dislocated my shoulder at Jay Peak like  weeks ago. I was doing that one last run and hit their rainbow box too slow. I took the majority of the hit with my shoulder and knee. I instantly knew something was wrong because I couldnt move my arm and my muscles were tight as hell. Fortunately I was able to walk to ski patrol and on the way there I got help from one of the park builders. He told me to just relax myself and I did. My shoulder simply fixed itself right as I was able to walk in the ski patrol door. I got a sling but used it for like  days and went riding the next weekend. Its still a little odd feeling but I am lucky it wasnt worse.,snowboarding,coc4d0y,2,t5_2qi0t

However the middle strap has a quick tightening feature as it sounds like you know. I loved my flows until one day first run pop! The MFer ripped and I had to edge all the damn way down. With that said I got Burton Malavitas and couldnt be happier. No slower to strap in than the flows. Hope that helps. Go with GNU or lib tech.

Go Zephyr or Eskimo and take Cranmer to Village Way and try out ReRailer there are some bigger railsboxes on skiiers right and a pair of jumps bigger than Ashcats.  If thats still not advanced enough for you hit RailYard and continue through to the Dark Territory youll need to watch a Park Etiquette video to acquire access youll find all the jumps you want there  the ones at the beginning arent terribly huge and theres no pressure on you to hit all of them just do the ones youre comfortable with and ride over the hip of the others.,snowboarding,cogm3m7,2,t5_2qi0t

Its a bit hard to get out of the Tremblant village since youre sort of in the middle of Canada but dining on site isnt too bad if you want to go out for a night or two. Bring your own food to make before you get into town sandwiches Clif bars etc you dont want to be eating out for every meal since it will get expensive. As far as food goes Le Diable is a bar in town but has some tasty dishes that are decently priced their ribs are quite good. It isnt necessarily cheap a meal will cost a decent  CDN but isnt bad as a whole. As far as snowboading goes on the north side there is a peak accessible by the Edge chair with some excellent glades which are more than worth a run or two. If you have any more questions want to know anything more feel free to pm me I spent the whole of last week there and had a blast. Cheers. ,snowboarding,cour992,1,t5_2qi0t

Your legs will continue spinning. Once you spot the landing keep your eye on it until you land then quickly turn your head to see where youre going.

3375340,0,t1_cpcobba,Go on the flattesteasiest trail you can obviously and pretend you are learning to ride all over again. Start by side slipping down the hill then put more pressure on the heel of your normallyback foot and go nice and slowly downhill a bit. Get comfortable doing that. So the same thing on your toeside. Its pretty much the falling leaf. Get really comfortable on both edges and then try linking your turns. Remember to let your board do most of the work dont force the turn. Thats something you usually forget because you are so used to riding regular. Go on your heel edge then when you are ready to turn ease up and let the board point downhill on its own and then switch to toeside. So in short just relearn snowboarding all over again But really keep these things in mind You need more pressure on your forward foot in order to go in that direction.Try to avoid leaning back because you will probably be doing that a lot out of fearWear kneepads if you have them I slammed really hard going really slowly trying to learn switch this year and I had to sit on the side of the slope for  minutes before I could even move my leg comfortably again.,snowboarding,cpd0i54,3,t5_2qi0t

3417308,0,t3_2zd3qu,I just recently DIYed my split. Its the most inexpensive way to get a splitboard and not all that hard to do. Previously I had been boot packing and snow shoeing when necessary. The splitboard was the best decision I made for my back country excursions though I have gotten through more than a few seasons with snowshoes and crampons. Splitboarding really allows me to go deeper due to carry less weight and more efficient movements. There is def a learning curve to skinning and alternating between tour and downhill modes. It took me several trips before I was comfortable changing over. I get way more float on my split over snowshoes which means I have a lot easier time when breaking trail. On the flats and bootpack I can push glide my split in tour mode. Its far more efficient and faster than hiking. Plus you dont have the weight and top heavy nature of carrying your board on your pack When bushwacking this is especially nice.  As far as weight in terms of pack and gear you can see why some basic ultralight gear is so expensive. People will pay a lot to cut weight. The more trips you take the more you will realize what you actually need in the back country and you will stream line your load out. As you become a stronger back country rider your pack will start to feel like its a natural part of you. make sure you check out spliddit ,snowboarding,cphsq4b,7,t5_2qi0t

I picked up a more free ride oriented North Face jacket during closing weekend sales last spring when my older Burton jacket fell apart it was one from before the long cut became fashionable anyway because it always was a bit too short for me but I havent really tested it yet. It seems to fit my needs but it still has quite some insulation so Im a bit worried about that.On the colder days ltF Ive been wearing Airblaster one pieces lately. Theyre actually surprisingly comfortable. Wick well I didnt really overheat that much but especially help against cold wind and snow creeping up your back. Ive never really worn a mid layer for longer than an hour. I know all about cold  face though. Got some unpleasant frost bite in a blizzard in Val Thorens a while ago. I wasnt cold at all so I didnt notice but when I got back my nose didnt look too attractive for a quite a while. Now I take better care of that.

I prefer Union myself the Atlas would be the ones to compare to Cartels but like most other things its all about personal preference.That said if youre looking to save some coin bindings are one of the better places to do it. Inexpensive bindings like the Burton Custom or Union Force are damn good at what they do and dont cost a lot of money. Theyre also produced in greater quantities so the odds of finding leftovers on sale even this late in the game are pretty good. Hell I dont really think theres anything wrong with the Rossis you originally asked about.

I did once take a lesson as a kid at a place near lake Geneva and I remember it being terrible. Most resorts that are a day trip from Chicago have pretty shitty rentals compared to the real mountains eastwest. Also buying your gear will pay for itself if your going more than a couple times this season. The windward boardshop on Clark are pretty cool snowboard focused. The Rei people in Lincoln park are also pretty good they did a nice job when I got my board a good tune up. They can help you with jacket and pants and that kinda stuff as well. There is also Viking ski shop which has been around forever and did some nice custom inserts for my boots a while back. Do you have a winter jacket already I assume so living in Chicago if so youve already got some gear. Heres a list of stuff youll need to boardSnowboard BindingsBootsWarm underwear leggingsunder armor type stuffSki socksSnowpants or bib like snowpant overallsJacket quite long and waterproof so when you bend over you dont get snow up thereLayers depending on how warm your jacket istemps that dayGloves or mittens waterproof and warmHelmet pretty important when learningHat optionalGoggles or maybe sunglasses I would go goggles as they protect your face from the elements more and are less prone to break but some people prefer sunglasses Things you can rent at the resort are Board bindings boots helmet,snowboarding,cvt1u7o,1,t5_2qi0t

5340758,0,t3_3o59hz,I hate to have to tell you this but if youre just traveling around chasing snow and hiking unfamiliar zones youre never going to develop a working knowledge of the snowpack youre riding. Furthermore you wont be able to develop the knowledge of the terrain youre interested in to really allow you to make good decisions when youre out on the slope. Book knowledge and class knowledge mean very little in the backcountry. A familiarity with the snowpack and the terrain is everything.

5364294,0,t1_cuc0r3o,I went  and  and had an RV this year in tailgate.  The price of the campsite this year was included in the ticket but in  you had to pay extra.  Saying that  had free beer in the beer garden each night ... so Im guessing if they lost Alaska Brewing Company as a sponsor then they had to offer something for the ticket price.   they were pretty strict on who could go into the Tailgate area only people with passes but this year it was pretty relaxed.We got the second largest sized RV from Great Alaskan as there was a deal ... I think it was around  per night.  It might pay to get the windscreen insurance ... its about  less than paying for a windscreen but we counted about  in every  cars on the freeway had cracked wind screens ... the odds are on a drive to Valdez from Anchorage youll get a chip.Also do a very thorough check of any tiny mark on the RV and make sure its documented.  There was a small round white sticker covering a hole on the inside door of ours  and the van company when we returned the RV tried to tell us that we broke in with a screwdriver punched a hole in the door and tried to cover it up.  Luckily we noticed the patch and had it documented on the paperwork.  Seemed pretty dodgy to me that they seemed to know where to look for that hole and had some idea of how it might have been made.  We also overheard some other Tailgaters getting grilled on some small marks and charged big  for some marks!  Beware!BTW  It can get down to C on some nights ... make sure you plan for that.,snowboarding,cvxcl0d,1,t5_2qi0t

5639993,0,t1_cww6d0e,yeah the h will add more power I mean you could go up to h or h the skys the limit but more power  more money. From the one me and my friends built which I have to say was probably on its last legs since most of it was built from salvage and scrap. But we put an h pocket bike motor on and it suited most of are needs I weigh around lbs and it was able to haul me up some waist high kickers with ease. That being said I found the winch to be more of a pain in the ass it was incredibly heavy and we were fucking lazy and didnt put any wheels on it so it took two of us to haul it around. It made a lot of noise which would attract attention usually unwanted attention. And it swallowed gas like crazy. After  or  minutes it would crap out and we would have to flood the engine with gas to get it running again. Not to mention the few times security gave us the boot I mean its not like a camera you cant just run from security with the thing. But that was a very minor issue in my book since I have had experience with hauling generators and lights which is about the same deal with security. Overall I would say the winch experience was  fun when it worked but a lot more effort than it was worth. ,snowboarding,cww71f9,2,t5_2qi0t

Telluride is the steepest of the three and has some pretty epic bowls so if you can hit that on a powder day its crazy fun.Purgatory is mellower but has some fun stuff and is a good option for avoiding crowds.

6507672,0,t3_44s4ca,This could be due to a few factors. These factors also seem to compliment each other. If your boots are too loose or not fitted properly this can cause some pain.  Additionally if because of this you are bending you foot to create toe side pressure instead of relying on the front of your boots shin area to create that pressure it can over stress the muscle causing cramping.  It could also be that your boots are just not well fitted to your foot shape and the extra movement inside is causing this.  I would recommend making sure your boots are very tight and your bindings are tight but not too tight. Use the shin of your boot to put pressure on the toe side.  It might also be worth taking your boots to a snowboard shop that can heat mould them to your foot shape.  This will probably help with the cramps and improve your riding.  Hope that helps!,snowboarding,czsfy11,5,t5_2qi0t

6721824,0,t3_47ompk,So Im headed back for my second trip beginning of next week. I went for  days in January for the first time ever. Id never even touched a snowboard and I fell in love. I didnt take any lessons and I felt I grasped it pretty good. Went down my first run the last day while plowing down the big hills and getting stuck and a few brutal falls on catwalks I felt it was a major success. Now Im not afraid of falling. I went into it knowing I was going to bust my ass and came away with some pretty nasty bruised ribs on the last day but obviously that didnt stop me. Now closing in on my second trip I cant help but feel super anxious  worried about doing worse or not improving at all. I want to get my turns down where Im linking turns down runs instead of plowing the hills. Not being able to turn as well as I needed is what also lead me to get stuck on the catwalks a few times. Is this a normal thing that everyone goes through? Usually Im not anxious about things.  ,snowboarding,d0elezs,1,t5_2qi0t

You really cant afford to pop off the tail as much and have to slide forward alot harder than usual even just a small tail pop does alot more off of a steep lip and you have to adjust your timing when shifting forward to be alot quicker.  Even just trying to pop off of those small abrupt tiny speedbumps has a very different feel and feels very awkward at first.    Maybe try keeping the pop more in the snowboard and letting it go as vertical as it wants while keeping your core balance.

Temperatures and humidity extremes can cause damage to the wood warping cracking rotting or laminates glue separation.The wax on the base is to prevent the base from dying out while sitting in storage for such a long time.Some people also recommend taking off the bindings to let the mounts in the deck relax for storage.I wall mount mine in my room for storage.,snowboarding,d2yu6um,4,t5_2qi0t

This is useful for beginners learning to turn advanced riders who need a tighter turn that can keep speed slow and freestyle riders for a bunch of different tasks Prewinding spins boardsides speed checks etc.     People like Terje use forward stances are also coming from a super old and outdated time in snowboarding. Theyre iconic names not riders who are pushing the limits of snowboarding. Regardless Terjes style of snowboarding is more about freeride and carving these days than anything else.

Will totally slay rails and boxes but you might struggle on the jumps. Hurrithanes are good bindings they have a loose floppy feel and are a blast to tweak and flex. If you go with this setup you will find it to be a blast on rails and medium sized jumps but poor on groomers and any kicker over .

8089060,0,t3_4q03nc,My shoulder got dislocated during a surf trip in Portugal half a year ago. I managed to put my shoulder back in its position by myself but I still visited a doctor afterwards to make sure everything was okay which he could state after some Xray pictures. I recommend you to first of all go see a doctor and make sure that nothing is broken in your shoulder. If your shoulder looks fine and you really want to get on your board directly you can if you tape your shoulder like in this video  I did this and could surf the day after paddling on my board without any issues the taping method is really effective. But in the long run its not sustainable to tape your shoulder like this every time you want to shred. To make your shouder strong again and prevent it to dislocate again you HAVE to strengthen the muscle groups around your shoulder. Some easy and good exercises I would recommend are these If you google you will find more of these. This is really important if you dont want it to happen again because if it happens once the bigger is the chance that it happens again. I would recommend you to hit the gym once in a while because it is so worth it in the long term. Bad shoulders is a bitch but if you make a little effort in the gym it wont be a problem!I hope this helped! Shred safe. Peace. ,snowboarding,d4pa8ya,2,t5_2qi0t

Its not so much the individual board that suits  but more so the type of feature on that board that makes a difference.For example I used to always ride camber until I tried a banana  and it was soo awesome. I was just floating around everywhere and it was just so much more inline with how I like to move my board around.Or maybe I tried a board that was slighly longer than I usually got  and I hated it. Felt like I couldnt control it as much.Finding that sweet spot in size and shape is what will make most difference to your riding as opposed to an individual board delivering the experience unless it is just coincidentally having all the features that match you better,snowboarding,d4zpuxx,2,t5_2qi0t

The only time it isnt the best is when youre on icy snow skinning on a convexrolled over hillside thats the only time Ive experienced the drawback of having rocker in the middle. My skins suck though so that was probably a factor. Riding wise its dope. Quick turns and a nice poppy flex. It rides like my solid t.rice but a little snappier since its the horsepower construction.

Feel bad for you living in Texas even in Southern California we have at least some snow. Unless you are a racer there are few people that think a snowboard is too slow. If you can snowboard decently its rarely about going as fast as possible and snowboards are already quite fast. If you could somehow improve the speed of a snowboard I commend you but it would require some good pressure. So as rider I do not think more speed out a snowboard. Doesnt seem like you know snowboarding too well so Ill but this as simple as possible. Lots of us dont look for speed more beautiful scenery good snow jumps rails   and many other things that dont require speed.

So rather than just rolling out of your hotel room and wandering to the lift you have to pack up your shit get in a car or bus and drive either  minutes to Sunshine or  to Louise.  At Sunshine you still have to haul your shit up the gondola to get to the goods.If all you want to do is ride every day look into someplace like Big White where you can stay on the hill.

9081085,0,t1_d82yzq3,  My only thoughts on sizing down is it only really comes into play if youre comfortable riding...lets say a  standard width... and want to switch to a wider board because suddenly your feet got bigger or you got tired of riding duck foot to keep your toes from dragging.  If you want to keep close to the same net weight under your feet you want to buy your wide board a little short.  Because if you buy a  Wide suddenly you added maybe  cm   of material to the surface area of your board Im horribly estimating here dont take that math literally.  Thats gonna feel strange under you and might make control feel heavier and unruly.  You counter that added width material by taking away some material from the nose and tail shortening to maybe a .  Giving you a familiar ride with a new width.  Nothing Ive ever heard of says you cant still ride a  Wide if you wanted to float on top of powder like Legolas or something.   I personally dont ride wide boards because I got tiny little size . U.S boots so Ive not done a ton a research on it.  Never heard of any other reason you should size down... Edit also remember a wide board will be stiffer than a narrow board of the same length helping you to control Those aggressive turns by absorbing force in the core without a longer lever like I mentioned above. Remember stiffness is relative to an individual companies product line and NOT universal... a  stiffness in Burton is NOT the same as a  Stiffness in Lib Tech.  ,snowboarding,d83eddn,1,t5_2qi0t

Keeping pressure the front foot not only helps to point the board down the hill but to bring the nose around the last  degrees to end up parallel with the hill. The steeper the slope and the more speed the faster youll complete the edge transfer. ,snowboarding,d91sn9b,3,t5_2qi0t

10008153,0,t3_5iz0t2,Its tougher on steep slopes because your brain is telling you that you dont need to lean forwards anymore... but you do.Here are some pointers.. When I was learning I would try to put my hand as close to the front top of the snowboard as possible.  This would help me stay oriented and make me realize when Im not actually putting my weight forward.. Keep your weight over the board when stopping.  If you lean too far back on a heel side stop or turn then youll jackhammer and then wash out. Keep your weight forward on the front to back axis but centered on the side to side axis so that your weight is keeping your edges engaged. Pick your line.  Heel side turns are tougher than toe side turns so try to time your run so that the heel side turns are on the lesssteep parts of the run.   . Try to apply pressure evenly and remember that the tighter the turn the more pressure youre applying so dont be afraid to take much larger turns and pick up speed... usually its when youre trying to stop or slow down on a steep run that youll wash out.,snowboarding,dbc3a22,4,t5_2qi0t

This gives you a rudder effect rather than letting the back end pivot with most of the pressure on the front foot during turn initiation.

10733733,0,t1_ddmxota,Its a big deal how other people ride on the hill. I avoid hills like snow valley Ontario because there are so many noobies that inadvertently block me from going fast on the narrow black diamonds. for instance some kid scraping down the hill on his ass because OMG STEEP Plus snowplowing and sideslipping wrecks the hill.Secondly if you cant keep up with friends you are probably killing the fun for them. Nobody likes waiting at the bottom every time or spending all day on greens. This is coming from someone who has taught most of his friends to snowboard and now they are all pretty strong riders and can keep up. I put time into teaching them on greens so that after a dozen trips to the hill they can fly down black diamonds with me. Calling OP an asshole for asking how to improve his friends riding is the most aloof thing Ive read all day. Third if OPs friend learned some edge control instead sideslipping hed have way more confidence would enjoy riding much more and be able to keep up with OP eventually. Are you trying to argue that OP should respect his friends right to be ignorant?Finally Ive never seen a group of snowboarders over the age of  that care about being cooler than anyone else of the hill. I dont give a shit what I look like to you nor do I care how you look to me because Ill probably never see you again.

Mountain Creek is also very similar with their lift closing policy and you can get stuck on one face if they close the lifts. Lots of congestion. I would drive the extra  minutes and go to Big BoulderJack Frost or hit up Shawnee if you want to stick in that area. Big Boulder is my personal favorite especially if youre into parks.

I know plenty of people who only hit the slopes a handful of times a year and only have their stuff waxed at the beginning of the season.

Last thing I have the ability to adjust the vertical angle of the highback would it be dumb to lean the highback more backwards?   ,snowboarding,dervd1q,2,t5_2qi0t

11266624,0,t1_df90t1r,When I teach I get the kids to try something called zombie turns. Basically without turning your body at all you lean forward or backward keeping you knees and ankles locked. This allows the board to do all the work by going up on its edge and using the bend and shape giving perfect crescent turns. If you combine this with flexion at the right time you can increase your speed with every carve ,snowboarding,df9206s,2,t5_2qi0t

11481166,0,t1_dfxcefd,Im a derp so like sometimes I would forget to get on the lift... like I would just stand there and the chair would kinda just go past me and Id miss it. So its been an ongoing joke between me my coaches and the lifties who have witnessed that. The crew at my local mountain are super chill. If it was a big resort mountain idk how well that would fly without someone being pissed hahaha Maybe you should try that haha,snowboarding,dfxdyk2,3,t5_2qi0t
