128076,0,t3_1sy0v7,Both weapons are fine as they are they dont need tweaking for as much as theyre used.Your main gripe appears to be that the KGB swings too slow and the Basher too fast but you also increased the duration of the bleeding for the Basher and reduced the selfdamage on hit that in itself is pushing it into OP territory.As for the KGB exactly how does one take more damage while they have a pair of padded red gloves in front of their face  of the time? And the slower swing speed is intentional because without it the Heavy can get a sixth critical hit in during a melee bout... while with a  slower swing speed he can only get five hits in. And for that matter you wont even use the crits with your melee that often get a kill switch to your Minigun and enjoy longrange crits for what feels like days.,TF2WeaponIdeas,cet0le1,2,t5_2vlc0
247096,0,t3_1wxwm4,I think this needs reworking...  Not that the concept is bad but it seems to me like it replaces a lot of the things the classes are supposed to do.  For one the Disguise Kit is the Spys PDA and a lack of disguise puts him at a severe disadvantage you would need the YER to disguiseTwo the Engineers PDAs both serve important functions so Id assume youre removing the Destruction PDA?  Thats not as debilitating as with Spy but the inability to destroy buildings can actually be quite bad.

1485698,0,t3_2b7do1,Whooooooa dang I havent read it yet but I will do soon.I was actually just about to writepost not one but two posts of ideas for the engineers PDA myself...Edit Read through it now.... it was interesting. So you have to place it on an ammo pack and then to get the maximum utility out of it you would want to place your Sentry right next to it. Obviously as you said you dont have to put the sentry right next to it but unless youre using gunslinger if Ive understood it right you cant place a level  sentry anywhere else on the map until youve let it sit by the dispenser and get upgraded  you can place a level  anywhere you like but you cant use melee to upgrade it. So using this tool would mean your dispenser is always in a pretty obvious location on top of any  ammo box or maybe on a  ammo box and unless its functional and right next to your other buildings you cant upgrade anything... you mentioned itd allow your Engy to be more flexible but... I think itd make it quite restrictive  theres only a couple places to put your nest and if you move your sentry away from there and then it goes down you have to trek all the way back to the dispenser to build a new one...Also the teleporter  youd want to put the dispenser somewhere right next to spawn so that its not so exposed but that means that either you put the teleporter entrance next to your dispenser  and risk allies never even seeing it or you have the exit next to the dispenser which makes it kinda a shortuseless teleporter until you move it away from the dispenser. But again if it gets sapped or destroyed does the other end of a teleporter keep its level if one end is destroyed by anything but a sapper? Im not sure on this one youd have to take it all the way back to the dispenser to upgrade it again...I guess there could be a form of dispenser griefing  if you use the Gunslinger then the dispenser suddenly becomes a lot less vital  you need less metal and you dont need to upgrade your sentry. So you could place the dispenser on top of one of the ammo packs near the enemy lines  denying them ammo until theyve destroyed the dispenser and up to  seconds after that. So if you know an enemy engineer wants to build a nest you can place the dispenser over a  ammo crate and every time the dispenser takes damage you know that either its just a random enemy attacking it or the engineer is trying to build a Sentry there so you can run in and take him out before he can set up.The biggest debuff though is the If you die your buildings lose  levels thing  if youre turtling and you get killed its a good chance your buildings would go down anyway even if youre using the normal PDA unless youre part of an Engy nest where the other Engies could look after your stuff while youre respawning  so it doesnt really affect you when youre staying at your nest. But it really heavily affects you if youre wandering around away from your nest  with a normal PDA if you got killed when youre nowhere near your stuff thered still be a fair chance that your buildings would stay intact but with this PDA not only do all your buildings level down but any allied Engies cant repair or upgrade your stuff while youre respawning...So... youre really not going to want to die with this PDA because if you do most of your buildings are screwed... Apparently this is supposed to encourage wandering outside away from your nest? But unless the other team are completely incompetent or newbs I refuse to say Gibus  noob because my Scout proudly sports a lime green Gibus! then theyll probably kill you while youre roaming  even if youre great with the Widowmaker a competent sniper or soldier could easily still pick you off. Especially if they have figured out you have the PDA  if you have level  buildings and they know that killing you will reduce your buildings to level  or if you have less than level  buildings they know that killing you will destroy your stuff then youll be possibly even higher priority as a target to kill than the Medic.So in all... a pretty cool idea  Ive often thought how neat itd be to have a dispenser that built and repaired your nest while you could go out roaming  but unless youre playing against the worst pub teams you wont want to move any level  buildings outside of the dispensers range and youll want to stay out of sight of the enemy as much as possible  completely defeating the supposed aggressive playstyle the new PDA gives you...The one thing I think it does have going for it is that  ironically  itd make an amazing tool for turtlingsentry nests with another engineer. If you place your dispenser on an ammo pack then youll get  metal secs plus any that you find nearby and all the other Engies will still get  ammo plus the ammo in their dispensers  placing the dispenser on an ammo pack basically doubles the utility of the ammo pack.So cool idea  nice thought behind it but awful for aggressive playstyle and even better for campingnestingturtling whatever you call it.,TF2WeaponIdeas,cj2i9ua,5,t5_2vlc0
1550616,0,t3_2an9ss,Is  damage really worth it? Especially of you have a slow attack speed it would make sense to just increase the range to  even skilled players need to time to react when they hear the rocket jump sound effects. The lack of range and lack of attack speed make it useful less. You can also remove random crits if you need anything to penalize that isnt too much of a loss. I think the first two go great since the soldier is a spam class not saying it doesnt take skill but you need a good fire rate for area denial it would maoe sense that he had a useful secondary spam that allowed teammates to spam safely.,TF2WeaponIdeas,cjan620,1,t5_2vlc0

3242933,0,t1_coxxh5h,This idea was meant to be a more strategic weapon. It encourages being a more offensive medic without being overpowered. It deals less damage than stock syringe gun making it a less useful weapon for damage output. Sapping health benefits you and friendly players as it boosts heal rate but doesnt let you wreck the enemy team.It was meant for situations where the medic would be better attacking someone killing his patient. For example your demo is taking continuous damage from a pyro torching him. The pyro will inevitably wound up killing the demo provided the pyro is elusive enough. The Dark medigun will assist you by sapping health from the pyro then quickly switch back to the demo to take advantage of the heal rate bonus. And if that pyro torches you then you can extinguish yourself and heal back a portion of health.,TF2WeaponIdeas,coy4ymk,2,t5_2vlc0

I would personally replace the lower sapping power by making the building have a very slight damage resistance. This way a downside is fully applicable to both groups There is a downside to the Engineer and his team if the building gets destroyed which is also a downside to the Spy mind you while at the same time there is a noticeable downside to the Spys team.

Enabling the Sniper to fire a few rounds into a cluster of enemies and see them for  seconds is pretty OP considering he can kill you from literally anywhere on the map...This would do well with the Huntsman maybe but thats too situational to not be broken. I suggest maybe a holster penalty or smaller clip to balance it out. Each of these respectively would force the Sniper to act faster and make the bolts actually count. Id also keep the reserve ammo as normal or even lower it. And possibly lower the clip. Having a teammate with almost permanent wallhacks is better than a Sniper anyday.The Cloaking and healing thing is cool tho. Id make it so cloaking removes it completely at the cost of a full second of cloak tho. Being visible under cloak is more than annoying. The HHH has made that painfully clear...Also what happens if an invis Spy is hit?And maybe the enemy not knowing theyre being seen thru walls is a bit problematic...Otherwise I think this is probably the most balanced if not one of the more balanced incorporations of wallhacks Ive seen.Pre Gud Bro.,TF2WeaponIdeas,d9qyehf,1,t5_2vlc0

Personally I think you should scrap the recharge times of the rockets and replace it with an ammo cost to firing a rocket while maintaining a separate variable for amount of rockets that doesnt recharge but rather is refilled by ammo sources  ammo for a rocket and uses one rocket ammo.

9874988,0,t3_5g8f4o,Im gonna say this here since its a little more relevant than the other post and I didnt get a chance to comment on it before this one went up. The problem with Slowing amp Stunning effects that nobody on your previous post touched upon is that if these effects are out of the players control ie Not self inflicted via taunt item use or other it is and always will be OP in the hands of a competent player. I would call the Natascha an exception to a very slim degree but Ill touch upon that laterThe Sandman while yes it is poorly executed is a prime example. Just a click of a button and a player proficient enough with it gets to impair movement for doing things normally. Removing this from the Sandman ball and applying it to the bat itself would make little difference. Even if the stunslow was  or less and compounded with each hit or was just a flat age of slowstun it is out of your control and there is little to nothing you can do about that. A competent player with weapon that has either of the stats I listed would want to get close to the enemy via flank or sneaky tactics to hit them a couple times reduce them to a snail then kill them. Any way you look at the stun its very broken if it is out of the players control wether or not it is happening. Now I am aware that in this post you limit the slowing to only  classes. I however would limit it to just . The classes not allowed to posses Stunning or Slowing abilities MvM Excluded should be Scout Soldier Pyro Demoman Sniper Spygt  Pyro is a given obvious as to why stunning and slowing should not be granted to himherit and is somewhat of an exception to the rules.Before you go on about Sniper amp the hitscan rule keep in mind the Huntsman and huntsman like weapons appear in the workshop and on the subreddit. They are projectiles. The same goes for things like Jarate for instance. But AoE slowing is off the table and always has amp will be.Now. I would reword Rule into Mobility amp Strength at Range Means There Shall be no DazeYou argued the Scouts reasoning for not having the power to stun as manoeuvrability over all other classes. I would also argue to apply this to Soldier as he has incredible mobility with rocket jumping and the various forms of it. The range part is where Sniper comes in The Huntsman amp Huntsman type weapons. Projectiles in other words. Having a long ranged stun on a Sniper bow No matter the counter debuffs is almost exactly akin to the Sandman now. Range and power over movement are too strong when mixed together. As for the rest of the classes you pretty much explained why they shouldnt have it.This leaves us with  classes. Heavy Engineer amp Medic.  Classes to be granted the special movement impairing ability. Following the previously set rules we know that Hitscan is off the table Majority of these classes weapons Sentries are out and utility is utility... not much else to say about that. That leaves us with  Medic Primary amp Melee Weaponry to grant the stunning amp slowing to. Now that I think about it a minor slowing effect on enemies on the CC wouldnt toooooo bad....... But the real problem is that the effect is now restricted to the melee weapons of the  classes in the game that use other more reliable means of attacking Or in the Medics case Healing  of the time. Effectively rendering the special effect useless. In TF Mobility is power. s has proven that thoroughly enough. Having a movement impairing effect in TF limits that power but the effect can only be applied in certain places without being deemed broken by the best of the best. Sadly those places it can go are where it ends up getting the least attention.Now. The ground rules for Mobility Impairing effects. If you have mobility you should not have the ability to impair mobility. If you have Strength at range you should not have the ability to impair mobility. Hitscan should not have the ability to impair mobility. Natascha. Let me explain.I believe that the Natascha can work. The only problem atm is that the scaling for the Slow effect is all sorts of messed up. I will attempt to explain my theory on how to fix this as best I can.Now. Lets look at damage rampup amp falloff. It goes from  at max rampup  at base damage then  at max falloff. Im unsure exactly what the current scaling for it is but it most definitely has a noticeable effect at maximum or at least near maximum falloff. Which is what I think to be the problem. My proposal is to shift the rampup for the slow to a very sharp incline within the rampup and almost nothing in the falloff. To better explain this think of the Slows effectiveness as a percentage.  being basically stunlock amp  being nothing.ampnbspExperimental ScalingSomething like at  ramp there is  slow. Going down to  Ramp there is only around  Slow. At  Base there is  Slow. Going to  and lower Falloff there is  Slow. And everything in betweenScaling similar to this or along those lines would make the weapon less of an annoyance and more of a utility for up close and personal fighting. In the end my point is this can work with the correct scaling. All it needs is some tweaking.EDIT Something like this or even maybe the slow ends quicker.,TF2WeaponIdeas,dauqfu0,1,t5_2vlc0

10103504,0,t1_dbo7eac,Enforcer Again I have to disagree with you on the Spy being the flimsiest class in the game given the faster movement speed and his revolver Id say the Spy is about as flimsy as an Engineer at best while the Sniper is actually weaker. The Spy however does have to put himself at far more risk which might give the impression of him being flimsier.  True every other class can outdamage the Spy rather easily. Such is why I went back to boosting the Enforcer at the cost of stealth it would effectively turn the Spy into a combatcapable Medic minus the regeneration but plus the ability to cloak and disguise. I did this because last time the Enforcer was overpowered because its damage boost came without an effective downside.  It was brought up that the reduced accuracy is probably a bad idea and that the Enforcer would need something else to actually be a combat pistol. I was considering removing the accuracy downside and having it instead restore health on hit allowing the Spy to potentially keep up with enemies as every two shots would almost be the equivalent of a health pack. Would also be good when needing to escape since your shots can restore your health as you backpedal. The whole thing would require a different playstyle as a Spy one where you support your team more actively in combat by coming at enemies from odd angles to catch them offguard or distract them alongside your allies rather than specifically targeting individual players for quick elimination. As to your suggested changes  Damage Piercing It would be nice if that effect worked properly they could of just made the Enforcer deal environmental damage or something Id think in any event though I dont think it fits with the Enforcer which is more about overwhelming power than piercing through the limit methods of blocking it. It is a very limited effect when all is said and done.  Bonus Damage vs. Vulnerable Targets Again I like the idea but I think it would be better on a new weapon rather than the Enforcer. Some sort of dartgun or some such Sydney Sleeper for the Spy? Temporarily Negate Victims Damage Resistances This is what makes me think it should be a new weapon rather than a rework of the Enforcer. Id even go one step further and have it make the victim more vulnerable to damage allowing you to quickly weaken enemies out of your range so you allies can better handle them. You give up selfdefense in order to better assist your team. On such a topic should the Sydney Sleeper actually be a secondary weapon in your opinion like it was originally designed to be?Big EarnerI hear mixed messages on the Big Earner actually. While minor changes like you suggest would be fine for balancing it out I still think the Earner should be entirely reworked regardless due to the set its apart of showing a focus on combat at the cost of stealth. Its a case where Id rather its attributes be moved to a more aestheticallyfitting weapon really. Regardless of if it needs tweaking or not what do you think of the changes I did give it if I may ask?Kunai All weapons take skill true but skill shouldnt be able to overcome a weapons downsides. Thats my basic position on it. You seem to be a fair bit more seasoned than most Spy players if I may mention. Most find the weapon too difficult to use effectively and it doesnt exactly have a new purpose besides encouraging more aggressive play while I dont mind that I still stand by how I think its method of accomplishing that should be swapped with the Big Earner. Kunai would be fragile but stealthy and unable to overcome its downside while an Earner would help you be more durable but take away some of the knifes killing potential.  True my changes to the Kunai arent the best thought out as has been pointed out. I do want the Kunai to be a stealth dagger however. Perhaps only have it instantly cloak on backstab for a few seconds say  seconds while disabling your watches? It would allow you to attack to disable the cloak similar to the YER breaking disguise with attacks but the cloak would be very short lived. Meanwhile it could have the Big Earners movement speed boost allowing you do quickly move between players for the chainstab and escape. Still good for the aggressive play but more inline with ninja lore without being too overpowered as you gain incredible mobility and stealth on a backstab but are very fragile while in that situation and while trying to reach it. ,TF2WeaponIdeas,dbohyrg,1,t5_2vlc0
10346796,0,t3_5mv3a3,This fix reminds me of the Soda Poppers initial rework and it pleases me as Pyro is a class within dire need for extra mobility. This extra moving capability allows for fun times as the player using it and it isnt a slap in the face to fight against unlike today. Great rework overall.,TF2WeaponIdeas,dcgvadx,2,t5_2vlc0
10405382,0,t1_dcnhqg4, Glad we can agree there at least as for methods who knows? The debate on how they might be balanced will probably rage until HalfLife  comes out or Hydro is fixed.  ...May I throw a party in your honor Echo? That is probably the one thing I wish more people would consider when making weapons! Not just nerfing persay few weapons need complete nerfs. Most just need their downsides made a bit stronger to balance out their upside.,TF2WeaponIdeas,dcnimu0,2,t5_2vlc0
10964868,0,t1_deawkie,That does sound infuriating but its much better to act composed and persisting with your questions instead of beating insults and harassment into the person youre discussing with.

11194187,0,t3_5zs8ub,The Scatter gun can deal a solid  damage up close if you can hit all  pellets.  for a projectile is a lot of damage i may be wrong but i think that is about the largest amount of damage for any projectile other than the direct hit. I think this would have problems in that getting the first kill would be easy but the taunt would almost certainly lead to your death. You have a higher dps than the scattergun which has a high dps anyway but you are still really squishy.i think this would lead to a style of play that is getting an easy kill then dying while you taunt before repeating. which would be annoying for both people involved.,TF2WeaponIdeas,df0uj3a,2,t5_2vlc0

11459855,0,t3_63i7d9,I have different ideas on how to balance the Backburner myself one of which is a reduction in fronton damage.I think the Backburner IS already a great weapon  its possibly even my favourite weapon in the game especially since they nerfed the Combo Pyro. The main annoyance I have is that it only crits at a very small specific angle. I dont think it should crit at the full  degrees as Spys Knife does but the angle should be widened to at least  degrees or so.I love your idea about letting it synergize with the DetonatorScorchReflect Jump more and the increased airblast cooldown is actually a drawback the  airblast cost can be a pain on some maps but usually there are enough ammo packs where as long as youre sparing and actually try to flank around instead of running headlong at the enemy youll never really run out of ammo anyway.But as I said I very much disagree with the damage increase  the Backburner is currently known as the stereotypical WM newb weapon possibly to an even greater extent than the Phlog  which is sad because when its used intelligently it can feel very skillful and satisfying. IMO the noncrit damage should be reduced by a significant amount to discourage mindless WMing  it should be almost unusable unless youre actually trying to flank so that people dont choose the weapon just as a way to gain possible increased damage in facetoface fights.On the other hand as well as increasing the crit angle the crit damage should possibly also be increased or perhaps the afterburn from a crit particle should deal extra damage  because otherwise no matter how well you flank the weapon can be easily countered just by turning around quickly.In fact no offence intended but Im slightly bewildered that you think your idea will take more skill to use  if you ignore airblast as WM backburner Pyros already do then apart from the increased knockback stat the only change to this weapon is that it deals increased damage.If anything I think your idea would just encourage more people to use it in a brainless way  sure it would take a lot of skill to use as intended but then one of the major problems of the CURRENT Backburner is that most players use it just for the potentially increased damage instead of for its intended use so I dont think you can trust players to use your idea for anything more than an increased damage WM weapon. ,TF2WeaponIdeas,dfuytqa,1,t5_2vlc0
11631294,0,t1_dge25d8,I agree. The reason that I have the other two is because the TF Team does not seem to like to revert things to previous forms as there is always reasoning behind the changes that they have made so I decided to think up some ways where it can be balanced around having the Scout super vulnerable afterwords without being super vulnerable while under the effects of the drink as I think that this is how they will try to balance it in the future. ,TF2WeaponIdeas,dgef4bi,2,t5_2vlc0
11684308,0,t3_66mtxc,What do you mean can set any class on fire regardless of the circumstances? Are there fire items that dont set every class on fire? when you say under any circumstances do you mean you can light them on fire under water? Also why do mini crits if they dont do extra damage? And finally fire that cant be extinguished shouldnt be a thing just because it would cause a frustrating amount of wasted jarate mad milk and pyro ammo. It should do bleed instead because thats pretty much just afterburn damage that cant be extinguished.,TF2WeaponIdeas,dgkfma8,0,t5_2vlc0
