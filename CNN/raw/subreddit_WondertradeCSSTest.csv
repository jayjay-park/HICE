8933897,0,t3_52nfz4,I lack basic understanding of css but this is what Ive gathered from experience so far  It seems like css is read from top to bottom and thats why addons work the way they do.If the basic naut weve been using e.g tells the comment box to be blue I give it the same command in the addon and tell it to be yellow and it overwrites it. The end result is that its yellow.    It keeps me thinking that because sometimes on refresh of a page I can see things flashing up in a different color than they are in the end as if its working its way through the whole mess.    How wrong or not is my concept of this?        Its also worth mentioning that upon pasting back the code of the OLD WT css we started having the flair issue there as well even though it was working flawless before.,WondertradeCSSTest,d7lq0ka,1,t5_3gaaj
