2273848,0,t1_clscpb7,Do you mind giving a brief explanation?  Im fascinated by the weird connections between Boltzmann entropy and information entropy.  I understand the probabilistic nature of them but I havent completely wrapped my head around their connection in nature yet.  One thing that is particularly confusing to me is that Shannon entropy seems to increase when all microstates are equally likely but in Boltzmanns definition entropy increases with increasing states.  ,BradyHaran,clsrlsk,1,t5_2y59h
2367074,0,t1_cls5774,I do have a question.The way I understand it is that saying entropy will increase is a probabilistic assumption eg. there are many more ways for the balls to spread out through the room than there are ways for them to clump together in the box.But doesnt that also mean that there IS a chance that theyll clump together in the box and that entropy can even if highly unlikely decrease?,BradyHaran,cm4a2do,1,t5_2y59h
