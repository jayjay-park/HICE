4756266,0,t3_3g1xge,I havent played this matchup yet with new GP so take this with a pinch of salt.Id imagine the best thing to do in this scenario is just farm. Sounds lame but unless you get off a good barrel chain you cant really outtrade him since he can kitepoke better and even if you manage to get to him his blind stops you activating GPs passive.Get a Cowl early to negate a lot of his damage and just farm up. Your Q gives you safe farm and your ult gives a chance for free assists Or a lucky kill. You should be better than him in teamfights so Id suggest going cowl and trying to get a Trinity for mid game. Teemo unlike you doesnt have sustain. So one way which may be riskier but could work is to get a Sheen and just poke him out of lane or get him low enough for a gank. You could do a mixture of these go Cowl rush and then farm for your Sheen and begin the poke.,gangplankmains,ctu2mns,1,t5_38he7

8615032,0,t3_4xsdhu,well i stopped playing league exactly at the point of triforce change before gangplank became much more into the meta. and ever since i saw the PBE changes to remove crit chance i got pretty disappointed and wanted it to not go through. im not a fan of pen build and i only built it in certain scenarios only. and with the tri force changes with  percent crit chance late game if you land a barrel on enemy team and it does not crit you are basically fucked especially if u did  barrel combo. before i stopped playing i was WL with gp.edit i also think but thats just my opinion before tobias fate got famous on this subreddit and on league subreddit before the tri force changes. he used to run either  percent scaling cooldown or  percent flat and  percent scaling and so did i. but before not many people used to do that and got essence reaver for the cd. now no matter if u run cd runes or not or just  percent cd in runes........ you can easilly hit  percent cd which i think was the intention of riot. people didnt realize how good cdr was on gp.,gangplankmains,d6ih6fs,1,t5_38he7
8682306,0,t1_d6qpzsy,Alright finished watching the replay. Your greatest weakness lategame is that you do not set up enough barrels in their fog of war and your barrel proc is sometimes a bit too slow. You should also use your ult an AOE slow and your youmuus a speed boost to set up big double barrel connections. In one of the final fights you wasted your ult without using the precious aoe slow to connect another barrel to kill or at least for a flash on their front and backline. Lategame using Q to poke is also good. It is more reliable than using a double barrel and is barrel cheap. In one of the last fights you failed to connect a triple barrel and you were completely spent on barrels. Remember the cheapest triple barrel you can perform is setting up one barrel letting your cooldown return to  then placing  more. That way by the end of the combo you still have  barrel to spare which can be used alone or with a double barrel combo in a few seconds. Also gangplank is the strongest baron goalkeeper. You should punish every one of their facechecks and missteps with double barrel combos.,gangplankmains,d6qwvsd,1,t5_38he7

8724971,0,t3_4zfdui,I dont know what you guys are talking about with The nerfs did nothing Like your annecdotal Oh I got a penta after the patch really doesnt mean anything you were just better then those people. The only thing that really states how much power a champ has is statistics and statisitcally his winrate has nose dived from  winrate to  winrate after the patch. The nerfs hit hard and were very effective at slowing GP down. This sub is very emo and always thinks more nerfs are coming etc but GP was barely a thing in competitve before the nerfs just a game here and there he would see a pick or ban but usually ignored he was mostly too strong in soloq but he isnt good in soloq anymore either so he is in a good spot. As long as his winrate is at  there is no way he gets nerfed more riot follows stats very closely with nerfs GP is just going to be chilling now. Who knows maybe some item changes make him too strong again and he gets nerfed more but for the forseeable future no way he gets touched more he might even see a buff many many months down the road if they wanna see him played more again. But he should take a break for now been so much GP in the meta since his reworkThat site posts winrates very early and constantly updates what winrates are at for a patch much faster than champ.gg after a couple days it has high accuracy also and it has been a couple days. ,gangplankmains,d6w9hkp,5,t5_38he7

If you run up to cs a minion and he autos you make sure to q his face so you do not take free damage.If you are confident in your landing pattern and trading  start sapphire and go sheen cull. Gives sustain makes you out scale faster and your q will chunk his face way more than he does you. If not for and ring and practice  also use barrels. At  percent you can all in him just make sure that he doesnt blind your passive. Lead his escape path with barrel and colleCT free gold.Make sure not to get invisible cheesed. Get pink on first back and red trinket use it when all inning to disable shrooms.Vladimir isnt a big deal either. With sheen your q deals more. Just avoid crimson rush q and ultimately pool all in. If he ults b the fuck out asap and w to mitigate ult. Whittle with barrels. Either he ws and loses a chunk or barrels chunk lol.You out scale both.

10236029,0,t3_5mjmpd,more toplane gp mains so theyll tell you gp top is harder pfrom playing both id say gp mid is harder purely becuase of more ganks in the midlanes becuase theres more entrances to the jungle.  in mid  in top. Youll come across alot more ranged and poke champs in the midlane so laning is actually harder to get that juicy CS. GPs roaming potential is terrible early game especially when under level  so the advantage of midlane of being able to roam bot is pretty much nonexistant.I personally belive gp mid is more fun becuase it requires you to put in more effort as laning is usually harder however you get bigger rewards from being able to build like a midlaner and go a less defensive build.,gangplankmains,dc4b7ib,1,t5_38he7

10298329,0,t3_5neezr,Ok.  Your first build has heavy AD little atk speed one zeal item later on and  crit.  This is ok but it has some issues.  First it is stupidly expensive so unless you farm like a madman consistently you are going to ramp very slowly which can lose you games without ever feeling relevant.  A few key things can help fix this dont finish the Last Whisper item immediately.  If they are rushing armor enough to condone the item Tabi RandiunsZzRotSunfire then sure pick up a LW after Trinity but you dont need LDR or MR yet.  Instead start getting your actual damage modifiers like the mentioned IE.  Reaver is a quirky item on GP.  It will always make you overcap CDR as long as you have Trinity however the AD and Crit can be potent.  However it only gives  so instead you should go to get your IE then a Zeal item notably Shiv since it rounds out your Crit faster and improve your waveclearextended dueling.  Then you can go for the ER.  Now if your team is stacking Infernal Drakes go crazy with the ERs after your IE.  The added  AD is stupidly good for those items and makes you hit like a semi in comparison to a truck.  After this you can finish your LDRMR and then round out your build with whatever you need be it Lethality Durability another Zeal item or a second Reaver.    Second build is pretty much the same deal with the Reaver.,gangplankmains,dcbddlo,1,t5_38he7

10335789,0,t1_dcfg2i9,Actually a streamer can do whatever they want as long as they dont break the Twitch TOS. People like Tobias who interact with chat and banter with their viewers donations and whatever do so because they enjoy it they like making other people laugh and they want to share good gameplay. If he didnt care for making his viewers happy he could just not talk at all but he specifically tries to interact with his viewers even at the slight sacrifice of game quality which is why he sometimes goes off mic as it improves his gameplay and thats what he wants to provide to us  quality GP plays. Streamers make the effort to share their gameplay and conversation with the community but theyre not obligated to. Sure he mightve ended stream abruptly but he has that right to. Theres no contract that specifies he has to say goodbye before ending his streams or even a contract that says he needs to stream on a regular schedule. Streamers are still normal people. Tobias is still subject to the feelings of frustration and anger that we all experience when we get tilted. He has the right to turn off his stream anytime he wants.If you didnt like it then fine but dont come here whining about it. What does this accomplish? Stop watching him if you think hes rude.

11336389,0,t1_dfgst4n,I see Grasp of the Undying GP as a GP that wants to win lane. It easily gives the most damage early game for GP and provides the most early game sustain. I prefer to use this mastery vs tough melee matchups bc generally tough melee matchups are champions that do not scale well and have most of their kit tailored to winning the early game. Examples like Darius Renekton and Pantheon come to mind. If you start out damaging them in early trades or even just going even in trades your sustain and zoning potential can push them out of lane and if that happens you can really prevent them from coming back from a loss because you can stop them farming and zone them really hard. Although warlords still works very well and doesnt forfeit any late game damage like Grasp does its the easiest mastery to snowball off which is why its one of the more common Korean GP masteries because their games are more tailored to early game than other regions,gangplankmains,dfgykj6,1,t5_38he7

11410600,0,t1_dfogust,I second this.Still its about playstyle but boots in most of cases help out. I mean ish AD you get instead of boots usually dont make difference. When you combo someone and all in he surely dont get out with hp or so. It happens but how often just to risk boots and mobility for it... And in the end you have ult right.Im just here for opinions and ideas and you all gave me a lot of it. Thanks,gangplankmains,dfpdnrp,1,t5_38he7
11432360,0,t3_634s3m,I like the idea. The Jhin main sub already linked their sub in one of the corners. Unfortunately I have about as much artistic ability as you. The canvas is getting extended soon which would give us room as well. ,gangplankmains,dfruh5n,1,t5_38he7

11460075,0,t1_dftnv8o,Idk i dont struggle with Ori very much maybe the few ive met usually im top poked around a bit but got caught by a midgame engage with ult tld and barrel chain flash the shockwave into her to proc passive and usually get sums or a kill.Can confirm Cassio is annoying as heck thank god i didnt see one in ages anymore.,gangplankmains,dfuzq3m,1,t5_38he7

11574889,0,t3_656t5g,I may come back to add more to this but for the time being ill say this.Use your ulti first in order to signal the engage to your team and apploy a slow hence making barrels easier.Bruiser GP scales well just not as well as his Critplank or  counterparts. You become hard to kill and are a serious threat if left alone to split or stomp on carries just dont expect .k damage barrels.At higher elos Grasp with Korean Bruiser build is usually better top but Critplank or  is still entirely respectable and is usually better at low elo due to increased carry potential.Hope this helps just ask if you want me to elaborate on anything!,gangplankmains,dg80pye,1,t5_38he7

11603334,0,t3_65ktq8,If youre level  and you should have triforce by now you can throw a barrel in front of you at max range then run up to it and auto it procing your passive and phage passive for a big movespeed boost. ,gangplankmains,dgb8wxp,1,t5_38he7

11730241,0,t3_678end,Tbh... you dont need it. At all. As much as people are saying its good for chasing etc. You dont need it because how hard it is and it wont really effect outcome of games.Source  was talking to challenger gp main godrjsdnd,gangplankmains,dgpnj2r,2,t5_38he7

11794847,0,t3_68anp8,Its all dependant on the game. Youll learn to judge games and buy accordingly.  I will say right off the back Doran Blade tends to be more common in Manki Mangi? Bruiser GP. The health damage and lifesteal is helpful for trading in lane. Same goes with most defensive items Tabi Spectre Cowl etc...Full AD GP tends to want a sheen and cull on their first back. Since youre playing for the mid to late game you dont want to stall your build by getting items that dont build into TriGbIE or whatever your full AD build is. If youre getting camped to the point where you cant go to lane or even sit under tower without getting ganked then getting a defensive item is a good idea. Otherwise opt for anything that will get your build rolling. ,gangplankmains,dgwzi0b,1,t5_38he7
11796161,0,t3_67zbh6,I take exhaust for any matchups or jungler a that can burst me as it works for a great escape tool as well as something to save your team mates. Tp is good for managing back times and map pressure but I feel like your ult does a good enough job of that already.,gangplankmains,dgx4vcm,2,t5_38he7
