10880580,0,t3_5to5sm,Ive picked up thoughts from animals before but Ive never had an animal read and respond to my own thoughts not that I could tell anyway. The thing about the dog wagging his tail is quite surprising. I guess the explanation is that the dog could read your thoughts. We cant know for certain but I have had several experiences where I have read peoples thoughts and its happened with animals too so in my opinion that is a potential explanation. Maybe the shrooms helped. I think telepathy happens in the deep subconscious so maybe the mushrooms helped you get access to that part of your mind.,Telepathy,de2963h,2,t5_2sks9
