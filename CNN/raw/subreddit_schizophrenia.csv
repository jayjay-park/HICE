It is we both know it is but sometimes it can just suck. It pushes us to think of suicide. Do tell the pdoc about your suicidal ideations and tell them how you plan on it. Even if come Tuesday you dont feel that way anymore still do explain. I want them to fix you up. Youre somewhat different a trooper for sure. Most people are afraid of going inpatient Im glad youre one who understands what must be done. OK a bit of advice. There are things you can bring inpatient with you. Bring your favorite pillow. Bring your favorite comforter. Slippers or sandals if you have them. A few days worth of clothes. It wouldnt be a bad time to bring some books or magazines either. I dont know if youve been inpatient before but I cant think of how many times I wished I had some comfort items in my room with me at night. If you dont want to draw attention from your household about it then pack it up discreetly and leave it in your room somewhere for them to send it to you while youre in there. i hope things go better for you.

Partial blockage will increase the high though it would be impossible to completely block all of it as you wouldnt be able to function. I know that the more receptors you have the more dopamine that is needed to sustain a working network of neurons. You can have a ton of network but a limited amount of dopamine unless you give it time to create more but this leads to the risk of flooding your neuro network with too much which leads to psychosis. idk just my theory.I think the more you get high the harder it is to get the same high the second time around. its a tricky business with schizophrenia you either have too much or too little. When we have too little we tend to seek for more stimulant though it is too much most of the time. The problem with addiction. ,schizophrenia,cmu1jnf,1,t5_2r828

Left the airport went home smoked some urbz went to bed. Hours later parents call ...what happened to you...you did not show at the airport...? I told them what happened and that led to some realizations that my anxiety was also about them it took about  years until I got on a plane again to go visit them...I dont have plans to go back.So the plane was not doomed my anxiety about being packed in an airplane with all that human noise was justified though especially with all the toxic holiday stress spreading like a contagion.

I.e. someone helpfully suggests you can try some diet and in your head it becomes a cure nutjob or something. That would be delusional by my book. Have you ever read someone say you fool why are you even schizophrenic glutenfree can cure you? I guess not. It must have been more along the lines of what I am writing about right now in this post twisted into something it wasnt to begin with.Not everyone is like you. That some particular thing or all of the things didnt work well in your case just means that. No reason to assume that sane and potentially helpful things diet changes positive thoughts exercise healthy lifestyle are hopeless. They are options that lead to general improvements which do naturally also improve your mental illness with it.Getting even more into the less general and into more specific approaches you can look at diet changes. Eating differently is an option that is not dangerous it is not a huge effort or change to adapt to. Therefore regardless of whatever remote chance there is that any particular theory applies to you or even that the theory is sound you can try them and be happy if it works. If it doesnt bad luck. Look up research on ketogenic diets for example. I know someone who eats this now  and it just cured his hallucinations and most other symptoms. Doesnt mean that you are that person. Doesnt mean that it works for everyone. Doesnt mean that it is the schizophrenia cure. But foremost of all things it doesnt mean that you know what it does to you unless you have actually tried it. Whatever the fuck it is that makes it work brain parasites being starved of glucose or excluding weird chemicals for the chemicalsensitive whatever. The important thing is that it is an option that people can be aware of and it can help some of them. Given that they overcome their frustration and pessimism and try to actually do something to help themselves.So please if it doesnt work in your particular case then dont start to antagonize meaningful help for others. Just because you feel responsible or hopeless or left out. I dont know your problem. But if anything your post speaks of your frustration to not be able to improve your disorder. Antagonizing whatever it is that made it look like you can. ,schizophrenia,cwku2go,1,t5_2r828

6000466,0,t1_cy66qbm,Psychotic symptoms are like fevers. There are many many causes.To treat the fever one must treat the cause although in emergencies treating the symptom can be done to prevent brain damage. Psychosis is a symptom. It can be caused by drugs hallucinogenics Prednisone etc but it generally ceases with the drug use. It is in this case overheating caused by heat exhaustion. Remove the causefix the problem and the symptom goes away and hopefully no permanent damage was done.Mental disorders are not defined by causes. They are defined by symptoms and the treatment is focused on symptoms not causes.For example psychosis caused by carbon monoxide poisoning and Lyme disease can be treated by treating the actual problem.Schizophrenia on the other hand has no identified causes. It has a lot of research going into investigating it and there is no clear answer. But the symptoms occur and they can sometimes be managed with drugs. But these drugs are not treating the cause. They merely manage the symptoms somewhat. If a normal person took those drugs used to treat schizophrenic symptoms it could very well cause psychosis in the otherwise healthy person.,schizophrenia,cy66wpz,1,t5_2r828

6124540,0,t3_3zazw4,Ive had bad experiences dealing with labels. Right now Im diagnosed with Psychosis  N.O.S. Basically antipsychotics work really well on me but I experience full blown psychosis without them. My Mother and my twin brother have illness which I believe to be the same as me. I grew up thinking my mom had Bipolar. Thats what she told the family after she finally got on the right meds. In my first hospitalization I was told I had schizophrenia which was a shock to me. I thought for sure I had what my mom had. I didnt know much about schizophrenia so i was afraid to take meds for a couple days. When I finally did realize i needed meds they gave me risperidal which gave me bad side effects. My mom was and is now on Geodon. You would think they would try the same thing my mom uses. I ended up going back to the hospital after only a couple days. They even transfered me to another hospital for  days because i took mg extra because I didnt know I was experiencing side effects from the meds not my illness. They switch me to Zyprexa and i did get better during hospitalization. Back home I research schizophrenia and become convinced Its not what I have so I ask for my medical records from the fist hospital. According to them I had Schizophreniform. I learn this is a temporary diagnosis so I think maybe my illness was just temporary. It took several months but I worked with my doctor to taper off meds and I was successful till soon after I started having insomnia just like my mom does when she goes off meds. Because they labeled my mom as bipolar and me as scizophreniform it doesnt click for me to go back on meds. I asume I just have insomnia so they give me ambien for sleep. That works for a couple months till I end up back in the hospital. This time though only for two weeks. This time I demanded Geodon. It worked and I became stable but It gave me high blood pressure so Im back on Zyprexa. My brother became ill a year and a half later. He was put on Zyprexa initially. Now hes on Abilify. He has never been hospitalized. Mom has been diagnosed as bipolar and schizoaffective. Ive been diagnosed as schizophreniform schizoaffective and Psychosis N.O.S. As for my Twin I dont know and I dont care. Im just glad were all finally on the right meds and are really high functioning. I wouldnt mind it if labels could be used with genetics so that it was easy to know what meds to take but that is not the case right now.TLDR Mom and twins have same illness with same symptoms. We end up on different meds for different diagnosiss. ,schizophrenia,cylsok5,1,t5_2r828

Its incredibly difficult for me because its a very high standard with a lot of personal responsibility. I did restaurant work and its incredibly taxing and you are really at the whims of the personality of your superiors. Its hard for  someone with any problems.I several months trying for jobsquitting when they proved unworkable or without enough money mostly that. Unfortunately as someone said elsewhere in the thread the trend of work is the expectation of being willing to sacrifice yourself and your health for a job that probably isnt worth it. Food service and hospitality are especially like this where even you taking a day off can screw them over and puts so much pressure on your back. My last several jobs have been in both fields as is my current and even something like injury is still frowned upon if you needed to leave. Its hard for even a normal person. No one sympathizes though and it does really feel like theres something everyone else has that you dont vrcausr they all seem to be able to do it fine.Take it easy on yourself.. this stuff is incredibly incredibly hard. The fact that you have your job is good. I guess try looking for things like transcription if youre good at typing learn code on code academy if you can and you could take freelance work.

7660270,0,t3_4k7uq4,Agreed with the other poster. SZ is a complex disorder but a lot of it is increased stress reactivity and impulsivity which predispose to drug use. But the drugs only make things worse  both psychotic symptoms and also later withdrawalrelated issues  all puts your neurochemistry out of whack. I went to a psychiatric ward literally a week after a  month drug binge  didnt realise it at the time how related the two were but it made perfect sense when I realised how harmful the drugs were. Everyone there adolescent ward at the time had drug use as a preceding factor before they came in combined with stress. Ive had  thankfully brief psychotic episodes all accounted for by alcohol withdrawal and immense interpersonal stress. The best thing you can do for whatever disorder you have a lot of the psychotic disorders are now understood to overlap and are usually to do with some form of psychological stress andor lifestyle issues e.g. drug use malnutrition lack of exercise is to start considering your future self more than the current emotions that fuel your drug use  that is pursue deferred gratification and let your brain stabilise without drugs for a good long while while facing negative emotions and events with a clear head and less avoidance. Itll also help you cope better and approach real life problems much more competently and with less anxiety. In SZ there are often problems in the home or community  I know I had this only a year or so ago and I was on the brink of a psychotic break when I had exam stress drug use and family problems combined. If your family or friendscolleagues stress you out try to find ways to lessen the impact that has on you or make interactions less extreme with them. In any case ceasing drug use should be a first priority and it may be the hardest step. Good luck.,schizophrenia,d3cxglj,3,t5_2r828

7666756,0,t1_d3d2fbk,I know I sound stupid to a lot of people so try not to take it personally. I meant to express that there is a lot of environmental factors cultural bias and general ambiguity when it comes to the concept.gt The point is that there is extraneous information going to the frontal lobe that occurs in people with schizophreniaIs there any tests that a patient may take to prove this? The only studies Im aware of are on older patients that have already undergone treatment for decades. The only shred of evidence supporting this in practice is that certain chemicals work a certain way and patients report their lives become somewhat more tolerable . It doesnt address why the imbalance is there or why it affects individuals differently.gt Yes many of the negative symptoms and cognitive symptoms can be caused by other things. That is why those things have to be ruled out before a dianosis of schizophrenia is given.The process of trying to assign a diagnosis is a facade to make the patient feel comfortable undergoing treatment. What is the process for deciding a proper diagnosis? The psychiatrist gives you an assortment of drugs until heshe is satisfied with what you are reporting then you are diagnosed based on what the drugs are designed to do. Or you get similar drugs to what others before you reported. Ruling things out is a total shot in the dark and game of pin the tail on the donkey.gtGENETICALLY HERITABLEAll behaviors are inherited  it has very little to do with genetics and more to do with environment and development. How gene expression affects our behavior is entirely circumstantial due to social constructs and the nature of social animals.gtIn fact sometimes distinguishing between bipolar with psychotic features depression with psychotic features and schizophrenia can be difficult.Thats because its complete pseudoscience. We have to refer to them as spectrum disorders because we really have no idea what causes them or how to arrive at anything certain within a patient.gt negative symptoms like alogia aviolition anhedonia alexithymia apathy asociality anosognosia and flat affect.All of these can readily be contributed to personal preference or the environment. Failure to assimilate does not universally indicate defect and behavioral science intentionally overlooks this aspect of the debate. The core symptoms of psychosis are problems based in ontological qualia confused by rhetoric and disenfranchisement.gt Schizophrenia is not a magical insight into a special world it is a disease that separates you from all you love leaves you totally alone and unable to take care of yourself makes you suffer and steals your very essence from you. It is a very tragic disease that needs serious treatment not fetishization that glorifies delusions and hallucinations that are honestly imo terrifyingPlease understand that I accept the sentiment but I dont think there is anything definitive enough about the concept for it to be taken seriously other than the lack of alternative treatments or lifestyles. I honestly think you are doing yourself a disfavor in trying to break the fetish by supporting the definition the prognosis is that you get worse but the evidence is not clear. I think accepting a prognosis is not the way to happiness unfortunately.,schizophrenia,d3dnzvh,0,t5_2r828

I cant claim I relate to your situation but more to his...  I was taken out of work and put on disability for psychosis believed to be schizophrenia in  and were it not for my wifes and familys support Id more than likely be homeless right now.  Anyone who knows me knows Id never hurt a fly but the words psychosis and schizophrenia can stir a lot of fear in people it seems.  I wish I could give you advice that wouldnt involve him acknowledging the issue and seeing a doctor and Ive also been the one convinced I didnt have a problem and that medication was as far from necessary as possible.  It took a lot of fighting to get me to consider medication but an inpatient hospital stay really helped make it all more real helped it sink in that I really had to address the impact my differences were having on my life even if all I was willing to commit to was to disprove the idea that medication would improve my grasp on reality.  I saw it as poison that would change who I was.  Im just lucky there was someone there to fight for me to help me see that it was worth getting over my fear of psychiatrists and psychiatric medications.I hope upon hope youre able to convince him to see a doctor even if just to humor you as an act of kindness whether he has any faith it can help or not. The fact that hes got your support though means more than you may ever know.  It takes a lot of strength and patience to care for someone with a disability like schizophrenia and it says a lot about your character that youre so determined to find a way to stay together especially given the lack of support you have from friends and family.I hope youre able to find a solution and some support for yourself as well.

8913822,0,t3_52ahrt,It is already partly catched because you are aware you might have it.I think that in families with SZ some of their members dont like SZ diagnostics. Maybe its culpability dislike of doctors ...I think that if you can somewhat control your symptoms you can take the chance to avoid doctors and medicines. Dont get me wrong Im not saying they are useless. But I think that its always better and more efficient to deal with the problems by yourself if you can of course. I think medicines for SZ and alike dont fix the underlying problems. They just deal with symptoms. And if they are no more symptoms you cant fix the problem by yourself which mean you are then bound to takes meds forever.Also in my country psychologists cant deliver diagnostics. Only psychiatrists can. And even them can get the wrong diagnostic. But of course with what you are saying you clearly have something. But it could be something else than SZ. Anyway I think having a diagnostic is always a good thing because then you can fight the disease.Some tips that can improve your symptoms are  get good sleep eat wealthy do fitness dont do drugs and know yourself.In any way If you are in real troubles and distress go to doctors.

You dont know what your friends who took you in really think without asking and even then most people are too polite. I would just express my gratitude in as many ways possible offer to do work for them if you can. And on the SSI I receive SDI which is disability insurance. Prior to this I received private disability insurance through my former employer. I learned a lot about disability law and let me just tell you it is completely stacked in the favor of the insurance provider this includes social security. I had to hire a lawyer on contingency and build a solid case by documenting my medical issues well and also working with my lawyer to document third party medical opinions. It is more of a rule to expect that your case is denied. You may want to begin reaching out to lawyers now and get some advice. Make sure you keep a journal and calendar Keep notes and dates straight. It is very important. I successfully got my disability only to have it challenged at every turn and after  years the private insurance was cancelled. I do receive the SDI and fortunately I didnt need a lawyer I think because they were aware that a private insurance co. was paying the claim which leant credibility.

Or you said the lease ends at the end of October you can kick him out then unless hes contracted to stay longer. You also mentioned in a comment that you could get him out with the approval of the landlord maybe talk to himher about the situation.Regardless you are absolutely allowing him to walk on you take your money and time and disrespect you. You have no obligation to become his caretaker nor did you even realize that was what youre becoming. Its great to help friends out but he is not being helped hes just riding. You probably cannot provide him with the help he needs and he doesnt seem interested in accepting help...

9131481,0,t3_55bktn,Im not a psychiatrist just to clear that up. Im a registered nurse and I specialize in psychiatric care so theres a difference there. I can do some research about the xanax and psychoticparadoxical reactions and get back to you. From my experience and from what I recall from school and studying this stuff is that medication induced psychosis should clear once the meds are out of your system. The half life of xanax is about  hours so after stopping it would be effectively out of your system in  hours. For that to induce psychotic symptoms for  months seems highly unlikely. As far as quetiapine that particular medication has a blocking effect on dopamine multiple sertonergic receptors some affect on histamine and adrenergic receptors. So the reasons you may experience side effects could be numerous. All Im recommending is to be cautious and have a good reason to get off or switch meds. If its working for you keep it going.  months of psychotic symptoms is most definitively in line with a diagnosis of schizophrenia so my guess is that the xanax was more of a precipitating factor that induced a psychotic break. We see that kind of thing all the time. For example I see a lot and I mean a lot of meth and marijuana induced psychosis. When its drug related the symptoms clear in a week or less usually. But what is often the case is the drug was merely a catalyst for an underlying psychiatric illness. If the symptoms persist the fix is medications and medication compliance. I cant tell you how many repeat customers I get because they got stable figured they were good and then went off their meds to only fall back to being psychotic again and have to start at square one. One thing scientific research has shown too is that subsequent breaks are harder to get under control. The best prognosis for schizophrenia specifically is when people stay med compliant keep a good support system and keep up therapeutic relationships with a prescriber and therapist. So I cant diagnose your specific issues with those two medications. Technically I cant diagnose at all from a legal perspective. Im just trying to offer you a perspective from someone who has seen a lot of people with schizophrenia and a lot of psychiatric issues. One thing to keep in mind that one of our psychiatric docs told me one time. He said the diagnosis isnt that important weather its paranoid schizophrenia catatonic schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder or bipolar with psychotic features etc. What the docs try to do is match signs and symptoms with medications known to be helpful for those specific signs and symptoms. If someone shows a lot of positive signs of schizophrenia there are meds for that. If they have predominantly negative symptoms theres meds for that. If there is an obvious mood component there are meds for that. Unfortunately its not an exact science we have a lot left to learn. This is why its so important to be honest with your prescribing docs. They will be happy to make changes and find meds that work for your or a combo that works for you. But  months of psychosis... Ive not ever seen that caused by meds. Not even methamphetamines and other illegal drugs. Arm chair quarterbacking here I highly suspect that you do have some form of mental illness. And like the doc said who cares what the title is we need to find the fix and I would bet my left nut that going off meds is not the fix for long term. Another analogy I love is this. If youre a type one diabetic youre deficient in your ability to produce insulin. Its a lifetime problem. You cant just take insulin for a year then be good to go. No one with diabetes would even try this. But for some reason mental illness people have such stigma they place on themselves so they want to be off meds and be normal or whatever. Well what the fuck is normal anyways? Schizophrenia is a lifetime illness with no cure but like diabetes it does have effective treatments. Youre normal. Youre like everyone else with some sort of chronic illness. Why not stay the course? Why not accept that you have an illness. Its not a bad thing to have an illness right? You dont judge a diabetic for taking insulin right? So please dont feel like theres something weird or wrong with taking an antipsychotic. You just have a sick organ that happens to be your brain where a diabetic has a sick organ it just happens to be their pancreas. Anyways Im getting hella long winded and I hope that this helps you make a decision. The best advice and everyone here has said it is this communication with your doctor if you like himher be open and honest. Psych docs in my experience are some of the kindest and best in the doctor world. In med school they made a choice to go into a lower paying very difficult field because they were passionate about it. They tend not to have the ego and doctor complex bull shit you see in cardiac surgeons and what not. They went into this field because they want to help people like you. So in the end my advice is be open be honest and trust your doctor theyre on your side. Best of luck amigoa,schizophrenia,d89hblf,1,t5_2r828

I only occasionally have any issues with Schizophrenia probably thanks to the medication Im on.  I dont mind taking the medicine but sometimes I forget it and the symptoms are actually quite present with or without it in some respects but they dont bother me.  I realize that the medication can only do so much and I would really like to get rid of all the symptoms that the medicine does nothing for even if they hardly bother me at all.  I see faces appear in the air hear voices feel the touch of something invisible have some ideas of my own thoughts and actions influencing people I havent ever seen before and stuff like that.  So I have several symptoms that are identical to when I was first admitted to the hospital which was years ago.  The only one I dont have is paranoia about my family.  And since the medication does so little even though the problems are really not a bother I am trying to find a way to cure the symptoms that doesnt rely on medicine since the medicine is not very effective.,schizophrenia,d8arhwj,1,t5_2r828

I went from eating  calories a day to  with very little hunger.  Ive also lost about  pounds and working on another  to  idk yet.Some people find water fasting a bit fanatical or stupid its not just starvation.  It was a purification and spiritual practice for thousands of years.  People usually do it once a year or so for  days if they can.. Ive only made it  days on water and protein liquids.  I had a psychotic episode. Our understanding of the human body is horribly wrong or a lie as well... We do not need to eat  square meals a day or even eat every day... The human body can sustain itself on water alone for several weeks to months at low intensity...

Its typically accompanied with huge holes in memory as well.If anything it sounds like this student might have something closer to the autism spectrum if they have a disorder at all.

If shes creating new fake accounts can you lock down your Facebook so that only people whove friended you can message you?  Im assuming this is over Facebook.  If its another social media Im not sure how the privacy of those work.See if you can block her phone number too.  Your phone should have a way to do that.  And definitely report her to the police.  Perhaps bring your husband and that friend along to collaborate what youre saying.  I dont think that reporting your sisters outright harassment is going to put her child at risk but I can understand that fear.  I feel like your sister continues to stalk you because she knows she can and knows that you dont want to report her.  Start keeping a written record of every single time she contacts you.

11239124,0,t3_60dpmo,Disassociation is one of the hardest symptoms for me to describe. Its like going into auto pilot mode. When I try to remember what it was like to be in that state I can only think of alien. Like I was walking through my neighborhood last night and it was like I had never seen anything on this planet before. I couldnt recognize or label objects and everything was fascinating. But I didnt realize this at the time because I had also forgotten all words and thus could not think in words while it occurred. But just because I couldnt think in words does not mean I cant have a memory or a complex thought.  snapped out of it when I received a text message and realized I hadnt turned to start heading toward my house yet I walked well past my street.I told my boyfriend and he was scared. I said I had wandered lost like that for hours before but I usually get pulled out of it. Thats why a service dog is so good for me because they can bring me back to the present moment anytime I can only go auto pilot when I dont have something dependent on me for the most part  I still do walking the dog but its harder in a store where I have to keep the dog on task too.I have disassociated during conversations. This usually happens when someone says something that stresses me out or overwhelms me. My mind goes very blank and I have amnesia for a few minutes. I noticed the last time this happened in therapy a few days ago. When I started to come out of the episode I first recognized the word arm while staring at my therapist. It took me a few minute to remember what an arm was and that it was connected to a torso that made up a human... and its like everything comes flooding back.Very weird experience. Its like having the virgin mind of a baby for a few minutes or even hours. I just dont recognize anything but I also dont have the ability to realize I cant recognize in that state.

11551817,0,t3_64v119,Im a huge drug user and have had this condition for paranoid schizo  years. From reading your passage however I would really recommend not taking any recreational drugs. You say youre on top of everything right now and its not really work the risk of compromising that for the chance of a good time. You say you want to connect with people well the best way to do that is to relearn it. So little things to start with making actual conversation with your cashier if someone asks you about your day never say good or if you do say why. Doing all these small things with lots of different people is a great way to learn your baseline or wherehow you feel comfortable interacting with people on a day to day basis. Also you can learn from every encounter as in what is good and whats not. Ive found making myself interact with people I used to try and ignore cashiers people walking past on thee street has made me much more outgoing and now I constantly get people telling how much of a good personfriend I am which is totally mindblowing considering how I used to behow people used to be about me.

11648935,0,t3_6681gd,I have difficulty cleaning because its like actively reenacting trauma from childhood. Sometimes during this I hear my abuser talking to me. I know its memory or hallucination but it makes things very difficult.Most of the stuff that hurt me in the past has been taken over by a specific one of my auditory hallucinations so its him repeating stuff theyve said but in this instance its like Im in the same room with my abuser and the situation is occurring again.So.. I take breaks. I guess Im just letting you know it happens to me too. Its very unusual most of the time my auditory stuff isnt attached to reality or real people at all but it does happen and when it does things get much more stressful.Your experience could be PTSD too. When people have been through trauma its hard to say exactly where and why memories of it force themselves to the front. At any rate take a break do whatever you can to quiet  drown out  distract yourself from the auditory stuff help yourself feel safe. Im sorry thats happening. I hope it goes away soon! A good last resort for me is falling asleep while listening to music on headphones that usually does a soft reset for my brain.,schizophrenia,dggf5sx,1,t5_2r828
