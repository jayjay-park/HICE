17228,0,t1_cefpohw,I play at night for about  hours from amish.  That would mean gaming through night cycles  times a week unless my math is off.  Next week  day cycles.  Id rather experience both a day and a night cycle in one play period instead of being stuck in the same cycle for essentially  hours of game time straight because each of my  hour periods would occur at night during the week. I dont see what is wrong with a  hour cycle or why it sucks.  More to the point I just get annoyed when people complain about every little piece of information we get.  This dude is complaining about a  hour cycle and his only argument against it is he prefers something else.  What is wrong with a  hour cycle?  Ive stated why I think a  hour cycle would be lame although I would get used to it and honestly probably completely forget about it once I start playing.  ,EQNext,cege874,1,t5_2saln

All started OK but eventually started having driver failures blue screens artifacts hard locks etc a year or less into ownership. This was after many many hours of personally troubleshooting each one. When I was fed up and ready to replace my  I remembered the last really great card I had a Radeon .

55354,0,t3_1upv0c,To me World of Warcraft initially felt cartoony but after a while it felt like I was truly in a fantasy world. Like the annoying window reflections on a TV screen that your brain cancels out after a while the unrealistic graphics become something that you dont even think aboutyou soon truly feel part of some fantastical dreamlike ancientmythical world in particular to me the night elf areas like Darnassus were enchanting. See Then there are more realistic games that perhaps feel more epic and grandiose.I think Everquest Next has a nice mix of both. The landscapes are vast and epic enough to feel real like the type of grand vistas were used to seeing in real life but the brushstrokey and loosely detailed art leads to a fantasywhimsical storybook feellike a loose foggy recollection of long past centuries and millennia. From what Ive seen of the art and graphics I feel like one could easily get immersed in the new Norrath because of the balance it strikes between fantastical and realistic.As a side note if they add in realistic ambient sounds and wellfitting music it would do a lot to make the game feel more realistic and immersive despite its somewhat unrealistic cartoony feel.,EQNext,cekqctc,1,t5_2saln

70502,0,t3_1uw3rm,I think many are missing the point of the presentation.The gist is that however innocuous it may seem the design of the game has to change to cater selling a product while the product is being used and experienced and that the relationship between audience and creator changes because of this.The analogy and example of a TV series not being able to use a mini movie format because one has to account for commercials being interjected every  minutes causing abrupt breaks and thus the design and storyline has to change to accommodate this is glaring in a game such as SWTOR which was ostensibly not designed for FP.This is where you get such hilarious juxtaposed offerings and content locks as paying  for each action bar more than the default  or paying to display titles you earned.EQ and EQ have gone through iteration after iteration to arrive at what is a fair presentation of offerings but the games have changed dramatically albeit not exclusively from FP.EQNext will be the first FP EQ franchise game specifically designed for FP and while I do not expect a fiasco such as Mass Effect  with day  DLC it will be interesting to see how it is handled.So far with the exception of limited AA points in EQ SOE has the best FP offerings that are the most fair and impede the games play the least. I expect much of the same with EQNext.However I am not naive and I do understand that it does in fact change the way that the game is designed and that choices have to be made such as which armor set drops off of bosses and which are appearance only and purchased through the cash shop and that this limits what can be produced as more resources are used and or more content is produced and thus quality may suffer.,EQNext,cemgesc,2,t5_2saln

I dont know what MOBAs youve played but from what weve been shown and what weve been told I expect EQNs combat to be pretty similar to Smite actually.Its FP game with a lot more game modes than most MOBAs have.

99321,0,t3_1v87nx,so the obvious question remains.  How are they going to bring social interaction to the player economy?  Some Modern concepts like the auction house implemented in most games involve zero social interaction.  Even the bazaar model where you set up a merchant to sell your wares involves very little social interaction.  The closest thing to social interaction I have seen is the East Commons tunnel in EQ... not a modern concept.  In fact social interaction within the economy is an ancient concept dating back to the time when nomads traded animal furs for pottery bowls.  Modern concepts involve removing any form of interaction from the economy...think Amazon.com and the like.  There seems to be a conflict in what they are saying.,EQNext,cepqktj,10,t5_2saln
100209,0,t3_1v87nx,I think for the healthiest economy possible the only thing you should be able to acquire through normal adventuring gameplay should be raw materials and that anything functional should require player crafting. Additionally there should be no such thing as loot drops from npcs only resources that players can deem valuable or not. ampnbspIn place of coinvalued drop loot being sold to NPCs as the source of the playertraded gold players should receive coin for doing tasks that actually advance the NPC world so to speak such as helping complete the big global changing questlines helping npcs in random encounters or routing out procedurally generated bosses from their lairs and essentially stealing their accrued coin. This greatly limits the influx of raw coinage put into the game and evens the playing field for new players entering the economy compared to old players as simply ones ability to slay an endlessly respawning slew of critters would not yield any tangible economic gain other than what resources they yield and their value would then be determined by the player economy. Thus the only way gold enters the economy strictly speaking is through controllable adjustable methods while it could freely exchange hands in the player economy through trades and payment for services.ampnbspLastly regional markets and the laborious and risk induced transport of goods via carts  trade caravans with procedurally  generated threats that scale to the amount of goods being transported with various abundances and scarcities of certain resources from one region to another would add an additional layer of depth and player interaction ie hiring extra escort guard players.ampnbspIf you combine all these systems you limit the influx potential of coin provided benefits for engaging other players in the economy and create a functional trade system in which all participating players benefit.,EQNext,cepu88c,3,t5_2saln

621562,0,t3_2183q3,As best I can tell class in EQNL is a matter of  weapon selection allowed armor a set of skill slots offensedefensemovementutility in some order and a set of skills to fill those slots.Those skills though will be balanced separately from classes as if my  class slots are DDOU I can use ANY defensive offensive or utility spkill not just the ones from my current class.  So all defensives will have to balance out all offensives utilities movements etc.  Class wont affect them really.Which leaves weapons armor and the pattern of skill slots to a class.  I think these will basically break down to the role the devs want the class to play tanky clases will have more defense dps classes more offense healerbuffer classes more utility and mobile classes more movement slots.  Same issue with weapons.  Grade x weapons will do a certain amount of damage based on the class formula probably such that class weapon a is better in one kind of role and weapon choice b is better in a different role.  Think handed hammer vs. hammer and shield.  In this setup the allowances of armor are obvious tanky classes get more dpsy classes less.In short when you break down the different elements class balance shouldnt be that difficult.  There will always be complaints especially looking at the progression Class A gets power X at level  which is vastly better than power Y that class B gets at level .  But if powers X and Y are balanced among others of their type I dont expect SOE to do much.  They might reorder the powers in the progression of the class but in the grand scheme of things it doesnt do a lot.TLDRI dont think its as bad as you think it is.,EQNext,cgax7k7,1,t5_2saln

680930,0,t1_cghnuvy,I have not kept up  on the details but I dont think you really do need to know every inprogress detail to want something new from an MMO.  No matter if youre grinding EXP or tiering up there will be some sort of reward for doing quests  introductions to new NPCs product availability equipment.. my point was just so long as its fun it doesnt matter to me if it flows perfectly from one area to another.  Id be fine just getting lost in an area having fun  not knowing if Im getting a piece of bread or a new sword from my task.  Eventually people will certainly figure it all out and thats fine.I really dont think traditional quest hubs would fit which is why an alternative is necessary.Im not even sure the original EQ method holds up all that well.Dynamic quests would be perfect and I think thats what theyre working on.  I read a bit about their AI engine and how it was capable of sort of generating quests with NPCs.  Been a while since I read it  they bought the rights to use some new software a company is working on specifically to create their quests.  I think its Emergent AI  StoryBricks where the NPCs will have needs and be able to hold limited dynamic conversations related to those needs.Edit Whats unfun to me is that interaction doesnt matter.  I realized testing ESO beta that I just stopped reading quests entirely.  Its the same rubbish all that really makes an impact is which sword or cape to pick at the end.  It just takes so long for whats always a subpar story.  EQ was really the only game where I actually cared about what NPCs had to say because there was actually the potential that it would make a difference.   It helped that EQ was before the era of mainstream Google you were a pioneer unraveling these mysteries.The quest system as I understand it in EQN will work similarly and there will always be more to do and if you screw up lots more NPCs to find and start over with.

Gaining DF wasnt a simple task and required the efforts of the many over time even if it was a zerg there was still some strategy needed.When DF would change hands a group would be ready to rush in and kill the other realm that was already in there and of course they were ready for a fight as well to stay in as long as possible.

I think SOE have learnt that the hard way with Landmark as theyve had a marked dropoff recently because of the time folks have already had hands on with it so early in the development process. Judging by how many articles alone were posted about Next on its reveal SOE wont have to do a whole lot to build up the hype train to breakneck speeds anyway.

1248681,0,t1_ci9n0xj,I agree with this post and the OP doesnt really have evidence on his side but that being said... I think the MMO crowd could be ready for a sandbox game the problem will be introducing them to it correctly. A huge majority of people trying EQN wont be someone who started like EQ like I am.However as a person who loved WoW I played in the beta until about WotLK I feel themeparkgeargrind MMOs are dead at least for me. EveryQuest had a feeling of kind of danger and ... the ability to be WAY away from everything out in the wilderness and ... discovery and... like you really had to LEARN where things were.WoW did bring some huge convenience and quests gave meaning to a game that in EQ could feel kind of pointless... but I remember sitting above the zone outside the Black Citadel after coming back to WoW for like a month and then leaving and looking down from my flying mount. Everywhere were stupid NPCs mindlessly pathing like a farm of hitpoint containers. I knew there was some scripted content in the zone that I could follow but the whole landscape and area felt... hollow. Small.I knew I could just fly wherever I wanted or take a Gryphon and forget about it. I knew where every cranny of the place was since Id flown it and it was on my map.There really were no surprises. No MOB was out of the level range no NPC could be out of place the transitions in the phasing would guide me to the correct quests etc.I had no desire to explore or strike out on a journey. It was just busywork until end game where you could either fight prescripted bosses or grind PvP to get better ingame items so you could beat people. As directionless as EQ sometimes felt apart from chasing better gear levels or AA... WoWs model was restrictive and is now worn out due to over curating the path people can walk and what can happen in the world.Next really hinges on the AI. If the AI is fantastic or even much better than the current MMO AI then things will be good and we can reclaim the few GREAT parts of EQ.

A combination of fantasy noir superhero with shifting and unclear objectives actual puzzles immense character customization and changing. Space battles that effect ground combat simgle player fighters in dog fights and trying to stop landing shipspodsrifts from delivering reinforcements multiplayer run ships working on collaboration.

They can bench over  lbs and squat  or   and those arent even HIGH numbers! Many of them can also run . times in the  yard dash. They are agile and have incredible control of their bodies.Saying that muscular people cant really wield a weapon well is simply ridiculous! What your body is capable of is in direct proportion to how you train it.Lets get more specific. Brock Lesnar. Yes he was a professional wrestler... but he was also a collegiate wrestler and a UFC heavyweight champion who defended his title multiple times!Professional athletes  which a medieval warrior was as many of them trained on a daily basis and their fitness level was what kept them alive  completely disprove your little blurb here.Big muscles have literally nothing to do with athleticism agility or coordination. NOTHING. The only time big muscles negatively affect those kinds of things are when an amateur does it to themselves.You see nearly every muscle in the body has an opposing set of muscles  biceps v triceps pectoralis v latissimus and so on. If you were to massively overdevelop your biceps while not doing anything to increase your triceps strength it could be a problem but this is nearly impossible for anyone who studies any kind of martial art to do  and if were talking combatants at this level martial artist is the correct term.Quit just making stuff up because it backs up your point. it makes you look silly.,EQNext,ciuq3kk,3,t5_2saln

Yes Curt Schillings was my boss haha I worked as a environmental artist but I havent been in the industry since . As for your qualifications good luck on your endeavors its a brutal industry lol. If you need contacts in the industry let me know. I have a close friend who works at Carbine and theyre hiring atmBut on to your point you are correct that first person is easier there is far less variablesissues that can impact playability your main issues lies in graphics and environmental effects needing to be top notch to immerse the user within the gaming experience. so agreeing with your point on object placement etc. This is actually why most early MMOs were primarily first person such as EQ etc.  For rd person if you have an excellent looking character with great animation and the camera correctly pansavoids being blocked by obstacles it can work well and let the user scrutinize less on the graphics within the environment. FPS games IMO require top notch graphics nowadays to be at the top using rd person that has been well executed can offset this somewhat.Typically in game development a story based on exploration games which again in my humble opinion is the nature of MMOs suit the rd person viewpoint much more because you can see the main character and the camera allows much more awareness of what is going on around you. See Mass effect Tomb Raider Uncharted WoW SWtoR Wildstar etc.In firstperson you want to make aiming and immersion the primary goals. See HalfLife first person shooters etc. I played Mortal Online an MMO and it was only FPS and loved it. But Ive also played some games which are FPS which I hated as the camera and movement didnt seem right. This is why I dont like the idea of st person MMOs unless their is a focus on tactical aiming and combat it doesnt feel right. If there is no aiming necessary if hitting a target is still based on RNG it seems pointless to me. again my opinion EQ worked but it would be considered a antiquated system at this pointHowever we come to your last point gtAnd then you say it would be so hard to play in that view when you are losing so much I grew up playing FPS and later Played EQ. To me I find first person completely natural. I dont think I should be able to see what is behind me without turning around. There were only a handful of times in EQ where I felt like I needed that extra awareness and it was only a mouse wheel spin away. I could zoom out and use that to skirt by enemies agro range and then zoom back into first person. EQ was perfectly functional and worked just fine in third person and I knew a few people that played that way. But the game was built for first person and so the world felt right from that view as well.We will just have to concede that this is purely a matter of opinionpersonally I prefer rd person I feel it offers a wider range of strategy and tactics and allows more flexibility than st person Im not saying its better. My whole point is that EQN will be rd person focused and thats the entire point of this threadspeculating the game should of been st is foolish its done all we can hope for is that st person isnt a blown off after thought we can see that from early builds and even Landmark. I see no problem in offering a good first person mode but I dont believe it will be anything more than a courtesy that wont be very popular because nowadays rd person is done so dang well. ,EQNext,ciuv7wc,8,t5_2saln

Due to having no access to teleportation it is quite a journey to go and purchase the extra two that you are permitted. Plus you dont have the real world time to do both. So because you are on your own and you only have a single WWA vial you decide to take your most powerful sword...According to the map the foot journey should take  minutes. Along the way you pass some interesting natural scenery. You collect some fauna some copper ore and you engage in a conversation with somebody coming in the opposite direction. The stranger explains that a pack of migrating creatures is in the area and to watch out because he was also attacked and had to flee. Following the same route you stumble on the creatures and a battle ensues. After wasting far too much time fighting the creatures and with only  minutes remaining until the destination your Mum shouts you down for dinner... What should you do? Will you spend a few minutes digging yourself into the side of a hill and hiding or do you use that precious vial? Well youre Aunties coming over for dinner with your cousins it could get late. You may not be able to log on until tomorrow. Therefore you opt to be safe and quickly decide to use the precious vial. You find a good spot in the bushes you take a quick look around for anybody watching realizing youre miles off the beaten path and therefore safe you promptly drink the vial... ZIP... you shrink down to a small innocuous shroom. Logout is now enabled.Well dinner was quick your Aunt and Cousins left fairly soon youre eager to enter the game again. You don the VR headset and upon partial log in you see from the perspective of the shroom that you have safely changed into. A quick look around you dont want any nasty surprises unfortunately reveals a flying creature which is known to have the power to locate and stalk WWA vial users. The creature is circling its waiting for you to fully log in and then it will attack. This type of creature has been known to circle for up to  minutes. You decide that you cant wait for it to move on besides you have your sword... You activate the full log on and the battle commences. They are stubborn creatures which periodically attack and then fly away. This one stalks you all the way up to your mission destination.Realizing that you cannot continue with this thing hovering around you stop to finally finish it off! Before you have time to regain yourself the guardians of this precious resource are on there way to fight you. Your battle with the creature was noisy and had alerted a front line spotter. The information about your arrival had been relayed back and a large hoard was quickly approaching. Despite putting up a good fight the hoard finally over powers you. The sword and other artifacts that you have so preciously guarded for all this time lie strewn around your broken bleeding body. An angelic sound is heard and a warping colorful tunnel propels you away from the scene. Empty handed and partially naked you materialize back in your quarters. Was it a dream? Checking your inventory reveals your precious missing sword. Right now the creatures you fought are transporting your belongings and distributing them into treasure chests throughout the kingdom. The sword that kept you out of harms way for so long will one day be uncovered by somebody else in some other part of this frustratingly absorbing world.,EQNext,cj21yvf,1,t5_2saln

I would also like to see them make macro sequences for Landmark allow players to control fight as the NPCs and record it. Nothing better than fighting a boss that can fight like a player. Give the NPCs an option tree using the best macros to choose from...  Not perfection but a damn hard fight...  just an idea. The real thing for me will be that such raids arent going to be static one place one mob repeatable affairs.

Now that been said I do believe that very high standards of work should be rewarded but if people enjoy doing this for free I cant see an issue with all of this stuff been used.At the end of the day they know the deal. If they do not believe it good enough for there time they can simply stop and while that is a shitty reason  if they have fun building it that can be enough reward in and of its self.I honestly just cannot see a fair way in which they could be compensated really unless they were allowed to sell the plans for what they built which I believe is a thing? for real money similar to how other games allow community generated content to be sold.I honestly struggle to see any real arguments against it. People like doing it it adds content to the game that does not drain resources everyone basically wins.

There are players who may dislike FFA OW PvP but the popularity of PvP games obliterates that of PvE games in the online gaming world. The numbers are staggeringly in favor of PvP games or games where the majority of the content is PvP.The key isnt catering to people who dont want to PvP I believe but offering them PvP options that are simply better than what is available on the market now.That said once again I dont really care that much if the carebears get their noses out of joint. This idea is aimed at an optional rules set server at least initially. While I do think it would be awesome and have a chance to be wildly successful if all servers used a system like this Im realistic enough to realize that SOE would likely never do something like that because of the exact reaction you seem to be having which is this the word PvP is in it so it HAS to be bad.,EQNext,ckyn0e3,4,t5_2saln

2328059,0,t1_clyiip1,Minecraft isnt an RPG. Yes its very simple and youre right battles are quickly resolved but it was an example of there being hidden stats and it not mattering.Regardless it seems like a lot of the equipment in the game has a heavy weighting on how they affect the abilities rather than necessarily stats. Stat comparison can be one of the most boring parts of a game particularly an MMO. At the same time so can being stuck with the same weapon the entire game.My point was more that this is an example of how weapons can be rated without players given specifics. For example maybe maces are slower but hit harder swords are balanced daggers hit for less but faster. And on top of that a material system or such for grading their value how much damage they do etc. While gear may not be a driving factor in the eyes of the devs the second you put stats on it they will be driving factors. Players cling to things that give them a clear tangible benefit and will go searching for those things over any story you would be capable of telling.Stats and precise specific information is at a direct opposition of immersion and story driven gameplay more so in an MMO than in other games. If you give a player a choice of saving the town for money or going into a cave to get a new item I think most will just go for the item the town can be rebuilt especially after they have that cool new sword. In a pen and paper rpg where I higher weight is put on roleplay and on persistence and dynamic things the town will likely come first but in a pen and paper rpg theyre also never told the rewards theyll get for the quest another example of secrets unnecessary knowledge kept from the players. ,EQNext,clzgly0,1,t5_2saln
2452781,0,t1_cmel68f,What if the Giant sees you as you follow? Whether it ignores you depends on what the Giant Wants and how that specific Giant feels about your gender your race your equipped class and any Organization you appear to belong to. The Giant might attack or it might start up a conversation with. That also depends on your general reputation.If the Giant is in search of foodgold it depends on how Giants in general and how that Giant in particular like to obtain foodgold. We know that Orcs specifically like to obtain gold by ambushing travelers on welltravelled roads. If there are too many guards patrolling the road the Orcs will move to a better location. If travelers stop frequenting that road because its too unsafe the Orcs will move to a better location.We dont know how Giants like to obtain food or gold or if they tend to see random strangers as desirable sources for those resources.I I wanted to be friendly with a Giant I would follow it using Stealth until I could determine what it Likes or Wants and how I could help him achieve that. If thats by killing a pack of Goblins that attacked the Giant yes that is likely to make the Giant thankful and start the path to building a positive relationship with the Giant. Will it erase negative faction? I guess that depends on how much negative faction youve built up.What if the Giant doesnt train you to be a Warrior? Most likely the Giant isnt going to train you to be a Warrior. All NPCs have more complex drives than kust KOS and looking for something to eat.

2822471,0,t1_cnofbmk,Exactly. Right now my favorite build in landmark even though its rather simplistic at the moment is a rogue tank build. I have a heavy armor set that when you crit will generate a shield on you. Then also on crit I have two trinkets that both create shields. The rest of my armor is crit based heavy armor and this creates a VERY effective tanking ability. SO I combined that with the daggers for maximum crit speed and I havent died since. Now imagine those elements combined to any class. Instead of a rogue i could be a mage tank and I could find modifiers to allow crits to add both mana and shields and find a classweapon that does fast AoEs for maximum crit chances in PvE. The crits arent that powerful but I regen shield and mana very quickly compared to classes with just dps buffs allowing me the ability to last WAYYY longer in a fight. The combinations are endless you just need to find the right armortrinketsweapons and combine those with the right class and you should be able to create about any style of combat you can think of. Youre only issue I could forsee is trying to find the right Look you envision as your most desired class as there are a limited amount of classweapon combinations. But again....this isnt limiting combat mechanics but just visual flavor which in actuality doesnt really matter. And trust me. Even though the majority of combat is on the mouse in Landmark its already tons of fun and I only have  abilities. Imagining  abilities already seems overwhelming haha. So I say dont worry about it. As long as there is enough diversity in gear abilities granted at launch we should be golden...if not just come back when there is since they will be adding more pretty frequently. ,EQNext,cnowpvj,3,t5_2saln

Currently k on reddit and k watching on twitch. I have a feeling a decent chunk of complainers havent even played the game yet. It is what it is and people will either get over it or move on. Not like this is the st game of this kind to have a huge number of fans then haters then empty spots where they used to be. I believe the game will speak for itself if airdrops take away all the fun SOE will adjust or not. Players will respond accordingly. Nature of EA and gaming.,EQNext,cnrozhg,-1,t5_2saln

Then when I heard everything was destructible i was excited until I saw a sword take out a stone wall etc etc. To me it seemed like a poor twist on how I think it should be done seems more like false advertisement that a truly destructible environment.

3091187,0,t3_2vkb6n,Statement from Daybreak quoted in originalgtAs part of a strategic decision to rationalize the business Daybreak Game Company announced today that it will eliminate positions in both its San Diego and Austin studios. This alignment of resources better positions the newly independent studio for future growth opportunities and developments including delivering on its legacy of making top online games and establishing a solid foundation for future multiplatform success. These reductions will not affect the operation of current games and the company will continue on its mission to partner with its player community to drive the future and push the boundaries of online gaming.Emphasis mine. Translation Big budget projects are all dead were now focusing on easiertomonetize platforms like mobile I suspect.

The unpredictable nature of combat and focus on large tactical fights rather than killing  rats mixed with the random chance for extra monsters showing up and other fun stuff that can happen over the course of the mission adds serious replay value.  The genre has moved on from hotbardriven games.  Initially it was just kick bash and taunt  that was all the tech could handle pretty much back in .  The  hotbar mashfest is the same game just with more buttons.  Even that model is now  years old.

MOBAs are not defined by a particular combat system.In relation to laning its about strategic control.  You are trying to get gold from killing the AI minions that walk across the map similiar to a tower defense game.  Your opponent is trying to prevent this.  You are feinting strength attempting to trade shots and using pressure from the rest of your team to force your opponent to not be able to get gold and XP.

4567365,0,t1_ct0tijp,Actually making AI capable of challenging a player isnt especially hard. You can make it operate under a set of simple rules that can be applied anywhere and create significantly more interesting and dynamic gameplay.Lets take an orc archer for example. If you make him aware of LOS of player health and armor bars and of his own health and armor bar you can cause him to prioritize targets that are armorless and thus have their health exposed. You can have him try to disengage and take cover breaking LOS when his own armor is destroyed. Suddenly you have an orc archer who well will tear players to tiny bits if they dont react well. Losing your armor means youre gonna start taking nasty hits from this guy as he singles you out so you have to duck in cover or play dodgeball with arrows... Which may be hard when you are fighting his more melee inclined allies.So you have your ranged player target him. Soon as you start dealing significant damage he ducks in cover and regenerates. Well balls. Now hes going to be a pain to get rid of too. You could coordinate your ranged DPS to take him down before he gets in cover but that takes their attention off the melee where they might be needed. You could send a guy over to take him down which is a good reason to have a guy who built for mobility instead of just raw DPS now isnt it? Especially if say these orc archers had a preference for high places to do their idling. You can just sprinkle these kinds of behaviors in. Maybe ALL enemies like to target health instead of armor. It just so happens that the archer is more often in a position to do so.Maybe ALL enemies like to break LOS when their armor is down and being shot at by ranged it just so happens that the archer is usually in a position to do so. Is it scripted? I mean in a sense. But AI is always going to be scripted. The difference is in how dynamic simple and adaptable that script is.You could make a fairly vicious pack hunter by giving it the behavior of liking to be around a few of its own kind liking to be X distance to its prey and Y distance from its allies prioritizing distance to prey and liking to attack things that have their back turned backing off from things that face them. Maybe they prioritize people with small or ranged weapons over guys with big huge axes. Maybe they like to try to get between vulnerable people and their allies and attack them which would force them to kite away from their allies. Maybe they prefer to target things that are alone. BAM. Nasty.Oh just stay clumped together? Congratulations youre using tactics. How about we give them a feint attack they do on people who are facing them with the occasional real one thrown in. Now back these guys with an orc archer. Youre now getting arrows rained on your head targeting your most vulnerable people while surrounded by wolves. An uncoordinated attempt to move will SURELY get one of you separated especially if say... The wolves have a snareslowknockdown they can use on one of you as you start running?And everything I described is eminently possible. The most complicated part would probably be getting the orc to recognize when hes breaking LOS in a dynamic world where the devs cant just set up cover markers and call it a day without bogging down the whole system in computations... Which happens to come back to the pathfinding issues the devs are supposedly hard at work on solving.Everything else is simple comparing of positions and numbers something any programmer could do on his lunch break. Toss in a few mathematical equations to help determine things like who is weakest in the group... Bam. You have yourselves some dangerous monsters.And see the beauty is in the simplicity. By mixing different sets of creatures with different skillsets they can take enemies that may can be defeated by a simple tactic by themselves but become infinitely more complicated in mixed groups.This way you create tactical situations rather than just wait for tank to pull grind them down with AoE and make sure you dodge this skill and dont spread the debuff! that you know because youve done this encounter a bajillion times before?

Also they are working the details out on combat which doesnt bother me. ya  classes. some may be break downs of old classes..that doesnt bother me that much since we will be able to change classes. I would say it doesnt overload a class but slims it down to being more specific to play style or tactic ...so ya in some situations  one set up may be better then another.

5114000,0,t3_3ky7lh,Intelligent behaviour  A living world that can survive and change the world without players so you feel as though you can actually change the direction of already persisting events.  Wars should occur with or without the presence of players.  Land should be conquered with or without the presence of players.  Towns should be built with or without the presence of players.Intelligent combat  When fighting an NPC Id like to feel like my skills as a combatant are being tested.  Sure dumb slow brutish NPCs wont pose as great a challenge.  If the NPCs swing and miss they should react to missing by saying something.  If they hit you they should also react to this.  It should feel like Im dueling a player of various mastery levels of their class.  Reaction timesskill shotspositioning etc.Formations in Combat   Tall shields?   of you?  Why not join them together and make a shield wall?  If NPC armies actually did this to advance towards a ranged focused opponent that would be a fantastic tactic employed on the battlefield.  Imbue them with magic to deflect spells as well?  A spell providing that benefit for a short period?A great combat system  Landmark combat having ONLY TWO abilities per weapon makes it VERY difficult for me to determine if EQN combat is going to be any better.  As it is now its too plain and repetitive.  More abilities are needed and when using a ranged weapon there should be the option to hold on to your shot and release when you want rather than just autofiring with that horrid lagging feeling before each shot goes off.  If you move and fire accuracy should be something that alters your hit box.Variable combat  Static combat is not something that any of us want.  Doing the same move over and over is just dull and boring.  There should be a reason to move around and change it up.Distinct Item appearance  I really liked how they mentioned you can visually see the supposed statistics on an item.  I hope they dont just mean the item glows red for lifesteal and green for dots...  Im pretty sure the way the bladehiltgripgemsrunes look and how many of something will contribute to differing stats of an item.Decent crafting system  Not a fan of Landmarks crafting system.  Its purely a grind fest and not interactive which isnt reflective of reality.  It should NOT take  ingots to make a weapon.   maybe  NOT !  This is copying WOW which should be avoided at all costs.  How you get the  or  ingots should be what we look at.Realistic Material deposits  Tell tale signs a material may be present.  In Landmark we currently see huge deposits of a material in one location.  It would be nice to actually see gold VEINS mixed in with various materials as they are in reality.  Is it possible to have more than  material per voxel?  As you mine away you receive both Gold  the other materials.  Our current Veins of materials just make a snake shape tunnel through the surrounding material.  It would look SOOOO much prettier as well if the walls of a cave sparkled with gold veinsspecks rather than seeing one HUGE glob of gold in one spot.Realistic carrying space  LESS materials should be required to make items but certain materials should be very difficult to accumulate in great quantities.  If you are conducting a mining operation you really should need a wagon or  to carry everything.  Ties in with Realistic Material Deposits.Vendor item cost balance  The cost of buying a weapon from an arms vendor should not be more easily accomplished than the time crafters spend harvesting materials and raising their crafting skill.  Completely devalues the time spent looking for materials which depending on the material should be more scarce than they presently are.,EQNext,cv2fffa,2,t5_2saln

5195435,0,t1_cvc1tio,Lots of things they can do to keep fans coming back but will come down to what demographics they go after. WoW still provides pretty challenging content all the way to faceroll to victory thanks to the difficulty settings and what not. My hope is that the Tiers sort of act like that but less gamey. Where you dont select EasyHardOMG! mode but the world and challenges are naturally separated and allow for players to decides how much of a challenge they want.My ideal would be something like Tier  Giant requires  Tier  characters but is still a okay challenge for a Tier  player. So that there is incentive to progress but then return. With somehow rewarding the Tier  in a manner that matches that of what a group of others earned but not just g for  player or g split  ways for a group. Some how have items and achievements tied into it all.So many possibilities they could go with thanks to an overall pretty open concept just depends on how crazy the devs want to get.,EQNext,cvc8skq,1,t5_2saln

As far as maturity I assure you there is a mature crowd. Far more then the WoW one ever was. I played WoW a lot and it was nothing to run into drama central. This community really didnt have issues till it came to Reddit where anyone and there uncle is now in here spouting off. Ya many have opinions and that is fine.

5242408,0,t1_cvhjwl2,Battlefield  didnt have total destruction capabilities like what Next is proposing. Usually only things that were concrete or smaller were capable of being destroyed. Basically it falls into some things are destructible line of games. That doesnt take away its tactical use though. It is just more limited then what it sounds like in the above description.As for friendly fire it could easily kill  allies and  enemy in the wrong situation. Very possible to face lots of trolls.At SOE  technical panel they did show off some of the VoxelFarm technology that shows when a block of land voxels was separated so nothing was supporting it it would then fall. The way this was done is that the voxel would be turned into a prop for a short time to allow it to fall and use physics. They plan to get this into EQNLandmark but it could take some time to get it to work properly. Their whole destructible props plays heavily with this.They also talked though they arent at that stage yet about a structure based on physics no longer allowing it to be supported and thus falls. This is much more difficult to accomplish then many thing. Most games use scripts for things like this like the Battlefield games. EQNLandmark would be more realtime.,EQNext,cvhwef9,1,t5_2saln

The same course SOE set them on....So in this scenario they are one in the same stated by their Senior Producer himself.Now if that is the same what else remains the same?Im definitely upset with their lack of transparency and information regarding progress and workings of the game even after they changed their name to DBG.... But transparency was a promise made by SOE though they have thrown the word around since the transfer...

6026800,0,t1_cy9dsm1,Um not its not what horizontal progression is at all. LOL. Just a clear example of forward progression disguised in a levelless game environment. That tricks so many people I cant really blame you for that.Dont believe me? What if... in a totally gearless game after the first dungeon you level up and gain HPMP and Damage allowing you to damage the second levels monsters. After defeating the second level you ding another level then gain a skill called bomb. Using the skill you learned at level  you can access level  by using bomb. ect. That isnt lateral progression bro. Thats forward progression. Just because there are no levels doesnt mean every progression is lateral lmao.Horizontal progression means that at level cap you can just muck around and not worry about grinding anything you dont want to grind because nothing is supposed to matter. Basically spam events for appearance gear.Even though GW has gear checks in a small part of the game its still lateral progression because nothing you can get in FOTM is unique to the game. The only thing that increases with FOTM ad gearchecks are the drop chancerates on the FOTM items with exception of the tonic can be had elsewhere in the game.The zones in Landmark are clearly separated by tiers. The problem with this though in Next how are they going to make the T zones worthwhile to T players? Because in every game that has gone basically levelless old content hasnt become more exciting when its below level. WoWGWSWTOR are basically levelless games now because even though they have levels actual player level isnt important. Even so they have to FORCE people to go back and play out of level content.So all the talk about a levelless game sounds so exciting. Im telling you its already out there all around you and its not any more exciting than a game with levels. In fact id be willing to bet a game is more exciting with forward progression with a hard level grind because then below level content is played for pure enjoyment and not forcefully downscaled.EQs mentor system was the best.
