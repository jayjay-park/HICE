2492195,0,t1_cmjhbtj,I find it better to not say where Im from to avoid any identification because almost all the kendo community here in my country is quite aware of the policy of my dojo.And you are right this competitive aspect seems rather contrary to the koukenchiai philosophy.,kendo,cmjv8yt,1,t5_2qo63
2495928,0,t3_2o3ksj,Ditto everything uBocote said Kendo people are probably not your target customers if durability and leaner blade profile are your main selling points. Durability isnt a big issue with red and white oak the way we use them in kendo. Having one person using a bokken made of harder material that could potentially put deeper dents on his partners softer wood bokken is a con rather than a pro.Thinner profile again is more of a con than a pro in kendo since the bokken profile is very standardized in Kendo.At  or more I imagine very few kendoka would be interested when they can get wooden ones for  or less. Personally I think its a cool product you have here. If you are looking for ideas or is trying to branch out to new markets have you considered making western weapons and reaching out to the HEMA community at rwma or other types of nonJapanese martial arts? Still at  or more you are approaching the price range of steel simulators which is infinitely more preferable to any other types of material because why approximate when you can just use the real thing.,kendo,cmkctfw,3,t5_2qo63

3192133,0,t3_2wp4k7,From my very limited experience I never really went into kendo because I thought it would be fun in a sense I did think it was going to be a fun thing to do but when I started it I had the full intention of following the precepts laid out by the AJKF all japan kendo federation which is at the most basic level using the katana to cultivate the mind and the body. You say that you dont really believe in the whole way of the sword idea but that is simply what kendo means it is the way of the sword theres no escaping the fundamental concept of what kendo is. And I show my friends shiais and all of that to give them a taste of kendo but I always make sure to tell them that its never about winning a competition competitions are fun and great ways to test your own skill and to see other peoples kendo but being a master competitor has never been the singular purpose of kendo. Theres a documentary about achieving the th dan rank and a Japanese man that tried multiple times to achieve that rank always seemed to fail. He was a top competitor for Japan and theres no doubt that he was skilled in his kendo but he said himself that his spirit of competitiveness was the thing that restricted him from achieving his goal and I think thats just something that everyone has to face eventually that kendo is a continually humbling experience and its more than just a hobby its a lifelong journey of honest selfimprovement and deep insight into oneself.Personally Im not a super competitive person but I did want to do something that was way out of my comfort zone all the yelling the spirit the kiai I was never the type of person to do those kinds of things I wanted to compete with myself I wanted to grow as an individual not by beating someone else but by beating myself. The only true contest in kendo is between yourself of today and yourself of tomorrow I go into every session and spend every mokuso telling myself At the end of this session if I had to face myself would I be a better kendoka now than I was before and I think that if you ever get back into kendo fullon which I strongly urge you to do then it needs to stop being about beating somebody and start being about being a better kendoka once you focus on that then the ippons will come you can definitely have shiais as a short term goal to aim towards but overall the goal is to simply become a better kendokaTheres a reason we dont practice kenjutsu but we practice specifically kendo we arent learning to strike an opponent down we are learning how to develop ourselves through the way of the sword.Just my two cents,kendo,cosv4qd,10,t5_2qo63
3415800,0,t3_2zam3c,As mentioned kenshi.net has plenty of articles. One you probably will be interested in would be on shinai kyogi The book This is Kendo contains a lot of history One individual you may be interested in is Yukio Mishima. He was a Japanese writerauthor who was an extremist and really fought to bring back the old Japanese ways. Mishima who did kendo and iaido though apparently wasnt very good eventually attempted a coup and then committed seppuku.As an example he wrote a short story about Kendo titled Ken which was made into a movie by the same name. The movie concluded with the main character committing suicide out of shame for his fellow club members. One particular quote uttered by the main character near the beginning of the movie upon learning that one of their classmates committed suicide was only a coward or a very brave man is able to kill himself.   While its not exactly on topic you might want to angle this story as exactly the kind of thing that the Americans wanted to prevent when they banned many militaristic martial arts thus the conversion of bujutsu into budo. Maybe link that with atrocious war crimes Japan committed in the past e.g. Nanking.Whats keisahitzone?,kendo,cphmj4y,2,t5_2qo63
3715279,0,t1_cqfq7ru,To hit going back there are two ways with and without fumikomi stomping.  Your sensei probably wants you to use fumikomi.  When you come into the opponent use your taiatari body crash to create distance between you and the opponent and time the strike with your fumikomi.  Use the fumikomi to launch yourself backwards.  If you are hitting men raise up into jodan as you go back and hold jodan until you are safely clear then return to chudan.  If you are hitting kote or doh keep chudan going back.  Really your sensei should be instructing you on this my words probably wont be enough.As far as when to attack that is the reason for the practice to discover when to attack and various other things.  You are making the standard beginners mistake of thinking that all these problems can be overcome if only you had the explanation of just how to do it.  Really what you need is more practice and lots of it and eventually it will come around.,kendo,cqfrnn3,1,t5_2qo63
3716523,0,t1_cqf98f1,Looking down is not really a problem when receiving men its done to present a good target. Obviously its not a smart idea for a short person to bow their head against a hugetall opponent but for shorter opponents specifically its better for their kihon until they can get used to striking men. Getting hit on the back of the head is NOT the fault of the motodachi unless they over exaggerate this. If the shinai is able to wrap around the top part of the head and hit the back what does that tell you about the distance and the part of the shinai thats hitting?As for the kamae thing I fear you misunderstood his question it seems more like hes asking when performing Zanshin when is it good to go back into Chudan which is when you have finished your cut followed through FAR ENOUGH so that your opponent cannot cut you turned around if necessary and as you turn be in chudan.,kendo,cqfwrv9,1,t5_2qo63
4108331,0,t1_crnsk4o,I think I know what you are talking about. Just today a sensei told me squeeze my hands inwards when my shinai comes into contact as it would generate more power.And thank you your replies were indeed helpful. I actually tried to keep center during aimen and I believe it helped. Although I didnt land my hit the sensei didnt hit his either. And as you stated attacking often also seemed to help. I usually dont know when to attack as I cant really tell whether there is an opening or not unless the sensei makes it obvious. So I decided to just attack whenever I felt like it was time to attempt an attack and the sensei did not seem to disapprove.,kendo,crokpzc,1,t5_2qo63

4424332,0,t1_csny361,Yeah I understand the win at all cost stance the Japanese team took. Would be too embarrassing to lose as the host country.You are right though that the internet did overblow everything. Lots of criticism about etiquette and fairness etc particularly at the th WKC in Italy. Unfortunately thats just what happens when you open the audience to such a scale  I remember watching the online streams and seeing all the racist comments in the chat section. Its just too easy to yell around when you can remain anonymous with no repercussion.I have Korean friendsfellow players so I know a little bit about their side as well. Its unfortunate that theres a lot of politics throughout the many kendo associations in Korea because I think that resulted in alienating some of their best players.On the other hand I also sympathise with the Korean team who have always been seen as the underdogs under the shadow of the Japanese team. I think all that attention and expectation pushes them to both politically and psychologically perform as they did in the WKCs. Unfortunately being in the spotlight also makes it easier for people to criticise.However I think the Korean teams attitude has improved significantly. Whilst they are at times still look desperate at least they seem to be a lot less showy at accepting their losses. Their kantoku was sitting in front of me during the team finals and when the taisho match ended he just nodded in silence.Next WKC in Korea will be very interesting though. Looking forward to it.,kendo,csodp5y,1,t5_2qo63

Turn off the phone and put it away. Sit up and keep talking to a minimum. If you have questions wait until after practice. If you cant stay for the full practice I would make a point of waiting until a break and thanking them for allowing you to watch instead of just disappearing like you maybe got bored.

Most casual health blog type articles recommending it all gloss over the HIGH INTENSITY part. From what I have read to achieve the result advertised in the original research you need to go all out to the point of feeling like passing out. Its an extremely difficult and taxing training regimen devised to get that extra bit out of elite level athletes. Jumping rope rowing and swimming would be my recommendation.
