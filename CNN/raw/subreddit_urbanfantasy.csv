4463686,0,t3_3c8den,Not precisely sure how to say this but k crowdfunding campaigns for books really arent that successful. thanks copy  how much are you planning on charging for the retail version of the ebook? .? .? Why would I pay  time the retail cost just for maybe getting it a couple of days earlier than available on Amazon et al? is a rather specific marketing budget  what do you plan on using this for? Kirkus review? Netgalley? Man standing on a street corner screaming about it for a weekend? for cover art? Do you have an artist in mind? Have you looked into cheaper options  even custom photomanip covers can be procured for about . Or you can buy premades from about .New computer  as a potential backer and not an existing fan I dont really care that your computer is broken and if you just need it for writing Id suggest buying a HP StreamChromebook. Besides I could build a kickass gaming computer for k so this feels slightly like overkill.Personal expenses  again youre just some random on the internet  what are you going to do once this money runs out you pitch it as three weeks to get your book ready do you expect to be making a living off it as soon as it hits stores?Additional query  do your conversioninterior design include the fees for the paperback versions? Does your cover price include both ebook and paperback versions?.Are you a member of places like Kboards?,urbanfantasy,cstbqqx,14,t5_2tmdu
4648637,0,t3_3dvcci,Daniel Faust series by Craig Schaefer  Much darker tone than Dresden with a protagonist who is more antivillain than antihero but the author also avoids much of the insanely creepy male gaze that pervades Jim Butchers work.

Meet Fortitude Scott a milennial reluctant vampire who works minimum wage jobs and lives paycheck to paycheck because screw you vampire mom!  Naturally that cant hold forever.

4671033,0,t1_ctj2dms,Alpha and Omega is Patrica Briggs other current series. Its set in the same world as Mercy and there is some character overlap. I would say its heavier on the romance element than Mercy books. Its centered around Brans son Charles and Anna who is an Omega wolf.  Im not sure how much to spoil here.

5622592,0,t1_cwbt1qu,I tell you why I dont use that term anymore It is mostly used to criticize badly constructed female characters. Male characters are under much less scrutiny. What a shocker.  Id like for people to just say Look this character makes stupid decisions treats people poorly and yet for some mystical reason Book wants me to believe everybody loves her. I dont buy it. Authorial fail I say. And refrain from calling her a Mary Sue. Everyone is so so quick to point and yell Mary Sue! at the slightest provocation. They also use it with provocation. I get it. Nobody calls Tony Stark a Mary Sue but they will call any female multiple male admirers one. Why? I dont buy any character that instantly attracts the opposite sex all of it all the time. But really think about how many times a female character is accusedcorrectly or incorrectlyof being a Mary Sue while their male counterparts are somehow not Mary Sues.  ,urbanfantasy,cwu1b49,1,t5_2tmdu

9947847,0,t3_5hyixq,I personally really enjoy the Anita Blake books by Laurell K Hamilton.  I know many dislike the romantic elements added in later books but personally they never bothered me.  Mileage may vary there but Im a huge fan of both those and the Hollows if that helps.   Dresden Files by Jim Butcher also solid stuff.,urbanfantasy,db48a97,1,t5_2tmdu

10534001,0,t3_5qtwij,I have read more urban fantasy than I probably have read any other genre. I just do not read standalones pretty much ever.I would always recommend reading the first book in a series though! it would be The Others by Anne Bishop. It has a very very strong start to the series. Each book is strong in their own right. Also it will only have  books total though I read on the authors Facebook page something about a spinoff? Not certain about that yet. Five books is not a very long series and there are quite a few urban fantasy series that are longer.It is also the least offensive to a random person than some of the rest of the starter urban fantasy series. A lot of starter series start off badly. Or they start off okay get better and then decline in quality. Also there are a ton of series out there that have sex in them which make people angry.The Others also has a lot of elements from other genres to start someone out with. Anne Bishop was originally a fantasy writer and it shows throughout the series. She is clearly able to put together an amazing world even if it is just our slightly different own. There are horror elements weaved throughout too mostly with the Sanguinati. There is less romance but you can see the buds of it which is just plain cute. It even sometimes feels like a young adult novel because of Megs childlike qualities. I could also argue that it feels sort of like a postapocalyptic series because of the lack of full technology the fact they have to live off the earth crops are a real concern the government is not exactly all together etc.Of course if I know what exactly they want I could recommend one of probably two dozen series. Just as a general recommendation Hey I want to try Urban Fantasy what would you say I should try it will definitely be the Others.,urbanfantasy,dd258rb,3,t5_2tmdu
