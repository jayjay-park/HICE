Network security engineers typically have little experience or interest in SCADA while SCADA engineers usually see security as an annoying distraction. My personal view is that IoT and SCADA technologies are going to merge and maybe antiquated SCADA protocols will fall by the wayside MODBUS DNP etc. SCADA devices will have to adopt IPv do PLCs support this? Not sure. I know Motorola and probably others have adopted systemwide encryption. Still I think many SCADA systems are only as strong as the cheap padlock in the field protecting their PLC or cable guard protecting their RS link.Good viewing is the defcon talks on youtube. ISO ISA if you can get a hold of them.Best practices are wholistic organisationwide procedures that protect against social engineering physical access and of course remote access.It would be interesting for you to approach organisations and ask to conduct a security audit. See how easy you can gain access to their factory floor to their wifi ask the receptionist for the password all that social eng stuff theres a heap of stuff you could try to get material for your doc. good luck.,SCADA,cysu2d4,2,t5_2s55s

It all depends on where you are in your life regarding family wife kids hobbies etc.  When you want to not be on the road anymore you will probably have to take a pay cut and go work at one of the plants you currently support.   Or you could get as much training and experience as possible and start your own support company and travel much less and have more time off.  What company are you with now if you dont mind my asking?,SCADA,d887sa0,1,t5_2s55s
