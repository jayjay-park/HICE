1156099,0,t3_27be0q,Maybe it isnt a popular opinion but Im not really happy about this. I drive through that intersection on my way to and home from work and I just dont think that the traffic is bad enough to warrant a large construction project. I get that this new design will go a long way to alleviating the existing traffic but I personally saw it as a nonissue. I read the report and the ADT didnt specify if the numbers presented all used that intersection just that there are that amount of drivers on those two roads. Memorial and Broad are long and busy streets and a lot of people can travel on those roads without ever using that intersection. I feel like the numbers were padded in a way that makes people feel better about having major construction ACTUALLY cause a significant backup of traffic. If they are doing it with the focus on future traffic I can grasp that a little better but I still feel about the same.Will it be nice? Yes of course it will it should turn out to be a nice bridge. I just feel that it isnt as big an issue as it was made out to be and the money could have been spent in different areas and would be more beneficial to the town as a whole.,murfreesboro,chzoebz,2,t5_2s6s9

5220937,0,t1_cvew0z0,Good for you moving on and you completely missed where I mentioned I dont value financial security or career decisions as something I see in making a person successful. I find those that have self reliance and perseverance more admirable. I dont have empathy for people like OP or you who wish to perpetuate the ideas related to the topic posted as it comes across as desperate by their own choice to be that way.,murfreesboro,cvfbc6o,1,t5_2s6s9

Its close to the interstate near the hospital via back roads  and not taking memorial or old fort. Plus side. Its not near the college. So fewer worries there.,murfreesboro,dcp4r8t,2,t5_2s6s9
