6182976,0,t3_4099l1,Seems decent but Id maybe look for something that supports x if you want to game on it. px wide is a bit too narrow for most modern titles Ive found.As for the adapter just get one of those pinchanging adapters to connect the monitors VGA to the DVI port on your card. No real conversion required.,GloriousCRTMasterRace,cysfuxu,5,t5_35xcc

10408474,0,t1_dck55pc,Out of circuit a MOSFET should read as a diode across the source and drain.   The gate should read open circuit to both legs.  If you have a short across any pair of legs its toast. ,GloriousCRTMasterRace,dcnv9qi,1,t5_35xcc
10640272,0,t1_ddc0bbc,It looks like both of those do indeed output analog. Is there any particular reason you do not wish to buy used?That  is a beast of a monitor.
