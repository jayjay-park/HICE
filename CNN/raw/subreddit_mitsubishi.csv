If buying an additional set of rims would not be feasible because of cost really mounting a set of winter tires will still be ok.

8044671,0,t1_d4hm6ll,Did some more digging some third party usb cables will cause audio systems to not register apple products right. Only in a few cases this was the fix. Other people mentioned something about a firmware update on the car audio system. Problems like this range on all different vehicles though. Mine is a  lancer with a factory Rockford system in it and I still have problems with it. So I really dont know. Maybe its an apple thing. ,mitsubishi,d4kapmr,1,t5_2sla7

10170226,0,t3_5lcph5,Can confirm this is totally normal for these cars. I have an evo x and was a little worried at first especially when engine is cold and weather is cold but after some research thats just how they are. As you put more miles on the car the shifting will get smoother. Just let the car warm up and like others mentioned make sure to change oils at recommended intervals! ,mitsubishi,dbwunbc,1,t5_2sla7

10982264,0,t1_decb9vq,Im an old evo  owner and I daily it well been off road for some time with fixing stuff but the back jarring lack of comfort is definitely one of things Ive come see is probably evos biggest let down as daily vehicle. Ive added Bilstein HD Bs from evo  which is almost worlds different to standard suspension to help it. Another reason I suggest evo  as with what SirDigbyChknCaesar said if performance is key G from these earlier evos with breathing and fueling like exhaust intake piping blow off valve and fuel pump even though they make less out of the box on for few hundred quid you can make more power than evo x with said mods and a tune on good fuel to exploit them and is also a lot easier to work on generally if wish to toy with it more in future. ,mitsubishi,decszpe,1,t5_2sla7
10994301,0,t3_5wffad,Mitsubishi still has a k public incentive on the Evo. Was hoping they would up it given price and age of the remaining stock. My only local dealer is tiny but has one in white.  Lancers are  off have been for months for comparison.,mitsubishi,dee6449,1,t5_2sla7
