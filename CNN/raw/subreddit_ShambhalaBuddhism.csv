5192437,0,t3_386k5j,Your dilemma is an interesting one. I dont have any answers. Ive been running into this funny contradiction latelyHow does the bodhisattva reconcile utilizing the skill of setting boundaries as compassionate act and the suffering it may inevitably cause at first from which there are karmic consequences that could lead to further suffering?If boddhichita is the supreme thought and the path tends to lead toward it how do we set compassionate boundaries on the path while continually opening up knowing we might be unknowingly wrecking a few things along the way?Perhaps it doesnt matter. ,ShambhalaBuddhism,cvbvr7h,1,t5_30ui4
