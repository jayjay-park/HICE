Lejeune was so offended that she not only walked out before the end but permanently resigned her post as film critic for The Observer. Other negative reviews stated a blot on an honorable career plainly a gimmick movie and merely one of those television shows padded out to two hours. Positive reviews stated Anthony Perkins performance is the best of his career ... Janet Leigh has never been better played out beautifully and first American movie since Touch of Evil to stand in the same creative rank as the great European films.

On his TV show with Gene Siskel Ebert said that the film is basically a good idea for a film that never gets off the ground. Siskel added I dont know what the film is about. Its so totally confused and taking things from different parts. On one hand if it wants to say something about a childseye view of war you got a movie made by John Boorman called Hope and Glory that was just released that is much better and much more daring in showing the whimsy that childrens view of war is. On the other hand this film wants to hedge its bet and make it like an adventure film so youve got like Indiana Jones with the John Malkovich character helping the little kid through all the fun of war.

Bosley Crowther of The New York Times wrote There is not an abundance of subtlety or the lately familiar Hitchcock bent toward significant and colorful scenery in this obviously lowbudget job. Crowther called the slow buildups to sudden shocks reliably melodramatic but contested Hitchcocks psychological points reminiscent of KrafftEbings studies as less effective. While the film did not conclude satisfactorily for the critic he commended the casts performances as fair. British critic C. A. Lejeune was so offended that she not only walked out before the end but permanently resigned her post as film critic for The Observer. Other negative reviews stated a blot on an honorable career plainly a gimmick movie and merely one of those television shows padded out to two hours. Positive reviews stated Anthony Perkins performance is the best of his career ... Janet Leigh has never been better played out beautifully and first American movie since Touch of Evil to stand in the same creative rank as the great European films.

David Rooney in his review for The Hollywood Reporter said that Celebrity in the age of the viral sensation gets broad treatment in this modest effort unlikely to reflect its title while Katherine Kilkenny of Indiewire opined that the films holierthanthou approach produces laughs in the initial scenes but edges closer to bland misanthropy once Libertys developed characters get their unjust deserts.WikipediaMore info at IMDb Wikipedia Rotten Tomatoes Freebase  I am a bot.
