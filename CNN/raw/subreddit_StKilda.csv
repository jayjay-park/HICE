916391,0,t1_ch8g5x2,Geez thats all we fucking need.  Gears was our hardest worker in the first quarter and hes become a key backman over the last couple of years.,StKilda,ch8g78i,2,t5_2xeh1
5176454,0,t3_3lwl8u,I wouldve given Markworth and Siposs one more year they have been unlucky with injuries which havent really been related. Maybe theyll put them on the rookie list.,StKilda,cv9yb9y,1,t5_2xeh1

7761465,0,t1_d3o3e5b,Terrible metaphor.Im really not sure the forward line is working. No one really seems to lead hard for the ball and they just seem to be in each others way  of the time. Bruces problem is that he likes to lead sideways through the zone whereas if you watch tall forward lines like Adelaide or North its important for key forwards to lead at the ball to move the zone and create space for teammates. Wouldnt mind seeing Bruce rested soon.,StKilda,d3of2ft,2,t5_2xeh1
10731592,0,t1_ddmuxbo,Yeah certainly tough to leave him out. My reasoning is that Geary is captain and is our only shut down small defender. Roberton is in the leadership group so probably gets a game before Savage. And Gilbert because he can play all over the ground and the club likes having him in the team. ,StKilda,ddmvte0,1,t5_2xeh1
11329139,0,t3_61en2t,Ugh I went to the game and was still am pretty disappointed. The switch off after the st Qtr was terrible to watch. Poor ball use and decisions Hicky was equal to or better than Gawn in the matches last year And he got towled up. The back line was a mess  we all know that if you watched.There was a moment in the nd quarter i think when it was centred to Wright who did Sweet FA fumbled and that resulted in a turn over and goal at the other end which started off the beginning a multitude of skill errors.    Positives  Gresh Roo amp Steele  Negatives  many. Roo was the danger man when it should have been Bruce amp Membrey Weller Jacky...,StKilda,dfg50ls,1,t5_2xeh1
