2934470,0,t3_2tmi39,The further devastation of the Greece economy was well known to the international creditors when they were adopting the terms of their bailoutsgtLeaked Memo Blows The Lid Off Of The Entire Greek Bailout At least Europe is no longer in denial about the effects of austerity in Greece and the ability for the country to improve its economic situation via drastic cuts.Peter Spiegel at FT has obtained a confidential page memo distributed to senior officials in Europe over the last week which lays out the truthIt warned that two of the new bailouts main principles might be selfdefeating. Forcing austerity on Greece could cause debt levels to rise by severely weakening the economy while its bn debt restructuring could prevent Greece from ever returning to the financial markets by scaring off future private investors.Prolonged financial support on appropriate terms by the official sector may be necessary the report said.Whats more  and this Spiegel puts in a followup blog post  all the economic assumptions being used are too rosy further rendering prospects of a successful bailout unlikely.He also has some excerpts from the note including reasonable downside expectations if things dont go swimminglyUnder the tailored scenario described above the debt ratio would peak at  percent of GDP in . Once growth did recover fiscal policy achieved its target and privatization picked up the debt would begin to slowly decline. Debt to GDP would fall to around  percent of GDP by  well above the target of about  percent of GDP set by European leaders. Financing needs through  would amount to perhaps  billion. Under the assumption that stronger growth could follow on the eventual elimination of the competitiveness gap the debt ratio would slowly converge to that in the baseline but likely only in the late s. With debt ratios so high in the next decade smaller shocks would produce unsustainable dynamics leaving the program highly accidentprone.Again basically what it shows is that European leaders cant deny what everyone sees as obvious That everything undertaken so far is destroying the Greek economy and that further reforms will only make it worse.Read more ,betternews,co1ntlv,1,t5_30lae
