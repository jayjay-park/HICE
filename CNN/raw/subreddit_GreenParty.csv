We have a mechanism in place big money controls our political process mainstream Ds and Rs are rampant sellouts the slick packaging has come to equate quality third parties look like a ghetto by comparison success begets success creating support disparity less support means lessarticulated campaigns less articulated campaigns seem less supportable by now you can see a vortex of suck has formedTo reject big money in politics we need to reject the notion that a candidate deserves a lesser job just because shes struggling for America rather than coasting for Wall Street. Ralph Nader is a very tired man. He can have a cabinet position.

6860879,0,t1_d0snp98,I think voting for Bernie is respectable when we look at the likelihood of Jill taking the Presidency and the other people that could end up winning and how horrible of a state the country is already in.However I think theres something to be said for exiting the  party system and if a third party is what people want to see they ought to be getting with the GP no questions about it. This is ultimately what brought me from BerniegtJill. Ive read about the way hes treating more progressive nonDemocrat candidates in his home state and I find it a bit unsettling as a person who wants to see an end to the corporatesponsored party loyalty. Bernie himself says that he wants a revolution. I dont take the word too lightly and I think Jill is aware of the direction our country must go if were in any way serious about it.  I am voting for Jill because I think you gotta pull the plug on both parties at some point if were actually serious about revolution. The old those ideas would never work adage is no longer becoming a valid counterpoint against the Greens since they are just a noninterventionist propeace version of Bernie. I see it as a winwin and it actually is the direction I believe our country must go if were going to see an end to the middle east wars and the aggression with the other modern countries like China and Russia. I think its our vaguely justified military budget that will be our demise contrary to what all the Republicans are saying about entitlements and other such things. The Greens have a vehicle that is prime for building greater consciousness among working class folks. They are the actual BASE of the party where in the Democrats these people are a mere progressive wing that are paid lip service to. It is frustrating when we look at how this wing is treated by the more conservative Democrats. There is certain positions it seems you are simply not allowed to take if youre a Democrat or a Republican nowadays. I think one of those positions is being even vaguely critical of Israel. Perhaps theres others but the idea that they have positions where they just wont go even though it may be the right thing to do for creating a more peaceful world are frightening. Bernie won my state in a landslide as it is and I did caucus for him.  Thus my GE vote goes to Jill. ,GreenParty,d0tzne4,3,t5_2rgbf

8552138,0,t1_d6akgun,Do I need to explain to you the difference between Marxist Communism and Leninist Communism? Marxist Communism is worker ownership of the means of production without state control. The dictatorship of the proletariat which is just a fancy way of saying direct democracy eventually dissolves and creates what you call Libertarian Socialism. Libertarian Socialism as you seem to define it  is a way of describing the end stage of Socialism independent of the preceding steps. I read the Wikipedia article and press release you linked me and I fail to see the difference. The two are synonyms and yes I have read Marx. Libertarian Socialism is not a single coherent philosophy but a catchall term used to describe political belief systems that are similar to Marxist Socialism but not identical enough to be called that. Some forms of Libertarian Socialism believe that Communism can be achieved without a revolution others do not some support greater or lesser amounts of workerowned capitalism. You may fall on the Libertarian Socialist spectrum but that doesnt necessarily make you a Socialist in the single word sense.Leninist Communism is what people think of when they think of the red scare. Its the belief that a group that wants to implement Socialism before conditions get bad enough to create a Communist revolution naturally can overthrow the government with or without the support of a majority of the proletariat and create a dictatorship that builds a Socialist system then dissolves itself. Worker ownership of companies and worker ownership of the means of production are two very different things. In the latter companies dont exist and people directly own resources. The Greens appear to support the former. EcoSocialism as they describe it is a democratized capitalism. Yes Im smug because Im right. Take a government class pick up a dictionary you seem to know what you believe but are unable to properly define it.There are many political philosophies along the Libertarian Socialist spectrum and while most have their own names some have not had names coined yet. What the Green party has created is new innovative and amazing a possible solution to the wall our current economic systems have hit. But I just really dont think EcoSocialism is a good name for it because they arent supporting pure Socialism. Democratic capitalism? Ecodemocracy? Environmental capitalist democracy? I dont know which exactly should be used although I think Democratic Capitalism is the nicest sounding potential name. But the current term theyre using just isnt adequate.,GreenParty,d6al9lv,1,t5_2rgbf
