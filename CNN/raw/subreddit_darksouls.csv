1343,0,t3_1u43ku,I just did my first ever invasion a few days ago because Im always terrified of going against actual humans in any game that starts off with bots. Ive been invaded before and won a couple of times but Ive never instigated it. My first invasion was in Darkroot Garden and it was evidently a fight club. They stopped what they were doing to come kick my ass in seconds. Since then Ive had something like  invasions on a minmaxed character I made and Im loving it.Although my favorite moment was invading in Blighttown. The host had a gold and white phantom guarding him and they were all doing flips and shit. I got backstabbed twice in a row before I two shot one of them with my claymore then dodged into a soul spear that wouldve killed me from the other phantom parried and riposted an attack I only guessed was coming then combusted him to death. The host just looked at me turned around and ran for the fog gate. I didnt think Id be able to catch up to him but as he was using the gate I managed to backstab him then hit him again for the kill. God damn I love being a Dickwraith.,darksouls,ceelaoz,1,t5_2sazo

Down in Ash Lake some of those other trees are not that far off Lordan is wide enough to fit at least several archtrees underneath it not just one.

61773,1,t1_celgbhs,Use a spear against any toptier player and youll get absolutely demolished I can promise you this. Spears are much of a utility weapon as they are an offensive powerchoice. The range may be long but the poisebreak attack rating AR and critical bonus are extremely low andor bad. There are only really three widely used spears Silver Knight Spear Moonlught Butterly Horn and the Demons Spear. If someone uses them on you just turtle or poise backstab them. Use a spear of your own or attempt to parry them if they attempt to spam. Not only do you have spears of your own to combat them you have shotels for extreme turtles dead angle WoGs for the faith users Pyro ti apply pressure poking weapons such as the Estoc Bestoc and the Rapier DWGR for easy rollbs punishes. and a variety of other counters. You also have a wide array of shields at your disposal such as paring the crest shield up if youre against a Moonlight Butterly Horn user.gtDo you honestly not understand why someone in a video game might choose to avoid the top tier characters or weapons because they find they make it a little too easy to win?Using a spear hardly makes the game too easy especially in PvP and beyond. I find that only English players will purposely gimp themselves in Dark Souls while you see toptier Japanese and some English players utilize what the game has given them. You will rarely see anyone use a spear as their main weapon theyre mostly used to chip someone out or to be used as a way of turtling in RTST mode but this has mostly been replaced by the Estoc in recent months. gthere are plenty of characters in various fighting games  like Justice in Guilty Gear  that are banned from tournament play.Im sorry I didnt realize that Dark Souls was an arcade fighting game. There doesnt need to be absolute balance but spears are certainly not unbalanced. The reason you might have watched someone sweet the floor in a fight club with a spear is because of their skill not necessarily because of their weapon choice. You can easily see someone come in and sweet with a midroll build or with fist weapons that doesnt make them OP. ,darksouls,celgo9d,2,t5_2sazo

What I meant is that you wont be able to pick up the spell scrolls and carvings that are physically located in the DLC since you cannot drop those items for other players.But since you have the souls in hand they should act the same way as if you had gotten them yourself.

100426,0,t3_1v8pjk,damn you must have some good weed. all kidding aside I felt the same way on my first visit to blighttown. I stumbled upon the bonfire by the great hollow signs. I had to either go all the way down or head back thru blighttown. I just went deeper I had to. I got to ash lake I looked up and I was in awe. Had I really been there I wouldve laid down on the sand looked up at the world above me and cried.I wouldve cried not just from the beauty but also because I was cursed and I knew I would have to go back up that tree and out of blighttown if I wanted to keep playing. and I did.

119579,0,t1_ces0s6y,Thanks for the thorough information! Guess ill go with the QualityPyro Build then. With that build i can use the Zweihander if necessary and am still very versatile for all kinds of weapons! And havin a range fireball spell aint that bad either.A few more questions though.. If i reach SL  for example will i still be able to co op with other players? Currently i can co op with others at the demon firesage or centipede demon bonfire for exmaple. But will that be still possible after reachin such a high SL? I heard there are level ranges regardin co op play. So if i want to co op at Anor Londo before OampS which Sl should i best have? . Are lightning or fire uprgades still viable for Quality Builds?I have a  Fireclaymore at my box. Should i upgrade it further or let it be? I Know that Quality Builds are using the scaling for max damage but i also want to have some weapons with elemental damage. Which way to go? Upgrade a weapon to  Fire or get some other weapons with elemental damage Like Ornstein Spear or Demon Spear?,darksouls,ces1q3u,1,t5_2sazo
120008,0,t1_ces2rev,Honestly the only reason youd need to optimize your build is if you plan on stopping at a specific level for either coop or PvP. If youre just planning on doing the PvE you can bring your stats up to whatever you want.I actually think all players SHOULD have a  build to experiment with weapons on. You can wield pretty much everything and do considerable damage so it makes for a great testing character.If you want to PvP with this character youre still not totally lost with a  build. In fact go  Vit End Str AND Dex. Youll still be in PvP range and youll be incredibly diverse. Since you threw all those extra points in Strength sorcery and miracles are out of the question but you should still have a few points for some attunement slots as a Pyro. Its not necessarily optimal but you get to enjoy the entire moveset of almost every weapon since you can wield them any way you want.,darksouls,ces3h9r,3,t5_2sazo

127828,0,t3_1vjwpb,At any point in time you can choose to backtrack and pick up anything you need to sway the fight in your favour. I recommend going to the painted world for loot if you havent already or going back to firelink and kill stray demon. You can get the key to the seal and open up opportunities for a  weapon or run down to the catacombs and kill pinwheel to obtain the rite of kindling. With easy access to humanity in the depths you can kindle bonfires to your hearts content. If you have the white soapstone you can often get yourself summoned for oamps which will give you a lot of souls and a humanity if you kill them. There are plenty of options to make this easier for yourself but it all depends on where you are willing to backtrack to. With the shortcut through sens fortress you can probably make it back to firelink in a few minutes. Good luck ,darksouls,ceszkrk,3,t5_2sazo

135045,0,t1_cetb04k,I began to write up nearly this exact same comment but then I saw yours so Ill just expand upon it.Dark Souls is a better game and is more polished but DeS is unparalleled in terms of atmosphere in a videogame.  DeS also has better game design in a few areas. Namely the ability to trade boss souls for spells weapon scaling being useful making str and dex more appealing and the nonexistence of pyromancies since fire spells were sorceries.  The netcode for DeS is server based rather than pp based making for a much more cohesive online experience.  The netcode was so reliable that  PvP tournaments were held and finding players was never frustrating.Also weapon movesets were more diverse in DeS.  The Meat Cleaver for instance starkly contrasts the Dragon Bone Smasher although they are both huge greatswords.,darksouls,cett7wt,2,t5_2sazo

You died multiple times but always learned as you went and sooner or later you figured out the bosses strategy and took him down easily. Each boss was becoming easier for you to study your deaths become less frequent.So with the white fog in front of you you figured youd have another epic boss fight to study and defeat. You wondered what sort of creature waited within. Whatever it may be you knew to hold back play defensive study its moves and take your time in defeating the single beast.As you step through the fog you see the monster. Nothing epic short even. It doesnt look like itd be that much of a proble...OH SHIT WHY ARE THERE DOGS?!Every boss up until that point is solo. Sure the Minotaur has archers but youre supposed to take those out before the fight  Their only purpose is to draw your attention to the ladder if you neglected to kill them.Solo fight after solo fight... And then BAM! Multiple creatures to deal with. Everything you learned from the game so far is useless.

192929,0,t1_cf0epao,Well I dont think it would be entirely detrimental and heres why surprising someone is an art and not having a message is a crutch.  Even the most wary individual can be caught offguard.  The game is not meant to be easy on anybody let alone invaders.For example lets say you know the area the host is in pretty well and you know theres a difficult fight up ahead.  Maybe the host knows or maybe he doesnt know about the fight.  It doesnt matter.  You can revive an enemy behind him and just have the enemy stand there or move up a little but not attack yet.  Then when the player engages in the fight maybe he performs a tactical retreat or maybe not but you can always push the revived enemy into the room or hall behind him and suddenly he has to deal with his flank when he didnt expect to  which is almost certain death in a game like this.  He was probably expecting a normal invader to come rushing around the corner in front of him and oh boy was he mistaken.Going slow doesnt mean you are going to make it any easier for yourself against an invader.  The invaders are people too and are much craftier than NPCs.  After all if a player cant be crafty and tricksy in a covenant with Pixie in the title then a player may want to switch over to something a little easier .,darksouls,cf0ey0g,1,t5_2sazo

For my second playthrough I had to use arrows to take out the left orb.I think the boss despite looking really cool sucks though. Apparently it was one of the last parts of the game to be made and so was rushed and a look at the files showed that initially it was going to move around.

268276,0,t3_1x5s0v,I saw of of these guys in the Undead Parish once. Or rather I didnt see him. I was doing some balder knight farming runs and I went to go pull the three in the chapel when I took what I can only describe as a magic shotgun blast to the back. Having already gotten the attention of all three balders as was my custom I panicked a little and sprinted back the side if the chapel leading to Andre. Luckily the evil vagrant was slow relative to the balder knights and allowed me to drink an estus to repair my sliver of health. I was barely able to take out the knights in my panicked state and ran out of estus I know thats casul. Then the vagrant caught up to me and shotgunned at me again. Luckily I was able to dodge it and kill the little spiny crab looking thing. It gave me a humanity. I didnt even know what in the hell it was for the longest time. So thats my vagrant story XD,darksouls,cf8kf9h,3,t5_2sazo

And in the second part of the fight Ornsteins AOE jump is smaller than Smoughs so one dodge back will easlilly get you out of his range. For the normal attacks just stick close to him and dodge to his left side your right and block whenever he tries to jump back and slash at the same time. ,darksouls,cf8nksv,2,t5_2sazo

272480,0,t1_cf8xgbo,I intentionally selfspawn them. Theres no direct mechanic for it its just that abandoned Vagrants can be sent to a connected world again so theyre not just created and sent to  person as a onetimeonly thing unless it gets killed.    I cant control the actions of other online players nor which connected players they target so its all about hoping the people who receive your vagrants dont find them and kill them and they have to randomly target you back by coincidence. So I spam connected worlds with them until I get lucky and happen to have one of mine return. Waiting for a long time by a vagrant spawn point without actively trying to make one probably wont help for a couple reasons.    The process is like this     Evil Vagrants  double suicide to lose a large amount of soft humanity check the nearest spawn location. Do this as many times as it takes to work and use the duplication glitch on a firekeeper soul to keep the humanity coming.     Good Vagrants  drop one or two of a known working item then abandoning it by suiciding or warping back to the bonfire. Check the nearest spawn location. Do it until it works... if youre doing things legitimately you probably need to stockpile Transient Curses or Purging Stones since these are the only items that work that you can buy an infinite amount of. You also cant pick up any Drift Bag Items you have return to you along the way.    Theres no indication that lost souls can cause vagrants.

283659,0,t3_1xcqan,As for the regular snakemen try to dodge them or block them with a heavy shield. If you can roll relatively fast dodging them is fairly easy. If you have heavier armor use a heavier shield a greatshield of some sort if you have the strength. If you know how to parry some of their attacks are also very viable for that but do note you cannot parry with a greatshield.As for the snake sorceress on the bridge time it so you can get in close before she can get another shot off  this means pretty much running across the bridge although you can stop for a second in the middle if the timing seems too tricky. Also when she changes from shooting to melee mode she does a short hissing animation at first use this to your advantage and go in aggressively. She has little poise so keep hacking away at that point but do note her weapon causes bleed if she does get to hit you.Generally it is also advisable to have relatively upgraded weapons by this point although this is certainly not required. It does make things a lot easier.Another option is tackling some other area of the game in the meantime to level up learn things and get better equipment. There are probably several areas you can investigate that you have not been to yet.Above all dont give up! The very high point in the game for me must have been beating Sens Funhouse.

290645,0,t3_1xf5ae,Never noticed this very interesting. I have always considered the Xanthous headwear to be a covered parasitic growth.There is a deep lovecraftian undertone all of Izalith Chaos and the Xanthous king.First of all Xanthous King Jeremiah is rather clearly a reference to the entity known as the King in Yellow who is said to wear yellow tatters and hide his true face behind a mask that might not be a mask. As has been pointed out xanthous indeed means yellow. This entity in itself is older than Lovecrafts writings dating to the late th century and the writings of R.W. Chambers namely his book titled indeed The King in Yellow.Chambers writings offer no really viable connections to Jeremiah but H.P. Lovecraft used the formers imagery relatively extensively in his own work.In Lovecrafts mythos there exists a character known as the high priest not to be described who wears a yellow silken mask hiding a face not wholly human. This character also talks to chaos using drums or a monotonous pipe residing in a monastery in the dreamlands in a cold landscape.In Lovecrafts writing an entity known as Azathoth is said to be the ultimate chaos whence all other demonic creatures sprung forth. I cannot help pondering about the similarity of the names Izalith and Azathoth especially considering both are known as sources of chaos both apparently served by a character that wraps itself in yellow clothes and hides its apparently inhuman face.As an interesting additional fact some people believe Lovecraft created the name of Azathoth combining the name of the demon Azazel and the town Anathoth which was coincidentally the home of the biblical prophet whose name was... Jeremiah. This is a real stretch and I would indeed consider it a coincidence entirely. That or From Software has way too much time on their hands.Finally I would not dare say all of what I have described above is true and intentional from the developers but certain coincidences make me believe it just might be so.Postscript Hm this also provides little to no additional thoughts on the parasitic wallhugger. I might have gotten a little carried away there sorry about that.,darksouls,cfaw1se,55,t5_2sazo

327130,0,t1_cfenpn5,I dunno thats not my understanding but its hard to say because theres no explicit reference to the pygmy in game outside of the intro video. Its heavily implied that he is your progenitor by Kaathe and slightly less heavily implied that he is Manus.So thinking about it heres my understandingWhen disparity came all beings outside of the dragons and serpents were basically humans. When the souls were discovered Gwyn became the first god gaining power over light and energy Nito became the first dead gaining power over mortality Izalith became the first witch gaining power over creation. Manus on the other hand found the soul and instead of harnessing its power he kept it. I think that he was the progenitor and primeval human because he was of the first generation of humans when the souls were discovered but I dont think he was necessarily the creator of all humans. Spoilers I believe that the Manus did not do anything with the soul just kept it safe throughout his whole life until he died and was buried. I think one of the serpents probably Frampt told the people of Oolacile that there was another Lord Soul that could be used to allow the Age of Fire to continue for longer and so they dug up Manus and tortured him in hope that he would give up the soul. However he consumed it it deformed him and spread throughout the world and the abyss is basically an ocean of humanity from the Dark Soul. Its possible that this is what created the undead curse but its hard to say.Obviously this is all wild speculation but this is how I see it.,darksouls,cfeoeog,1,t5_2sazo

331332,0,t3_1xsrsr,My thoughts      Aesthetically looks amazing. Really fucking nice. Mmm.      Everybody looks way too light on their feet. Running down a flight of stairs the character just gracefully falls to the bottom in no time at all.     Weapons didnt seem heavy. IMO one of the best aspects of Dark Souls is how differently the weapons behave but here even with the giant hammer it didnt look nearly as slow as it shouldve been.    Lack of enemy attacks  underwhelming AI. I assume this is just because its prealpha each enemy only has one or two different attacks but it was really stale hope to see a lot more in the final release.     Attacking the First Wardens shield still dealt a significant amount of damage. When you can put your characters shield up and take a miniscule amount of damage that feels pretty unfair.Id be keen to play this hopefully will have a variable difficulty setting I think this would be really fun on a punishing mode. With more enemy variety more enemies in general actually and better AI I think this has potential to be an awesome game.Goddamn does it look good though.,darksouls,cff43dh,2,t5_2sazo

362650,0,t3_1y7zi8,Ive got two for you. Similar to yours I ventured into the Tomb of the Giants. This was right after the gargoyles and I was extremely underequipped. My goal was the large divine ember for my Paladin character. And in order to not make it a hassle I rested at the bonfire inside the tomb so I could make suicide runs to get the ember. I was able to get it and everything but then I realized how fucked I was. You know how painful it is to get down the tomb at a low level? Multiply that by five to go back up. I had to go through a shit ton of giant skeletons that were repeatedly knocking me off ledges or sniping me with arrows and if I managed to get passed that I was greeted by an army of wheel skeletons. I legitimately thought I was stuck at that point. I had no poise a shield with shitty stability no ranged weapons and my best armor was a cleric robe. After a few unfortunate attempts it hit me I was a warrior of the sun. And holy shit did lightning spear save me. I was able to pick off the wheels one by one and made my way out of that forsaken tomb. Praise the motherfucking sun.. This one is a lot less exciting. I basically wanted to do an Indiana Jones run so my first priority was to get the whip falchion and pharis hat. To do this I basically had to go up blightown backwards at base level and then sneak my way past the hydra and assassinate pharis. And holy shit is that Hydra accurate with its spit. I cant tell you ho many times I fell off that fucking ladder. It was fun but extremely frustrating at the same time. I never managed to finish the playthrough anyways because using the whip is a lot less fun than it seems to be.,darksouls,cficrr3,1,t5_2sazo

399579,0,t1_cfm2y1m,I can see what youre saying with some of your points but I would like to point out a few things.gt However if that opponent kills you instantly with Great Combustion spam while you attack him for  damage no strategy is going to assist you. You will die and thats not what Dark Souls is about. Youre supposed to be able to use strategy to avoid dying. There should never be an opponent you have no chance against.The first encounter with Seath I feel is a good example of how this isnt true.  And thats an NPC experience.  This game very much embraces the idea of sometimes there really is nothing you could have done.  It then teaches you that there are alternatives to the method you were attempting.  You cannot fight him there and win.  Go around find another route do something different.gtIf success is impossible why try? Thats what cuts new players off from the game. They encounter something ruthless and completely unfair so they write the game off as bullshit. Ruthless and unfair is the first time you fight the gargoyles alone.  Or the first encounter with pikachu and snorlax.  This game hinges on ruthless and unfair.  It embraces it with open arms.  The frustration of the unfairness wasnt an unintended side effect it was an intentional part of the formula.  I think that something is forgotten with all of this.  That there is never a point in PVP where you have no options.  The boss fog is ALWAYS a way out.  The Way of White is there too for those who take the extremely little time to find it.  Fighting the invader isnt always an option but you never have zero options in PVP.  And that kind of thinking is exactly what makes Dark Souls an excellent game.  Players can learn a lot from early heavily one sided PVP.  It might be a hard lesson and some may turn their nose up to it because its not fair.  But those that want it bad enough will realize that just like dying to the gargoyles or being kicked off a cliff by a skeleton or being lighting bolted off of a thin bridge by a serpentman or eaten by a mimic that this isnt the end.  That you just have to change your plan accordingly.  Dark Souls was never intended to be fair.  Only difficult ruthless and unforgiving.   ,darksouls,cfm6k7i,1,t5_2sazo

Second of all when you go past the fog gate run forward until he jumps out of the building. Then run back and climb up the ladder to the left of the fog gate. Then once youre up there kill the  guys up there. Then once the Taurus Demon is below the tower do a plunging attack. Rforward on ps RTforward on Xbox It should get his health down to about half.

416523,0,t1_cfnv86m,Thats your opinion and youre welcome to it but the rules of speedrunning have already been virtually set in stone. I wouldnt really consider it breaking the game anyway. Things such as modifying the source code of the game using trainers to boost statsmoneyetc are closer to the description of breaking the game. These are not allowed.Anything that can be accomplished in the games currently updated state is allowed moveswap and duping are the big ones. These are done because they make a run faster  which is the entire point. However breaking the game or not what speedrunners do is exceedingly difficult. I am actually more impressed with runners using moveswap since its a very difficult glitch to perform especially to get right in one or two tries which is necessary for them.,darksouls,cfnxsmy,2,t5_2sazo

476103,0,t3_1zi1nw,Upgrade system is very similar to Dark souls but just with more options.  It actually allows you to customize your weapon to your build a bit more.  So in Dark souls if you wanted to upgrade a dex weapon you had to pick one with good dex scaling.  In Demon souls you can pick a weapon and upgrade it along the Sharp path and make it a dex weapon.  Youre somewhat limited in that only certain weapons will accept certain upgrade paths but its a lot more freedom than Dark Souls.Theres a big chart here but I agree it can be confusing if you dont know what youre looking for.  Basic rule of thumb is to determine what stat you want to be your damage stat then pick upgrades for it. Or do what I did as a newb and use Dragon for pure fire damage which lets you focus on healthstam.,darksouls,cfudw4j,1,t5_2sazo

485772,0,t1_cfvg89i,Most dodges in video games are in fact moves with Iframes.  Backsteps in fighting games dodgerolls dodges in every character action game ever etc.  This is fairly common.Specifically in Dark Soul because of the size of a claymores swing hitbox the only effective way to truly dodge it without Iframes is to always be outside of its swing radius.  Removing Iframes from rolls gives a massive advantage to people using larger weapons because an opponent with a shorter weapon cant get in and attack fast enough.Now this is what gave those weapons devastating advantage in historical battles.

502830,0,t3_1zvs5i,I had some trouble with her too playing a similar build though I think Im close to SL now so wouldve been around  when I fought her?  She was appropriately trickydifficult for a completely optional boss.I found the easiest way to kill her was to twohand my weapon pretty much the entire time and stick to the snowy areas of the arena.  When I saw her approach Id do a jumping attack forwardR and run away whether it hit or not.  Youll often get smacked once in return especially if you miss so you really need to hustle.  Im well above  weight so Im fatrolling around and still managed to avoid it.I found that trying to hide behind my shield while waiting for the bleed meter to tick down wasnt very effective  I didnt take any damage but her swings eat a ton of stamina and eventually youll get hit and if she procs the bleed damage bonus its almost guaranteed to be fatal... it looked like it was  or maybe even  of my health when it procd.If you have any bleed meter activity just kite her in circles until it fades and feel free to spam flasks to stay at .I did it with a Greataxe.  It occurs to me that using a greatshield like Black Iron Shield and a spear of some sort maybe the Lightning Spear you got from the Mimic in Anor Londo? would be the safest way of doing things  just keep your shield up and jab once or twice and roll away between her swings.The nice thing is that she has almost no HP.

599618,0,t3_210gc0,Heres what we know about Bonfires and Humanity in Dark Souls. They each have Firekeepers whose souls are entwined with a writhing mass of humanity. If the Firekeeper dies the Bonfire goes out they are linked permanently and irrevocably.. Bonfires are linked to the First Flame.. Bonfires are kindled by humanity.. Humanity and Souls are naturally drawn to each other info via Crystal Soul Mass. The Soul can exist independent of Humanity Undead and Humanity can exist independent of the Soul Humanity Sprites. Join the two together and you have a Living being. As evidence according to the Crestfallen Warrior a Hollowed Undead thats still has its mental faculties can steal the Humanity from other stronger Undead to regain their Living appearance.EpicNameBro suggested that Gwyn sacrificed humans to maintain the First Flame. More specifically he sacrificed their Humanity by feeding it to the Flames and perhaps even the Bonfires. Burn away a humans Humanity and all thats left is the body and soul  an Undead. The Darksign might be a symptom of Gwyns attempt to kindle the First Flame with people. When that didnt work he used himself.For curses if you read the description of the item that Cures you of a curse you will see that Curses cannot be broken they can only be transferred to another. Hence the stillliving skull inside that item. It takes the curse off of you. This is why Ingward needs humanity from you to cure your curse  hes attaching the curse to said humanity.,darksouls,cg8fhqo,11,t5_2sazo

The spider shield is your BFF against poison and toxic and you can get it from above the giant rat in the depths. Also you need purple moss clumps and blooming purple moss clumps for when you do get poisonedtoxicd. You can get them for free by killing the shrub monsters that you can find past the titanite demon under the blacksmith near the path to Sens. Its also a good idea to use a kindled bonfire so you have more estus and armor with extra poison resistance will also help you out. A ranged weapon is nice but not vital. Just keep your shield up try not to fall off any cliffs and be patient. As with most things in Dark Souls if you rush you die. Have fun!,darksouls,cgg86mc,4,t5_2sazo

Leveling up your character is important but its better in the long run to focus on using your souls to reinforce your weapons early on so you can get a high damage output.As for the boss battles Id wait on fighting the wolf Sif.  Try and take out the Moonlight Butterfly first.  Im not sure if you noticed or not but there is a summon sign under the staircase in the tower that goes to the Moonlight Butterfly.  You can summon Witch Beatrice and she does pretty massive damage with Soul Arrows in the fight and should make it much easier for you.As for New Londo Id wait on going there until after youve finished Anor Londo.

836135,0,t1_cgz6465,If we assume giving the soul of Artorias to Ciaran is the way the lore was meant to go then possibly someone took the place of Artorias or whoever did the history of Artorias got confused because of the soul. Its safe to assume that the soul of Artoias would be left near or with his grave and his grave is near New Londo and that is where Oolacile once was. So maybe whoever is giving the information about Artorias got confused because Artorias grave is close to where the corruption from the abyss took place but Oolacile is no longer there. Instead New Londo is. So instead of the historian saying Oolacile he says New Londo because New Londo is where Oolacile is and because the Dark Wraiths are assumed to have existed while Artorias was fighting against the corruption from the abyss mistakes have been made and whoever gave the information on Artorias lore got it wrong.,darksouls,cgzbkeb,1,t5_2sazo
838132,0,t1_cgz76wk,I dont see the contradiction. The Primordial Serpent manipulates the citizens of Oolacile into awakening Manus source of the abyss. The Primordial Serpent convinces the Four Kings to recruit an army of Darkwraiths spreading chaos in New Londo. Lord Gwyn takes notice of New Londo and sends Artorias to fight the Darkwraiths. Artorias is unable to save New Londo but learns that the source of the abyss is actually in Oolacile. Artorias journeys to Oolacile but cannot defeat Manus and succumbs to the darkness. Gwyn being at his weakest this happens when the fire is fading away desperately decides to flood New Londo to stop the Darkwraiths. The Chosen Undead defeats Manus stopping the Abyss.,darksouls,cgzjr6u,2,t5_2sazo

You can walk around them and to the edge of the building to the right of the stairs. Hug the wall and drop down. Go right from there and youll find stairs to the left a little ways ahead. Run straight up the stairs and forwards and youll be in the rom with te big slimey bug thing and a dark wraith. You dont have to fight them so run to the far left and youll be attacked by a ghost. Run down the little walkway and youll see the fog. Get through and down the stairs a little so they can hit you. Now youre ready to fight them. Make sure to equip the ring. They take lots of damage from magic so use sorceries if you can. If it takes too long to kill one another will spawn and another and another if it continues. If you have sorceries or other magic try to stay out of range of their attacks. They deal lota of damage but are fairly easy to dodge. Good luck!,darksouls,ch1chq0,1,t5_2sazo

861210,0,t1_ch257ql,If you played dark souls first a few things may be jarring though. I dont think jump attacks are a thing standing in swamp causes you to stumble if you try to roll plunging attacks dont exist and poise does not exist so just go with light armour because being able to roll fast is way more important. Demons Souls also lets you mantle over some low obstacles unlike the later two souls games in which Insurmountable Waist High Fence is in full effect at all times.Also there are only two tiers of roll fast and fat. The breakpoint is  equip load however instead of  of Dark Souls.Also you have an item weight as well as the equip weight so you can only carry so much with you. Stockpile Thomas is very important. Dont worry about holding on to upgrade materials the smiths can use them from Thomas inventory and those upgrade materials quickly start to weigh and awful lot anyway. Seriously if you dont want to miss out on item pickups store away anything you arent going to use.Having a spare weapon or two may be advisable especially if someone invades and decides to use the Scraping Spear because they want to be a colossal dick.All of the games five areas are pretty selfcontained and there are good reasons to go to all of them at any given point. It might be easier if you beat all the first areas first before trying to take on any of the second areas but dont be afraid to go somewhere else if one area is giving you a lot of problems.Edit Oh and Crystal Lizards are assholes.,darksouls,ch26b00,17,t5_2sazo

978293,0,t1_chfhdcd,To this question I understand what youre saying. If the devs dont say its canon than can we really say.  But this is the inherant nature of Dark Souls.  It is a story one builds themselves.  You can say that only the real canon is the only true aspects of the game but dark souls is about discovery.  This is a story that I discovered through my play time and interaction with dark souls.  It is what I believe is what happened.  That is why canon or not I tried to make this sound less like a by the facts story and more like a tale from word of mouth.  Because it is.  and that is just as true as any canon material you could find.So no it is not official unless the devs have said.  I took the relative information from the game and made a story by connecting the dots.  But it is up to you to decide if you believe it or have your own things to add to the story.  Dark Souls is about building the world as a community.  Without the ambiguity such as the true background of Kirk we cant have lore like this.  True lore that asks its player base to question and use their imagination.So find your favorite character.  Look at who they are in context of the game.  And then talk about them.  Tell you experience of them their story.  It is why I love this game so much.  It so so community driven especially in this form.  Make the stories my friend.  It is what the game is about.

1077765,0,t3_26g5pf,Like others have said this is gonna be a tough build to pull off but it is doable. IMO it will make progressing very difficult for him without you being there almost the entire time. I quickly threw together this build on mugenmonkey just as an example build.A bow would be decent for supporting damage on boss fights but it wont be stellar. The Bandits Knife will be great for backstabs and other criticals though.A shortbow from the Burgs Undead Merchant should tide him over until he gets Pharis bow in Darkroot Garden. He can use whatever thieflooking armor he wants but staying at fast roll would be ideal. I also threw in the Longsword and Heater Shield for the unavoidable times when enemies will aggro onto him. They can be obtained early on and a new player being stuck with just a dagger and a bow against aggrod enemies would be a rough time. If he wants to avoid using elemental damage for his roleplay replacing the longsword with a Balder Side Sword later on would work well with his Dex scaling. It might be best if you dropped one for him though as farming it can take a really long timeFor rings I would recommend going with the Hornet Ring for critical damage but he could substitute for the Ring of Fog for RP purposes if he wishes. Have fun with it though thats the key. I hope this works out for you guys.,darksouls,chqsn1f,1,t5_2sazo

1133775,0,t1_chx424p,I second this but be warned in DkS dogding and bows are immature when compared to DkS. For instance you can only dodge in four directions no diagonal action like in .Also in Dks shield is a choice. I never used one never needed one dodging is great there. In DkS you are pushed to have a shield otherwise you are making things very difficult for yourself that could be a good thing though. Not only because of the crappy dodging system but because of the framedrops in many areas Blighttown New Londo Ruins Hydra fight etc. It is safer to have the shield up than rolling and dealing with the lag.I would recommend a dexfaith build. Shield up and use the lightning spear together with lightning miracles. Bows to aggro from the distance. ,darksouls,chx5qvc,1,t5_2sazo

Eventually after so many tortured deaths you lose your mind and go hollow. Again this is exactly the same thing that happened before to your predecessor in Gwyn he cast himself into the flame to rekindle the First Flame. The flame burned the new fuel into a low smolder where you find it. Gwyn is now the Lord of Cinder. This is both symbolic a literal his repeated deaths and loss of souls and humanity have left him hollow and as far as being a fuel source is concerned hes spent.Thats what will happen to you eventually when you link the flames. ,darksouls,ci31sit,3,t5_2sazo

1191416,0,t1_ci3n4dz,Im going to quote from a comment uMiltrivd made some where else in this thread because Im too tired to repeat the same shit over and over.gt The free games are because its a paid service not the other way around.Hulu Netflix and Twitch have their own servers nothing to do with MicrosoftSony servers.PC gets free online because its an open platform. Steam isnt PC. They are just a vendor each game has to host their own servers. At most Steam gives developers a deal by using their servers for matchmaking. The only way would be for each game to charge for online capabilities which some do WoW Diablo III the few other paid MMORPGs. If you make an FPS and charge for online then people will find another FPS in contrast they find some other ways to milk people mappacks meaningless DLC cosmetics so its not that different.The reason they do it its because yes servers cost money but this cost was traditionally sustained by the console makers because they would get revenue back through console sales and licenses. Now Microsoft went and charged for something that was traditionally free and it worked hell even better some people defend that model. Sony saw that and wth if Microsoft can do it so they can. Whos gonna oppose? No one because its a closed platform theres no alternatives you got the console and you need the service if you wanna play online. They do it because they can.To add to this Microsoft is a software manufactured first and they only recently started making hardware. The Xbox One isnt even a drop in the ocean that is their profits. Sony on the other hand makes a lot more than just consoles. Even so the only reason they started charging for their service is because they saw Microsoft getting away with it.,darksouls,ci3nipd,10,t5_2sazo

1231089,0,t1_ci8019p,The leveling system is gear based as far as what your character can dohow much armor or damage they have. There are some things that you get from carving monstersrewards from quests that can be used towards resources but generally speaking they are kept separate. You can download some stuff from the downloadable quest section one of which is like  resource points I believe. Once they give you that to start with it makes it much easier to keep yourself sustained throughout the game. Later on you will also unlock a cook who can prepare you a meal before going out for a quest which can give you extra health and other small buffs like that. Good call on the lance. I never could get  comfortable with a lancemyself but they are great weapons and are considered one of the best classes of weapon in the series. One thing to know is that the armor you wear can give you skills that activate after you get  points in that skill across the armor youre wearing.

1259985,0,t3_28igzo,The only thing easily if you have k souls available Id know at this point in time would be the Stone Armour Set in Darkroot Garden just after Alvina on the left side of the ruins a little hidden on the wall. Three things though  a. in order to get there fast youd need k souls for the Crest from the Blacksmith  b. in order to get there cheap youd need to run past the Hydra which will most definately end in death but fighting it is also an option I think the ladder was at that lake right?  c. in order to wear the stone set youd want to get Havels Ring as to not fat roll but you have to enter the tower at the hydras place shortest way I think and thus need the master key and to actually defeat him which well could be hard.

Ring of Fog is another good ring as it lowers the distance monsters will see you but it has no effect on bosses so if you do use it remember to swap it out for something before boss fights.

1461751,0,t3_2awi8w,I did this as a mage so Ill offer some advice. First off go pick up some better spells from logan. Homing soul mass  greater heavy soul arrow and soul spear. I think soul spear is  int so you may want to grind that. Soul spear is going to help you for taking out one of them while theyre weaker. If youre not using solaire be prepared for a tough fight. Id recommend doing skinny first as fatass is easier to use the pillars with.   Going in pikachu usually starts off with a dashing attack. Shield up Dodge around and move off to the side.  I recommend using a backing up strategy. Back up around the arena and keep the pillars close to you to hinder fatty. Watch pikachu for a while and fire off a soul spear and using homing soul mass to hit him when he gets close. Once hes out of the way fatty will supercharge. You mainly need to be careful of his running attack which is bs. Just keep a pillar between you and him at all times. Also beware that his hammer can block magic its apparently not a part of his hitbox.  Above all take your time. you only have a limited number of spells its Important that you dont waste them on a miss or smoughs hammer. ,darksouls,cizi89v,1,t5_2sazo

A chaos notched whip  off hand that can still parry but cant be parried is ridiculous to most players.

I really like the halberd because its comparatively light for the range and damage and is what Ive been using for most of this playthrough. Im coming back from Ds as I said where SL doesnt matter as much and soul vessels are a thing so Im a little wary of leveling up in general. But if I use low base offensive stats STRDEX and focus on getting up the elemental paths I should see some solid damage output right? What is the typical stat spread in Dark Souls  at SL ?Im a big fan of the barbed sword for PvE Ill have to see how it performs in PvP its a great compliment to the Gargoyles Halberd.

When you first log in it takes a little bit for your pool to fill up or for you to find a pool which is why it may take a little for your summon sign to even appear in other peoples worlds. They you have to hope that they are in the same area as you looking for help and human and that the summon wont fair on their end.

The demons really have their own kingdom in Lost Izalith with the Bed of Chaos as its jewel so maybe they have a culture and military all their own! Imagine the Demon Firesage or even the Bed commanding their troops. I think that the demons in Anor Londo are infiltrators or saboteurs.

Theres plenty of items lying throughout the start of the game to correct that though.Weapons found in the first few areas can carry you thoughout the game if you upgrade them. In fact one thing Dark Souls  does better than  in my opinion is having most items on corpses as opposed to being tied to enemy farming.

2258133,0,t1_clqb78q,Im a bit behind but I think I can give at least a fair explanation on world tendency.  character tendency might be a bit less fleshed out though.  Lets start with world tendency.  If youre playing online its not going to matter as much because as soon as you get online its going to reflect the server median.  So if a lot of people have been doing things that push the world towards pure white world tendency your world tendency will reflect that and similarly with pure black world tendency.  Anyways for the most part world tendency can be ignored especially for a first play through.Basically what world tendency does is the blacker the world tendency the harder the enemies are.  Also their item drop rate is increased.  Similarly as the world tendency shades towards white enemies become easier but they dont drop their random drops as often.  Sometimes if you get closer towards pure black there will be more enemies as well in certain areas.In addition in the further in white your world tendency goes your hp in soul form is increased and the damage you do is also increased.  But enemies drop less souls.  In addition certain events can only occur when the world is in pure white or pure black wt.  Certain areas that were inaccessible before will be made accessible when you reach the correct wt.  Not huge areas but oft times the areas have npcs you can talk to or kill or some sort of item that you might enjoy.  WT is changed in a few ways.  You can cause it to shade toward white by .  Killing the area boss.  killing the dragons in the first world.  Killing named black phantomsinvaders.  killing primeval demons only appear when the world tendency is near pure black  Im probably missing a few ways to change it towards white but you can google that if you want.  World tendency can be shaded towards black by.  Dying in human form in a world note that dying in spirit form doesnt affect wt at all.  Killing old king doran not to worry hed wipe the floor with you anyways most likely.  killing body forms of named npcs.  they only appear in pwwt so you probably dont need to worry about that. Generally since theres so many ways to increase wt and not very many to decrease it your wt is often going to be shaded towards white so you dont have to worry about it much unless youre specifically going for pbwt.  An easy way to keep it there is to simply suicide in the nexus every time you beat a boss as beating bosses will cause you to return to body form.  Either that or just dont die.Again though since wt is reset to the server median every time you log in unless youre doing marathon playthroughs youre going to want to do any specific messing with wt offline so that its easier to get to where you want to go.    Character tendency is easier to understand.  Kill named black phantomsinvaders to increase your character tendency towards white and kill nice npcs to shade it towards black.  You do more damage as an invading black phantom with a pbct but more damage as a blueto regular enemies in your own world with pwct.  Also you can get a ring when you hit pure white by talking to the monumental.  I think thats about it but if youve got more questions shoot me a pm and Ill try to clear up any confusion.  ,darksouls,clqtreg,2,t5_2sazo

If the other guy also have a bleed weapon like a katana and good bleed resist then youre screwed over as his bleed would build up your bleed meter along with the self bleed.The Great Scythe can be bluffed so it can inflict large amounts of damage along with its own bleed. Also has a longer reach.If you plan to be lowleveled for that area of pvp then use lifehunt as you might not have high enough faith or intelligence for bluffs.

2412621,0,t3_2n2t6b,I was pretty disappointed in DS thought you wouldnt know it considering Ive played it for almost  hours. I think the mechanics are much better and more fun in DS its more about your reaction time whereas DS is more balanced in that things like blocking and parrying are slower so you have to be more methodical about combat. It works better for pvp but I think it really hurts the pve game. I recently finished all the DLCs which were excellent but I was constantly frustrated by the controls. Im now back on DS and it feels soooo much better. Basically when I die in DS i think i can do better that was stupid but in DS i curse the game and get really angry because I feel like the game was designed with faster mechanics in mind.Also the world of DS isnt nearly as interesting. The levels are all supposed to be hundreds of miles away form each other but there are just these boring hallways connecting them  and they never really shortcut to one another. Its a very linear more gamey experience. Its more about a sequence of challenges rather than a world that is fun to explore.

When you fight him hes not only injured but missing an essential part of this character his shield. Not only is he corrupted by the Abyss and fighting against the corruption see the removed dialogue and lore Im referring to but also down an arm and yet he still gives everyone a damn good run for their money until they face him several times and finally put him out of his misery. Can you imagine fighting Artorias if he was not only sane but also had his sword shield and had Sif accompany him in the fight?

The ranged AOE you can stand next to him but the one where he slams his weapon down vertically you need some spacing to avoid.Priscilla just stand on the side with snow and look for footprints.  You only need to stagger her to remove invisibility and then its gone for the rest of the attempt.  She is a push over at this point.With Gwyn you can get him in an AI loop with Great Combustion I believe.  I dont know how you do it but he basically turns into a trivial fight where you do a GC he dodges you do a GC and he dodges and you do a GC and then he falls over.Most of the large bosses in the game benefit from unlocked play as well.  Its well worth learning to at least passably do it for cases that it helps significantly like multiple enemies.Ceaseless is my bane lately.  I got used to the generally nonlingering hitbox attacks from DS and tried to do it on Ceaseless.  It doesnt work unless you have extremely good timing.  Just run radially prior to his attacks.

Short of sinking  points into Resistance or throwing away all of your titanite slabs read dont do this use those carefully theres not a whole lot that you cant work around easily. The game applauds experimentation in that regard.And honestly on the whole your stats themselves are surprisingly far less important than the weapons and their reinforcement level.

If it wasnt intended by the developers and isnt part of the official system I try to stay away from it as much as possible regardless of its ever so tempting usage. But if others want to use it thats totally up to their own discretion makes no difference to me unless youve got clearly modded stats like some SL characters Ive ran into... Seriously SL and over k health? I mean come one people get creative with modding at least! Like I said To each their own. Even though I specifically mentioned using CheatEngine in my previous comment you could easily get to a high SL while using the duplication glitch on a high level Boss Soul to get k souls repeatedly.

Of course Oreo and Smores have a godlike theme as do the Four Kings Seath Sif and Gwyn. But all the demons have themes that just kinda grate on me. And the DLC themes were... meh.

However news had sprung up that a ring containing the spirit of the Evil Eye existed somewhere within an ancient and untouched domain known as Lordran. Adamant that he would end this beast for good he set out with a Straight sword on his back and a Tower Kite Shield on his good arm out to this mysterious Lordran where he would later be kidnapped by a group of Way of White members and locked within the Northern Undead Asylum due to his longkept secret that he was an undead and he had been defying and hiding from the Way of White for ages. When he awoke he was greeted from above by a familiar Astora noble whom he had aided during the Evil Eyes assault on the Castle Valium Astoras capital.

At one point he had me to the point of near death but instead of finishing me off he backed up and waited for me to attack. So I simply drank some estus and fought on. If he had his wits about him then he would have seen my low health and tried to be offensive instead of so reactive in his style.

2704890,0,t1_cnbi5uz,Im not going to debate the weapon or rolling systems I dont really pvp much in it so I dont really test it out as much but I will say that the level design and the openness vs linear is sort of arguable. Dark Souls  may have done a better job with the design of each level to give a sense of scale but there are just as many linear levels in Dark Souls  as well. Dark Souls  feels like more of a journey compared to the second because theres way more leg work and you dont use fast travel until way later. And in terms of boss battles I didnt really find that many of them that much more creative than Dark Souls  Dark Souls  has some pretty lazy bosses as well. In some aspects Dark Souls  us actually close to Demons Souls than anything. The whole thing can be compared and contrasted for days and which is better blah blah blah but in reality for the question of Should I get Dark Souls  of course you should they are both great and just because its slighty not as good as the first doesnt mean you should avoid it. Its like watching A New Hope but the not wanting to watch Empire Strikes back. The whole Souls Franchise is enjoyable for its own way.,darksouls,cnbjap4,0,t5_2sazo

2747202,0,t3_2rhp9r,I beat him with a Black Knight Sword  Artorias Greatshield Mask of the Child Havels Ring and Ninja Flip Ring. I was naked otherwise so I could proc the Ninja Flip Ring. Artorias Greatshield and Mask of the Child makes it trivial to block his physical attacks all day long. All of his fire attacks can kill you dead within a second even if you block because it deals so much stamina damage so you have to learn his tells. Some of his fire attacks require you to run away some require you to roll to the side or roll backwards some leave you an opening to run up and punish him.The best strategy is to get in that mid range where he is most likely to use his headbutt and tailswipe because those are the weakest of his attacks easiest to block and easiest to roll through.You want to get to a point where you can roll through his headbutt with your invincibility frames and get in two hits. Be ready to clear out after those two hits because he will usually jump into the air and blast his AOE fire attack.Its also important to learn when to lock on and when to unlock. His AOE fire attack and his dashing attack tend to punish you more for remaining locked on because it is hard to escape or hard to counter attack.Just like any other boss you should always be trying to flank him. Flanking to his left gives you more space to evade his arc fire breath since it always comes from the right side of the screen to the left. You can really punish this attack if you get past his head and hit him with a twohanded attack.Also his signature attack will lift you up in the air and do a smallmoderate damage but more importantly you will be hit with a debuff that double the damage you take. Youll see a red eye floating over your head for about a minute. I always just run around and dodge his attacks until the debuff expires. Not worth trying to attack him because he will oneshot you.Kalameet is hard because he has five different fire attacks four different physical attacks and his signature move. And a couple of the attacks have tells that are very similar to others. For example his dash attack that leaves him vulnerable for a counterattack is very similar to his dash attack that he immediately follows up with an arc fire.You might have to go powerlevel to get your stats up. I spent half an hour killing the Phalanx in the Painted World to get my Endurance up to the point that I could Ninja Roll while wielding my sword and greatshield.Of course every build is different in which case disregard what Ive said about equipment...but the tactics remain the same.Personally I hate trying to use arrows and crossbows because it is so timeconsuming.One final thought his fire breath is dark magic so it deals a combination of physical and magical damage.,darksouls,cngcg28,1,t5_2sazo

Of course Bloodborne better darn well have daytime bits because a whole game set at night would get boring real fast.Anyway part of why I like Undead BurgParishAsylum so much is because how similar they are visually to games like Ico and Shadow of the Colossus. They have a mysterious halffantasy halfapocalyptic feeling to them. And Im a sucker for vast stone and brick structures. Side note Im still planning on playing Vagrant Story and PoP Sands of Time which apparently also have similar design.Can someone tell me if Demons Souls has an area that looks similar to Dark Souls early game?

3076543,0,t3_2vecn5,Surprisingly adequate considering a lot of these posts. My thoughts would be if youre going to go SL  might as well go SL  and put the extra points into either END or VIT. Few more END points will allow you to switch up your gear should you ever want to. You might consider switching to a lighter shield as well the Heater Shield at  weight units frees you up for almost  more units of stuff while still fast rolling. With that you could pump more into Poise or add another weapon in case you want a break from the Dark Hand. Lastly Flash Sweat while cool I mean youd likely end up finding this out for yourself but odds are you wont find it as useful as you want it to be.

3166047,0,t1_coq1wnz,Normal  is about the best you can do without finding an Ember for Andre.  You can find the Large Ember up to Normal  in Depths and you shouldve found the Divine Ember up to Divine  after killing the butterfly.  Divine weapons are very useful for Catacombs and can also be very strong if you have good Faith but otherwise you shouldnt focus on them.Generally speaking you should just use the Normal upgrade path unless you have a reason for not going that path.  Raw weapons will do more damage early on but fall behind fairly quickly.  Crystal weapons do a lot more damage but eventually break and cant be repaired.Fire Chaos and Lightning weapons dont scale with stats at all cant be buffed and are subject to resistances on the enemy a Lightning weapon wont be very useful against an enemy with high Lightning defense.Magic Enchanted Divine and Occult weapons all sacrifice StrengthDexterity scaling in exchange for bonus magic damage and bonus Intelligence and Faith scaling respectively.  Theyre good options if youll be investing heavily in Intelligence or Faith but are otherwise subpar.This early in the game though Normal  is your best and only real option.  Make sure your shield is upgraded too!  Just do the Normal  path for your shield as well.,darksouls,coq5r9t,1,t5_2sazo

It seems to be a specific set of ladders that can cause the issue and all the ladders that have the issue can just be avoided entirely by jumping down instead.  None of the ladders for lethal falls seem to cause it for me.Also the bonfire issue is mostly about reversing humanity and kindling where your character changes position and the bonfire menu is supposed to open again.  If you start one of those animations before your character has finished sitting down the bonfire menu might fail to reopen and youll have to ALTF out of the game.

3350417,0,t1_cpa25fb,What a strange thing to say considering the  lords are the easier bosses of the game in DkS at least in NG.  The real threats were OampS Gwyn Manus and Kalameet.Nito was always the weakest because hes painfully slow and takes a good  seconds to pick himself up after his lunge attack. I almost feel like his speed was determined with consideration you would have to fight his skeletons at the same time which you didnt since a divine weapon perma killes them or if you forget Nito repeatedly kills them anyways with that dark self destruct explosion he loves to spam so much. The  or  small skeletons by themselves are actually more dangerous than Nito by himself.Seath has a blind spot under him that you can abuse if you can bait him into doing his left to right or right to left sweeping breath attack for the entire fight. Seath is the one boss I can consistently nodamage because of this. Also Seath had another gimmick to him since he was blind or something so using a slumbering dragoncrest ring made it so he couldnt find you with his only other sense. Never tried it but I remember reading something like that.Bed of Chaos is mostly the same but I dont remember if I needed flash sweat for the fire pillars due to low hp and narrow hall leading to the chaos bug or if fire res gear was enough.I do know however that four kings can be tanked on a sl just like any other normal build due to the nature of their attacks. Most slashes they do will hit you with the hilt if you are hugging them and do severely reduced damage and only their forward stab will still do high damage since the blade hits but for the most part you wont need to dodge since they only do full damage from a range although by NG a sl cant tank their hits anymore which caused me a lot of grief since I had only ever beaten them by tanking so I had to learn their moveset from scratch without much room for error.Also a SL could potentially do more damage than a str or dex build in DkS due to the existence of the Chaos Path. A maxed chaos reinforced club absolutely wrecked pretty much every late game boss and it could be one handed as well so you could block with the godly heater shield or fairy flip to victory with DWGRs extreme iframes although even the fast roll  load was extremely good. You also drink Estus very fast in DkS. But seriously chaos path was very strong since it didnt rely on player stats. Closest thing to that in DkS is raw I think? Which wasnt anything close to a chaos equivalent for a sl. Its been a while though.DkS in comparison to all the sweet stuff you had that I just mentioned makes you feel extremely handicapped. The iframes are horrible on a base adp sl so dodging needs extreme precision and timing. That broadsword needs to be H at sl. I dont even remember anything besides a dagger that could be h at sl and the best shield available to a sl is the blue wooden shield if I recall correctly which had like  phys reduction and  stability. The low adp also meant really slow estus chugging so finding a moment to heal also became harder. Having done a onerun in all  Souls games I still stand by DkS being the hardest. I was able to even do the DLC bosses in  but I remember getting pretty burnt out by the end of  so I only know for sure I did the st DLC and know for sure I did not do the rd oneand I dont really want to. Been a while so cant remember if I finished what I started in the second dlc.All in all the fact that I feel  is easier might boil down to the fact that I had many  many more hours logged as I had played it for years and knew the game inside and out before doing a onerun whereas in  I think I beat the game twice before going for it. ,darksouls,cpa67uc,1,t5_2sazo

This fight is really a race to deal enough damage to kill a king before the next one spawns so a good strategy is to put on heavy armour and just tank all their attacks while constantly attacking them havels set is the best for this since the magic defense will let you tank the hits without taking mucg damage and the poise will let you heal right next to them without worrying about being stagered ,darksouls,cpbsqws,2,t5_2sazo

3538695,0,t1_cpv6nlc,Before the game was patched the dark wood grain ring allowed one to flip like a ninja if their weight was below . Basically a midroll setup could use it unlike today where you have to have a light rolling set up in order to flip. People abused this by stacking poise with havels wearing the mother mask for that extra bit of health and the use of DWGR made them very hard to hit. Luckily this was patched but that wont stop any hackers from using a similar set up.,darksouls,cpvmtnq,1,t5_2sazo
3543525,0,t3_30viad,The game takes a very unobtrusive approach to telling you the story most of the easily accessible story is told through item descriptions particularly boss souls. Also talk to people multiple times until they start to repeat themselves since they wont tell you everything the first time you talk to them and for many of their quests you need to exhaust their dialogue at certain locations.Keep following the path you are on at the moment its the right way and things will become a little clearer after you ring the second bell. If you are having trouble figuring out where the second bell is there are two paths the areas that are the first along those paths are the Lower Undead Burg it has dogs in it and the other is the Valley of the Drakes. Dont worry about the second bell until after you ring the one in the Undead Parish though. Part of this game is the mystery if you are still confused at the end there are plenty of lore vidoes on youtube but Id reccommend going through the game blind up to you though!Edit You will get told more story after the second bell though.,darksouls,cpw6nn8,3,t5_2sazo

Compared to Bloodborne their health seems minuscule. I mean they have low enough health that there are one shots on a lot of bosses. Which is extremely astonishing in my opinion. And some of the bosses dont even have a lot of health theyre just hard. Like Artorias and Gwyn. Neither have a WHOLE lot of health. But some do have quite a bit. But I dont feel like its too much.

3593668,0,t3_31hnjv,You are going to die.. a lot. But somewhere around halfway it is going to click. You will be able to see enemy attacks more clearly and react accordingly. You will stop dying to terrain as much you will be faster at menuing you will make better choices in shorter time. But that is later. For now  you will just need to take it slow. Explore. Appreciate the beauty of this game. Talk to people. Get your weapons stronger and your armor better. Weapons are defined by their movesets not by how late game you get them. A standard long sword can easily take you to the end of the game. Armors are more based around weight and poise. But do not worry about this too much. Just enjoy the game. Cant do something? Go somewhere else and if there is nowhere else to go it means you need to get better. This game will not hold your hand. Sometimes it will teach you how to not suck. But it pays off. You will see.

VIT is good to  or even  and anything about  END only increases your equip load stamina maxes out at   which can be good if you like heavier armours.  is a good stopping point for INT if you go that route and FTH up to  is pretty good.If you are interested in playing around with possible builds go to mugenmonkeyYou can plan things out completely and see how changes in your stats will reflect on your character.,darksouls,cq3xabd,1,t5_2sazo

Its not just the physical maps but the enemy placement that is so genius about them since they were designed together.  Changing enemy placement would make it not work correctly with the environments.Lost Izalith is just not a super good area and could stand to have a make over but none of the other areas.And changed item placement I would also disagree with since the item placement is also very well done.

3982445,0,t1_cra46kv,Not OP but even though many people prefer Super Smough for easiness I think Super Ornstein is not that bad if you are able to be patient plus you get a nifty ring and Domhnall armor set out of the fight that way. Its still a tough fight and basically certainly tougher than Super Smough but Super Ornsteins bigness can still get him and many of his attacks trapped on pillars. Super Smough has the annoying potential to chip away health even when youre blocking his various lightning attacks whereas Super Ornsteins physical attacks can all be fully blocked with a good enough shield e.g. Silver Knight Shield though it may need to be upgraded for full effectiveness and his lightning attacks can be fairly easily dodged with sidestepping or rolling. Activating and beating Super Ornstein is probably the harder way to go about the fight but I think its more fulfilling. Once you get down to  v  on Super Ornstein you dont have to split your attention and most of his attacks are fairly clearly telegraphed so I think its still quite fair even if challenging and potentially timeconsuming.,darksouls,cra8fkd,2,t5_2sazo

4139004,0,t1_crrwsbm,Well a few things some of which have already been said in other responses but Ill try to give everything. First off its biggest sin is being built up so heavily prior With Queelag her sister multiple references to Lost Izalith and Kirk constantly assaulting you. Then lets not forget the biggest plot point of two of the most well known NPCs happen here. Any way you look at it Lost Izalith has been with you basically since you rang the first bell of awakening. So you have all this build up and what do you get?Well lets start with the demon ruins. Just think about that name. Its massive! The demon ruins?! Sounds like youre going to be exploring something equivalent to fucking Anor Londo! Just this massive spiraling hellhole of demonic energy. Instead we get a hallway and essentially a mini boss rush. Okay so thats boring but what about Lost Izalith itself? Well of course the laval is a pain but not terrible. I never found it that distracting but it does immediately draw you out as your eyes are blinded by a bright orange and the most irritating sound effect plays with every step. You get to your first enemy and its a group of giant asses of much cooler enemies. THen you reach the second group of enemies a bunch of wideass lizard things? Theyre boring to look at boring to fight against and boring to even pay attention to. Finally the third and final enemy is introduced The chaos eaters. These guys have a huge pool of health compared to those around them break you armor which is awesome due to the repetition of the boss coming up and once again theyre boring as fuck to fight against. Now lets think about enemy placement. Throughout the whole first half of the game each enemy seems specifically placed to exaggerate one thing or another. Theyre given intelligent tactics and advantageous positioning. What about these three pinnacles of boring? Theyre is no rhyme or reason to their placement. They seem hazardously copypasted to simulate interesting environments. And before anyone argues that theyre placements are supposed to be chaotic I counter with my ageold argument Purposely not fun is still not fun. Then the boss The Bed of Chaos. Lets face the design looks badass. When you are in stage three and you have this withered pained women constructed out of roots while a raging firey demon erupts from her back both trying to rip your soul from your body... Thats fucking rad. What is NOT rad is instant kills damn near unblockable attacks platforming in a game without a decent jump button and basically every other part of that fight. And yet again beyod being dickpunchingly irritating it is STILL boring.Also as a side note attached to this boss next time you walk up to the foggate look over the edge of the stairs. You see that? Yeah? The complete lack of textures? The fucking GRAY BOX THAT WASNT FINISHED?!Finally the greatest sin of them all This place is gorgeous. The color pallete is probably my favorite in the whole game. The architecture is interesting and demands to be displayed. The skybox just forces me to stop and gaze up at it following every insane line into a splintering of a dozen more. This place is down right breathtaking and if youre wondering why I sound so pissed this is it. I fucking LOVE this area! Or more I love what it should have been. It SHOULD have been a sprawling city the likes of Anor Londo New Londo or the likes. It should have been massive and twisting hiding grotesque creatures gnarled up in curls of roots sprouting from their eye sockets and tearing through their abdomens. It SHOULD have been plagued by burning demonic beings howling in pain and rage. It should have been massive showing of the architecture and flowing lavafalls and really allowing that land to hint at the previous people who lived here. This place should have felt at one point as though it wasnt totally fucked and also bigger than a small neighboorhood. This place is built up to be grand could have been grand and instead was a boring as fuck hallway with pathetic enemies and a shitty boss and every time I reach this part in the game I grow sad because it should have been so much more. ,darksouls,crs2byf,19,t5_2sazo

Today decided to tackle Anor Londo enjoying the enemies and scenery and finally find the boss area for the dynamic duo Ive heard so much about. First try solo I get stomped only had  estus so ok no problem. Second time around I am more than happy to bring sunbro. I heard that once you kill one the other gets stronger so take my time whittling down their health evenly. My Zwei takes Smough and my jaw drops as the dragoon bastard goes back to full HP! Sunbro gets whiffed and I fall soon after. Alright no worries have  humanity left. Human up get sunbro in my frustration make a bunch of mistakes and use  estus on the way to the boss room. Focus dragoon first Smough gets big fucking  hits me while sunbro is running into the corner. Can anyone at least point me in the direction to get one of my weapons above ?

4246695,0,t3_39kgsl,Ive never played Bloodborne but I have heard that there isnt much weapon variety. Dark Souls has a fair amount of variety and almost every weapon in the game can be used effectively with practice.    At first some weapons may seem so similar that there is almost no point in both of them existing but they almost all have subtle differences in the moveset that can make a big difference in how you use them.    Because of this  it really pays off to try out different weapons. Try to really give them a shot before you ditch them because they usually take a while to get the hang of. You may start out thinking a weapon sucks then it might turn out to be your go to.    This is one of the biggest reasons for the replayability of the game imo because you have to relearn a lot about how to play when you change weapons.,darksouls,cs4bba6,1,t5_2sazo
4250079,0,t1_cs4kc62,I mean BKH is great early game but you can very easily out DPS it with a curved sword at  dex. PvP the falchion works well because of the high damage and high range. PvE range matters a little less so something like the painting Guardian sword is perfect.  High damage bleed and buffable.These options already out dps the BKH.  Another thing we could do is put a weapon buff on.  Falchion  dex darkmoon blade  faith at Max stamina does  damage in less than  seconds.  Theres still another  damage per hit or so you can get by hitting the  faith soft cap for talisman scaling.  The painting Guardian sword at  with  dex has higher damage per hit than falchion and inflicts BLEED.  If you get off a full stamina bar buffed against bleedable enemy the bleed is almost guaranteed to proc adding massive damage to your already ridiculous damage.  This isnt even mentioning what you can do with RTSR power within phantoms that use chanellers trident.  ,darksouls,cs4p4yh,1,t5_2sazo

4281421,0,t1_cs87df8,Neat. That doesnt explain why they didnt up the player count in an update. I get that its not just flipping a switch but they already did that part. Also other games have done similar things upgrade the graphics and  add in the dlc on PC like Metro Sleeping Dogs and Deus Ex. While their initial discounts for those that already owned it were each different none of them had the gall to charge the same as a full price brand new game even for people who didnt own the original. They hover around  for the normal version and less for those who already own the original at least at launch. And Shadow Warrior upgraded everyones graphics for free.

4302895,0,t3_3aa1op,There are no direct ties. The sequel establishes The cycle a turn of inevitable events that always leads to the linking of the flame whenever it starts to die out. The events of Dark Souls are basically the first Cycle. Gwyn links the fire just as it is dying to keep it alive. You go and slay  great beings with powerful souls to also kindle the flame the kindling of the flame ending is canon. From then on countless kingdoms have fallen and the  great souls you burned were always reincarnated Gwyns Witch of Izaliths Nitos and Seaths into  random beings that eventually grew to become another  great ones. When the curse of the undead rolls inevitably onto the land a great hero has always emerged most of them undead but not always and slain the  great ones to kindle the flame again. Each time the flame fades it is relit no flame no matter how great does not one day sputter and fade. Even from the dullest embers the flame can be relit again. The linking of the flame has become inevitable and each time it is linked souls flourish anew and the cycle begins again. The only traces of old kingdoms are the ruins they once inhabited as well as a few odd artifacts. Dark Souls  takes place in one of these cycles though so far down the line that only few people even have the faintest recollection of the original Lordrans story.,darksouls,csansye,12,t5_2sazo

4345057,0,t3_3arxbu,The best method I have found is Sprint up the buttress do not stop and they wont hit you. Once you are on the ledge run towards the right one there is a small window where the left archer can get a shot of on you if he does just roll into the wall to dodge it. Wall roll to dodge any shots the right archer fires as well. If your shield is good enough you can also block the arrows higher stability is what you are looking for here.  Once you get close enough to him where he draws his sword back up so that he is on the curved part of the ledge and you are on the straight part. You can block him until he falls off parry him and sometimes hell even fall off on his own.Edit A high stability shield helps here to prevent the blocking stagger animation you get when blocking an arrow or sword hit.  of the time this works everytime.,darksouls,csff3x5,2,t5_2sazo

4447371,0,t1_csr7kwm,First off this isnt necessarily a suggestion for Dark Souls  OR  theres no way I or anyone else is going to go into the games code and somehow add it in. I got some pretty harsh comments a while back by implying that modding is even possible in Dark Souls. Go figure. Im proposing a hypothetical mechanic to stir up some interesting conversation thats all. Im trying to take all Souls games into consideration but I frequent this board more often than Dark Souls  so thats why I posted it here.Of course I havent done a lot of research to see how this would affect balance after all I dont even use a bow that often. But I doubt it would make an appreciable difference in  of games because of how little people tend to focus on bows and even in the games where it would make a noticeable difference I doubt it would in any way unbalance the game because of how limited it is. If you use up a bunch of arrows on a boss and then die you wouldnt get those arrows back. Or if you knock some White Gargoyles off the ledges of Anor Londo with an arrow or two youre not getting those arrows back. If you kill a Crystal Golem with arrows youre not getting those arrows back. If you miss youre not getting those arrows back. Switching from one set of arrows to a new one is still going to be basically the same theres just a good chance that however many you buy will last a bit longer than they already do.,darksouls,csr9zg4,2,t5_2sazo

You really wont need it.  strength is also unnecessary because theres really not much benefit beyond the  mark.To give you some advice I kinda made a Black Iron Tarkus build basically me in his gear. The GreatshieldBlack Iron Greatshield I forgot the name has fantastic stability and also really good fire defence. I was strong enough with the Greatsword but I had that for strength scaling and so it could be buffed a  Fire Claymore and a Lightning Zweihander which I think wound up doing more damage cant remember IMO you need those other options for different enemies and all  swords are both easy to find and fantastic in general.My biggest thing though Id youre going to have to get used to playing differently. Moves are slower you walk slower you cant parry with a Greatshield you cant dodge through stuff anymore etc. For that I recommend you get the Elite Knight set as early as you can so you can get a feel of how slow youll be moving from now on.Other than that dont feel bad about wanting to use the Mask of the Father Havels ring or the Ring of Favour and Protection. Its normal to feel like youre just missing one little something to be strong enough or ready and youre not a casul for using them.

It pisses me off to no end that this guy is raking in upwards of  a month to then feed off of souls community members who do it for the love of it. It would be fine if it was all his work but the plagiarism is so blindingly obvious.Edit on second read I was probably way too harsh on Vaati. The thing I dislike about this situation is Vaati profiting off of work other people do for free because they love it. Having said that both Aegon and Vaati have been instrumental in helping develop the Souls community and its sad to see it devolve like this. Aegon is obviously pissed about not getting credit where credit is due and I also salute him calling attention to Vaati not crediting dmcredgrave as well... Had Vaati been more forthcoming with providing credit then this situation could have been difused long ago. I still think Aegon has a valid point when he poses that Vaati sees himself as separate from the Souls community and to be honest his podcast appearance was shameful. As someone so apparently well versed in Souls lore his contribution was essentially nonexistent and to even the untrained ear he was clearly back pedaling. Anyway Im not about to delete this comment and certainly welcome and further criticism from Vaati supporters  I also totally accept that I may have rushed into pitchfork mode way too fast as well. At the end of the day its just sad to see such a passionate community devolve into pointless bickering and I fully understand that replies like mine certainly dont help the situation either.,darksouls,csw09vk,-34,t5_2sazo

4502843,0,t3_3cq9un,Theres a lot of good advice here so Im just going to throw in a piece or two of my own that nobodys mentioned yet.. The most important thing that nobodys told you yet is to read the description of every item in the game that you pick up. Every single one. Weapon key consumable all of them. This is just as important as getting all the NPC dialogue IMO as its where so much of the games lore is hidden. In addition to story purposes you might find that item descriptions can give you hints on where to go next hint at a feature of the item thats not visible in the stat block illuminate a game mechanic that you didnt knowunderstand etc.. Dont be afraid to make mistakes! Its your first playthrough and youre free to fuck up as much as you want to. Thats part of the fun. You can even ignore a piece of advice given in this thread if youre feeling bold and want to see where it leads.. Dark Souls isnt some absurdly hard game that want to destroy you like the legends say. It just expects more out of the player than other games and demands that you respect it in return. If something is impossibly hard theres a good chance that youre doing something wrong. Its possible to overcome just about anything in the game through a high enough application of skill but you might be better served to take a step back and reevaluate your approach.,darksouls,csy8i04,5,t5_2sazo

4572134,0,t1_ct6qao0,Seath was alive during and before the fall of Oolacile.  And one of his golems captured Dusk sometime after the fall.  And Dusk is a sorceress and Oolacile had special sorceries and Seath of course was very very interested in sorcery...  maybe his only motive in connection with the Abyss stuff is that he wants knowledge of sorcery and for whatever reason he wants human girls.  It seems to make some sense that at some point in his deterioration he would become interested in capturing Dusk.I tend to think that he was just working for his own known desires and not trying to do anything in particular with the Abyss or the dark.  He wanted immortality he wanted scales he wanted test subjects maybe at some point he wanted a human mate or something like that.  He wanted knowledge.  We see him or at least his minions hunting for and finding girls.  And we see that he has somehow captured half of a crucial pendant from Oolacile maybe his golems sometimes gather artifacts as well as people.  But that might only be because he once thought that artifacts might help him become immortal which is very plausible since a crystal artifact did in fact end up giving him what he wanted sort of.Its possible that he had an interest in the Abyss for its own sake.  But I dont know of any evidence that he did.  Everything he does in the story as far as I know is tied in with his need to become something different from what he is.No idea where the hydra came from.  But I tend to think it wasnt put there by anybody.  Note that the crystal golems often get killed by it...  it doesnt seem to be a friend to Seath.  Also it drops a scale I think?  And Seath kind of has a thing against creatures with dragon scales....,darksouls,ct6xela,3,t5_2sazo

4622311,0,t1_ctclknh,The guy below me explained this pretty well  the entirety of the world is above Ash Lake including Izalith. It may help to clear things up if I explained that Ash Lake as we know it is actually a vast endless sea with countless Archtrees  visible from both the Tomb of the Giants and the area designated Ash Lake in game. The area we explore where you find the last dragon is only a very very tiny fraction of the world one which cant be seen from TOTG. However you can see other parts of the vast ocean and archtrees from TOTG.The underworld we see in the intro is never actually seen. If anything its likely the entrance to the Kiln  what would eventually become Firelink Altar  and is actually located above the sea of Archtrees.The reason why you dont see a ceiling either in the intro or in Ash Lake ingame is because its so tall. The Archtrees are kilometres tall the vast lakeocean is large enough to support the entire world and to have its own weather systems among other things.As a sidethought something with uxerxes pointed out excellently was that the name Ash Lake comes from the fact that the trees were all incinerated by the Witch of Izalith. If you look at the water its notably grey  filled with the ash of thousands of Archtrees. Hence Ash Lake. I never much thought about that before  good work mate!My question personally is  where the hell does the light source in Ash Lake come from? It sure as hell aint the sun. Any ideas anyone?Oh and the Kiln as far as I know exists on an entire separate plane of existence. We know for a fact that Firelink Altar geographically placed beneath Anor Londo but the player can see clouds and sky from the Kiln. So Im pretty sure that the white void the player passes through with all the Black Knights is a passage between planes of existence.,darksouls,ctd7tpt,1,t5_2sazo

Being slower and more careful will give you a chance to learn from your deaths. You will die a lot either way so make the most of each death by learning from them.Your equipment weight is important.      are the points at which your dodging will become slower. Generally anything under  is fine. If you go over you had better have a really good shield to go with it.For a knight build endurance will be very important because it lets you use decent armor without being too heavy. For stat importance Id say first get enough strdex to wield your weapon of choice then pump up endurance until it stops giving you stamina points vitality as needed then whatever stat your weapons scale best off of.,darksouls,cthfrwn,1,t5_2sazo

A quality build can get the most out of weapons that scale mediocre with both stats instead of well with one stat. It also has the widest arsenal of weapons available due to levelling up both STR and DEX.Another reason one might want to level both DEX and STR is to fulfill specific weapon requirements. Only certain weapons require decent investment in both STR and DEX like the Black Knight weapons. You actually have the exact stats needed for the Black Knight Sword. If you keep DEX at  and level up STR a bit you can weild all the Black Knight weapons which are pretty powerful. Id kill a black knight or two and hope for their drops.,darksouls,ctpx1tt,1,t5_2sazo

Im not surprised that many more people like DS in the DS subreddit but I dont agree with those points like you dont agree with mine.Really? You think Estus was a good mechanic as being the only healing item? Do I need to remind you of humanity the instantaneous full heal that can be easily farmed in the Depths one of the first areas the player can visit? Just sit there and use humanity when you need healing you even get plenty from the base game to do it.I already discussed my opinion on world design...I think DSII has better hitboxes. Each game has their own shitty hitboxes. Ive already discussed this.Heide Knights dont act ANYTHING like Black Knights thats an extremely naive thing to say. Mushroom people that kill you in one hit arent exactly my favorite enemy TBH but to each his own. Im more or less talking about Red Phantoms in NG but the invaders in DS were fucking shit compared to the invaders in DSII especially the DLC invaders like Mauldron or Holy Knight Aurheim. They all have terrible AI low HP and dont pose any real threat to the player in the areas they invade. Thats poor design going against eveything an invader does in a Souls game. And I admitted that both games gank you but Dark Souls does it considerably more now that I think about it.gt It takes high level PvP to be executed wellSL  isnt high in DSII at all its almost equivalent to the SL  meta of DS. With the addition of Adaptability and the splitting of Endurance into two stats Endurance and Vitality it had to be readjusted. SL  isnt even the common meta  is. So no idea what youre talking about there.gt killing all novelty builds and low level PvPWow you really dont know what youre talking about in terms of PvP do you? Low level PvP thrives because of the Agape Ring and is very popular in areas like the Belfries. Novelty builds are around too.gt PvP died a swift deathYup. Not even going to talk about how wrong this one is. Just look at streams today and see which Souls game they stream for PvP.All of this has already been discussed before youre not bringing anything new to the table.

4792903,0,t3_3ghtf1,Late to the party but I had to share. Mine was the very first time I got invaded. I had read about the PvP in Dark Souls and was really excited about getting into it but I knew Id have to play through a good portion of the game before Id have much of a chance. To not spoil the game my first playthrough was fairly blind only looking things up when I got stuck and didnt know where to go.So my very first character was trodding along at the first Burg bonfire... I hadnt even gotten to the merchant yet when I notice the fog walls go up. I walked over to them wondering what was happening trying to cross through. I shrugged it off when I couldnt and headed back towards the merchant to continue my exploration when I saw that dreaded message appear at the bottom of the screen Invaded by dark spirit SomeGuy or whatever.I was filled with dread and excitement at the same time. My palms started to sweat and my heart began to race. I immediately dispatched the last enemy in my immediate area and wheeled around looking for this new foe whom I knew was controlled by another player. I had no idea what to expect It was so exciting!Finally I notice a figure confidently striding my way in the distance glowing red. Having not played past the point I was currently at I paid attention to his armor to try and get some idea of what Id be facing. To my noob eyes this invader looked amazingly intimidating and I knew right then I was going to die. Oh well its part of the game I thought and I decided I would make my stand here and give it my best shot to learn everything I could from this encounter as I knew it would be only the first of many.On the platform with the two spearshield hollow soldiers with the staircase going down to the merchant I waited as my enemy approached. As he stepped onto the platform with me I was determined to make this fight last as long as possible to learn as much as I could from this red bastard I knew would soon be my murderer.Shield up locked on I circled as he bowed. Weird thing to do I thought as I gave him a quick whack with my completely unupgraded handaxe. As I rolled away I shot my eyes up to his health bar to gauge just how many hits it might take for me to win this battle I knew well would be unwinnable. Despite knowing from the beginning that hope was futile my heart sank as I watched a barely noticeable piece of my murderers health bar diminish  to call it a sliver would be an injustice.As my character recovered from the roll animation I noticed my opponent switch to a pyro flame and queue up a spell obviously angry... as if Id broken some rule of combat that I had no way of knowing being a complete noob and all. Thinking Id see a fireball I rolled toward my opponent to dodge. To my utter surprise out of his hand comes a thick purple mist. That didnt hurt at all I thought as I backed up into it to get out of range of my opponents sword. Not two seconds later did I see the poison message appear on the screen. Shit! I didnt know you could be poisoned in this game I yelled out loud as I started to panic.I used an Estus praying it would remove the poison as my murderer approached. I rolled to the side just in time to dodge only to be dismayed to still see my life draining away. I gave another whack with my axe only to whiff the air where he had been standing as he flipped  FLIPPED!  to the side. I was in awe as I watched his flaming hand pull back and light up again my character still in the recovery animation from my swing.BOOM! An explosion of flame erupted from his hand and engulfed me. Lucky me I had been holding nay jamming the LB button as soon as I saw the spell queue up and I did get my shield up in time. Horror enveloped me as despite my shield protecting me almost ths of my life was gone and still draining! I rolled away again as my murderer swung his ridiculously large sword attempting to decapitate me and immediately chugged another Estus.Screw it I can win this I thought emboldened by having survived neardeath twice so far and I rolled at my murderer thinking to go on the offensive. WHACK! SLICE! SLAM! Not my attacks but my murderers He had seen me coming from a mile away and combod me with what I would later learn is called a Zweihander.As much life as Id taken from my murderer in my initial pathetic attack I now had left sustaining me. Hes just been playing around this whole time I realized only too late. Fuck it. I pulled back my handaxe to start my own assault just as my murderer recovered from his devastating combo animation.Then I heard a sound Id never heard before a sound I didnt even know existed in the game. BONG! I was completely thrown aback! Why is my character teetering backward like an idiot I screamed as my murderer began to teach me the second new sound effect Id previously never heard WOP! SPLOTCH! I furiously pressed every button as fast as I could as I watched my murderers enormous blade separate me from my precious internal organs. I set the controller down as the alltoofamiliar YOU DIED message appeared onscreen and I laughed through my rage as I watched my opponent toss things in the air and heard IM SOOOORRRRRYYYY some  times before the loading screen came up.So yeah my first really memorable moment is burned into my memory. All in all it probably only lasted  seconds but it completely hooked me on the Souls series. I couldnt wait to try some of the things Id watched this invader do to me to get further in the game and find the awesome spells and equipment this guy had. I had never had so much fun being completely dominated in a game like that. Dark Souls completely changed the way I play video games.I dont remember his name and I dont think I ever ran into him again but I like to think hes still out there spamming red eye orbs in the Burg on his noobkiller character teaching every new player a valuable lesson This is Dark Souls son.

4990980,0,t3_3jaby1,my first tip is dont start as a sorcerer. Heres whyif you take the master key as your gift you can save Griggs of Vinheim without killing a single boss except asylum demon duh. By going through new londo valley of drakes and darkroot basin you can get to the blacksmith in the undead parish right away. Just outside the parish is the basement key dont forget to activate the elevator to firelink and you can backtrack through the undead burg to the dragon bridge and the burg bonfire. When you hit the bonfire buy the residence key from the undead merchant and go back to the bridge where the door to lower burg is. You can now save griggs and go back to firelink to buy some spells that will make the first chunk of the game a cakewalk. When you save him you can get a full set of sorcerer starting equipment hence not bothering to start as a sorcerer.equipment will never be a big problem for you nor will stats. If you do things right by saving griggs and making sure to buy Logans spells after saving him in Sens fortress youll cruise through most of the game. You wont have to worry about having much HP so dont bother leveling VIT casting doesnt use stamina so dont bother with END. Just level up INT to  as fast as you can and some attunement. Youll probably want  slots for the first half of the game  for the second.You could level dex too for the casting speed but getting INT to  is more important imo.None of this will make you aggressive exactly. Casting is sort of passive spells take time so you really have to hang back if you want to be a casting sorcerer.Your other option is to do a sorcery quality build which means leveling INT and DEX more or less in tandem depending on what you want to use weaponwise. You can get the enchanted ember pretty early and make an enchanted weapon with low str requirements. Then you can use things like homing soulmass and buffs instead of the more passive spells.,darksouls,cunlkhg,5,t5_2sazo

What if we didnt know the gender of Ciaran? Like before the Artorias DLC when the only mention we got of Ciaran was in the Hornet ring and no gender was mentioned. You would suspect that shed be a male from her name correct? However that theory would later be proven wrong. Its the same thing with Sif. Even though well probably never have an answer as to what Sif really is you cant just say claim that Sif is without a doubt a female because the name might be female in our history but it doesnt  mean Sif  is female. I see what you mean its definitely food for thought but as Ive said time and time again there is no concrete proof. There are things to speculate about though like the name origin and the fact that Sif is referred to as a male in the official Dark Souls strategy guide. gtThe fact that you think Sif has to be male because it has a female name is pretty bloody ridiculousI wasnt saying Sif has to be male just because it has a female name Im saying Ive just always thought of Sif as a male and even now that I know that its name is female it doesnt change my perception of Sif because it isnt proof of anything due to the fact that there is a female character in the game with a male name.I also wasnt taking anything out on you take it easy internet warrior.,darksouls,cv88x9o,2,t5_2sazo

5390769,0,t3_3ou57s,I guess someone has already mentioned that Hidetaka Miyazaki wasnt involved as a leading designer during Dark Souls II development so this is pretty much the answer. However while Im agreed with you that second Dark Souls is disappointing I have to admit that it disappointed not all fans. This game lacks pretty much all key element of singleplayer PvE while it has all sorts of improvements in Faction PvP. And most controversial design choices favour this aspect. Dark Souls II has vast plain spaces with interactive environment large number of PvP factions to choose from and interlocking invasion system even with forced summoning. So while loyal PvE player and PvP duellists were displeased the rest of PvP community along with many newcomers were fine with the new entry in the series. Also I must admit that Soul Memory was a pisspoor idea to begin with and Boss AI is braindead from time to time.     Well personally I hope that complex and narrow level design with intensive verticality would make it comeback in Dark Souls III.,darksouls,cw0qc55,1,t5_2sazo

In my first save however I am constantly being ganked by  sorcerers shooting homing soul spears that while easy to dodge take out half my health if I mess up.

And also youll probably need to roll to dodge the big jumping stab because most shields cant be relied on to block that.

5466493,0,t3_3pwjtr,The problem Is that it is probably hard for the weapon to live up to the expectation generated by everyone always mentioning it as really good.  The damage isnt all that high in an absolute sense its just one of the better damage options IF your dex is  and your strength is very low.  That means for PvE it loses a lot because most of the game probably isnt going to be spent at  dexterity.  The more interesting feature is the long R thrusting attack.  Thrusting attacks are good not just for counter damage but because they are often safe ways to hit your opponent.  Again for PvE I think it loses some of the value because it is easier to swap weapons for each situation AND many more weapons are viable.  For PvE a weapon with a thrusting R is going to be better for that purpose Rs have slower windup and longer recovery both of which work against the safety idea and the idea of getting true counter hits.  The halberd has a longer thrust with its R and you can combo R no problem and the damage is significantly better.  For a dex build the scythe also has a long slashing R and again will deal a lot more damage.TLDR.  The balder sword isnt obscene especially if you are considering many different contexts its more like a top tier winner in a certain niche.,darksouls,cwae9pf,3,t5_2sazo

If you are wondering if you are at the right place at the right time and you get smashed you are doing everything perfectly right. This is Dark Souls how it should be. You encounter lets say undying giant skeletons and get recked a lot you probably should come back later. You encounter unattackble ghosts that fuck you over pretty easily you are probably not prepared for them. Dont ask for clues look for them. Mostyl they are threre. Just pay a lot of attention. Dark Souls s level design and amount of attention to the details is immense. One tip that may helpDont think in a DS pattern. Go slower.

My idea is that there are two swordsmen and one dies and then chills with its friend in Asylum. And that the Halberd comes twice. The others just chill in Kiln when they get beat.  So my idea is five knights the ones you see in Kiln are the only black knights still corporeal and that they respawn at the Kiln. The more bored ones go back for more fights and then eventually they all stay to protect Gwyn.Why did I come with this ambiguous theory with no evidence?

5926693,0,t3_3wiwrb,While I understand some of your concerns with how so many important things arent explained and some of the plot elements are a bit too impenetrable I dont really judge the game too harshly for them.  The message system was put in place to help get players talking to each other inside of the game itself to figure these things out and outofgame discussions on forums such as this sub are also an important part of the game experience.  Dark Souls impenetrability is a deliberate part of what makes it a communal experience which is great.Some of your other concerns however suggest that you just havent played enough of the game yet.  There are very few weapons that are truly useless weapons inside of a given class have slight differences in scaling length and R animations that make them useful for different sorts of builds.  And you really cant judge magic when you barely used it replay the game as a sorcerer and see how different it feels and also how hilarious it is to pew pew bosses in the face for  damage with a crystal soul spear.,darksouls,cxwir4y,7,t5_2sazo

5993200,0,t3_3xhpsw,Im  convinced that Dark Souls as well as its sequel and its bloodsoaked cousin Bloodborne is a metaphor for fighting depression. You the player are cursed in Bloodborne youre suffering from some plague or disease same idea. You face becoming a Hollow a mindless zombie searching endlessly for more souls to consume. You find yourself in a hostile world with little guidance. Other people NPCs are at best a minor help but none of them can truly help you or understand what youre going through. NPCs correct me if Im wrong often dont bear the curse also bear the curse but each one continues his or her journey more or less on their own occasionally receiving help and support from you and vice versa but mostly alone. The curse for all intents and purposes is yours alone to bear. As you hollow other worlds lose contact. You become isolated in this hostile environment much like someone spiraling into deeper depression becomes emotionally isolated and distant from others. But you must persist.You continue on fighting demon after demon. The Capra Demon might kick your ass about a hundred times and youre ready to give up. But you cant. In real life you have to press on and continue fighting your demons though theyre not given explicit physical form as they are in Souls giving your all to prevent them from overcoming you. You cant become hollow. You continue to chase after your humanity and to break the curse.Each challenge feels more difficult than the last. Just as in Dark Souls life can continue to kick your ass day in day out but you cant give up or become hollow. And when you finally do overcome each challenge and as a result of persistence and determination you slowly grow stronger. You can go back to the demons which used to torment you with your newfound strength and suddenly theyre not so big and bad. Through continued suffering through persisting despite that suffering you gain strength and enlightenment.Persistence through suffering brings strength. Dont you dare let yourself go hollow.,darksouls,cy58m47,29,t5_2sazo
5994535,0,t3_3xhzvs,Heres an addition to your queriesin the introduction cinematic the Witch of Izalith and her daughters are presumably shown to be fighting against the dragons but what theyre really doing is burning down the forest of archtrees.Why would they be doing that? Dragons obviously need space to fly and land and theyre the dominant lifeforce on the planet so they have no obvious need for the trees themselves.As for the First Flame we know it had a kiln so it definitely did not come about randomly. It seemed to be engineered by someone or something rather than an accident of chaos.And yes the DS videos do show the player lighting a bonfire with a fireiron through an enemys corpse. Now this is pure speculation but I presume the enemy in DS are the Dark Lords goons or just former dark lords since the artwork shows the world to be inhabited by great dark beasts and hollows. My assumption is that the First Flame came about by burning a being with great humanity which is why there is so little left for the pigmy to grab which results in a variety of souls  sort of like a particle collider.,darksouls,cy5ex1u,1,t5_2sazo

Jumping can be inconsistent if you havent run for at least a full second before attempting it.Make sure you dont have your shield up and trying to block as you jump.  If your shield is up or if youre blocking with a twohanded weapon youll always roll.  Incidentally this is very useful when youre running and want to roll just start blocking a bit before youll need to roll.You can absolutely make this jump fairly easily at  fps.

6067365,0,t1_cyeuany,I disagree with you here. Right off the bat you can run down into the Catacombs and complete that level in its entirety. Difficult as it may be.Or you could run through the Burg and decide to go fight Havel and do Darkroot Forest instead of progressing through the Burg. Which leads you to Parish or Moonlight Butterfly or Sif if you go buy the Crest of Artorias.Or you could go down to New Londo to fight the ghosts and kill Ingward to open Valley of the Drakes which can take you to the Forest again or straight down to Blighttown.Or you can just open the shortcut and have access to Valley of the Drakes immediately.Hell if you want to count glitches you can jump over a wall in the Burg down into the Lower Undead Burg too.Dark Souls two has  divergent paths with the lord soul areas. But to access two of them you either need a ringa capeenough health and the other one requires a fragrant branch which if I remember correctly is given after Lost Sinner Or you can buy it from Melentia but Soul Memory. While the other choices are go to forest or Heides to reach Bastille or go to Huntsmans Copse to reach Iron Keep. Not exactly flowing with choices really. To get the  Million Souls to skip areas requires you to have been cooping with the Silver Serpent Ring Asceticd several bosses or being in NG and popping tons of souls. By the time you can skip Lord Souls normally youll have beaten atleast  of them already and are en route to the last one.Then when you get down to the levels a good selection of the levels end up just being like the Lower Undead Burg. Straight lines that might have a single divergent path maybe. Brightstone campsite Sinners Rise Aldias Keep Heides Tower of Flame Grave of Saints and Gryms RespitePath to Brightstone etc.,darksouls,cyex7k1,1,t5_2sazo
6067596,0,t3_3ymxhp,yes I agree. Lordran feels like an ancient believable world with its own history and very consistent geography and details. everything exists for a reason. Drangelic instead feels a very gamey world with themed levels poison area fire area water area etc one after the other. their design feels artificial and many areas and too many bosses are overall forgettable. Its a bigger world but also somehow empty.I could draw a fairly accurate map of the majority of the DS areas and their connections but I cant remember much of DS. and DS is much more intricate! this has to do also with the fast travel from the start.the visuals dont help neither Dark Souls  is way less dark and has much less soul to me. the colors the lightning the animations the textures the enemies everything looks generic and uninspired if compared to DS. theres a reason behind all these design choices they explain it very well in the Design Works book.imo artistically speaking there is no comparison at all but ds has its own pros great pvp and tons of possible builds.if you dont compare it do Dark Souls its a great game. ,darksouls,cyeyakq,2,t5_2sazo

Otherwise its just another timed combat hack and slash. And thats where ds fell short for me it felt like I was just being piped along from mob to mob and the world feels all disjointed and wonky with too many cop out narrow hallways to stich the areas together. So arriving at each area is pretty meh. When you get to a new area in ds you almost always start at a vantage point to take in the GORGEOUS VIEW and each are felt like a new grandiose world to explore. In ds The world design just felt lazy like cmon a lava castle? Thats like video game short hand for we ran out of environment ideas. The worlds feel ruined it for me even more than the slow floaty controls that leave something to be desired with lack luster impact. When you connect with an enemy in ds you know you hit it and it feels good. Where ds feels more like just clicking on enemies till they die while you wait for the real dark souls to start.,darksouls,cyfdq5d,1,t5_2sazo

6155196,0,t1_cyp9dd3,Its assured that some Dragons are in hiding and you even meet one down in Ash Lake but their numbers can only decline. As far as we know they do not reproduce. In a few cycles there would only be a handful of Dragons left if that...gtAre either of  endings goodbad?That all depends on your perspective. Your options are to sacrifice yourself to rekindle The First Flame and let the Age of Fire continue for another eon or take Gwyns soul from The First Flame and let it die ushering in the Age of Dark.In the first case the Lords would reinstate their power and control over humanity for a time and the curse of the undead would wane somewhat. Life would continue on largely as it did before... However those already afflicted would have no reprieve and suffer for that much longer until the next Age of Fire released them from their torment. Also the Lords are not necessarily benevolent rulers as you can see by the case of New Londo which fell to hedonistic pleasures Kaathes evil influence and the Abyss. Then again this is still a temporary measure and no matter what you do the Age of Dark will come.In the second case the Lords will fall completely and humanity will rise to its fullest potential. Out from under the thumb of the Lords we will build civilizations of our own and dominate the world left for us to inherit. Its true that this would also strengthen the curse of the undead and speed its progress some but the whole world wont become undead. No one is sure how the Dark Sign chooses where and when to manifest but with The First Flame as dim as it is were currently seeing the near max speed of its contamination. The true downside comes in how soon the Abyss will spread. Without the light of the Flames to keep it at bay it will creep across the world spreading its taint. Anywhere it touches will be corrupted and uninhabitable as Oolacile and New Londo before falling to the true Dark. Once all the world has been reclaimed the Age of Dark will end and a new Age of Grey will begin. It is unknown how a new Flame will spark just as we dont know how The First Flame began but the cycle has begun. It will continue repeating the same pattern until the end of time...The major differences between the endings are that you either sacrifice yourself or become the ruler of the new age of humanity and the Age of Fire lingers for a time to come or the cycle continues immediately with the Age of Fire being finished after a single encore. Its up to each of us to decide which of these endings is good or bad and why...gtSerpents called me the dark lord at the end  is it explained somewhere how it changes myself have I gained something unique by doing what Id done and how the age of dark can come to an end?You are the Dark Lord in the sense that you will be the ruler of the Age of Dark that you have just ushered in. You have demonstrated an iron will and steadfast resolve on top of incredible ability. You singlehandedly killed off the high Lords of the past age and claimed their souls for yourself. With your power you will be their to claim de facto sovereignty of the new age of humanity that you brought about. You are the Lord of the Age of Dark the Dark Lord.As I explained before the Age of Dark will be glorious for humanity but will end in the Abyss. The Abyss is hungry and spreads in the dark or when agitated. Previously the Lords were able to keep it in check and sealed it beneath New Londo but with the death of The First Flame the Abyss is unbound and will grow until it consumes the world. That is how the Age of Dark will end when there is no more light to cast a shadow all will be Grey.God I love the Lore of this game! D,darksouls,cypa4wi,3,t5_2sazo

For now as a general strategy try to stay under him this gives you breathing room and you can attack his legs freely until he leaps away again.Not sure if its possible to be good at the game being completely new to it.

6599460,0,t1_d01x36a,One can imagine a few things theoretically we dont actually know if its Kingseeker Frampt at the end of the game in the Dark Lord ending. There are around  serpents there I believe. So from there we can postulate that there are in fact even more of them. Remember they are Primordial Serpents inferring that they were there since the beginning. There is always a possibility that they were what created the fire. Or perhaps they were there before it since the beginning of the age of ancients. Either way these beings are absolutely ancient and appear to be  of the very few things that dont lose their mind and hollow through the course of the game. So from that we can assume that they are highly intelligent and both still have their own goals. We cannot be sure though that even if the paths they take are different the outcome will not be the same.The game in and of itself is cyclical in nature its easy to postulate that whether you link the fire or not is entirely irrelevant. That you will extend the age of fire a bit longer or plunge the world into dark means that there is still a discrepancy. And in this game all discrepancies are balanced. So if you plunge the world into dark eventually a new light will be kindled possibly in some sort of strange wheel of time scenario where a new first flame appears or I like to think of the inverse scenario to the main story where hollows rule the world and Though who are not undead art chosen to kindle the first bonfire of that age and equally if you link the fire there will eventually be a chosen undead who does not. So in short it seems to me that since Frampt Kaathe and the other serpents are ancient they know the way of time. They know that time is cyclical and they want to see the cycle perpetuated but cannot agree on what should be done now whether the age of fire needs a bit more time or if it should be an age of dark now. ,darksouls,d01xryx,7,t5_2sazo

There are  different types of rolls depending on your equip burden. Lighter is faster obviously and grants you more invincibility frames when dodging. Heavier gives you less invincibility frames. You need a  weapon AND a boss soul if you want a unique weapon. Parrying is way different. Practice in the Asylum to get the hang of it. ,darksouls,d026iq0,9,t5_2sazo

Removing dsfix is really just make sure your system is stable without it. If so youll reenable it. Ive been testing a lot of things with this game recently. With settings on highest and a Hires texture pack and several mods the game runs runs at about fps with vsync on. With all that on and vsync off I run at  FPS with singleline constant screen tearing on elevation change. Those were only obtainable with an in depth yet moderate over clock on my CPU from . ghz to . ghz.I run a hz p tv. R  and fxocd to . with high performance bios adjustments. gb ddr set at .I dont believe your graphics card is the bottle neck. Mine bottle neck is still my CPU. Also those FPS numbers are from anor londo. The swamps are much lower with minimums in the s.I run the witcher  on high settings in K x at a stable average of fps for comparison... I limit the framerate to  on p. I only play at K when I want to just run around the woods.Alternatively you can turn on hard mode by turning the framerate down to fps. if playing it was easy it wouldnt be dark souls.,darksouls,d09igju,1,t5_2sazo

It will tell you how many nodes youre connected to.  Im too dumb to know what a node is but apparently you can connect to up to  of them under normal conditions which allows for the most potential for peertopeer connections.  If you see that youre connected to zero nodes after  minutes of playing you know theres some networking problem somewhere along the line and you may be helped by restarting the game entirely.It will also tell play a tone and continuously display the Steam name of anyone who enters your game summon or invader along with their soul level.  It can detect if the person is a hacker and will play the MS Windows Error tone if it is a hacker and you can press F to banish them from your world.

6897244,0,t3_4a7vq8,As for Petrus I watched a lore video Vaatis perhaps? that explained it pretty well. Simply put Petrus is an assassin. The Way of White is a powerful church that is an easy analog for Christianity. When people suddenly start coming back after death which would go against just about any traditional churchs teachings the Way of White decided to make the most of it They say that this everlasting life is clearly a gift from Gwyn and so they send any undead priests to Lordran to retrieve the Rite of Kindling. If somehow they succeed then the church looks even better and if they fail so what? One more abhorrent being is gone from the churchs view. Petrus being a faithful and likely highranking member of the church who became undead was sent to Lordran ahead of any others so that if anyone from the Way of White goes on a pilgrimage to Lordran he can ensure they dont ever come back. Remember Petrus has Cracked Red Eye Orbs and Lloyds Talismans two items specifically used to kill undead tucked away in a secret area. Its possible he is reluctant to kill his fellow churchgoers he went along with Rhea and her companions until they got to a dangerous spot then abandoned them hoping they would die and he wouldnt have to carry out the deed himself. When Rhea was returned safely however he had to take matters into his own hands.,darksouls,d0y4d9p,16,t5_2sazo

7251898,0,t1_d22gbmp,Glaring examples? Probably not. But this one example is pretty bad.For reference Dark Souls  was the first Souls game I actually completed and as such I actually am most fond of it Which is a rather unpopular opinion in and of itself it seems. But that is one awful example of world design it would have been better to have a disconnected hub or better yet have the elevator go down rather than up.Its very likely that people are stuck on that one example of poor design because it is honestly one of the best examples of what not to do when designing a game world in recent memory. I legitimately liked the game and the world but this one stage transition is just... bad theres really no other way to put it. It was just poor design in an otherwise good game world and it feels rather forced. Like the devs were sitting at a table discussing it So we need to decide where the Iron Keep goes... its a big castle surrounded by lava.Where did we put the lava area in Dark Souls ?After Blight Town.Okay put it after the gutter then!But sir the lore weve written suggests... ltSNIPgtFine fine... put it after the poison area you see its like poetry... it rhymes.BRILLIANT!Okay so how do we get the player there...Elevators of course elevators everywhere!So were going to have them ride an elevator down to the keep...?Hmm okay I guess thats silly. Have them ride the elevator up from the valley to the keep!Okay I kinda rambled a bit there but the point remains... When the example is this bad you really dont need more. The rest of the world is crafted in such a way that stage transitions were organic they made sense... This one didnt and so it will be dragged out by anybody who wants to talk about poor design in a Dark Souls game. It doesnt make the game bad but it does make you seriously wonder WTF just happened. Thankfully the bonfire fast travel system makes this transition entirely forgettable until someone points it out because you see it once and then boom bonfire.,darksouls,d22hlyp,21,t5_2sazo

I recommened playing it. Its better than  if you ask me. There are obviously problems like some meh bosses and bad world design but not too glaring to me at least. The lore is solid and the NPCs are interesing. The PVP is a lot better and the mechanics are alot smoother.And with all the faults the main game have the DLC is easily far better than pretty much everything in dark souls . In terms of level design bosses weapons and lore. The only thing DS did better than the DLCs was Artorias and even then Id say a certain Knight from DKS  is almost as good if not even better.,darksouls,d29cks1,1,t5_2sazo
7314652,0,t3_4fjw72,What makes the feel for me and I mean gameplay and not lore or art direction is the attack animations. A little bit slow no cancelling out of an animation once its started and usually a recovery especially if you miss. That goes for enemies too when learning a new enemy it is beneficial to wait for openings playing safe until you can discern the enemys behavior. I say learning a new enemy because most enemies in the game are interesting to face in some way and almost all can make you die if not given respect. The fights come down to whether or not you can dodgeblockparry because if you get hit you learn a bit and you die a bit. The combat is definitely the core gameplay loop and if you can get that correct you can do other things with character RPG stuff art style lore open world fps interesting item mechanics all the stuff gamers enjoy. Morepandas item no.  is right on DS sets the bar pretty high with lots of items that are great to do combat with.The other game I have played with the get hit and die also the learn your enemies features is Monster Hunter but it has a Japanese huntercaveman aesthetic much less dangerous small enemies not open world super peasant ds limitations almost no RPG elements... Its basically just a reference because it has really good melee combat.,darksouls,d29mk5a,4,t5_2sazo

There are series of actions that act similarly to quests but its never explicit in telling you what actions matter for what or to who necessarily.The world is always very richly detailed and rewards careful observation both for bits of storytelling and worldbuilding as well as hiding good loot in hard to find places.Until now in Dark Souls  I basically never did any multiplayer other than coop and had dozens of hours of good fun in each game.But uh yeah if youre looking for a very narratively driven game the souls games are not really that.

7382141,0,t1_d2gh10e,Its hard to say whats normal everything is a balance between agility and defense. Sacrifice one to gain the other. One might say the normal build is a medium armor set that uses both shielding and rolling. Generally loading up on defense is a very safe way to go because you just had to know when to hold L to block and let go to recharge your stamina. Furthermore if you mess up the damage absorbed is pretty high so the risk isnt low per say but its not high either.Agility builds have to rely on rolling and iframes which is more risky since you need more precise timing and subsequent rolls against combostwo enemies. Furthermore messing up means you take a big chunk of damage as opposed to the former. In short agility builds have you rolling a fuck ton more taking a shit ton of damage if you mess up and relying more on Estus since you absorb less damage. ,darksouls,d2hasdd,1,t5_2sazo
7384880,0,t3_4ge5ah,For anyone wanting to play with a cheap controller mine was . xce is a must.    It will map the controller you have to a Xbox  controller fully compatible with DS.   Im on Windows   bit.  Heres how Ive done it    Went to local cheap shop and looked for a controller that met the following requirements   Cheap in my case under .  Two analog sticks with press buttons.   buttons on the right.  directional pad on the left.  Bumper and trigger on both sides.  Two or more central buttons.  Decent grip  As solid construction as possible  This is what Ive found for .      The rubber grips are a nice plus it helps.  Mine is similar to the image but the turbo and auto buttons are in a different place.     It comes with a mini CD with just the windows driver.      It has two modes of work in my case the full analog mode is switched on by pressing the mode button and have the led turn on.      I installed the driver and made sure it all was working in Windows.    To check go into the start menu and search for game controllers click on Setup USB Game controllers or similar in your language.      Something like this window should pop up         Click Properties and something like this should pop up        Check that all buttons work and the correct analog mode is on. If the axes pop into position instead of going smooth press mode button to change.     Then download xce from here      For DS you need the  bit version.    Check instructions on the page for System Requirements.  Put xce.exe into DS DATA dir in my case  CProgram Files xSteamsteamappscommonDark Souls Prepare to Die EditionDATA  Double click xce.exe to run.  First it will extract one or two dlls into the game dir and create an ini file with the future mappings. These are going to be used to intercept and remap during gameplay.    There will be a prompt to install choose Yes.    You should get this        Click next it will go online and search for setting for your game it works with Dark Souls and many other games.    You should get something like this but with just one line.        Click the line Internet DARKSOULS.exe DARK SOULS PREPARE TO DIE EDITION and then Click Finish.    The new device window should close.      On the main window at the bottom click Auto and answer Yes to the prompt. The software will try and fail to automap your controller but it will build a base for you to fixchange.    Go trough the buttons and map them correctly.   Best fastest way is to go to a button choose record from the drop down menu and then press the button in you controller.     After all is set up click Save and close the application. You only need to open it again to change a setting or map never during gameplay.    Now just open Steam Dark Souls and enjoy the game.    In the end you can brag to have beaten DS in a cheap controller.     Edit SOme woRds.  Edit  Im on Windows  dont know if it works in Win . If someone knows or can test it please reply below.,darksouls,d2hlzph,5,t5_2sazo

Humanity does refill your health but thats what estus is for. Humanity primarily makes you human when you have at least  in the counter on the top right and then go to the bonfire and choose restore humanity or however its phrased. Once you are human you can summon characters for boss fights and also be invaded by hostile npcs. I only use humanity to refill my health when im out of estus.Similarly once you are already human you can kindle the bonfire with humanity kindling essentially gives you more estus flasks which is useful for boss fights or when the game is kicking your ass which will happen constantly. I believe being human also boosts item discovery. ,darksouls,d2le74a,1,t5_2sazo

Becoming hollow is a matter of losing a purpose giving up to your primitive self it means to definitely lose any kind of selfcontrol. Now a warning for all those who are enjoying their first playthrough lots of spoiler on the main storyline and side quests. Spoiler on the main story. Seath turned hollow not just because. He gradually became more and more obsessed with knowledge experiments and his research on the secret of immortality. The obsession quickly became madness and for a being whose life revolves around research madness is damnation.spoilerSpoiler on Siegmayers quest. At the end as stated by his daughter he turned hollow too. Now again this didnt happen randomly. Siegmayer wanted adventure he wanted to prove himself by challenging the most dangerous places of Lordran from the Sens Fortress to Lost Izalith just outside the Bed of Chaos! By constantly saving him we led him to ultimately lose confidence and question his skills and abilities. Hell during our last meeting with him he even begs us to go away and to let him be the hero for once. He lost everything he was holding to after death. Eventually he turned hollow.spoilerBelow are minor spoilers and speculation on Havel and on the position that Seath occupied during the Age of FireNow turning back on Havel he probably became hollow because of the time spent locked in his tower. Imprisoned while Gwyn his old friend and ally provided material for  the experiments of a dragon? Not only that but to know that said Dragon traitor of his own species had been made Duke and had received a piece of the Soul of Gwyn himself ultimately settling into the very City of the Gods? How terrible can that be for a former dragon slayer who even uses the tooth of one of his old enemies as a weapon? Terrible enough to make him lose his sanity sure enough. EDIT Puntuation. ,darksouls,d2t3oeq,2,t5_2sazo

Eagle shield lets you just block most of his stuff the only attack he has that you dodge is his spin to win but even if you block it it just nudged you out of range for the second hit. Upgraded EShield makes a lot of bosses a joke though.Another tactic vs Sif is that hes really weak to getting Kamehamehad by a caster in nearly instantly killed.Also the fact you dont really have to fight him till after you drain the water in New Londo giving you easy access to  weapons to two shot him with.My first time playing he was moderately hard but compared to OS and first time Spidertits he was a joke.,darksouls,d37enqg,1,t5_2sazo

This is only the weapons Im actually going to use btw not gonna waste a slab on a  broken straight sword. Make sure to pick up all the slabs you can get too. Theres  in the normal game a rd if you do seigmeyers questline  blue slabs  red slab  if you trade an ascended flame to snuggly and  white slabs. Also kill the  crystal lizards in the great hollow.Farm humanity until I have around . I use humanity to heal a lot so I like to have a decent amount to start NG with because I wont reach a good farming spot until after I get the lordvessel.Stock up on arrows resins consumables homeward bones moss green grass anything like that. Its easier to get them now than worry when youve reached quelaag in NG and dont have a bone to warp back to firelink.If theres any rare items or achievements youre after get them. Its easier to farm everything when you have the lordvessel and good gear. This is things like the covetus silver ring symbol of avarice DLC stuff.Buy all spells and unique items you want crescent axe wrath of the gods velkas talisman etc. Again easier to do it now.Kill all the optional bosses. No reason not to at this point.Kill firekeepers if you want to get a  estus to start NG with. Or  if you want to keep the firelink firekeeper alive.Work out what covenant you want and join itlevel it.Kill all nonrespawning titanite demons. Theres one in catacombs  in undead parish  in anor londo  in sens house of fun. They drop probably the hardest to obtain upgrade material outside of dragon scales. You can farm the one in the chaos covenant izalith shortcut if you really want but I usually dont bother.Kill merchants for their stuff. No reason not to.Kindle all bonfires up to . Or dont. Its personal preference really. I dont bother but I do kindle some specific ones like the last anor londo one before OampS the parish one the darkroot garden one oolacile sanctuary one and a couple others.Trade with snuggly. You can only trade one of each thing to himher each playthrough so do it.Thats about it. If you want to do something like practice running a specific part of the game this is a good time to do it as well. I like to practice some parrying every now and again theres a few enemies that give me trouble so I just kill a bunch of them for practice.Then the last thing on the list is Kill Gwyn.,darksouls,d3e1n29,3,t5_2sazo

7805867,0,t1_d3tem8b,If it was a multiplier of your armors physical and fire resist it might get some use on heavy armor users but it is just a set amount added to your total defense. Also a point invested in resistance is a point not invested in vitality or endurance. Unless you already have a TON of points in vitality the extra HP you get would offset more damage than the tiny extra amount of defense. Resistance only ups physical fire and poison defense whereas extra HP protects against all types of damage.Endurance would likely also be a better use of a point as it will allow you to wear heavier armor that offers more protection in a greater variety of defense types than resistance and gives you more stamina if you are lt  points.,darksouls,d3tfwef,5,t5_2sazo

Additionally the bleed can apply very quickly and burst down fully leveled players in a surprisingly short amount of time. The key of this weapon is to find your opportunity to get in close and burst.

7851985,0,t3_4murko,First note dont use phantoms. The Four Kings is a DPS race your goal is to deal enough damage fast enough to avoid ever having two kings active at once. Every phantom you summon increases their health meaning if the players you summon arent aggressive enough theyll make the battle harder for you.Also keep in mind that their hilts deal a lot less damage than their blades. It takes a lot of hilt hits to kill you so stay close. Havels set can help a lot with this as its poise means youll never get staggered. That means you can just mash out attacks and heal when necessary without blocking or dodging making it pretty easy in NG.,darksouls,d3ymt16,1,t5_2sazo

7912708,0,t1_d44oa24,But the fights arent fair even if the gear is equal. I have an anecdote of my own from this GRD where this poor fatrolling scrub literally didnt get a hit in as I slowly backstabbed him to death through his heavy armor and  estus flasks. I assume he was a new player from the fatrolling and struggling to kill the hollows. If you truly think having to drag it out like that is kinder you are crazy.If its a new player they are going to get destroyed regardless if its its an old player on a new character then they should know better than to go through a midlevel pvp arena while human. Its that simple.As for people invading purely to twink like in the parish well if you cant handle it dont play online. If you need summons to take the bosses there are NPCs available offline and if you just want to coop then you are going to have to accept that there are people who enjoy twinking.

Although I dont know quite how hard your Chaos Pyromancies do hit if youre not summoning Solaire you can ignore the giants which might still be all you need. I personally liked Great Combustion to get Ornstein down though casting fireballs felt like it kept be far too vulnerable.

After I made my way to the Parish I learned about the BSS which sounded right up my alley I am working on a DexPyro build because it seems fun and spent again longer than what is probably average farming that up.

For the most part bosses in the first half of the game are good up to and including OampS but after that it really goes downhill with a ton of poorly designed boss fights like Four Kings and everything in Demon Ruins and Lost Izalith and the entire areas themselves for that matter and ones that are just so utterly trivial that their designs barely matter like Pinwheel and Seath. Nito is probably the best designed of the Lords but even his fight is marred for most players by the fact that it essentially forces you to either get a Divine weapon which will do shitty damage for everyone who isnt a Faith build to take out the skeletons or just put on Havels and R spam him down. Most players will probably go for the latter and never know that if you can take out the skeletons he can actually be a somewhat interesting fight.The DLC bosses are all great though so at least theres something to look forward to after OampS.,darksouls,d4lyfel,3,t5_2sazo

I recommend giants chest piece gauntlets and leggings. Notice I left out the helm thats because its poise per weight isnt that good I recommend the fathers mask so that way you just amplifying all you other items PW value for best returns generously level up endurance. but a problem with that is a lot of your combat stats goes into just making your armor viable. trust me its worth it when that armor set is worn with that specific head piece all your enemies invaders included seem to want nothing to do with you. its funny because once the run your character does this really weird animation with its hands in the air.  I think its some sort of hack or glitch in the game. A great weapon combo to go with your massive amounts of poise and armor is a Chaos Zwiehander and a Grass Crest Shield.

I started with my first character but deleted it after I couldnt find a way to go... After that I saw a video made another character and do Undead Burg. Farmed souls there. And I just got tired of it and deleted it again. My  characters are like this lol. Then I went to Gargoyles and I deleted  or more characters. Then my true journey began. That feeling when you die so much to Gargoyles and you kill em... Owww hell yea...Long story short I nearly finished DS in  whole year because of this I dropped the game constantly.

8156443,0,t1_d4wzkeg,The problem with prioritizing humans is the ratio of hollows to humans.Any area with more than  hollows and less than  humans would quickly result in those humans reaching their max nodes and then getting spammed with connection attempts.  Theyd drop a node to accept it and then the node they dropped would try to fill its node with a human and pretty soon youve got yourself a cascade failure and nobody needs any engineers running around with crowbars after that happens.So long story short yes connecting to humans is better but prioritizing them isnt as simple as it seems.  There would need to be a whole bunch more supporting logic added to prevent things from going bad and Im not ready to make that leap just yet.,darksouls,d4x3qdz,6,t5_2sazo

8178253,0,t1_d4zti7r,Totally. The DLC is extremely fun very punishing for a new player but very rewarding. The timing for Manus are nuts but I did get it.I personally am not happy simply killing a boss. I wanted the fan prefered Souls experience i.e. melee no summons. I prefer to bait a bosses attacks work it out and only when I fully understand the boss and its timings do I go for the kill. Manus and Artorias where the hardest for this. Although OampS where extremely hard to find openings.I cannot wait to start to play  tomorrow I read a lot of the initial complaints have been addressed and SOTFS is a fantastic release.

8259072,0,t3_4sjcbi,Yeah sorcery in general can really make the game pretty stale even on NG which is as far as I took my serious build it just feels broken. If you want to still have a challenge while running sorceries youre going to have to put limitations on yourself. Im in the middle of a naked no shield max SL  and max  INT for heavy great soul arrow run and its a bit more challenging but honestly not by much. The real issue is running out of casts on certain bosses forcing me to use my dagger to finish them off which made OS more tense than it should have been lol. I can imagine four kings is going to suck for this playthrough though.But yeah for PvE the massive damage and ability to stay out of range of melee attacks makes playing the game with an optimised sorcery build a joke.,darksouls,d59xwbo,1,t5_2sazo

8381281,0,t3_4ueqkh,The way I see it the shepherding of humans was instigated by the Gods and facillitated by the church. To prevent rebellion or the rise of a Dark Lord should humans realize their full potential as inheritors of the Dark Soul the Gods set themselves up as holy and omnipotent and established the church of the Way of White. The origin of humanity was obscured and humans were lead to worship the Gods and live under their rule. Defying the rule of the Gods was heresy so humans kept themselves in check.The Curse was born as a natural consequence of the Fire beginning to fade and the power of the Dark and the Dark Soul growing in strength. The strength of the Gods started to wane and humans beings of Darkness started to become immortal Undead  potential Dark Lords and a threat the living and the rule of the Gods.To push back the Dark and the Curse Gwyn burned his own soul as fuel to stengthen the Fire. The Dark waned and the Curse faded and things returned to the status quo. The traditions of hunting Undead and burning pieces of the Dark Soul were likely instituted by the church in order to suppress the Dark and the rise of the Undead and to prevent the birth of a Dark Lord.

Except for the aoe i guess might wanna just heal that. Get some pine resin or power within maybe. And smash their shit with the zwei. Literally the easiest boss if you use this method.

8460445,0,t3_4vixy9, Well I dont think the Crystal is a satisfactory replacement for immortality for Seath. Its a fragile thing and obviously changes his very being. I think if I were in his shoes I would still be looking for a more permanent less invasive solution.     Putting that aside for now however I doubt hed be so generous. The Lord Soul was a gift from Gwyn for betraying his fellow dragons. Its a powerful item and Seaths motivations show a lot of emotions that might have been lacking in his fellow dragons because they WERE immortal. They wanted for nothing while he stood to lose everything and that makes him vastly different from them in every way.     I totally understand and sympathize with Seaths position. Were I in his shoes and I knew there was a chance I could live forever and it was being denied me Id kill everyone in this room and step over the still twitching corpses to get my chance to avoid dying! Thats an emotional response... Fear! Panic! Selfishness! Desperation! These are things the other dragons probably never felt. They felt an endless nothing brought on by having no goals no challenges no time limit... The way I imagine it Seath was totally unlike them in every way. He also wouldnt have had peers and parents who could have taught him to deal with these emotions... Id guess they would have ruled over him to this day.     Thats just me.,darksouls,d5z3aeo,2,t5_2sazo

8475316,0,t3_4vpp92,Thanks for the feedback!As an actual constructed set youd be right on the whole repetitive standpoint but as this is a limited experience every draft is very different and it feels like its own beast at least so far this is partly why reach from the abyss was made. In real magic that is a bigggg nono. In an isolated draft set that plays with itself only its been completely fine.Gwyns cards finale wasnt intended as a finale as much as it was just another utility.

8478455,0,t3_4vpp92,I think your hollowcounters threshold stuff would benefit from some simplification. Rather than a variety of things caring about different numbers consider just making one amount be the trigger point. As well you might consider an ability word to unify these abilities.For instanceHuman  If you have  or less hollow counters do a thing.Hollowed  If you have  or more hollow counters do a thing.Reach from the Abyss doesnt actually work as written  It will just immediately exile instants or sorceries before they resolve. I think it needs a if it would enter the graveyard exile it facedown instead clause.As well is it intentional that it allows you to cast your opponents exiled cards? I kind of assume it is because you can pay mana as any colour. I also agree with others that using exile as a second graveyard and exiled facedown as the real exile is a pretty big break from MtG.Also a lot of your commons are overcomplicated. Make some commons that are vanilla no rules text and some more commons that only have one ability.Darksign bonfire and scale seem to be on pretty random cards especially once youre dealing with noncreatures.Mimic Chest needs a May before sacrifice a creature I think. Unless its your intent that if you dont have another creature when you flash it in it sacrifices itself.,darksouls,d61clao,1,t5_2sazo

8487012,0,t3_4vvqe7,Firstly make sure you have a weapon that has  properties  a long straight attack and  an overhead swing. This makes it easy to position yourself to attack things while on the many narrow ledges and the overhead will come in handy when fighting the flying things. My two favorites are the Zweihander R or Backstep gt R and the Halberd R for easy ranged pokes and Backstep gt R for overhead.Im pretty sure the torches youll see lit around the scaffolding and platforms almost always mark a ladder so you can easily spot where you go down next. There are a lot of ladders that descend to a platform a body length or two below I find its better to memorize where these are and just drop down. Its faster and can help you avoid being hit. It can also let you get some drop attacks for instakills on many enemies.When you find the Shadow armor set put it on. It grants massive resistance to poisontoxin buildup! This can let you take  extra dart before you gain the Toxic effect like a much stronger longerlasting poison which can be critical to killing those blowdart guys. If its easier for you kill the dart guys with ranged attacks. I prefer to just roll through their darts or zigzag on the approach and oneshot them in melee. But once you kill them they dont respawn and it will make your life much much easier.When you get to the bottom youre going to be poisoned. Theres nothing you can do about it really even if you have Rusted Iron Ring and Poisonbite Ring and the full Shadow set youre probably still going to get poisoned in the water. Just heal through it when your hp gets low but dont bother trying to stay at full hp.As soon as you get to the bottom with your back to the wall you just descended turn right and run along the wall. Theres another bonfire very close by. Its not a bad idea to Kindle this one as Quelaags lair is very close.Continue along the wall past this bonfire and youll come across some big turning wheels with platforms on them. This is the backdoor to Blighttown. It leads to the Valley of Drakes and a door that leads up to New Londo Ruins just steps away from the ladder that goes back up to Firelink Shrine. If youre still having a really tough time going in the front door from Depths try going in this way. There are  of the big dudes with clubs but after that there are just  or  of the flying guys and one crab thing as you descend the wheels then you can go left and get that second bonfire. Its much quicker but there are still lots of goodies along the way down from the front door. Decisions!And finally just make sure you swear plenty and say terrible things about the blowdart guys mothers.,darksouls,d62f8gy,1,t5_2sazo

The distinction made by the Drake Sword Drakes areseen as undeveloped imitators of the dragons doesnt mean that the Everlasting Dragons and the Drakes are directly not related at all.It is entirely possible that the Drakes are lesser descendants or simply a far branch of their species. Furthermore not only the Gaping Dragon is a descendant of the Ancient Dragons but we know theres more descendants in the other games so its very plausible that there are such things as childs of an Ancient Dragon.That said yes Kalameet doesnt look similar to the Ancient Dragons at all. He doesnt have four wings just one eye the calamity power... And on a related note his tail cut provides the Obsidian greatsword which being made of Obsidian gives Kalameet a special tone and relates him to the Ancient Dragons beings based of mineral.In my opinion its still quite possible that. Kalameet is a descendant of the Ancient Dragons and belongs to a species between Dragons and Drakes. Or. Kalameet is just a surviving Ancient Dragon based on Obsidian which basically makes him different  or another type of Ancient Dragon.,darksouls,d6j3vaj,2,t5_2sazo

A better solution would be to shave your head and wear body armor and shortspants that breathe. The other guy who has the same inuniverse medical condition that requires his skin be exposed to sunlight as much as possible dresses like this which works well as camouflage in the forest environment you meet him in. Quiet on the other hand sticks out like a sore thumb. Also one BDSM hazmat glove doesnt make you immune to... whatever justification they used to give her one glove.

Its an animation company and they have different ways to work with them. But it costs money but it requires you not to be an animator andor artist. If you an artist that will help greatly for sure.

Enemies will follow and you can bop em on the head as they come after you.  Dont stop moving on long walkways. Walk shield up toward the end and back up to the nearest sheltered spot if you see an enemy. Dont stop out in the open. When you reach the next sheltered spot always stop to listen.

You can see how big is Gwyns honorific tomb in Anor Londo how tall he is in the intro cutscene and his statue.

Id like to point out that the gwynever we see is an illusion. Most likely she is the same size as Gwyn. I can not explain  why pracila has inate occult. I do see a very high reasoning behind below as the leader or the occult rebellions. If pracila had innate occult they would have recruted her as soon as possible. If gwynevere was rapped to make the child I do not believe she would have been motherly possible even forsaking the child. In which velka could take her in. And if taken in that young should would have grown up around the occult and possibly the occult in her is a product of her upbringing not her birth. If they did recruit her then it also gives plenty of explanation why she is in the painted world as this is the prison for any remnants of the occult rebellions. Occult can also be thought of as hate for the gods. If her own god mother has abbandon her her god grandfather kills or orders her adoptive mother killed then slaughters those whom she has grown up with only to imprison her for all eternity. You can see a very good reasoning for her hatred of the gods. And you can understand this hate for the gods being even greater then velkas.,darksouls,d7ibvcl,1,t5_2sazo

I figured out the paths were there because right at the first butterfly theres an item across a seemingly impassable gap. I sat in front of that stupid thing for like half an hour trying to find a way down or around to it. Clearly I couldnt make the jump. I actually remember putting the controller down at several points and going No way they want me to walk across. Theres no way I can do that.But there was nothing else I could do and there were these suspicious sparklies in the air that were looking less and less like careless graphics. So I took the leap of faith and walked right across. After that I realized what was up in this cave.

Everything else shards large shards and chunks are not too hard to grind for or can be bought eventually.

That said despite it being a decent game it fell so far short of the expectations set by Dragon Age Origins that people have or at least had trouble separating the game that was delivered from the game they were expecting.

Since you clearly lack the brainpower to understand let me break it down into baby steps for you.Titanite is not found outside of LORDRAN. What do ya find in Dark Souls  to reinforce your weapons? Definitely not dung pies!Also Ive heard that apparently the four main bosses are apparently the Lords Nito and friends reincarnated. I think it makes a tiny bit of sense since Lost Sinner tried to light the First Flame and the Witch of Izalith tried to create a second one. Could be a coincidence but all the same.One way or another theres just too much content in the game that either reflects directly references or expands upon Dark Souls  for it to not really require experience from the first game. I dunno about you but I wouldnt know who the mysterious Lord of light was if I hadnt played the first not would I know the significance of the Throne of Want which resembles the Kiln a bit too much.You can argue away all you want and shake your head but the fact of the matter is that Dark Souls  does expand on the first in a lot of ways just not the way one would expect it to.,darksouls,d8l44oq,0,t5_2sazo

Turned out I was able to get through the whole game using it and just beefing it up to  along the way. Leveling STR and DEX together makes that sword a beast even if its C scaling in both. I was  shotting regular mobs even towards the end of the game.what sucks is definitely the range. any shorter sword or dagger user knows the pain.

9717701,0,t3_5e0ii7,I know it is an edgy type of commentchange but if I could remake Dark Souls altogether I would make it a pc game with pc controls. It would play similar to Chivalry Mount amp Blade or Jedi KnightJedi Academy. Autoaim wouldnt exist anymore spells would be aimed with a crosshair items and spells would lay out in different keys also diagonal rolling more complexity to jumps etc.When first playing Dark Souls in pc ages ago I thought the controls and camera were shitty because it was a bad port but soon I realized it was a structural problem that console joysticks require games to condense several different actions in a few buttons lock cameras in bizarre angles with wall collision and simplify itemspell selection in inefficient wheels. The movement and attack mechanics are simply ridiculous it is as if we are playing a Tekken or Soul Calibur game slow clunky centralized camera aim and long attack animations for small player input f. ex. backstab. Meanwhile if we look at at a game like Chivalry we can see how more rich blocking parrying and stoking could be. Dark Souls could even implement local body damage in characters losing a leg or arm decapitation.Resistance as a stat would either be scrapped altogether or be used for pyromancy flame magic adjust. Either way Dark Souls magic system seems more an after thought than a core feature and needs improvement. Hidden Body would be stackable with other buffs such as Power Within. Unify all  magic schools maybe. Attunement would give the DexteryCasting speed buff instead.As for content rather than mechanics I would make starting areas in terms of atmosphere and aesthetics as interesting as late areas ie. Demons Ruins were for me. When you walk in New Londo Ruins and you see all those mad hollows praying or when you meet Rickert behind jailbars or when you talk to weak and frail Quelaags Sister that is perfect atmosphere and until Sens Fortress the game seems to lack it.

This would allow him to invade you but be far beyond your abilities to defeat. As you may or may not have noticed by now there are factions you can join in the game called covenants. One of these covenants is the Gravelord Servant covenant. This covenant allows you to infect other players worlds with additional enemies. Once infected you are able to find a black sign that will allow you to invade and kill the Gravelord Servant who is infecting your world thus removing the infection. This Gravelord infected your world and was killed by another player causing the infection to be removed and the message to pop up.Shitty Timeline . Player invades and kills you.

Upgrade your favourite shield too if you have souls to spare.The only stats that matter for a melee character are VIT END and whichever of STRDEX your weapon scales with perhaps both. Put some points into those after you sort out the whole upgrading thing.Speaking of which figure out which stats your weapon scales on  its in the stats menu and is represented by a letter grade from worst to best E D C B A S.Your move and roll speed is tied to your equip load. Try taking off armor to find a weight balance that works for you.Learn to parry.

9788328,0,t1_dajjdpb,gtBut in practice Ive found that at least on my personal version of the game holding down two directional keys and trying to dodge will only work about a  in  button presses. There is no excuse for this other than the terrible PC port and if your version of Dark Souls doesnt do this then I envy you.... thats your keyboard ghosting inputs. that is completely unrelated to dark souls and has never happened to me in any of the three games.get nohboard have it visible when playing the game and see what keys light up when you try to roll diagonally. I bet you the spacebar wont light up because youre holding down three keys already and its being ghosted.the solution is to just get a keyboard that supports more simultaneous inputs.gtbut the skill ceiling of the player will be crippled by the binary nature of keyboard movement and the lack of mouse optimization.literally never been an issue for me.  directions is enough and in DS and DS everyones limited to compass direction rolling when locked on so thats not an issue either. DS just adds the diagonals.  a five button mouse and apparently a keyboard that supports more than  inputs at once makes kbm play just as good as controller play.

I had been rolling around in light armor up til then and he kept one shotting me when I messed up a dodge. So I got fed up and put on Havels and just ate hits chugged estus and got him in one try with that new set up. It worked so well that I just played the rest of the game like that and rarely died to any of the remaining bosses.I made it a point to play NG differently partly because the tanking wasnt very skillful or satisfying and because in later NG areas the additional enemy damage made dodging more useful than tanking. I ended up enjoying that second playthrough much more because I actually had to learn some boss fights that I breezed through previously and figured how to parry enemies consistently.

10141446,0,t1_dbtawof,At least in Dark Souls  you are made aware that there are two Crystal Sages even before you meet the first  the game is very upfront about there being another Sage in Lothric Castle it is the only time it repeats a proper boss as a miniboss and even then it is used in a way that feels and behaves very differently from the boss fight. They repeat the enemy once in a completely different environment and it results in an unique challenge. There is the Ancient Wyvern fiasco though cant justify that.In Dark Souls  they just copypasted a bunch of Taurus Demons and Capra Demons all over the place. And you meet the Bell Gargoyles again as common enemies too. And the Moonlight Butterfly. And Pinwheel. And theres the whole Asylum Demon fiasco. And in most of these cases there is nothing particularly unique in the lore about the repetitions or the original bosses. Taurus Capra Gargoyles and the Butterfly are just average members of their species that just happened to be located somewhere else. I understand the cleverness you mentioned about the Demon Ruins placements and I admit I never thought about it that way before but personally I think that A the execution of such placements is poorly handled just look at that cluster of Taurus Demons and tell me it doesnt look obviously rushed and B the game repeats former bosses too many times. I dont see it as particularly different from Dark Souls  to be honest.Agreed with your second paragraph though.

10159903,0,t1_dbvms4l,Iaito is really close to the first bonfire at Blighttown you just need to take a leap of faith to get it.At first I too hated Blighttown. What I actually hated the most was all the hustle required to get to that first bonfire. Now after all the time I have spent there I can say that I am at the point of enjoying my visits. Yeah its not a pretty are but its so deep lore wise and really well designed if you think about it. The best tips I can probably give you about the area is a bloomin purple moss and b take your time. Walk slowly observe the environment theres literally no one chasing you and you are certainly not on a timer. If you try to rush the area and since you are unfamiliar with it you are probably going to have a miserable time there.Getting back on topic tho the Iaito Uchi Great Scythe Balder Side Sword are the best dex that you can have access to at this point in your gameyou can try farming the Balder Knights in the Undead Church for their sword since you cant purchase it anywhere.

Im well aware that heavy weapons in general arent as good as fast weapons and magic is easy to dodge. This lends itself to the whole discussion topic of investment vs reward and meaningful build choices and things like why playing as a pure mage is ridiculously overtuned for PvE and really bad for PvP. They did fix the systems better in the later games although magic is pretty neutered but thats different story altogether.,darksouls,dbx06oz,1,t5_2sazo

Then i get there actually and i equipped the artorias ring and roll forward into the abyss only to barely land on one of the lips of the bottom staircase and die lmao. then i lost all those souls about k from sif getting shanked by fuckin ghosts on my way back down. but then i finally got to the boss and just realized how terribly terribly wrong my weapon choice was for this fight... i was using a  lightning zwei with only enough stamina for  swings. i had soooo much trouble on the third king i had it at one more r swing of hp when i just started to moms spaghetti all over  and missed like two siwngs!!!! by this time there were two and they managed to get a little distance which makes their swords do more damage and i got bopped in the face mid estus sip.. killing me ... ugh i did thos like ten times before i finally clutched it out and then i went to anor after some well deserved parish invasions with my neewly aquired red eye but thats a whole other story with many mistakes and soulshumanity lost that i probably shouldnt go into detail about ... anyway fuck  k they are a fat bitch with no friends. praise the sun!,darksouls,dcw0xzu,1,t5_2sazo

10483132,0,t1_dcwc9d4,Theres a very useful glitch useful to me that is that lets you leave the Asylum with the demon still alive.  First you deplete the Asylum Demons HP yep on the first encounter. But before his death animation ends you quit the game and reload. The Boss will survive but when you talk to Oscar he will still give you the Big Pilgrims key even if the boss is still alive and well. Then you open the big door like normal.    Actually I will still defeat the Demon but only when returning to the Asylum later using well.. yet another glitch.,darksouls,dcwddno,4,t5_2sazo

10536459,0,t1_dd220vi,Short story  Dude made a funny video about a joke build in Dark Souls and the internet loved it.Long ass fucking story  In Dark Souls the Dark Wood Grain Ring gives you the ability to ninja flip as long as youre below  equip load.  This made your roll longer and have more iframes.  In the original release however it was below .  This was a fucking nightmare albeit kind of hilarious.  This lead to a lot of minmax builds where people would run full Havels gear remember the really bulky rock armour guy Woolie fought in the DS LP? and flip around like maniacs.  It was super stupid to deal with.  When this was patched out everybody thought these kinds of builds were dead.  In response to the patch a Youtuber named OnlyAfro made a heavily edited montage parodyesque comedy video about a joke build hed dubbed the Giant Dad which through an absurd level of minmaxing could fast roll with the most physically defensive armour in the game the Giants set a Grass Crest Shield a stamina regen shield and a Chaos infused Zweihander nicknamed the bass cannon.  Basically the entire build is centred around being so poise tanky and bulky that your Ultra Greatsword swings cant be interrupted so you can stunlock basically anybody to death.  Its far from unbeatable but it requires very little effort to be successful with it because most players dont have a clue how to deal with it.It also looks goofy as shit which helped it become the meme it is today.,darksouls,dd2f9zh,11,t5_2sazo

Also worth noting is that Gwyndolins theme is the same as the moonlight butterflys theme confirmed Seath experiment.

10562610,0,t1_dd5a9z8,Oh its the place where i have died most in any Dark Souls starting areas. Yet I love it.Remember New Londo or even Unead Burg? No ambushes there right? See we forgot that a main plot element makes you return to the actual first level of the game. So one of the hardest and the first level are actually the same in two ways. Not to mention how you can contrast the past and present to see what created most of the ruin and closed the areas.And Bastille? Its one of the best.Firstly you can get there from either Pursuer or Flexile Sentry.You can skip the sentinels if you dont intend to either spend a Branch or just fighting the first boss but thatll close off Belfry Luna which despite having an awful gargoyles rehash is a covenant location and so enforces PvPCoOp like FoFG does.While the Rupturing Hollows can be a pain they have around  HP. You should be able to oneshot them in  the situations encouraging carrying a method of ranged combat even Throwing Knives.The other enemies are Dogs that unless you rushed there are on pairs those JailersMummies... That do nothing really. There is to note the Pursuer encounters three! Also the Suspicious Shadow and some other single enemies thatll show up later and be recurrent in the game. They are deeply tied to the areas subject but thats not the theme now.Anyway it continues on with some side areas with some encounters BARRELS! lt and lootaplenty that encourage looking for every nook and cranny like the Golden Wing Shield found it last playthrough.After reviving Straid one of the best NPCs feeble cursed one! gtD you go to sinners rise. Not much to be said but Drangleic Castle will have a similar enemy set and encounter so to remember. The Boss!If you did pick up the prison key requiring beating The Sentinels you can remove the extra challenge that is the darkness in the arena. If you didnt youll either have to sacrifice the offhand for a Torch or go directly. The fight is pretty cool as its basically dirty Artorias and in the dark youll likely spend time unlocked as the lockon range is reduced. Not that hard overall but hits like a truck and will kick your butt if you are a noob without a good shield like Drangleics which youd have to kill Pursuer for  . NG makes it one of the hardest in the game though DSadism youll die once and not more! Every Souls has this in a way or another. Crowd control is a new factor to have in account so youll likely employ your secondary weapons like a ranged one to split them up magic or different weapon classes. When I use thrusting swords I NEED a Whip a Broadsword or different moves becouse out of v it will underperform and thats fine IMO.,darksouls,dd5e3fe,2,t5_2sazo

10624400,0,t1_ddbp0rr,gtI dont personally see her as one of the cheap bosses. She is in many ways like Darkluker by the fact that whilst youre dealing with either  skeletons or Velstadt shell continuously cast spells at you. Nothing which really overlaps but still remains a great challenge.gtFor how barebones you make her moveset out to be she has a pretty varied one. She has about  different melee movesets  spell casts teleporting and the ability to summon minions which is a long cast.You know I agree she has a varied moveset I was meaning more it doesnt feel varied if that makes sense. I didnt find her to be too great a challenge nd try so I probably didnt see everything she had to offer.gtI saw the same gif which has been linked for well over  years now but whenever I fight Pursuer I legitimately dont encounter such shitty hit boxes. Ive been telegrabbed with the hippos on occasions but Pursuer has never stabbed me in such a fashion and Ive played the game for well over  hours.Thats fair if youve never experienced it. Watching one of my friends play he had  tries against the pursuer and it only happened once and he didnt notice it. It happened four times to me though in quick succession. And yeah I think thats the only gif of it because everybody has seen it. No need to make yet another.gtYeah I agree. I think the concept is novel but really badly executed. Just a horribly bland boss with a somewhat cool looking boss room.This is how I feel about a lot of the unique things DS did. They wanted to innovate but they failed on the execution.gtAgain agree with Dukes Dear Freja. I wasnt trying to argue they were good bosses but the addition of smaller spiders somewhat makes sense in context of what youre fighting. The spiders also dont attack if youre wielding a torch effectively making them useless but also showcasing how lackluster Freja is on her own.Does it make sense contextually? Ive always known spiders to be solitary creatures. gtThis one I quite like fighting. I dont personally find their moveset too lackluster with their spin to win  arcing swings and animelike jump attacks.Fair to like it of course I just dont feel like fighting three incredibly highly tuned enemies all at once is very fair for the player early on. It certainly feels cheap your first time around.gtI dont see big guy as a legit criticism personally. His moveset is fairly decent and one of the harder bosses in the main game. I hate the run to both Smelter Demons however. The constant damage in his nd phase is quite minor especially if youre equipping for the fight ie. using proper rings to mitigate fire damage taken. What you say is still true but I find the damage much more negligible than what most make it out to be.Yeah the big guy point was kinda weak. What I meant was more he looked like a slightly scarier normal mob. Moveset again might actually be varied it just doesnt feel that way. I will say its interesting you dont see the damage as very much it felt like a negative old radiant life gem last I played against him.gtNow thats just wrong. That only applies if youre ever hit by Sinhs fire attacks. All of which are extremely avoidable too. Durability is garbage against her although its a known mechanic of hers. Not necessarily good but I always come with a lot of repair powder for the fight.Id honestly expect more criticism towards her constantly flying. That shit is tedious and I honestly feel like they fucked up her AI at one point. She shouldnt be able to fly that much.Oops apologies. Misspoke there but all of the fire attacks  if the wiki is right is still quite a few.  The durability is really really bad for someone who only uses polearms. Im not sure where the disparity comes in but even using what repair powder I had my weapon broke many times. Flying is horrible for sure but again Im just speaking from my perspective and dealing with the near constant gear break caught most of my attention.gtIts initially invisible until you have progressed halfway through Eleum Loyce though. Youre warned on many occasions to not go through the fog gate by Alsanna. Aava I wouldnt go as far as to say extremely fast. She was one of few DLC bosses I even killed in my first attempt. She does hit hard but her attacks are all quite telegraphed.I do partially agree with durability. I dont see many people mention it but Aava does eat a ton of durability for whatever reason. Definitely not    weapons like Sinh but I was surprised that I had to use repair powder for that fight.Truth be told I didnt know that. Ive got  hours on one playthrough and about  on another without looking anything up. Maybe not extremely but shes certainly quick. And when youve got the weather effects and her being invisible she seems a lot faster it also makes it so her telegraphed attacks arent nearly as easy  to track.I get flak literally everytime I speak poorly of any aspect of DS check this thread for example so I understand fully what you mean.

11024782,0,t1_dehkbrs,Oh absolutely. Even if Hawkshaw were completely mistaken theyre providing a service to the community in showing that the lore can be analyzed with the same techniques as used for realworld history.A lot of people still mistakenly believe ENBs speculative thousandyear timeline is canon. Further since popular fantasy tends to say absurd numbers like the demon king was sealed ten thousand years ago the timelines for Souls are tremendously expanded. On the contrary if you really try you can squeeze Oolacile and New Londo into the span of a few decades.There are actually a few concepts which I thought were common knowledge but I recently noticed are not. Ive actually started to work on some lore videos of my own in order to fill the gaps and introduce some conclusions of my own. The narrations not hard but I absolutely hate the tedium of collecting footage. For an example heres the mistake that annoyed me enough to make lore videos in the first place  Pthumeru in Bloodborne.

11028433,0,t1_dehzp1a,Like you said the game is six years old. This sub receives no new content to discuss and as a result its stagnating. If we had a single collective sub instead of individualized subs there would be more activity and more content to discuss. There would actually be new content to discuss once the final DLC drops. With more activity and a larger community we would get more content from the community to keep the place alive. The Dark Souls subs are the only ones that I know of that are dedicated to individual games rather than a game series as a whole. Even other franchises with nonlinear games that stand on their own Legend of Zelda Pokemon and again Fire Emblem have subs for the franchise rather than for specific games. And theyre all doing better than the DS sub. I really think that were handicapping ourselves by limiting the sub to a single game and not the series as a whole.

11056718,0,t1_del8p1w,I can understand and its something I honestly cant help. Basically tldr is that its a super cheap capture card for an Xbox from about  years ago and try as I might Ive been completely unable to fix the aspect ratio. It also only records in a whopping p which is amazing by todays standards.

11058763,0,t1_delgz5k,Ah. Well its really not that big of a deal. Just pick your favorite weapon and max it. You probably already know this but there are  guaranteed slabs per playthrough. The first and easiest is from Stray Demon the second easiest is in a chest near Kalameets waterfall and the third and hardest is from Siegmeyers questline. Its not worth your time to get Siegmeyers. All you want really is the easy one from Stray Demon. Grab that one and upgrade your favorite weapon to max. When you enter NG you can immediately kill Stray Demon again to get another so you will at least have  weps maxed if you really cant decide what weapon to use.,darksouls,delhqy9,3,t5_2sazo

11205180,0,t1_df1tkby,While resins can make certain fights a whole butt ton easier its very possible to beat everything without using any resins ever. In fact the bosses that I mostly use resins on nowadays are some of the easier bosses in the game just because it makes the fights that much quicker. Some of the harder bosses in the game I just beat with unbuffed weapons and always have it might help that the weapon I used for my first playthrough literally couldnt be buffed....If the guide mentions it its just because the boss is likely weak to it. They might have said you need a lot because they expected you to die a lot. In reality if you dont die you only really need  resin per boss fight if you must use them. My strategy when playing through a souls game for the first time is to not use any resins until Im confident that I know the boss moveset and wont needlessly waste them by going in blind or almost blind. At that point the only reason the resin is useful is because it makes the fight shorter so you dont have to worry about messing up as much. Longer fight means youll likely go through more estus and risk running out while a shorter fight means that you have fewer chances to die.,darksouls,df23cug,2,t5_2sazo

Lords of the Fallen was AWEFUL I dont know how I managed to complete it as fast as I did. I would absolutely love a remaster of Demons Souls... with a DLC and everything. That would be amazing. I am currently obsessing over NiOh as it has the similar gameplay and difficulty as Souls the story is just prominent not mysterious like Souls. So far it has kept me satiated until the release of The Ringed City releases. Someone had mentioned Furi which I loved but damn talk about rage quitting.

You should be at the stairs by now. Flash sweat helps. Or put on the robes you found. Sprint down the valley to the big open area.To get the ohko you need him to pull out his other arm. Its easiest done by running back to where he stood originally. Run around waiting for him to try slamming you and roll hard and far to your left when he does. Hitting his arm will damage him so you can kill him like that. You can see when he pull out his new arm as he heaves a bit and pull out a new tentacle over his head with a spray of lava. When he does run back to the fog door and he will try to leap at you. He has actually jumped off the cliff in a last ditch effort and no longer have any footing.

Being the forgotten First Hunter while later Church Hunters such as Ludwig were celebrated by Yarnham is just the start. He is haunted by his atrocities that he committed during his time at Byrgenwerth as the Doll comments after you have defeated the Orphan that for once he is sleeping calmly. The women he loves Maria kills herself in shame of her identical actions at the Fishing Hamlet driving him into so much despair that he gives himself to the Moon Presence in order to bring her back to life. Instead of Maria he is given a  pale imitation of her in the form of the doll and trapped for potentially eternity with her. Sorry for the soliloquy guys to me he has so much depth with each layer steeped in tragedy which is why he is also my favourite character and bossfight.  ,darksouls,df80tru,61,t5_2sazo

Im not typically one to write a game off over small imperfections but this is literally something that I have to see for the entire duration of the game. While I agree that this might have been an artistic choice it doesnt mean that it was a good one. It was obviously changed for a reason as every other game in the series has a significantly different aesthetic approach than DS  there has to be a reasoning behind that and as I stated previously I am not the only person who feels this way. Perhaps the developers thought that it would give the game a gritty feeling and werent intentionally being lazy entirely possible but I still dislike it all the same. When I look at the beautiful HUD designs of DeS or DSII or even the simplistic but serviceable HUD of DSIII this just feels like amateur hour. ,darksouls,df94zxx,0,t5_2sazo

I probably tried that fight over  times before I eventually got it. Nito isnt terrible most of the time you can make him kill his own skeletons so the only real problem in that fight is the toxic ground attack he sometimes opens with because Im shit at dodging it. Butterfly is easy to dodge it just took ages. Didnt do the DLC. I did Artorias once with a broken straight sword and I couldnt stand the thought of doing it with even less damage. Im sure I could do it but Im not fond of the idea. Also I tumblebuffed with GMW for some bosses like  kings and OampS. ,darksouls,dgavncr,1,t5_2sazo

One tip is if he roars roll backwards a few times if you need to heal. Hell do his full combo hitting air and you can recharge fully. If he throws his arm up the dodge is always one or two beats later than you think. Roll to the right on everything. Get one two handed hit in after a well dodged jump attack or whenever you get a clean dodge and his hand is on the ground for a beat. Side dodge the quick dark magic blast run away from the dark rain and hug him during the inward closing circle.Best of luck.,darksouls,dgjqaq5,1,t5_2sazo

11705375,0,t3_66yr5s,There are good reasons for its infamous reputation but few of them have to do with its actual design. Its a fantastic area  challenging in a way that rewards exactly the kind of play that Dark Souls should reward nailbitingly tense and atmospheric and showcasing some of the most twisted level design the series has ever seen. The only minor gripe I personally have is really that the blowdart guys could have always dropped the Blooming Purple Moss. I think it feels a bit lame to leave it up to RNG personally. If they made it a guaranteed drop they could even take it a step further and make them respawn further increasing the challenge of the area while making it arguably more fair than before for new players since you now have a source of antitoxic right there.,darksouls,dgmtrhs,2,t5_2sazo

11778129,0,t3_67tbi4,gtBut there had to have been time between the First Flame bursting into life and the Lords finding their Souls  enough people to die for Nito to begin existing for one.Hmm... why do you think that?    with fire came disparity. Heat and cold life and death and of course light and dark.Do you think it took time for disparity between heat and cold to occur?  Or between light and dark?  If not why should it take time for the disparity between life and death to manifest?  Is there any reason a bunch of people couldnt bite it the moment the First Flame came into being?  With fire came disparity.  With not after.  As soon as the first flame showed up it made things different not just from what they were previously but at all.  It seems reasonable to assume that people were suddenly distinct different where previously they had all been the same.  And its not too great a leap to assume that these differences varied in kind and degree ie some of them were  better at certain things than others.  A few of them were WAAAAAAY better.  These few had the souls of Lords.Thats how it reads to me anyway.  Not saying youre wrong but I think theres more evidence of a sudden apotheosis as there is for a gradual ascension to godhood.  ,darksouls,dgv36wk,1,t5_2sazo

He was still sitting there locked up. I guess he was supposed to break himself out and the game just glitched on me.Thank you very much! ,darksouls,dgwpz4j,9,t5_2sazo

11810303,0,t3_68hd1e,Undead Parish on the first time through the game.Im not kidding on my first time through the game Undead Parish repeatedly destroyed me and the progress I made each time was minuscule. Youve got the rats who can quickly inflict poison which you havent really seen before this point and ones hidden around the corner knight dudes who are really strong at the low level that you are at and youve also got the giant boar accompanied by its own personal army including crossbowmen. At the top of a tower youve got a black knight who will probably destroy you on your first second and third attempts. Later youve got the knight and a dude with a spear in a tight corridor so if you dont check behind you and you might not because this is still pretty early on and you might not have learnt to constantly be wary then later still you have that giant knight dude although to be honest hes slow but that probably wont stop him from annihilating a firsttimer on their first try. Thats not forgetting the presence of the channeler above or the trio of knights below him that will likely result in death at this point if you rush them. And up the stairs? Well you have a knight with a rapier. That one killed me a lot of times and is probably the one enemy I died the most to  particularly because he can parry you and its rare for enemies to do that to you. After that youve encounter the channelers personal army of hollows. Alone theyre not that bad but on your first time? You probably underestimate them and get destroyed by them. Especially if you rush in. Oh and the channeler is very unpleasant if he decides to melee you. And then you have the Gargoyles. A boss! You hopefully dont too badly but then at halfhealth another gargoyle appears! Oh shit for the guys first time playing probably panics and dies. And if theyre like me they abscond into Darkroot Garden running wildly past Andres pet who he has in his basement for some reason. Then you get eaten by a tree not really expecting it. Then you make another run but this time you get to the large open area with the sleepy stone dudes. They get up. Youre intimidated. They slow you down and their hits take off half your health. You panic and die. You go again and this time you reach the Moonlight Butterfly in a mad dash. You die to its magic which does a lot of damage. You go yet again but this time you turn around and enter Darkroot Basin. You go down the cliff and run towards the shiny things except theyre actually crystal golems and theyre painful. But theres also a hydra and its taken notice of you. Uh oh. You panic and run away only to come face toface with a black knight with a halberd. You die because youre on low health and out of estus so close to a bonfire without realising it until you one day return.You respawn at the bonfire in the Parish and notice that theres an elevator in the church. It leads to Firelink Shrine. You go back up to the Gargoyles  getting there  takes many tries but eventually you do. You have another go but you die. And another but you die again. You restore your humanity. You summon. But this makes you overconfident and you die after getting the first gargoyle to half health. You try again this time without summons. Something changes. Instead of panicking you focus on the first gargoyle even when the second appears. The first gargoyle goes down. Then you focus on the second gargoyle which only having half health and no tail and obsessed with breathing fire seems much less dangerous. You achieve victory and you ring the bell. You are finally taking your first true steps on a longer journey. From here on you will never be as stuck as you once were here in the Parish. ,darksouls,dgyqlyf,24,t5_2sazo
