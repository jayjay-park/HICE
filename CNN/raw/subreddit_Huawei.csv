11476384,0,t1_dfwrnji,here are the bands on the Honor  Pro      Bands  and  are the most commonly used LTE bands in North America both US in Canada anyway...and there is some usage of    and ...but they are sparsely used and not compatible with the phone anyway. I read somewhere that Qualcomm owns some kind of patent in the US for certain bands so thats why for example the Galaxy S series US variant have the snapdragon versus exynos....but I dont recall where I read that.      In short no the Honor  Pro will not come to the US and even if you buy one it wont work well if at all on LTE bands and maybe just a bit in g.      edit heres an article in  about how Qualcomm patented and monetized the g bands LTE before they even became relevant ,Huawei,dfwue0v,1,t5_2t5p8
