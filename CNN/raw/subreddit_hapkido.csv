1291247,0,t3_28ruax,Since Hapkido encompasses so many types of techniques you may want to search out a martial art for the summer that would help you with a subset.  Maybe take up BJJ to improve your ground fighting or boxing to improve your punching take up Judo to improve your throws and takedown defense try a weapon art to improve your defense and offense with weapons then bring it back to your Hapkido training at the end of the summer.  Im not sure what other martial arts are available to you but having an instructor is better than trying to do things on your own.The Tedeschi book is okay but it seems more like a encyclopedia rather than an instruction manual.  Youtube may be better and Ive made some videos in the past which may or may not be of interest to you.  You can search for HapkidoJosh on youtube.  Originally I just made the videos for my students but I have gotten some positive feedback from them.  Im not a master or anything and Im sure many people in the Hapkido community dont agree with some of my ideas.  ,hapkido,cievr7v,1,t5_2socy

I was not aware of that when I started Hapkido.Im French and I presume that schools in Nethherlands are not all the same than in my country.As donaldcicc says Hapkido is rare and if you got a school in your area go try.Im not really sure that one Hapkido style is better than another even if they are some little differences. Everything doesnt come from the art but from the practicioner before all.,hapkido,d3bf6pq,2,t5_2socy

For the younger ones though he might push them just a little because theyre young and they can recover faster. I dont know if your instructor would do the same. Maybe you should talk to him her about your concerns? I hope this helps.,hapkido,d7o5u9t,1,t5_2socy
