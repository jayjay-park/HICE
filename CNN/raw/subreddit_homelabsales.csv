6469816,0,t3_449bap,gt I am asking for  for the lotI really dont mean to take a dump on this but a setup like this can be had on eBay for about half of what youre asking and thats including shipping. I doubt youll get any bites at this price.I put together something almost exactly the same but with more QLEx cards for well under  with a different Gb FC switch.,homelabsales,czoiwo8,2,t5_39iie

TB SFF drives arent too hard to come by if you dont mind using laptop grade I think using zfs or btrfs could make this feasible on non windows systems but if you need raid compatible cards its definitely more challenging.,homelabsales,d4g0chq,1,t5_39iie

11282499,0,t1_dfamle0,I basically pulled the trigger on usinginstalling it in my network and got rid of the ISP router I had in place beforehand.  Even though I still want the USG I dont have a backup router to put in place while we deal and the pessimistic voice in my head reminds me Im  for ubnt gear my UAP performance sucks while my ERL performs fine and would be worried about not having tested out the USG before implementing it...  I guess I got rid of the ISP router too soon!  sorry but I think Im content enough with the ERL in place even though I dont have that pretty Unifi interface...,homelabsales,dfaurvy,1,t5_39iie
