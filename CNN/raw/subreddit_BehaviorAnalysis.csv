4847943,0,t3_35t7q2,APBA recently did a survey on this. Basically average for BCBA on east coast tended to fall in K range west coast was K remember standard of living.  an hour may be billable hours which is difficult to obtain  hrs a week think typically its  billable plus unpaid travel and office time. BCBAs in school district in Florida made around K starting. Ive also found it depends largely on the agency itself. In my area high quality agencies paid lower whereas low quality agencies paid much more obviously not saying if you work in a higher pay agency that its low quality.  ,BehaviorAnalysis,cu5mb82,1,t5_2sqoh

6338266,0,t3_41s2ot,Im an instructor therapist IT at a centre for children with ASD. Ive worked as an IT for  years for  different organizations. Most of my clients have been children  yrs old but I have also worked with teenagers over the last couple of years. I love being an IT. Hearing the parents talk about how their children have changed so much since coming to the centre and seeing how happy they are seeing those changes yourself...its such an incredibly rewarding feeling. On the flip side I have dealt with parents that just make you want to bury your head in sand but they tend to be in the minority. My current workplace is unionized and my senior therapist and clinical supervisor have both been incredibly supportive and have given me great feedback which has helped improve my skills. At my current job I make kyr because it is a government agency but Ive also worked for private organizations that paid significantly less ltkyr. I am in Toronto Canada though so I dont know if my compensation is commensurate to what people in similar positions outside Canada get. I have a BCaBA but I dont think certification is as important here yet because I get paid the same amount as my noncertified coworkers and in many places the senior therapists clinical directors and whatnot are either not seeking certification or are just starting to get theirs. ,BehaviorAnalysis,cza39od,1,t5_2sqoh

7806683,0,t3_4m3ey5,Like in any field you may come across clients clients families coworkers who have strong feelings towards the LGBTQ community. I keep my personal life to myself as far as possible because . Frankly its none of their business and . Im a professional and Im here to work not chit chat. That being said if someone youre working forwith does have an issue with your sexualgender identity and you can not agree to come to some understanding I believe youre ethically bound to insist they find another Behavior Analyst as that would be a conflict of interest. Its shitty that its  and this is somehow still an issue but thats what it is.I guess just be careful about crossing any lines of professionalism. You can be friendly with your clients their families and your coworkers. But above all you are a Behavior Analyst and the work comes first. Just my two cents. Good luck!,BehaviorAnalysis,d3tj7om,6,t5_2sqoh

9108873,0,t3_550wjy,They kept telling me to meet new performance targets and theyd make me a full time employee and not probationary. Every time I met a target they gave me a new one and said after this one well make you a full time employee with proper pay.  year later I quit.I dont know of this is relevant. They were always bad it just took me a while to realize ,BehaviorAnalysis,d86qmu7,2,t5_2sqoh

9639878,0,t1_da0t9oa,Thanks very much to both of you for the suggestions. I think they are all valid especially the suggestions about trying FCT again although in the IEP it would contradict what the current SLP recommends which is to not try and teach anything. The pairing of preferred items with nonpreferred activities has been tried with limited success and should be continued however it doesnt fit the states definition of a replacement behavior. I dont agree but thats another topic. The absence of the target behavior isnt good enough even if pairing with preferred items could suppress problem behavior. State would ask what are we teaching that follows the perceived function such as to request escape and preferred items.  A friend suggested trying to teach waiting maybe with a red and green card which might satisfy the requirement but would initially at least put staffs in harms way more than they are now.  ,BehaviorAnalysis,da1baiy,2,t5_2sqoh
