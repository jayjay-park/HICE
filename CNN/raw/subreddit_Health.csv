265982,0,t1_cf8b8qy,I wont comment on your mothers intellect but yes shes certainly hard headed.  The ACA is a system of subsidies tax credits that allow people to buy private insurance.  People making between  of the federal poverty level qualify for a subsidy.  Below that people qualify for Medicaid in states that have expanded Medicaid.  Florida did not expand Medicaid.  The ACA isnt a single insurance plan.  There are numerous private insurance plans to choose from offering different levels of coverage which are assigned by metal colors platinum gold silver and bronze.  I gave you an example of the lowest priced silver plan.  Silver plans have an additional benefit of having deductible and out of pocket maximum cost sharing reductions so its beneficial to sign up for a silver plan if your income is in the range.The ACA also imposes new regulations.  It limits the maximum a person will have to pay out of pocket per year.  It eliminates annual and lifetime maximums on insurance plans.  It does away with preexisting condition exclusions.  And it mandates that insurers provide comprehensive coverage for  essential benefit categories.  Thats about it in a nutshell.  There is a yearly penalty if you dont sign up for qualified coverage.   Frankly Ive dealt with plenty of people like your mom.  The arguments they throw out are mostly flat out lies that theyve heard from some conservative talk radio chain letter website or media outlet.  The propaganda has been incredibly strong.  Ive even seen this one health plan not insurance...a health plan called Patriot Network try to sucker in people to buying their plan and paying the penalty telling people to avoid the ACA exchanges healthcare.gov is where you sign up by the way just to show Obama they wont accept his socialism.  Well that makes no sense.  The ACA is private insurance.  Its subsidizes by tax credits.  Thats about as conservative as you can get.  The Patriot Network plan...well...its a plan for suckers.  It offers no real coverage at all.  If you had a heart attack like that one kids mom youd end up paying the entire bill out of pocket.  So yeah.  Cut the umbilical cord.  Sign up for the ACA.  Be smart.  ,Health,cf8bupt,1,t5_2qh9z

And a few weeks after delivery you would never know they had been pregnant. Theyre all back to their previous weight. I think theres a large percentage of obstetric patients in America who decide Im pregnant now so I can eat whatever I want a perspective that is at least partially reinforced by all the talk about the intersection of food cravings and child wellness.

The kicker is that they dont even care about cross contamination so the extra charge is for nothing. So it goes both ways. My girlfriend is a diagnosed celiac and things like baking are expensive for me to do for her but largely the cost is the same because substitutions are the same price or most meals are gluten free anyway.

However I am intolerant to wheat and am not celiac. I have suffered from acid reflux and ulcers since being a child and was on nexium for about  years. Over that time  the nexium caused me to have malabsorption issues resulting in my magnesium being so low  I was hospitalized with complete muscle tetany. They had not seen it yet and I was tested for everything you can imagine. The only thing my GI could offer was to continue to take the drug and get supplement shots.  That didnt sit well with me so I went the naturopath route. I went paleo and through trial and error found that wheat really makes me ill. A lot of other grains do too as well as excess sugarstarch but wheat kills me and puts me back to square one. Fast forward nearly three years later and Im in the best health of my life.

3732417,0,t3_3342y8,You know I never understood the logic of articles like that. They take vegetables and fruit remove the fiber from them and claim that is an improvement because your GI tract works too much! Really? Isnt fiber suppose to be good for you? Fiber lowers your cholesterol regulates digestive tract and reduces the risk of diabetes among other good things. Dont believe me? Go to Mayo Clinic or some other reputable website. So yes lets remove fiber what a great idea. And what are you left with really? Sugar that is what. Even if you add more vegetables than fruit I bet there is still too much sugar in there not that the article provides nutritional info for its recipes conveniently. Why do I think that? Notice how many of the recipes use carrots as one of the main ingredients. That is because carrots even though they are vegetables not fruit have a good amount of sugar in them and sugar tastes good. A glass of carrot juice has g of sugars and only g of protein. Beets are similar relatively high in sugar. Also when I google vegetablefruit juice recipes with nutritional info I see pretty much straight up carbs that come mostly from sugar. So yes if you want to increase the amount of sugarcarbs in your diet juicing is the way to go.And the blatant lies! In the beginning the article cites that eating fruits and vegetables can lower the risk of cardiovascular disease by . Later in the same article it turns into juicing can lower the risk of cardiovascular disease by . Like its the same thing. That just makes you believe people who wrote it more and more.Now do I think that a glass of juice is bad for you? Well its better than a glass of regular soda that is for sure and it may be a step in the right direction for people with horrible diets but its not THE healthy thing to do and I hate when people start marketing it as such especially using pseudoscientific claims like your GI tracts is working too hard.,Health,cqhpwqd,2,t5_2qh9z

Im guessing some of alternative medicine but no more than a small amount of it will ultimately be validated by science. For instance I have little doubt that green tea will probably be found to have some mild chemopreventative benefit when it comes to cancer. What will NOT be validated by science is quackery like that of Hulda Clark a naturopath who claims to have the cure for all cancers and the cure for AIDS. It ends with However otherwise intelligent people still fall for her quackery because they are desperate to believe anything that might give them hope. In future posts on this topic Ill look at examples of alternative medicine where it isnt so easy to distinguish potentially legitimate treatments from quackery. Ill also be talking about how people can distinguish the scams from alternative medicine that might have value and how a treatment for a disease any treatment whether conventional or alternative should be approached and evaluated for efficacy and risk. In my book ones approach to evaluating the therapeutic value a treatment should be the same regardless of whether it is considered alternative or not.

There are one way valves that make sure any compression only sends it one way.Some of those smooth muscles get weak as they get old so the lymph might not flow as quickly when you age.

There already exist labels for food containing no GMOs  nonGMO certified and organic  In fact a bill just passed by the House of Representatives orders the USDA to develop a plan to certify foods as nonGMO  This bill also makes the voluntary GMO approval process which all GMOs on the market have opted to do mandatory.gt A national survey shows that most Americans pay little attention to the debate over genetically modified foods despite extensive media coverage of the issue. ... Before introducing the idea of GM foods the survey participants were asked simply What information would you like to see on food labels that is not already on there? In response only  percent raised GM food labeling on their own. Rutgers scientists via phys.orggt Of the twentyfour percent who would like to see additional information on the label n ... only three percent less than one percent of the total sample mentioned anything about biotechnology. International Food Information Council PDFPeople cant seem to think of it when its a fillintheblank answer rather than a yes or no question.  However if you ask a yes or no question  of Americans want food containing DNA to be labeledGenetic engineering is a breeding technique not an ingredient that deserves labeling.  Notice how there are no calls for any other breeding technique to be labeled only genetic engineering despite the fact that genetic engineering modifies the genome less than conventional breeding meaning that theyre actually easier to predict and should actually require less regulation although theyre subject to much greater regulation.  Any changes in the nutritional value ingredients or other factors are already and will continue to be listed on the label.gt And the argument that there is nothing new about genetic rearrangement misses the point that GM crops are now the agricultural products most heavily treated with herbicides So go after pesticides not GMOs.gtand that two of these herbicides may pose risks of cancer. Two?  After glyphosate whats the other?Also only one wing of the World Health Organization has accused glyphosate of potentially being dangerous the IARC and that report has come under fire from many people such as the Board for Authorisation of Plant Protection Products and Biocides in the Netherlands and the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment PDF.  Several other regulatory agencies around the world have deemed glyphosate safe too such as United States Environmental Protection Agency the South African Department of Agriculture Forestry amp Fisheries PDF the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority PDF the Swiss Federal Office for Agriculture Belgian Federal Public Service Health Food Chain Safety Environment the Argentine Interdisciplinary Scientific Council and Canadian Pest Management Regulatory Agency.  Furthermore the IARCs conclusion conflicts with the other three major research programs in the WHO the International Program on Chemical Safety the Core Assessment Group and the Guidles for Drinkingwater Quality,Health,cv5n841,11,t5_2qh9z

They are both corrupt and hypocritical and I wont hesitate to call someone out who is on either side of the aisle. Even according to your provided graph a big chunk of the spending is the continued wars Obama said he was going stop. The hypocrisy is again palpable that he has kept them going. He was not elected to make excuses and blame the previous guy he was elected to make change and stop the wars and at this point he owns them as much as Bush.The Bush era tax cuts had a sunset provisions that made them expire at the end of . In  during the fiscal cliff the tax cuts were made permanent for single people making less than  per year and couples making less than  per year. So can you still blame Bush when it was made permanent under Obama? Is there anything attributable to the sitting president when it his signature that turns it into a law? Is he ever to blame for any of his actions or can he just forever blame the other guy?You seem to confuse deficit and debt. Its like saying just because your minimum payment to your credit card is going down that your spending is not out of control even though you have hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt to your credit card companies. You seem to not want to challenge your belief that Obama holds any responsibility for anything bad that occurs during his administration. Im no fan of the Republicans either as they have been turning on their electorate and accommodating Obamas spending. You remember when they stood up to him for a short time by trying to keep his spending in check with the budget however the media was painting it like they were shutting down the government since they were not giving Obama a blank check to spend as he pleased. Just because the spending has slowed doesnt mean it is improving the debt it just means the ship sinking slower since there is less water breaching the hull. As far ACAObamacare goes I know it has helped the big insurance companies to make a lot of money. My healthcare payment has gone up since it took affect and I am low income so it has not helped me or anyone I know. It is again this repeating theme in his administration that big business is rewarded and the poor and middle class gets to pay for it. ,Health,cwyi401,1,t5_2qh9z

The only people who seem to be uncomfortable are you and the other bigot clowns.Ive never once been bothered by a woman in my bathroom. Today literally fucking today a lady on a phone walked in to the bathroom at my work  to get in the utility closet while I was taking a shit and society kept on trucking with no problems.Did that lady have a penis? I dont know. Did they consider themselves a man? I dont know. Know why? Its none of my goddamn business what anatomy they have or how they identify. At a bar a few weeks ago I had to take a piss and seeing that the mens bathroom was occupied I pissed in the womens toilet. Not a single lady in the bar was outraged. The female bar attendant didnt lose their shit and call any pigs. Know why? No one cares except for stupid fucking bigots and there werent any of those present.You and your lot are pathetic.

Eating healthy doesnt mean a flying shit there is no such definition. Eating healthy in Africa means one thing eating healthy in the Polar Circle totally a different thing. Catch my drift? Here Ill make it simple especially for you the self sufficient smartass  Monkeys dont eat salmon and Inuits dont munch bananas.About that poor decision making  it is NOT ironic that the poor make poor decisions and have unhealthy eating habits the ironic part is that in the st century there are vast swaths of poor people in the most developed country like the US. Thats the fucken bitter irony. Ofc they are to blame for making uneducated poor and unhealthy decisions.Its never the system right? Its the fucken poor that dont buy black caviar and organic food with their  per week for food and who cant afford the deductibles and the copays. Hilarious. Whats next you gonna tell me about the poor  that they are lazy and why dont they sell kidneys if they wanna be healthy?And no Im not bitter just dont like that kind of egocentered social blindness typical of the US establishment and even of the lower middle class that blames everything on the individual as if she is not a part of the matrixsystem but some selfdestructive maniac.,Health,d2r4ujp,4,t5_2qh9z

So she probably doesnt need to drink caffeine. But I do. It is her job to look goodgt  My biggest struggle was breakfast. I literally had no idea what to eat.gt The second day I woke up yet again unsure of what to eat for breakfast. So I skipped breakfast and settled for coffee. By the way not only is this extremely unhealthy but Tom and Gisele dont have caffeine. Call that a cheat meal I guess?gt I woke up the third day of my diet knowing in my soul that I could not continue. As I trudged to the dining hall I couldnt think of my breakfast banana without wanting to vom. So instead I made a beeline to the breakfast line and devoured two helpings of home fries. Boom. Diet over.So which is it?   Is it that you need caffeine and are willing to cheat to get it or is it that you dont know how to do it or that you really want french fries?You did not try the diet for a week.  You tried it for two days.When I quit grains sugar booze dairy and started eating way more fruits amp veggies so not unlike you I didnt quit coffee.  As such Ive managed to stick with it for  years.  Ive had a few cheat meals along the way but thats maybe once a month.  Its not hard.  I do it because I feel better.  Its worth it.  gt  It is not hard. Dont you dare tell us this is hard.

The doctors may do a great job and diagnose your condition and come up with a list of possible ways to treat it. That list might be a go to physical therapy for  months and continue with follow up appiontments ideally or b take these pills that will mask the pain and kick the can down the road. Insurance will come back and say we will cover pills or  weeks of PT at  sessions per week max. Clearly physical therapy would be the best option if it were available to the patient as long as they need it to properly fix the problem but thats a long process and a lot of money. Insurance company want to minimize their costs so they figure pills are the cheap and easy solution. ,Health,d3ra58q,1,t5_2qh9z

9830954,0,t1_dann2gg,Apologies if that seemed a bit defensive but my point is it is all bit more nuanced than hunger and insulin spikes and carbs is my point.  Your comment within the tree seemed to be following that same line of thought and its misleading in its simplicity.Human physiology is a complicated thing as is the obesity epidemic  so its frustrating to see it boiled down so simply when it is anything but.  Overeating and lack of activity is a large component but there are psychological issues afoot as well as genetic issues.Either way I am sure we would probably agree on more things than not regarding what constitutes a healthy diet processed foods being one of the primary problems with the modern diet.  And while maybe I got the wrong impression from your post it seemed like another suggestion that all carbs fall into this category.  Thats why I pointed out the bit about starches and sugars.  Starches and simpler sugars can be found in healthy unprocessed forms of food  tubers and grains fruits and vegetables.White potatoes are a starch and while they have very little fiber rank among the most satiating foods to eat.  Beans are a starch and usually have a higher fiber content and rank among the most satiating foods to eat.  We need to look at the diet as a whole though and how people eat.  People eat mixed meals and we know that fat and fiber slow gastric release  digestion.  It is through this process that the release of blood sugar is steadied and slowed and so this provides a good example as to why the idea of insulin being the culprit is misguided.  Many people have poor eating habits in general they eat shit food and they sit on their ass for overwhelming majority of the day.  They have become accustomed to snacking and they take all sorts of cues as signs of hunger though few will ever experience true hunger.  This is the root of the problem and this main point of the original post.  So shifting into some tangent on carbs and keto and insulin is again misguided and unnecessary.  Keto is an unnecessary extreme but if it works for you and others than that is a good thing but that doesnt provide proof of anything.I am glad you have found an eating pattern that works for you and I have enjoyed strict periods of keto dieting in the past as well.  I do think that carb intake should be an individual thing but this is something people in this day and age find hard to appreciate.  Its a yes or no either or approach for many.  You have people peddling this idea that carbs are the primary cause for weight gain diabetes and other metabolic syndromes.  This isnt supported in the research.  This is essentially what is being intimated in the comments above.Its amazing how much is unknown regarding the human body which is why making things out so simply on a site like Reddit where a lot of people are bound to see it is so misguided.  Posts like the above ones suggest as if the answer has been found as if a clear problem has been identified but its disingenuous because its not true.Again apologies if that came across as defensive and even more so if the above seems a bit standoffish.,Health,daoztp0,1,t5_2qh9z

10011080,0,t3_5j06ok,as a resident there are a few issues with this article.. the current hr rule only applies to firstyear residents. Im in a year surgery residency and after my first year it went back to  hours. not only does it cause undue stress on scheduling the restricted duty hours have actually NOT been associated with worse patient outcomes but with increased handoffs and residents feeling like theyre missing out on important learning. specific to surgical residencies see the First Trial. Historically it was always up to  hours. In  Libby Zion died as a result of a medical error which prompted the increased regulations. However much of this was secondary to POLITICAL pressure she was daughter of Sidney Zion a lawyer who had been a writer for The New York Times.. Since Libby Zion died in  we have many additional safeguards in place which prevent errors like these. More pharmacist oversight on floor patients electronic medical records which flash warnings for drug interactions and as residents we are much more in tune to overworking to the point where we are constantly encouraged to call help from other residents and theres even a service which will drive me home if i feel too tired to drive.basically the initial changes were made more due to political pressure and not evidence based. the changes caused increased patient handoffs and required more crosscoverage where doctors not as familiar with patients were covering not to mention the hour rule which only applies to the first year. Through the First Trial for surgical residencies and the currently underway Medicare outcomes for medicine residencies trial we have increasing information that the  hour rule is not better at protecting patients but leads to concerns over training deficits.,Health,dbch0tk,1,t5_2qh9z

10441224,0,t3_5pjcz6,What a great idea. Let insurance companies insure only healthy people in order to insure ensure their maximum profits and reduce their risk to near zero. Segregate everyone that the insurance companies reject into high risk pools that they wont be able to afford because they are likely sick and unemployable and because these high risk pools will be many times more expensive than plans for the healthy only. And talk about choice. The people in the high risk pools will be able to have any kind of plan they want from any provider and theyll be able to go to any doctor they want to  at least as long as its spelled out explicitly by the government agency administering the high risk pool.  If there is anything that will keep American citizens from getting sick in the first place it will be fear of getting tossed into the high risk pools.  If there is anything that will make sick Americans get healthy and return to being working productive citizens again it will be the desire to be able to get back onto a regular insurance plan . . . except for the fact that most of them will never be able to get out of the high risk pools  because once you have a preexisting condition you always have a preexisting condition.

Not so great for people and families who have had or will have medical setbacks. But hey someone has to sacrifice.,Health,dcrlaik,2,t5_2qh9z

11592132,0,t1_dg9ynrx,The key thing here is the type rather than the quantity of pathogens and the route of access. In a congested city like New York yes you are getting germs on every subway rail and streetlight corner however your food is sterile! You arent drinking milk straight from a cow you arent playing in the dirt and the TYPE of microorganism profile you get is going to be much different than living in a rural area. Whats especially key is these worms since IgE antibodies are SPECIFICALLY made to fight such parasites however... you wont generally find that in your New York City pizza hopefullySome of the feedback Ive gotten is that some people who live in rural areas arent even familiar with the concept of allergies.  And yes some more data wouldve been nice in the video thank you for bringing that out. Here is the data Im using The International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood ISAAC showed that the prevalence of selfreported asthma ranged from  in developing countries to  of the responding population of year olds in industrialized countries. The probiotic video is taking a lot of research and consultation with medical faculty to put out since like you said is a field where consensus hasnt been reached.  And because nutritional supplements are NOT regulated by FDA for approval they can make health claims that stop just short of saying we can cure xyz disease.  Might release my video on this whole ampme stuff thats coming out since the backlash might be sizeable. Thanks for watching and giving your feedback! ,Health,dg9z5ti,2,t5_2qh9z
