They should be read and borrowed from to make your own game however Esteren is quite heavily focused on story and its hard to create an own plot for it. My reccomendation is to get book  free on drivethrurpg and run the nd premade in that book if you are new to GMing if you are experienced run the first premade called Loch Varn... but do read the  premade campaign at least twice before running it. the GM screen is nice but not really needed as for where to buy it i cant help with that as I dont live in the US which I assume you are.Bonus Yes i have a roll group European one and open spots. But we have a break for christmas and wont start back up until th of january.,Esteren,cy9xtrj,2,t5_2xmp7
