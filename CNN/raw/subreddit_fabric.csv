4443989,0,t3_3bwqwg,You will not likely find the exact match. ...or even close. You are best off trying to match it with a solid or similar brocade.I believe the name of that fabric could be described as brocade. If the weave is the same on the other side but the colours are reversed it is also a Jaquard weave. However if you can see through the fabric I am just now trying to look at it close up and it looks a little like a drapery lace. can we see another pic with your hand behind it? Is that maybe the lampshade cardboard that it is mounted on?,fabric,csqumu1,1,t5_2rb4w
