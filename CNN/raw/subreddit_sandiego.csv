206808,1,t1_cf1zldd,gt A beer drinking surfer is less serious than Snoo coming out of a whales vagina? There have been a few posts in the last year asking that Shamu be removed and the majority of people have agreed.Yes I acknowledge that the earlier version right or wrong is based on what many may not realize is sort of a inside joke from anchormanThe problem is that its been established and is now kind of edgy and irreverent...  which does fit well with San Diegos long established culture of being somewhat maverick minded and going against propriety that is in a nutshell California gt AFAIK theres no requirement that subreddits have to operate this way. There are plenty of subreddits that follow different conventions for subreddit image placement even rwebdesign!rwebdesign is strictly centered ... thats fine but a bit awkward with the left justification of the links.Concerning the rsandiego pageThat observation isnt based on some reddit of internet rule its based on human image processing and how we have specific neurons that are dedicated to alignments and visual spacing when processing groups or non groups.  the elements are too widly spaced and you cant have left justification mixed with centering.  It causes a disruption visually and in peoples processing when mixing the two visual languages syntaxYou can rearrange the elements any way you wish but as long as the composition is effective in its purpose. Which is .... easy processing and communication for the viewer.  D,sandiego,cf1zyzu,2,t5_2qq2q

If you try to get into areas your badge wont allow someone is alerted aside from the fact the door didnt open for you.  Getting an airport badge isnt easy.  Especially one that lets you into sterile areas.  Vendors and their employees can get badges to get into terminals so they can work and Id like to think though obviously not the case that the ground crew cant get up into the terminals.  But theres a lot of unique situations where they might need to.Theres cameras everywhere. To think otherwise would be foolish. ,sandiego,cg6c82y,5,t5_2qq2q

690882,0,t1_cgi9yzw,Well true outofseason rain would be perhaps less accurate than outofseason dry followed by rain. San Diego Rainfall by MonthThe immense shortfall in December and January coupled with the hot dry weather was especially tough on native herbaceous plant life. The late rains are too late to let native plants have a normal growing season and the relatively faster growing grasses will spread in their absence and crowd out their return. ,sandiego,cgit06q,1,t5_2qq2q

No worries about getting mauled to death by lions or crocodiles or other hippos fighting for territory. The water will always be clean and wont dry up.

It might be difficult for a foreigner to deal with all the red tape. Second the stars would really have to align for you to sell that thing before you leave because you cant really sell it too early since thats where youre living but if you wait too long then you might have to leave before you got a buyer. The other thing is that you really roll the dice with whatever repairs come up. Sure the electric and the stove and all that works now according to the ad but those things have a way of going south pretty quickly after being used regularly following a long period of nonuse on a camper this age  and I dont think zed here wants to risk having his family of  living in an RV with no electric or stove or paying what could be several hundred dollars or more in repairs.I like the way youre thinking but I think it could wind up being a lot more trouble for a guy in this position than its worth. ,sandiego,ch4oj4q,5,t5_2qq2q

I usually end up heading over to Players in Clairemont since I live this way. Of course there is always Typhoons in PB but that place gets pretty wild. Ive been to McGreggors near Qualcomm at the corner of S.D. Mission Rd and Rancho Mission Rd a few times for games. Cool spot has pool amp shuffleboard but it may be packed tonight since people like to pregame there before heading over to Qualcomm. When I used to live in East County I would hit up Hooleys both at Grossmont Center and Rancho SD. Both cool spots if you have the urge to head out that way. If you feel like heading downtown one of my favorite spots to watch football and grab a few brews is Gaslamp Tavern at th amp E St. Its close to the action of Gaslamp but I have never really seen it be super packed. Either way the game is on NFL Network tonight so any sports bar or any bar for that matter should be able to get the game on. Have fun and remember there are always other fish in the sea.

Protesting on a freeway instantly becomes a safety issue because either the protesters will get hurt or one a car wont notice the traffic ahead and plow into a stopped car. If they wanted to bring attention to their cause they should do like the Veterans for Peace do every Thursday and protest from the sidewalk on an overpass downtown.

2488903,0,t3_2o2gxm,Kind of agree with the poster who was downvoted for suggesting the whole thing sounded suspicious but for a different reason. The whole point of a service dog is to be with someone  hours a day to provide help with daily activities from going to the bathroom to answering the door. The posted photo does not appear to show someone who is blind or physically disabled and would require a service dog. The Find Kia Facebook Page shows the owner out on a road bike looking for her dog. How is someone who rides a road bike physically disabled? Any everyone knows someone who orders the vest and gets a certificate off the internet or from a doctor so they can take their dog on planes and into restaurants. At the most this seems like a therapy dog and yes it does matter because hundreds of people lose their dogs every day and very few of them get the help of a TV station in finding their dog. All dogs are therapy dogs by their very nature whether they have the vest or not and very few are true service dogs. I hope she finds her dog and I know this will get downvoted but her Find KIA Facebook Page which the OP linked to in another posting does seem to be an attention fest  ,sandiego,cmjfrws,-12,t5_2qq2q

It seemed fun so i asked about it.They start off with two weekends off clinics where you have a number on your shirt and the coaches are taking notes through out the drills. The day after the last clinic they have a draft for the league just like the NFL or Fantasy Football.This is a predominately gay league. That being said I am a straight male and had a blast last year. I expected to absolutely dominate but this is a competitive league! It is COOP and even if you have never played before the coaches and peers make it very easy to catch on quickly.Ive been told that this is a great way to find a new gay community. Ive already built some of my best friendships in just the first year. All in all if it is too early this year theres always next.

Which in turn means theyre trying to be transparent and yadayadauada or whatever else crappy stuff it can mean. Which in turn means that they are more than likely a more credible source than Joe schmoe.Vet them? Theyre the police. I trust them over you.

Disregard it... Or not understand what is really happening it something else.Like WWII and what the US did to the Japanese. The US didnt have the man power so they locked up all the Japanese because they were all biased towards Japan. We couldnt vet them.

3692820,0,t1_cqby19j,It it is not possible for every other team from the division to win every single game up till the break as those teams also play each other and only one can win each of those games. For the same reason suppose you could create a situation where every team but the padres has an  record and the Padres are . If the Padres won every remaining game they would be . But the teams above them would play each other and at least one of them would have to accept a win giving them more than  wins. A true mathematical elimination calculation uses a networkflow simulation not just a gamesbehind subtraction as it can account for this factor. It might be fun to do a probabilistic elimination Consider a team probabilistically eliminated when there does not exist a binomial distribution that could generate their previous winloss record within a  confidence interval that would also if the future expected value of wins is calculated would overcome their gamesbehind gap from the leading team.

A coolant flush is not a bad idea it could also need a thermostat also possibly a fan clutch.gt Rough Idle. seems to idle low nowadays. about    rpm idle   Again many things that could contribute. Idle motor dirty air filter old plugs dirtyold airflow meter. Cooling system being out of whack can also cause rough idle as the ECU uses the coolant temperature to know how to fuel the engine.Old leakyness is a common thing. Slow leaks make a mess but dont really hurt anything. Theyre fine to put off while you address the larger issues. Basically I address the biggest leaks first so its easier to figure out what else is leaking. Taking care of the power steering will help.

To make the stadium it would have to be filled and operational with a BIG event every weekend.   That itself would be both a disruption to the city... traffic and other issues.But that the user base sports fans would burn out on it all and the expense time of going.  Right now its just a seasonal thing for most people... but thats unsustainable.   Ive worked in event advertising and promotion for over  years here in this city as well as in the western region of the USA.This included the largest concert series in the state before Coachellas success Without going into too much detail I do know something about the management of the consumer market and what it does mean to draw too heavily from the well so that you lose the customer base. To put it simply you cant have a big event everyday... or every week. gt Theres no reason that a new football stadium couldnt host events just like the ones going on at Petco Park.Dividing the market to support an increase number of larger venues?The market has not grown and will not grow enough to justify another new large venue. As Johns piece pointed out.... Stadiums have a ever shortening lifespan. They mostly sit around being useless shells that suck in money for basic maintenance and upgrades demanded by the teams!.Its simply the wrong formula. Theyre playing games theyre not producing anything of any real worth or durable value.  Its all just a losing situation and we dont need any team or stadium for any reason. People do like to get together and feel connected to others and this has been built up to provide the excuse as well as augment the personal identities of some people.

UCSDs schools of medicine and engineering are highlyranked  a quick Google search will back me up  worldclass in my opinion. Theres a reason so much biotech has grown up near it geographically. Thats a whole other debate though. Back to the stadium thing and the putting a city on the map notion. Yeah this is absolutely one of the intangibles and its a real one for sure. It is in fact probably the best argument in favor of courting the Chargers...  well an NFL team. Maybe not the Chargers. I think the question would be a lot easier to answer for a team which had consistently shown a championship mentality. In my opinion the Chargers have not done that not by any stretch.Other towns do indeed manage to score similar culture points in other ways. Austin TX having as its mostfamous sports team only the UT Longhorns for example still manages to attract a relatively skillederudite population. Enough that Dell and a number of other hightech companies and industries including a significant portion of the computer games development industry have grown there. Perhaps UT itself is a part of this. Perhaps another part is in attracting and hosting events like SouthbySouthwest San Diegos ComicCon is a parallel concept perhaps? Maybe the better money is invested in growing our straining convention center?San Diego has a lot of offer beyond the Chargers and shouldnt tie its selfesteem up too much in worrying about them.

This increase falls within the density range of  dwelling units per net residential acre established by the Specific Plan and is comparable with surrounding residential developments located within the boundaries of the urban node.gtgtThe Central Subarea section of the Community Plan discusses the issue of interjecting highrise residential elements into existing lowdensity development patterns as project amendments in order to achieve maximum overall density. A policy recommendation of the Community Plan is for structures within the Central Subarea to be master planned so that their total impact can be reviewed on the basis of a total project concept and integrated with other elements within and adjacent to the project site.gtgt To accommodate the desired number of units within the . acre site the project proposes two story towers and two story towers.

Im male and a bit older  but was where you are now about three weeks ago when I decided that I didnt like who I was and needed to change.  I have three kids and look at my inlaws and think that I dont want to be where they are physically in  years and need to make a major change.  My challenges are that Im super busy with school a fulltime job and a small business on the side.  I also really really really like food....a lot.  But I had to decide what did I like more my kids or food and the kids won.  But because there is no processed food at our house and everything is cooked from scratch MyFitnessPal was a waste of time for me.  Additionally in case I hadnt mentioned it I really really like food so one of my biggest obstacles is portion control and I found an easy solution.  If Im making a good food choice carrots for instance or apples I can eat as much as I want.  I literally have to use a mixing bowl to eat my salads.  Ive read a lot and spoke to a lot of people and what I found works best for me may or not be the best for you you have to decide for yourself is a plant based diet basically vegan without the animal rights baggage.  If you want to learn more Id recommend watching the movie on Netflix called Forks Over Knives  Ive also gotten good information from these books the first two were recommended by medical professionals a cardiac nurse and a primary care physician both eating a plant based dietEat to Live!The Pleasure TrapEngine  DietIf you want any more information feel free to PM me as I mentioned Im just starting on this journey myself but Im feeling better than I have in a long long time.      ,sandiego,ctz9umk,2,t5_2qq2q

Also Gigabit is a lot different than GiggaBYTE.A bit is  the size of a Byte that is the standard unit of file size in most situations when not talking about ISP speedsThey could measure everything in the way sub MegaByte files are Which is to go down the next level of Kilobyte kb for small files.Its all a bait and switch to create confusion so people will think theyre getting something  times faster than what the reality is.The new cox service is only offering MB megaBYTE transfer speedsyou can expect a lot lower actual transfer rates and DATA CAPS for people to discover either in the small print or at the end of the month billing.Real world data transfer is likely to be around MBsecSure its still plenty fast and better than their mb speed they have a their basic package. read .

5549316,0,t1_cwkknyt,A creepy encounter with a shopper at a yard sale sent a mother racing to call police.Then police told her that man is a convicted sex offender.The incident happened on Sunday in front of Micki Paynes Clairemont home on Cole Way.You just have that icky feeling that something is incorrect said Payne.Payne said a man in his s with shoulderlength white hair showed up an hour before her yard sale. Then after it began Payne said he stood behind his white pickup truck on the street.He was hiding behind the truck taking pictures said Payne.Later after browsing through girls clothing at the sale she said his hand started to shake as he paid for a bag of clothes.He fumbled them all and the quarters went to the ground said Payne.Soon after as Payne stood near her yearold daughter she saw something that made her heart stop.As my daughter bends over to take care of the dog he takes the camera off the table and takes a picture of her as shes bending over. At that minute there is rage and a lot of anger said Payne.A stunned Payne quickly called police and when they showed up and talked to the man Payne learned the man was a sex offender.Then came another surprise  police told Payne they couldnt look at his camera.A  Supreme Court decision restricts searches of cellphone and cameras. For some sex offenders including most that are no longer on parole police cant search their cameras without their consent.In this case the man didnt give it.Payne searched the Megans Law website for her surrounding area and a found a possible match but she isnt sure. News has asked police to release the mans identity but they have not done so as of Friday evening.Payne posted her story on the website Nextdoor and received several responses from others who claim hes been seen in the neighborhood possibly at Whitman Elementary School.,sandiego,cwkxzxd,14,t5_2qq2q

5909503,0,t3_3w8v31,Honestly it depends. It can go anywhere between  depending on how many kids there are the age the duties and the hours. I am a babysitter myself and after babysitting for a few months Ive determined that my rate depends on how far the location is from my home how much work I would be doing how many hours it is and  how consistent the babysitting is. Anyways Care usually gives a good idea of rates but Sitter City doesnt I believe. May I ask how many children you have and the hours it may be? I can give a better estimate. ,sandiego,cxu9ol2,2,t5_2qq2q

Stay away from Pacific Beach Ocean Beach or anything south of downtown. Ive lived many places in San Diego and Little Italy is by far the best.

Also that many people do in fact get written off in the current system for financial reasons.The for profit model that maximizes inefficiency waste and expense that we have currently see above article has to be replaced.  When a friend of mine could neither work or walk around his own home due to the need of a hip replacement he discovered it cheaper for him to fly to another country pay its premiums for a hip surgery stay a week to recover and then fly back across the Atlantic all first class and still have money left over than to drive to a hospital in town and have it done here I was appalled.We need an honest and clear discussion on this.

I wish San Diegans could vote to do both the stadium for the Chargers and upgrading the convention center. Since the Chargers situation is in crisis fine do that first. I assure you that temperamentally I strongly prefer compromise and accomodation in all aspects of life. But when it comes to contiguous vs. noncontiguous Im afraid Im inflexible.

7185626,0,t1_d1uoejc,I think you are being a little too overzealous with your claim that its a sham.  I think they are a separate species.  Or a subspecies.  They are different enough to get separate scientific classifications.  Everything I have read indicates to me that there is enough there to classify them as a separate species.  Grouping as you described it is not practiced my a majority of those in the field at least according to the evolutionary biologists I know I can title drop with the best of them.  I think a more accurate statement would be there is disagreement in the scientific community on whether or not they are a separate and distinct species.  Its not a sham its science figuring things out.  And yes the Safari Park does need money for research and the last of a kind does help but they arent being malicious and lots of other research institutions do the same.Heres another viewpoint straight from wikipedia  I checked the sources they are as valid as the one you provided.gtFollowing the phylogenetic species concept recent research has suggested the northern white rhinoceros may be an altogether different species rather than a subspecies of white rhinoceros in which case the correct scientific name for the former is Ceratotherium cottoni. Distinct morphological and genetic differences suggest the two proposed species have been separated for at least a million years. However the results of the research were not universally accepted by other scientists.,sandiego,d1uxyvd,2,t5_2qq2q

7358724,0,t1_d2dojmk,Im speculating huh? Lets just start with a small list of articles that outline how stadiums bring virtually no economic benefit to the surrounding area yet if you read proposals put forth by professional sports teams they claim stadiums are economic saviors and its a good deal for everybody.And then you have this article where an economic report paid for by the Chargers says that a new stadium in Carson would have been a huge economic benefit for the area. Its all bullshit. As for the bonds I have no problem with the bonds themselves. Theyre good investments because anything backed by the power of taxation has a very small chance of default. And those bonds do get bought by little old grannies... I know this because I used to sell municipal bonds including ones for stadiums to individual investors as a financial advisor. The ones getting taken advantage of in these deals are you me and every other taxpayer. We subsidize stadiums where the majority of the revenue that they generate is kept by the team owners. Again if stadiums were such a great investment there would be private investorsdevelopers lining up to put money into them but they know better than to finance a monstrous building that sits empty the majority of the year.

Seeing smaller rentals being built with a focus on amenity space.  When the millennial cohort ages Im one of them gets to family raising age SD single family housing is going to blow up and rental units will depress. When people get married and have kids theyre not going to want to live in a  sf apartment.  Despite new rentals there is still a shortage of housing in North County and other neighborhoods outside San Diego. Poway for instance is adding a lot of jobs but theres little new housing.  Lack of mini downtowns  LA has Century CityBeverly Hills Santa Monica and Downtown LA. We have downtown SD anddddd... UTC? We need a commercial core in North County in Escondido. Theres plenty of housing to be built in Murrieta and Temecula and this is a perfect area to develop up. See most people commute like  minutes in San Diego.

8868926,0,t3_51p347,Having worked in auto insurance claims I can positively say this is a pure money grab in the form of a bodily injury claim. While on paper the truck driver  is at fault  this is a complete bullshit claim. The white sedans driver will almost positively get some cheesy injury attorney from billboards around tow think King Aminpore advertised on buses and build a case around alleged soft tissue injuries sustained as a result of the truck drivers negligence.The claimant in the white sedan will be sent to the lawyers preferred chiropractor rake up  in chiropractor bills for that office. Once a huge medical bills can be cited on paper that lawyer will contend to the Trucks auto insurance company that the driver of the white sedan went through a tremendous amount of pain and suffering to extract more  out of the truck drivers insurance policy.So after inflating the medical bills and threatening to sue the insurance company the lawyer  of the time settles and proceeds to charge a  fee of the total settlement amount from the injured driver  ripping them off as well. You can bet your ass tho if the insurance company ever got this video  they would  almost DARE the attorney to take this to trial so a jury could see the video of this asshole causing the accident.  The case would be droppedsettled in a second. ,sandiego,d7dx54f,19,t5_2qq2q

Were considering a few homes in Carmel Valley in the Torrey Hills area southwest Carmel Valley and near the intersection of El Camino Real amp San Dieguito Rd northwest Carmel Valley.  Its interesting to see the diversity of responses in terms of evening commute time.  Not having done the commute yet I tended to agree more with the replies from Catdogkids khbruin and CoachZed.  I guess the best way to find out is to do the commute myself which Ill have an opportunity to do next week.  Id be ok with an evening commute time of somewhere between  minutes but an evening commute time of an hour every day would be more than what Id want.  Were accustomed to living in areas where venturing out during the evening rush hour from  pmish is not easy and Im coming off a job in the Northeast where I had a  minute oneway drive tofrom work so I guess everything is relative i.e. a  minute oneway commute will be a pleasure!,sandiego,d7pl7yh,2,t5_2qq2q

9117406,0,t1_d87m4xr,You can ignore it if youd like but the fact is that a police officer shooting an unarmed civilian causes more tension unrest and feelings of if not actual oppression than a civilian killing a police officer. Those factors for those that dont choose to ignore them are real actual harms. The situation that causes less harm should be preferred. Thus we should prefer the killing of a police officer by a citizen to the killing of an unarmed citizen by a police officer.Edit The real problem here is that were talking about police vs. unarmed suspects but to you that means police vs. criminals.

Now that theyve switched to being Spectrum the only chance I have to lower my rate is to switch to a Spectrum plan at xMbps for mo. I am really enjoying having the extra upload bandwidth so I dont want to go down to Mbps up. Its just so fucking infuriating. Time Warner spent untold millions of dollars upgrading their network to support  Mbps speeds and now Spectrum has killed that. Google Fiber would have been a godsend.You mention gigabit speeds on DOCSIS . but it wont be anywhere near as good as Fiber. It will be asymmetrical. You may be able to get  Gbps down but your upload speed would likely only be  Mbps at maximum. Granted that is quite fast. But it it will never be as good as fiber.,sandiego,d982s1m,5,t5_2qq2q

9558071,0,t1_d9r6wvp,gt But we can probably find a better way to revitalize downtown rather than plop down a new stadium every few blocks right?If you move aside the funding issue or feelings for the owner of the team one fact is that only a massive project like a stadium is going to be able to remove the bus garage.  If the goal is to have a dense community there one would assume that at some point you have to move the bus garage.  Personally I think the best path forward now is for the Chargers to leave and for San Diego to double down on Conventions.  They should build the expansion on the main convention center to keep large events like ComicCon happy but they should also build a second smaller convention center on the stadium site.  The one part of the pitch for the Convadium that I agreed with was if San Diego had multiple convention centers it could benefit from running both large and small events.  What I never agreed with turning away from MEGA conventions like ComicCon.  ,sandiego,d9r88ll,8,t5_2qq2q

I only chose Mision  because it seems to get themost press press here meaning hits on a Google search but Ill tryand check those out as well and see if I can take her there.gt Its safe! Even if you go to the redlight district they bother mostly drunks at night not a couple during a day trip.I think out of all the things Ive researched so far the safety factoris the one with the most varied responses from various people Ivequeried. Some say it is a Baghdadlike warzone where well getkidnapped others say it is as safe as Tokyo.We plan on staying far from the redlight district. Well just go out to the restaurant for dinner and back so I dont anticipate any problems.gt Mision  is in a building known as Via Corporativo o Edificio Inteligente so make sure you tell your Uber driver that.Yeah. Google Maps shows the building and neighborhood pretty well.gt Grab the Uber a distance away from the border taxis thats the only thing I recommend. After crossing the border taxis will bother the hell out of you. Walk straight like walking to downtown cross the bridge call Uber there.Yeah from look at the maps I figured out what everyone is trying tosay. The street closest to the pedestrian ramp is apparently crowdedwith taxis most of whom take a dim view of Uber so well walk a bitfurther in and call an Uber away from them.gt If you are lucky less than  if you are unlucky more than an hour.

Not adjustable  its two more things to check when putting it on  off to boulder etc.. Auto locking waist buckle. Again quicker and you cant forget to double it back. Some reasonable padding  width on the waist and legs Dont care about how many gear loops above  but I prefer them to be rigid rather than cord with a plastic sheath.  Dont care about haul loops or anything like that Somewhere in the middle of the size range for the waist loop I avoid anything that claims to be adjustable from small to xxlIm a lot more picky about my trad harness. For the gym though it is all about simple.My suggestion is go to REI and put on every mens harness they have. Compare padding ease of use of the buckles and how easy it is to clip  unclip quickdraws onto the gear loops. Ideally they will have something you can clip into and hang in the harness to see how it feels. Wear your usual climbing gear  not jeans. Buy the cheapest one you like.,sandiego,daimh02,3,t5_2qq2q

10209635,0,t3_5m7a6d,Good luck I failed my test twice one time in Downtown and another in Chula Vista I finally passed it on my rd try in Clairemont. Here are general tips.Steer smoothly at all times.Accelerate smoothly. Dont race the engine or make it stall.Stop the vehicle gently. Start braking well ahead of where you must stop to avoid sudden jerks. Know where to stop. Be aware of crosswalks. If your view is blocked at a crosswalk move forward carefully and look both ways before entering the intersection..Be sure your vehicle is in the correct gear. Dont grind the gears. Dont coast to a stop.Always obey the posted speed limits. If needed reduce your speed to adjust for existing weather road and other traffic conditions. Remember to turn on your lights if you need to use your windshield wipers in poor weather conditions.Follow at a safe distance. Use the threesecond rule. Increase your following distance in bad weather or poor visibility.Know what the traffic signals mean and obey them at all times.Always use the proper lane. Turn from the correct lane into the correct lane.Signal for all lane changes and turns.Always look for potential hazards scan. Check your mirrors frequently. Always look over the proper shoulder before making lane changes or pulling away from the curb.Drive defensively. Anticipate another drivers errors.,sandiego,dc1bhy4,1,t5_2qq2q

10243353,0,t3_5mn125,I moved to San Diego a little over two years ago. I get paid as an independent contractor mostly reported to the IRS on misc forms. Maybe Im the weird one here but shortly after arriving in San Diego I looked into it and discovered that I had to pay an annual business tax. I pay it End of story.It makes sense for self employedcontractor income to be taxed by the city. We use city roads and other city services so we should pay for it the same as anybody getting a W.Slightly related I used to have an LLC for the liability protection but folded it when I moved to California to avoid paying the minimum  per year state franchise tax. I now purchase general liability and errors and omission insurance instead which is cheaper than paying the annual tax.  Which makes me think California should lower their minimum business franchise tax so that Id be more inclined to give the state the money instead of some stupid insurance company.,sandiego,dc5530s,3,t5_2qq2q

10328091,0,t3_5ntr7p,More than I can count.    My best story. I was back in Ohio visiting family flying back to SD Monday morning to make it to the Monday Night Football game against the Steelers.    My first mistake? Wearing my Chargers jersey while flying out of Pittsburgh airport. Im at a food joint in the airport when a giant black hand grabs my shoulder and spins me around Pittsburgh cop glaring at me saying you got some balls wearing that jersey here! Scares the shit out of me then he gives me this huge grin. We sit down together and I start answering all his questions about what its like to live in a town like San Diego.  My second mistake? I got caught up talking to the cop and missed my flight. I was able to score another flight two hours later but Im gonna miss the beginning of the game. As it turns out during my layover I got a message from my buddy who Im supposed to go to the game with hes flying in from Dallas got snow bound in Denver also going to be late for the game. We end up at Lindbergh Field at the same time more than enough time to catch the second half unfortunately he had his girlfriend use his ticket. We take a cab to my place grab my truck and I drop him off at the stadium. Gave him my ticket so he could watch with his girl. Joke was on him we lost the game.,sandiego,dceqwcs,3,t5_2qq2q

10433163,0,t1_dcqls0c,Thank you for the thoughtful reply.gt when feminists talk about patriarchy they arent talking about white men they are criticizing scripts in our culture that we all act on unless we are aware of it. Alright then please have them say that... the current  word is divisive.I can understand awareness and presence of mind in actions as well as in behaviors.  Thats fine... its nice to say but in complete honestly I know quite a few women that simply dont want it... when it really gets down to it I honestly suspect that the approach is wrong and that the underlying basis is ignoring fundimental factors that we may not understand about ourselves as human beings. Regardless  its difficult to live mindfully  of the time.... we naturally economize ourselves into routines and rules of behavior.  That is what youre attempting to change  I understand... but its a likely to have unexpected repercussions.   if it gains mass appeal.By the same token you have to acknowledge that this is a societal issue and we all have to be included in it... together.Firstly I suggest using a gender neutral word to describe the cultural habits and scripts you mentioned... thats a good place to start.gt  It is hardest and most frustrating to point out the problems with patriarchy to some white men because these scripts give white men the biggest free pass to act out in shameful waysand it is hard for anyone to accept shame for things you didnt even realize were wrong at the time or that you actually enjoyed. That is true....  but it also works equally both ways.  perhaps you should watch this film from a feminist on what is largely ignored male issuesgt That resistance  bias against seeing the harms you cause for your own personal gain  is frustratingYes I expect that true equality is going to get resistance from both sides as some people have their own gender based rules and cultural allowances that theyre going to be very reluctant to give up.    I have had this discussion before with different people and many from this side of the issue will acknowledge that theres a rather significant faction that is using this as a platform to gain power and dominance against other women as well as males... that they themselves are part of the problem that the movement has to contend with. In all honestly Im not sure that this is the correct path as males and females as people are different our minds and subcultures are different accordingly.The yin and yang of taoism are equal and complimentary and I strongly tend to think that is how its all evolved to work.. naturally. Nothing is going to be perfect for all people but we do in fact need to acknowledge some things as adults and I see some very vocal people taking their personal frustrations as being oddballs and wrapping them in the cloak of equality for their own personal advantage.  But that might be a different conversation.Again than you for your level headed reply. ,sandiego,dcqo2nu,-1,t5_2qq2q

Sometimes people doesnt understand is when you dislike something and something else dislike what you dislike doesnt make that something else to be great.  The Chinese government might not be most peoples favorite and so is our own government China was invaded by the European and the Japanese the country was taken apart by outsiders do you really expect them to value things the same as Americans its not plausible. However Dalai Lama honors slavey kills innocent people should really not be honored.

10676975,0,t3_5sqpuq,Geico is the absolute worst when dealing with auto claims. Since you said his truck was insured you will start dealing with his insurance company instead of Geico hopefully they also dont have Geico.Since it doesnt sound like you have any medical bills it really isnt in your best interest to hire an attorney. Pain and suffering is usually valued at x your medical bills and without medical bills its hard to get anything above out of pocket expenses. All they can do is try to negotiate the value of your vehicle and help you get minimal payments above and beyond that for expenses. Based on how much you will have to pay an attorney you will not likely make out better in the long run.Remember you do not have to accept the offer the insurance company makes you. You can counter offer. You can reject it and sue him yourself without an attorney. There are form complaints made for auto accidents for suing people. If he was driving a work truck you could sue the employer for respondent superior this helps if he was on the clock when it happened. Be patient find out the other drivers insurance company and contact them ASAP. Geico may also try to get reimbursement from the other company for anything they have paid so far such as for tow truck and rental cars. Its not going to be a fast process. If luck is on your side they will have USAA insurance. ,sandiego,ddh8zlz,9,t5_2qq2q

You mounted your high horse and said well that may be okay with YOU essentially and responded as if you did not see what them saying that the last line fucks up the rest. You said offering a gift certificate is bribery. None of your response meshes with what youre now claiming that youre okay with the first part but not the last part.

Lowlevel use of force such as physical strength controlled holds and Taser warnings is up . percent.So the title imo is not misleading. Cops are using highlevel use of force less often with body cameras. Whether thats from the Cops knowing that they will get caught if theyre assholes or if people are being more calm due to knowledge of the camera is up to debate.

I liked NU cos I got my degree done and it got done fast. The nursing component must be doing well because most of my cohort got hired in the hospital systems relatively quickly. MOST of the teachers are great. They know their stuff and offer a lot of help outside of the class. The facilities are nice and mostly accessible all over the county which was great for study groups and such.On the other hand it seemed like sometimes no one really knew what was going on what they were doing and would try to put the blame on you when its clear that the problem occurred on their side. For a school that was so expensive its disheartening. Its frustrating cos you dont always get the answers you want when you need them. You had to figure out who was the worker you can trust to actually help you. Personally Im thankful that I had NU to get my degree quickly and I got a job in an oversaturated new grad RN market.

At least Democrats have intellectual honestycapability to criticize their own. Trumpies dont have that capacity theyre dogmatic in their support because they dont actually give a shit about anything other than feeling better than liberals. If it pisses off liberals you support it it it doesnt you dont thats the depth if your political analysis. But Ive already seen how this plays out  years from now youll just deny you were ever a supporter. Just like when I protested the Iraq war in San Diego all these idiots called us terrorist sympathizers and attacked our patriotism I bet you even supported the war. Not even a decade goes by and all of those idiots wont say a fucking word about it now theyll deny it was ever even them. People that are so easily swayed by the cult of personality that is trump are just like him in the sense they can NEVER be wrong.

11736634,0,t1_dgpn8bn,Im making a very clear and concise argument that racism and white privilege exist and are pervasive. Just like climate change exists is real and is pervasive.Racism and privilege are systematic.Heres something to think onAs a white person I had been taught about racism as something which puts others at a disadvantage but had been taught not to see one of its corollary aspects white privilege which puts me at an advantage . . . I was taught to see racism only in individual acts of meanness not in invisible systems conferring domination on my group.Wont bother linking to who said it as you can easily google but probably wont. Just think on the idea that privilege isnt necessarily an act of meanness instead its the fact that whether you want to believe in them or not there exist entire systems put in place which confer people in America and most western society who were born with a deficiency in melanin and people who were born with male genitalia domination.Think on this excerpt from a well written essaySuch institutional expressions of privilege are not readily perceived by Whites as privilege but as the normal dayin and dayout opportunities of life to which everyone has access. However when as a result of demographic and political changes Whites see their status and the landscape of social power changing this heretofore unseen privilege now becomes most visible. We are probably never so aware of phenomena and objects as when we are about to gain or lose them. Conversely we never take them so much for granted as when we are assured in their possession. When threatened this previously unseen privileged status becomes something to be protected at all costs. Blacks tend to do the same when they sense Latinos and Asians encroaching on their hardfought gains and privileges. This kind of exclusive behavior cuts across all race groups not just Whites and is correlated with a sense of a loss of power and privilege. Langdon Gilkey puts it this way. When people give their ultimate devotion to their own welfare or to the welfare of their group they are no longer free to be completely moral or rational when they find themselves under pressure. Whenever the security of the object of this commitment is threatened they are driven by an intense anxiety to reinforce that security.,sandiego,dgqdl99,1,t5_2qq2q
11782451,0,t3_683zl0,Okay  I spent most of my adult life broke as all hell not anymore  but my habits are rather ingrained in me by this point so Im going this is my advice  Cars are used paid for out of pocket so Ive never had a car payment Im talking like    early s Ford Taurus type things. There is no point buying a new car because its only going to depreciate in value.   Cheaper  door vehicles generally have cheaper insurance mine runs around  for renters insurance and car.  I owned a flip phone until around  when I finally got a job that paid gthr  so my cell plan was like mo for unlimited talktext. Ive always lived close to mass transit lived in cheap though fairly sketchy areas and walked a ton. So Id consider places along the trolley line  lemon grove on the orange line which goes to La Mesa or even in La Mesa with roommates.  I never had cable owned a television paid for very basic internet and computers were cheap laptops Ive lived places with TVs since then but after going years not using them or playing games its really hard to get into so I just dont bother. Clothing was buy and sell  thrift stores mainly and Id sell it back when I didnt need it anymore to places like Crossroads or Buffalo Exchange.  Entertainment books from the library walking around the city trying to meet people looking into freecheap events people watching ect. Food  less is very cheap for groceries so if you can find one  thats the best place to go.   I was able to live on mo doing that. ,sandiego,dgvkuoy,12,t5_2qq2q
