7046600,0,t1_d14nv72,Apparently the gene SCNA among others has already been isolated as the gene behind pain perception. So theoretically we could just use genome editing through CRISPR to turn that gene off or do some slightly more intricate procedure. But do you mean nociceptors? Those could probably be knocked out on their own Id imagine. The dulling of senses in general if you only mean physical pleasure and pain might be kind of cool making us into Vulcanlike creatures Id probably give up physical pleasure for a lack of pain. But that might not be necessary plus theres the thought that maybe the good feeling I associate with finding out something true might just be a fleeting physical release instead of something truly mindopening ? but I generally value that feeling more than anything else in life so it would be a pretty big blow if I lost that and I probably wouldnt want to live anyway. But yeah Id be interested to see how exactly turning off a gene would manifest itself and Id kind of dip my toe in that water although Id probably learn a lot of interesting stuff from that,Futurism,d1f392f,1,t5_2qnw4
