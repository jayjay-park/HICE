6627786,0,t1_d04v01e,Im reading the card list that someone posted and while there are small changes the design is the same. Buffs everywhere and little else. Buffs are boring. Some taunt some ranged some protection some deathtouch some card draw some faeria gain some land creation. Thats it. A design space so small youd need a microscope to find complexity. Strategy for every single deck get a big creature next to their orb. How you get that big creature next to their orb changes slightly from deck to deck but thats all that changes.,faeria,d04vc4j,1,t5_2v2l8
6683392,0,t1_d0am8i8,I like gold because it creates more decision points. Even just building your deck you needed to think about gold. Faeria didnt even exist for the first few turns because you could only get it when it spawned during night. You needed to have enough gold only units for your early game or to try to come back if you planned poorly and spent all your faeria and your collectors got killed. It just adds more complexity over all and while I understand that may not be a good thing for everyone for me it adds to the game. Faeria was a limited premium resource. It was fun. It felt powerful using it.,faeria,d0amdhi,2,t5_2v2l8

7218082,0,t3_4eb6ci,Great to hear!Im sure youre also keeping tabs on Crows thread for Sundays tourny but Ill go ahead and echo some comments here as well as some previously made in Discord for the purposes of further discussion.  As a player in the tournament I cant really speak to the total length in this regard as I managed  twice over for... reasons.  I like the move to a Swiss format though.  More opportunity for any individual player to have successfully read the meta and more chances to lose for scrub homebrew junkies like myself. P As you have already addressed it would be great to have someone behindthescenes handling players.  Bracket management round pairings announcements running down noshows conflict resolution etc... A full document of rules may be worth working up.  I recall a couple of concerns coming up that needed to be clarified in the moment rather than having a document to point to and say see says so right here.As a viewer to TotO As you have also already touched on there were a few technical issues compounded by the stream delay which might have been avoided entirely with a little more setup time.  It happens to the best of them though.  Official MTGWOTC tourny streams were a nightmare there for a while. Personally I would have liked to hear more discussion about the decks we were seeing.  The casting has been on point for all the tournaments thus far complete with a handful of drawcalls.  It could only help that situation if the casters were better able to talk to possible outs and swing cards.      From a player perspective maybe its not the most ideal thing to have your entire decklist plastered up on screen for your future opponents to see... but honestly if they are watching they are going to know most of it anyway and can probably guess most of the rest.  I had been watching a bit after my first match only to realize after refreshing the brackets that I was actually watching the match which would decide who I was playing in round .  In the interest of fairness I at least offered to share my colors with my opponent before our match. P As uEternalRequiem noted in Crows thread it may be wise to make certain concessions towards the newbie audience.  His recommendation for explanatory gifs to pop up on screen was a great one.  That might be difficult to achieve with rotating casters though as only you will have access to stream controls.  Even if its something as small as just having the casters talk about some of the more obvious plays and how they impact the game though it may help draw in new viewership.,faeria,d1yn23d,2,t5_2v2l8

7516472,0,t1_d2eai6u,To help you get started play cards that can kill more in than one card your opponent plays. Red yellow and green all are good for that. Direct damage creature removal yellow and buffs all tilt the game in your favor.Just remember that your opponent plays these cards as well and your creature needs to be in position to strike to apply its power. I am often amazed by a creature being buffed with two or three more cards as it walks towards a location where it can hurt me and just before it could do first damage I take it out with one card.Save your fire till you need it. These three buffs can be played in the turn you can apply their effect.

8151628,0,t3_4qwx6x,. Mono and Dual seem to be the most popular choices. I run a few Tri and Ive never seen Quad pulled off.. Blue is jack of all trades Green is like Forest from MTG heavy ramp Neutral is typical lower end cards with some surprises Mountain has some tricks while being spell heavy and Desert is a mix of Swamp and Plains from MTG. Green is probably the only color who needs to Dual color if they want to dip into Aggro.. Ive been playing for  days and hardcore rush decks are rare.  it seems. Most rush decks Ive seen are actually more on par with Midrange. If you smack down a hardcore rush deck too quickly most just surrender. YellowRed is great for this and somewhat Blue.. No ideaThe game is pretty fun and has a lot of interesting cards. Tho some cards are just really strong in my opinion but not that bad.

8613958,0,t3_4xsqt5,Im pretty new so take this with a grain of salt. But the way I look at it is this.It cost  draws a card and discounts it. The discount is equal to the average card cost in your deck which is around .   for me.That means its a  faeria  with charge  that draws a card. Having a draw a card effect is slightly below  faeria I think so the cost goes down to around  faeria for . For comparison Tyranax is  with  lake requirement and cost  faeria.At  faeria you get Verduran Force which is  for  forest requirement which should beat Magnus so the optimal end price of magnus should be around  faeria. Meaning the card draw  faeria discount should be  faeria minimum.As a rule of thumb Id say if you lack card draw i.e. you run out of cards lategame and your average card cost is above  faeria then magnus is quite okay. At around  faeria he becomes quite good.Ideally I see him being used with blue decks because they reward playing high cost  or more faeria cards,faeria,d6icbuk,1,t5_2v2l8

10451305,0,t3_5pnxic,I believe people get the pw impression because at a superficial glance the system looks like the pw system of HS Same rarities  cards per chest chests cost  gold dailies are g.Despite these seeming similarities you can achieve a full collection in Faeria in  months playing of dailies and some Pandora without spending any real money.  A huge difference to HS are the MUCH better droprates of legendaries  in each  chests on average and epics  every  or  chests on average  taken from my own statistics of opening  chests so far.  You can reroll the rarest card so you have double the chance of getting something youre still missing compared to HS! Theres a lot of free stuff from solo content. Youre rewarded a lot of gold for just winning games  per win  for the first win of the day Pandora nets you quite a lot of gold as well.  You dont need a shitload of Legendaries to even get started. ,faeria,dcsr6kp,11,t5_2v2l8

10526743,0,t1_dcyuukh,That was very interesting to read. After reading it it reminded me about the earlier version of Faeria that shown Orobouros eating its own tail in the opening screen. Now we seem it only in the waiting time loading circle I believe. I also remember how Faeria used to change night to day which gave some cards different effects. I actually really liked that effect it was very unique!! However I believe the wells only refilled during the daytime and it would switch in a somewhat confusing manner.... like I wasnt sure when it would switch and it didnt seem intuitive. Looking back and considering now I would like to still see that night and day difference. Each player gets one turn of day then each gets one turn of night. I think this version did provide problems though which is why they chose to get rid of it. Does anyone remember why they changed it? Also I was hoping to hear a little about Ostregoth in this as the author of this post asked. I wonder if it would make sense that Ostregoth was actually one of the gods and before it could be eaten it locked itself in a place that could only be entered and exited through the doomgate. Of the four gods I think Astar would be Ostregoth because that god was god of the sky yellow desert I believe and since Doomgate and Ostregoth have yellow costs thats what I think. Very cool read indeed. Was this made by a fan or by devs?,faeria,dd1bkac,1,t5_2v2l8

11176130,0,t3_5zjlma,OK so  as to what you do with the gold if you want purely to get as many cards as possible your best best is to buy straight up battle chests with it.   As for if you wanna spend money the miner is the best bang for your buck.I suggest focusing on one or max  colour decks imo  red and yellow are the most fun but its all personal preference.In the beginning I would suggest not crafting a legendary early on as they arent super powerful need to have and crafting some more common cards to complete your deck will let you win more and get more in the long run.Charge how many spaces a creature can moveDash a creature can move an amount of spaces in a straight line from the land where it was summoned.my IGN is firecracko if you wanna play sometime,faeria,deysvie,2,t5_2v2l8

11240201,0,t3_60fmfx,Coming from a lot of Magic playing myself blue has a lot of control as expected. In fact the colors play as you would expect them too. Save for blue having jump which give more mobility and yellow having a lot of sacrifice.Interactivity is limited to your turn but saving cards is always good.The hex battlefield adds a whole other layer to the game that makes it stand out from MTG so you can really play any deck that turtles. Reviving from the graveyard doesnt exist in the game as far as I have seen so graveyard play doesnt really exist.All in all I guess just find a niche that kinda reminds you of something you like in magic?

If you are an active player get the hang of the game then use gold to buy pandora coins or  wins is equal to same gold you use to buy packs. Solo content can wait because you can do it whenever you want to. Ohh and if possible try to build a decent to do rank to get some reward from it. and this is my personal opinion Yellow is the fastest one if you dont like planning too much. blue is all about planning. red and green is somewhere in the middle i guess,faeria,dg0bk4k,2,t5_2v2l8

Sounds like you just dont understand the genre of game you are playing to be honest because most other online CCGs wish they had a playerbase that could support them having three major expansions per year Faeria will be fresh while you are still learning but once you put a ton of time in to it you will be thirsty for an expansion.Finally with the grind are you talking about the grind it takes to increase your collection? because that is a fair argument HS is definitely stingy on rewards or are you talking about the ladder grind? because every digital CCG has that.,faeria,dghc67u,4,t5_2v2l8
