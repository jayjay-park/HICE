5886079,0,t1_cxr4i8t,Git itself is likely not inclusive enough of nonsoftware folks but the concepts are definitely useful to think about. For instance pull requests to a recipe owner might be the key here.,cookingcollaboration,cxr75l3,1,t5_3b4jh
5913653,0,t1_cxulo4o,gtNow I guess Im more of a meat and cauliflower girl I am still on the hunt for a mashed cauliflower recipe that rivals mashed potatoes. That is one of my unicorn recipes.I generally try to cook lowcarbish if only because I dislike chopping potatoes and pasta gets old. Though I dont generally cook Keto or the like feel free to bring your recipes to the table or adapt mine into something healthier.,cookingcollaboration,cxut990,1,t5_3b4jh
5947104,0,t3_3vc13v,yearold novice here. I started cooking when I was  and only started being serious about it when I was  and moved away from home. I like finding exotic andor foreign recipes including Indian Greek and Italian who doesnt? I have an insanely good tikka masala recipe for the slow cooker and my chicken parm is better than my moms whoops.I enjoy making Southern comfort food like cube steak homemade biscuits and other fried things but my fiance and I are trying to eat healthier these days. I can bake up a damn storm though. I feel gypped that I didnt do anything more than boxed brownies as a kid because I am legitimately good at baking and could be so much further ahead if Id been allowed in the kitchen when I was younger. My specialties are breads and muffins banana cranberryorange lemon cookies cashew butter chocolate chip oatmeal cranberry and giant chocolate cakes. I suppose what Im trying to get out of this collab is a better knowledge of how different spices go together without just throwing stuff together and ruining my dish broader knowledge and range of cuisine I can prepare as well as a more comprehensive details on individual cooking methods. ,cookingcollaboration,cxz71sz,1,t5_3b4jh
