3845556,0,t1_cquk9gu,Ive been using plug.dj for a few months now its fantastic! The thing that keeps me from making a full commitment and im sure this is the same for many others is the lack of the mobile app. I know you know how badly we want it but saying that doesnt really do much.,grooveshark,cqumlk2,2,t5_2rdta
3851075,0,t1_cqutvg9,Thanks for the suggestion I will give it a go.,grooveshark,cqv9agl,1,t5_2rdta
3851115,0,t1_cquv3tq,It could grow to become what Grooveshark was but... I mean I opened it up typed in One Republic and they had nothing besides a few covers done by other artists. Ive tries some more obscure artists and they had nothing. They just dont have the library to back up their otherwise smooth website.,grooveshark,cqv9gdk,1,t5_2rdta
3859031,0,t3_34mi2v,They pay artists even if its really really low thats why plenty of artists pulled their music from Spotify,grooveshark,cqw5xk8,1,t5_2rdta
3867243,0,t1_cqx0gki,Yeah i know but i want Netease Music to be recognised by last fm scrobbler,grooveshark,cqx3l8i,1,t5_2rdta

3891917,0,t1_cqznb6d,Spotify is a garbage program that is incredibly overpriced. If you do use it I highly suggest EZBlocker.,grooveshark,cqzwv2n,6,t5_2rdta
3892573,0,t3_34yfwx,Just so everyone knows this isnt Grooveshark. This has nothing to do with old Grooveshark.This is a reskinned version of MPJuices an mp download search engine that has been playing whackamole for quite some time Look at the About pages the Privacy pages all of the content is exactly identical. Not to mention the song content being identical. This is clearly just sketchy people behind another sketchy website trying to legitimize their piracy by piggybacking a preexisting more established domain. ,grooveshark,cqzzk2s,16,t5_2rdta

3989891,0,t1_cramcwo,Yes Im in total agreement with that  Unfortunately apart from spotifydeezerrdio etc theres currently not much of a workaround though.,grooveshark,crb2yt6,1,t5_2rdta
5031620,0,t1_curq062,Looks nice so far do you think  in the future  you would be able to add  other features like broadcasting and friends and all of that that grooveshark had?,grooveshark,cusi2kp,1,t5_2rdta

8302053,0,t3_4d1ex7,I am assuming you have figured this out already but if not I can offer some advice geared towards AndroidIf youre transferring these songs to your phone then just download the Fildo app on your phone and then download the songs directly to your phone. The album art should already be included in the file. If is not then download Album Art Grabber and then download the art from there.For future reference this app is perfect for finding and fixing the album art in your music collection and I could not recommend it enough.,grooveshark,d5fbbvp,1,t5_2rdta
