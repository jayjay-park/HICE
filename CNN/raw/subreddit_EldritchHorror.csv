3361883,0,t3_2ykz0g,Youre competing against a game designed to destroy you. In that sense it is a competitive game. Youre playing against the designers. No matter how you look at it as the game stands currently you do not play against each other. If they want a Lovecraft themed game that is competitive then they can try Cthulu Wars where you play as the Gods taking over the world. I like to think of it as you couldnt contain it Arkham so you tried to save the world. Failed at that in Eldritch so you decided if you cant beat em join em in Cthulu wars heheheBut I digress. Eldritch is about the journey and joint struggle to save the world. Plus its based on the most influential writer of most horror writers today. If thats not enough to convince your friends to play Eldritch then at least its also one player right? ,EldritchHorror,cpbha2e,3,t5_35ss2

6285249,0,t3_41n7dx,I think rather than rebalancing you should have one player play Charlie and camp in London or Tokyo if you are finding it too difficult with . I like that in the base game that odd numbers are just structurally harder than even. It allows people to adjust the difficulty up or down by simply having one player play two characters.,EldritchHorror,cz428rk,1,t5_35ss2
6629347,0,t1_d0270c8,Preludes are the closest I could find at the moment but they seem either too strong or insignificant. Will report if I find anything else. Can you think of anything?,EldritchHorror,d051593,1,t5_35ss2
6763650,0,t1_d0indkg,Okay...that helps a little.  Tried playing it a couple times this evening but ran into a little issue thats not readily covered in the rules.  Exactly howwhen can spells be used?  For example offensive spellswhere do they fit into the scheme of combat?  I understand the combat mechanics of doing a Will Check and a Strength Check as is indicated on the back of a monsters tile.  However if there is a spell being used against the monsterwhere does that play into things?  Before the whole WillStrength check thing or after?Thanks!,EldritchHorror,d0ixssb,1,t5_35ss2
