958443,0,t3_251rv5,The reason why theres no recipe for a protein mask is...its fairly difficult to make such a mask at home.Im assuming that by mask you mean you want something that will penetrate hair and deliver some moisturization beyond surfacelevel film forming?Heres a brief rundown of protein effects from Cosmetics and Toiletries.  As they say the effect of the protein is quite dependent on its molecular weight.  The molecular weight of the protein they mention hydrolyzed vegetable protein meaning it has been specifically processed to be smaller for penetration is  Daltons.  Compare that to the molecular weight of ovalbumin the main protein in eggs  Daltons  Leaving something like eggs on your hair for hours at a time doesnt have much point because the protein is just too large to do anything other than form a film over the surface of your hair like any conditioner will do and it wont stick to hair as effectively since its not charged like many other agents.Basically a mask would have to involve hydrolyzed proteins which you cant really make at home.  I guess if someone were superinto homecrafting you could follow something like this but youd have to buy ingredients and its not something Id just want to start making for myself with no experience.Coconut oil has zero protein in it so I dont see why that would be an issue.  Ive seen people claim on this board that coconut oil somehow is structurally similar to protein but as far as I know no ones ever shown any proof of it and that would be quite a claim for an oil to somehow mimic a protein.,HaircareScience,chd8fe8,3,t5_2y8kx
962461,0,t1_chdnlj9,Ooh Woah. Hard to say. if your split ends are that bad it might be catching up on each other causing it to make more damage whilst grabbing more in. If its split to death the only thing to do is cut it all off and start fresh. I did this with a girl friends when hers was so damaged from a different stylist. Those under cuts on long hair are so cool and thats what I did on her and now is growing out all healthy. But I still go back during her regular cuts and trim it even though its far shorter.

I rotate between sulfate and non sulfate as we have well water and I need to clarify often but when I do clarify I deep condition.  But I never heat style or blow dry and only wash every other day.  I also rotate between silicone and non silicone.  That way Im never getting too much buildup or too much drying out.

Anecdotally polyquat may build up for some people but YMMV this is a conditioning agent so replaces the need for silicones.

Also in theory I dont think one should even get buildup from a shampoo bar unless . you didnt clarify before beginning the use of the bars or . youre needing an acidic rinse and your ratio of dilution is off. Also many people benefit from lathering twice with the bar. I personally dont need to but some do.

1900951,0,t3_2gdbr6,I most definitely agree that androgen hormones could be at play here since your hair texture changed hints towards hormones and the hair loss was progressive androgenic alopecia is not immediate hair sheds normally but eventually no new hair replaces the old because the follicle miniaturizes over time.  However with that being said something up with your androgens is not always PCOS.  For example another cause of your androgen levels being off could be caused by your thyroid.Our bodies have a fairly delicate balance of interactions so if one thing is off it could disrupt others and many different symptoms overlap.  So Im glad youre getting in to see the doctor I think a full workup would probably be a good idea.  And Id definitely suggest getting your iron checked again.  Each lab has different values for what they consider normal or not and those values are just averages.  Some people can have a minor deficiency but they show symptoms Im like that for my b while others are still mostly fine.  So a slight deficiency could definitely contribute to hair loss.,HaircareScience,cki94wg,2,t5_2y8kx

1942267,0,t1_ckn7fsb,Its not that SLS is horrible or should never be used in fact our cowashing guide advocates occasional clarifying but it does have some factual proven downsides that mean that for many people its not the best thing to use regularly.The primary one is that washing with SLS and ALS results in more protein loss from hair than just water or even other cleansers this study pg. .  If youre trying to grow your hair out or are splitend prone this is of particular concern.The other is that SLS is known for causing scalp irritation.  In most people who rinse their hair fully thats not too much of a concern because its in contact with your scalp for a short time.  However for people who perhaps dont rinse well enough or who are particularly sensitive eliminating SLS and ALS can be helpful.  We get so many my scalp is itchy! posts it can be a helpful first step.  Similarly because SLS is an effective cleanser it can strip your scalps oil barrier which may also irritating depending on your sensitivity same goes for any of your skin.There are other reasons people choose to move away from SLS and ALS related to the hair texture they personally want to achieve but the two reasons discussed above are actual facts.  People can be overly dogmatic about the issue but there are genuine reasons.,HaircareScience,ckn8qgs,6,t5_2y8kx

They work wonderfully for the little touch ups you need to do and I also use them for trimming my eyebrows yay caterpillars!. Otherwise if you have a friend whos a beauty student or has their license you can ask if theyd be willing to stop at their local wholesale outlet and pick you up a pair if you front the cash. Those arent the nice  ones theyre a little better than what Sallys sells at the same price of whats at Sallys. Ive had my Sallys pair for about  years and am probably going to retire them shortly. So the life span isnt bad. I havent checked out their online store but they might even sell them there. EDIT! Keep in mind if you do buy shears dont ever use them on anything but your hair. Got an itchy tag or even a loose thread in your shirtget the craft scissors. The edge on hair shears is super fine and anything harder than hair will put a tiny nick in the blades. ,HaircareScience,ct4po7a,8,t5_2y8kx

Use the gentlest one you can get away with as infrequently as you can tolerate.  I have no strong opinion on the color depositing kind as long as its a decent shampoo otherwise.  Use conditioners to add those oils and strengthening ingredeints something you can leave on your head long enough to soak in a bit or do a deep conditioning with or a nice lighweight leavein conditioner.Most of the fancy ingredients they put in rinseoff products like shampoo facewash body wash etc are largely just there to make you buy it.  A product that is designed to cleanse will be quite limited in its ability to also bind something to your hair  working at cross purposes.

Then one day I noticed that when I was shampooing my hair that spot with the weird texture was where I plomped the first glob of shampoo. I started varying where I put the shampoo and the texture improved.So where do you usually plomp your shampoo? Is it on your fuzzy bit? Could the way that you sleep affects that bit of hair more than the rest? Do you have a favorite hat that could be the culprit? Do you absentmindedly mess with your fuzzy tuft?

In order for places that charge . even  for a cut to money need to be doing a haircut in  mins or making a dollar a min. That means no shampoo and conditioner which is so important to be evenly wet for a cut. A spray bottle just doesnt cut it and is uncomfortable and makes me feel like Im dealing with a naughty cat. Also leaving wet. That means they arent checking the cut. Some hair needs dry cutting. Cutting wet removes bulk and weight cutting dry makes movement and texture. Both important things in a cut. If your really worried its bad have them style it straight and not with an ironunless your hair is super curly it will need an iron.Youll know immediately. Ask is a salon has a rank system. For your first spot spend the big bucks then just let the stylist know its out of your price range and if she could refer you to a coworker.

5812240,0,t3_3uqu52,Are you talking natural black?  Your hair is naturally black and you want to lighten it to a dirty blonde?  I dont know if thats the case but if it is then youll be lucky to pull a medium brown for your first session of lightening and toning unless youre planning to hit it with a heavy duty bleach which I highly suggest you dont just for the same of your hair.  You can only pull maybe  levels safely at a time which would leave you at about a  hot orangey color.  After that you need to tone out with a blue base toner wait at least  weeks before trying to lighten it more which is still pretty iffy for the last few inches for your hair.  As for the shampoo question?  Shampoo immediately after you lighten to get all the chemicals off your hair and scalp to avoid over processing and chemical burns.  Then dont wash for at least  hours.

6076571,0,t3_3u5iv5,Even though this is an old post I HAVE to share what works!For the past year I have been almost obsessed with fixing the brassy orange shade that my light brown hair always seems to be. Even when my stylist would color over it with an ash brown it would still be very noticeably orange. She told me that it was simply the color that my hair pulled since I have colored over my true color so many times and the only way to really eliminate it would be to go a darker brown.I took it upon my self to try almost everything I could find online that could fix brassy light brown hair. I tried numerous toners food coloring semi and demi permanent colors ardells unred purple shampoo literally everything!Then I finally found the ONE thing that works!ION COLOR BRILLIANCE ASH INTENSIFIERIt is an additive for hair color but I bought it because a woman who works at Sallys told me that a customer uses it to tone the roots of her red hair to ash brown without any developer or anything. I decided Id give it a try.I mixed half of the small tube with conditioner a little goes a long way and applied it all over my toweldried hair. I let it sit for about  minutes and washed it out.Im used to being disappointed so when I started blow drying my hair and saw a beautiful natural looking ash brown color I was floored! All of my highlights were toned as well! It has been about two weeks and it has not faded back to orange at all but if it does I still have half the tube left and it was only  dollars and it was pretty easy the first time I did it. Although I will say my hair does look maybe a shade at best darker than it was before. I think this is because the orange color absorbed light more than the brown does. I absolutely love the shade but expect that your color may look just a bit darker. Perhaps if you leave it on for less time it will not darken at all.If you have brassy brown hair I seriously recommend you try this product!,HaircareScience,cyg4g9x,1,t5_2y8kx
6153505,0,t3_3ztu9e,Coconut oil is good for getting out color and is actually good for your hair! But be careful you mentioned fine hair which might look oily if you dont rinse the oil out well enough I like to work in my shampoo as best as I can BEFORE rinsing because water and oil repel each other and the shampoo can loosen the oil before the water just slicks off of it. Also be aware that some peoples hair gets too much protein but two or three coconut oil treatments shouldnt cause too big of an issue there. Just use virgin cold pressed coconut oil. Warm it up between your hands and work it through dry hair. Let it sit for at least an hour but I sleep on mine if I can. ,HaircareScience,cyp38fe,3,t5_2y8kx

I always found that you need to give color two weeks  of your normal washing and drying etc before really seeing what it is going to look like long term. If the black is just a bit too dark right away live with it for two weeks as it will fade some on its own during that time.Otherwise youd need to do a hair color remover and redye your hair.

10048853,0,t1_dbh0jh6,If I am understanding the above link correctly the biggeat concern regarding sulfates overdrying and regular use are that it strips too much sebum to be used on a daily basis if the concentration is too high it looks like its foaming qualities could lead to a lot of constant strippage of the hair shaft leading to a duller appearance and that attempts to mitigate this only last until next wash due to coatings vs actual hair shaft impact. It also looks like and maybe I am misreading that attempts to mitigate this with conditioning qualities can lead to a coating along the scalp that is more difficult to rinse depending on he items used and that the sulfates help spread the shampoo but dont cleanse in their own so it is ineffecient jn that way compared to other primar cleansers.For dyed hair it seems to make it more prone to breakage and somrthing about ionizationph balance? It sounds like it would be more realistic to advise those with brittledry hair frequent shower folks and dyed hair to avoid sulfates more versus suggest everyone be sulfate free?Also it sounds like proper rinsing and consumer awareness of ingredients would be better but I could see it being a sort of shortcut to avoid sulfates vs use cosdna on every shampoo.Your post is very relevant though thanks for asking for the science because I also dont see a ton of studies versus common advice lt,HaircareScience,dbhe3ah,11,t5_2y8kx
10091010,0,t3_5kboi3,I would suggest saving the money you would use on Olaplex to get a deep conditioning treatment professionally done somewhere. If you arent planning on buying Olaplex from a salon or licensed retailer all online sellers arent guaranteed reputable then it could arrive watered downtapered with.Next does your hair feel better after the coconut oil masks? They work well for many people but they can actually have opposite effects for specific hair types. For example my hair has never felt worse than when I put coconut oil in it. If this is the case for you or if you are interested in trying something else I would recommend Argan oil. The brand Hask is really cheap and it has worked wonders on my hair.Lastly yes it is normal for your hair to be that dry especially after bleaching it so many times. Did you bleach your hair four times in one sitting? One week even? If so this is really bad for your hair. Even bleaching your hair once can be extremely damaging. I would advise waiting a month AT LEAST in between bleaching if you bleach in the future. And to lessen damage in future bleaches try a test strand of argan oil or coconut oil if it does really work for your hair type soak your hair in it then bleach once the oil is absorbed. If this seems better on your piece of hair then use this method on the rest of your head. I have relatively damaged hair. My hair has been recovering for a year or so from repeated bleaches similar to you and THERE IS HOPE. I would recommend no brushing if you can manage as this will cause more breakage on your already fragile hair. In order to detangle my hair I mix a leave in conditioner with equal parts argan oil and comb it through with my fingers and this usually does the trick as long as I dont go to sleep with wet hair. Sorry this was so long. And I hope this helps. If you need anything else feel free to PM me! ,HaircareScience,dbmvihd,10,t5_2y8kx
10136735,0,t1_dbohuct,Instead of bleaching everything if you havent already you can washdry all your stuff bedding blankets pillows etc. in hot waterextra dry. Ive been getting lice constantly since I was in elementary school and its definitely a huge pain!Youre absolutely right about the itching  its an allergic reaction to the lice so not everyone itches when they have it. Overwashing your hair wont help get rid of them since they prefer clean hair so if you can tolerate an extra day or two between washes it may help. uGlamtechbrenda is right about the dry shampoo it could help you tolerate a few more days between washes and also the greasy bangs issue. Ive tried most everything to get rid of lice including a shampoo that looked like literal baby poop and smelled awful and I find that Nix works the best but youd need to set aside a couple hours for the process. Seeing as how you live alone you may have better luck combing one thin layer at a time so definitely a couple hours haha starting from the bottom. Or if youd like to concentrate on specific areas lice tend to lay their eggs in the crown area base of neck and behind ears. I know thats most of the head but at least you might be able to cut down on some combing time if you only had to do a light combing of the topfront area of your head.As for the dermatitis issue coconut oil may help Im not sure though! I just have a regular groceryfood jar of coconut oil from walmart that I put in some warm water for a few minutes to get it to a liquid and then add a bit to my hair at a time until its all evenly covered and youre feeling hella greasy and go to bed with an old towel on my pillow and my hair in a loose bun to keep it relatively contained but a shower cap would work too and keep it warmer!I hope this helps even a little!,HaircareScience,dbstk2v,1,t5_2y8kx

If you already do that look into oilsshampoo sulphate free. From the picture I would guess you blowdry your hair dont use high heat without a heat protectant and even then move the nozzle around a tun to reduce spikes in heat on one area. From one dude to another best of luck. If youre worried about having too many products dont. Find what you like and keep it but dont be scared to switch it up sometimes.

10987555,0,t3_5wwfqn,If your problem is actually dry skin you need to stop drying it out further with things like tea tree oil mint and dandruff care. You need to moisturize it instead. Have you tried cowashing? Using a cowash would help a lot because it would be moisturizing your scalp instead of stripping it dry.Dry skin btw can be handled a lot like dry hair. Apply lotion to damp skin and if you have really dry areas usually heels and elbows you can apply petroleum jelly or albas unpetroleum jelly but thats expensive to use in any quantity directly after the lotion. For my feet I do lotion over damp skin then petroleum jelly then cotton socks to seal it all in. If Im wearing shoes I cant wear socks with I still keep the socks on while Im finishing getting ready.
