2322603,0,t3_2lwcoa,Yep Tommy and I had been discussing a few options and I really liked that one as well. Were still a ways from getting it as it is rarity . So wed need to get our duty to pop twice plus Borgas favor to get it.,shadowofthebroker,clysczv,2,t5_348df

5404110,0,t1_cw2e4sl,Ehhh not always.  I could see an argument that there has to be enough reality in a cover that they are not constantly lying.  They are merely doing other stuff on the side.,shadowofthebroker,cw2foih,0,t5_348df
