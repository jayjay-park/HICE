3788700,0,t1_cqnyes1,I have Minecraft on my PC  as well as Steam. I would love to try Tekkit! Every time I see mods for Skyrim especially the one that turns dragons into characters from Thomas the Tank Engine I get really excited.  ,CatholicGamers,cqo54b2,2,t5_2y7ez
3946625,0,t1_cr6532r,They both give me so much nostalgia. I remember when Pokemon Diamond and Pearl came out. I got my parents to get me Diamond and played it for a while. Then when Pokemon Platinum came out Diamond came out of my life and I played the heck out of it.,CatholicGamers,cr65e6q,2,t5_2y7ez

4634692,0,t3_3eg87a,I really like your reviews and in particular the writing and delivery are spot on. It seems youre a fan of the work done on Extra Credits another show I enjoy.One concern I have though is how youve highlighted your Catholicism in the channels name. It seemed to me that your reviews dont often talk about faith or religion in gaming for longer than  seconds DA Origins is the exception I think that game makes the discussion of representation of religion in games very pertinent and so Im curious as to why youve decided to highlight your own faith as you have.Dont mistake me! I think we need Catholics in gaming culture. But I wonder if you arent hamstringing your opportunity to reach people and therefore be that voice for Christ in gaming which is so sorely lacking by causing people who would otherwise like and subscribe to your channel to pass you over imaginingas I almost didthat youre writing for fussy parents of young children.Jim Gaffigan comes to mind who although he is a Catholic with aspects of his faith informing his material nevertheless does not bill himself as a Catholic comic. Nor did someone like Tolkien bill himself as a Catholic storyteller yet his Catholicism also very much informed his works and they have done a great deal to bring his readers closer to God. These men are not hiding their faith for popular appeal. Rather it simply isnt pertinent to the projects theyre undertaking. That seems also to be the case here.These are just my two cents. Perhaps I am overthinking things. But you might do well to reassess what it is youre trying to accomplish with the channel and see how well its name reflects that goal.,CatholicGamers,cterss1,3,t5_2y7ez
6810193,0,t1_d0o4fic,Personally Im enjoying it alot.  The tutorial is very short and actual games vs real opponents in real time usually last within  minutes.  I recommend at least trying it out before deciding if its for you or not since the learning system is fast and easy.  Its one of those games where its easy and fast to learn but a bit more complex to master so to speak.  There is a grind when it comes to getting a hold of more cards and leveling the cards up themselves but there is no energy system that limits how much you want to play the game at any time.  You can play the game as much as you want without restrictions.,CatholicGamers,d0o8dgu,1,t5_2y7ez
