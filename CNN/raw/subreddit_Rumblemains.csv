6825135,0,t3_45u28a,Depends on what Im doing.  For lane DFT all the way but with the increased viability of Jungle Rumble Thunderlords Decree is better for the burst in early ganks to get ahead.  Another option is Strength of Ages in jungle only so you can be tanky and scale better vs harder to gank teams or when youre on a team that doesnt have a strong frontline.,Rumblemains,d0pxfci,2,t5_34mvx

9413713,0,t3_58a0u9,Ignite will definitely fall off quickly on Rumble I mean in a winning lane at a certain point youre basically able to mow people down just with Liandrys anyway. Plus he is a great champion to make tp plays on. I personally always ask for my bot lane to deep ward so I can gank ASAP after  considering Equalizer will destroy nearly every adc or at least force both enemy flashes. My personal preference is utility and I much prefer Rylais than Void considering its natural synergy with Linadrys which is indisputably THE best item on Rumble Ill fight anyone that says otherwise!. ,Rumblemains,d9995h6,1,t5_34mvx

10044451,0,t1_dbgo8n8,I know we can stack q without cdr. But every spam gives you  heat without cdr. If you take  flat cdr in runes every spam gives you  heat and that makes overheating easier. Your main damage in first clear comes from autos and so a little cdr and attack speed is useful.Cdr runes are never wasted. Cdr is a useful thing in any situation any minute any game.But yes attack speed runes are wested after a point. Runes are usually for early game.,Rumblemains,dbgtg93,1,t5_34mvx
